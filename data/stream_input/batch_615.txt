B00005JN2Z|4.0|If you like Tom Cruise's acting, see the movie.  If you like Jamie Foxx's acting, see the movie.  Well done by both.  Great direction and great score.
0930289528|1.0|I realize that by writing this review I'll probably have a fatwa issued against me by the comic book fan community, but this graphic novel was a major disappointment.  I came to it because I liked the movie so much.  I found it to be misogynistic and tedious to read (entire paragraphs of text repeated, as if the writer couldn't think of enough to fill out his story).  The artwork was ugly.  The plot lines were sometimes hard to swallow, characters' motivations not believable.  It was the spark of a great idea that the movie producer(s) turned into something excellent.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|I equate this movie to a modern-day fable.  It tries to teach lesssons using contemporary situations.  It's not anti-Western civilization...it emphasizes freedom of thought.    It's worth watching.  Check out how the Wachowski brothers outdo the \\"bullet ripple\\" effect that was in the Matrix.
0684824906|5.0|What a tremendous undertaking this book must have been.  It is both a partial biography of several great men and a wonderful political history of one of the most tumultuous periods of American History.  She really highlights two qualities in Abraham Lincoln.  First, he must have had tremendous self-confidence to run for President at all, given that his political experience consisted of a single, unremarkable term in the House of Representatives and a failed run for the Senate.  And to put together a cabinet of rivals shows that Lincoln had faith in his abilities and convictions far beyond his experience.  Second, his ability to make this compilation of rival egos work as a team, and to win them over to his side, for the most part, shows how great Lincoln really was.  Perhaps Lincoln should not be known as the Great Emancipator, but as the Great Placator since he spent much of his energy assuaging and stroking the egos in his cabinet, without ever giving in to them.<br /><br />Doris Kearns Goodwin has done a great job of illustrating the greatness of Abraham Lincoln, and showing why we revere him as one of our greatest figures.  After reading this book, I almost think that Lincoln is underrated as President, if that is possible.  I have long felt that FDR was the greatest president; now I am not so sure, thanks to Ms. Goodwin.<br /><br />I very strongly recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in the Civil War, American History, even just great men.  In fact, the story of Leo Tolstoy she relates at the end of the book is perhaps the greatest testimony to Lincoln's greatness -- and it is the most poignant, as well.
B0000009RX|5.0|We know he was a genius. Beneath all the arrogance and cynicisim. Past all the 6th grade bathroom humor. Beyond the anger - there was in Frank Zappa a heart   which cared for his fellow man, and the soul of a musician. <br /> <br />I didn't know what to make of this album when I began listening to it in 1968, till I heard The Chrome-Plated Megaphone of Destiny at the end. To my mind, this is a musical masterpiece equal to the works of any great composer. <br /> <br />Zappa was complex and didn't make it easy to see the beauty in his work. Don't take the bait - keep a very open mind, listen with your heart, and this album will reward you time and time again.
0790729628|4.0|Really enjoyed the setting, atmosphere of this movie. A dark, dirty city overcrowded with people and trash (although I thought there would be more flying cars), and huge electronic billboards, such as the Asian woman in the makeup of a geisha that we see repeatedly. It's kind of eerie when the billboards travel over the city on those slow-moving vehicles, invading peoples' homes with their light.  The rundown mansion-type house in the final scenes kind of reminded me of the castle from \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", strangely enough.<br /><br />A great sci-fi movie that is more thoughtful than just fantasy.  You'll end up thinking about it afterwards. And it seems that it could possibly happen in the future.  But I wish they would have shown some of the Off-World with all the other replicants as slaves.<br /><br />Towards the end of the movie, when Deckard (Harrison Ford) is trying to pull himself up on top of the building, there is a point when the camera focuses only on his hands as they come up over the ledge.  Watching his hands grip that ledge reminded me of Harrison Ford's character in \\"What Lies Beneath\\" - when he pulls himself up from the bathroom floor by gripping the edge of the bathtub.<br /><br />Didn't care much for the \\"love\\" scene.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I just watched this movie last night.  I came across the title on someone's MySpace and being a Jared Leto fan I wanted to watch it.  I had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting.   <br /> <br />Riveting is the very least I can say about this film.  It is as the Amazon editorial review puts it, \\"a tour through hell.\\"  This film makes you think.   The fact that all the addicts succumbed to their addictions seems a little out there to me but I keep wondering is it so far fetched . . . ?  How many people are there that actually DO escape addictions?  You might escape one but more than likely you will soon replace it with another. <br /> <br />During the film I kept trying to see the positive side of it all and hoping that there was some middle ground; some little piece of hope left.  I was wrong.  The film didn't depict drug use the way that I had expected to see it; the way I had seen it depicted in countless other films. <br /> <br />All of the ugly aspects of drug use were put out there for your viewing pleasure.  Personally I found it painful to watch.  There  were moments when I actually thought of turning it off but for some reason continued to watch.  I think that reason was the hypnotic trancelike style of the film.  The truth is that I COULDN'T stop watching.  The film put me directly in the shoes of the addict. <br /> <br />I felt like the addicts in the film  . . . my hands sweaty and my heart pounding.  I couldn't close my eyes.  I want to see it again sometime.  I would like to watch it with my husband.  I bought the movie before I had ever watched it the first time. <br /> <br />The film was painfully realistic, genuinely graphic, appalling and appealing at the same exact time.  A MUST see. <br /> <br />Overall I think it is a wonderful film to add to any collection.  Personally it is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched.  I think the acting in the movie was outstanding, the direction was genius, and the plot was amazingly horrific. <br /> <br />All in all this is an 5 star film.

B000007WNN|5.0|Personally, I think it's great they did'nt make \\"Love\\" part two, cause this album just kicks you in the face man! Don't get upset,\\"Lovies\\", here me out. I listened to nothing else but this album for a year, and even today it blows the doors off all this bubble gum punk/numetal/top40/MTV crap. \\"ELECTRIC\\" is an unadulterated rock album, comparison to anything else does'nt do it justice. Ian has the most powerful lungs you'll ever hear, and Duffy's guitar just punches through the walls. The band is just solid and the songs have alot of raw snap. This record does'nt need all the theatrics, the music is the epitome of energy(too much enthusiasm?(don't care!)). I'm not going to break down any songs or tracks cause they all stand up on thier own. After this album kicks you in the face, don't look up.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|One of the best live albums from the best musicians in popular music today.  The songs with the orchestra are really exceptional, as the orchestra really brings out the best in the music.  The live version of \\"Six Degrees\\" is overwhelming, and ends in majestic fashion, really one of the most memorable 42 minutes you will hear in music.  I was not thrilled with the songs selection, but after listening to it all the way through, it's perfect.  Don't buy this without buying the DVD also, which I feel is the best produced of their DVDs yet.  I have been to numerous DT concerts, and this DVD captures the feeling of being there to a T.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Originally released in 1976 (for those of you that might have been asleep all these years). This is, of course Boston's multi-million selling debut. Is it just me or did Boston practically coin the term 'Album Rock'? I was in high school when this timeless piece of '70's rock hit the streets and I do remember partying to this (usually on cassette) a lot. Ever catch 'That '70's Show' when they sat around in the circle? It was a lot like that. Tracks that (I still to this very day) look forward to hearing when I put this CD in for a spin are \\"More Than A Feeling\\", the awesome \\"Peace Of Mind\\", the unbeatable - as well as unmatchable FM radio staple \\"Rock And Roll Band\\", the wailing \\"Smokin'\\" and \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\". Line-up: Tom Scholz - guitar & keyboards, Brad Delp - vocals, Barry Goudreau - guitar, Fran Sheehan - bass and Sib Hashian - drums. So highly recommended, that it almost hurts.
6305897786|5.0|As a fan of demonic movies, I have to say that this is my favorite.  For all you book worms out there, this is probably the only movie that I am aware of where bibliography is at the core of of all the action.  Think of this as a demonic mystery.  I highly recommend this movie.  Very high quality!
6304342160|3.0|The best part of this movie is Joe Pantoliano's performance as an ingratiating, numbingly vicious gangster, convincingly interposing the smarminess with the cruelty.  There are a number of ganagster characters exhibiting horrifyingly graphic viciousness.  Pantoliano's moll is Jennifer Tully, and her lover is Gina Gershon.  Both turn in adequate performances, making this a fairly entertaining movie.  The sex scenes are predictable, and Gershon's performance as a blue collar lesbian who is a pretty good handyman seems a trifle contrived.  The pair scheme to steal 2 million dollars.  Will they get away with it?  Will they betray each other?  The suspense is not exactly nail biting, but on the whole the movie delivers.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|I won't go into the detail of past posters, they have done an excellent job and illuminated many elements not intuitive after the first listen.  However, for all the naysayers telling this gentlemen, who is only doin what he knows how to do, to go home and hang it up.   <br /> <br />1) Listen to Ain't Talking- oh my god, this song will blow your mind it's an epic, jawdropping piece.  You feel not only like this man is walking as said before with his horse by his side, but I get the sense Bob Dylan has become some soothesayer, it is the same persona he dawned in the b-side, \\"Series of Dreams.\\"  Unrelentless flow. <br /> <br />2) Lovesick- just listen to the words and the musicianship!  This is by far one of my favorite Dylan albums as far as music goes and this song proves why.  On iTunes you even get a live video performance which will change your initial reaction to the song. <br /> <br /> <br />I gave you simply 2 reasons and I tell ya, you won't be disappointed. <br />
B0009UC7H0|3.0|I don't mind a bit of Cussler now and again. He writes entertaining if undemanding page-turners, that are perfect fare for a long flight or lounging around on a beach.<br /><br />I was therefore curious to see how this Cussler yarn transferred to the big screen.<br /><br />Well, Sahara is certainly undemanding - the goodies and boo-hiss baddies are all very clearly demarcated early on.  It has to be said though that Matthew McConaughey as our hero Dirk Pitt, bears only a passing resemblance to Cussler's creation.  In the novels, Pitt comes over as far more mature and with a hint of military or secret agent about him.  Let's face it, Pitt is James Bond-lite.  The designer-stubbled, longish haired medallion man that McConaughey gives us, simply didn't feel like Pitt and will probably annoy the Cussler purists no end!<br /><br />No matter! Let's discuss the plot in some detail now. Pitt saves the world from environmental disaster, discovers a hoard of Civil War gold and gets the girl. Errrm ... that's about it!<br /><br />Doesn't sound like much does it?  And yet, the movie still kinda works, if you're in the right frame of mind.  Just go with the flow and you will have to acknowledge that Sahara is beautifully filmed, amidst spectacular landscapes and with expertly selected dynamic camera angles. The high-speed boat pursuit and the action atop the solar tower, although somewhat derivative, were undeniably spectacular.  The improbability of some of the stunts is such that they would make Indiana Jones gulp with disbelief!  What the hell though - this has no pretensions to be oscar material and the 110 minutes flew past in a blur of sumptuous colours, action and amiable camaraderie between McConaughey and his wisecracking sidekick Steve Zahn. Great rocking soundtrack too!  Oh and Ms Cruz is certainly rather decorative!<br /><br />If you don't expect too much, you may well be pleasantly surprised.
B00005A3KS|4.0|ever notice how much the fast and the furious is exactly the same plotline as point break?  yea.  instead of surfers its drivers.  thats kinda why i didnt like the fast and the furious. the stories already been told...and told much better in POINT BREAK.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|although fine on standard TVs, looks pretty bad on high definition TV.  Here's hoping this advertised newly remastered transfer on the 10th Anniversary Limited Edition Collector's Set will be worthy of the newest technology available to watch such a wonderful movie.
B000000WHX|4.0|...I might like it a little better.    There is a good chance you will recognize some of the songs on this disc and not realize it was Massive Attack. I have heard some of the songs on movie soundtracks to commercials.  Blue Lines is what I would call \\"Trip Hop\\".  Trip Hop was more of a result of the 12 inch single boom of the late 80s through the early 90s.  Remixers would extend traditional singles and the Trip Hop genre basically came out of that.  Massive Attack were one of the first to take this as their style.    Here's the problem, I purchased Mezzanine based on some outside reviews I read.  I liked Mezzanine so much I had to get other Massive Attack discs.  I was mildly let down, Blue Lines included.  Its not because Blue Lines is bad, its because Mezzanine is that good.    If Mezzanine is your first Massive Attack disc and are debating whether to purchase others, my suggestion is to listen to the other Massive Attack discs and purchase the songs you like through download.  Blue Lines is a solid effort in Trip Hop.
B00005JP87|5.0|This movie has re-kindled my faith in Hollywood's ability to produce an outstanding film. Beautifully done, romantically perfect.  Cudos to Messrs. Norton, Giamatti and Sewell.  Ms. Biel's portrayal was excellent.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I have listened to this CD for several years now, and I have never tired of it.  I think the best song is Mississippi.  There is something so mellow and soothing about this song, but I can't really put my finger on why.  I think it could be the bluesy base that has such a rhythmic, continuous sound. <br /> <br />Anyway, our entire family (me, my kids, and husband) love Bob Dylan.  My son with special needs has always calmed himself by listening to Dylan albums and used to asked for them by name  \\"I want Diwwan.\\"  There is something magical about this CD that never fails to calm me down, pep me up and feel that the world is a pretty darn great place as long as I can get my hands on this album.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|Of what I can recall of this movie, I thought was pretty good. I'm a big Tom Selleck fan; wish he would and they would bring about a Jesse Stone TV series; it would be great!<br /><br />This movie reminds me of another great TV show--In The Heat of the Night. We TV watchers sure could use another like it and it looks as though Jesse Stone might have what that show had; hey--is anyone reading this? Pay attention!<br /><br />With this movie, Tom Selleck give is a good 'shot in the arm' plus good entertainment; I simply love his acting. And I sure hope in the near future that the other Jesse Stone movies will be released on DVD; I know there are a least 2 others. Can't recall the titles though. Maybe someone out there can help jog my memory.<br /><br />Thanks for the momories, Tom!<br /><br />P.A. Gross
1594481938|2.0|Nick Hornby gives the reader a view of suicide through the thoughts of four distinct characters in A Long Way Down. The reader is presented with a unique writing style that shuffles the narrator of the story through the four protagonists that have all met one new years eve on the roof of Toppers House, a \\"hot spot\\" if you will in London for people to jump and commit suicide.  <br /> <br />I found the book to be fairly repetitive and predictable. The characters would give you a hint of their past, then they would come around again and give you a taste more... and so on and so on. It was quite enjoyable as they developed during the first half of the book but I really lost interest on the back nine. I managed to finish only because I hate leaving a book un-read - you never know if the author has something waiting for you in those last 30 pages. <br /> <br />This was my first Hornby but I plan to give another one or two a shot. <br /> <br />A Long Way Down - 2 stars <br /> <br />Be happy, <br />Matthew Sherman
0062502174|5.0|I received this book 3 years ago from a friend as a gift while I was out of the country.  Since then I have purchased several copies for graduation gifts or just out-of-the-blue gifts.  It is my most favorite book!  I have told several people that if I could only read one book for the rest of my life, it would be 'The Alchemist.'  Coelho has so many pearls of wisdom in this book.  I have read it at least 5 times in only 3 years.  Each time I read it, I see something new or understand something in a different way.  The story is simple, but the way Coelho writes it gives so much meaning!  Everyone should read this book!

B00005A0N5|5.0|Nightwish is one of a handful of metal bands that I listen to. I was fortunate to see the band live before the dismissal of Tarja earlier this year. One of my favorite Nightwish albums is \\"Oceanborn\\", the band's second album. Their first album felt more like a demo than an actual album. Here on \\"Oceanborn\\", the band cleans up on the production. The sound is cleaner but without sounding overly polished. The combination of opera and metal is a match made in heaven. The aggressive guitar riffs compliments Tarja's gorgeous soprano vocals. Neither one overwhelms the other. Every single song on the album is excellent. Not a single dud on this album. \\"Oceanborn\\" is about the perfect symphonic metal album for anyone who wants to check out Nightwish.
B0000CNY27|4.0|**This Review is only for the special edition DVD** <br /> <br />The extras on this DVD are not so good, the extras include: High Definition Film Transfer, the original opening Bank Robbery deleted scene, \\"Return to Escape from New York featurette, and 2 full length audio commentarys. <br /> <br />I think the only REAL extra on this DVD is that it includes a Mini Comic Book titles \\"The Snake Plissken Chronicles and cool packadging. Good DVD if you are a DVD collector or like the movie. Like it ALOT.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I am not going to even pretend that I know alot about this band.  But for months now, I have been listening to this CD play in the background at my work.  A dear friend of mine loves this band more than I can put into words here.  Anyway, I initially dismissed the CD, thinking \\"I am just too old for this stuff\\".  I never really gave it a listen, a GOOD hard listen. <br /> <br />This past week, I finally did just that, gave it the attention it so deserved.  I realized I was NOT too old for beautiful lyrics and I am now obcessed with learning more about AFI.  My only regret is that I was too stubborn to listen to it months ago.

B000063DHK|5.0|The World Slavery Tour, which spanned over the better part of a year, marked the peak of Iron Maiden's live shows.  While they went on to create more elaborate stage sets in their two subsequent tours, the World Slavery Tour clearly marked the height of their cohesiveness as a live band.<br /><br />The discs contain a mixture of shows from Long Beach Arena recorded in 1985, along with 5 songs recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1984 on the European leg of the tour.  The set focuses on the \\"Powerslave\\" album, which they were supporting at the time, and the band is in fine form on the material.  They also play 4 songs off \\"Piece of Mind\\", and it's refreshing to hear Bruce Dickinson actually nail all his notes without much effort.  Ditto with the material off \\"The Number of the Beast\\" (has '22 Acacia Avenue' ever sounded this good?), and a few tracks from \\"Killers\\" and \\"Iron Maiden\\" thrown in for good measure ('Phantom of the Opera' being the clear highlight).<br /><br />As I stated above, the main reason to get this album is to hear how tight Maiden is on the material, and how youthful and enthusiastic they sound.  Martin Birch's producing of this album blows away anything they have done since (Rock in Rio is an improvement, although not as much as you would think, considering it was done about 20 years later).  This is also Dickinson's last great tour, vocal-wise, as he nails  every note that we have come to associate with these great songs.  A little flat in some spots, but awesome overall.  Alas, the constant touring would finally take its toll on Dickinson's pipes, as he would never sound this good again on subsequent tours (anyone who's had a chance to listen to any bootlegs off the \\"Somewhere in Time\\" tour can attest to the fact that Dickinson sounds winded and tired, almost to the point where he speaks his lines in certain songs instead of singing them, and he's only gone downhill from there).<br /><br />The double-CD does not contain a few live tracks that were available on the b-sides of the two singles released in 1985 ('Los'fer Words', which blows away the album version; 'Sanctuary', which they actually encored with on the tour; and an unbelievable version of 'Murders in the Rue Morgue', from Hammersmith in 1984).  One would think that with the extra space available on the second disc, these tracks could have been included.  Unfortunately, the only way to have them is to find copies of the singles, which I fortunately picked up on vinyl when they originally came out (not to date myself here, but.....)<br /><br />In any case, \\"Live After Death\\" is a MUST-OWN in every sense of the word.  I don't think there has ever been a better live recording before or since, and who knows, there may never be......
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I notice that there has not been any additional input on Octavarium in over a year, so I would just like to say that this cd has been in solid rotation rotation for me since I picked it up.  And now with the release of \\"Score\\" this week I'm even more connected to this album.  I can't wait to get a view of the live performance of the title track.  Nothing more to add, just that I can honestly say that this would be a desert island disc for me (although I've decided that my DID list would not be limited to 10)  Ha - Take that list industry!
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna is regarded as one of the most successful female artists of the last 3 decades. She has sold truckloads of records and has gained a loyal fanbase following her every move. For nearly 25 years, Madonna has dazzled the world with her music and her personality, continuously remaking her music and fashion style. In 2005, the pop icon released her 16 studio album Confessions On A Dancefloor to much praise from fans and critics alike. However, The Immaculate Collection is a display of Madonna's musical career approximately from 1983 to 1990, ranging from the festive Holiday to the chic Vogue. The former Material Girl's musical career has often been overshadowed by controversy, nevertheless Madonna has released excellent pop records and made awesome music videos to accompany her various singles.    The vivacious Holiday introduced the world to Madonna, yet her debut single was the bouncy Everybody. Holiday is the embodiment of relaxation and having a good time. The song became an audience favourite as Madonna ventured on various world tours. On her Drowned World Tour, Holiday was the only song from her `'older'' material to be played live, I recalled. The bouncy Lucky Star and Borderline, taken from the self-titled Madonna album, are perhaps viewed as clichéd 1980's pop records, yet they are still able to get people on the dancefloor. Yet it was Like A Virgin which truly made Madonna the talk of the town, the song seemingly instigated massive controversy. It landed Madonna her first number one single in America, spending an amazing six weeks on top. Obviously, Madonna had arrived! The mischievous Material Girl cemented the pop chameleon's success even further. But Madonna displayed a different side of her musical repertoire with the moving Crazy For You, showcasing the sensitive character of the pop star. The energetic Into The Groove does sound dated, yet it certainly has an additive beat and cheerful lyrics. Nevertheless, the lyrics of the song could surely be interpreted allegoric.    Live To Tell marked Madonna's maturity, forcing critics to accept the entertainer as more than pop fluff. Singing of loss and yearning convincingly, Madonna displayed her determination to be more than a bubbly character. The underrated album, True Blue, seemed to showcase Madonna's desire to produce more serious pop records, resulting in Papa Don't Preach, Live To Tell, Open Your Heart and La Isla Bonita. The lingering Like A Prayer is Madonna's musical masterpiece. Surely, it does not come as surprise to many that the Vogue girl's vocal pipes are hardly astonishing, while her musical talent can hardly be described as mind-blowing. Yet Madonna seems to know her strengths and limitations both vocally and musically, the Material Girl does have her moments which Like A Prayer is a testimony of. Express Yourself and Cherish were enormous single hits, showcasing the strength of the Like A Prayer album. The fashionable Vogue made `Vogue-ing' famous and cemented Madonna's popularity among the homosexual crowd. The Immaculate Collection also presented Madonna fans with two new songs: the dark Rescue Me and the Lenny Kravitz-penned Justify My Love. Being no stranger to controversy, Madonna capitalized on the outcries from the public due to her raunchy music video for the steamy Justify My Love.     The Immaculate Collection is a must-have for pop freaks who adore crafted pop records. While some of the songs do have a somewhat dated sound, the album is still worth pulling out of your dusty record collection and having a listen once in a while. Madonna may not be a music genius, but she has surely released some of the finest pop songs within the last 25 years
B00006FR47|3.0|I like this b/c it has \\"dialgoues I and II\\" which are my favorite Chicago songs. The rest of the album is all good but those songs stand out.
B000EQH2QK|2.0|As Shakira released her English album Laundry Service in 2001, the hip-shaking youngster rocketed to international stardom due to the monster hits of Whenever, Wherever, Underneath Your Clothes and Objection (Tango). The perfect fusion of contemporary pop/rock and Latino rhymes proved to be the formula which distinguished Shakira from the average pop star. In 2005, her latest album Oral Fixation Vol. 2 was released to diverse reactions. The record buying public did not seem enthusiastic of the lacklustre single Don't Bother and Oral Fixation Vol. 2 could easily have ended its days in the bargin bin. However, thanks to the re-release of the album which includes the gigantic hit single Hips Don't Lie, Oral Fixation Vol. 2 assured Shakira a successful album. So how good is Oral Fixation Vol.2 really? Is it as good as Hips Don't Lie indicates? Or is it simply a dull affair?    The album opens with the rocky How Do You Do, questioning how someone is able to function despite the harm they have caused. While How Do You Do is appealing, the tune develops into a homogeneous offering. The arrangement seems too weighty and a softer melody would have done wonders for the song. The slightly vague first single Don't Bother did not help generate substantial success for Oral Fixation Vol. 2. In fact, despite its contagious melody, the tune is simply too weak for a first single which main function is to introduce the album to the public. A better choice would perhaps have been Animal Farm which seems more representative of Oral Fixation Vol. 2. Yet the primary setback with Oral Fixation Vol. 2 is the lack of good songs. Besides Hips Don't Lie and La Tortura, there are no instantaneous hits on the album. Indisputably, several of the songs are pleasurable e.g. the susceptible Illegal featuring Santana depicts a fragile Shakira, singing of loss and deceive. It is a tale of a woman having been betrayed by her lover. The Depeche Mode-esque Timor showcases Shakira experimenting with new sounds, while Dreams for Plans reveals a lovely melody which functions quite well with Shakira's poignant voice. Yet despite several enjoyable tunes, the overall impression of Oral Fixation Vol. 2 is a mixed affair. On the whole, the melodies and lyrics are feeble - in other words, they are mediocre at best. Hips Don't Lie is, for myself, the path Shakira should strive towards - the fusion between South America rhymes and modern pop, yet Oral Fixation Vol. 2 seems to pull in a dissimilar direction. I respect artists who wish to experiment with different sounds, yet in this case I don't think Shakira is capable of doing so.     Oral Fixation Vol.2 contains the dazzling Hips Don't Lie and La Tortura which are, undoubtedly, the best tracks on the album. If you buy Oral Fixation Vol.2 in the hope of hearing comparable songs to Hips Don't Lie, you will be severely disappointed. I would advise people, if possible, to listen to the album before purchasing it in order to pass their own judgement and avoiding being disappointed by the result.
B0009R1T7M|2.0|I think that the creativity and uniqueness of these wispy songs (all focused on Illinois issues) overshadows the basic premise of popular music which is that it must be listenable.<br /><br />This is a novelty work rather than a cd you can listen to repeatedly.It is not as good as depicted by the critics. There are some nice melodies, instrumental passages and ideas but this seems more like an experiment rather than a focused work.<br /><br />I respect the taking of chances but this doesn't warrant repeated listenings.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Released in 2001, Greatest Hits Volume 2 established that Madonna's musical career had survived the turbulent nineties. A look at the track list of the album displays an impressive amount of superb pop songs, showcasing that Madonna had been quite productive during the nineties. However, the nineties did not always treat the pop chameleon kindly. The earlier nineties saw the release of her sexbook and her daring album Erotica which caused massive controversy. Madonna's popularity seemed to plummet and as a result her Erotica and Bedtime Stories albums suffered from lower sales than her previous records. Though her 1998 album, Ray Of Light, rocketed Madonna back to the top of the chart, selling over an impressive 14 million copies. Her 2000-release Music cemented that Madonna had no intention of disappearing from the music scene just yet.    Greatest Hits Volume 2 is a collection of Madonna's biggest hits from 1992 to 2000. While some tend to dispute whether Madonna was better during the eighties or the nineties, GHV2 showcases a quantity of Madonna's finest moments in her musical career. From the audacious Erotica to the lingering ballad of Take A Bow, Madonna expresses her bold and sensitive side on the two tunes. The disco-fabulous Deeper And Deeper supposedly deals with homosexuality, while the intrepid Human Nature sees Madonna, attacking her critics `Did I say something wrong?/Oops, I didn't know/I could talk about sex(I must have been crazy)'. The 1994 Bedtime Stories album also saw Madonna tackling a R'n'B-inspired sound with Secret, which works quite well unlike other tracks on the Bedtime Stories. Yet the one of the most enthralling tunes on GHV2 is the murky Bedtime Stories, its sound is quite different from anything else on the Bedtime Stories album. In fact, the song would have been more suitable for Ray Of Light.     Other noteworthy tunes include the poignant The Power Of Goodbye, the mystifying Frozen, the racy Ray Of Light and the haunting Drowned World/Substitute For Love, distinctly displaying that Madonna's 1998 release Ray Of Light is well-represented. While I am not a fan of the song Don't Cry For Me Argentina, Madonna has never sounded better than she does on the Evita soundtrack. The cheerful Beautiful Stranger, taken from the The Spy Who Shagged Me, shows a fun and bubbly Madonna. The Madonna/William Orbit-produced Beautiful Stranger displays the chemistry between the pair at its finest. Despite their excellent collaborations on Ray Of Light, the Music album seems for the most part to suffer from their work together. While I think What If Feels Like For A Girl and Music are among the weaker songs on GHV2, Don't Tell Me is, however, a testimony that Madonna is excellent at incorporating different styles into her music.     GHV2 is a collection of a number of Madonna's greatest songs and would surely be a welcome addition to your pop music collection. Although I think that some songs are missing on the album or should have replaced other, there is little doubt that GHV2 is a superb collection. A minus is, however, that many of the songs are edited versions, which ruins the overall enjoyment of several of the songs. Yet GHV2 is recommendable to everyone who likes the 1990s and Millennium Madonna.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|Let me first off start by saying that I'm obsessed with the Silent Hill game series.  And I'm going to try to write this review as unbiased as I can get for the benefit of those that haven't played the game series. <br /> <br />Silent Hill is a game about atmosphere and art direction.  The plot is there, but no where near as strong as the production.  Which makes it a good film, instead of a great film. <br /> <br />For the game fans, I feel that Christophe Gans has captured Silent Hill to a T.  His vision, is my vision of the town and monsters.  And I hope he's onboard for the visual direction of the sequel if there is one.   <br /> <br />Acting, was done as best as it could be.  I feel that all the main characters, Rose, Sharon, Cybil, Cristabella, and Dahlia, were done wonderfully.  The script wasn't the best, and they did what they could with it.  Rhada played Rose splendidly in my opinion, her fear leaking out of the screen.  Laurie did a great job with cybil, helping the audience feel compassion for her.  Jodelle was a little weak with Sharon, however did a splendid job with Alessa.  For a little girl, I was throughly impressed.   <br /> <br />The creature effects really stand out.  Instead of being purely CG, they took the time and effort to get dancers to do the monsters, and put them in costume.  If you watch the behind the scenes, its really impressive.  And I think a lot of horror movies could learn from this decision.  CGI is not the right choice all the time.  Green screens were used as well, however I feel that Silent Hill is one of the few  movies that pulls off CGI effects and costume effects really well.  Perhaps because its meant to be such a surreal movie, one in which you're supposed to suspend reality, that its not as noticeable. <br /> <br />The plot, as I said, is lacking, but for what its worth I think it generally worked okay.  As an adaption they did what they could.  Anyone who knows the storyline of the first game, knows how complex it is.  And personally, if so  many people were confused with this current plot line, then I suppose they made the best choice in simplifying it.  I feel that its fairly easy to follow, and I think they did a good job of trying to show the different realities and such of the world of Silent Hill.  It sets up what the town's about, which is what Gans was aiming for, since he originally wanted to adapt the second game.  I think he made a good choice of trying to explain the town first, and why it is the way it is.   <br /> <br />As for the special features, there aren't any, really.  Which is dissapointing.  The behind the scenes special is fun, and a great feature, however its the only feature.  During the behind the scenes we can see that there are many scenes that weren't used, and it would've been nice to see these deleted scenes.  It would've also been nice to have some trailers to the movie, some trailers for the video games, and maybe a few fun extras to do with the games.   <br /> <br />But that's what the infamous \\"double dipping\\" is for, right? <br /> <br />In short, if you're a fan of horror, and if you can let the atmosphere and movie wash over you, it should be an enjoyable romp.  Don't sit there, and try to figure things out as the movie's going on.  You really just have to let the movie lead you through, and wrap you up in its world.  Its a gorgeous film, and can be entertaining if you let it.
0312983867|2.0|I read the first 5 series and loved it, 6 and 7 was ok but was getting a little tiring.  Now that I've read 8, I am just going through the motion of finishing out the series (I have a thing about finishing series).   <br /> <br />In the first 5 books, Stephanie's bumbling and misadvantures seemed cute and believable.  But by the 8th book you'd think she would tell her cop boyfriend about people threatening her, notify the proper people for help at the appropriate time, and for christ sake don't go into the house the mob boss tell her not to go into!  I honestly don't blame Morelli for not wanting to marry her, and I don't see what her appeal is to both men like Ranger and Morelli.  This almost reinforces the stereotype that men, even smart men like Morelli and Ranger, likes ditzy bimbos.   <br /> <br />I have never seen anyone so stupid and so lacking of survival skills.  You'd think after all the death threats and close calls she's had in the first 7 books, Stephanie would carry her gun and not leave it at the cookie jar.  If she hates guns so much, quit being a bounty hunter.  I find myself screaming in the book \\"move you dummy\\", this has gotten irritating and annoying to read.   <br /> <br />And the love triangle between her and Morelli and Ranger is just unbelievable.  Why would they men want her?  She's a mess and she lacks any real charm that I can see.  She hides secrets from them and I find the way she lusts after one guy soon after the other leaves the room to be dispicable.  If she loves Morelli so bad she should quit all the kissing and petting (oh and having sex) with Ranger.  When Morelli doesn't give her the time of the day because they broke up she goes all pouty and make it sound like it's Morelli's fault.  Hello!  If Morelli found out she had sex with Ranger she'd never see him again.
0553213105|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It took me a while to read it, about 2 months, because it's definitely not fast paced.  I was glad I had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand.<br /><br />Mr. Darcy is \\"pride\\" and Elizabeth Bennett is \\"prejudice\\".  These two are made for each other, unbeknown to themselves.  This is essentially the story of how they fall in love, with lots of twists and turns.<br /><br />I really like Mr. Darcy.  He is the perfect gentleman.  He is readily willing to admit his own faults, when they are brought to his knowledge.  He also doesn't retaliate when rejected by Elizabeth and accused of things he didn't do or that are misunderstood.<br /><br />Elizabeth is also wonderful.  She is doubtful about people and quite cynical.  I really like that about her.  It makes for some great banter between Darcy and herself.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is when Elizabeth see Darcy at Pemberly.  This is where I think she begins to fall in love with him.  Pemberly is where he is at home- where is is truly himself.  I would probably be charmed by him too!<br /><br />This book took a little commitment to get through, but once I got into it, I couldn't wait to see what happened next, even though I already knew the story.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Regency England.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|I've read a few reviews here where the mastering on this is actually praised. This is the absolute worst case of Sonic Solutions No-Noise sucking the life out of every instrument I've ever heard. Completely ridiculous. There is no dimension or space left. It all sounds completely unrealistic. I hope whoever butchered these recordings is not allowed anywhere near any future Beatle releases.
0743518136|5.0|I probably say you should read thoroughly all books you chose to undertake.  What can I say, Input is one of my signature themes!  If you take the profile test and read the book closely (and take it seriously) you will find out a lot about yourself.  This opened some doors for me.  Since I read it, I have searched out more evaluation tools like this.  I'm finding a lot of consistencies and now, as a result, I am making some positive changes in my life. <br /> <br />I used to wonder how Tiger Woods got so good at golf.  Now I know how.  His strengths are consistent with what he does.  He had a good coach who he believed in, and he practices his strengths daily.  This adds up to him being the best golfer the game has seen. <br /> <br />This model holds true to all people I know who are great at something.  They have been wired to perform certain activities and they are practicing them on a daily basis to achieve excellence.  You must figure out your strengths and pursue a course of action which enables you to use these strengths.

B000ETQRCM|4.0|Pearl Jam finds the guys going for a more mainstream sound this time. You can expect a few things! One will be some radio-friendly songs, a renewed spark, and less experimentation.  All of these things apply to the new Pearl Jam. Overall this album is more consistent than their last few outings. Technically this would be their best in 10 years, although I like it about as much as Binaural. It starts out with the Who-like Life Wasted and continues to rock for a few more songs. WWO is a typical Pearl Jam rocker and Comatose is a rehash of Spin the Black Circle but not as good. Unemployable is probably the best song I heard from these guys in a while and Eddie actually sounds pretty good.  Big Wave reminds me of Soundgarden. Come Back would have been done better by Rod Stewart but they perform this song pretty well. There are a few so-so songs like Gone which fails to find a suitable chorus. Severed hand sounds muddled and forced and Comatose is also a forced remake of earlier punkish material. Life Wasted reprise is simply filler. Musically they sound energized and raw but proficient. However, Eddie still sounds as if he has marbles in his mouth and he strains to hit many of the notes. This can be irritating to listen to sometimes and it has been going on since Yield. At least he sounds like he is putting forth the effort as opposed to Riot Act which he sounded at times awful.  Parachutes, Unemployable and Come Back are some expectionally good vocal performances by Eddie. He sounds good on Marker in the Sand. It is clear they are the new Who. They sound more and more like the Who with each record.  Overall this is a good effort and it stands on its own without the need of useless hype and commercialism.  Eddie needs to take some throat drops and rest his voice and not tour as much. If this doesn't happen it will be time to consider more vocal duties to Stone Gossard. He may lack the range of eddie but the words can be made out with Stone on vocals.
B000GPI15K|5.0|I've played this CD at least once a day since the day it was released. At l e a s t once. The first time I was slightly surprised because this album is different from Patricia Barber's other works, but the surprise was far from being unpleasant.  <br />'Mythologies' is very original, and varies greatly in musical styles. There's not a song on this album that I'd consider bad, or even mediocre. They're all brilliant. Great lyrics - very poetic and thoughtful in places -, and great music. The best album I've listened to in ages. Too bad I can't give it 10 stars. <br />Get it!
B000GCFO0I|1.0|This has to be the worst, most boring horror film I have seen in years. I did manage to watch over an hour of it before shutting it off. Don't bother with this, if you want to see a few good horror flicks check out The Devil's Rejects or The Hills Have Eyes.
B000AWYOGE|2.0|Perhaps horror movies should return to the gothic countryside fixer-upper.  \\"The Ring\\" and \\"The Grudge\\" took place in a city setting, and managed to eek out a chill or two.  However, this movie fails to break any new territory.  Worse, the plodding pace just failed to keep me interested to the end.<br /><br />Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is in the midst of a bitter divorce with husband Kyle (Dougray Scott).  Caught in the middle is daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade).  Dahlia insists on moving into a building where weird things are constantly happening.  The excitement builds and builds (a little tongue-in-cheek here) as the movie moves between events caused by people and events caused by something that the movie only reveals at the end.  Thrown into this plot goulash is Dahlia's childhood.  Dahlia's mother abandoned her.  We see periodic flashbacks to help us understand Dahlia's actions.<br /><br />There are a bunch of problems with this movie.  First, too much stuff is going on which means absolutely nothing.  The guy in the elevator meant nothing and he failed to advance the plot.  Yes, he did provide information about the elevator going up to the tenth floor and he did note that someone kept obliterating the writing on the elevator buttons.  Big deal; we already knew that information when he showed up.<br /><br />The teenage boys appeared menacing, but the movie wastes yet another opportunity.  I could go on, but I would spoil the whole movie for you, in the event that you decide to watch this snoozer.<br /><br />The movie did finally wake from its slumber and provide us with a few tense, generally predictable, moments.  However, those few moments were insufficient compensation for the nearly hour and a half wait.  Incidentally, my wife predicted the end of the movie about halfway through it, beating me completely.  After she pointed out the probable ending, I suddenly realized that this movie was terribly obvious the whole time.  Of course, my wife already realized that.<br /><br />I watched the \\"unrated widescreen edition,\\" which was supposed to be scarier than what was shown in the theaters.  If this movie was scarier, I think many people must have felt that they wanted their money back when they saw this one in the theater.<br /><br />\\"Dark Water\\" fails to slake my thirst for a good horror movie.  I think I would rather watch \\"The Ring\\" or \\"The Grudge\\" again rather than this movie.  If you want to see a real horror in your own home, go look at the dirty dishwater; yes, this movie was that dull.reen edition,\\" which was supposed to be scarier than what was shown in the theaters.

B000BL39G0|4.0|Before I start my review, let me you know something. I'm not one of those people who prases Tupac like he's some kind of god or something. I understand he was highly talented and everything, but to me he was just another emcee, just like everyone else. Also I don't put him into comparison with people like Malcom X and Dr. Martin Luther King, because those people are in a whole another league than Tupac Shakur was. I know that sounds a little ignorant, because I don't believe whatever you want me to believe in, but that is how I see him, a highly talented emcee, and thats it. For you people who can't accept the fact on the comment I just made and cannot accept my rating, just click the \\"No\\" button at the bottom and save yourself some time.<br /><br />*You can take the previous statement however you want*<br /><br />Anyway here is my review:<br /><br />Pac was a big name back in 1996. Everybody knew who he was, and what he was all about. Around that time, he was also facing some huge problems, aside from the beef with Notorious BIG. When he got into the studio, recorded and released \\"All Eyez On Me\\" that became a huge multi-platnum selling album. I didn't get a chance to hear this until about 5 years ago, and hearing this album was so refreshing to my ears.<br /><br />Disc One was more of the commercial side of Pac. Most of his songs were shooting for mainstream status, with well success. The biggest Pac hit he had was \\"California Love\\" with Dr. Dre. (still sampling Roger Toutman) Now the album has the remix with a more relaxed west coast style beat, than the one many people are familiar with (even though there was a video for both songs). Aside from that, one of my favorite joints is \\"How Do You Want It\\" with Jodeci. The disc will also contain most of his other hit songs from the album: \\"It's All About U\\", \\"I Ain't Mad At Cha\\" (a different version with the same beat is on the video), and \\"2 Of Amerika's Most Wanted\\". Some of the guests would shine on here also. The Dogg Pound and Redman and Method Man would join in for the song \\"I Got My Mind Made Up\\". Speaking of Method Man, parts of his song \\"Bring The Pain\\" would be the hook for Pac's song \\"Bring The Pain\\" with more of a gangstafied feel.<br /><br />Disc Two had a little gangstafied style to the album. A highlight would be the song \\"Wonder Why They Call U B***h\\" dedicated to many women who go around hanging out with guys for sexual activities. It feels like Pac switched styles when he hit the second disc on this album, because this mood is more different than the first disc. Another song that I like is \\"Check Out Time\\", as well as the gangsta love type track \\"Run The Streets\\". Production is pretty straight. Guest appearances are okay on this disc. Kurupt and everyone who appears on \\"It Ain't Hard 2 Find\\" with E-40 and more are pretty dope. Some of the no names on this album like Big Syke aren't as good (listen to \\"All Eyez On Me\\" title track for instance). Other than that, it's okay.<br /><br />So this is very unfortunate. Pac wasn't around long enough to see his album sell 9+ million copies. I enjoyed both discs, and I'll pop em in every once in a while when I want to hear some rhymes with a gangsta feel behind it. I'm pretty sure every Pac fan has snatched this up. If you don't have this, I recommend that you get it also.

B00006L9ZT|5.0|Most of the reviewers of this DVD set of Wagner's \\"Ring\\" are seasoned Wagnerites.  Thus we get some quibbling about this or that stage effect, high or low note, and the like.  I'm writing as a Wagner neophyte.<br /><br />The lasting impression these DVDs made on me was that the only way to learn to appreciate Wagner is to actually visualize his operas in a dramatic performance. One can then turn to the CD versions with a proper sense of the music. This may sound so obvious as to be simple-minded.  Yet there is a difference between Wagner's \\"musical dramas\\" and such works as Madame Butterfly, Carmen,, etc.  One can listen to the latter and learn to enjoy the musical arias without ever seeing the operas performed.  This is not true with Wagner. His operas do not contain arias - grand songs that are set pieces separated by recitative.<br /><br />Since live performances of The Ring are scarce and actually non-existent where I live this DVD set is invaluable.  I've listened to CDs of The Ring while reading the libretto, read interpretive books, and listened to CDs expounding the meaning of the leitmotifs. Yet the full impact and meaning of the Cycle was not comprehended until watching these DVDs.<br /><br />Having praised Levine's DVD production so highly I must make one quibble.  Although I'm relatively new to Wagner, I'm not new to classical music or opera in general.  To my eyes and ears Hildegard Behrens as Brunnhilde is the only flaw of note in this production.  I get the feeling that she is past her prime and although she gives it a mighty effort the power and the drama are just not there.  But this is not enough of a quibble to deduct a star.

Some of the no names on this album like Big Syke aren't as good (listen to \\"All Eyez On Me\\" title track for instance). Other than that, it's okay.    So this is very unfortunate. Pac wasn't around long enough to see his album sell 9+ million copies. I enjoyed both discs, and I'll pop em in every once in a while when I want to hear some rhymes with a gangsta feel behind it. I'm pretty sure every Pac fan has snatched this up. If you don't have this, I recommend that you get it also. Also check out \\"Me Against The World\\", because I like that one better than this one here.      Tupac Shakur...Rest In Peace...

0393324818|5.0|When I was growing up I devoured any book written about baseball.  As I've gotten older, my passion for the game has waned.  Though still a fan, I'd not read a baseball book in several years until I finally got around to reading this one. <br /> <br />Reading Moneyball four years after the events occured sheds new light on things.  The first portion of the book focuses on the personality and playing history of general manager Billy Beane and then has an inside look at the 2002 amateur draft, where many of Beane's philosophies are put into action.  Beane is ecstatic when Scott Kazmir and Prince Fielder are selected by other teams thus allowing him to get the player he covets, Nick Swisher.  Swisher has panned out nicely for the A's.  Jeremy Brown, the other draftee Lewis focuses on, has not had the success anticipated (he had his first big league at bat just last night).   <br /> <br />The rest of the book has some interesting moments as well.  There is a lengthy discussion of sabrmetrics and the role Bill James and others have played in shaping the A's philosophy.  Also, a couple of really interesting profiles of Scott Hatteberg and Chad Bradford which shed some light on the strange paths some people take on their way to major league baseball.   <br /> <br />Lewis focuses a lot of attention on Paul DePodesta, the assistant GM for the A's.  In fact, without saying so directly, I get the impression that Lewis feels he's at least equally responsible for the A's successes.  DePodesta has since gone on to an unsuccessful sting with the Los Angeles Dodgers. <br /> <br />Reading the book a few years after the fact gives some perspective on some of the mistakes that Beane and the A's have made with some player decisions, but despite those mistakes, the bottom line is that the franchise has continued to excel despite being dramatically outspent and despite the fact that the rest of baseball has been \\"clued in\\" to the A's thinking.   <br /> <br />As an aside...I find it interesting that all of the attention has been paid to Beane and the A's.  This is well deserved, for sure, but lost in all of this is the fact that the Minnesota Twins have been equally frugal and nearly equally successful.  How have THEY done it?  It might make for an interesting book itself. <br /> <br />Any true baseball fan, even a somewhat lapsed baseball fan such as myself, should do him/herself a favor and pick up this book.  It may even rekindle some interest in the game we grew up loving...
B00005AQE8|4.0|Before I start my review, let me you know something. I'm not one of those people who prases Tupac like he's some kind of god or something. I understand he was highly talented and everything, but to me he was just another emcee, just like everyone else. Also I don't put him into comparison with people like Malcom X and Dr. Martin Luther King, because those people are in a whole another league than Tupac Shakur was. I know that sounds a little ignorant, because I don't believe whatever you want me to believe in, but that is how I see him, a highly talented emcee, and thats it. For you people who can't accept the fact on the comment I just made and cannot accept my rating, just click the \\"No\\" button at the bottom and save yourself some time.<br /><br />*You can take the previous statement however you want*<br /><br />Anyway here is my review:<br /><br />Pac was a big name back in 1996. Everybody knew who he was, and what he was all about. Around that time, he was also facing some huge problems, aside from the beef with Notorious BIG. When he got into the studio, recorded and released \\"All Eyez On Me\\" that became a huge multi-platnum selling album. I didn't get a chance to hear this until about 5 years ago, and hearing this album was so refreshing to my ears.<br /><br />Disc One was more of the commercial side of Pac. Most of his songs were shooting for mainstream status, with well success. The biggest Pac hit he had was \\"California Love\\" with Dr. Dre. (still sampling Roger Toutman) Now the album has the remix with a more relaxed west coast style beat, than the one many people are familiar with (even though there was a video for both songs). Aside from that, one of my favorite joints is \\"How Do You Want It\\" with Jodeci. The disc will also contain most of his other hit songs from the album: \\"It's All About U\\", \\"I Ain't Mad At Cha\\" (a different version with the same beat is on the video), and \\"2 Of Amerika's Most Wanted\\". Some of the guests would shine on here also. The Dogg Pound and Redman and Method Man would join in for the song \\"I Got My Mind Made Up\\". Speaking of Method Man, parts of his song \\"Bring The Pain\\" would be the hook for Pac's song \\"Bring The Pain\\" with more of a gangstafied feel.<br /><br />Disc Two had a little gangstafied style to the album. A highlight would be the song \\"Wonder Why They Call U B***h\\" dedicated to many women who go around hanging out with guys for sexual activities. It feels like Pac switched styles when he hit the second disc on this album, because this mood is more different than the first disc. Another song that I like is \\"Check Out Time\\", as well as the gangsta love type track \\"Run The Streets\\". Production is pretty straight. Guest appearances are okay on this disc. Kurupt and everyone who appears on \\"It Ain't Hard 2 Find\\" with E-40 and more are pretty dope. Some of the no names on this album like Big Syke aren't as good (listen to \\"All Eyez On Me\\" title track for instance). Other than that, it's okay.<br /><br />So this is very unfortunate.

0375701427|4.0|I just finished reading American Pastoral, my first book by Philip Roth. Since it is my first Roth, I think I provide an unbiased perspective. I know he has written some other stuff, but my mind has not yet been corrupted by it. OK, so what is my opinion of American Pastoral? <br /> <br />For starters, I think the style is a lot like that of Joseph Conrad in Lord Jim (the only Conrad I have read). There are pages  upon pages of diversions from the main plot; lengthy descriptions of people sitting around at dinner tables; single events that are analyzed and re-analyzed from every possible angle, and then re-analyzed again. This type of literature is often fascinating but can quickly become tiresome, so I am not surprised that some of the Amazon reviewers were not able to finish the book. As far as readability is concerned, this book gets a B+. Delicious in places, starchy in others. <br /> <br />Now, what about the main point that Roth is trying to make?  <br /> <br />He wants to tell us something fundamental about the All-American Man. He wants us to re-think our concept of the Successful American. He wants us to examine the American Dream closely and see what lies beneath its surface. He wants us to look behind the facade of beauty pageants and country clubs and face lifts and Little League and white teeth and football and big muscles and all that other good stuff we cherish about America. <br /> <br />In this book, Roth tries to lift the veil and show us the real America. <br /> <br />Is he successful? <br /> <br />Sort of. For example, the fetid mess that propels All-American Swede toward insanity is masterfully portrayed. The mental breakdown of our All-American Hero is wonderfully choreographed. The Hero's slow descent into hell is captured page by page in exquisite detail. <br /> <br />However, depsite all this terrific stuff, I came away with the odd notion that Roth himself may be slightly out of touch. This book is clearly written from the perspective of anolder generation. The younger generation is seen as infantile, petulant, irksome, depraved, and so forth. Adolesence, to Roth, apparently has few redeeming features. Youth exists simply to torment the elderly, the Establishment. Roth, and his cast of bittersweet characters, are sadly on the wrong side of the hill. I don't want to say that Roth comes off looking like a grumpy old man. So I won't say it. I'll just think it. <br /> <br />Lesson I learned from reading this book: if you are lucky enough to get a chance to live the American Dream, live it by all means! Enjoy! But, if you do decide you want to live the American Dream,  go in with your eyes wide open. The American Dream is more complicated than it looks! <br /> <br />Read the book if you have already lived your American Dream and you want to compare notes with somebody else who has been there, done that, too.  <br /> <br />Pass on this book if you are youthful, optimistic, and your Dream is still alive. You can always read this book afterward, once things settle comfortably down and you want to reflect on what it all meant.
B000GFLKF8|2.0|Judging from the reviews below, you would think this movie was on the verge of something great. WRONG.    IMO The storyline was very weak. I will give you a few examples.    The movie introduces too much information. For example, Frasier's girlfriend's brother (Notice how I don't know his name). He's introduced to the movie in the first 10 minutes as a person who is always in trouble with the law and shares an apartment with Frasier and his girlfriend. The next time you see or hear about this character is near the end - he's sleeping on the couch.    The next horrible character was Jodie Foster. She is introduced as a \\"problem solver for hire.\\" However, her role is useless because when she confronts the bank robbeer she doesn't solve the problem. She is sprinkled throughout the rest of the movie for no reason at all.    In the movie, the robbers take everyones cell phone. One of the hostage has his kid with him. The kid offers to put his PSP into the bag. The robber, who seems fond of the kid, tells him to keep it. Considering the the PSP has wireless access one would assume this decision will come back to bite the bad guy the end. It's called FORESHADOWING. Instead, the PSP is shown as a device which has violent games on it that can influence our kids. Good message, but it was a wasted message.    Finally, it was not clear why the bank robber was robbing the bank. It was not clear how he knew which safe deposit box to steal. It was not clear why the bank robber wanted to expose the head of the bank as an evil person. It was not clear if the robbery was personal or if it was random.    Overall, the movie did not build up it's characters. The characters are flat. There is no growth. If you are a movie buff, this movie you can afford to miss.
1400034779|4.0|I'm not a typical mystery novel fan- most of them seem to be about elaborate, overly complex and unrealistic murder cases, where the whole point of the novel is for us readers to find out 'who dun it?'  Characterization, settings, and mood suffer as the author is almost entirely focused on setting up a complex web of events and 'clues' that aim to shock the reader at the end.<br /><br />So I was happy that THE NO.1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY was not your typical detective story.  Mma Ramotswe does not spend the whole book figuring out a series of elaborate murders, rather, she spends her time searching for a missing husband in a river, tracking a rebellious teen-age daughter, returning a stolen Mercedes Benz, exposing con-artist doctors, and investigating a young boy kidnapped by witch-doctors.<br /><br />Unlike traditional detective fiction, where we know little about the detective's life apart from his or her work, we get  extraordinary insight into Mma Ramotswe's life.  We meet her as a child with a gift for drawing, then follow her tragic marriage to an abusive man and feel her grief at loosing her child.  We watch as she fulfills her dear father's wishes in opening a business- although he didn't expect her to be the first lady detective in Botswana- maybe Africa!  All these events have shaped Mma Ramotswe into a strong, feisty, proud but compassionate woman who loves Africa, drinks bush tea, drives a 'little white van' and wears size 22 clothing.<br /><br />The novel also highlights life in Africa.  Hilarious passages highlight issues such as gender relations (African men 'carry on with ladies' and don't want to change 'babies nappies'), respect for elders (Mma Ramotswe is miffed by an 'upstart' 19 year old who treats her like a child) and the importance of a leading balanced life (Mma Ramotswe feels sorry for white people who are 'always dashing around' and never realize the valuable things in life such as watching your cattle eat grass).  We also learn about the land of Botswana, including the desolate Kalahari plains with thorn bushes and cattle, dusty roads with deadly cobras, and rain-swollen rivers with man-eating crocodiles.<br /><br />Thus, while I agree with Bjorn Torrissen (review August 19, 2006) that the actual detective cases were rather simple- (I did figure out some of them before Mma Ramotswe did), there is so much more to this book than detective fiction.  While the cases do not necessarily 'shock' due to their cleverness, they succeed brilliantly, along with details of Mma Ramotswe's life, in showing the spirit of a modern African woman and her beloved country of Botswana.including the desolate Kalahari plains with thorn bushes and cattle, dusty roads with deadly cobras, and rain-swollen rivers with man-eating crocodiles.

B000005HN6|5.0|Opeth took me completely by surprise back in 1995. I'd been hunting for black metal bands and pretty much anything violent and dark at the time. I therefore purchased a Candlelight compilation CD and two of the tracks on there were by a band called Opeth whom I'd never heard of. They didn't fit the description of what I'd been searching for and yet a couple of spins later and I would be thoroughly convinced that these Swedes were something very special indeed. <br /> <br />The first word that comes to mind on listening to their music is class. Whereas so many bands around are trying to be as fast as they can, or as desolate as they can, or as evil as they can, Opeth just try to write damn good music. As far as I'm concerned they've never failed to do that in the 12 plus years of their existence. It helps that each member of the band is extremely talented, but talent doesn't always equal quality music, which is abundantly present in everything they touch, including this debut album. <br /> <br />Not many metal bands would run with the idea of calling their debut album \\"Orchid\\" and displaying a pink flower on the cover. But that's a sign of the intellectual qualities of the band. They don't get caught up in all the seemingly necessary nasty image portrayals that so many other bands use to catch your attention. The cover is perfect in that it presents a depiction of the beauty held within its content and it's memorable in its uniqueness. <br /> <br />There are five epic tracks here with a length of 10 or more minutes each and two short instrumentals to keep the listener occupied. Normally when albums contain tracks of such extended lengths, you can assume each one contains a certain degree of repetition. But that's not the case here. Each track contains a wealth of variety, generally not holding to constant themes and instead, branching out in many directions of differing moods and texture. Which is one of the things that differentiates the first two Opeth albums to the rest of their work. While later releases do contain songs that are easily recognisable due to constant themes running through the underbelly of experimentation and musical adventure, both \\"Orchid\\" and \\"Morningrise\\" tend to move from one gripping section to another, never really inhabiting the one place for too long. One minute it's beautiful acoustic, next it's crushing death metal, then doom-filled harmonies and so on. I see this as both a positive (each section is both fresh and captivating) and a negative (it's difficult to hear part of a song and actually know which one it belongs to due to this lack of focus). <br /> <br />This is not Opeth's best album, but it's excellent nonetheless. If you're into extreme metal (melodic and progressive death metal in particular), then this band are the holy grail. \\"Orchid\\" is the first of many masterpieces and an album I can go back to over and over again and still be filled with admiration and wonder.
B000002J03|3.0|Led Zep II is an innovative studio album with Page & Jones at the top of their studio wizardry. The album kicks off with the famous redundant Whole Lotta Love riff and continues through the over indulgent psycedelic bridge one is truly glad when this song ends. What is & What Should Never Be is definitely the album highlight with Zep firing on all cylinders. The bluesy Lemon Song and the poppy Thank You follows. The old war horse combo Heartbreaker/Living Loving Maid keep the album rocking and Page seems like he has riffs to burn. From here the album cools off with Plant's Hobbit influenced wispy Ramble On. the lame space filler Moby Dick instumental follows. The album closes with another highlight \\"Bring it On Home\\" a rockin blues tribute. Although Zep's creativity showed this album the music sounds lifted like a Lenny Kravitz album.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|The more I listen to this CD, the more I want to. Musically, it's superb, and lyrically it's even better. Dylan's sense of humor shines through constantly, even in the darkest songs. If I couldn't understand a word of English, I'd still want to hear this album again and again. There's very little about it that's not catchy, and catchy isn't an adjective you often hear connected to Dylan.
B000EMGJM2|5.0|This is the first VanHunt album I've owned.  This is a wonderful CD, I like most every song.  Even Daredevil, which I used to skip is growing on me.  But you have to have an open mind with this one because each song has its own style.  Its got a lot of guitar.  Its got a couple of 80s sounding songs.  It has some pretty good lyrics.  But I like it, 80s-sounding-guitar-good-lyrics and all.  I always go back to this CD, its been in the trunk ever since I bought it a couple of months ago. <br /> <br />Open minded \\"alternative r&b neo soul heads\\" this one is for you.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Why doesn't she love me anymore? Why can't I stop thinking about her? Why did she say she loved me in the first place? I just don't understand. I keep listening to this album because I think somewhere there's got to be an answer. There's got to be a reason, you know? Things don't just change like that without a reason. I just want to talk to her.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|At first listen, anyone older than 25 can instantly see the 'influences' on this music and hearken back to the heavy times. Those who aren't will probably see them as a Soundgarden derivative. This band is not trying to reinvent sounds, just arrange them in a smoking format. However, after having my faux rock critic moment, I put this one away for a week, then popped it into my car. Holy sh%#balls. Great album. Heavy, rocking, tight riffs, soaring vocals, no loose ends. Like it's 'co-seller' broken boy soldiers, a 'hats off' to 70's power rock, but with more solid tracks. Unified sound. Although some times it's SO perfect, that you have to wonder if you have a master producer going over tab/timing from 70s bands to make it so 'genuinely vintage'. Either way, pop on your sennheisers, sit back and enjoy...
B00005JP87|5.0|Neil Burger does an outstanding job in writing and directing an engrossing, moody period piece taking place in turn of the 20th century Vienna.  The movie is filmed in the picturesque baroque settings of the Czech Republic.<br /><br />Edward Norton, a talented young actor who has compiled an impressive resume of excellent cinematic performances plays Eisenheim a highly skillful illusionist.  The lowly son of a cabinetmaker Norton was the childhood sweetheart of the aristocratic Duchess Sophie.  He was banished to quash this tabooed relationship.<br /><br />Fifteen years later he triumphantly returns to Vienna as a well respected magician.  His talents come to the attention of Chief Inspector Uhl played by the terrific Paul Giamatti in a role that might finally garner him a well deserved Oscar.  Uhl, himself an amateur magician is checking Norton out in anticipation of the attendance of Crown Prince Leopold to a performance.  The sinister and truculent crown prince played nicely by Rufus Sewell is ironically betrothed to Norton's old flame Sophie.<br /><br />When Norton and Sophie played by Jessica Biel reunite the sparks again begin to fly and they resume a relationship.  Giamatti, under the influence of the crown prince, has been following Sophie and reports back to him of their affair.<br /><br />Sewell in a murderous, jealous rage manhandles Biel and she is found the next day in the woods dead, a result of blood loss from a sword slash.  Leopold is implicated but Giamatti throws another man in jail for the crime, even though he has suspicions about the crown prince.<br /><br />Eisenheim is convinced that Leopold killed his beloved Sophie and changes his act and now begins to bring spirits back from the dead.  Everything seems cut and dry but is all as it seems?<br /><br />Overall the film is certainly one of the best to come along this season.  It concludes with a twist almost of the magnitude of the incredibly great \\"The Usual Suspects\\".
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Yes, the typical right-wing advocates will smile as they criticize another movie portraying the future controlled by a 1984 psuedo-democracy.  However, left or right, the movie entertains with numerous references to the \\"war on terror\\" and despite the violence most of the questions and concerns are unfortunately valid.  Do not be afraid of the similarities.  Instead, like some of the scenes in the movie, start asking questions of the politicians and self-promoters on both sides.
B00000K0DQ|4.0|Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) is working to improve the lives of the poor in New Orleans.  She receives a request to visit a prisoner on death row.  Her compassionate  nature makes her visit the man. <br /> <br />When she meets Matthew Poncellete (Sean Penn), he is a humble man who is desperate to have some one help him out.  But the man she met is not the man who committed the crimes or is his humility just an act?  Through the movie she finds out it's a little of both. <br /> <br />When she attends an appeal hearing, she meets the parents of the two kids he killed and realizes that there are two sides to every story.  These parents are still feeling the pain and cannot understand why she is giving the killer any sympathy.  She realizes that to understand Matthew, she needs to understand the crime.  She meets with both sets of parents to understand their pain.  These are very effective scenes. <br /> <br />In the end, Matthew comes to term with his fate and Sister brings him together with his family. <br /> <br />Tim Robbins once again proves that he knows how to direct a film.  This film is definitely an actors' film.  His wife Sarandon wins an Oscar for her textured performance. Sean Penn finally starts to show what he is capable of and receives his first Oscar nomination.  But it is Robbins' casting of the supporting players that makes the film great.  Stage star Roberta Maxwell is compelling as Poncellete's mother.  While Celia Weston was best know for her TV role on Alice, proves that she can manipulate an audience as on the victim's mother.  And look for Jack Black in a very subdued performance - it would be nice if he repeated this more often. <br /> <br />This is definitely an anti-death penalty film but it does show that there are two points of view to every controversy. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: <br />Commentary by Tim Robbins <br />
B0000C9JFO|5.0|Anyone who's ever been on an Erasmus semester and lived with a mix of people from other countries will most likely love this movie! Most everything about it reminded me of my semester abroad! That said, I'm assuming that the bad reviews were due to people who couldn't relate to the movie on this level!
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I am thoroughly pleased with this CD.  When I heard the first track I thought I was listening to Erykah Badu for a second. Corinne has a beautiful voice. I recommend buying it.
B000GRUMPU|3.0|I remember liking the 1972 version very much, but it's been too long since I saw it for me to compare this remake with it. However, this movie is mostly a standard action movie. It has spectacular special effects and provides 100 minutes of entertainment, but it's not going to give a lasting impression. The characters are all forgettable and I never really felt like I cared much about them. Who can forget Shelley Winters or Gene Hackman from the original version? I doubt if by next week I'll remember Kurt Russell or whatshername's performance in this one.  <br /> <br />\\"Poseidon\\" may be worth renting but it's not a film you need to have in your collection.
B000G03Q2S|3.0|Pet Sounds is one of my favorite albums, so the three stars I gave for this review is more of an indication of how I feel about this anniversary release.  <br /> <br />While this release will be great for those who never owned Pet Sounds, or only owned the standard CD, the DVD-Audio release of this album from a couple years ago had a much better surround sound mix. The dolby 5.1 mix on this anniversary disc is awful compared to the DVD-A. At the very least it should have been a DTS surround mix. <br /> <br />But, for those who want a great album in unique packaging, then this is for you. But if you do have a DVD-Audio capable player, go for the DVD-A release instead.
B000BYA5G4|2.0|This is a very slow movie and it seems more like a documental about war, geopolitics and weapons trade. There is almost no dialogues.
1592401791|4.0|Finally, a new Beatles book that has some NEW RELIABLE information. The author does a great job of bringing us into the recording studio with the Beatles while they recorded their masterpieces and outtakes. I am grateful for the author sharing these experiences and will put this book in a prominent place in my Beatles library.
0688170528|5.0|I've read \\"My Sister's Keeper,\\" \\"The Tenth Circle,\\" and \\"Mercy,\\" but \\"The Pact\\" is definitely the best of them all.  Great read.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|A flawless performance.  Hearing their compositions with an orchestra was truly gratifying.  It demonstrates just how intricate their music is.
B000001ELL|4.0|When it comes to my favorite bands that have been around a long time and have been through different trends and styles, I seem to gravitate to the eras that most fans do not like.  I like it when bands experiment and try out fresh sounds or directions that may seem out-of-character.  Such is the case with KISS.  I really like their late 1970s-early 1980s material like Music From the Elder, Creatures of the Night and, to a lesser extent, Unmasked which most fans tend to shun.  I also think Dynasty is awesome!  The glamour KISS style I think really worked from their cool costumes to the great tracks like \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\" and \\"Sure Know Something.\\"  Yeah, disco was on its way out when this album was released in 1979.  It was not going to be a style KISS would continue for years to come but, for this album, I think it worked.  I'm not crazy about every track on Dynasty but, the ones that are the most glam and fresh, I love! <br /> <br />\\"I Was Made for Loving You\\":  The most recognizable track on this album.  The title makes it sound a bit cliché'd and cheesy but, in actuality, it has a very fresh sound for KISS.  It is the most danceable and disco-sounding track on the album and I think they did an excellent job adopting that style.  Old school fans may have cried \\"sell out\\" at the time, but the song is just darn good, very accessible and addicting. <br />\\"2,000 Man\\":  Ace Frehley's Rolling Stone cover.  A fun track I really like, but it does drag.  It is 4:43 and seems even longer because it plods along and is repetitive.  I'd enjoy it more if it was shorter; but I know this is probably a Dynasty fan favorite. <br />\\"Sure Know Something\\":  More glam KISS.  A promotional video was made for this track along with \\"I Was Made...\\"  It has a groovy opening bass line and just makes you want to get your groove on.  I love the bass riff before each line of the chorus.  It is very catchy.  Lyrically-wise, however, it is rather juvenile which is unfortunate because,musically, it is terrific:  \\"You showed me things they never taught me in school\\" (uh, yeah). <br />\\"Dirty Livin'\\":  A Peter Criss number.  Like with \\"2,000 Man,\\" it is long (4:16), tends to drag and is repetitive.  I'm usually not crazy about Criss tracks but, I'll admit, this one is better than \\"Baby Driver\\" and I'll even put it above \\"Hooligan.\\" <br />\\"Charisma\\":  Now we're talking!  Awesome Gene Simmons track!  Intense verses, echo chamber chorus, and clever lyrics.  It is a very catchy track, too.  One of my five 5-Star tracks on Dynasty! <br /> <br />\\"Magic Touch\\":  Another favorite 5-Star track.  Paul's vocals are a highlight.  He displays a lot of feeling as well as range from the verses to the high, heartfelt bridge.  It has that disco feeling, but is slower.  The guitar kicks, too. <br />\\"Hard Times\\":  Another Ace track.  I find most of his few songs from this era (late 1970s-early 1980s) a bit stale.  The \\"Everyday life in the city\\" line feels lifeless. I guess his heart was not in it during this time.  He certainly understood the musical pulse better than his band-mates but, then we would never have been given Music: From the Elder, which I think is brilliant. Back to \\"Hard Times\\": the bridge does liven things up a bit as does the cool guitar solo. <br />\\"X-Ray Eyes\\":  Another Gene masterpiece!  It is not quite as cool as \\"Charisma,\\" but the chorus is very catchy.  The last of my 5-Star tracks on this album. <br />\\"Save Your Love\\":  The better of the Ace tracks on this album.  When I shut down my computer, I programmed the line \\"Girl, you know it's over, we had some good times, but now they're gone, so long.\\"
076790592X|5.0|My thoughts...     1) Morrie Schwartz was an amazingly inspirational man!! Not only in the wisdom he imparts to Mitch, but in how his spirit stayed so vibrant despite his very hard childhood and other harrowing life experiences. He was obviously an extraordinary human being!!      2) If this book doesn't touch your soul in some way, then I feel very sorry for you!! I feel I'm a better person for reading this, and I hope I can put Morrie's wisdom into practice in my own life.     Thank you Mitch Albom, for sharing this with us!! And thank you Morrie, for your gentle, nuturing spirit!!

B000GRU6XS|5.0|Well a much anticipated album and yes it is in true Maiden style... <br />Much like the previous comment, this album does take a bit of getting used to. So far it is taken me quite a few listens before I have really caught on to the songs and go away humming them in my head. The album has a sound of all the last 3 or so albums, particularly `The X-Factor'. The album has its war theme through out and the guys really have caught the emotions and feel of being in one I think. `Different World' Hmm... not quite Iron Maiden really, reminds me of `Rainmaker' very commercial but still is a good song. `These Colours Don't Run' is going to be a Maiden trademark. `Brighter Than a Thousand Suns' this song is just so powerful and well written with Maiden grunge. `The Pilgrim' you can tell Janick had a lot of input into this one. It has his trademark type guitar riff where I can see him on stage doing his walk-in-one-spot routine. `The Longest Day' - Dudes this song is awesome, great lyrics, and an opening you want to hear over and over again. I thought they should have kept with the style that the song opens in rather than change their style all the time (which is just like maiden anyway really). `Out of the Shadows' is kind of a Maiden ballad, still heavy but more slowly paced. `TROBB', this is one of the best songs on the album and i can't stop listening to it. Maiden have turned this into an awesome song which borders (I think) on being a bit commercial... but not quite!!?? It is like `Infinite Dreams' it will be very popular but it will be one of those ones that they wont play anymore, which is a shame. `For the Greater Good of God' in depth and with a lot of feeling. This will be played at concerts! `Lord of Light' Great song, catchy and will be another popular Maiden song by the fans. `The Legacy' as `Arry says this opens like a nursery rhyme. Top song and will be another Iron Maiden favourite! <br /> <br />So the album itself overall `AWESOME', give it a chance I guarantee it WILL grow on you. Usually they have one cruddy song on all albums that you skip over, not this one... Maiden has experimented I think and it really has paid off and Nicko is fantastic (being a drummer myself). It's hard to believe that they got this done in two months and they didn't record it one instrument at a time. Get the Limited Edition DVD if you can as it contains two videos `TROBB and Different World' and over 30 minutes of info on the guys recording the new album. <br /> <br />Maiden fans won't be disappointed! Another classic album on the rise! <br />
B00006690G|1.0|Oh boy, where to begin...Ok Eminem is some lame white kid who grew up in a wealthy suburban town with wealthy loving parents. Then this clown decided to dress like an african american and attempt to rap. And by rap I mean whine about how terrible his multi-million dollar life is. Boo Hoo I have fake mental problems and pretend my mom hates me! No suprise hundreds of lame rich white kids are buying his CDs and dressing like street hoodlums....then they go to college and become lawyers. What GANGSTAS!!! Go to the \\"ghetto\\" you won't see one person listening to this crap. Bottom Line: Eminem blows!
B000000YG5|4.0|This is of course, one of Sonny's best albums. I have all his recordings and the only problem with this album, is that the GREAT Max Roach, back in 1956 (when this album was recorded), was still, in my opinion, playing as if he were playing with a big band. Very powerful, which is great in a Big Band, but not fitting in the post Big Band Era.  On the other hand, if you listen to a few earlier Rollins albums from the early fifties, when Art Blakey accompanied him, you will see how Blakey always knew what to play with whomever he was playing. He was extremely versatile thoughout his career. Max Roach, on the other hand, in my opinion, was GREAT, but always played the same way. In the case of Post Big Band Jazz, he just didn't seem to play what was fitting. Always too hard and always too much whenever the bass player was doing his solo. Roach is great, but not with Rollins, and not my favorite drummer of the post Big Band era. Just my honest opinion of course, but if you like it, then enjoy it.
B00004U8JV|4.0|The lost world. Is far better than any corny horror dinosaur movies that we have ever seen. One of the pros is that they DID not use digital 2-d bleak dinosaurs. The dinosaurs in this movie. Looked EXTRMELY real. Too real, that you shouldn't let a 5-year old watch this. It looks real so that might scare a 5-year old.  <br /> And yeah I don't see how anyone could give this a bad rating. One of the bad things.. It didn't really have a good plot. I don't even know why anyone bothered to go back there. Capture a dinosaur that is four times the size of an elephant? Is that actually possible? You would have to have a team even better than the SWAT team to catch something like that. And how did the T-rex get out? and how could it possibly fit in one of these cabins that people walked in and found decapitated parts of people. And there wasn't even any damage done to the doors. So yeah who would believe that? <br /> But the dinosaur rampaging the civilized parts.. Was truly the best part. I mean, how often do you see a T-rex drinking from your pool? So yeah this movie is the best among the stupid and corny dinosaur movies that we have ever seen. I mean, how many dinosaur movies have we seen and actually got scared? Or even thrilled? Hmm? PROBABLY none. OBVIOUSLY.
B000AADYYO|2.0|Think of Opeth's music like it's a big plate of spaghetti.  On the bottom there are the long noddles that represent the stretched out melodies that intertwine around each other.  All around these noddles is the red marinara sauce which represents the aggressive, violent metal that is present in the music.  Finally, on the top there are mounds and mounds of Parmesan cheese layered thick.  There is both fresh and powdered Parmesan cheese all over it.  These cheeses represent the overly dramatic vocals and dynamics of the music.  Some people may love the extra cheese and some people think it ruins it because it's so excessive.  Either way, it's tough to find and taste those delicious noodles without going through the heavy amounts of cheese.    There should be no question that the guys in Opeth are innovative and skilled songwriters.  It's also true that there isn't any other metal band, or rock band, that sounds like them.  It's quite tough to find any legitimate negative criticism of their music anywhere.  However, all that doesn't mean Opeth is for everybody.  One fact that many people don't take into consideration is that there are some marketing tactics involved within this music.  It's a rather obvious thing, but most people get lost in the diverse artistic expression of the instrumentation and the vocal styles.  Opeth is in fact Swedish and they're not singing in their native language.  Using the English language means they're marketing their music to Americans.  It's the same reason that the Beatles and the Spice Girls don't have British accents when they sing.    If you can handle the cheesy dramatics and are still wanting to listen to Opeth, don't start with \\"Ghost Reveries.\\"  \\"Deliverance\\" was their peak album where they perfected their brand of progressive metal introduced on the past few albums, but they're now on a steady decline.  \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is too heavy on the synthesizers and production and nothing new has been introduced.  Don't feel bad if youdon't like Opeth.  It does not mean you're ignorant or slow.  If you've been diagnosed as ADHD or ADD, don't even attempt to listen to their music as it would be pure torture.  It takes quite a bit of focus and patience to digest what they have to offer and even then the rewards aren't all that great.
1400079179|5.0|I did not read this book when it first came out. I listened and read all of the hype about it for a couple of years. Finally earlier this year I did read the book. I mostly just wanted to find out what all the fuss was about. When I started to read this book I quickly realized that it would be a difficult book to put down. Within the first couple of pages there is a murder and the reader knows who the murderer is. The police start their investigation and call in a specialist - Robert Langdon - to help them. Before Langdon gets done with his initial look at the crime scene, he is clued into the fact that not all is as it seems. That is when the chase begins. One clue leads to another and a another and so on. Langdon not only has a \\"Code\\" to solve but he must do it while staying ahead of the police and the \\"Albino\\" who committed the murder. There are lots of twists and turns in this story and the action never stops. As for the religious ideas it brings up - well - that is for everyone to decide for themselves whether they believe it or not. I just know that I could not put the book down and I read it in less than a week.
0895260131|5.0|[...]:  This book should be required reading for everyone.  The author just gives the facts.  They are well documented.  The sources and references are spelled out so that the reader can easily check them.  It is too bad that our politcians, leaders and intellagence analysts have not read this book.  If they had, I am sure that we would be handling our problems with the Moslem world quite differently than we are.                                William F. Bos, P. E.

B00068C7WA|5.0|These are all my favorite Bill Joel songs.  I never tire of hearing them and having them compiled on one CD is fantastic! Fans will not be disappointed!
B000G7PMD2|4.0|I have been a die hard DT fan for years.I have seen a few stops on each tour from 6 degrees up to and including octavarium and I was also at this milestone show. I think the album is amazing, the only problem I have is that one or more of the string players are horribly flat during the entire second set. I noticed it during the show and I hoped that the band would do everything in their power to fix this problem. The most they could do was bring the entire string section down in the mix as soon as the band kicked in after the overture of 6 degrees. Now before people start attacking me, let me say that mistakes I can stand, we all make them. It's part of the live experience...but a flat violin is inexcusable. Instruments being played out of tune are one of the most offensive things to hear in music next to feedback. However, if you forget about that minor flaw, it's the best DT live album to date. After hearing Raise The Knife it makes you wonder why it never made the cut on falling into infinity. It's probably my favorite DT song right now. The setlist is perfect...the mix is perfect...and I can tell you that after being at the show ...that is exactly how the live house mix sounded that night which is very cool. Even though the strings weren't up to par...(and deserve a lesson in tuning their instruments)it didn't take any luster away from that special evening. That's the most important thing, so here's to 20 years of DT and we await 20 more.
0749303271|5.0|Since the birth of America in 1776, this country was known as the place where the poor could come and get rich. Reflected in the politic, religion, arts and literature; the possibility of hard-working, moral families falling thru the cracks and becoming poor was unspoken in the American psyche.  Yes, you could become poor if you took to the bottle, like Huck's father in \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Huck Finn\\".  Yes, you could become poor thru illegitimate and illicit behavior, such as the fate of the protagonist in the \\"Scarlet Letter\\".  And yes, if you were new to the country, your fate was likely poverty, such as that seen in Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\".  But to be a native of America, white, Christian, upright, and hardworking, you were expected to succeed, or at least survive.  Then came the harrowing experience that was the Great Depression and with it this novel, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\".<br /><br />Playing out in a series of alternating chapters; half the book lays forth the personal experiences of the Joad family and those they cross paths with from Oklahoma to the grape fields of California.  The other half of the book extends the experiences of this one family to those of the nation.  To read this book is to understand the mechanisms by which individuals, families, and entire communities succumb to poverty, crime, destitution, and eventually death.  The trials of the Joad family at the hands of banks, lending agencies, the police, creditors and employers is all to real back then and now.  For example, within an impoverished community, creditors will often divide and conquer by offering jobs to the very poorest that require them to betray their fellow citizens; such as repossessing their property.<br /><br />One of the most important, and missed points of this book, is how the economic success of entire communities depends on mother nature.  The Dust Bowl is a great example of economic disaster caused by natural events; a unique tragedy in US history, but a yearly experience in many other countries.  Another important point in this book is that when it comes down to it, the US economy is built along the same lines as those of other countries past and present; land ownership.  The wealth of the US and the relatively high living standards here can be argued to be due to the large amount of livable land.<br /><br />All in all this is one of the best books written in the 20th century.  A careful reading of it provides insights into economics, sociology, human behavior, agriculture practices, the entire concept of property rights, migration and immigration, and the convolution of business and politics.  I highly recommend this book.perience in many other countries.

B00000DHZJ|5.0|If any music lover wishes to break into the works of Jimi Hendrix then this CD is the perfect place to start. To certain uninitiated newcomers there are songs in the Hendrix repertoire that may seem daunting, both in musical complexity and in sheer length. This is where the Experience Hendrix CD comes into its own. <br /> <br />Hendrix contributed a massive wealth of guitar anthems to the world of rock and some of the best are on show here. 'Voodoo Child', 'Purple Haze' and 'All Along The Watchtower' being some of the best known. However this is not to say that rocking guitar solos was all that Jimi did. He also slows the mood with the more laid back 'Castles Made Of Sand', 'Bold As Love' and the beautifully lonesome 'The Wind Cries Mary'. <br /> <br />Jimi Hendrix's career was tragically short, spanning only 4 years. But in that time he managed to unleash some of the best rock songs ever made. To any music fans reading I have one word to say, 'enjoy'.
0465092756|4.0|The first part - essentially an account of the development of the standard model - really isn't aimed at the layperson at all - the total lack of equations notwithstanding. I much prefer F. Close's \\"The Cosmic Onion\\" (released in 1983 but a new edition called \\"The New Cosmic Onion\\" is now available), Veltman's \\"Facts and Mysteries in Elementary Particle Physics\\" or even Lisa Randall's account in her very popular \\"Warped passages\\". However, Peter Woit does show some originality in approaching the matter from a mathematician's point of view, and in elucidating the important role of Hermann Weyl in the development of quantum mechanics, something you certainly won't find in other popular books on theoretical physics.         The second part sets out to prove that String Theory (ST), the acclaimed (or proclaimed?) successor of the standard model - is \\"not even wrong\\", meaning that this theory can't even be falsified.  A very ungrateful task, given a) the attractiveness String Theory noticeably exerts on both professional theoretical physicists and laypersons alike (as evidenced by the huge popularity of Brian Greene's and Michio Kaku's books, amongst others); and b) the fact that alternative (and far less celebrated) approaches seem to be - from a layman's perspective at least - as tentative as ST.   I cannot say his strategy appears to be very coherent - we rather get a succession of pinprick attacks. Each of those in itself would probably not have convinced me there was something wrong with ST, but taken together, they succeed in making ST far less incontestable than some popular science writers would have us believe.    This is not a book I would easily recommend to the average lay person totally ignorant of particle physics - one would have to read a number of other popular science books first (*) - but to my knowledge Peter Woit is the first who dared to challenge the \\"ST establishment\\" so openly and fearlessly. If only for the sake of \\"open-mindedness\\", I suggest one reads this book (and preferably Lee Smolin's book \\"The Trouble with physics\\" also), together with some of the excellent popular books on ST if you haven't already done so.     (*) In fact, I would almost consider A. Schumm's \\"Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics\\" compulsory reading before attempting to read the first part of Woit's book.
B000002LLC|5.0|Lost among the hype and drama behind the \\"Dick Tracy\\" film, the tabloid fodder of the Warren Beatty affair, and Madonna's own self-generated hoopla, is this pretty terrific record. <br /> <br />\\"I'm Breathless\\" incorporates songs from the film as well as pastiches and novelties she created based on her \\"character\\" of Breathless Mahoney. <br /> <br />The thing you will notice first is a definite maturation of Madonna's singing ability. She had clearly been taking lessons, and she hits notes here with a stability and clarity she never managed before. In the album's opener, \\"He's A Man\\", it is clear she's trying to do something a bit different than what we have come to expect from Miss Ciccone. <br /> <br />With \\"Sooner or Later\\", she for the most part pulls off a great Broadway-like ballad (there are one or two wobbly notes). Having somebody like Stephen Sondheim helps out with some songs only hedges her bets at making a successful attempt in this arena. <br /> <br />Just so you remember who we're dealing with here, she follows up with \\"Hanky Panky\\", a bouncy, sassy, naughty barrel roll of a song...this would have NO place on any other Madonna record, buts fits just fine here. <br /> <br />The same goes for \\"I'm Going Bananas\\" and \\"Cry Baby.\\" The former, a silly romp with exquisite Latin instruments and beats (although sung in an accent as if she's impersonating her housekeeper), the latter a Betty Boop retro piece with all the substance of whipped cream. <br /> <br />\\"Something To Remember\\" gives us a radio-friendly slow song, which actually sounds out of place on THIS record, but would probably be a highlight of any of her other subsequent ones. <br /> <br />\\"Back in Business\\" is an uptempo, show-bizzy, Broadway-ish lark. <br /> <br />\\"More\\" is a spectacular twist on Gershwin's \\"I Got Rhythm\\"...fans of Tin Pan Alley and Broadway shows will eat this one up. <br /> <br />\\"What Can You Lose\\" is a slow, minimalist duet with Mandy Patinkin. I'm a big Patinkin fan, so I'mbiased, and she manages NOT to get blown out of the water here, so that's saying something. <br /> <br />\\"Now I'm Following You\\", parts 1 & 2...is a strange little creation. First of all, there's Warren Beatty \\"singing.\\" It's kinda weird, but not totally awful. Then there's the tempo shift halfway through, which turns an old-fashioned ballad into a scratchy, hip-hop-ish dance song. Again, weird, but not totally awful. I actually like it, in the same way I like cherry Slurpees at 7-11. I probably shouldn't like 'em, but if I'm being honest, I really do. <br /> <br />And then there's \\"Vogue\\", a masterful dance track, a killer single. Paired with an iconic video and popularizing a club trend of the time, it arrived at a perfect time to be another monster hit...yet it's appearance here is strictly as an added track. It could have been on ANY Madonna record, but the majority of the rest of these songs could ONLY have been on \\"I'm Breathless\\". <br /> <br />This CD desperately needs remastering...but it still sounds as good as CDs from that era could possibly be, which is pretty darn fine. <br /> <br />A personal favorite of mine...but then again, there's the whole cherry Slurpee thing.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I INSTANTLY became addicted to this show last year. The characters are so in depth and real. The way the brothers interact with each other is so incredibly believable and really makes the show what it is. As far as the ghouls on the show go, it's spectacular. The research that must have gone it to writing this show...you have to give the writers credit. I look forward to the start of the next season!
0553804677|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - it was rich in every way - characters, place, history, magic mixed with the mundane, stories waiting to be told around every corner. <br /> <br />This is a four-star book, and not a five, because it is like the best 'pop' music, in that it is very good for a very wide audience, but nothing is absolutely fantastic literary work that will be remembered indefinitely. If you're looking for a wonderful distraction - like a great romp of a movie, this is it.  <br /> <br />I only hesitate in that I think (and hope) that in his future efforts, we will see improvements in the following ways: <br /> <br />**generalized spoilers follow** <br /> <br />1. (and this is the foremost one that I struggle with) Locke may be the heroic villain, but there is no true transition from immaturity to maturity. In the beginning, he's a terrible knave and in the end he's a noble knave, but we have little reason to believe he's gone from being utterly immoral and self-centered to being loyal and somewhat principled. We are told through the narrative that he is, but the implication is that if you're an evil genius you naturally become loyal to your compatriots and have what everyone would agree is a basic approach to morality - but not absolute immorality. But in the real world, people who start out like that have to be forced into realizing they can't and shouldn't be evil. Unfortunately, I couldn't love the character as much as I might because I couldn't believe he'd really learned to be 'good' even to the small degree that he was. <br /> <br />2. Unfortunately, Lynch did have the habit of creating 'Rocky' scenarios where the 'good guys' are totally beaten down and then suddenly out of nowhere are able to come back with a whalloping series of punches as if they'd never been down. (Granted that not everyone who we are supposed to care about works out so well, still it seems awfully fortunate time and again for Locke, in particular.) <br /> <br />3. I personallycouldn't suffer (the way I think the author wanted me to) along with Locke, through which the suffering was channeled. This is because Locke is the one responsible for everything bad that happens to him and those around him (except, I suppose, for the final dastardly plan). If, perhaps, I saw the suffering through the eyes of those who followed Locke to their doom then I would be in more pain, but of course, I might despise instead of sympathize with Locke, mightn't I? <br /> <br />4. Unfortunately, the main foil to Locke's otherwise unimpeded genius and success comes off at the end as nothing more than a desperate and obsessed common criminal since his bankroll is apparently promises rather than genuine wealth and genius. <br /> <br />**generalized spoilers end** <br /> <br />But, to close on a proper note, this is a very fast-paced, FUN read. (I distinctly recall particular moments when I had to force myself to slow down so I could take in the scene properly since I wanted so badly to discover what craziness was transpiring.)  <br /> <br />1. The landscapes of the book are absolutely wonderful in every way. <br />2. The customs and peoples and histories are rich and complete (while creating in me a desire to read whatever more may be written about them). <br />3. The lore of magic and magicians is a wonderful unusual method that makes them unusual and exotic while not being inaccessibly legendary. <br /> <br />I absolutely will read further installments.
B000002MFN|2.0|I think I'm listening to a different album than the rest of the reviewers. <br />\\"Erotica\\" is Madonna's first, flat-out failure as a musical artist. <br /> <br />Something was changing when she added \\"Justify My Love\\" to her greatest hits album. OK...it had a killer, sinuous beat, and she moaned over it, more speaking than singing, and it had that video. <br /> <br />She dips into that well too many times here, without any of the sexy kick. She's visibly trying to be provocative and it doesn't come off that way. <br /> <br />'\\"Erotica\\" (the song) is a boring club jam with no melody: it's not a song, it's a groove. It's background. It's wallpaper. <br /> <br />\\"Fever\\" is another of Madonna's homages to old songs, and it's simply an average cover version. Better than karaoke, wouldn't fly on American Idol. <br /> <br />\\"Bye Bye Baby\\" starts off awesome...great, high-register, whispery vocals with an irresistible melody...but comes crashing down with an awful chorus and a production that just buries her voice (a common problem on this album). <br /> <br />\\"Deeper and Deeper\\" is the one song for the compilation CD. Madonna pops out another one of her classic club anthems that would also sound fine on a car radio. Her voice is in fine form; she's much better at singing those lower notes than she was back on \\"Like A Prayer.\\" This one's a keeper. <br /> <br />\\"Where Life Begins\\", like so much of the rest of the album, is boring to the point of being unable to recall a note by the time the next song is through, like \\"Waiting\\", \\"Secret Garden\\", \\"Words\\" or \\"Why's It So Hard\\". <br /> <br />\\"Bad Girl\\" is a standard ballad, and done well, but the lyrics fail her. \\"Bad girl/drunk by six. Kissing some kind stranger's lips\\"...hello? That's an average college co-ed at a Friday night frat party. What's the big deal? <br /> <br />\\"Thief of Hearts\\" makes you think Stacey Q did this stuff better. <br /> <br />And that's a big problem, this set of overlong songs, for the most part, havebeen done better by lots of other people, including Madonna herself. <br /> <br />\\"Rain\\" is a much better ballad, and probably the other selection for your iPod. <br /> <br />\\"In This Life\\", a catastrophically boring song, is significant (for me) only because the melody is borrowed from a Gershwin piano piece, \\"Prelude #2.\\" <br />I'm not a classical music lover by ANY stretch of imagination; the song was one of my recital pieces when I took piano lessons back in junior high. <br /> <br />\\"Did You Do It?\\" is just awful, a pointless rap with minimal Madonna in it. Why is it even here? <br /> <br />Up to this point in her career, this is her worst album. By far.

B000G1ALRK|4.0|An impressive debut for North Carolina native Eric Church, whose recent hit \\"How `Bout You\\" reached the top 15. <br /> <br />Eric Church wrote or co-wrote all of the songs contained on this CD, most of which are good songs. I must admit that I would like to have seen him tackle one or two pieces of \\"Classic Country\\", if only to see if he could do them justice, but maybe he'll take up that challenge later (maybe I should give him some credit for \\"Pledge Allegiance To The Hag\\" which features a brief cameo by the Mighty Merle). <br /> <br />Most of the songs on SINNERS LIKE ME fall into the \\"good ol' boy\\" vein with the songs having a contemporary feel to them.  I really liked \\"Can't Take It With You\\" and \\"Before She Does\\" but I suspect that the real breakthrough for Church will be \\"Two Pink Lines\\" a clever twist on the the anxieties of pregnancy tests.  <br /> <br />The most unusual song on the CD is \\"Death Row\\", a topic not generally touched on in Country Music - the most similar songs to it were Marty Robbins' \\"The Chair\\" (1971) and Mac Wiseman's \\"Just Outside\\" (1964) although songs such as \\"The Green Green Grass of Home\\" (Johnny Darrell - 1965) and \\"The Long Black Veil\\" (Lefty Frizzell - 1959) skirted the issue <br /> <br />If allowed fractional ratings I'd give it 4.5 stars
B000GPIPVU|5.0|One of those lonely nights channel surfing until I landed on Austin City Limits.  Ray was performing.  Couldn't change the channel after that.  Bought his break-out album \\"Trouble\\" as soon as I could.  I have been waiting for this second album with great anticipation.  I lined up to get it, pre-ordering it and hoping that it wouldn't disappoint.  AWESOME.  Ray's second album is better than his first.  Mostly mellow stuff that just wraps its fingers around a mood and won't let you go.  But it's a mood to chill out in until something else awful comes along and rips you out of it - like a job.  \\"Empty\\" \\"Can I Stay\\" \\"Lesson Learned\\" and \\"Till The Sun Turns Black\\" are my favorites.  I heard an interview that NPR did with Ray recently.  I had to smile when he refused to answer a question about his family.  A privacy zealot I can relate to.  You can imagine my satisfaction in hearing him say that he has at least a couple more albums to deliver.  I'll be waiting in line.
0385486804|3.0|I have mixed feelings about Jon Krakauer's _Into the Wild_.  The story of a young man who attempted to live without modern convieniences in the Alaskan wild is interesting, all the more so because of the inital questions surrounding his death.  At the same time, there is an element of sensationalism about the story, which I did not care for.  Alaska is full of stories of people who come to tragic ends because they underestimate nature or overestimate their skills.<br /><br />Krakauer paints a sympathetic picture of Christopher McCandless, and provides a detailed and comprehensive accounting of his travels prior to his excursion into the Alaskan wild.  Certainly McCandless was not crazy or mentally imbalanced, and the impact he had on those who knew him (even if only briefly) speaks to his charisma.  Yet I cannot feel sympathy or even empathy with one who so flippantly gambles with nature.<br /><br />Krakauer, to some extent addresses this as well, attempting to understand the motives behind McCandless' foolishness, relating an event from his own youth in which he attempted a similar test of his mettle.  For me, this was the best part of the book - unfortunately, I had to wait until the tail end to find this. A mildly interesting read, but I can't give it more than three stars.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|First, in response to the previous \\"reviews\\" let's take into consideration that the person comparing The Beatles to Metallica couldn't spell simple words, such as \\"instead\\". I'm a huge Metallica fan, but Metallica wouldn't be where they are without the Beatles. It's like comparing a 1967 Shelby GT to a 2006 Mustang GT. Both very sexy cars, both high performers...however, you wouldn't have the 2006 had there not been the '67 and a lot of style and originality is lost over almost 40 years. The '67 will always be the original, will always be a classic, will always be loved and will always be part of history, which makes it \\"better\\" to those who value the classics. Those who value more horsepower will think the '06 is \\"better\\"...*technically*, neither is right, neither is wrong. It's an opinion. Personally, I'm a '67 fan, and therefore, despite my love of Metallica, would never put them above the Beatles. Any music aficionado will point out that the Beatles have covered a much wider range of emotion and musical talent than Metallica will ever cover, and I agree. My car comparison can never cover the entire scope of the talent of the Beatles. I'm sure you can appreciate what I'm *trying* to get across =D <br /> <br />That said, this is a review of the album and for Beatles lovers, this is a must have CD for the car. It covers every stage of the Beatles' career and there are plenty of songs to get you to and from work. Because of it's coverage of all the levels of their artistic talent, you can take an audible trip through their career from 1963 to 1970, and for those lucky enough to have experienced the 60's and 70's, a trip through your own childhood/adolescence.

B00005JP89|4.0|\\"The Illusionist\\" is a beautfully made film that engages the imagination rather than the mind.  I would have preferred that the illusions were more realistic; here, the effects depend far too much on soft focus and other cinematic effects to be truly convincing.  But, ultimately, that doesn't really matter.  If you get swept up in the story, you are likely to overlook the demands it makes on credibility.  The lead actors do a masterful job of distracting their audience from the flaws in the screenplay--a sort of legerdemain in itself.  When Edward Norton, as Eisenheim, steps onto a blank stage and sits in his chair, he commands our attention.  Never mind that his audience have paid for a show that only lasts about five minutes.  When Paul Giamatti, as the police inspector, discovers the heart-shaped pendant in the stable, only to have it picked from his pocket in broad daylight, never mind that Eisenheim, who made the pendant in the first place, could have saved his beloved (and himself) a lot of anxiety simply by making a duplicate of the piece and using that in the \\"illusion.\\"  Who would have been the wiser?  Exposing other holes in the plot would reveal too much of the ending, but suffice it to say they are there, if you look for them.  I, however, was too busy soaking up the film's ambience (pre-War Vienna in the waning days of the Hapsburg Empire) to be overly concerned with plot holes. I was also amazed by the transformations of Norton and Giamatti, both of whom have appeared most comfortable in the past playing 20th c. American schlubs.  For the director to be able to convince me that Norton is a bearded (and very romantic) \\"illusionist\\" of the belle epoque, or that Giamatti might possibly be the inspector of police in Vienna at such a pivotal time in history, requires a lot of, let's just say it, magic. I fell under the spell of this movie, and, for all its faults, recommend it to anyone who has ever visited Vienna, or, in this case, Prague, in the spring (kudos to Philip Glass, by the way, for a masterly score) or who has ever been in love.udos to Philip Glass, by the way, for a masterly score) or who has ever been in love.

B000FGGE68|1.0|I have to admit having lowered expectations toward Ultraviolet. Initial reviews of the movie upon its release were...well...not good.  But lowered expectations aside, I rented Ultraviolet for two reasons: Milla! and I loved writer/director Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium.  What we have with Ultraviolet is a video game come to life.  Only it's about as interesting or entertaining as watching someone else playing it.  What little backstory we get (and it ain't much) is ridiculously convoluted.  Something about scientists trying to engineer superior soldiers who instead create an airborne virus with vampire-like symptoms, hundreds are infected, they dissapear into concentration camps, an underground resistance springs up, so on.  The film takes place in the same kind of future world as Equilibrium, only with a bigger budget.  The action, which worked well in Equilibrium, Wimmer has taken way over the top here.  Violet (played by Jovovich) has a device on her belt buckle that enables her to go all wonky on gravity, walking on the ceiling and driving her motorcycle up the side of the buildings and her wristbands - a kind of technology called \\"flat technology\\" - enables her to carry an arsenal of weaponry up her sleeve, literally.  We get tons of Wimmer's patented \\"Gun-kata,\\" but it lacks anything close to resembling kinetic energy and is really just boring.  All the action sequences are boring!  And the whole movie is one extended, green screen, CGI action sequence.  What little meat the story has (and there ain't much) has gone rancid.  It's too bad for those of us who loved his first movie and looked forward to see what he'd do next.  This is unfortunetly it.  Ultraviolet isn't just bad.  It's wow bad.  Skip it.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|Haven't seen Dream Theater play live for several years now. But, this 2-DVD release reminds me just how brilliant this band really is. 'Score: 20th Anniversary' was taped live on April Fool's Day, 2006 at the Radio City Music Hall. Sort of dug the way that so many fans were taking flash photos of the performance, made me feel like I was actually there (sort of). No doubt this was truly a flawless live performance. Great sound and picture quality. I've never been much for a rock & roll band having a full orchestra behind them. But the WAY that Dream Theater does it, I really don't mind. Some of the better cuts were \\"I Walk Behind You\\", \\"Afterlife\\", \\"Under A Glass Moon\\", \\"Octavarium\\", \\"War Inside My Head\\" among others. That's only the first DVD. Disc two features plenty of bonus material. An absolute must-have.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This movie was so good in so many ways.  Please watch the movie, analyze the writing, acting, cinematography..., then analyze the \\"messages\\"! <br /> <br />Disclaimer: I have not read the graphic novel, but I intend to.   <br /> <br />The acting is first rate. Hugo Weaving was outstanding.  My first thought was, why hire a real actor for a role that never shows his face?.  Then I watched.  Weaving expresses all of V's emotions / thoughts without one actual facial expression.  Phenomenal really.  Must give credit to the directing as well.  It's remarkable.  Even Batman shows some of his face, making facial expressions a partial tool for the actor / directors.  They do it without this option. <br /> <br />The writing is first rate.  I'm going to watch it a few more times just for the script.  It's like poetry to me.  The dialog ranks high for me, on scale with a Tarantino film (pick one).  My wife pointed out that, in addition to the spoken word, the lack of speech is also important.  Example is, when V picks up the domino near the end of the movie he says nothing, just gives a look.  Most action movies would have some kind of cheesy line here.  This film needs nothing of the sort.    <br /> <br />The story was spellbinding and hypnotic.  I had to pay attention to everything because there was a lot going on.  It was as interesting as a David Lynch film, but the story went somewhere and is clear in the end if you pay attention.  I did not move from the couch from start to finish.  Parts of the conspiracy reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK.  Masterful.  I would rank it close to masterpiece. <br /> <br />The use of the 1812 overture would be a cliche in most movies, but in this one it's perfect.  One of the most spectacular pieces of music ever written.  How appropriate. <br /> <br />The question of politics cannot be avoided.  Clearly it is a film with \\"messages\\".  This is not a standard action movie.  If you want an action movie, go rent Spiderman! <br /> <br />I have watched twice, and must say that Sutler bears little if any likeness to Bush.  Bush is a bumbling idiot and couldn't hold this guys microphone!  Sutler is like Hitler, and if you missed this, you were not watching!!  There are similarities, but my first and overriding thought was of Hitler. <br /> <br />I am very right wing on the subject of terrorism.  Yet I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It's not an indictment of Bush specifically.  If this is what you saw, you either were not paying attention, looking for something that was not there, or are very closed minded.  This is much deeper than anti Bush.   <br /> <br />It is vitally important to continually question our motives, check our \\"progress\\", review our \\"beliefs\\".  If you come with an open mind, this film will cause you to do this.  True, the 1984 theme has been used countless times.  That does not take away the validity of using the theme again and again.  In fact, it's important to use it often so we don't wind up like the society in this film.

B000BNX4MC|5.0|Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a kind of hero to every high-school aged young adult out there. He's the kind of guy whom we all want to be, really. He acts like he doesn't have a care in the world, and lives life to fullest. The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris. In this film, Ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another \\"sick\\" day for him, his ninth to be exact. In order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick, he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process. Another antithesis of Ferris is his life-is-not-fair sister Jeannie(Jennifer Grey) who suspects something is up, as does the sly-but-not-so-slick Dean of Students, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). <br />It's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen For instance, Ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days. It's amazing; people, like his parents who are most easily duped, would think that this one sick kid when in reality, he's having a ball. However, knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate, he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile. Ferris and Cameron bail out Ferris' girl Sloane (Mia Sara) with a dead grandmother ploy, and together the trio spend the day doing the town in Chicago driving the '61 GT convertible (Oh, yeah!). This movie has a special message and feeling to it that's as old as time. It's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life. For after all, as our hero says: \\"Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop to take a look every once in a while, you might miss it.\\" That's the moral of the story, really.  <br />\\"Bueller...Bueller...Bueller?\\" Not here, but he'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life, and showing you how to open your eyesin making the most of every day.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Every once in a while, a surprise and unexpected collaboration yields stunning results. Under the coruscating lights of the music world where increasingly any nobody can be a star, Gnarls Barkley is a breath of fresh air, bringing together established hip-hopper Cee-Lo (one part of Goobie Mob) and ace producer Danger Mouse (Gorillaz' Demon Days).<br /><br />Reminiscent of Outkast's polished and neurotic sound, Gnarls Barkley has the additional edge of a modern hip-hop sound mashed with refined electro-beats. Whether it's soulful singing on the wonderful first single Crazy or funky rap-song on Transformer, Cee-Lo demonstrates impeccable sensibilities like hip hop is running through his veins. Danger Mouse complements all these with equally perfect arrangement and production of cool electronic beats and stutter.<br /><br />The album has quirky lyrics, is sometimes funny, sometimes serious but quite unquestionably a dull moment never exist. Some might find such neurotism to be an inconsistency but when you put on the record, you'll be drawn in by the pomposity. (A)

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|If you are NOT an avowed Iliad fan, if you CAN handle plot deviations, or don't mind seeing Paris, Prince of Troy, humiliated to the extent that Wolfgang Petersen has subjected him to, you will enjoy this terrific movie.  I saw it twice in the theater, when it first came out, and then purchased the DVD and watched many more times at home.  Or, even if you are a diehard Iliad fan like me, still ... watch this movie for Brad Pitt's superb Achilles (until this role, I had not cared for him, but now am a fan of his), Eric Bana's down-to-earth, solid, Hector, Peter O'Toole's terrific King Priam, Brian Cox' entirely believable Agamemnon, and Brendan Gleeson's Menelaus, King of Sparta and Helen's husband. So, the cast is terrific. Alas, Helen and Andromache, with not too many meaty scenes given to them to sink their pealry whites into as an actress, come across as cartoonish. Oh, the exception is the actress who played Briseis, she who has been given the immortal line (as she addresses Achilles): \\"And I had thought you were a brute. A brute, I could have forgiven...\\"   I LOVED the alternate manner with which Menelaus, the double-dealing husband of Helen, is treated here. Yessss, I confess my guilty pleasure: I cheered! And cheered again when I watched it for the second time, and ditto, for the third time.  My two complaints are how shabbily Paris (Orlando Bloom doing a reasonably well as an actor, making lemonade of the lemons handed to him) is portrayed, and the missing presence of the gods. The Iliad includes the interaction between gods and men, and the pettiness these capricious gods are capable of. They manipulated the war from its onset, and engineered its outcome by helping Achilles by giving him that armor made by Hephaestus, and with Athene distracting Hector during that famed battle royale between these two giant warriors.  So, thumbs down on that aspect, since if Petersen deleted the gods to make it a more realistic story, then he should have made it more authentic -- historically.    Much has been written about the plot, by the 343 + reviewers who have preceded me at amazon, so am not opining another word about how and how much it scoots away from the Iliad.     What the heck, this is a TERRIFIC movie, not a history or Classics lesson, with plenty of cinemascopic scenery. When you are finished, do pay attention to the extras on the second disc, which contains a lot of good, extra information.

B000F7CMRM|3.0|\\"Syriana\\" attempts to do for the oil industry what \\"The Constant Gardner\\" did for the pharmaceutical industry: expose corruption in the system and collusion between Big Business and the Government.  \\"Syriana\\", told in flashbacks, is therefore both timely and controversial. The actors are more than competent; the cinematography is more than accomplished; and the musical score is sufficiently riveting. Unfortunately, \\"Syriana\\" lacks the fundamental assets that made \\"The Constant Gardener\\" work as a movie even if one did not agree with its political agenda: the guidance of an experienced world-class director, Fernando Mireilles; a memorable musical score by a world-class composer, Alberto Iglesias; and, most importantly, a screenplay based upon the novel of a world-class novelist, John Le Carre, a past-master at balancing the intricacies of plot in such a way that the reader or viewer can still perceive the thread of the narrative.<br /><br />The fast-paced cutting between sequences  seems intended to provide \\"Syriana\\" with an edgy feel. However, as others have commented at length, the technique serves only to confuse. For example, a subtitle will read \\"Geneva,\\" and then, suddenly, without any notice, the viewer has been transported to an office complex in Langley, Virginia, or Washington, D.C.; the playing fields of an anonymous oil-rich country; the docks of Beirut,  or some place in Mallorca (etc., etc.).

0451196716|5.0|I just bought a used copy of The Bachman Books and The Long Walk was one I just had to read (tried Rage first but wasn't as impressed with that as this one). This was the main story that attracted me to the book. Also, the Rage novel was a buying point being that it is no longer in print due to the school shootings in the past decade or so. The Running Man (I preferred the movie to this) and Roadwork are also good, but The Long Walk is the best of the bunch, for me. <br /> <br />The Long Walk is more than the typical Stephen King (or Richard Bachman) book. Much like King's other novels about male youth (The Body, Dreamcatcher, Hearts In Atlantis, IT etc) you find yourself relating to the characters. While a story about walking can be repeatative and boring, King outdoes himself here by focusing on the characters involved. He pulls you into the story slowly until you feel like you are one of the 100 walking. <br /> <br />I found myself so involved in this novel that I felt as if I were walking right along with these characters. Despite rooting against each other at first, there is a bond that takes place so that near the end it became sadder each time a boy was killed. The prize being \\"everything you want\\" is a bit vague, but it's also a double-edged sword. The one thing that can't be given as a prize is all the friends lost on \\"The Long Walk\\". They are gone for good. The toll that the walking takes is also another double-edged sword because the survivor is so worn down that he is a shell of his former self. <br /> <br />It's amazing how King took an everyday thing for most of us (just simply walking) and turned it into a horrific event. Seeing others around you killed and knowing it could be you if you get more than three warnings, could play games with your mind. No stopping to rest, to eat, to go to the bathroom. No stopping for sleep or charley-horses or a pebble in your shoes. Seeing the crowds eating, sitting and relaxing also would play with your mind. I'm sure most people have walked so far that you felt you couldn't continue. It's easy to relate to for most of us. That's where King is at his best, when he reaches into your soul and gives you something that you can relate to. <br /> <br />This book is simply a great read. It makes you stop and think about human nature. Why we do some of the things we do and sometimes not think ahead at how hard it could be. The walkers themselves are celebrities in this world created by King. Much like reality shows today have made celebrities (Survivor, Dancing With Stars, American Idol). It is amazing King saw ahead all those years ago when he wrote this novel, that reality shows would take everyday people and put them in contests like this. <br /> <br />This is one of King's (or Bachman's) best novels. Very hard to put down. Despite knowing that 99 of the 100 will be killed King manages to make you give a damn about all the contestants. There is a sadness each time someone is killed. I have to give this novel a 5 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />

B00005JLD4|5.0|This has definitely been one of the most moving and inspirational films I've watched recently. Between 1900 and 1970, at least 100,000 Aboriginal children of mixed blood - called \\"half caste\\" - were taken from their families by the Australian government. Some were surrendered with their parents' consent, but many were forcibly removed. They have been referred to as the Stolen Generations. These children were placed in government or church-run schools in an attempt to assimilate them into white culture. The living conditions in these institutions were generally poor. The children were also discouraged from speaking their own languages, and also from marrying full-blood Aboriginals, the belief being that if they intermarried with whites instead, all Aboriginal traits could be \\"bred out\\" within four generations. It was common for children to attempt escape from these facilities, but most never made it far before being recaptured. This story, however, is different.<br /><br />The film \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence,\\" based on the book \\"Molly's Daughter\\" by Doris Pilkington (which is in turn based on the true story of her own mother), follows three girls in the 1930's - two of them sisters and the third a cousin - who are taken from their family as described above. They are placed in the Moore River Camp, almost 2000 kilometers from their home. It is not long before the eldest girl, Molly, decides that they must escape and return to their family. Molly (14 years old), Gracie (10 years), and Daisy (8 years) soon find their way to the rabbit-proof fence of the title, a structure bisecting the entire continent with the aim of keeping rabbits on one side and good farmland on the other. Knowing that their village lies along the fence, they set out on an arduous nine-week journey to follow it home, all the while tracked by those that want them recaptured.<br /><br />This is an amazing film in so many ways. The casting all around is brilliant, but the three girls who play Molly, Gracie, and Daisy are particularly remarkable. None of them had any previous acting experience, but their performances are completely natural, neither underacted nor over-the-top. Most amazing of all is Everlyn Sampi (actually 12, though her charatcer is 14) as Molly, and Tianna Sansbury as young Daisy is also incredibly talented for a 7-year-old. I hope both of them choose to go on to work in other movies, because they truly have a rare natural talent. The rest of the cast is also superb, with the notable Kenneth Branagh taking a key role as A.O. Neville, official \\"Protector of the Aborigines\\" in Western Australia.<br /><br />The cinematography and soundtrack are also quite perfect. One really gets a feel for how beautiful, and how rugged and forbidding, the Western Australian desert country can be. For anyone to have made a 1,500-mile journey across it on foot is remarkable, and for this to have been accomplished by such young children is truly inspirational. The film also shows the complicated interplay of race relations quite well. It is not a clear-cut black-and-white issue (and clearly the protagonists are neither fully Aboriginal, nor fully white themselves). There are of course characters firmly planted on one side or the other, but there are also many stuck in the middle, such as the Aboriginal man employed as a tracker to recover the runaways, or the half-caste laundry woman - herself a former ward of the Moore River Camp - who attempts to help them along the way. These characters hightlight the turmoil of being stuck between two worlds. It should also be noted that not all white people in the film are portrayed as villains, as we see the girls aided by sympathetic non-Aborginals as well.<br /><br />The DVD offers only two special features - commentary with the director, screenwriter, author, and Kenneth Branagh, as well as a documentary on the making of the film - but the documentary, \\"Following the Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" is well worth watching. I was touched to seehow intent director Phillip Noyce was on getting the movie just right, so that it would resonate with both the descendants of those included in the Stolen Generations, and with a white Australian audience. The lengths he went to in order to find just the right three girls to play Molly, Gracie, and Daisy - flying to numerous remote towns to interview hundreds of children - are also impressive. Even more touching is to see just how much the young actors put into the film. In one shot we see the entire cast and crew reduced to tears after filming the abduction scene at the beginning of the movie. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this film to any viewer, and plan to add it to my own collection as well.ce was on getting the movie just right, so that it would resonate with both the descendants of those included in the Stolen Generations, and with a white Australian audience.

B00005NKKZ|5.0|How exquisite are the two most celebrated songs from 'Bridge Over Troubled Water,' Simon and Garfunkel's greatest album and worthy of a top ten list of pop/rock music. \\"The Boxer\\" and \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" deserve their reputation for their hair-raising excellence. The build up, the beautiful vocals, and the orchestration are magnificent. Less heralded is the album's versatality. The exotic rhythms of \\"El Condor Pasa\\" and \\"Cecilia\\" are expert. Then, there are the quieter gems, like \\"Farewell to Frank Lloyd Wright,\\" the tender \\"The Only Living Boy in New York,\\" and the closer \\"Song for the Asking\\". Simon and Garfunkel aren't simply substantial, they are playful masters. They ably incorporate jazz with \\"Keep the Customer Satisfied,\\" complete with excellent lyrics that concicely evoke themes from 'Death of a Salesman'. They even have the irreverence to poke fun by wearily blurting out \\"Enough, already!\\" after their tribute to Frank Lloyd Wright. (Maybe it was all allegory and tongue-in-cheek anyway, but it works well in any case.) Not only are they playful with \\"Cecilia,\\" but with the lively \\"Baby Driver\\" and \\"Why Don't You Write Me\\". They even have a super live version of \\"Bye Bye Love,\\" as if they were lacking any confidence.  <br /> <br />'Bridge Over Troubled Water' is easily a top ten pop/rock classic of all time. It isn't just filled with ethereal classics; it has all the components of a remarkably varied masterpiece.  <br />
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I'm a trauma surgeon and really didn't like any TV series. WB channel brings Violence or Comedy (many of them pure stupidity).  <br />My choice changed with Everwood, which I watched while on a 24-hour duty years ago. <br />Everwood brings real life: anger, pity, failure, success, love, passion... <br />There are no superheroes, no perfect people. Just real people. <br />With so many series entering their th year recorded and sold in DVD I really can't understand why not Everwood. It's so cheap and easy to record a DVD! Why the WB people don't let us buy this terrific as real as it can be serie?
0679809015|5.0|My 10 month old daughter loves this book and other flap books like it.  She'll dig through her toys to find them and spends much time going from page to page opening and closing the flaps!   <br /> <br />Great for fostering a love for books and reading! <br /> <br />I'll be buying more flap books like this one!
B00005JP87|2.0|The concept of this movie is quite endearing; magic and romance with a classic villain and curious twists that keep the audience wondering.  But it is poorly executed, and just doesn't work as well as it could.<br /><br />The first annoyance is the overuse of soft focus.  It's the past - there's magic involved - we get it!  The cinematography seems very obvious and overdone with an attempt to be \\"artsy\\" that simply falls flat and looks ridiculous.  But this is beside the point of the film itself.<br /><br />While the acting is not bad, there's no real connection with the characters.  Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are both fine actors who feel awkward with such unimaginative scenes and situations.  Whatever her name is - the girl - just isn't the greatest actress and there are really only a few moments where there's any chemisty between her and the lead.<br /><br />But without spoling the plot or getting too detailed because I'm getting tired, it suffices to say that this movie is just plain boring at times.  Sure you're interested in how the illusions work and if it's really magic and if they'll end up together and blah blah blah, but it fails to be truly captivating.  I wasn't buying into it most of the time.  No matter how bad a movie is, if it's entertaining and engages the audience, it's at least doing its job.  I was simply bored with this.  Not all of the time, and I paid attention to all of it, but it just falls flat.  Not great.  But, you know, not bad either.  I give it a 2.5, or \\"meh\\" rating.
B000002HO3|5.0|I heard a lot of these songs at my place of employment over the satellite feed. I just realized that frontman Mick Hucknall has a voice like Jefferson Airplane/Starship's Marty Balin. IF YOU DON'T KNOW ME BY NOW is an excellent cover that was made famous by Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes in 1972. HOLDING BACK THE YEARS is somewhat jazzy(I heard it before on jazz stations). MONEY'S TOO TIGHT TO MENTION is awesome. STARS is pretty cool also. When I first heard FOR YOUR BABIES,I thought it was Balin singing. That's why I said he and Hucknall are soundalikes. The other songs are great!
B000003C2U|5.0|This album was the real start of Chuck's progression away from the straight ahead death metal found on some of his earlier works. Make no mistake this album is fast and heavy as hell. Songs like See Through Dreams, Suicide Machine, and my favorite Lack Of Comprehension are classic Death songs. This album made me buy Cynic's beautiful but ultimately inferior album Focus because of Sean Reinert and Paul Masvidal's playing on this album. The greatest bass player in the world, Steve DiGiorgio is also found on this album, yet he is not as noticealbe as he would be on Individual Thought Patterns or with Control Denied. This album is a bit different than the last three Death albums sticking more towards a more thrashy sound than those later albums. Perfect musicianship and the lyrics are really thoughtful especially See Through Dreams and Suicide Machine. Pick this one up! Also a reviewer by the name of Lobster Leno has been posting absurd comments on many Death and Slayer album reviews. This guy needs to be shot in the head. He reccomends Limp (Dick) Bizkit and Ashlee (Milli Vanilli) Simpson. Punch him in the face.
0843176881|5.0|The electrifying opening of Mr. Sneeze smash-cuts into the Land of Mr. Men.<br /><br />One of the more harrowing sections is when Mr. Sneeze accepts he will always sneeze.<br /><br />The rage-fueled memoir is kept in check by Mr. Sneeze's cool, minimalist style. The book could have benefited from being a bit leaner. Nearly 40 pages is a long time to spend under Mr. Sneeze.  His style may seem too self-conscious for some readers, but beyond the literary fireworks lurks a fierce debut.<br /><br />This review owes a great deal to Amazon's review of James Frey's debut memoir, A Million Little Pieces,
078401213X|1.0|This film is based on a concept that has potential - a mathematical key to the interconnectedness of all things - but it doesn't deliver.  Clearly, the writer wants us to believe that there is one elusive key to the intriguing patterns all around us, but he pretty much drops the ball right there.  Usually with this sort of plot, you are at least given the illusion that *someone* knows the answer and what's more has some clue about what to do with it as well.  There's no such suspension of disbelief in this one, nor even an attempt at such.   <br /> <br />Adding injury (if you count eye strain) to insult, the whole thing is shot in grainy B&W with annoying MTV-style jump cuts.  In the awards for Obnoxious Splash Films of the Year, this one takes the cake, but not the Pi.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|I never thought I'd be one to give this movie a bad review, because I usually love everything. But it is true, the movie just boring. From the trailers, the movie looks to be a really creepy and a very good game movie, but it just turns out to be slow and some what confusing.<br /><br />Indeed, they did a good job at having the right mosters and special effects, but the story itself is just so dull. Everyone I was with, including myself, was ready to leave after the first hour. It has a bad problem of dragging, the movie just seems to go on and on and on. It felt like it went on about 30 minutes too long.<br /><br />The acting is great for the script that they have, and some actors that I really enjoy. Sean Bean was great as the husband, but his role could have been played by anyone. They just didn't take him to his full advantage, but for as long as he was on, he was great. Being a Trek fan, I was happy to see the villain was played by actrees Alice Krige, who is the Borg Queen on Star Trek First Contact and Voyager.<br /><br />But like I said, the special effects are good. Not really great, some parts could have been better but it was enjoyable. For those who have never played the games may be confused by some of the things going on. Even I found myself confused in some places. Overall, the movie has good special effects and great actors/actresses, but it really lacks in story and is nothing but dull and confusing.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|My first listen of Modern Times brought some doubt, so I had to listen to it another 30 times. In fact it is the only cd I've listened to since it arrived some days ago. Please forgive me I'm slow sometimes. This cd is so rich, both in music and lyric. It almost sounds as if it is coming out of the old Victrola. \\"Thunder On The Mountain,\\" \\"Someday Baby\\" and \\"Rollin' and Tumblin\\" could make a man with a cane dance, while \\"When The Deal Goes Down,\\" \\"Workingman's Blues #2\\" and \\"Nettie Moore\\" are soulful and wonderful, bringing a tear to the eye. Simply put, this is a great album and any review less than 4 stars is simply nonsense. This is art. <br /> <br />I can remember seeing Bob Dylan in Chicago many years ago and thinking it was the worst concert I ever saw him do. The sound was bad and hard to make out. A friend invited me to a concert near Detroit the following week. From the first progression of chords to the last no one sat down. To this day it remains the most powerful music experience I have witnessed.  <br /> <br />I can't think of another artist who I have watched in such constant motion of creativity and change and I am awed by this man's creative genius. I am truly thankful to have been able to witness it.  <br /> <br />Like listening to Dylan on recording or seeing him live, I continue to listen over and over and over... Something tells me whether it be Chicago or Detroit, I have learned to appreciate  good art when I hear it.  \\"Modern Times\\" is good art!!
B000000OA6|5.0|With this  fine recording in 90's, Queen reached again their peakest moment almost like in 1975. Listening to this record one can listen and find the structure and essence of the outstanding \\"A Night At The Opera\\" album. It's evident that the structure and rules of \\"A Night..\\" are here, but with a different and more modern application, plus with all the operatic mock Opera stuff for what Queen was always identificated: We can find all this similarities over and over as the music goes...and we can interpret it as follows (please listen the time signatures, chord changes, tones and tempos; and the creative, and not so obvious, use of the spanish mixolydian mode on chord changes and solos(*), or the chromatic ascending/decending chord changes (+), etc.):<br /><br />1. \\"Innuendo\\"* (Bohemian Rhapsody*+), 3. \\"Ride The Wild Wind\\" (I'm In Love With My Car*), 4. \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\" (You're My Best Friend), 5. \\"Headlong\\" or \\"Hitman\\"  (Sweet Lady), 6. \\"I Can't Live With You\\" (Death On Two Legs*+), 7. \\"Don't Try So Hard\\" (Love Of My Life), 8. \\"Show Must Go On\\"*+ (Death In Two Legs*+), 9. \\"All God's People\\" (The Prophet'Song+), 10. \\"Bijou\\" (God Save The Queen).<br /><br />Brilliant songs like \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\"(*) or \\"Delilah\\" were out of the \\"A Night...\\" format and context, as same as songs like '39 (Folk), Good Company (Dixieland Jazz Band format) or Seaside Rendesvouz (Old english salad days)were out of INNUENDO for obvious reasons.<br /><br />As anything that we could think, Freddie's voice was as stronger and high than in the 70's, but with a fantastic rought tone inflexion that gives a powerfull dramatic flavor in every song of INNUENDO. Something interesting about this recording is that the song \\"Show Must Go On\\" presents three vocal lines with the same pasion and quality that the song \\"How Can I Go On\\" from the Mercury solo CD: BARCELONA...(listen both, please)<br /><br />\\"How Can I Go On\\" (1988):<br />Is anybody there to believe in me<br />to hear my plea and take care of me?<br /><br />\\"Show Must Go On\\" (1991):<br />1. On and On, does anybody know what we're looking for...<br />2. Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore.<br />3. On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?<br /><br />It obvious that in 1988, Freddie was worried about his health situation, and in 1991 he was overwhelmed with life questions. But in the end he was very humble and accepted the end of his life... Listen this extraordinary crown jewel recording, that open the nineties for Queen and rules forever!...

0156027321|3.0|Although the description of the plot did not entice me, this book has many deep, spiritual issues presented in it.  The ending through we for a total loop and made me think, \\"What really occured here?\\"  I like Pi's adoption of multiple, totally different religions in the beginning of the book.  How a young adult could take aspects from all of the different religions and not realize he had to only stick to one type of practice. <br /> <br />However the plot is rather boring and what is to be gained from this novel is the spiritual guidance.  I wouldn't say it leans towards one religion more than another, rather the discussion of life, our purpose and how we choose to pass the time when faced with few choices.
B0000399WC|3.0|Steve Mcqueen's brightest moment was playing Henri 'Papillon' Charriere in the remake of the book of Charriere's experience as a prisoner of the French Penal Colony. \\"Papi\\" endures a lot of mental and physical hardships mostly due to his persistency to escape and find freedom. In an epic adventure landing him in impossible and remote areas, Papi never loses his marbles (completely) and stays the course. With Dustin Hoffman co-starring as Dega, he adds a nice comic relief in serious situations. The two manage to survive and their last scene is one the most memorable in Hollywood history.<br /><br />A long, long adventure, but certainly worth watching.
068484267X|5.0|Excellent story of how a child presented with such poverty and misfortune manages to work himself towards the dream of a better life in America.  The novel touches upon the religion, poverty and alcohol issues prevalent in the irish working class of Limerick.  Also covers themes such as \\"pulling yourself up by the bootstraps\\".  The character Angela frustrated me in her poor choices but then I think she never recovered from the tramatic tradgedies presented to her in the beginning of the novel.  So maybe she become numb to her decisions later on in life.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|I often question how composers such as John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Howard Shore, etc., can continue to produce extraordinary, original music year round.  The only answer I can come up with is--genius and emotion.  This soundtrack is pure genius and swells with emotion.  I don't think I have heard such a dark, emotional soundtrack in years.  The soundtrack clearly outshines the movie, which can't be blamed on Zimmer.  I am sure Zimmer was writing for the book and the movie simultaneously.  Zimmer does not often build his soundtracks on the backs of the orchestra or choir, but when he does it is simply amazing.  It's not often that a composer can make an instrument cry, and trust me when I say this, instruments are crying on this one.  Additionally, Zimmer accompanies the work with a piano.  If the soundtrack were to have others that it might borrow from in Zimmer's collection, I would say a mix between Batman Begins and Hannibal; a much more mature and serious rendition so to speak.  Again, simply amazing.   <br /> <br />Hans Zimmer is quoted as saying, he has not put as much work in recent years into scoring a movie as he has with the Da Vinci Code.  And what pains me is that people constantly attempt to give other people credit for his work.  If credit is due to other people, then credit would have been given.  On the inside CD cover, Ron Howard (the director), does not cite and give praise to Graham Preskett or Richard Harvey, but instead lauds Zimmer for his work and creativity, and cites him as being one of the best in the industry at what he does, and I think it is wrong for individuals to publicly attempt to dish out credit under false pretences.  Hans Zimmer composed the soundtrack, where his name is the only to appear on the cover.  If I am correct, only one track was not composed by Zimmer and that was track 14 (Kyrie for the Magdalene), and yes, others did CO-compose on some of the other tracks by mostly adding words to the vocals or very limited orchestral composition.  And for a fact, track number 13, one of the best tracks on the album, was composed by Hans Zimmer and Hans Zimmer only (watch the interviews with Zimmer and Howard and how track 13 was developed).  There is no clear departure from Zimmer's normal work on this album, simply listen to The Last Samurai or Hannibal and an unknowing individual would say the same. <br />
006072448X|1.0|\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" pretends to be a look into the psycology of a teenage mass murderer, but it's really a low-rent Steven King horror story.  Too long by at least twice, the book hinges on a plot device that would have made a great short story but isn't enough to sustain it.  The characters are unconvincing cardboard cutouts, and the nerosis and narcismism of the mother so suffocating I found myself wishing he had killed her instead and spared us all this drivel.

If your curious like I was then you'll have to listen for yourself, hopefully a friend has the CD so that you can borrow it b4 u find out how much it s%cks.
B00005JNQA|4.0|If you enjoy movies that focus on world social issues, then you may like this movie. It is more than just a thriller. It explores the idea of fighting for peace and what can happen when it doesn't work. This movie is more for the intellectual type of person.
0385504209|1.0|This book is a masterpiece of poorly written scribble. I cannot understand how this book sold so many copies. The only guess I can venture is that American's watch too much tv and are unaware of any decent literature. I really can't understand what our schools must be teaching if this is what the American people find enjoyable. Brown has outdone himself in his shaky understanding of religion. I thought his physics and religion references in Angels and Demons were bad, but this is an insult to the intellect!

B000GRTQSE|4.0|Bob Dylan, one of rock music biggest icons now aged 65, continues to blaze the trail after his 1997 \\"Times Out of Mind\\" and 2001 \\"Love & Theft\\" albums. After a 5 year hiatus (his longest between studio albums ever), now comes the long-awaited new album.<br /><br />\\"Modern Times\\" (10 tracks, 62 min.) continues the trail of \\"Love and Theft\\", bringing early-Americana, bluesey and even jazzy tracks, to great effect. The opener \\"Thunder on the Mountains\\" sets the table. Other outstainding tracks include \\"Rollin' and Thumblin'\\", similar in sound to \\"Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum\\", \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\" (with earily similar lines to the Led Zep song \\"When The Levee Breaks\\") and the 9 min. closer \\"Ain't Talkin'\\". This is a great album, if a bit overlong at 62 min., but lacking the element of surprise of \\"Love and Theft\\", which was one of 2001's top albums of the year in my book. Dylan has gladly shaken the burden of being \\"the consciesness of the 60s era\\" (which he has made clear since then he never wanted to be in the first place) and he has gone on and do his own thing, regardless of public opinion. This great album simply reinforces that point. This is Dylan doing his thing, at age 65, blazing the trail yet again and bringing us great music, his way.<br /><br />Finally as to the DVD, it brings a mere 4 live songs (Cold Irons Bound, Blood In My Eyes, Things Have Changed, Love Sick). For the privilege of having about 20 minutes worth of Dylan live on DVD, the purchase pruce goes from $9.99 for the regular edition to a whopping $22.99. For die-hards only.<br /><br />Dylan continues to tour the \\"Never Ending Tour\\", and we caught him a few weeks ago on his annual summer tour of minor league baseball parks. Even though this was very close to the release of \\"Modern Times\\", I was very surprised he did not play a single song from the upcoming album. But it was a great show, and it was my 16 yr. old daughter's first time seeing him in concert (and she liked it), and it just brings the point home that Dylan is timeless and his art will skip from generation to generation.lan is timeless and his art will skip from generation to generation.
B000GW8RX4|4.0|For the most part this is a concert that rivals anything else now available from the 70's. Great vocals and great playing are heard throughout. It is a short set list however and all songs are stretched out with solos. This works well enough until you get to the drum solo in Still I'm Sad. Under the \\"it seemed like a good idea at the time\\" category you can hear Cozy play along to a tape of Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture finale. Unbelievable is the best you can say about that. But the only real miscue is Blackmore's little psycho/ego drama after the show is over and he's left on stage alone. Seriously, what does guitar smashing have to do with anything? But otherwise this is a great show and we already see glimpses of his future musical direction when he plays Greensleeves and bits of Bach, Beethoven and Gounod.
B000E97X66|3.0|(I meant to give 5 stars... now it won't let me correct that.)<br /><br />There are some particular rock moments in time that have taken theor place in the pantheon of rock history, and which finally in recent years are becoming more and more available. Bob Dylan's \\"Judas\\" show in Manchester, England in May, 1966 is a prime example of those. Bruce Springsteen's show in London in November, 1975 is another one, and this show now is finally available on CD. This is the soundtrack to the DVD that was included in the \\"Born to Run\\" 30th Anniversary Edition release from last Fall.<br /><br />\\"Hammersmith Odeon, London '75\\" (2CDs, 16 tracks, 125 min.) brings the Novmber 18, 1975 show in its entirety. Obviously the focus is on the then-just released \\"Born to Run\\" album (all but one of its tracks are performed). The highlights are many, but for me personally they include \\"Spirit in the Night\\", a 12+ min. \\"E Street Shuffle\\" (with a snippet from Sam Cooke's \\"Having a Party\\"), a truly epic \\"Kitty's Back\\" (with a wink to Van Morrison's \\"Moondance\\"), \\"Rosalita\\", and \\"Detroit Medley\\". You can feel the intensity and fervor of the band's playing throughout the entire set.<br /><br />The remastered sound is nothing short of spectecular. What really amazes me is that, as Springsteen writes in the album's liner notes, he had been sitting on these tapes for almost 30 years and he had not listened to them at all untill the end of the \\"Rising\\" tour. Wow... In any event, the release of this fabulous and historic show has long been overdue. There is no excuse not to buy this, whether you are a Spingsteen fan or whether you just appreciate standout music.

B000ASATWQ|5.0|The lyricist Damian Marley reminds me of a reggae version of Nas or Pac. The lyrical content is extraordinary. Please read the actual lyrics in the inside cover. It will make you appreciate the album even more. It is beyond \\"teenie bopper\\" club dub or radio music. It is conscious rebel music. It is intelligent. For people with something on their minds. One song, he keeps rhyming the same word for like 20 bars. A style like that takes talent. He has a definite M.C. influence.<br /><br />This album is a must have.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|I like to deciate this movie review of Chicken Little to Don Knotts who sadly passed away earlier this year, and he leaves up by provding voice work in Chicken Little. Last year Disney added this movie to thier long list of Disney animated movie, and with this one, I mean the movie is cute like the others that came out this decade, but will they ever live up to the classic Disney animated movies? But if you liked the newer Disney animated movies you might like this, even through this was panned by the movie critics, don't listen to them, what do they know? But it does seem to me that they are around to try to save us from spending money on movies they deemed to be bad.  <br /> <br />The movie beings with Chicken Little (Zach Braff) ringing the bell on top of a school, and all the town's residents comes running, where he warns them that the shy is falling, and of course they don't believe him, and his father Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall) doesn't believe hikm either, and advises the town residents that his son was hit on the head by a acorn. And he advises his son to lay low. A year later he is still the laughing stock of the town, and a new movie called Crazy Little Chicken is set to open in the nearest movie theatre. His pals are Fish out of Water (Dan Molina), Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn) and Abby Mallard aka the Ugly Duckling (Joan Cusack). And there is a neighborhood bully named Foxy Loxy (Amy Sedaris). He gets in trouble at school, and his father is called in, and in the hallway listening through the bit open door, Chicken Little learns that his dad was the town's star in baseball, which Chicken Little wants to make his father proud of him, which gets him the idea of askiung his father to sign up for baseball. And even becomes the hero of a ballgame, when he coach advises him to not swing the bat, and walk, but on 0-2 pitches, he gets a hit, and being surpised, goes around the bases while the outfielders are having trouble with the ball. The mange to get the ball, and throw to homeplate, when it looks like he is out, the umpire dusks off homeplate, to find Chicken Little's foot on homeplate, and chages the call to safe, and that is the winning run in a 15-14 game. And shortly after that he is hit again for real by a peice of a space ship, that falls in the house, and in his room and hits him on the head. He doesn't tell his father, but gets his friends out of a karaoke party, and he tells him, and next thing they know the fish out of the water is taken prisoner, and well I am not going to revel what will happen next, I think I have given away enough already.  <br /> <br />In Loving Memory  <br /> <br />Don Knotts  <br />July 21, 1924-Febuary 24 2006
B0000797IO|2.0|If Jennifer Aniston's \\"Friends\\" character Rachel Greene ever had a weird dream I could imagine it to be just like this black comedy- a minimum-waged, woman's variation of \\"The Graduate.\\"  But just like Rachel, I'd probably shake it off as a weird time spent in the twilight zone.    \\"The Good Girl\\" would have us believe that somewhere in the middle of nowhere, U.S.A. Aniston is a frustrated 30 year old sales clerk in a mythical \\"K-Martesque\\" store called the \\"Retail Rodeo.\\" Her name, pun intended, Justine Last. As we can deduce from Aniston's off screen monologue (which she reads in a Forest Gump-ish, \\"Id-like-to-be-profound, but-I-just=got hit-by-a=baseball-bat\\" kid of sound), she feels trapped just like all the seemingly robots around her.  Married to a pot-headed, dim bulb of a husband (the wonderful John C. Reilly), Last yearns to be rescued and believes she's finds her shining knight in the person of an introverted but passionate younger man named Holden Worther(Jake Gyllenhaal).  The sex is great, of course, and before Last can bask in her newfound sense of freedom and hope for a better life she must contend with a major problem- Holden is a lovesick loon.     From there on director Miguel Arteta and writer Mike White turn the tables on our own expectations for finding love in odd places .  No last minute romantic rescues here for \\"The Good Girl\\" is ultimately a cynical, extramarital version of the movie \\"A Simple Plan\\" where one misdeed leads comically (or tragically) to another.      It's all game for part of the way but ultimately the \\"Good Girl\\", for me, rings false.   It's another condescending, Hollywood take on life in \\"fly-over land\\" as a fate worse than death.  All the characters are made to speak a beat slower and drag around their surroundings as if they were zombies from the movie \\"Dawn of the Dead.\\" Further proof of the filmmakers blue state status are depicted by having Gyllenhaal's parents act like the subjects in the painting \\"American Gothic.\\"They're two  silent, moronic centurions.       Aniston, despite raves from major critics, seems too sitcom spunky and creamy-complected for the low-rent heroine.  Her home style accent comes and goes while Gyllenhaal's hair looks as if it was styled somewhere on Rodeo Drive. The movie's one bright spot is Zooey Deschanel as Aniston's morose co-worker.  A funny riff she repeated in the movie \\"Failure To Launch.\\"  Wake up, Rachel!  Wake up!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Science-Fiction + Old West + Great Writing + Great Acting = Firefly <br /> <br />I became a fan when I watched the movie Serenity in theaters. I had never watched Firefly before, but I was captivated by the world that the movie presented. The humor and wit of the movie compelled me to try out the show it was based on. Well, I bought the DVD set, and I watched it by myself. Then, I watched it with my cousin. Then I watched it with my sister. Then I watched it with my youth minister. And now, I watch it whenever I'm bored and want to spend a few hours enjoying greatness. I've come to love this show more than any other of any genre. <br /> <br />I am a very big fan of shows such as Alias and Lost, but when I compare them to Firefly, they're not even close. I wish there was more of Firefly, and it saddens me that it only lasted 14 episodes. However, those 14 episodes are golden. It mistifies me how a network could cancel such a show, but I suppose all good things must come to an end. That said, Firefly is not done. I believe it will return at least once more, whether it be in movie form again or in a series. <br /> <br />Whichever, I know I will be there watching, because it is too good to pass up. If you've never seen it, you should give it a try. I promise you won't be disappointed. Nothing's really comparably to Firefly. <br /> <br />Truly great shows are rare, and Firefly is the cream of the crop. I highly suggest it.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Reese you did June Carter Cash proud. Her voice sounded so naturally country you would swere it was June herself singing. As far as Phoniex's performance as Johnny Cash he was amazing he was able to show the serious side of a performer that not many of his fans saw.  He is legend in his own time one that surely will not be forgotten after seeing these two compeling performances.  Oscar worthy for Reese.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|For a brief time, fans rejoiced when they first heard that the original Star Wars trilogy would finally be available on DVD without any added alterations.  Yes, finally we would have on DVD the movie trilogy that inspired generations, including the first film that had no episode number and Han shooting first.  But, as George Lucas would have it, the original films are here, but they're in non-anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 2.0; something which you would expect films of this magnitude not to be, but then you must remember, this is George Lucas, and this is Star Wars, and the man will milk it every which way he can.  As a previous reviewer had already stated, with the trilogy already available on DVD and these upcoming releases due out soon, it won't be too long before another set is released containing all six films, with the original trilogy in anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 5.1.  You know it will happen, and you know that these editions are NOT worth picking up.  If you already own the first release of the films on DVD, don't be duped again, and if you don't, don't pick any of these films up.  Wait until they get re-re-released again (it'll happen, you know it), and maybe, just maybe, the original films that we grew up loving will finally make their way onto DVD the way they should be.
B000GRUMPU|2.0|Take it from a big fan of disaster movies, AVOID this mess.  The script is poorly written, the charcters are protrayed as morons. Visual effects are only fair, this was a waste of film time and the money it cost to produce the entire piece of poorly written and acted cinema.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|The visual creativity of this movie is terrific. There are scenes that are almost inspired in their eery feel and imaginitive creepiness. But you can't make a movie with just this. You need a story and this movie just doesn't have one.  Compare this movie to the Alien Movies where the special effects were also inspired and something to talk about but the special effects were the supporting cast to a great story. In this movie the special effects are the main star and it just doesn't make for a good movie. A good video game yes, but movie no.
B000FL7CAK|1.0|The first season of \\"Veronica Mars\\" was refreshingly free of politically correct cant.  The second season continues the first season's fine acting and production values, but the scripts, alas, are much more conventionally \\"Hollywood\\" than those of the first season.  Race, class, religion and sex get the standard Left Coast treatment; there is even an inept homage to \\"Twelve Angry Men\\" in which wise Hispanic and black jurors (and, needless to say, Veronica) overcome prejudiced middle-class whites.  The lowest blow is the depiction of Meg Manning's Christian parents.  I'm only halfway through Season 2 on DVD, but I half expect it will turn out that the Mannings blew up the bus.  Of course, in Hollywood's view, to be a believing Christian is per se to be a neurotic, sexually repressed, child-abusing, life-hating menace.  And guess what, that's what Meg's parents are!  They lock their youngest daughter in a closet after making her write \\"The path to God is paved with righteousness\\" hundreds of times. (How these folks raised such a nice girl as Meg is unclear.)  In typical fashion, these characters are never described as \\"Christians,\\" only as \\"religious.\\"  Hollywood is arrogant but not courageous; it likes plausible deniability.  But the Mannings show little resemblance to Jews or Muslims; it's not hard to guess the precise nature of their \\"religiosity\\".  I hope, when he's a bit older, to watch this show with my son, and explain how it illustrates the bigotry and prejudice with which those of our faith are depicted by the Rob Thomases of the world.  Then perhaps I'll also explain to him how the path to God is indeed paved with righteousness, both Christ's and (imperfectly) ours.  Take that, Veronica Mars.
B000FS9FC6|3.0|I have a weakness for movies where the hero quotes shakespeare and does it well. In this movie this is true. Shakespeare is well quoted but my quote for this movie is also from Shakespeare \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\"<br /><br />Natalie Portman proves herself a capable actress. She has shed the stigma of child star with mature performances like in this movie or in Closer but she couldn't save this movie.<br /><br />Even though the script is very well written, the acting is good, and the story moves along well the whole thing is just lacklustre. It's just another \\"Be suspicious of Big Brother\\" movie. And it's been done before and it's been done better. And it was done better even way back in the 70's with George Lucas' THX 1138 and Logan's Run. It just didn't bring a new look at the theme. I gave it three stars for being a well made movie but it goes no further than that because it doesn't offer anything new.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I like this newest film adaption of Jane Austen's classic \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  I won't rehash the plot here or where the movie differs from the novel, as numerious other reviews have already done so.  I think the movie is loyal to the novel where it counts, and that is the courtship of Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett.  Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen breath new life into the characters of Elizabeth and Darcy and they truly inhabit their respective roles.  I particularly liked Macfadyen's Darcy, as he seems much more feeling and would be the kind of person who would inspire the loyalty of his close friends and family as in the novel.  The supporting cast is also excellent and has some of the most beautiful women from accross the pond, including Rosamund Pike and the underused Kelly Reilly.  I highly recommend this fresh remake of \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"
B00005JOE8|3.0|it is as well that I am not familiar with the book this was adapted from as there is no danger of comparing the movie to it (be grateful).  see it for the sake of Weaving.  purchase it, gaps, blunders and all (remember all those thought provoking questions raised in the Matrix trilogy that were never answered?; well, brace yourself), because you're never going to read Jefferson anyway.
1400032717|4.0|What a sad, strange book. Christopher's stream-of-consciousness narration was unique to say the least (I liked how he jumped around from topic to topic, because organized writing can become quite a bore). While I don't see this as a study on autism, many autistic characteristics are displayed - most notably, the OCD. Can't have one sort of food touching another sort on his plate, can't eat anything yellow or brown, the rigid timetables, counting the cars, etc. Yet he is highly functional IF certain conditions are met:<br /><br />-no one touches him<br />-no crowds<br />-no loud noises<br />-there is order/if things make sense (he always appreciates order when he discovers it in new places, such as the train stops in intervals of 15 minutes)<br /><br />There are others, of course. But he's basically highly sensitive to his surroundings and cannot cope when strangers, touching, or unfamiliar situations get in the way of an otherwise peaceful existence consisting of his preferred white noise and solving math equations.  His mind can't process emotions correctly; instead, he reacts to negative emotions by screaming and moaning. He doesn't think highly of anyone besides himself and scientists. Thinks humans are just another animal, nothing special (but then, he wouldn't be special, and he thinks himself to be special, so that didn't quite add up). Reminded me of 9th grade biology class where we were learning about evolution. One girl, known for sarcastic remarks, raised her hand and said, \\"If evolution is real, why did it stop? Isn't there something better than humans?\\" Great question, and I can't even remember what the teacher said, probably because he couldn't think of an appropriate response that would be heard over the laughter of the class.<br /><br />Anyway, I found Christopher's dreams about being one of the only persons left on earth to be fascinating. He loves it because he can do anything - he can walk to the sea and it's raining and he can take ice cream from an abandoned shop and he can put on dry clothes at an abandoned house and, etc...(I wonder how many times \\"and\\" is used in that book!). He can do whatever he wants and no one bothers him.<br /><br />Christopher didn't like to imagine things in his head that weren't happening, and the above reference was of course referring to a dream, but when he would imagine himself as an astronaut, isn't that a lie? He could become an astronaut, but he isn't one yet. He would look down on regular people who imagined things that weren't real, and yet he finds no fault with himself for doing this. Just an inconsistency. I can seem him as an astronaut, however, and I think he would make an extraordinary scientist if all environmental conditions were met. It wouldn't be good to have a breakdown in a lab full of dangerous substances.<br /><br />I was quite angry to find out the truth about his mother, and his reaction was to be expected, I think, although if it had happened to a \\"normal\\" person, the repercussions would be longer lasting. How did this not destroy him? He is very fragile and though it's true that he hated his father and couldn't trust him for the rest of the book, it seems to me that he should hate his mother much more. She could have made more of an effort to see him, I think. Two years passed!! Perhaps she could have showed up at his school one day since his dad wouldn't have her at the house.<br /><br />Overall, a really intriguing book, and I loved the drawings (I used to make drawings of floor plans of my house, neighbors' houses, relatives' houses, and stores to put in my diaries when I was younger. I also made intricate schedules and cried if my schedule would be disrupted, but those are only mild OCD symptoms, nothing near Christopher's --it just made me understand him a little more. I also hated places with lots of people; I would run out and hide in the car after church, for example) and appreciated his math and science explanations..most of it made a lot of sense and was very educational.  I'll have to look up more about \\"The Case of the Cottingley Fairies\\" - those real life mysterious happenings are so interesting to me.<br /><br />Oh, Christopher..I'd like to see what you're like in twenty years.bout \\"The Case of the Cottingley Fairies\\" - those real life mysterious happenings are so interesting to me.

0784011176|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters in 93 and it has continued to haunt me ever since.  Watching it again last night, I realized once more what a wonderful movie it is--rich in symbolism, character, excellent acting, and a story so deep and beautiful it won't leave your brain.<br /><br />Many reviewers have given a plot synopsis but I want to talk about the way the piano itself is used in the movie.  It is a beautiful instrument and from the start of the movie we can see that Ada loves it.  We soon see why she is so attached to it--it is literally her voice since she has not spoken since the age of 6. When she and her daughter are dumped on the shores of New Zealand, her new husband refuses to acknowlege her need to have the piano with her.  He leaves it behind despite her pleas that they take it rather than her clothes or household goods.  There is a very poingnanant scene with Ada standing on a cliff and looking out to the beach at the piano with such longing in her eyes.  It is clear she is leaving a part of herself behind--perhaps the most important part and yet her oaf of a husband completely misses it.<br /><br />It is Bains, the neighbor and friend of Ada's husband who finally grasps the significance of the piano. At Ada's insistance, he takes her and her daughter back to the beach so she can play her beloved piano and 'speak' for the first time in days.  You can see by the way her face lightens from the harsh mask it has been through most of the movie so far how much this means to Ada.  She actually smiles and her movments lose their stiffness and become flowing as she lets the music move through her, saying things impossible to express through words.  Bains displays a quality here that Ada's husband has little of--patience. He stays on the beach and listens to Ada play most of the day.  There is another interesting piece of symbolism at the end of this scene where Ada walks in the wet sand, leaving her footprints behind.  Her daughter runs to join her, walking in the same set of footprints and after a moment's hesitation, Bains also follows, adding his footprints to hers and making the track a single one--forshadowing the end of the film in which the three of them will form a family.<br /><br />After hearing Ada play, Bains is captivated by her.  He arranges with her lunk of a husband to buy the piano and Ada is forced to give him lessons.  At first she has nothing but contempt for Bains whom she considers ignorant because he can't read but after they strike their bargain--1 black key on the piano keyboard for one sexual favor in order for Ada to earn her piano back--she gradually begins to see him in another light.<br /><br />Much has been made in other reviews of the fact that Bains proposes such a bargain to Ada in the first place.  But this is not the act of a man bent solely on gratuitous sexual gratification--rather it is the only way Bains can think of to make Ada his--to bring the elusive and aloof woman down to his level so he can love her and give her a chance to love him.  Throughout the movie it is clear that Bains is deeply moved by every aspect of Ada--the way she looks, the way she expresses herself through music, the play of muscles under her skin as she 'speaks' through the piano, even her scent.  And it is clear that he understands the significance of the piano because he treats it as an extension of Ada herself.  In one evocative scene, he takes off his clothes and uses them to polish the richly carved wood of the instrument after Ada has gone.  He touches the piano with reverence and love, using the same gestures that he later uses with Ada herself when he caresses her body.<br /><br />I must digress here to say that many reviewers have commented on the full frontal nudity of both Ada (Holly Hunter) and Bains (Harvey Keitel) in the movie.  Some people seem to think it is gratuitous but I really liked it because I felt it added to the symbolic quality of the film.  Bains looks like you might expect a New Zealand farmer to look--his body is hard and deeply tanned from working in the sun--he is everything that is rough and rugged and masculine.  In contrast, Ada is pale and fragile looking--everything soft and feminine and when she does finally yield to Bains with her whole heart, the differnces between them combine to make a deeply sensual scene.<br /><br />It is in the love scene that we first see the beginning of the end of the piano.  Ada, who hasn't spoken a word out loud since she was 6, says something we can't quite catch while she and Bains are making love.  Bains doesn't quite catch it either but he urges her to 'whisper it' in his ear which she does.  Now that Bains has unlocked her voice, we can see that the piano is going to become obsolete. And in fact, at the end of the film when she and her daughter are leaving via canoe with Bains, Ada orders that it be pushed overboard.  The piano now symbolizes her old life, a life she wants to leave behind forever. But it almost takes her with it--she nearly drowns with her piano when her foot catches in the ropes that bind it.  She struggles free at the last moment as much to her own surprise.  She is surprised that her will has chosen to live rather than to die with the piano which now symbolises the stagnant life she is leaving behind.<br /><br />At the end of the film we see Ada learning to speak.  Though she still plays the piano, it is no longer her sole means of communication. She has grown from a cold, silent woman to a warm and loving one, the change fostered by Bains' love and understanding. He has helped her find her true voice and let go of her past though in her dreams she still sees herself tied to the piano which rests at the bottom of the ocean.  Perhaps she sees the part of herself she had to leave behind in order to grow and find true happiness and self fulfillment.<br /><br />The Piano is a moving and beautiful film, one of my top five favorties of all time.  I can't say enough about this lovely movie. Rent or buy it today and see what I mean.oks like you might expect a New Zealand farmer to look--his body is hard and deeply tanned from working in the sun--he is everything that is rough and rugged and masculine.

With this album comes a DVD with THE MAKING OF A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH, THE REINCARNATION OF BENJAMIN BREEG VIDEO, STUDIO PERFORMANCE FOOTAGE OF DIFFERENT WORLD, AND AN AWESOME PHOTO GALLERY! The DVD is about an hour long and the CD is around an hour and ten minutes long-not bad for the price.  Rush to BEST BUY right now and get all this for $9.99! If not, order it now.  I gave it 4 stars just because it does have a few slow songs on it but they are even good in there own way! UP THE IRONS AND PLAY IT LOUD!!!!!!
B000ENV2PU|5.0|This remastered ultimate special edition is a great buy.  I find Depeche Mode to be one of my favorite bands and cd's like this bolster that point of view with greater intensity.  The sound quality of the remastering and the addition of songs that some people may have never heard are fantastic!  Plus, the dvd of interviews and past performances on tv shows and such is amusing, it's great to see how the guys were at different points in their career.  If you enjoy this one the other remasters are just as fun with the same set of features such as extra songs and dvd documentaries.  I highly recommend this and the other remaster!
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Eli Roth's \\"Hostel\\" tries hard to be a genius in the horror genre but succeeds only in being a vile, empty excuse to showcase as much gore and nudity as possible.  The basic plotline is pure Horror Moviemaking 101.  Group of young people (in this case, 3 college age guys) outside their normal environment (in this case, backpacking thru Europe)who stumble upon some kind of horror (in this case, a hostel that finds victims for demented persons willing to pay to abuse, mutilate and kill strangers).  It goes wrong from the very beginning.  The college age guys are anything but sympathetic.  They are presented as mindless, stoned horndogs who only want to ingest drugs and get laid.  There is nothing redeeming about them.  The first 30 minutes or so of the movie is nothing more than these same unsympathetic guys in a variety of sex acts.  The nudity and sexuality gets repetitive and old. The movie is indeed full of graphic violence and horror - - even after having seen my share of some pretty scary and even gruesome movies, I could barely watch some scenes in \\"Hostel\\".    But \\"Hostel\\" leaves you feeling almost as demented and empty as the killer.  The movie seems so black, so souless that I felt as though I needed a shower after watching it.  It definitely makes people out to be incredibly cruel and cold toward one another.   I would not recommend this movie in general.  I just couldn't find too much that was redeeming about it.
B00003CXAE|5.0|The movie version of \\"Grease\\" is the perfect summer movie, light,breezy,cheerful and maybe just a tad too squeeky clean for its'own good.  The original Broadway show took place in 1972 and was the 10 year reunion of the class of Rydell High.  The alumni do an extended sketch to show how they were in 1962.  This concept neatly explains the advanced ages of the players.    The movie played it as a straight teenage musical and the Pink Ladies and the Burger Palace Boys(the boy gang original name) were all portrayed by actors well into their twenties with the exception of Stockard Channing who was uncomfortably nearing 40.    This explains why the critics originally were luke-warm or knocked the film.(The age problem) but the critics on Broadway wern't kind either-it was the audiences that loved it.  The original show was also heavily laced with obscenities, mostly the f-bomb, which made perfect sense since the story was about a group of kids in their own little cliques who were trying to act tough and cool. The big joke was that beneath the thuggish and slutty behavior and potty mouths these wannabe juvenile delinquents were really nice-just adolescents starting to flex their wings. Another important difference between the original show was Rydell High was an inner-city midwestern school, and the movie version of the school was located somewhere in sunny California, probably Malibu.        Each subsequent stage version of \\"Grease\\" has been sanitized like the movie and while that doesn't detract from the high energy fun it loses the high energy but grit of the original.    The movie though was loaded with a slew of goodies--the peaches and cream beauty of Olivia Newton John, John Travolta in his prime and some well staged musical numbers including the \\"Born To Hand-Jive\\" prom number, \\"Beauty School Dropout\\" \\"Summer Nights\\" \\"We Go Together\\"(the original stage version of \\"We Go Together\\" was sexually explicit and you wouldn't believe what was going on during the refrain,Boogie Boogie,Booglia etc) and \\"Greased Lightnin\\" which surprisingly retains the racy lyrics from the 1972 show considering the almost simon-pure innocense of the rest of the movie.    I am only pointing out the difference in tone and attitude of the original from the movie but I enjoyed the film in 1978 and I still enjoy it in 2006 but it is just not the same as it was in 1972 and wowed audiences on Broadway for over eight years.    So this movie is still a great watch on a \\"Summer Night\\".
B00005JNS0|5.0|I loved it.  My nine year old daughter loved it.  The characters and cameos and their tie-ins with the car models selected are just fabulous.  A nice story line.  Who cares if it's somewhat predictable.  Almost all movies are predicabtle.  That's not the point.  Will be buying this one for sure.

B0000214F0|4.0|Once I got past the shock-value, I thought this movie was very daring, for its time. The actors are well-chosen and talented, to be sure, but at times, I found their performances to be somewhat wooden. <br /> <br />I would definitely not let anyone under 18 watch this movie; even so, I'd say the unrated version was the best way to see thie movie. When everything gets thrown at you (and then some!), you're less likely to be squeamish about less-explicit material. Numbing? Perhaps.

At a time when sets were common, this movie was filmed entirely on location. The desert scenes are all real. I believe the interiors were all real buildings, though I can not verify that. The music, most especially the theme, is unbelievable. The soaring violins are well matched to the expansive desert vistas, stretching away into infinity. The Arabian deserts are as immense as the American west. Also important were the costumes, which were highly detailed and apparently authentic. Each and every aspect of this movie was so exceedingly well executed that it approaches perfection. In one of the DVD extras Peter O'Toole mentions that he was expecting to be filming this movie for five months, and instead ended up filming it for two years and three months, one indication of the care and complexity required to create this film.<br /><br />If you have yet to buy this movie, then please do two things. First, if at all possible for your region, buy the two-disk DVD with the marvelous extras. The black and white documentaries are short but interesting. The interviews provide insight into those involved with the film. Second, buy the biggest television set you possibly can, and be sure you watch this movie in wide screen format. You miss too much with full screen. In fact, the optimal way to watch this movie is to have a surround sound system and an HDTV set up for wide screen format.<br /><br />The movie itself is a classic of classics, the story of an English map maker in service to his country. Bored by what he is doing, he wants to see some action. Soon he does, but the action changes him. The movie is about how T. E. Lawrence grows from an idealistic young man to a battle hardened man who discovers that he likes killing, and yet is repulsed by it. The movie also proclaims that T. E. Lawrence was one of the principals involved in Arab independence and the movie is about some of the seminal moments in the uniting of many Arab tribes. The movie also provides as much information about Lawrence's psychology as it does about his actions, because his psychology, from being able to put out a match with his bare fingers to calling for the elimination of a fleeing column of Turkish troops with the taking of no prisoners, provides insights into the complex psyche of the person of T. E. Lawrence.<br /><br />The battles are exquisitely executed. The fights are extremely well choreographed, and I admire the stamina and dedication of the hundreds of people involved in the creation of this movie as they created this movie in desert temperatures. Given the care that is taken with safety in modern films, I believe this movie would be extremely difficult to film in the same way today.<br /><br />Ultimately, the art, the story, the locations, the music, the script, the costumes and the action all come together to create an incredibly compelling and realistic story of T. E. Lawrence. This movie is a must-have for a collector of great films.how T. E.

B000056H5J|5.0|Enya brings us once again the haunting music that is her trademark, written in multiple languages.<br /><br />The CD kicks off with the mellow instrumental \\"A Day without Rain.\\" A piano provides the principal musical instrument with Enya humming in harmony. The music evokes nature at peace; woods with a light breeze on a cool day, light clouds dotting a peaceful sky. You could readily sleep to this music. The instrumental leads into \\"Wild Child,\\" a faster paced song that stays within the musical theme of the peaceful outdoors, but now the music has the theme of the wild, yet innocent child, frolicking in the benign environment. Enya's vocals are as much instrument as the instruments themselves. This song is beautiful in its conception and execution.<br /><br />\\"Only Time\\" follows. Enya proves once again that she has the ability to create beautiful musical poetry. The deceptively light lyrics can pull the listener into a deep contemplation of love and life and the roads that we choose. The lyrics also explain that we must have patience because only time will allow all to be revealed in fullness.<br /><br />Enya then switches themes and styles as she moves into a Latin song with heavy bass backing. The literal translation of \\"Tempus Vernum\\" is \\"Spring Time.\\" The lyrics appear to be a series of words that might be considered to be opposites, such as east and west, earth and star, and autumn and spring. Thus in one sense Roma Ryan's lyrics appear to be exploring the Yin and Yang of some Asian philosophies, the contrast of opposites. The serious, ponderous tone of the music is heavily contemplative; deep philosophical evaluation of a subject; beautiful in the selection of words and the musical match.<br /><br />The musical tone then becomes a Gaelic lament, \\"Deora ar mo chroi,\\" or \\"Tears on My Heart.\\" The gentle, sad music belies the actual translation of the Gaelic, which is full of beauty and happiness. The effect is more in the poetry of the Gaelic and how well the music is matched to it rather than the actual meaning of the words. The execution is very artistic and poignant.<br /><br />Enya then lightens the music with \\"Flora's Secret,\\" which has a faster pace than the previous two selections. This love song is musical poetry and is beautiful and full; a musical wine. You may either interpret the song from an aspect of nature, or of two lovers. In either case, this song is an experience.<br /><br />\\"Fallen Embers\\" is a dream, a memory of a former love. Mellow, slow, but sufficiently ethereal to keep from being ponderous. Enya's beautiful voice is the centerpiece of the song. The instruments add fullness, but her voice alone could have carried this song.<br /><br />\\"Silver Embers\\" is another instrumental with a moderate pace. Short and, as always, beautiful, this song leads into \\"Pilgrim,\\" yet another lament. I personally enjoy this song because the theme is that there are many roads to choose in life, some of which lead to nowhere, and yet we have no clue as to which is which, and which is the best. We are all pilgrims in life, and this song is our song.<br /><br />Sometimes I have difficulty in interpreting Roma Ryan's lyrics. Such is the case with \\"One by One.\\" I understand that this song is about love, but some of the lyrics imply there is a constraint between him and her, and she is longing to be free of those constraints. Yet the final stanza implies that love binds them and will never die; a bit confusing for my poor brain.<br /><br />This version adds \\"The First of Autumn.\\"  Other versions add \\"Isobella.\\"  I would like to have had both on one CD, which would have made a longer version.  Both songs are nice to have, and I find it obnoxious to have to buy multiple CD's to obtain all the available tracks.<br /><br />The quicker-paced \\"Lazy Days\\" finishes off the CD. Given the general theme of nature and love this song appears to tidily wrap up the CD with the promise of things yet to come.<br /><br />Enya has once again created another sumptuously beautiful work of music that you can listen to time after time just to begin to appreciate the complexity and poetry of this music. This music is unique and nearly stands in its own category. It is artistically and technically flawless. The only possible flaw this CD has is that it is only about 39 minutes long. I could argue that for the beauty and quality of the music 39 minutes is a great length, but it seems to me that a bit more quantity would have made this CD absolutely phenomenal. As it is, it begs to be combined with another short work to create a full CD's worth of music; admittedly a minor flaw.<br /><br />Enjoy!> <br />Enya has once again created another sumptuously beautiful work of music that you can listen to time after time just to begin to appreciate the complexity and poetry of this music.

B000060P79|1.0|Remember the style of music that came out in the late 70's called Punk?    The pioneers of this type of music were bands such a Clash, The Sex Pistols, The Ramones and the Talking Heads.  The style becamse somewhat funk-influenced to the gut-wrentching hardcore metal influenced sounds of The Dead Kennedies and Ministry.  Even Social Distortion had their own little sound to offer.  This is how it went through the 80's.    Yet, after the who Nirvana-mania that saved music from Whitesnake and Warrent, Punk, as well as many other sounds, seemed lost until...    Green Day comes around with \\"Dookie.\\"  This continued the punk sound into what we know today.    So in the words of Oasis:  \\"Where did it all go wrong.\\"    It's not that this sounds on it's own is bad.  When Blink 182 first came out, they had a lot of fun to offer.  But gawd, where do we draw the line?  After that, we had ( in no particular order) Sum 41, New Found Glory, My Chemical Romance, Showoff, and jeez, I could go on forever.  They all sound so much alike.  Still they were once tolerable.  But with simple plan, (sigh), enough is enough.  I can't even tell the difference sometimes between these guys and Bowling For Soup.  And I don't easily confuse bands.    Really, though, these guy call themselves Punk.  But last time I checked, Punk was about rebellion, Anarchy, disatisfaction with where humanity is going, all that stuff.  Ex Sex Pistols \\"Anarchy In The UK\\" or Ramones \\"I'm Against It.\\"  Now Listen to some of the titles off this:  \\"I'm Just A Kid,\\" \\"God Must Hate Me,\\" \\"I'd Do Anything.\\"  Difference?  You'd have to be blind not to see one.  These guys have jumped on the \\"poser\\" bandwagon that every other \\"punk\\" band on a major label has jumped on, and thus, mainstream punk is doing the same thing heavy Metal is.
1840233028|5.0|In the 1960s I loved the \\"Classics Illustrated\\" series of comics. The stories were based, as the title implies, on classic novels. Perhaps my favorite was \\"Master of the World,\\" based on the novel of the same name by Jules Verne. The science fiction theme and the characters created a wonderful world that appeared as though it could be real, rather than the complete fantasy of Superman or Marvel's venerable lineup of mutants and superheroes.<br /><br />\\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" is reminiscent of those great Classics Illustrated comics, but with a much more adult edge. Early in the book we find Alan Quatermain addicted to opium and apparently well down the road to an oblivious death. We soon find Hawley Griffin, the \\"Invisible Man,\\" creating multiple pregnancies attributed to either demons or saints. Clearly this story is far different from the comics I read as a youth. But what a story this is. While told with a distinctly adult edge, the story is an epic tale of some of the best literary characters of the Victorian era fighting against a villain intent on (what else?) conquering the world.<br /><br />In the course of the travails of the dubiously phrased good guys a number of deaths occur, and the significantly less than pure predilections of our heroes form a dark base to a story that is nominally of good versus evil, but turns out to be more of evil versus not-as-evil.<br /><br />The real marvel of the story is the style in which it was written. I have read many of the classics that form a basis for this graphic novel, and the style herein emulates that style in a disconcertingly exceptional way. There were points where I wondered how Alan Moore was able to capture the style of 100 years ago in a newly created novel. If there were gross inconsistencies with that style, I was unable to find them. Those unfamiliar with classic literature may find the style a bit difficult to read, but once you get into it you find that it challenges your mental abilities and makes you think about events and writing in a different way.<br /><br />There have been few graphic novels for which I would provide more than a mild recommendation to another reader. In the case of this novel, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys graphic novels and classic literature, particularly adventure classics. If you enjoyed the \\"Classics Illustrated\\" series of books that date quite far into the past, you will find some similarities. However, be warned that this is clearly an adult story.<br /><br />Enjoy!bilities and makes you think about events and writing in a different way. <br /> <br />There have been few graphic novels for which I would provide more than a mild recommendation to another reader.

B00005JP5J|4.0|LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE (LMS) is a wonderful example of a movie that has many moments that make you want to laugh and cry at the same time...both for legitimate reasons.  Why do I think this is a notable accomplishment?  Because I think you have to really care about the characters to reach that point.  When outrageous things happen to characters you don't care much about...you'll just laugh.  And if the circumstances are too horrific, and you care about the characters, you'll cry.  This movie walks the line, and that isn't easy. <br /> <br />LMS is about a fairly typical \\"indie-movie-dysfunctional family.\\"  A loser father who tries to teach empowerment workshops (Greg Kinear), his wife (Toni Collette) who is the closest thing to a voice of reason, their young daughter (Abigail Breslin, who is a finalist in a young-girl's beauty pageant...but has no business being).  There's also Collette's longer teenage son (who has taken a vow of silence...THAT'S something we've never seen a teen do in the movies!!!) And Colette's suicidal gay brother who is Proust scholar (Steve Carell).  Rounding out the group is Kinear's cantankerous old father (Alan Arkin), who has been kicked out of his retirement community for doing drugs.  So, the movie loses some points for lack of an original group of characters. Indie movies are alway SO interested in quirky people...but after two decades of post-Sex, Lies & Videotape independence...we've seen all the \\"new\\" archetypes before. <br /> <br />The movie is about the family's eventful roadtrip from Albuquerque (my home town and current residence) to SoCal for the contest...and then the contest itself.  The trip is undertaken in an old VW bus, which early on, loses its clutch, and can thus only run in 3rd and 4th gear.  This leads to some very amusing and somehow touching moments with all these characters push-starting the car and then one by one, leaping into the open door!  This is creative (and very believable if you've ever owned a VW!).   <br/> <br />Most of the film chronicles the journey, which includes moments both ridiculous and sad (as I said above).  Plans go awry.  You can feel the sweat of impending despair.  Then, they arrive, and the contest itself is almost like another movie.  It becomes as much a comment on the beauty pageant industry as anything else.  This part, while amusing, deflates some of the power the film was building towards...and the \\"climactic\\" scene wants to be sublime, but is only mildly pleasing.  We've had our tone jarred too much. <br /> <br />I don't want you to think I didn't like the film.  Most of it is excellent, primarily because of the outstanding performances.  Alan Arkin is always great (in my opinion, he's the single greatest film actor never to win an Oscar...I will pretty much see anything he's in.)  Greg Kinear, doing another take on his \\"decent loser\\" is in fine form.  His character generates equal amounts of pity and frustration...and that's exactly what it should do!  Toni Collette is another performer who can seemingly do no wrong...including one of the most convincing American accents ever done by an Australian.  She is simply a terrific actress.  Steve Carell steals the show in many ways.  His character undergoes the most growth, and in some ways, the most pain.  Yet Carell hardly changes expressions.  (Although I must say that when Carell smiles, he has a wonderful, glowing, innocent smile that cannot help but make you feel better.)  His performance is very internal, deep, and best of all...really, really funny.  He's so different here than in THE OFFICE, or BRUCE ALMIGHTY.  If anyone thought his string of success is a fluke...think again...this guy is the real deal. <br /> <br />So I heartily recommend the film for its richness (even when it descends into cliche...it's heartfelt) and the great acting.  Frankly, that's enough right there.  It is R-rated for some obscene rants by the grandfather...but for all that, it feels strangely innocent. <br /> <br/>And for natives of Albuquerque...none of the film was shot in New Mexico, and it shows.  Even the interior shots don't \\"feel\\" like a house you would see in Albuquerque.  This doesn't detract from the film at all...I'm just mentioning it.
B000GJKM7Q|5.0|I can no longer remember the first time I saw this great story of hope and miracles. Once having seen it, you will always remember its story of encouragement and faith, and in a positive way showing that what goes around truly does come around.<br /><br />George Bailey seems to be a simple man. In fact, he is a simple man. Yet, with his solid values and feeling for what is right and wrong, George touches the lives of those around him. George saves his brother from drowning as a child. When his brother grows older he shoots down an enemy plane during World War II, saving a transport ship into which the plane was attempting to crash. George prevents a pharmacist from accidentally giving a young boy poison as the pharmacist grieved for his own son. George takes on the responsibility for running the Bailey Savings and Loan when his father passes away. The list of good deeds that George performs is long, and he has affected an entire town more than individual lives.<br /><br />It seems that while George is not wealthy in terms of money, he leads a full life. He has a wife and children, and he is clearly a powerful force for good. His brother is coming home, a celebrated war hero. Life could hardly be better. But then an event occurs that can shake anyone. Eight thousand dollars is lost on its way to being deposited at the bank. Suddenly, George Bailey is under suspicion for embezzlement. Suddenly, all the good deeds that George has performed count for nothing, because George may find himself in prison as repayment for being a good man.<br /><br />George lashes out at those around him. He has always been the person with the solutions, and suddenly he finds himself in a situation he can't control or solve. He runs from this unsolvable problem, crashing his car, stumbles to a bridge to commit suicide. Before George can jump in, someone else jumps in; an angel with a mission.<br /><br />George and the angel, Clarence, talk about George's plight, and during the discussion George wishes he had never existed. The angel grants George's wish. We then see the Bedford Falls that would have existed had George never lived. The name of the town is Pottersville and it is full of bars, vice and crime. Many of the houses owned by Mr. Potter are little more than hovels; slums in the making. The people that George touched live a very different life in this alternate reality.<br /><br />As dark as the movie is at times, at its heart it is a story of hope and miracles. George is given an opportunity to see the difference he has made in people's lives. George discovers that while evil has befallen him, the evil that he has personally averted is far worse. On the small chance you have not seen this movie, I'll not reveal the ending, but you may trust that the ending always brings a smile to my face.<br /><br />DVD has permitted a wonderful restoration of this movie to its former glory.  Note that there are several versions of this DVD available.  This particular version is region free.  Note also that each version carries various features and a different price.  You may wish to determine the version that best meets your needs before buying.<br /><br />Enjoy!sion George wishes he had never existed. The angel grants George's wish.

0694524441|5.0|This purchase was an impulse buy from a bookstore before I drove 5-1/2 hours to Houston. The CD came highly recommended by the clerk selling me some books. I thought, why not, I love Jeremy Irons' voice. This CD was indeed the best audio book I've ever heard and I've listened to almost 30. I had just recently finished \\"His Excellency\\" about George Washington, which is very long (13 cd's) and extremely good. Although I'd never heard of Paulo Coelho, who is internationally famous, I know and love Jeremy Irons as an actor, and he should win an award for performing the characters in this book. I finished it the following day driving to Austin and thoroughly enjoyed the deeper meaning behind the story. Since Santiago's adventures reminded me of my son and how he met his wife, I gave this audio book to him for his birthday. He is very well-read and this book, he tells me, is his new favorite.

0930289528|4.0|The reviews that warn about fascism partly miss the point of Alan Moore's writings. It is about both fascism and anarchy. The written version is not as artistically skilled as the movie - but the movie took liberties that re-shaped Moore's writings in a way that actually lost some of the seminal points in Moore's book.<br /><br />There is no doubt that there is a danger both ways. Even in our culture. In many respects, as Alan Moore recognizes, both in his fiction and his public statements, we see the threat of both in our culture.<br /><br />Fascism is one and the same with Communism (though many don't understand this). It, like Communism, is about control. Equating McCarthyism and Nixon's actions with fascism is a mistake stemming from a superficial understanding. Moore, however, \\"gets\\" fascism. It is, regardless of its form or orgin (religious or godless) about control of a human race.<br /><br />Anarchism, on the other hand, is society without any control. It is about freedom without the rule of law - and that too has dire consequences as Moore recognizes in Vendetta. The irony is, both neo-conservatives and modern liberals want both a bit of anarchy - whether freedom from business regulation (the neo-con) or from artistic expression (the lib) - and a bit of control - e.g., a stronger police power in the fight against terrorism or other violent crime (the neo-con) or stronger regulations against endangering the environment (the lib). They just want it in different areas. Both liberals and neo-cons are part fascist, part anarchist. Ultimately, there is danger in both because they want power.<br /><br />In the end, anarchy and fascism come full circle. The weak in both systems live in terror from the strong. Such, it appears to me, is one of the comparisons Alan Moore hopes for his readers to grapple with.

0895260131|5.0|This book lays out the 'not-so-hidden-agenda' of today's Islamic world. Using quotes from the Qur'an and 'Hadith Qudsi', Spencer leads us through the birth of Islam by Muhammad, into the Jihadists of today! By discussing the true reason for the Crusades, he 'lays to bed' the myth that Islam was a victim and not a perpetrator. Reviewing the 'peace of Saladin' (\\"say anything you need to in order to gain strength and win\\") brings one to the conclusion that the peace under Islam is only true for those within the religion - infidels beware!

B000002HH9|5.0|Wild Mood Swings is not a bad cd.  Many of the negative reviews come right out and admit to trying to pull the rating of this cd down.  Why?  It usually comes down to being stuck in the past.  There are a lot of people who cannot accept Robert Smith doing anything outside of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me or Disintegration.<br /><br />Wild Mood Swings is different.  It's upbeat in some places and downbeat in others (ok, ok, I know that describes Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me but the instrumentation is different here); it's not your typical Cure release but I like it.  It reminds me some of The Top, a much more psycho and, in many cases, just as maligned an effort.<br /><br />WMS also reminds me of many of the silly music that made up the mid-80's.  There are lots and lots of great keyboard sounds to go around and a ton of great guitar.  What's not to like?
B000GFLAI0|3.0|I waited like a kid at Christmas for this disc to be released. I was so convinced by the hype and the fact that Mr. Dylan had a few years to put into this that it would be the crowning achievement of his return to roots/americana music. Man, am I disappointed. The music is well played and well recorded but never comes off as anything other than tepid. Worst of all the great poet fails to rise to the level of the musicianship. This must be the least lyrically interesting album of his career. That being said, it's nice to have new Dylan. But in all honesty there's no revelation to be found. I'm already waiting to see what comes next.
0738702994|5.0|This is the only newly published tarot set I planned to purchase this year, and I was not disappointed. This is a loving tribute to the founder of Llewellyn publications. It could have easily been called the \\"Welsh Tarot\\". It is named after the now famous astrologer who established the prolific magical publisher.  <br /> <br />Tarot is not new. This deck bears this in mind as the Minor arcana are careful reinterpretations of the Rider-Waite images. These symbols are now recognizable all over the world. Beginners can easily study and memorize the images.  <br /> <br />Now, looking at the major Arcana, we get to the heart of the deck, as well as Celtic(Welsh) mythology. Other than the Mabinogion, very little is written concerning the subject. Miss Ferguson's accompaning book clearly tells of the Welsh Myth, with the \\"Gods\\" and larger than life personalities contained herein. One must see these images to truely appreciate them. The Star 17 is the most beautful I have ever seen! <br /> <br />The colors are warm, unlike the artist previous Arthurian Tarot. She has outdone that deck by leaps and bounds, creating images that are welcoming and endearing. One may wonder if she actually visited this Otherworld she talks about and illustrated it. In the great forest of Tarot decks. This one stands out like the tallest Sycamore. <br /> <br />Included in the set is the book and matching beaded Tarot protective bag. The cards themselves are a bit wider than average and a little too thin. I dont plan on reading with them often. As far as themed decks are concerned, this one is one of the best! Bravo Miss Ferguson!
B000FQJAIW|3.0|For those of you complaning about George Lucas and this 3rd release of Star Wars on DVD, you need to get your facts straight.  <br /> <br />1. It was NOT Lucas's idea to release the original theatrical cut of the movie. Lucas has stated several times that he would never release the versions of the film on DVD because he considered them unfinished works. This release was spearheaded by his company, Lucasfilm. <br /> <br />2. Because Lucas didn't want this release, he refused to have money spent remastering the original films for anamorphic widescreen. He even went so far as to claim than no original prints of the film existed, but this is not true. That's why Lucasfilm was forced to use the version they have. It's also why we probably never will see a remastered copy of this release. <br /> <br />3. Lucas insisted that the DVD's include the 2004 versions of the film. This is so that any sales of these DVD's will boost the total money earned by these versions even further. This way Lucas can conviently ignore the fact that most people are buying this for the original versions. <br /> <br />So if your're gonna condem George Lucas for something, condem him for the right thing. It's not his fault some of you have to buy another DVD set, but it is his fault your not getting the best quality version of the film. Now, if you haven't bothered picking up the DVD sets before now, then this is a good release to get. Still, there probably will be a box set of all 6 movies at some point in the future, but wether or not it will contain the original theatrical versions is uncertain at this time.

I have read some good stuff.  I've also read some real stinkers.  This one doesn't really fall into either extreme.  There are some good ideas in this book, and then there are principles or broad statements that are simply incorrect or poorly researched.  On the good side, the author lays out one of the best and most understandable definitions of asset/liability that I've ever seen.  The explanation of the difference in such clear terms may, in itself, make the purchase of this book worthwhile. <br /> <br />On the downside, the author seems to espouse a \\"get-rich-quick\\" kind of attitude, or at the very least utilizes a communication style that holds those types of ideas implicit.  His advocation of the heavy use of debt to turn your cash flow will indeed work for some.  For the vast majority, however, it will lead to steps back rather than forward on the balance sheet. <br /> <br />There is value in the book.  However when you come to the realization that the vast majority of the author's current financial position has been built upon the foundation of the Rich Dad franchise and it's subsequent success, you must ask yourself if there is more money to be made in following the principles outlined in the book, or in writing about them. <br /> <br />Just one man's thoughts.

091581112X|5.0|I think that in the world there is still some confusion between religion and spirituality. You can be religious, but not spiritual. You can know all the creeds, follow all the dogmas, practice all the rites and passages but if there is no Spirit involved in with what you are doing and practicing, what good is it? I think the main reason why more and more people don't break out of their old religious mindsets is because they have become superstitious about their beliefs. They fear that God might punish them or forsake them or send them to hell for attempting to expand their beliefs.<br /><br />This book really gave me some valuable insights on how you can truly spiritualize the ordinary...because NOTHING is ordinary! Everything is already Spirit. We don't make something spiritual...we look to see where the Spirit might be in this situation. And maybe you're grumbling to yourself, \\"There ain't nothin' spiritual about my situation...\\"<br /><br />Let me give you a few reminders, if you're experiencing bad health than this is your opportunity to express good health. Start throwing away the ding dongs and cheetos and start buying apples and bananas. Pour the beer down the drain and start drinking water and green tea. Get off the couch and take a walk. But above all else, realize that Spirit is your health. Every cell, every atom, every strand of your being is made in the Image and Likeness of Perfect Health. Your body wants to renew Itself right now. It's not your body that is to blame, it's what you're telling yourself, it's what you are believing. Say to yourself now, \\"I am healthy. My body is vibrant and alive. I feel good. I now decide to express health and vibrancy each and every day.\\" Say this to yourself morning, noon, and night. Talk about wealth. talk about vibrancy. Keep your conversation in \\"Heaven\\".<br /><br />Maybe you feel poor and like an abject failure. Hey, I've been there...I really have. But now is the accepted time to realize that today is another day and you do not have to believe what you used to believe about yourself. Say to yourself...better yet go look in a mirror and say to yourself, \\"I am an abundant child of the universe. I am open now to new possibilities, to Divine opportunities, to experiences and situations that empower me, bless me, and prosper me.\\" God did not create anyone poor or miserable. We are here to live the abundant life. we are here to be successful and fulfilled.<br /><br />Okay, your last relationship soured. Just like the one before that and the one before that. It means nothing. It only means that you need to create a better relationship with yourself first. You need to be the person you wish to attract. Be kind, be forgiving, be loving, be peaceful.

We all have the power of intuition but most of us, if not all of us, refuse to believe it. Start making the realization that you deserve only the very best and you do! This is precisely why you are going to be the very best for nobody else but you!<br /><br />Spiritual Growth is about making daily changes and minor shifts in your perception. Spiritual Growth is exponential. You will be amazed at how much progress you can make in as little as 21 days if you just keep at it. Be forgiving, be merciful, be gentle with yourself. Feed yourself with books that empower you.

B000AADYRQ|4.0|This is a melancholy but beautiful CD.  If you can make it through track 9, What Sarah Said, without tearing up, you are stronger than I am. I think the best song on Plans is Brothers in a Hotel Bed but with so many to chose from, its hard to pick just one.<br /><br />All the other songs on Plans are just as strong, if not stronger, than the ones that have been played on the radio.  So, if you like what you've heard on the radio, you will just love the rest of this CD.

1592401791|1.0|Paul led the Beatles during A Hard Days Night?  I guess that's why almost every song is by John, and how he would dominate the Beatles hit factory for years, even when checking out.  John wrote \\"Eight Days A Week\\" on Beatles For Sale -- Paul's contribution: the lame dated \\"I'll Follow The Sun.\\"  That's not what I would call artistic leadership, in any case.<br /><br />Frame The Beatles as architects, and Geoff Emerick was their talented sub-contractor, working for general contractor George Martin.<br /><br />But that's not the way Geoff sees it.<br /><br />Emerick's recollection of his days with the Beatles is so slanted and hollow, you start to wonder what's true and what isn't.  He captures the timing of the process, and the events of the day, but its all twisted to fit his importance and McCartney's.<br /><br />I hate to be a person who judges things by appearance, but where are all the pictures of Geoff with the Beatles in this book?  Where are all of the shots backing up all the \\"we did this\\" and \\"we did thats?\\"<br /><br />Permission denied?<br /><br />In the few shots included on the back cover, we see Geoff looking very much like the nerdy odd-man out, uncompfortable in his own skin; which is the impression you get after reading the words.<br /><br />I can't wait to hear how Gilmore really wrote \\"Dark Side Of The Moon.\\"
B000FIMG68|5.0|This show is a MUST SEE!  You have to start with season one and pay attention to details.  The show is very intricate and detailed with many hidden clues.  It even helps to keep notes on things that seem out of place or strange so you can remember them later and peice things together.  Great writers and characters that you will fall in love with!  Season 2 has a different feel than season 1 but still keeps you on your toes and leaves you wanting more and more!  I hope season 3 gives more insight to the questions that are lingering.  Just be sure to pace yourself when watching these because once you start you won't want to stop!!
B000002G7G|5.0|This also makes a better intro to the group than any compilation, since it balances the sleazy decadence and bizarre experimentation of the first two albums with the pop savvy of Loaded, throwing in a few sensitive ballads that turn out to be among the group's best work. For starters, the fragile, heartbreaking Pale Blue Eyes steals the show in its own understated way. Candy Says comes close, though, an excellent introspective number from the prespective of a drag queen who wants escape from the underground (no pun intended) scene. Newcomer Doug Yule (thanks to Trimac20 for pointing out my dumb mistake!) provided his best vocals for the group, too.<br />But there's still plenty of rock 'n' roll: What Goes On is pure, mindless fun, in a good way. A very, very good way. Beginning to See the Light is a fine bit of acoustic rock 'n' roll, an unfortunately overlooked sub-genre. If you like the group's decadent lyrics,  yet highly entertaining, Some Kinda Love or After Hours, sung in an innocent tone from Maureen Tucker. And if it's head-scratching weirdness, Murder Mystery should do just fine.<br />A few tunes seem underwritten, but The Velvet Underground is a hard-earned five-star record.
B00005QDW1|4.0|Rock Steady is a great party album. No Doubt just let their hair down and did the damn thing. No, the music isn't ska, but it still has elements of island, reggae flavor mixed with rock. Their previous album Return of Saturn didn't really grab most people's attention despite being the best album of their career. I still marvel at how much I enjoy Return of Saturn, but I digress. Rock Steady comes one year later, and was met to better fanfare partly because the public was warmed over due to Gwen's solo appearances with Eve and Moby. Also, the music is simpler and catchier, which seems to be what the masses want.  <br /> <br />Most of the songs are really good. There are no Don't Speaks, but the album is very consistent. <br /> <br />Hella Good-this song was written by the Neptunes and I suspect they produced it even though the song is credited to being produced by Nellee Hooper. You can hear the Neptunes sound in it regardless. <br /> <br />Hey Baby-it took me forever to like this song. It was released as their first single, and I remember hearing it and going, \\"nope, I'm not buying the album.\\" Obviously, I changed my mind. <br /> <br />Making Out-has a weird sound but is pretty good. Think of a discoish, electronic, computer game like 80s sound. <br /> <br />Underneath It All-a good song with Lady Saw as a featurette. One of the reggae songs. <br /> <br />Detective-a cute song about a girl catching her guy cheating. \\"Hey girl save the liar. Can't you see his pants on fire?\\" <br /> <br />Don't Let Me Down-the worst song on the album.  <br /> <br />Start The Fire-another reggae song. It's competent, but I hardly listen to it.  <br /> <br />Running-a sentimental song about trying to keep a relationship on track. <br /> <br />In My Head-one of my favorites. It's about a paranoid woman who can't trust her boyfriend. I love it when she chants \\"...cause everybody wants everybody else! Everybody wants everybody else! Only in my head.\\" <br /> <br />Platinum Blonde Life-I didn't like it initially but it has grown on me. I love the music and the lyrics. <br /> <br />Waiting Room-most seem to really hate this song, but I love it. It's weird sounding, but Prince produced it and is featured in it. I love Prince and No Doubt. If they make a cool song together, it's musical bliss. <br /> <br />Rock Steady-a great song that probably should have been released as a single instead of Running. <br />
B000002MP2|1.0|Green Day claims themselves to be a \\"punk\\" group - I say this isn't true. Why? Sure, none of them had much talent (I do like their bass player, though), but their music has too much of a glossy pop sheen to be considered \\"real\\" punk. It also doesn't have the ramshackle, ready-to-explode feel of a Clash song, for instance: a song like the latter group's White Riot sounds like it's about to come apart at any minute, whereas Longview feels much more together and streamlined. So, what's wrong with this? Nothing. It's okay if a group has a pop-rock feel - just thought I'd clear that up as to why Green Day cannot be considered punk.<br />Now, onto why I don't like this. Most of the blame can be placed on Billie Joe Armstrong - the bassist (whoever he is) is actually OK. For instance, the only part of Longview I like is the bassline, which is pretty cool: the drummer is completely faceless. But Mr. Armstrong is among the most annoying rock stars on the planet: his nasal voice REALLY grinds the nerves, his guitar skills are lacking (part of their \\"punk\\" credentials, I suppose), and his lyrics are mainly complaining about suburban boredom - honestly, would you rather live in the inner city, where overpasses or parking garages substitute as homes and people are killed regularly? Be thankful for what you've got, moron. Then there were those million big annoying hits (Longview; When I Come Around; Welcome to Paradise; She; Basket Case) that have been forced down our throats for God knows how long. Green Day was just another faceless, no-talent power trio from Seattle forced upon us by MTV thanks to the breaktrhough of a much more talented power trio (Nirvana). As of Dookie, Green Day was essentially Nirvana dressed up with a pop sheen. Billie Joe DOES have a good sense of humor, though - had the guy been a comedian, rather than a guitarist, I would've probably been a fan of his.
B000002AGM|5.0|At last this album reaveals itself in sound worthy of its creators. I dearly love this album, but I must take exception to a comment in an earlier review:    \\"Anyone who is a fan of jazz already knows that the form, when executed properly, is readily capable of tapping into pith and pathos of the truly human experience. It addresses issues that \\"proper\\" classical music ignores. This is not to say that I don't like classical music but, considering the general history of humanity, the emotional content of music prior to the mid-nineteenth century is a bit antiquated and doesn't express the true spectrum of experience of a post-atomic society.\\"    I am in complete agreement with the first sentence. One could say this album, among a number of others, is 'living  proof' of an inherent truth. However, I disagree with what follows, and I note that the mid-nineteenth century is chosen as a cutoff. Late romanticism, Mahler, Debussy, Stravinsky, Berg, Bartok,Britten, Copland, Martinu, Messiaen, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Vaughan-Williams and others all speak to the modern condition in works ranging from chamber music to that on the largest scale. I assume the writer agrees.     But I also find, along with T.S Eliot, Aldous Huxley and others, music that is eternally contemporary in the late string quartets of Beethoven, in the last piano sonatas of Schubert, in Bach -- and if we cannot find resonance in Mozart -- think of the prison yard scene in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION -- then we are sadly diminished, indeed.     Every society since Aeschylus has been 'post-atomic' from it's own point of view, and the range of emotions humans experience has not changed from that time. In \\"Miles Ahead\\" the mode of expression is close to us -- it is our vocabulary -- but even now that is lost on a generation that knows only rap and hip-hop, and to whom Miles is as distant as Mozart.
0465092756|5.0|String theory is a formidable subject to learn, both from a physical and mathematical standpoint. But it is even a harder subject to teach to an audience of non-experts, not because its ideas are hard to express verbally in front of this audience, but because its practitioners sometimes feel it is beneath them to do so. Those who are not familiar with string theory but are curious as to its conceptual foundations might therefore be left to themselves to pursue an understanding of these foundations. However such an understanding can be obtained, for there are of late a few books that have been written by experts in string theory that are targeted to a readership that have a strong desire to learn the subject.<br /><br />The author of this book recognizes the paucity of expository material on string theory, particularly that dealing with the mathematical formalism, and although this book is a polemic against string theory and its status as a physical and scientific theory, the author introduces (perhaps on purpose) the reader to the theory in a way that is understandable without sacrificing scientific accuracy. But the book could also be of interest to more advanced readers, i.e. those (such as this reviewer) who have a thorough understanding of the physics and mathematics behind string theory but who are not conducting research in it. The author demands rightfully that scientific theory must be testable or at least must have some amount of empirical predictions. He pulls no punches in his critique of string theory, and is very open about what he thinks are the motivations behind those who are actively involved in it. A researcher's motivations of course are not germane to the validity of a theory that he or she proposes, but they are relevant to the understanding of why a particular theory is entrenched in the scientific community, even though there is no experimental evidence for it.<br /><br />This reviewer disagrees with the author in his claim that string theory is not a \\"beautiful\\" theory. And it is the mathematical formalism that is used in string theory that gives it its beauty. Indeed, just the algebraic geometry alone that is employed in string theory is an example of this. That combined with the differential geometry, complex manifolds, and algebraic topology makes string theory a beautiful multi-faceted mathematical gem. That being said, there are many ideas in string theory that deserve to be classified as \\"speculative\\" mathematics, as the author does in this book. This classification arises because of the presence of the ubiquitous path integral, an object that has resisted rigorous mathematical formulation.<br /><br />So yes, the mathematical formalism behind string theory is beautiful, and intoxicates those who contemplate it. But a physical theory must be more than just \\"mental masturbation\\" (a characterization imputed to the physicist Murray Gell-Mann in the book). It must also make predictions that can be measured in the laboratory, and these measurements must be reproducible and above all understandable to interested parties.  The author does not find any of these predictions in the string theory as it exists at the present time, and he is correct in his claims.<br /><br />Those who have worked in the academic setting will understand fully the negative reaction the author received when the manuscript was being circulated for review, and which he describes in some detail in the book. This criticism of course was anonymous, following the usual practice in the research community, and such anonymity is a temptation for recklessness and vituperation, and the author gives examples of this. So the book does not only describe some of the ideas of string theory, it also goes into the social interactions and attitudes among string theorists. It would be unfair to say that all string theorists are arrogant and protective of their status as academicians. But those that meet this characterization are in a position that cannot be morally justified. The discovery of scientific truth demands a transparency not only because of the complications of the theory, but also because those who are not directly participating in it are responsible for it's financing (the taxpayer). String theorists, along with all scientific and mathematical researchers are morally obligated to report their discoveries to those who are not in their field in a manner that makes it crystal clear what they are all about. String theory should not be a collection of documents that are to be protected and interpreted by a small body of privileged priests of knowledge.he discovery of scientific truth demands a transparency not only because of the complications of the theory, but also because those who are not directly participating in it are responsible for it's financing (the taxpayer).

032147404X|5.0|<br />This is the most practical and useful book on digital photography that you will find on the shelves. The book is Filled with tips and tricks of the trade that the professional photographers use every day to get wonderful looking pictures using nothing but a digital camera similar to the one you have. Why their photographs look better than yours? Well is not always the camera, most of the credit is to know how to take advantage of the camera you have: selecting the right settings for different situations, choosing the right location, etc.  <br /> <br />Full of examples and straight to the point tips, this book will definitively improve the quality of every single shot you take. When I compare the pictures I took before I read the book with my latest pictures, it looks like I am know using a far better or more expensive digital camera, but the only difference is the know-how I gained from the book.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|I started hearing Supermassive Black Hole on XM Radio's Ethel (ch 47) about 3 or 4 weeks ago, and I was intrigued.  It was like nothing I'd heard in a long time.  How often these days do you get falsetto with a thumping dance beat and some power guitar thrown in? <br />I purchased the album and took my first listen the day before yesterday, and I am still thinking it over.  I tried pigeonholing Muse into a genre but I think this album defies my attempts to quantify it and ends up being something pretty unique.  Admittedly they have a sound influenced by many bands - I think I hear a little Queen, a little ELO, a little U2 or perhaps a little Coldplay, but they never settle into one specific genre or sound, and I like that.   <br /> <br />Clearly I'm drawn to Supermassive Black Hole, but both Invincible and the hard rocking Assassin were quite good as well. <br /> <br />Give it a try - I think you might find something you like! I know I did.

B000GFLAI0|2.0|Meet me at the bottom... sings Bob Dylan in Workingman's Blues #2.  Certainly this is not the bottom, not the worst of Dylan's albums. That would arguably be Down in the Groove. (Another deliberately ironic title?)  <br /> <br />Still, listening to Modern Times brings to mind the story about the dancing bear. The amazing thing about a dancing bear is not that it dances well, but that it can dance on its hind feet at all. Bob Dylan is the old bear who is, contrary to reasonable expectation, still dancing. He's still selling records and still a hugely profitable force on tour after all these decades. So, one is tempted to review Modern Times as an amazing feat. Comparing it to his early work, or to the work of artists who are still vital creative forces, it is pretty ordinary.  <br /> <br />Modern Times is certainly ordinary in the musical sense. The band sounds like a crack country-rock outfit. As with many other Dylan albums, the arrangements seem slapdash, as if Bob handed them a lyric sheet with chords printed on it about five minutes before recording. Then Dylan sets the tempo, the band fires up, and they fake their way through the set. I know nothing of producer Jack Frost (wink, wink), but he seems to have exerted almost no attempt to infuse the music with the structure and drama that one finds on Dylan's Infidels (produced by Mark Knopfler) or Oh Mercy (produced by Daniel Lanois).  What we get are typical country blues, typical country-rock shuffle, typical old-time country waltzes and ballads, typical melodies, typical guitar solos. Beyond The Horizon wouldn't seem out of place on a Leon Redbone album.  <br /> <br />The blandness of the accompaniment would be nothing to quibble over if the lyrical content was as brilliant as we know Bob Dylan can sometimes be. But we see the barest flashes of clever wordplay here. Mostly we must be content with silly stuff like, \\"I got troubles so hard, I just can't stand the strain. Some mean old lazy slut has charmed away my brains.\\" Then again, Fire on the Mountain isn't bad. But isn't it almost insulting for Dylan, one of the richest \\"song and dance men\\" in show business, singing the workingman's blues? Yeah, Bob. A hard rain's gonna fall, but the people out here in the cheap seats won't be meeting YOU at the bottom.  <br /> <br />Dylan strikes out at greed, violence, disaster. Evoking the apocalypse, the judgment, the end of the road, but also the tenderness and balm of love. Dylan has done it all before, and much more coherently and poetically.  <br /> <br />OK, Dylan does what Dylan does, whether he's making a serious effort or just pulling our leg. He puts it out, and some people will praise it just because it is Bob Dylan, and just because he is a dancing bear, which is amazing in some strange circus-show way. You won't really miss much if you avoid Dylan's post-80s output, the effusive critical praise of Time Out Of Mind notwithstanding. Even that supposed nugget was just painful to listen to, especially compared to the easygoing Love And Theft. Modern Times is easy to take, but there's not enough *there* there. Stick to the old Dylan classics. I'm buying the remastered releases of his best work, and it is a much better investment.
1400049628|5.0|Imagine if you will, living in the shadow of a danger that you've never recognized; living every day at risk of a situation that's been hidden from you your entire life.  Imagine having your life dangle on a very thin string and having people keep knowledge from you that very well may save your life and the lives of your closes friends and family. Then imagine one day, having everything that's been kept from you being exposed.  This simple book opened my eyes to a world of danger and a need for constant alertness to and preparation for a situation that could rock the world of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people.  What will you do in the event of a Zombie outbreak? <br /> The book is The Zombie Survival Guide, brought to us by the forward thinking and prepared Max Brooks.  The book covers an incredible amount of information in extreme detail.  Information regarding the properties of the Solanum virus, and lab tested and proven zombie behavior.  It covers strategies for staying alive on the run, on the attack, on the retreat.  It covers the pros and cons of nearly every weapon one could come across or think of to fight the scourges of the walking dead.  Clothing suggestions, safe locations, survival techniques, tips on keeping sound mental health in an outbreak, suggested supplies and strategies for getting prepared early, signs to watch for in the media to identify a threat before others; everything is included.  <br /> Max Brooks has truly done the world a service, and I believe, preemptively saved the lives of hundreds, if not thousands of people.  For every person who takes the time to read his book and get accordingly prepared, dozens of lives will be saved by these informed individuals.  I myself have opened the eyes of dozens of my friends to the threat they've lived their entire lives in the shadow of, and gotten them to make preliminary preparations for.  Not everyone has the resources or financial stability to prepare as best they should, but atthe very least, the information and knowledge is completely and totally invaluable in the event of an outbreak of any size.  <br /> When the sun rises the next day, I will be alive; as will my friends and family.  Will you? <br />
B000GPIPVU|5.0|I love \\"Trouble\\" and really got hooked on Ray's music after seeing him perform live at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester (UK) last year. I will never ever forget that concert ... probably the most honest and emotional performance I have ever witnessed. <br /> <br />First spin of TTSTB and I noticed it didn't have that 'catchy' song like some on Trouble, so I knew it would take a little more before I would get into it. <br />Was I wrong!!!! It took me just a full listen to leave me breathless. Can't believe there is so much beauty flowing from the pen of one artist. <br />I really don't see all the comparisons some make here, certainly not with Van Morrison and the likes. But what I agree on is about all the rest. TTSTB is unique, is raw, honest, deep, dark, sober, beautifull, simpel but oh so effective ... and then that voice .... WOW!! <br /> <br />Two songs I remembered hearing at the concert, ie Lesson Learned and Can I Stay (need I say how quiet everyone was during that song??). There's just one song that is not really doing it for me, allthough I think it is right up there with the others (Gone Away ...). <br />The ones that will never leave me untouched are Be Here Now (listen how that simple guitar tune grows once the violins etc set in!!), Empty, Can I Stay, Flowers, TTSTB and ... maybe most of all ... WITHIN YOU (How many singers can keep you pinned down with such a simple tune and just one textline \\"War is not the answer. The answer is within you\\"). <br /> <br />I can assure you, my musical horizon is pretty wide, but when it comes to (tormented) singer/songwriters ... having Ray makes me save a lot of money ... just no need to go out and buy others (and I probably have heard about 70% of 'em ... but it's just not the same). <br /> <br />Ray Lamontagne is up there with the likes of Guthrie and Dylan. Be assured he is in no ways a lesser songwriter ... and he sure as hell is a way better singer.

And i have to say that I went into seeing this show with lower expectations than 25 years ago, and for the most part, my expectations were greatly exceeded.  Musically, the band were in great form (especially after all these years).  Visually, it was the usual mixed bag of moments - some absolutely stunning (especially the climax of 'And You and I'), others fairly random and not all that coordinated with the music.  But overall, it was a great experience.  This DVD captures the show remarkably well - sound, video, everything is top notch.    But I rate this DVD (and the live show i saw) at 4 stars for one main reason.  As a drummer, one of my earliest drum heroes was Alan White.  In the 70's, his playing was full of fire and energy.  His playing of older, Bruford-era material breathed much needed life into it, superceding Bruford's creative but somewhat mechanical playing.  With White, Yes rocked harder than most other progressive bands, and yet also maintained the subtlety which is so central and appealing in the genre.    However, over the past 25 years or so, I've witnessed White's playing slowly lose it's fire and passion.  And this concert was, in my opinion, the low point of his playing as i've witnessed it.  Granted, at their advanced ages, any of the members of Yes would look pretty ridiculous jumping around the stage and thrashing away at their instruments.  But while the other members of the group are still able to inject their playing with passion and energy, White looked like he was saving his energy for later in the show (or even just to make it through the show).  He played as if he were backing a lounge singer or something, not driving one of the most powerful prog rock bands to ever exist.  And so, even at those moments where the rest of the band were reaching the highest of highs, the backbone of the band was not able to fully support and drive it home.  It was disappointing to say the least.    (Ironically, while White's playing has declined, Bruford's playing gets better and better with each passing year, more creative and powerful and passionate than ever.  If this lineup were to tour with him on drums instead, it might just blow the roof off of the arena).    So...definitely well worth the purchase, especially for those who haven't had the chance to see the classic Yes lineup live.  But if you have memories of seeing or hearing the band in the 70's, you may want to dig out your lighters to add a little more fire to the experience... :-)    **Update 17 May 2007 - I notice that some of my remarks regarding Alan White's performance on this DVD have offended other fans.  No offense intended - White is still a fine musician.  I mentioned my impressions of his performance in light of the fact that, at least to me ears, the other four musicians in the band have seemingly lost none of their technical abililties with age and are still able to play with an energy and passion of musicians half their age, seasoned with maturity.  And I made my comments in light of what i consider to be the remarkable achievement of a drummer like Bill Bruford to actually improve his ability with age (and I say this as a percussion educator myself).  No, I did not expect Yes to resemble their form of the late 70's - on the whole, they exceeded my expectations.  I merely was attempting to articulate what i observed to be a marked difference in White's abilities as compared to the rest of the group and to his prior performances.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|Was blown away by the ending and how it all fit together. <br /> <br />You WILL understand what happened in one viewing.  Then you will probably watch it a second time to watch for all the clues. <br /> <br />It's been mentioned often, but without a doubt, the first movie I thought of when this was over was: Jacob's Ladder. <br /> <br />FYI this is not a horror flick, but rather a supernatural/psychological thriller along the lines of something like Jacob's ladder. <br /> <br />Truly a sleeper movie; I had not heard anything about this at all.  Now I talk it up to everybody.
B000FQJAIW|2.0|Making a movie anamorphic is not changing the film from it's original version. It's the most basic of basic standards for anything released on DVD today. Anamorphic widescreen transfers boost the picture resolution to make the movies look closer to it's original theatrical presentation. Making the movies non-anamorphic will plague the transfer with pixelation and artifacts that were not present when it was originally shown in theaters, especially when someone watching them on a widescreen tv has to \\"16:9 Zoom\\" the image.     If you go onto the [...], they have learned that a new DVD collection of all 6 films is in the works due out next year for the 30th anniversary, complete with even more changes to the films than the 2004 versions,and who knows what else they'll release in the future on high-def DVDs,including proper releases of the original versions.     The bottom line is: forget these DVDs and save your money, as you can bet you'll be cursing yourself over wasting your money when the future DVDs are released. If you must have the originals, there are pleny of bootlegs you can get that likely don't look or sound any worse than these, plus you don't have to buy the same 2004 DVDs you already bought.
B000FGGE68|2.0|Oh were to begin with this film?<br /><br />Do we start with the hideous CGI that screams \\"low budget\\" it looks like all the dough in this film was spent on Milla and her costumes.  The buildings and other CGI effects would be ok back when Tron was made but now look like refugees from a Final Cut Pro® workshop. Can you say fake? And since this chop-socky film needs good CGI to even make it somewhat believable the grade z computer work cripples this film right out of the box.<br /><br />And make no mistake this is a pure chop-socky film, but unfortunately we only have Ms Milla to chop and kick, nary a Jet Lei or Jacky Chan or Gordon Lee to be found.  As a matter of fact every other actor here looks like D-list material here at best.<br /><br />And Talking D-list lets talk about the choreography here. Chop socky films do have a certain flow to the fights at least the good ones do. Unfortunately the fight scenes here are all paint-by-numbers affairs. Not only that, they feel like the same fight scene.  And derivative  fight pieces are slow death for an action film like this one.<br /><br />What is to like here? Well in better hands the Si Fi premise definitely has legs.  What would a society look like if we became obsessed with disease, an AIDS like disease that was not so limited and much more virulent?  Where would we draw the line on \\"experimentation\\"?  What rights would we give up on to be \\"safe?\\"  Unfortunately this film blows past this to get to the (often ridiculous) fight scenes.<br /><br />And fans of High fashion won't be disappointed either as Milla is put in some absolutely smashing outfits.  But Milla would look smashing in a burlap sack. Also the few times the film actually slows down are also good.  Milla always put some passion to her roles and sometimes sweetness.  And in the few quiet moments she does shine through.  But then the film races on to fill the needs of the ADD hormone infused male teens that are it's core audience.<br /><br />Under no circumstances should you buy this DVD for full price, buy it used, or from the remainders bin./>Under no circumstances should you buy this DVD for full price, buy it used, or from the remainders bin.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I've been an IM fan since 1986 and may I say it's the band's best album since my favorite 7th son of a 7th son. All the songs are great, especially if you like some prog-rock stuff and old-school hard rock being woven into the more modern types of music. On the other hand, Maiden are already a classic rock-band themselves BUT they still rule! A must buy for any metal/hard rock fan. <br />PS Do not freak out if you don't like it right away, it's a big grower. Give it 3 or four listens and you'll understand what I'm talking about. <br />
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Let us sing the praises of Hugo Weaving. Mr. Smith is one awesome actor.  Interesting that he hooks up with the Wachowski brothers again. After the over hyped over baked and finally collapsed souffle that was Matrix 3 I wouldn't want to associate myself with them anytime soon.<br /><br />Here Mr Weaving spends the entire picture a Guy Faulks mask.  Any lesser actor would have been rendered into a basket case. Without his face to fill in the nuance of his character Weaving must use his voice and body to fill in the blanks.  Well to quote the W \\"mission accomplished\\"<br /><br />Weaving gives voice, passion, soul and believability to V.<br /><br />Weaving is supported by Natalie Portman, forget the poorly drawn caricature that was princess forgettable in Star Wars 1,2 and 3. Given a good premise and real character development  she soars in V. This is because she has real actors to play against and well written script.  Yup sci fi really works when it's not written by a hack who is way too fond of his CGI toys.<br /><br />Let me not forget Steven Rea's contribution either, his world weary Inspector is spot on.  His hound dog face extends to his character hound dog persistence.  While he is there to drive the story along and give some of the background on V he never falls into the realm of cliche.  You feel his pain and understand his persistence.  He is (belatedly) searching for the truth behind his government and ultimately his life.<br /><br />Also contributing to cause it John Hurt and a truly wonderful score.  Set design and lighting are well thought out too.  The lighting has to do double duty as it has to help Weaving express the correct emotion. Remember that Weaving is acting behind a rather silly mask so lighting and cinematography have to be spot on, there is no room for error.<br /><br /> The only real weakness in V is the premise itself. No not that the UK has slipped into fascist terror state.  Both the UK and US are just few \\"Allah Akbar\\"s from that terrible future.  No it is that one person in a Guy Faulks mask pulls a somnolent public back to a freedom loving mass of citizenry in only one year.  If we ever fall down the rabbit hole of Fascism it will take more than few pounds of C-4 and a knife-throwing vigilante to set things right.at terrible future.

B000H7JD4K|1.0|Why does this album have such good ratings???  Because all the bad reviews get deleted or don't show up at all!  I wrote a review a few days ago! It never showed up! ONLY the 5 star reviews show up! I'll be surprised if this one shows up at all! <br /> <br />  This album is very dull with no variety! I can't even listen to it & I'm a huge Maiden fan! Bruce sings every song the same lately. BOOOORING!!!!!!
B00005JOUO|4.0|Clive Owens is the reason this movie is brilliant. Of course Denzel and Foster are going to deliver, but Owens shines the most in this one. This has to be the first Spike Lee movie I've seen that did not look or had the feel of a typical Spike Lee film. I was expecting more in this movie because of the confusing plot, but it did what it could. Clive Owens will get an Oscar soon, maybe more than one if he picks the right roles.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Since vocalist Bruce Dickinson returned to Iron Maiden back in 1999, the band has put out studio efforts Brave New World (2000) which was great, if it didn't break any new ground.  This was followed in 2003 by Dance of Death which saw the band striking out a bit sonically and try some different things. Some worked, some didn't and it also didn't help that the production on the album sounded awful & choked.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was worried that the band has already started to begin another serious rut with Dance of Death considering what happened with the quality of their material throghout the 90s.<br /><br />Upon listening to their new studio release A Matter of Life and Death, all of my worries have been squashed and I can easily say that this is the best effort that they've done since Bruce has been back in the band.<br /><br />The album has a much darker feel than the last 2 releases, with most of the songs dealing with war in some way or another.  The lyrices though aren't trite and are very thoughtfully put together.  I think that this can be seen as a result of Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith had a much bigger hand in writing on this release.<br /><br />Recorded very shortly in just a matter of 2 months, the album has a bite and vitality that finds the band firing on all cylinders.  While the album is only 10 songs, the CD clocks in a little over 72 minutes.  The songs have a progressive nature to them on this release that is kind of reminiscent of their late 80's and even 1995's ill received X-Factor musically.<br /><br />The album also has very crips sound to it and doesn't have the \\"choked\\" sound that the last 2 albums (especially Dance of Death) exhibited. This is even more surprising since bassist Steve Harris decided not to have the CD mastered which kicked off a firestorm of controversy as people thought the CD would sound like [...]<br /><br />But a lot of people aren't really schooled in what mastering is and what it can do both good/bad to a release anyway.  This new CD was mastered, but apparently Steve thought that unmastered version had a much better sound to it.<br /><br />I have to say it  was a great decision. Everything is crisp and clear.  And the CD is as loud as other CD's without the levels peaking out way too much like a lot of modern CD's seem to annoyingly do.<br /><br />The songs are long without being long winded. The shortest track is the 1st song Different Worlds.  The longest track is the closer The Legacy which was co-written by Steve Harris and Janick Gers. While I have question the relevancy of keeping Janick in the band after they got back both Bruce & Adrian, he seems to really have come into his own finally on this release.<br /><br />Does this compare to their classic 80's material?  To be honest, not quite.  Was I expecting it to be ? No.  If I want to listen to their old stuff, I'll listen to the old stuff.  But the material on this new CD shows a veteran metal act that isn't falling on just past glories and still have plenty to say.  This is one that will remain in your player for a good while after you buy it. Good stuff indeed!mastered, but apparently Steve thought that unmastered version had a much better sound to it.

B000GRTQSE|4.0|>   With this band he's been playing with   on tour for the last two years Bob is   tighter and more swinging in his musical   blast than ever before.     The result is First class! Well up to   his usual standard. Not quite as good   or original as Love & Theft (to my ears).   Songs and music based on boogie, dancehall,   cowboy, R&B, traditional,(in other words: very   authentically musical, you find yourself moving   to the rhythm as always with Dylan), you feel   you know the tune well but can't put your finger   on it, clever couplets in the lyrics, a lot of   truisms and wisdom in there, most lyrics pertain   to him and a lady friend and he's addressing   her personally (whether the same one each time   is anybody's guess?), loads of lyrics - makes   you wonder how he can have the patience   to write it all down.    One obvious political/social comment song on   the New Orleans flood. Other than that I   don't really know what he's going on about   half the time, other than despite that it's   entertaining. One or two outstandingly   hit ballad tunes. Voice holding up well.   If Love and Theft scored 9 out of 10 this   hits about 7. It would be nice to have   Bob getting back to more pointed lyrics,   and less obliqueness. I've listened about   four times so far. Dylan plays here as   part of a tight-nit combo. Musicianship   immaculate as you'd expect.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Bob Dylan feels good about his music and you will to. There was a period in time after the sixties, and before the Modern Times, where Dylan sort of just went through the motions and put out some extremely goofy and just plain lousy music. It was a very short period of time, but it took him years to overcome. In 1993 critics said that the man was all done, and for the first time in 30 years Bob Dylan took a walk around his block and nobody cared. It was the greatest day of his life.<br /><br />Then no more than seven years later he put 3 more Grammys and an Oscar under his belt. Now he just stays on the road constantly, and puts out some of the greatesrt music I've ever heard.  More laid back than ever with his newest disc, Dylan once again astounds. I can't stand the people who have compared any of Dylans last three albums to his sixties material. It's a whole different show all together. The old man showers his wisdom down as if he was himself no longer a man, but a legend. A ghost. Died in '97, remember?<br /><br />And he's not just one ghost, but a whole crew of them at once. Ones that have followed him from the very first album, and new ones that he's picked up along the way. The tour is \\"neverending\\", and at one point he struggled with his place in life, and in fame. Now he owns it, and it sounds so good. What makes these modern times so intense, is the fact that he makes it all sound just like a dream.<br /><br />They are calling this the third part of a trilogy now. Making 97's TIME OUT OF MIND part one, and 2001's \\"Love and Theft\\" part two. I don't really get it, because those two albums were completely different from each other, and really so is this disc. More relative to 83's Infidels album than anything from Time Out of Mind. A very relaxed groove, where every song allows you to paint your own story in your head, rather than form an opinion of the world around you. Dirty women and religion are tossed in for good measure, maybe to activate your left and right brains at once, which causes you after a few listens to not only want to hear more and more, but also triggers something that wasn't there before. You may find yourself dusting off those 80's Dylan albums and hearing them in a whole new light. The ghosts want you to this. Its hard to believe that he is the greatest man alive. Or dead. But I can definately say he's better than anybody else.at once, which causes you after a few listens to not only want to hear more and more, but also triggers something that wasn't there before.

If you're a metal fan, but you don't own this album yet, then buy this album right now! <br />Also, don't forget to pick up A Matter Of Life And Death. That is the newest Maiden album, and my favorite. <br /> <br />But about this album again, it is a great one. Buy it, you won't be disapointed I'm sure.
0394800184|1.0|First, let me say that I learned to read from this book. When I was a kid I knew all the words and I loved it! But then again, I didn't know any better, and frankly, neither did my mom and dad. I was lucky in that the book applied to me: I looked like my mom and dad and therefore the message of the book, that your mother is the one who looks most like you, was seemingly harmless.<br /><br />Now, however, I have an adopted son and am friends with many other families created through adoption, including lots of families with children of different races. The message of this book is really inappropriate for those families and even though my adopted son happens to be physically similar to me, it's not a message I want him to hear, either. Families don't have to look alike to be family!<br /><br />One of the earlier comments mentions A Mother for Choco by Keiko Kaska and I think this is a MUCH BETTER book than Are You My Mother for ANY child, not just a child in an adoptive or transracial family. The message of that book is that your mother is the one who mothers you...not necessarily the one who looks just like you.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|This album could be the best album Iron Maiden has ever released. This is a very complex, progressive and epic metal album. Bruce Dickinson sings fantastic again and with a higher voice then on Brave New World and Dance Of Death. The rest of the band is also fantastic. Nicko McBrain(drummer) has never played this good on any other Iron Maiden album, he's surely is one of the best drummers. The lyrics are very good and interesting, they are about war and religion. They have tackled that subject before, but never this good. I'm not gonna discribe all the songs, you may find that out yourself, buy this album, it won't disapoint any metal fan. This is highly intelligent metal, so take the time to listen to it.  <br />IRON MAIDEN RULES!
B00005JKQ6|5.0|My husband couldn't believe that Burt Lancaster stayed in his bathing suit the entire film!!! He laughed out loud!  There's something strangely compelling about Lancaster.  Even though he was 55 at the time the movie was made he was incredible.  He had real star quality.   <br /> <br />Star Trek fans will delight at seeing a very stunning Diana Muldaur.  I've always thought she was pretty but to see her in her hey day she'll knock your socks off!!!!!  Just stunning. There's also a cameo of Joan Rivers.  Watching this movie takes me back to how my parents were before the divorce not unlike Ned.  <br /> <br />I read this short story before I ever knew it was made into a movie.  It's about a yuppie gone wrong.  This story is just as relevant today as it was when it was made.  This movie speaks about materialism, mass consumption and the degeneracy of society. <br /> <br />The ending leaves you saying \\"What??\\"  If you like nostalgia this movie's for you.
0312995423|1.0|This book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually NO understanding of computer systems by the author. I don't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving, but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes, firewalls and hacking techniques, those details must be fairly correct. In this case, the technical details were so wildly implausible that I finally had to stop reading. The part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access NSA data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details. The NSA almost certainly doesn't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet (through any combination of firewalls) but if they did, they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked.  <br />Besides all that that, the characters were cliched and not well developed. <br />This is all too bad, because the plot was interesting and I would have kept reading if the technical details were either accurate or just avoided

1400032717|4.0|An earlier review says that this book \\"pales in comparison\\" to Flowers for Algernon.  That reader obviously missed what makes this book great.  With all due respect to Daniel Keyes, the messages of Algernon are in-your-face obvious, while The Curious Incident is often more subtle and layered.  Everything from the run-on sentences to the nearly random digressions deepen your understanding of Christopher's character and how he sees the world.<br /><br />I've got a couple of suggestions to help you enjoy this book.  First, you've got to accept that the events of the book are nothing more than a context in which to watch Christopher.  By the middle of the book the actual plot line has become predictable, but Christopher himself has become an absolutely enthralling character to observe.  You often know what's going to happen next, but Christopher's reaction is much harder to guess.<br /><br />Second, learn a little about autism before you read the book.  You are much more likely to pick up on the subtleties that way.  From the negative reviews I have read, it's obvious that Christopher's oddities are just plain irritating unless you have some clue as to why he is the way he is.  A little background goes a long way toward developing empathy for Christopher.<br /><br />There are quite a few F-bombs scattered throughout the book.  If that's something you care about, consider yourself warned.<br /><br />The end of the book left me feeling a little unsettled at first, but after I had some time to absorb it I thought it was the perfect ending.  Several people's lives have been turned completely upside down, but Christopher honestly believes everything is back to normal and OK again.  To Christopher, things have been resolved.  It's only the reader who realizes how unresolved and out of balance things still are.  I'm sure the author intended for us to have that unsettled feeling.<br /><br />Overall I'm giving the book 4 stars instead of 5 because it does require a particular frame of mind to enjoy.ticular frame of mind to enjoy.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|My punk rock and jazz preferences usually keep me many standard deviations over from mainstream pop. I haven't liked a Madonna song since \\"Live to Tell\\" which, by the way, is a perfectly appropriate Diva smackdown from Madonna back to JLo's comment that Madonna can't sing (\\"try hitting those notes with that sustain, you half-range pudding pants you\\").<br /><br />I was shocked, shocked! to discover \\"Madonna\\" was the artist for the arresting song \\"Get Together.\\" Madonna's new beaux apparently is Brian Eno, for this album is rich in synthesizers and aural textures, sounds both to dance and dream to.<br /><br />Additional stand out selections from Confessions on a Dance Floor are \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Forbidden Love\\" but the whole album has an organic quality that merges one song to another. It is almost as if Madonna has finally been listening to Bryan Ferry, Kraftwerk, and Enigma and made her own take on lush synthesizer dance pop to remind us all of how compelling it can be.<br /><br />One flaw is the song \\"Jump.\\" While this will sooth with a luxuriant originality to most listeners under 35, anyone older will immediately remember Gershon \\"Hot Butter\\" Kingsley's 1971 hit \\"Popcorn.\\"<br /><br />Deserves every single star, my hat is off to the lady.
0385512058|4.0|I was in the middle of reading Keith's book and took it with me on a recent cruise vacation.  I recognized the same book being read by a fellow traveler and introduced myself.  We chatted about the book and our businesses and exchanged business cards.  The presence of the book itself was the perfect introduction to our conversation!  Fun, fabulous, and completely natural is how I would describe Keith Ferrazzi's approach to building a network as wide (and deep) as you want.
B000002AH7|3.0|Miles Davis is a jazz icon and as such is the recipient of much unqualified adulation.  This reverence really misses the point and does him a disservice, because what was best about Davis, apart from his incredible creativity and sensitivity, was his complete irreverence.  Abrasive, moody, arrogant, misogynistic, vain, and downright hostile, Davis could abuse drugs and alcohol with the best of his cohorts, but unlike most of them, lived a long life in spite of it.  Consequently he was able to ride the waves of numerous changes in jazz, and make huge contributions to them.  Few, if any, players had one foot on the bandstand with Bird and the other with Herbie Hancock.  But that doesn't mean that everything that happened in between was wonderful.<br /><br />Sketches Of Spain is an excellent example.  This is truly one of the most overrated CDs in all of jazz.  Much has been made of it, the evocative imagery, the sense of place, the tension, but it doesn't stand up to return visits.  Try it on for size now.  It resembles nothing more closely than a mountain of Velveeta cheese melting in slow motion beneath a hot, Spanish sun.  For some bizarre reason, Evans and Davis decided to milk a handful of uninteresting figures endlessly; the pieces don't develop so much as ooze, like oil descending marble stairs.  Perhaps the greatest flaw is that, apart from the instrumentation, there is nothing here even remotely reminiscent of jazz.<br /><br />It is the nature of great, and brave, artists like Davis to fail magnificently, this is part of what is admirable about them.  In this respect, and only in this respect, should Sketches Of Spain be celebrated.
6305648522|1.0|I'm giving one star not for the film but for this version only. The director's cut has more than 50 mins additional footage which is vital to the story and was cut to make the film more acceptable to cinema audiences. With these additional scenes, this is an excellent 5-star movie but otherwise, viewers will be unsatisfied. The main bone of contention is that the Elena relationship is not properly resolved in the shorter version so you'll be left wondering how it all turned out. Take my advice, pay a little more and get the full-length version. You won't regret it.
6304458304|5.0|Review Clarification:  This review is based on my viewing of this movie in the theater, and on Laser Disc.  I have not viewed the DVD (any version).<br /><br />This is my favorite Clint Eastwood movie of all time, better than all the Dirty Harry, Spaghetti Western,  and Sci-Fi/Space movies.<br /><br />I first viewed this movie in the theater, and I was completely blown away.  I am disappointed that John Malkovich has chosen not to be in more mainstream movies, because I immediately wanted to see everything he was in, after watching this movie.  (I immediately rented \\"Being John Malkovich\\" when it became available, and was quite disappointed when he was not the protagonist.) John plays a brilliant Psycho in this movie, and plays it very well.  In fact, I actually changed my image of him after this movie. If I were to see him on the street, this is the only memory I would have of him.<br /><br />I recommend this movie highly.  One of my favorites.<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!<br /><br />EDIT: Why list the director's name first, Wolfgang Petersen, instead of Clint Eastwood?  Stupid!

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie is now my favorite and #1 best movie of its kind I have seen.  The plot is developed early on and keeps the viewer riveted to the screen.  You don't realize how much this movie pulls you in until the very end and there is no more to see.  You don't want the movie to end.  The cast is superbly acted and the camera shots help you to feel as if you are really there watching.  The best part, I can let my Grandchildren watch.  This movie doesn't need steamy scenes to get the point across.

B000004CYT|5.0|This set is excellent.  I love Hogwood and his approach to these symphonies.  Instead of playing Beethoven according to contemporary orchestral practices, Hogwood brings us back to the correct size and sound of Beethoven's day, and in doing so delivers one of the most interesting and lively recordings of these immortal symphonies.  The Beethoven one hears on these discs is an exciting one, the music is vibrant, alive and...yes, even fun at times!  Hogwood plays Beethoven the way he should be played, with an authentic orchestra and authentic timings.  The instruments sound fresh and alive, and the quality of the recording is excellent, the music sounds clean and direct.  I highly recommend this incredible set, and I want to say thank you to Mr. Hogwood for creating my favorite set of Beethoven's symphonies!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool is a band that you can't just have on as background noise or listen to casually.  You CAN, but you won't get the full effect.  Wings for Marie and 10,000 Days(Wings Pt. 2) put together may just be one of the deepest, thought provoking songs I have ever heard.  Written about lead singer Maynard's late mother who was deeply religious her whole life only to be paralyzed from a stroke for the last 27 years of her life (ie- 10,000 days...get it?).  Some of the lyrics come across as instructions from a frustrated and angry son who not only couldn't understand her blind faith but also how a saint like Marie couldn't be allowed in Heaven on a red carpet.  Example: \\"It's time now, my time now, give me my, give me my wings.\\"  Before anyone writes off this album, they need to delve deeper into the psyche of the album.  How many would have to guts to say for someone to demand to allowed into heaven after the hell that they were put through in life.  That's what music should be.  Otherwise, there's always Weezer.  This isn't a bad album from Tool, it's a masterpiece.  Like Metallica has, Tool also has grown up with it's music.  They're not going to make another Undertow, just as Metallica isn't going to make another Puppets or Justice.  They aren't in the same place in life that they were when they made it.  The bands that do and keep making the same type of music usually aren't around long enough to do it.  See them live if you can!!

0553278223|5.0|The Martian Chronicles are a mixed work by the Science Fiction master, Ray Bradbury, sometimes functioning just to entertain, but at most times functioning to comment on the inhumanity of man. <br /> <br />A theme that runs throughout several of his stories is the arrogant and often-provincial nature of humanity.  One of the opening stories deal with the desires of man for recognition while everyone he encounters thinks that he is mad.  (It wouldn't be a long stretch to say that this same story also is a commentary on euthanasia.)  Other stories discuss the provincial nature of man, who so very often is appalled by that which is unfamiliar.  Bradbury's apologetic on this is aimed against such closed-minded philosophy of life, as its inherent lack of dialogue precludes any exchange of beauty but instead locks mankind into a downward spiral, locked inward on himself. <br /> <br />The exodus to Mars ultimately calls man back, as he does not feel at home in the new world.  In the end, mankind's attachment to the homeland is Mars' defeat of mankind.  Bradbury doesn't speculate much on morality of this choice but does outline the disastrous outcome of all the iniquity of man compounded together on Earth. <br /> <br />Throughout Bradbury's other stories, he either whimsically tells a tale of encounters on the Red Planet or reflects on other fears which he had for mankind. <br /> <br />It is difficult to tie all of these together on one string other than that of \\"beware of your fallen self, o mankind.\\"  Bradbury raises valid questions about mankind's tendencies and philosophical quandaries.  The work is not a feel-good type of book but instead presents a challenging view for the reader's reflection.
0780622553|5.0|Cult films don't come much more groundbreaking than \\"Dark City\\" -- it was bending reality before the Matrix ever did, and with less obvious messages.<br /><br />At first glance, Alex Proyas' spellbinding movie seems like a pretty basic story -- a seemingly ordinary man is pitted against the mysterious aliens who control his world. But it is far more than that. It's a dark grimy nightmare where nothing is what it seems, and everything we think is real is just an elaborate illusion, suffused with murky noir atmosphere and a mesmerizingly creepy band of villains. This is one of the rare films that is sublime from start to finish.<br /><br />The Strangers are pasty-faced, bald, leather-coat-wearing aliens (think Darth Vader, post-mask), whose survival depends on somehow imitating human souls and dreams. So they created the Dark City, to observe and manipulate the unwitting humans.<br /><br />John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up naked in a tub, with no memory of who he is, and a brutally murdered woman in the hotel room outside. Police inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) and the cops are hunting him for a series of murders, but John is sure he didn't murder anyone. He also is the only who seems to notice that the Dark City is perpetually night. And he's the only one who doesn't spontaneously fall into a coma at midnight, which is when the the Strangers appear.<br /><br />Who are the Strangers? Pasty, bald aliens inhabiting dead bodies who appear every night to rearrange the world. Buildings are reshaped, people's memories change, and some people's whole lives are altered. And before long, John discovers that the strangers are after him because he can \\"tune\\" reality as they do.<br /><br />As John struggles to figure out what is real and what is manufactured by the Strangers, he encounters the eccentric scientist Dr. Shreber (Kiefer Sutherland), who creates the fake memories that the Strangers inject into people's brains. As Shreber tries to help him achieve his destiny, the Strangers send Mr. Hand (Richard O'Brien) -- who has the false memories intended for John -- to find what makes him different from all other humans.<br /><br />\\"Dark City\\" is often considered the predecessor of \\"The Matrix\\" -- they both deal with dark-suited people who manipulate the real world, the fluidity of memory and reality, and a single messianic figure who may be the key to stopping them with his reality-warping powers. But \\"Dark City\\" is less of a blockbuster, and more of an eerie cult movie that begs to be watched and rewatched, dissected and reexamined.<br /><br />And Alex Proyas gives this movie a fascinating vibe -- it's dark, angular, and haunted, like if Fritz Lang made a sci-fi noir. The Dark City is a pretty creepy place, like a... well, like a city at night, with some surreal skyscrapers, big cogs and giant clocks. The streets are mostly empty and the citizens seem to walk through life in a half-awake fog, and even everyday actions like eating soup or doing paperwork achieve a strangely unreal quality. When the occasional person like Bumstead -- able to pierce the veil of lies and false memories -- comes along, it seems to cut through the strange eerieness.<br /><br />But it's also paired with a very suspenseful script, which is equal parts surrealism and gnostic philosophy. All the dialogue is well written (\\"You know something, I don't think the sun even... exists... in this place\\"), and very spare, as if the characters have mostly pre-programmed responses to things. But Proyas makes all the dialogue weirdly disconnected, as if the characters are never really communicating fully. It adds to the dreamlike feeling.<br /><br />Sewell is mesmerizingly good as John Murdoch, moving seamlessly from confusion to skepticism to a pretty wild action scene where he clashes with all the Strangers on a scaffold. He forms a trinity of sorts with Hurt's Bumstead, a capable and intelligent cop who begins to realize that his entire world doesn't make sense,and Sutherland's Peter Lorre-like Shreber as a scientist whose nervous gasps and scarring hint at how the Strangers have treated him. Underused but quite good is Jennifer Connelly, as the conflicted nightclub singer who MIGHT be Murdoch's unfaithful wife... but probably not.<br /><br />And as the opposition, we have the incomparable Richard O'Brien as one of the Strangers who achieves a small amount of humanity, and seems to like it -- one beautiful little scene has him talking with Emma (whom he now has husbandly memories of) about the nature of memory and how his species has \\"no experiences to call your own.\\"<br /><br />Like Kafka on acid, like a dark comic book brought to life, \\"Dark City\\" is a fascinatingly dreamlike sci-fi movie, with the mesmerizing design and the complicated plot.

0679422714|5.0|Having recently read a biographies of Cary Grant, I find the the negative reviews of this book so similar and equally clueless.  While Cary Grant was no world leader, he was also a master of presenting a picture to the public.  In the criticisms of the Cary Grant biography, people would say \\"I can't believe he would have done this or that. He just seemed like too nice a guy on the screen.\\" Acting is acting.  In the criticisms of Mao, they say well if he was so bad, how could he have been so successful in gaining power and how could Chiang been so clumsy and lose so badly. Well, look at Stalin, look at Hitler, look at Pol Pot. They were all evil, but they were willing to do anything to gain their ends.  <br /> <br />Look at John Wayne Gacy.  From Wikipedia: He was convicted and later executed for the rape and murder of 33 boys and young men, 29 of whom he buried in the crawl space under his house, between 1972 and his arrest in December 1978. He became notorious as the \\"Killer Clown\\" because of the many block parties he attended, entertaining children in a clown suit and makeup. He became a prominent and respected member of the community. [He lived ]a double life: respected member of the community by day, sexual predator and murderer by night.
6305657947|5.0|In 1968 there was a little caper film titled The THomas Crown Affair starring the ever-cool Steve McQueen and a radiant Faye Dunaway. The film was considered hip, cool and sexy in its way during the late 60's. It took 31 years, but a remake was finally made of this film but this time around starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in the roles originally played by McQueen and Dunaway. With some great direction from thriller and action filmmmaker John McTiernan, 1999's The Thomas Crown Affair ends up being the exception to the rule of remakes of older films turning out lesser than the original. This modern and updated version of The Thomas Crown Affair actually surpasses the original McQueen production. McTiernan's film ably combines humor, thrilling action set pieces, sexy chemistry between the leads and just a beautifully shot film.<br /><br />Set in New York that never looked as good as shot by McTiernan and his crew, Pierce Brosnan stars and shines as the title character Thomas Crown. Thomas Crown is a suave, roguish and successful businessman who has everything a man could ask for: money, power and any woman he desires. What does a man like Crown would ever want in life? The film looks at this and shows that no amount of money in the world could replace the adrenaline rush and thrill of getting acquiring it. Crown does this by staging a complex and elaborate plan to steal a Monet from the NY Metropolitan Arts Museum and do so in the middle of the day. His plan goes off without a hitch and with none the wiser.<br /><br />With the heist completed, the film soon introduces Crown's foil in the form of Rene Russo as insurance investigator Catherine Banning. Ms. Russo never looked more beautiful, sensual and sexy as she did in this film. Her performance as the determined and crafty Banning more than holds up to Brosnan's roguish and playful performance as Thomas Crown. From the moment she appears on-screen as the camera slowly pans up her silky-stocking leg and garters, Russo dominated the scene and pretty much commanded attention from everyone. This was especially true whenever she shared the screen with Denis Leary as police detective in charge of investigating the Monet heist. Leary's always a strong performer in any film he's in but was pretty much lost in the wake of Russo's performance when both were on the screen.<br /><br />The rest of the film was pretty much Crown and Banning trying to get into each others' heads to find the one advantage that would give them an upper-hand in the \\"game\\" they've both decided to play. It's hard to see who is chasing who in the film. Is Banning chasing Crown as her one and only suspect for the theft or is Crown playing her as part of a much more complicated scheme to spice his life. These questions swirl within the frame of the heist investigation and the growing relationship between the two strong-willed characters.<br /><br />To say that Brosnan and Russo's on-screen chemistry was strong would be a big understatement. The two pretty much sizzle when together. Whether it's a playful, flirtation during a nice dinner out on the town to the two steamy dance numbers in the middle of the film. When Crown asks Banning if she wanted to dance or does she want to dance the temperature just went up by degrees. Their love scenes together shows that it could still be done with class and also have a sense of playfulness and fun.<br /><br />There's not much else to say about McTiernan's remake of the Thomas Crown Affair than to say that he took a good film, that showcased Steve McQueen's coolness for everyone to see, and made a much more superior production in every sense. The direction was excellent and the cinematography was beautiful in every second shot. The cast performance was very strong with the two leads in Brosnan and Russo acting their hearts out on the screen. This film shows that remakes really are not bad ideas when put into capable hands. It would be nice to see how the sequel --- tentatively titled The Topkapi Affair ---  to this film turns out with pretty much the same cast and crew returning. I, for one, will be there to see it when it comes out.--- tentatively titled The Topkapi Affair ---  to this film turns out with pretty much the same cast and crew returning.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|Between the book Chronicles, the cover of Rolling Stone, the PBS documentary can there be any doubt that Dylan is in the midst of a resurgence in popularity and being discovered by younger people perhaps for the first time. The trick is to do this not as some nostalgia act but to do it as only Dylan could and produce recordings that are as inspired both lyrically and musically as anything he's ever done.<br /><br />Let's face it - this man has still got it. A true artist and he's found a sound with this band that compliments his voice and lyrics perfectly. Just amazingly good American folk-rock at it's best from the master.
B00005JP5J|5.0|The summer of 2006 flicks just keep getting better!  First we had the brilliant and hillarious writing of Kevin Smith in \\"Clerks 2\\", then the fun of \\"Snakes on a Plane.\\"  And now comes the sleeper \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\".  The fantastic performances take what on the page is simply a cute little movie and elevate it to a comedic gem!    Greg Kinnear - this guy keeps getting better and better with every film; playing the tightly-wound father obsessed with his \\"9 steps\\" program for success, he walks a fine line between annoying and sympathetic; his support of Olive at the pageant is hysterical and heart-warming    Toni Collette - she's got the most difficult role: playing the straight man to everyone else, and she does it well, providing the perfect balance    Abigail Breslin - in the wrong hands, the character could have been just another \\"cute kid\\" role; but Breslin never goes that route and keeps Olive real.  It's nice to see a young actress actually act rather than just be cute.    Steve Carrell - a thankfully restrained performance from Carrell; here's another role that could've been a huge cliché - the gay uncle - but Carrell thankfully never takes the character in that direction, giving him dignity and a brilliant subtle humor    Alan Arkin - he's got the easiest role here as the eccentric profane grandpa whom Olive adores; the audience is clearly supposed to think he's funny, and Arkin plays the role well.  His scene in the van where he tells 15 year-old Dwayne how he should being living his life (which I won't spoil by revealing the details) is one of the funniest scenes in the movie    Paul Dano - the press is giving Steve Carrell most of the praise for this movie (Carrell is the It Boy of the moment, after all), but for me, the hands down best performance in this film goes to Paul Dano, who has the extremely difficult task of bringing 15 year-old Dwayne to life.  Making the job even harder is the fact that the character does not speak until the last reel ofthe film!  But even without words, Dano still imbues Dwayne with hilarity, intelligence, and dignity.  If anyone should win an award for this film, it's Dano - no question.    One other great thing about this film:  the teaser posters - which feature the notes written by Dwayne - are a brilliant marketing idea. Who wouldn't want to know more about a film with a poster that simply reads \\"I Hate Everyone\\" :)
B000FSME1A|5.0|<br />When Francis Ford Coppola brought out a 202 minute version of APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX in 2001, he told everyone that this was his final cut, that the original negative for APOCALYPSE NOW (1979) no longer existed because it had been edited for REDUX.  Fortunately for all film scholars and movie lovers, Coppola did not tell the truth.  Both films--the 153 minute original and REDUX--are together on a new two disk DVD from Paramount Home Video. <br /> <br />It is an awkward set because the first half of both movies is on disk one and the second half of both movies is on disk two.  Special features are on both disks, which have been packaged to look like Captain Willard's dossier on Colonel Kurtz.  But the transfers are magnificent, probably supervised by Coppola and sound designer/head editor Walter Murch.  And maybe spectacular cinematographer Vittorio Storaro.  The wide-screen photography, seemingly at a 1.85 ratio and not 2.35 \\"scope\\", has brilliant color beyond what I saw in a theater.  And the sound design is awesome with just stereo headphones--less so when listening to Coppola's thoughtful and revealing audio commentary for both movies.  So watch the movies again without the commentary! <br /> <br />What has been added to REDUX to make it what I personally agree with Coppola is a more rich and complex movie dramatically?  A major sequence in part two with a French plantation lost in the foggy past for a burial and an elaborate dinner.  An additional scene with Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz to partially justify the egotistical actor's ludicrous top billing for only a few last reel scenes.  More footage with Robert Duvall's Lt. Kilgore to help justify HIS unjustified second billing above leading man Martin Sheen, who is third billed and in every scene as Captain Willard.  And an additional, very good scene on a rainy and ghostly abandoned airfield with the Playboy Playmates inside a plane for sex and chatting with Willard's crew. <br /> <br />It is great that the original 1979 film still exists intact for purists who find nothing wrong with it.  Colonel Willard's mission during the Vietnam War is to go up a river out of Saigon (location filming was done in the Phillippines) with a small PT boat crew.  It is a journey into Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS (Coppola's admitted source, despite John Milius' original screenplay).  It is a journey into fog and madness, more and more surreal, until they reach the deep jungle compound of Brando's madman Kurtz.  Willard's mission is to assassinate Kurtz.  The movie--both movies--are \\"R\\"-rated for strong violence, strong language, some drug use, and some sex with the Playmates.  If you have children, try to put them to bed first.  Even on home video alone in a bedroom, this is a very strong and powerful movie experience.  I think both films are masterpieces that Coppola can be very proud of.  And I still think Sheen should have gotten top billing and an Oscar nomination in 1979. <br /> <br />What kind of bonus material do we have on the two-disk dossier DVD edition?  Lots of good stuff.  Besides an audio commentary by Coppola for both movies, we have small featurettes on the sound design and visual look of APOCALYPSE NOW/REDUX.  There is a cast member reunion, a featurette on the lush song score and instrumental score by Carmine and Francis Coppola, Brando reading all of THE HOLLOW MEN (he actually is very fine and chilling in this Joseph Conrad role that is basically a glorified cameo), a \\"lost\\" scene, and additional cutting room floor scenes for those who can't get enough at even 202 minutes. <br /> <br />This DVD is a worthy addition to the collection of anyone who loves the work of Coppola, Sheen, John Milius, exotic adventure films, and/or Vietnam dramas.  I also think Conrad and his admirers would be fascinated by it.  It is reasonably priced at $20, but Amazon is practically giving it away at $13.87.  And, of course, it is rentable from Netflicks. <br /> <br />
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing...I can't think of a better word to describe it. I can just listen to the music and close my eyes and I feel like I'm actually watching the movie. Klaus Bandelt did a wonderful job on this music. Even if this wasn't a movie soundtrack, the music would still be amazing. Everytime I listen I want to watch the movie. It's great for long car trips because you can listen to it from the first track to the last, which is the best way to listen to this soundtrack. I recommend buying this CD if you loved The Curse of the Black Pearl.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This is a fantastic movie about the HMS Surprise, commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey, stalking the French vessell Acheron to the \\"far side of the world\\" during the Napoleanic era.  The filem is intricately detailed, and while I am no sailor, most of the details strike true.  I do know that the British Navy by the time of this story absolutely revered Lord Nelson, and that reverance is played out in this movie when several younger offciers ask the Captain for impressions of Nelson during one of his two meeting with the Admiral.  The cannons have names, the bells number the hours of the shipboard day.  A knotted rope line is played out to measure the ship's speed in knots.  A sounding is taken to read the depth of the sea, and sextant lessons are given to measure true noon.  In fact the level of detail is overwhelming, but the story is just as good.    The Acheron is the superior ship, and at first it seems the Captain is also superior.  He surprises the Surprise twice, once coming out of the fog at the beginning of the movie and once by hiding in an inlet and letting the Surprise chase on by.  Captain Aubry only barely manages to escape into the fog the first time, and into the night the second.    But in the end, Captain Aubrey wins out, but not before the ship and crew has made many sacrifices.    Russell Crowe's performance as Captain Jack Aubry is spectacular.  I was also immensley impressed with Max Pirkis's portrayal of young Mr. Blakeny.  The photography and camera work were absolutely first rate, as well as the tremendous attention to detail.    This is a really great movie on so many levels.  I highly recommend it.
0552998486|2.0|It really is hard to imagine a less important book than this. Perhaps the tedious Mills & Boone catalogue owns triviality, but this comes close. <br /> <br />I'm a fan of the movie with Johnny Depp and Juliet Binoche, but reading this book made me realise that has more to do with the colours, styling and performances than anything else. After the movie, I was left with a feeling of magic. The book has no such charm. <br /> <br />This story of an enigmatic woman and her daughter opening up a chocolate store in a small French town has all the appeal of setting and background story. It's quaint and it's lyrical, and that's the promise of this novel. <br /> <br />In reality, it's a dead-boring, formulaic, and utterly superficial story about a set of characters it's almost impossible to care about. The abused woman who leaves her husband; the old grandmother going blind; the prissy priest and the stuck-up town gossips. To say these are stereotypes does no justice to the depth of how cliched they actually are. <br /> <br />The central characters -- the chocolate proprietor and the river gypsy -- have some deeper layers, but more like a wafer biscuit than a chocolate cake. <br /> <br />In the end, one is left feeling nothing. Like the bland chocolate the book is at pains to differentiate the wares of its shop from, this book is a cheap thrill. And not even much of one.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Iron Maiden still reign supreme as the absolute Kings of Metal and have since their first disk back in 1980. Now, countless releases later, A Matter of Life and Death shows that the \\"Colours\\" are not running in the slightest on the Iron Maiden Flag.<br /><br />I remember back in 1999 hearing that Bruce and Adrian re-joined the band for Brave New World. That was indeed exciting news. After all, while they were out of the band they teamed up on two of Bruce's solo releases, and one of those releases, Accident of Birth, was as good as Maiden's Number of the Beast or Piece of Mind...I know...Blasphemous!<br /><br />And what a disk Brave New World was! That too was as good as any of the best Maiden albums ever released. 6 years and another release (Dance of Death) later, the Irons are still way up.<br /><br />A Matter of Life and Death is an Iron Maiden classic already. It's got the familiar sounds...you know...the ones we all have come to know and love over the past 26 years. The anthem choruses are there. The epic songs are there. The lead guitar duals are there.<br /><br />The three-guitar onslaught is there. But that's a relatively new sound that's only been around since Brave New World. And that sound is working on all Iron cylinders on A Matter of Life and Death.<br /><br />The first three tracks ring true to the sound established with Brave New World and Dance of Death. Track 3, Brighter Than a Thousand Suns, is an intricately woven together off time rocker that will be amazing to see pulled off live. Track 4 has that classic pre-Blaze years sound.<br /><br />The disk gets better as you get deeper in. Tracks 8 and 10 are both 9+ minute epics, and perhaps the two best tracks on the album. All the tracks have their own sound. And not one of them should be \\"judged by its cover\\"; often times the way a track starts is not indicative of what you get two minutes into it. But that's well known signature style for Maiden.<br /><br />Iron Maiden will not disappoint the die-hard fans with A Matter of Life and Death and they keep the sound refreshed enough to bring in new fans with every release. These guys are the epitome of Metal and the epitome of Metal done RIGHT.<br /><br />Don't pass on this one, folks.the sound refreshed enough to bring in new fans with every release.

0312340958|5.0|I applaud Karen Armstrong for having the guts to write this book. Although I am guessing that it was cathartic for her to review this period in her life, she wrote quite dispassionately about her experiences. It is remarkable to me that she did not play the role of victim. In fact, she showed more love and compassion to those who abused her than those who were supposed to guide her on the path to love.<br /><br />Her autobiography details the influences that led Karen to choose the life of being a nun. Years later, she is able to describe her youthful idealism is choosing such a life. Woven throughout the story are her reflections years later after she had chosen to leave the order.<br /><br />Through the Narrow Gate could be viewed as an indictment against the Roman Catholic Church or any other organization that thrives on abuse. Karen does not take that tact. She views everything as a lesson to be observed and learned from.<br /><br />The book was riviting. Karen laid out the familial, cultural and religious framework which made her susceptible for the horrors that she experienced during her training. It was barbaric and humiliating. Anyone going through it in these modern times would have sued.<br /><br />The book is truly an insiders view of what used to transpire behind the convent walls pre Vatican II. Thank goodness for those reforms.<br /><br />As I read Through the Narrow Gate, I felt challenged to review my own belief systems. I thought about my upbringing in Catholic schools and my religious training. I contrasted this with my current understandings. There was quite a chasm there for me. This was an unexpected benefit from the book.<br /><br />This book is not an expose filled with lurid details designed to titillate. It is the story of a love affair gone wrong, an abusive system and a woman seeking love and peace.

B000H7JD4A|5.0|Iron Maiden still reign supreme as the absolute Kings of Metal and have since their first disk back in 1980. Now, countless releases later, A Matter of Life and Death shows that the \\"Colours\\" are not running in the slightest on the Iron Maiden Flag.<br /><br />I remember back in 1999 hearing that Bruce and Adrian re-joined the band for Brave New World. That was indeed exciting news. After all, while they were out of the band they teamed up on two of Bruce's solo releases, and one of those releases, Accident of Birth, was as good as Maiden's Number of the Beast or Piece of Mind...I know...Blasphemous!<br /><br />And what a disk Brave New World was! That too was as good as any of the best Maiden albums ever released. 6 years and another release (Dance of Death) later, the Irons are still way up.<br /><br />A Matter of Life and Death is an Iron Maiden classic already. It's got the familiar sounds...you know...the ones we all have come to know and love over the past 26 years. The anthem choruses are there. The epic songs are there. The lead guitar duals are there.<br /><br />The three-guitar onslaught is there. But that's a relatively new sound that's only been around since Brave New World. And that sound is working on all Iron cylinders on A Matter of Life and Death.<br /><br />The first three tracks ring true to the sound established with Brave New World and Dance of Death. Track 3, Brighter Than a Thousand Suns, is an intricately woven together off time rocker that will be amazing to see pulled off live. Track 4 has that classic pre-Blaze years sound.<br /><br />The disk gets better as you get deeper in. Tracks 8 and 10 are both 9+ minute epics, and perhaps the two best tracks on the album. All the tracks have their own sound. And not one of them should be \\"judged by its cover\\"; often times the way a track starts is not indicative of what you get two minutes into it. But that's well known signature style for Maiden.<br /><br />Iron Maiden will not disappoint the die-hard fans with A Matter of Life and Death and they keep the sound refreshed enough to bring in new fans with every release. These guys are the epitome of Metal and the epitome of Metal done RIGHT.<br /><br />Don't pass on this one, folks.the sound refreshed enough to bring in new fans with every release.

038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle is basically a unique and creative look at the end of the world.  To me, Vonnegut is arguing that the dizzying progress of science and technology in the last century has made the total destruction of life on earth a frightening possibility, and it's not just the \\"bad guys\\" who threaten humanity with annihilation:  an equal threat comes from the well-intentioned but short-sighted, from the lonely or downtrodden, from the greatest superpower to the tiniest and poorest island nation.<br /><br />In other words, truly destructive technologies, once they exist, become a danger to the entire world regardless of the \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" reasons for which they were created, and regardless of whether they fall into the hands of the \\"good guys\\" or the \\"bad guys.\\"  Vonnegut seems to be saying that scientific advancements cannot exist in a moral vacuum, that scientists should take responsibility for what they're creating.  The need for extreme care in creating such destructive technologies is made all the more pressing because, according to Vonnegut, we as human beings are addicted to classifying ourselves into nations and religions and political parties, and then killing and dying for these classifications.<br /><br />Perhaps this is the importance of Vonnegut's invention of Bokononism, the religion of the island nation of San Lorenzo:  if Bokonoism offers one real truth to its followers, it's that the entire religion is made up, a \\"shameless lie.\\"  The result is that, instead of striving to live Bokononism as the only possible truth, Bokononists are easy going; they realize from the start that Bokononism itself is just another example of the uniquely Bokononist notion of \\"foma,\\" i.e., \\"harmless untruths that make you brave and happy and kind.\\"  If that's the case, there's no reason to kill others who disagree with you; instead you can focus on what really matters, which for Vonnegut seems to mean creating satisfying connections with other people.<br /><br />Cat's Cradle, then, is not only Vonnegut's plea for responsibility in the development of technology, but, perhaps even more fundamentally, it's the story of how we ought to simply learn to get along with each other.  Luckily, it also happens to be a wildly funny, perfectly crafted piece of fiction.  Great book.negut's plea for responsibility in the development of technology, but, perhaps even more fundamentally, it's the story of how we ought to simply learn to get along with each other.

0201633612|5.0|\\"Design Patterns\\" (GoF = Gang of Four) is a signicant and, in many ways, a difficult work for the modern reader (me) to digest.  The material in this book is highly self-referential: to understand a particular design pattern, it is important to be familiar with  many similar, if not all, design patterns. <br /> <br />I would like to offer a suggestion about an approach that worked well for me.  As an introduction to the patterns field, I first read \\"Head First Design Patterns\\", which offers a highly competent but light-hearted presentation of the same patterns covered by GoF.  The Head First book gave me a thorough overview of the patterns landscape, as well as gently drilling me on pattern application.  The Head First book goes out of its way to provoke the thinking reader, while being the most entertaining computer science text that I have ever read. <br /> <br />With this introduction, I found \\"Design Patterns\\" to be a much more accessible and friendlier work.
B0000027RL|5.0|1991- Nothing but a glut of Guns `n' Roses generic rip-offs that the kids are listening to on the radio and MTV. At the time I was 15 years old and I was listening to U2 and R.E.M. that I loved and still do but then the skies cleared and like manna from heaven Pearl Jam's `Ten' appeared. I bought this album, listened to it, and my musical universe expanded.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with `Ten' then all I will say is that it sounds like a blend of seventies rock with heart of punk in particular post-punk bands of the American Underground in the eighties. Bands like Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Doors, Kiss, Husker Du, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Black Flag, X, Mission of Burma as well as artists like U2, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young and Jethro Tull all went into the making of `Ten'. This album was a result of music being able to grow and develop without the snobbery that often pervades many underground scenes. That snobbery is the reason why Pearl Jam came in for some unjustified criticism from certain quarters.<br /><br />`Ten' is the biggest selling record of the grunge scene and it's no secret as to why it was so successful. Here was a record that spoke directly and honestly to every disenfranchised kid who was struggling to be heard by parents, teachers and even peers without being nihilistic or preachy. In a post-modern age where there is nothing really to believe in except nothing, `Ten' instilled in me the belief that music is the only thing that really matters and can feel a part of while still being completely alone. This album got me into the many, many other bands that may be greater, but `Ten' was the portal through which I passed and for a brief period in the early nineties we had our 1967 or 1976 and I only hope that today's new music fans will have theirs.<br /><br />This album is the reason why I have since then spent a fortune on records. I have bought 2500 records since `Ten' in the hope that I would find another that would move me like this did and I've not been disappointed.move me like this did and I've not been disappointed.  <br />
0786915749|5.0|I was first introduced to Dragonlance my senior year in high school.  I had spent the previous summer reading many Forgotten Realms novels, while at the same time listening to my friends rave about the world of Dragonlance.  Dragons of Autumn Twilight was actually my second Dragonlance novel I read (the first one being Kindred Spirits) and from beginning to end, I enjoyed it.  Dragons of Autumn Twilight is a great start to a wonderful trilogy.  It was unforgettable characters, unique landscapes, and powerful villains. <br />   I just recently finished reading Dragons of Autumn Twilight for the 5th time, and still I find myself being spellbound.
B00006L83N|5.0|I have 4 Symphony X albums, and I believe I have found their best music.  The Odyssey is tied with The Divine Wings Of Tragedy for my favorite Symphony X album.  The other 2 SX albums that I have are: Twilight in Olympus, and V The New Mythology Suite. They are great too. This album is definitely worth all 5 stars. Symphony X makes lots of amazing music.

B000EJ9MTW|2.0|First off, had this album not been in the \\"used bin\\" and sporting a very cool painted cover that made me recall the wild artwork of 70's Miles Davis, I would not even be on here to review it.  <br /> <br />Musically this disk sounds sepia-toned through the retro \\"Orange Amplifier production filter\\" courtesy of some producer whom might be living vicariously through these young lads, a la Lou Pearlman. Lyrically this is cotton candy, style over substance fashion-rock with some modern Strokes-attitude thrown in. Collectively it lacks the teeth of their retro-inspiration.  <br /> <br />I reccomend the first two Monster Magnet disks to anyone looking for a fresher band that pulled off these influences successfully. If you want to dive even deeper into more respectable waters, look into the Obsessed, St. Vitus and a band called Sleep...
B000BYA5G4|5.0|LoW is a literary masterpiece suffused with dark satire and gallows humor.  To see what I mean, read the following direct quotes or better yet, watch the film (at least once)for yourself:        \\"There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is: How do we arm the other eleven?\\"        \\"Back then, I didn't sell to Osama Bin Laden. Not because of moral reasons, but because he was always bouncing checks.\\"        \\"The reason I'll be released is the same reason you think I'll be convicted. I do rub shoulders with some of the most vile, sadistic men calling themselves leaders today. But some of these men are the enemies of your enemies. And while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss--the President of the United States, who ships more merchandise in a day than I do in a year--sometimes it's embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns. Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply forces he can't be seen supplying. So. You call me evil, but unfortunately for you, I'm a necessary evil.\\"        \\"Of all the weapons in the vast Soviet arsenal, nothing was more profitable than Avtomat Kalashnikova model of 1947. More commonly known as the AK-47, or Kalashnikov. It's the world's most popular assault rifle. A weapon all fighters love. An elegantly simple 9 pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood. It doesn't break, jam, or overheat. It'll shoot whether it's covered in mud or filled with sand. It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do. The Soviets put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their flag. Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian people's greatest export. After that comes vodka, caviar, and suicidal novelists. One thing is for sure, no one was lining up to buy their cars.\\"
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Let me start by saying I've never played the games, but I have watched my son play them.  The games are creepy to the extreme, and this movie manages to pull off the atmosphere perfectly.  Whether you are a game player or just a moviegoer, this film is a treat to the horror fan who loves an extra dollop of disturbing and sinister eeriness on their gore.<br /><br />Rose Da Silva (played expertly by Rahda Mitchell - Pitch Black, Man On Fire) knows there is something deeply wrong with her sleepwalking adopted daughter, Sharon.  Against the wishes of her husband Christopher (Sean Bean - Fellowship Of The Ring), Rose decides to take Sharon on a road trip back to Sharon's town of birth, Silent Hill.  Big mistake.<br /><br />After a run from police officer Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden - Young Catherine, Fantastic Four), Rose crashes her car on the border of the cordoned off city of Silent Hill, evacuated because of an underground mine fire.  When Rose regains consciousness, Sharon is gone and Officer Bennett is intent on arresting her.  That is, until the two women discover that Silent Hill is now shut off from the rest of the world by a gaping chasm.<br /><br />Rose and Cybil return to the town to look for Sharon, but the town is really messed up.  Signals over the radio and cell phones announce the coming of squishy, disgusting horrors, and the fallout siren announces the arrival of a strange, alternate dimension.  Sharon is still here, somewhere, and Rose will stop at nothing to find her little girl.<br /><br />This movie is ALL atmosphere.  The sinister ambiance, the gut-wrenching mood, will make you forget everything else.  The FX is great, not just with the surroundings but also with Mr. Triangle Head (who appears in a particular skin-ripping scene that will leave you retching or reaching for popcorn).  Alice Krige (Star Trek TNG as the Borg Queen) plays a very over-the-top religious leader to perfection.  And the ending will leave you gasping for air, if you have any breath left after your ride through this spooked out town.<br /><br />Note:  I couldn't help but hear Simply Red's song \\"Night Nurse\\" during Rose's foray into the basement.  You will see what I mean, then look up the song.  I'm twisted, but it fits.  'Silent Hill' is a definite purchase.

B000GRU6XS|3.0|Iron Maiden: love them or leave them. But I honestly think this is the best album since Dickinson came back. Production values are better (much better at least than \\"Dance of DEath\\"), Nicko's drumming is much stronger, crisp and clear, the song are less repetitive, fortunately Janick Gers does just a few solos. Overall, a very satisfactory effort. Dickinson is singing in very high tones almost all the time and this can be a little bit annoying, but he's at the top of his game. Very solid outpu by Maiden.
0395645662|5.0|It's been 13 years since I was in 5th grade, when my teacher read The Giver aloud to my class. I have read this book atleast a dozen times since then and everytime it makes me feel the same way it did 13 years ago: enlightened and more aware of the world around me. I can say with all confidence that this book changed me as a child and it's the book that made me want to read; it made me love reading. To any parent browsing this page, wondering if this would be a good investment for their child: please take a chance. While the subject matter may be \\"too mature\\" to some, I feel that it is too important to keep from any child.
B00003CXCW|1.0|Can't remember when I've seen a film with more depraved and pathetic characters than this.   A has-been silent screen star who lives in a sinister dark house surrounded by a gzillion of her own photos and a weirdo butler essentially kidnap a holiday screen writer, down on his luck.  The writer wanders onto what appears to be deserted property, and hides his car trying to escape a Finance Co. The  threesome make the creepiest trio you could ever imagine.   In one early scene they have a funeral, casket and all, for a monkey.  Yuk.   <br /> <br />Gloria Swanson was directed to play a woman who still thinks she can make a come back by writing her own script, though she despises movies that \\"talk\\".   She waves her hands about, and makes strange corny expressions with her face in every scene. She falls for the screen writer, William Holden, and won't let him out of her sight.  The film was made in 1950, and Swanson is supposed to be playing a woman of only 50, not exacty over the hill (if we look at many of today's movie stars.)   But she's treated in the film as though she much, much older.  I thought she was supposed to be about 75 or so, but her age is mentioned towards the end of the film.  My heavens, at 50 she could still be in movies, and from the amount of money she apparently had, didn't need to be living in such a dark, creepy house.  Film didn't make sense.    <br /> <br />Sorry I bought it.  It was ridiculous.

0451197879|4.0|Written under his alter-ego of Richard Bachman, ROADWORK was King's first attempt at writing a typical mainstream novel (without the supernatural).  The book takes place in the early -1970s and chronicles the last days of Barton George Dawes.  Dawes is an Average Joe.  He started working at a local laundry company right out of high school and has been there for over twenty years.  He has a beautiful wife and a nice home in the town he grew up in.  He has a lot of friends who care for him--people he grew up with, went to school with, have worked with, and went to church with.  They're a close-knit community.<br /><br />On the surface everything seems fine.  But under the surface, there's a storm brewing.  It started three years earlier when Barton's only son, Charlie, died because of a brain tumor.  That shook up Dawes bad.  A couple years later even more bad news came:  a new highway extension is coming through town right where Dawes has lived his life.  His house is set to be demolished as is the laundry business where he works.  His home; everything he has spent his entire life working for and building is scheduled to come crashing down by a wrecking ball.  Barton George Dawes has set on the sidelines long enough and isn't going to take it.  Some people think he's gone crazy and maybe he has. Whatever the case, Dawes doesn't intend to give up his home without a fight and without trying to get even.<br /><br />King has said that ROADWORK was a novel that he wrote as a way to deal with the death of his mother who died just as King was beginning to receive financial success as a writer.  The story is a bit crude (in writing, not language) and begins rather slow (except for the introduction).  Nevertheless, the book has a lot of emotional appeal and does a decent job of illustrating some of the pressures faced and forced upon an adult living in our post-modern consumer society.  Also, the catalyst for Dawes last stand is the destruction of his home because of eminent domain.  Eminent domain was an issue that was big in the 1970s, but faded away for awhile.  However, eminent domain is becoming a huge issue again as communities, supported by a Supreme Court decision in 2005, attempt to rip people's homes and small businesses away to make way for parking lots, super-sized businesses and corporations, and aesthetic purposes.<br /><br />Overall, even though ROADWORK is a much different work than fans of King might be used to reading, it is a very personal and emotional, yet relatable novel that is well worth reading.ent domain.

0553582461|5.0|There is something intensely personal in the reading of a book.  Your mind shapes the characters, views their reactions, and reacts to their tribulations.  It is quite different from seeing a movie, because there is always this filter there, between you and the story.  Yet when you are reading you can feel the characters' pain and joy, until you make it your own.  The Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies are just such books.  The reader feels familiar with these characters, and soon realizes that you want to go back, see them again.  They start to feel like old friends.
B00003CXCW|5.0|What a fabulous gem of a movie and worthy of a spot in every movie collectors library!! \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" was nominated for several Academy Awards in 1951 including Best Picture. Unfortunately \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" lost the Best Picture nomination to \\"All About Eve\\"! Both movies were great, but I definitely felt after seeing both movies that \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture instead!    \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" draws you in from the very start of the movie. \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" really starts with the end of the movie if you will, because the lead character & movie narrator, Joe Gillis (played by William Holden), is found dead floating face down in a swimming pool.    Gillis is a down and out screenwriter having a difficult time making ends meet. His car is about to be repossessed, so Gillis attempts to ditch his car by pulling it into a driveway leading to what appears to be a run down and abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard. He hides his car in the garage. Gillis soon discovers the mansion isn't abandoned, but occupied by now forgotten silent screen actress Norma Desmond (played by Gloria Swanson) and her butler.     Norma Desmond is an eccentric, reclusive, self-absorbed and delusional woman. She allows Gillis to live with her rent-free & for an indefinite length of time--- The only string attached is that she wants Gillis to write a screenplay based on an idea she has about a movie. She wants to return to acting & sees Gillis as her way back into the movie industry. Gillis hates the idea Desmond has for the movie, but goes along with it anyway.    Gillis and Desmond have a very odd relationship. He becomes totally dependent on her financially and she is very possessive of his time and whereabouts. So he ends up spending much of his time with her either writing the screenplay or sitting around watching all of Desmond's old silent movies on large movie screen with her in her home! Gillis becomes resentful about being tied down to Desmond. So Gillis begins sneaking off to write his own screenplay with another woman with whom he is attracted to instead.    All in all, this movie is enjoyable. This movie is very witty and has a lot of fabulous dialogue between the characters! The acting is exceptionally fantastic. I love the set design and the costuming is splendid as well. A must see film!
B0001UZZWW|5.0|This 2-DVD set includes both SHREK and a 16-minute short entitled SHREK 3-D.  SHREK has been written about enough before, so there's really no point in saying more here.  Besides, just about everyone who will be buying this item will be buying it for SHREK 3-D anyway.  SHREK 3-D is a short animated segment that takes place right after SHREK.  It bridges part of the gap between SHREK and SHREK 2.  Shrek and Fiona are preparing to leave on their honeymoon, but before they can get very far Fiona is kidnapped.  Shrek and Donkey race off to rescue her and are led into a creepy cemetery where they find the \\"gravestone\\" of Lord Farquad.  Turns out Farquad is just a big of conniver as a dead ghost as he was alive.  He's led Shrek and Donkey there to meet their doom while he also kills Fiona by throwing her over a waterfall so that she will be his queen in the underworld.  The short doesn't add much to the Shrek series (though it does show how Farquad is eliminated for good), but it is entertaining.<br /><br />SHREK 3-D comes with a set of 3-D glasses, but the short can be watched as a normal cartoon as well.  The short is actually a ride at Universal studios, but even before that the events of this little cartoon where distributed on a promo cd a year and a half before SHREK 2 was released.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good deal for one's money.  You get the original SHREK as well as the bonus DVD of SHREK 3-D.  Now, go make some waffles.
B000002UAX|3.0|Don't any of you get it? Or maybe those of you who are old enough to remember have just forgotten. The Beatles were growing musically beyond bubblegum rock,and had formed their own company (lets call it Apple). They wanted to push the envelope, see where the could go. But they had a contract with Capitol Records for 40 more tracks. So, they go into the studio, throw together all the crap they had rehearsed and rejected over the past year or so, but it doesn't add up to 40. They cobble together some riffs, make up some lyrics, knock out a few mindless tunes, and their contract with Capitol is satisfied. They refuse to pose for any photos for cover art, so Capitol released the album with a blank (white) cover (the first million copies had a serial number stamped in black ink in the lower right corner), and the Beatlephiles went nuts. This was Breaking New Ground; this was their (best) (most obscure) (prettiest) (George's best guitar work) (Paul returning to his roots) (John feeling whatever John was feeling) blah, blah, blah. There is some good music on this album, but not much. Very little, really. Even Magical Mystery Tour is better, and it was their worst effort. No, it isn't better, really. They are tied for last place. Don't try to analyze the White Album, you'll only look silly. Enjoy those cuts you like, and ignore the rest.

B000000W5L|3.0|I bought this cd back in 1993 at the age of 16. I was already a huge fan of \\"Let It Bleed\\" , \\"Beggars Banquet\\" and \\"Sticky Fingers\\". I bought this cd because i belived the hype, plus i love double albums. This is the one time where i think this doudle album should have been shortened into a very good single albumn. Even now 13 years later, I listen to this cd and I feel the same way I did in 1993. Sometimes you listen to an album and it just dosen't click, then you listen to it years later and it clicks. That is not the case with \\"EXILE ON MAIN STREET\\". This album is just too long. The Beatles \\"WHITE ALBUM\\" is a long album as well, but it just works. \\"EXILE ON MAIN STREET\\" sounds like The Stones were trying too hard to make an album that sounded like \\"THE WHITE ALBUM\\", a little erratic with some backround noise on some songs, some songs very polished, some songs sounding a little un-finished. Just my take....you can disagree if you want. <br />
B000001E2W|2.0|Being a HUGE Anthrax fan, I decided to buy this 1994 live album from Anthrax. As many already know, Joey Belladonna was fired and replaced in 1992, so already you can tell this album's release was decided on by their old record company. It even has the name of the record company in the title!: Island. So how is the album? <br /> <br />Pretty bad. It was recorded at the end of a long 2 year tour supporting the album Persistence Of Time. Because of this, the performances are tired and sometimes sloppy. Though the thing that hurts the album most is the terrible mixing job. The sound quality is muffled and very muddy. Joey Belladonna's vocals, and Charlie Benante's drums are mixed up front, along with Scott Ian and Frank Bello's backing vocals. Everything else goes to the wayside. The guitars and bass are barely audible.  <br /> <br />Some of the tracks are even split in the wrong places! The last four tracks were performed for a radio show. The sound quality is excellent, but they're played almost exactly the same as the studio versions. Why bother? I cannot recommend this CD to anyone but an Anthrax die-hard. The only song that you might want to buy the album for is a blistering performance of \\"N.F.L. (Efilnikufesin)\\".

B00005JP5J|4.0|This was a great way to bring a little sunshine to the last day of my vacation in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The day that I, and one of my best friends, saw this film started like most of the other days of my visit to the Bay Area - foggy, hazy and a bit of a chill in the air.  Further clouding the day's potential was a long and emotionally draining conversation with my friend about the breakup of an unrequited love affair and the suicide of her favorite uncle due to heartbreak from a lost romance.  Needless to say, as we watched the first fifteen minutes of \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" I felt our ability to sit through the entire film getting more tenuous by the second.  Neither of us \\"read up\\" on the film but selected it based on the suggestion of friends to \\"go see it; it's really good and funny\\".  I felt for sure that my friend would bolt from the theatre in tears given the uncanny clash of life and art that befell her as \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" played out on the giant screen before us.  But then we meet Olive, exceptionally portrayed by Abigail Breslin, and get a peep at the sunshine and joy that the character embodies.<br /><br />The center of this fully dysfunctional family of parents, older brother, uncle and grandpa, Olive  wins entry (by default) into a regional kiddy beauty pageant which sets the stage for a family road trip that shows just what this family is made of and how much of it is needed to keep them together.  This film is as emotionally accessible as it is humorous and edifying.  By the end of the film we'd both cried when a particularly relevant scene elicited tears of recognition and we'd laughed riotously when a scene helped us remember that even in the midst of life's chaos, there are always rays of pure joy and outright fun.  This was a great way to lighten up the afternoon and our spirits.  Highly Recommended.
B000FUF6QS|1.0|I wish I could give this movie negative 5 stars. I've seen some bad movies, but this was the worst ever. No redeeming quality whatsoever, even for a supposed \\"cult\\" horror film. Too much singing and crappy music. The only good thing about this movie is the nudity and sex. Very thin plot. The ending was too predictable, I guessed it around the first half of the movie. I don't think the remake will be any good either, but it couldn't be worse. If you really have to watch this movie, turn the sound off, the subtitles on, and play some good music while it is playing. I recommend some Pink Floyd, or other such type of band.  Just another example of why the seventies sucked.
B00005JP5J|5.0|Wow! I just loved this film. It's got the quirky and brutal honesty common in Indy films, but manages also to be downright hilarious!<br /><br />The movie centers around an extremely dysfunctional family who jumps in a van and travels across the country so that Olive, the youngest child, can compete in the \\"Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.\\" I will not spoil anything by giving away details, but the antics that occur along the way are priceless.<br /><br />The best part however, is the ending scene where Olive will absolutely win your heart and make you scream with laughter! I laughed so hard I cried. The entire theatre was in an uproar. In fact, for hours afterwards I would think of scenes and begin to laugh again. It's just the most endearing piece of comedy I've seen in years.<br /><br />I must confess that I am rather hard to please in the comedy department. Films like \\"Anchor Man\\" and \\"Wedding Crashers,\\" while they may have two or three good laughs in them, usually leave me disappointed. \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is consistently fantastic. The entire cast is incredible and I highly recommend the film. It is the best I have seen all year.

B000001FS3|5.0|I often find with the greatest bands that they have a string of around 4 amazing albums of them doing what they do best. Rubber Soul - Abbey Road, Beggars Banquet - Exile, for example. U2 is one of my favorite bands but I'll reckon that they have 2 albums of them being at the very top of their game - therefore you should buy and immerse yourself in them if you haven't already done so. The Joshua tree is one of those albums. Achtung, Baby is the other.<br /><br />And there are many differences between the two. Edge once said that Bono is more of a poet than a songwriter. This albums is an excellent example of that. In Achtung, Baby almost every song is distinguishable and 'whole' - not to mention dark and brooding but with a glimmer of hope. The Joshua Tree is different.<br /><br />Most of the songs are vague in terms of lyrics - but they are epic and anthemic. They're written to you personally and for everyone - they're rarely specifically about something. Which is, of course, why U2 is such a massively popular band. Deservedly so. They're more a poet's musings (or serious thoughts, I don't want to downplay them) than a rock artists' songs.<br /><br />This formula is a dangerous one, and it's probably ruined more than a few artists careers. But U2 pulls it off brilliantly. When it works it really, really works. Most of this album is soaring, beautiful, possibly tear-inducing anthems to... Idk, what it means to be human (I never said Bono lacked ambition)? But it doesn't all the time. I never liked Exit or Bullet the Blue Sky - others swear by them.<br /><br />In short, if you want to infuse some thoughtful, emotional, musical beauty into your day than buy this album. If you wanna hear some thrashing metal than stay away. This album is for most people - but only if you're in the U2, I wanna be uplifted, yearning, thoughtful, and hopeful kind of mood. Buy it and see what all the hype is about, if you seriously gave it a chance and you don't like it than you have no soul, simple as that. Sorry, bro.ul, simple as that. Sorry, bro.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|ANSWER: Horrible!!!!! Complete waste of time and money!!!!! O.K. there are a few good special effects, REMEMBER a FEW, movies just can't rely on special effects alone. I did'nt even want to give this movie 1 star , but I had to due to the rating system.
0062515675|4.0|My initial reaction to this book was that the story seemed a bit weak.  Like a previous reviewer, I also expected a story as fulfilling as Paulo Coelho's \\"The Alchemist\\" and was disappointed to find that the story is only used as a method to present the monk's advice, however, I decided to give the book a chance...and I'm glad I did.     The ideas and suggestions presented in the book can be life-changing if taken seriously.  It gave me ideas on things to improve in my life.  I recommend reading this book at least once and if one of the ideas presented makes a difference in your life, it will be well worth the investment.
B0000027RL|5.0|By the record:<br />Ten has sold at least 2 million more than Nevermind in the US alone<br />Sure, if it wasnt for Nevermind no one would have never caught onto Pearl Jam; but then again they would not have realized how much better it sounded.<br />Nevermind may have debuted at #1 on the charts and 'killed glam metal' but Ten later stole Nevermind's chart position and as stated earlier sold 12 million in the US alone, compared to Nevermind's measly 10 million.<br />If you are anti-American, Ten has still sold 15 million compared to Nevermind's 14 million, just to show you that everybody else hates us.<br />Nevermind may have had great radioplay back in the day, but the only songs you will hear from that album today are \\"Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Come as You Are\\", while Ten has at least 5 of it's tracks that get radioplay everyday.<br />Even Rolling Stones says Ten is better than Nevermind!<br /><br />Off the record:<br />It is just mtv and vh1 propaganda that every other person actually likes Nevermind, so next time you bash someone for being a trend follower or a \\"mtv freak\\" for listening to Van Halen or Def Leppard; JUST SHUT UP!! No body would have noticed Nirvana even existed if it weren't for some tv station called mtv; and it is almost impossible to go anywhere without someone bashing great rock bands like Ac/Dc, Motley Crue, Ratt, Def Leppard, Van Halen, and Bon Jovi just because their contempararies went 'uberglam' and gave everybody else a bad name!  Does it sound like trend following when 7 out of 10 of your classmates think what you listen to is crap?! WHo is the trend follower now?! If you don't like Nirvana, most people consider you either a)a glam metal freak who is pissed because Nevermind took away the jobs of their heroes, b)someone who doesn't know what real music is, or c)a Pearl Jam fan. Many people think: Those Pearl Jam fans are tod because Nirvana destroyed Pearl Jam when it came to ratings. \\"Nirvana is the 6th greatest hard rock band ever, Pearl Jam is the 21st.\\" THose are spoonfed lies from vh1! The only reason why the media has hyped up Nirvana so much as a band is because Nirvana \\"gives a love a bad name!\\"(had to throw in a Bon Jovi reference just to tick off any ubergrunge freak who thinks the 80's was just a [...]crack of crappy electronica.) Nirvana inspired hatred and raping your sister, it helped pave the way for future hateful music genre, like numetal. By making extremly crappy riffs and lyrics about hating your neighbor, rebelling against all authority, and about being pissed that in the early 80's people finally realized that the original punk music sucked butt, Nirvana created a society of seething loath toward all that was good and loving. This is why Ten by Pearl Jam is so underated when anyone brings up the early 90's and the Seattle movement. Where Kurt Cobain created a society of dumbness, incest, and violence; Eddie Vedder created a society of intelligent literature, songs not about being willing to be raped; but instead about the situations that have forced one to be violated against their will. Pearl Jam was necessary to repair the damage Nirvana had done; for if Pearl Jam had not intervened music would not have returned to it's amazingly beautiful form. Pearl Jam made beautiful music, music not heard since the 70's, and because of their impact bands like Staind, Limp Bizkit and Korn die out only after 5 years of existence, instead of becoming 50 million plus selling band like Nirvana. It's funny how people say that Nirvana saved music, in fact Pearl Jam saved music by stealing all of the real rock fans. If Pearl Jam had come before Nirvana, we may have never even heard of Nevermind, because everyone would realize how crappy it would sound next to Ten.<br /><br />Here are the songs that truly saved rock n' roll:<br /><br />1.Once: Intense song about a kid who goes crazy and starts killing people, I think. It is about a person who loses control in some way. Love the music on here, it is likethe rebirth of real rock.<br />2.Even Flow: THeir most popular song, probably the hardest they have ever gotten, although I must admit some of the tracks on RIot Act were pretty intense. Eddie's vocal's on here wouldn't be matched until \\"World-Wide SUicide\\" was released 15 years later on their self-titled landmark.<br />3.Alive: I swear I did not read that other guys review before I wrote this, I'm just extremly good at reading lyrics and decyphering their meaning. A kid is told by his mother that his dad is dead and then they have sex; I know it's kind of freaky, but hey I have a dirty mind (It could be about Santa Claus for all we know). Another distinct feature here is Stone Goussard's guitar work, it actually sounds like classic hard rock; unlike many of their 'grunge' contempararies who used extremly heavy riffs because they can't do real music!<br />4.Why Go?: I think it is about some guys daughter who got a sexually transmitted disease by a wino: \\"She's been diagnosed by some stupid f---!\\" Pretty sweet guitar solo, again it almost sounds like classic 70's rock, unlike the other Seattle bands who were destroying music with their punk-infested cruddy guitar solos.<br />5.Black: Amazing sound effects, I think it is a synth saying: \\"Tattoed everything\\". Not Eddie's best work, but it is pretty emotional.<br />6.Jeremy: I don't know why everyone finds this song so controversial, they edited the music video (and the only reason why is because it has the f-word!) And so what if the radio version isn't edited, neither was \\"Who are You?\\"! Pearl Jam's language is still kindergarten compared to at least 3/4 of the bands out during the time this song was heard.<br />7.Oceans: A soothing song, a trademark for future Pearl Jam albums. This song begins the melodious part of the album which offsets itself from the first 6 hard rock like songs.<br />8.Porch: Like many others, I think this song is amazingly overated. Sure it has a weird start, but the rest of the song is amazing.<br />9.Garden: Another soothing track with some pretty sweet guitar wailing in the background!! When was the last time you heard any of the 'grunge' bands have wailing guitars? Better yet have you even heard them play more than 3 chords?<br />10.Deep: Very dark ballad by Vedder, it touches Deep in the heart. I always thought he was a very dark songwriter.<br />11.Release: Another trademark introduced here is the last song that is like 7 minutes or more! THis is the first at nearly 10 minutes! It is a very good ballad with Vedder singing:\\"Release me! Release me!\\" I guess he didn't mean for us to listen to the sound effects after the song, which sounds like the beginning of \\"Once\\". My favorite on here.popular song, probably the hardest they have ever gotten, although I must admit some of the tracks on RIot Act were pretty intense. Eddie's vocal's on here wouldn't be matched until \\"World-Wide SUicide\\" was released 15 years later on their self-titled landmark.  3.Alive: I swear I did not read that other guys review before I wrote this, I'm just extremly good at reading lyrics and decyphering their meaning.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies since the day I saw it in the theater.  Shamelessly happy.  Shamelessly optimistic.  Shamelessly beautiful.  Funny, funny, funny.  Not unflawed, but still perfect. <br /> <br />By the way, this movie is rated R, and the MPAA wasn't kidding around.  Apparently (and I know this will shock you), there are some people who will deliberately watch a romantic comedy they know is R-rated, and then get all in a tizzy because of the swearing and sex.  These people must do this because they get initially confused by the R-rating and assume that an R-rating merely means violence, like people getting beheaded or eaten by aliens, and such things would of course not be nearly as upsetting as swear words or the sight of pasty English people without their clothes on. <br /> <br />Oh, there's also a diatribe scene against a hypothetical US President who is like the worst of Clinton and Bush.  Lot's of people see this, get their American pride wounded, and resolve to hate the rest of the movie.  You see, Americans would never put anything in a movie that was disrespectful of the British -- that's why we've never randomly given British accents to the villians, prigs and nitwits in American movies.  I mean, honestly, have you ever seen that happen?  I sure haven't.
087349976X|4.0|I've been working with wire a couple of years, but can always find new ways of working with wire.  They have some traditional wire skills along with new ideas.  I found the instructions easy to follow.  I even reviewed some of the traditional designs made for a beginner and used them in teaching a beginners class.  Worked like a charm.  I highly recommend this book for all levels of wire wire except maybe the most advanced.  Most all designs were new and not published elsewhere.
B000002UAO|5.0|I purchased this album in 1966 and was blown away, but first had to readjust from the Fab's earlier works and learn to appreciate how different Rubber Soul was from Help, yet still analogous. I mean, we all knew it was the Beatles when I've Just Seen A Face (American release) leaped into our ears upon our first listen, but they had transcended their classic sound a year earlier, surpassing anything they or anyone else had come close to perfecting prior to Rubber Soul. I'm still marveled by these lads, who were in their early 20's during the time Rubber Soul was composed and recorded, and their incredible sophistication for only being barely out of their teens. It's always been difficult for me to listen to anything new without comparing it to their standards. I guess that's not a grumble. I was so lucky to be elevated to this level of music appreciation at such an early age that it has forever changed my manner of thinking. This is one heck of a classy album and my fave forever! It just keeps getting better with repeated listenings. If I may borrow John's line - \\"In my life...I love them more!\\"
B000GPIPVU|5.0|I heard a interview with Ray Lamontagne on NPR.  That was the first time I have ever heard of this wonderful singer/musician. <br />I purchased Trouble and Till the Sun turns Black.  Enjoyed them both, but my favorite is the newest - till the sun turns black. <br />It's about time a creative song writer and wonderful musician came to our attention.  The lyrics are like listening to a story and the way Ray plays his guitar and the spanish guitar is terrific. Even the back ground musicians add so much to each track.  Thank you for your innovation, Ray. I'm really enjoying the music.  Hope there is more to come that is just as good.. <br /> <br />
1856867889|4.0|Part One <br /> <br /> <br /> Autism is a tendency to view life in terms of one's own needs and desires. Christopher Boone is the perfect example of someone who is cursed and blessed with Autism. The first thing you notice about Christopher is the he is very smart.  <br /> \\"My memory is like a film.\\"(76) <br /> The second thing you know about him is that he doesn't like it when people touch him or talk to him to show emotion. Which is how Christopher got in trouble in the first chapter. <br />Wellington, Mrs. Shears poodle, was found dead in her front yard, stabbed with a pitchfork. Christopher was at the wrong place at the wrong time and was quickly accused of killing the dog. When the police came they tried to touch Christopher and then he hit the officer. From that point on he made it his personal goal to find out Who Killed Wellington and to write a book about it, this book. It is written very well, like it came straight from Christopher's mind and his logical way of thinking things through. Christopher lives with his dad because his mother had died not very long ago. He wasn't told anything about his mothers' death and he wasn't allowed to go to the funeral.  <br />Christopher was not allowed to ask any questions about his mother or who might have killed Wellington, but that didn't make sense to him. <br />          Page 2 <br />\\"I decided I was going to find out who killed Wellington even though Father told me to stay out of other people's business...And this is because when people tell you what to do it is usually confusing and does not make sense.\\"(28) <br /> I can only imagine how hard it is for Chris to get through everyday life with the weird concepts he has. For example, the fact that seeing 4 red cars in a row makes that day a \\"good day\\", and 4 yellow cars in a row make it a \\"bad day\\".  Chris obviously has a lot of drive to do things that people don't expect from him. He is going to be the only person in his school to attempt an A-level math test, and solve the mystery of who killed Wellington.  <br /> At first I felt bad for Christopher's father. He apparently had just lost his wife to a heart attack and now he is raising an autistic teen-age son by himself. But he is never truly open with Christopher about the loss of his wife or why he wants Chris to leave Wellington's murder alone. <br />           <br />Part Two <br /> <br /> Christopher has started investigating Mrs. Shears neighbors and herself for any information on Wellington's murder. One of the first people he runs into is Mrs. Alexander, who lives across the way from Mrs. Shears. This is when Christopher learns that his mom and Mr. Shears were more then just good friends. They actually had an affair and this is why Father did not like Christopher talking to Mrs. Shears, or mentioning Mr. Shears name. <br /> <br />          Page 3 <br /> \\"But I don't feel sad about it. Because mother is dead. And because Mr. Shears isn't around anymore. So I would be feeling sad about something that isn't real, or doesn't exist. And that would be stupid.\\"(75) <br /> Some times I think Christopher is really sad about things that are happening to him but he uses logic to make him think that he is not. He is sort of depriving himself of feeling emotion because he doesn't know how to respond to it. Then he can use his maths and numbers to feel calm in a bad situation. <br /> Christopher kept working on his investigations though until his father found the rough draft of his book on the counter. Again, his father yelled at him for continuing to investigate Wellington's murder and he took Christopher's book and hid it from him. Curiosity got to Christopher though and he found his book hidden in a box in his father's bedroom along with letters that were addressed to Christopher.  <br /> \\"I looked at the front of the envelope and I saw that there was a postmark and there was a date on the postmark. It was quite difficult to read but it was posted 16 October 1997, which was 18 months after mother had died.\\"(98) <br /> This was wrong. I knew immediately that Christopher's dad must have been lying to him about his mother's death. I don't think he knew how seriously this could affect Chris's emotional well being. When Chris went back to get the rest of the letters, his reality was confirmed. His mother was still alive, in London at 451 Chapter Rd. and he must go visit her. Because when Father found out Chris had the letters, he admitted to killing Wellington and that his mom was still alive, only married to Mr. Shears. And Christopher didn't fell safe anymore with his Father. <br /> <br />          Page 4 <br />Part Three <br />  <br /> So that very next day Christopher packed up and took his fathers bank card and left to get on a train to London to find his mother. This took tons of courage on Chris's part because the train is a large crowded place and lots of strangers make him very anxious. It may seem juvenile to not be able to get on a train all by yourself and not be afraid, but it took tons of strength for Chris to do that; even though he hid in the luggage compartment. <br /> Once he got to London and met his mom I couldn't imagine the pain and relief she felt to see her son again. <br /> \\"I kept thinking something dreadful had happened to you, or that you'd moved away and I'd never find out where you were.\\"(193) <br /> Christopher stayed with his mother until she took him back home to Swindon. He had to face his father and learn that he must trust his dad again, even after all the lies.  <br /> \\"You have to learn to trust me... And I don't care how long it takes... If it's a minute a day and it takes years, I don't care. This is more important then anything else.\\"(218) <br /> And Christopher started to trust again. He knew it would take a long time to get to the same point he was at with his dad before Wellington's murder.  <br />  <br /> <br />         Page 5 <br />I read this book in lots of places, mainly after work or in the car.Basically, whenever I found a spare minute to get a few pages read. My summer gets so busy that I mainly picked this book because it was one of the shorter ones on the list. But I am very glad I read it nonetheless.  <br />I rate this book as an eight. It was written very well. It puts you in the same mind set as Christopher so you could really understand the way he felt in situations. I think the theme of this book was very inspirational. Even though Christopher had his share of emotional and mental set backs, he still beat the odds. <br />\\"...I can do this because I went to London on my own, and because I solved the mystery of Who Killed Wellington? and I found my mother and I was brave and I wrote a book and that means I can do anything.\\"(221)  <br />And that made him feel very :-) <br />
B0006M4SO6|2.0|This is probably the most polarizing recording of Metheny's career even to the extent that similar qualities are viewed positively or negatively depending on the listener.  For my money, this is an almost entirely disappointing collection that feels neither original nor very interesting. I've read the jazz versus progressive jazz/rock comments and come down on the side of the latter which doesn't happen to be my favorite genre or what I want to hear from Metheny. It undermines his talents and his overall discography to add a word-of-mouth label to `avoid this one' <br /> <br />The long songs that dominate The Way Up are not compelling enough to hold interest even after repeated attempts. The first track, \\"Opening\\" is described in one of the many 5-star reviews as a song that \\"...combines everything Metheny has done over the years in one song...\\"  I see that as an inherent problem with this recording - it's as if Metheny tries to throw in his entire post-ECM catalog; diffuse, distort and ratchet up the mix enough to achieve something new.  Yes, Pat Metheny has earned the right to experiment but like it or not, any artist can end up a commodity and the road back, like the way up, can be a haul.    <br />
B000GRU6XS|4.0|Now obviously this isn't going to be Number of the Beast or Powerslave, or even Fear of the Dark... these guys are anchient now.  Its impressive to hear them jamming the way they do ont his album knowing their ages.  That being said, the album is pretty good in true Maiden fashion. The songs are long and epic like Seventh son of a Seventh Son.  The tunes are very catchy and the vocals are as good as they ever were.  As far as Maiden albums go this isn't in the top five or anything, but moslty becuase their old albums are soooo great and classic that they can never be topped.  Especially not when the average age of the band members is something close to 45 (maybe 50).  Thats a fact that has to be taken into consideration when judging this album (much like the new Slayer album).  What I find odd listening to this album is the fact that they are touring for this album with Trivium... a band that sounds nothing like them (although at times you can almost tell where Trivium has been influenced by Maiden and Metallica).  If you want really good new metal to go along with this album or if you plan on seeing this tour, pick up Ascendency by Trivium.
B00004LN16|2.0|Oh boy...It really pains me to write this review and say the things that I'm about to say, but...I have no choice! This, as far as I'm concerned, is without a doubt the weakest AC/DC record ever. I know a lot of diehards are going to want to hang me for being such a heretic, but...I'm sorry, I grew up listening to \\"Back in Black\\", \\"For Those about to rock\\", \\"Highway to Hell\\" and \\"The Razor's Edge\\", so you can imagine how dissapointed I feel when I listen to slow songs like \\"Can't Stop RN'R\\", \\"Come and get it\\" \\"Damned\\"...AND THE DARN RECORD IS CHOCK FULL OF SONGS LIKE THAT!!! God, have mercy...whenever I have problems to sleep, I put this pill on...I can't listen to it, and I'm not joking!!! There are, of course, some great songs: the title track, \\"Safe in NY City\\", \\"Satellite Blues\\", and \\"Give it up\\" are stellar, some of the best songs the band has ever written. Sure, the songwriting is WAY more focused than say...\\"Fly on the Wall\\", but the songs are, for the most part, painfully slow and long, and they lack punch (except for those tracks that I mentioned earlier...)What the record gains in songwriting focus it loses in heavyness, and I think it's a bad tradeoff. So, 4 great, fast, rocking songs out of 12...How bad is that? Well, I'll let you decide, but I know that, at least for me, this record is truly stiff beyond recovery...
B00005JNTX|1.0|This movie was the worst piece of garbage I've ever seen.  I loved Resoviour Dogs, Dusk til Dawn, True Romance so I'm not adverse to violence but this was awful.  Even though it was not a true color film, it was just sickening.  Not for teenagers!!
B000005JA8|5.0|This is th real Sg peppers, exile on main street, led zeppelin 1,2 ,3, pet sounds, and all, every one of them are splendid masterpieces but Trout Mask Replica (with Can \\"Future Days\\") is the most spectacular and outrageous record i'd ever listened. I was 18 (ten years from now) and i was completely overwhelmed, i bought iut instantanoeusly after listening to 2, 3 songs in a Virgin store. After these one, i had a similar sensation with a lot of records but never surpassed this summer of 98 ( i bought Can also in that summer) . Thank you Van Vliet and Co.
B00005JP5J|4.0|There aren't a lot of laughs in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, and most of them involves mishaps to the van.  Like when the door falls off, people in the theater laughed a little bit, perhaps startled by the noise of the door's clang on the parking lot asphalt.  All in all it was a pretty glum affair, but a good one, sort of like the old-time New American Cinema movies of the 1970s like THE LONG GOODBYE or FIVE EASY PIECES.<br /><br />A family group tries to complete a roadtrip of 1000 miles West, mirroring an earlier voyage of discovery and colonial conquest by American empire builders and covered wagon pioneers.  And of ci=urse you can't take a road trip in the movies without learning a lot about yourself.  For an independent film, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE hits practically all the three-act plot points Syd Field and his ilk recommend.  Each of the actors undergoes his or her own trauma, revelation, and recovery.  Most of them were pretty well done, like Greg Kinnear's encounter with Bryan Cranston at the Scottsdale hotel.  It did seem a little coincidental that little Olive would happen to have brought with her a test for color blindness to use as a game.  That was hard to swallow.<br /><br />But what really threw me off was Steve Carell's encounter with the one person in the whole world he didn't want to see, at some kind of roadside 7-11 in the middle of nowhere.  Did the screenwriters ever pause to ask themselves if an audience would believe this?  It is to Carell's credit that he almost makes it work.  And the rival Proust scholar who takes over Frank's title and his boyfriend?  Isn't it the Canadian actor who used to play the gay son on Dynasty--Gordon Thomson?  Maybe I'm getting mixed up and his character wasn't gay, just seemed like it.  If so, it's great that Gordon Thomson has hooked himself onto a hit.  It's been a long time between engagements for the man who once replaced Lane Davies as Mason Capwell on the NBC daytime drama, SANTA BARBARA.<br /><br />It was just little things that prevent me from awarding this film four stars instead of five.  Little things like, the revelation of the nature of Olive's number, which she has been practicing all through the film, at the close of the beauty pageant, is it supposed to signal that Alan Arkin's character has been molesting her during their nights together?  I can't wait for the ten years later sequel, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE 2: MONSTER: THE OLIVE WUORNOS STORY.just little things that prevent me from awarding this film four stars instead of five.

B00005JP87|3.0|Edward Norton was really quite something as the illusionist in Vienna at the turn of the century (200 years ago).  Along the vein of today's David Copperfield, he was master at making things and people appear and disappear.  He looked the part of Eisenheim and had attracted a devoted following as he developed seemingly supernatural powers.  He'd acquired an eloquent old theatre in which to entertain his fans and, by the way, he looked the part in every way -- at first.<br /><br />It was all a trick, an illusion, as he delved into the dark arts whereby fate could just be chance.  Jessica Biel made a good Hungarian princess, a bit dumb.  After his childhood love re-enters his life, he seems to fall apart.  She's been claimed by the crown prince of Austria who is planning to overthrow his father.  Telling everything was out of this question at this point, but Sophie knew his secret.  She had dreamed about E. for fifteen years and hoped to see him again (now, you have, he'd said).  \\"Why should you care what happens to me now -- why?\\"  His sincere reply: \\"my heart couldn't let go of you.\\"  He was sure that he had charmed her again.<br /><br />Then, we are led on a road of treachery, murder, abuse, coverup -- or is it all an illusion.  You must see the ending and figure it out for yourself.  He was believeable as he expanded his repertorie to manifestations and spiritualism in his attempts to contact the dead with the use of mirrors.  He was surrounded by fools; I think I am going to enjoy this.  He loses his looks of professionalism and appeared to disappear, or did he?  As an ordinary passenger on the night train, he looked very ordinary, not dapper at all in his disguise.  The crown prince could not face the music and was trapped because of his mean temperament.  He got what he asked for.  Who was betrayed?  What does it mean to die?  It's not that easy; he couldn't let her go -- neither of them could or would.  My apologies, of course,  You never did understand what exactly had happened.  I couldn't figure out why.  How did he manifest those blue butterflies, what was their significance.  The costumes and the expert acting made this movie a classic.  You've got to see it to believe it.ened.  I couldn't figure out why.

B000002U82|5.0|This is a brilliant work of art.  It is a concept album from the days that an album was not a collection of songs.  It speaks of the post-modern world and finds it an empty and dark space.  It shows those elements of pathos, \\"Time\\", \\"Money\\", pressure (\\"On the Run\\"), dichotomy(\\"Us and Them\\"), and how they eventually lead to \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse\\".  In the end there is the beating of the human heart with Waters saying \\"There is no Dark Side of the Moon, as a matter of fact it's all dark\\".  As melancholy as this all sounds, the album is great fun to listen to.  It is one of those rare recordings that sounds far better on the original vinyl.  The second song, \\"On the Run\\", has, I would guess, about half the sound on CD when the plane lifts off as the vinyl.  Perhaps this is because the Pink Floyd pressings were always so good or because an 80 bit sampling cannot capture such a rich sound.  Buy it for the beauty and expression of the human condition.  Listen to it on Original Master Recording if you get the chance.  Rates with King Crimson's \\"Court of the Crimson King\\" as best concept albums.
B000H7JD4K|4.0|First off, if you are looking for another 'Number of the Beast' or 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son', you may consider either losing that expectation or - if you cannot - stop listening to Maiden altogether because they are not going to repeat what they did in the past (I have learned that the hard way with Metallica and have moved on). <br /> <br />That said, this is one helluvan album!  This is the most I've enjoyed since 'Fear of the Dark'.  The guitars are higher in the mix than in the past, the solos and breaks are interesting, the drumming and bass are the best in many albums, and the melodies keep you engaged.  I was pleased to hear some of the majestic arrangements back in their songs.  Although Bruce sometimes sounds like he is straining (which happens more as he gets older), his best performance in years has been captured on this album.  Don't let the 'we didn't master this album' factor scare you off.  This is a great sounding album!  Are there weak songs/spots on the album?  Absolutely.  I won't share them because what I dislike someone else might love.  However, these spots don't diminish the rest of the album (that's what the skip buttons on a cd player are for).  It is unrealistic to think that I would like every song or moment on the album.   <br /> <br />While this is not my favorite Maiden album, I can safely say that this is their best since Bruce came back into the fold.  I liked the previous two albums plenty, but this one is hands-down better.  If you didn't like the other two at all, you probably won't like this one.  Maybe you can stream a few songs or something to give yourself an idea if this album is for you before spending your money.  As for me, I will be listening to this for many years to come.
B00004RHZU|2.0|I really dragged me feet on getting this disc because I have a real pet peeve about music artists who debut singing a particular genre of music then switch up on their sophomore releases saying \\"THIS IS THE REAL ME - THE LABEL MADE ME SING THAT OTHER STUFF\\". I was disgusted by Pink's switcheroo but remained curious enough about her debut cd that I finally decided to buy it.<br /><br />After a few listens, I am decidedly underwhelmed by the disc mainly because Pink's voice is unrecognizable on most tracks and also to me there are no real stand out tracks.  The only tracks I enjoyed listening to are:<br /><br />HELL WIT YA - love her quick almost talking vocals a la Beyonce<br /><br />MOST GIRLS - although the lyrics are monotonous, Pink sounds fantastic along with the interesting beats<br /><br />LET ME LET YOU KNOW - beautiful ballad<br /><br />LOVE IS SUCH A CRAZY THING - honestly, the music production & background harmonies are more interesting than Pink's solo vocals<br /><br />STOP FALLING - very pretty ballad that showcases her voice<br /><br />I really wouldn't recommend this disc because it's pretty generic \\"hip pop\\" with no truly standout songs unless you're really curious about Pink's debut to the music world (and can get the disc real cheap).
0743201140|5.0|Proactive people who want to make positive changes in their lives will like this book.  By focusing on a person's individual talents--and emphasizing the uniqueness of that combination of talents--the authors have given readers a forward-looking, personal development tool.    Coaches love this book because it gives them a cheap and easy diagnostic tool to use with their clients.  Many coaches (including me) combine the StrengthFinders data with other objective feedback from other diagnostic sources when working with clients.  However, clients seem to respond to the StrengthFinders feedback in particular, perhaps because it is so positive.  It really celebrates the best in a person.    I have observed how much clients (lawyers) enjoy looking at their individual feedback and applying that information to their current careers.  Many have enhanced their current law practices by emphasizing their natural strengths; for example, lawyers who score high in \\"Winning Over Others\\" or \\"WOO\\" ensure that their client development/rainmaking efforts include lots of person to person contact (as opposed to indirect client development by writing articles etc...)      The StrengthFinders data can validate someone's natural talents--talents which the person might have sensed but never articulated.  I've seen unhappy lawyers who were thrilled to get their StrengthFinders feedback because it confirmed what they had always sensed:  their natural strengths were different than those required by their particular jobs.  In some cases, this has helped lawyers to tweak their jobs to make them more satisfying--and in others, to leave law practice entirely.    Other previous reviews have described the book's weaknesses.  It is clearly not perfect as a management tool.  However, as a tool for quick, easy and inexpensive feedback-which feedback appears to be accurate-it's quite worth the price.

B000BQ7BX2|5.0|This is a very unusual set of Mahler symphonies. I became curious about this set from reading correspondences between different Mahler fans in various chatrooms. What made me curious was the strongly opposing views that people had of this set. Due to its scarcity prior to the recent box set release, it sort of became an unknown legend. Many claimed that it was the best they have ever heard and others thought it was overated. Being a Mahler fan, it got me really itching to hear what all the fuss was about.Then I read a rave review by David Hurwitz in ClassicsToday and decided to take a plunge.  I finally got to hear it for myself. <br /> <br />What I heard really took me by suprise. Although the music was familiar to me, I felt that I was hearing completely new pieces. The best way to describe it was that it was more \\"classical\\" than other Mahler interpretations. I guessed the Japanese critic who wrote the introduction for Mr. Bertini was probably right but in a clumsy fashion. I had to say my initial response after reading the notes was not to buy the box set. I was glad that I did not base my assessment on his notes.  <br /> <br />There was certainly a smoothness in the music and people who were used to having their dramatic interpretations may protest against this music. However, I did not think that necessarily had to be the case. The Japanese critic seemed to suggest that if you liked Bernstein, you would not like Bertini. I disagreed. I am a fan of Bernstein's Mahler intrepretations and although I agreed that the two conductors' interpretations were diametrically opposed to each other, both interpretations are valid. Maybe this is becasue I did not have a fixed expectation of how Mahler should be played. I just simply wanted to enjoy the music. I started liking Mahler not because of I realised he was a great symphonist. I liked Mahler simply because I liked what I heard. I thought that listening to both different sets bring out the genius of Mahler. The two different interpretations (Berstein and Bertini) complimented each other rather than competed. I did not think there was a perfect or right interpretation of Mahler. I thought having different interpretations of Mahler enriched the appreciation and enjoyment of Mahler. That was why I would suggest that this Bertini set is a must have as it was very different to all the other Mahler interpretaions available. The others varied in the emphasis and drama of the music but this interpretation took on a totally new approach. Bertini took a historical approach of going back to music before Mahler whilst others took on a futuristic approach of taking music to times after Mahler. As a result,I was hearing so much more in Mahler's music and I was so thankful to Mr. Bertini for his revelation of Mahler.

B000002LFU|5.0|'Green' has all of R.E.M's energy and virtuoso musicianship.  It is a propelling and pleasing encyclopedia of pop music.  The positive spirit pervades, much like 'Life's Rich Pageant,' but the richness of sound continues with the able hand of Scott Litt, who became, with of late Pat McCarthy, one of two anchor producers.  The lyrics, which improved on '...Pageant' and later more consistently on 'Document' is even better this time overall.      The first half is rightly heralded as nearly flawless.  \\"Pop Song '89,\\" \\"Get Up,\\" and \\"World Leader Pretend\\" are propulsive and lyrically skillful.  \\"You Are the Everything\\" is folk-rock perfect, much like \\"Fall on Me\\" before it.  Here they started a string of beautiful ballads.  Then, there is novelty.  But, what novelty!  \\"Pop Song '89\\" is funny, but their hit song \\"Stand\\" is gourmet bubble gum.  Sounding like an updated version of an old \\"Twister\\" commercial, they entertain without losing their expertise.  Side Two is usually criticised, but it also a gem.  \\"Orange Crush\\" follows the perfect power pop with an anthem and one of the C.D.'s very best songs.  \\"Hairshirt\\" is ably written with some fine mandolin accompaniment by Peter Buck.  The reference to \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" only accentuates the loneliness of the one addressed, but they still retain their originality.  \\"I Remember California\\" is edgy; \\"Turn You, Inside-Out\\" is their biggest slab of hard rock; and their finale, originally named, \\"...\\" is a beautiful Beach Boys' coda, full of warmth and harmony.    Many will find fault with portions of 'Green,' but it remains a progressive and heartfelt cornerstone for R.E.M.'s portfolio of excellent albums.

B000ETRCMQ|5.0|So what's the story?<br /><br />Pre-op male to female transsexual Bree (Felicity Huffman) discovers she has a teenage son, Toby (Kevin Zegers). Unsurprisingly, some might say, Toby has gone off the rails slightly and has been arrested for prostitution - or hustling, to give it its proper street terminology. It's awful timing and Bree's therapist will not sign her off for the final stage of her transformation until she deals with the emotions of being a father. Bree has to go down and, pretending to be a church missionary type, bail Toby out and try to get him home. Thus begins a road trip across America with a difference.<br /><br />An issue-led drama then.<br /><br />Well, not exactly. By getting a woman to play a man wanting to become a woman, I think Hollywood compromised in order to make the movie more palatable to the mainstream. It would've been much easier, more courageous and closer to the truth of the story, to get a man to play the role. This was a golden opportunity to grasp the sensitive and overlooked issue of gender dysphoria or transsexualism and give it the prominence it deserves. I'm not sure that was achieved here.<br /><br />Would any major Hollywood star have signed up for it?<br /><br />Good point. Hollywood does have a history of guys dressing up was gals for laughs - Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in \\"Some Like It Hot\\", Dustin Hoffman in \\"Tootsie\\" and Robin Williams in \\"Mrs Doubtfire\\" are a few examples, but being a male to female transgender person is not the same as being a transvestite, drag queen or fetishistic cross dresser. Hence, while it may have been easy to get stars like Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguziamo to drag up in \\"Too Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar\\", getting a male movie star to play this role could have potentially presented a significant challenge but I think it would've been a challenge worth facing.<br /><br />So a disappointment then?<br /><br />Quite the opposite. Felicity Huffman is a tour de force in the role. She is funny, engaging and, with the aid of clever prosthetics, totally convincing - a million miles away from Lynette, the sleek, sophisticated professional she plays on \\"Desperate Housewives\\". She obviously did her research and seems to have a very clear grasp of the emotional gravitas of what it means to be born into one gender, while believing and desperately wishing and wanting to be another. I hadn't actually seen either this nor \\"Walk The Line\\" when Reese Witherspoon won best actress Oscar for the latter film earlier this year. But I'd seen the trailers, and she did learn to sing for goodness sake, so I thought it was an Oscar well deserved. Now, having seen both movies, I'm not so sure. Actually, the more I think about it, the more I think Huffman may have been robbed. At its heart, this movie is all about two people rediscovering themselves, while discovering each other. The story of the father and son getting to know each other (despite emotional obstacles that both of them are grappling with) is very touching and there is humour and pathos here in equal measure. I personally laughed my head off almost all the way through. The relationship starts off hostile, moves on to awkward but by the end of the movie, you really get the sense that these are two individuals who may actually go the distance. How will Toby react when he finds out that this silly looking woman is actually the father he's hit the road to find? How will Middle America react to Bree as they cruise through small towns, motels and truck stops on the road from east to west? Will anyone actually suss that Bree's a man? All these questions make it an exciting movie to watch and I think it's a triumph, not just for Huffman herself but also for newcomer Duncan Tucker who both wrote and directed the movie, as well as William H Macy (Huffman's husband), who produced it. They should all be very proud.<br /><br />And before I forget: a special nod to Elizabeth Pena who plays Bree's therapist. That woman is good in anything she does.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Five-star movie. It looks fairly good. There are a few dust/dirt spots on some of the image, particularly some of Peter Cushing's scenes aboard the Death Star, but nothing too distracting. The sound is solid, probably what it sounded like in 1977 (good stereo, but no surround-sound available.) Also, the opening \\"crawl\\" only says \\"Star Wars.\\" No \\"Star Wars - Episode IV: A  New Hope.\\" That finally puts an end to the argument that the original 1977 prints contained \\"A New Hope.\\" (They did NOT, otherwise all of the toys, lunchboxes, figures and comic books from 1978-1979 would have included \\"A New Hope\\" in their titles.) There are a couple tie-fighter scenes where the transparent \\"border boxes\\" are seen around the model ships,  but only in a handful of scenes. Most of the ships and space battles look really good. Again, these 1977 flaws are not distracting. There is a minor \\"click\\" sound as the DVD disc layer switches, immediately after Cushing says \\"Terminate her. Immediately.\\" Thankfully, the film looks the way it originally did. (Yes, the not-so-great airbrushing job seen below Luke's \\"floating\\" landspeeder, but you don't get the silly explosion rings seen in the 2004 edition when planets explode.) <br />One of the best films ever. Overall, the image is clear and lively, although a few visual flaws exist here and there. Again, the blemishes aren't too distracting, although I don't have a digital TV. I do have a very large RCA TV, and the image is pretty impressive. They could have added more bonuses on the disc though, instead of just the trailer for the Star Wars Lego videogame. Screen tests, anyone? The retro artwork on the back of the DVD case and the inside insert (which should have more information and photos) is pretty cool, reminiscent of the 1977 and 1978 theatrical posters that decorated movie lobbies. Get it if you must own the original theatrical version -- this is the one I've been waiting for, where Tatooine looks desolate and alien, not the overrpopulated scenes in the \\"Special Edition\\" where Mos Eisley looks like Dallas, Texas, in rush-hour traffic.  But if you're happy with George Lucas' recent \\"Special Edition\\" releases, it's probably not worth $20 to those who like Lucas' recent \\"changes.\\" Oh, and yes, Han Solo shoots first in this orignial theatrical DVD. Although expected and anticipated by the viewer, when the blast shoots straight at the camera and the smoke rises, it's almost a shock, probably because we're almost used to the almost-10-year-old \\"Greedo Shoots First\\" scene in Lucas' \\"Special Edition.\\" Let's hope the original theatrical \\"Empire\\" DVD has the original emperor and \\"Return of the Jedi\\" has actor Sebastian Shaw (not Hayden Christensen) in the final jedi \\"ghost\\" scene. <br />Cheers!
B000HCO840|4.0|You have to watch the movie as a story of it's own, I love comic books but, separated it from the stories I have read and the changes I feel worked!  I was chewing my finger nails because I knew someone was going to die but didn't know who.  I think all 3 stories worked well there was a progression from learning to deal with their abilities to defending humans.  I wouldn't mind see a spin off showing where Wolverine and Storm or even Rogue came from (but don't use Halle, she did ok but I think a younger actress with a little accent would be better). They have quite dramatic past if done according to the comics.  I hope they do not make any more as I think it should be left alone so spin offs could be made relating to it, I think that would be better.  <br /> <br />Can someone tell me it there are special features on the Stan Lee Collector Edition?  <br /> <br />And when is X-men Evolution season 4 coming out!
B00005JOYM|3.0|This film is not entirely horrible, and it's one that we should all see at least once I'm sure, but the controversy regarding this film I think transcends a little deeper than whether or not our country was ready to face the events of 9/11 so boldly.  I feel that we were ready, but I'm afraid to say that this film just doesn't quite bring us there.  It delivers on a few levels but fails to really serve to the viewer the true feelings and emotions of that fateful day, mostly because the attacks are never seen and the devastating true story revolving to policemen John (Cage) and William (Pena) is so watered down that it loses every ounce of feeling while either of them is on screen.  That's not to sound harsh, and as I'm writing this I'm wondering how many pissed off Americans are going to rush to hit the `not helpful' button, but I have to be honest.  I felt absolutely nothing for either actor because to me they brought absolutely nothing to their character.  Michael Pena did do one up on Cage by revealing some depth in emotion on a few pre and post accident scenes, one when he first hears of the attack and is wanting to call his wife and the second when he is in the hospital fighting with his wife over the baby name (his wife Alison, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, is pregnant in the movie).  Cage though was completely dead to me, evoking absolutely no emotion whatsoever, and Maria Bello floored me in her lack of depth for after her brilliant performance in last years `History of Violence' I expected the most from her. <br /> <br />I did find a small glimmer of light though, and that was in the eyes of the extremely talented Gyllenhaal who just illuminates the screen every scene she as in and I'm hoping will finally pull out an Oscar nomination because of this.  If anyone in this film deserves it it's her.  Her tortured performance as a pregnant woman coming to terms with the fact she may indeed be a widow soon with the very fact that she must tell her four year old daughter hanging over her head was the most moving and emotionally gripping aspects of this movie, and quite frankly the only reason I shed a few tears (the whole scene where she's fighting with her husband (playfully) about the baby name is so touching).  The rest of the supporting characters are so underdeveloped and or just plain ignored that they become a waste of space, and in the case of Stephen Dorf and Michael Shannon, a complete waste of talent for even they brought absolutely nothing to the picture, Shannon going as far as to deliver one of the worst performances I've seen all year.  I guess I just expected a lot from this movie, I expected to feel so much different when walking out of it, but instead of feeling a sense of heroism for the two leads or a sense of remorse and or depression for that horrific day I was left wanting and even, dare I say, a bit annoyed that what should have and could have been a great and truly inspired film became nothing more than a movie.  It was okay, but nothing special, and judging by the source material it should have been something VERY special. <br /> <br />I do feel a bit of sympathy for director Oliver Stone because it's obvious the man is a man of vision, he's just losing his footing somewhere in delivery.  This isn't his first falter for 2004's `Alexander' was an equal disappointment.  We all know that Stone can manage a good if not great film, for just look at `Natural Born Killers' or `Nixon'.  In the past Oliver was able to hone his skills and deliver to us a brilliant cinematic experience, but of late he's been so focused on the boring details that he loses the whole purpose of what he's trying to convey, he loses what really makes these stories worth telling, and in effect he loses us, the viewer, and that's a very bad thing.  I was skeptical about seeing this film because the critics were even saying that it was very watered down and unsatisfying, but I stuck to my guns like I always do and was prepared to onceagain disagree with the paid professionals, but in this case I have to suck it up, reign in my pride and eat crow because the critics were right.  It's not horrible, but it's not great, and that's a shame, because it should have been just that...great. <br /> <br />At least we had Gyllenhaal...

B00005JOYM|4.0|Filmed from the personal level----- <br /> <br />*** This comment may contain spoilers *** <br /> <br />I got to the theater to see \\"World Trade Center\\" today and thought it was excellent. <br /> <br />By taking the story to the personal level of just the two Port Authority Policemen trapped in the rubble, it made you root for them and not concentrate on all those others. It was really a struggle to survive and I was sure glad when the two Marines finally found them. <br /> <br />The two Marines made a good, quiet, determined, and steely resolved representation of what we like to think of the American Spirit. Get the job done! No heroics! No seeking the spotlight! Just 2 guys with the grit to go into that chaos and see if they could find anyone alive. Very effective characters and I would like to know if they were based on actual men or were composites. <br /> <br />Since the bulk of the film is the two trapped men talking, and their wives at home trying to cope, it bought the huge tragedy down to a scope that ordinary people can relate to. We see how these two brave men managed to help each other even though they could not move. And how their families helped each other and stood strong. <br /> <br />I teared up when they brought them out, among all the firemen and police along the way. We saw that image so often during the recovery - just very emotional. This is a very good Oliver Stone film
B000EOTAM6|4.0|This move gets my vote as I'm some one of the Liquid TV era I<br /><br />enjoyed see the animated Aeon take a real person roll.<br /><br />The movie leaves room for sequals as was the Idea with origonal animated version.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be more to come.<br /><br />She's hot for being as dressed as she is compared to the origonal animation.<br /><br />The Science Fantacy special affect were new and innovative without being dark in it violence.<br /><br />It would be nice if MTV was still as entertaining as Aeon.
0440214041|4.0|The Pelican Brief is one of John Grisham's more fast paced and exciting book.  <br /> <br />Two supreme court justices are murdered by someone who does such a good job that there are few if any clues to go on. Darby Shaw and her lover/professor are intrigued by who could have done this so Darby does a ton of research and writes the \\"Pelican Brief\\". Her boyfriend/professor is a good friend of someone in the FBI and the file gets distributed. The bad guys find out about Darby, who apparently has hit the suspects right on and the chase begins.  <br /> <br />This book is very entertaining with nonstop action. You'll be constantly turning the page to see how Darby and friends etc keep escaping and how the plot will unfold.  <br /> <br />The only problems with the book are as follows:  <br /> <br />1 - The book has so many characters that it gets confusing at times <br /> <br />2 - The book is all action and adventure and little else. Once it's done you'll never go back and read it again. This would make a very poor book club book. <br /> <br />3 - A little over the top on the implied sex etc between Darby and her professor etc... (but nothing compared to what you'll get in other books) <br /> <br />Overall a very entertaing and exciting book but not a lot of \\"soul\\". I would definitely recomend it to anyone who likes action books.  <br /> <br />
B00008DDSC|2.0|I watched this because my nephew told me it was funny.  I thought it was very sad, actually.
0224076051|5.0|Excellent book. There are hard parts and easier parts. But the main point is that diversity is needed in the study of physics, I agree. Peter shows that string theory has not lived up to its hype, our research dollars can be better spend by providing funding for a portfolio of studies into various areas not only ST. See Penrose for some further ideas here. I vote Peter, Lee and Roger are the board of review for Physics funding based on there excellent approaches. <br />
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I thought this movie was great.  Great acting, great costumes.  Did Mr. Darcy ever smile?
B000E8QVWY|5.0|This is an amazing movie. If you aren't a fan of Johnny Cash, you will be after you watch this movie. The acting, the story, and definitely the music work very well and make this movie incredible. You hear about his life, but it is a different thing when you watch it. Once again, the actors were fantastic and everyone fit their role perfectly. R.Patrick was great as John's dad, he isn't given enough credit, but he did a great job in his role. Overall, great...get this movie!
B000H7JD4K|4.0|An excellente album and the first one Maiden has done since 7th son that sounds innovative and fresh.  However I gave it 4 stars because of some production issues and because they haven't fired Janick Gers.  Though the album sounds raw, and obviously was made to sound that way, it should've sounded better.   It is no way near, sound quality wise,  Somewhere in Time or 7th SOn.  And if we were to pick an earlier album to make comparison, Piece of Mind still sounds better in my view (take the drum sound for instance). This album wasn't mastered and that may have something to do with it.  It was a Steve Harris judgment call.  And a note to the friend who said that Nicko McBrain is playing better than ever:  NO WAY!  Listen to Powerslave or Piece of Mind.  this is not Nicko at his best by any stretch. He does ok but not great. <br /> <br />However the album is their best since probably 7th son and the song are great.  Brighter than a thousand suns is my favorite, It really rocks, but in the future they should change producers and keep Harris out of it.  I don't like what he is bringing to the table as a producer.  Don't like Kevin Shirley or whatever his name is either.  Only a nut producer (or a very mediocre one) would advise a band against the mastering process of a new recording.
1400032717|5.0|I can't speak to how well this represents the thinking of an autistic person, though it would clearly have to be a very high-functioning autistic, I'd think.  However, I absolutely enjoyed reading this book and read the entire thing in one day. <br /> <br />Told from the perspective of a 15-year-old with autism, the book is his account of his attempt to solve a neighborhood crime of which he's been accused.  Utterly logical and guileless, Christopher faces a world of confusing metaphors and social graces.  His attempts to break them down logically will have you questioning your own reactions to everyday things.   <br /> <br />I loved that the chapters were numbered with prime numbers and the way his interests interupt the story (a chapter on a math problem in the middle of big revelations).  Though the main character doesn't like metaphors, the author's use of similes makes the writing vivid and alive, and makes it very easy to see the whole episode from him point of view.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I have to tell you that I agree with much of what is being said here. First of all, we asked for the original versions and that's what we're getting. While the argument that they should be in anamorphic widescreen and in Dolby 5.1 makes sense, it also means we're not getting what we asked for. <br /> <br />For me this is about being able to finally put to bed my laser disc player. I have a 9-disc set of the original trilogy in it's original condition, but my antique laser disc player won't easily interface with my modern TV. Now I can put the player in the attic and be done with it. <br /> <br />As for next year's inevitable re-release of the trilogy in yet another once-in-a-lifetime format, that's a given. It's not just Lucasfilm doing that - half of the movies on the DVD release list are actually re-releases. They send out a second disc with special features and call it a new version. Here's an idea: get the second disc from Netflix. You only watch the second disc once anyway, right?
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I would never have guessed that this film was based on a video game--I certainly couldn't tell from the plot.  Then again I grew up with Pac-Man and Donkey Kong.  I loved this movie!!  I generally like more traditional horror flicks (\\"The Shining\\", \\"Jeepers Creepers\\") and have a tough time with some of the more recent films that jump all over the place with no explanation and nary a hint.  At first I had my doubts...but watching past the first 15 minutes revealed that this is one movie that didn't have to add in a bunch of unnecessary junk to make up for what it didn't have.    \\"Silent Hill\\" was a perfect balance for me, an unusual concept (a coal mining town sitting on top of a slow-burning fire, deserted--or is it?), and logical but not easy-to-guess conclusions to events.  Excellent unexpected effects!  Things done in new ways!  Creepy and wierd!  If you enjoy scaring yourself now and again to remind yourself how lucky we are that we aren't going through something spooky and unexplainable like this, here is a film just right for a night alone when you want to curl up on the couch with your trusty milkduds 'n' a beer and scare yourself silly :o    Close the drapes ahead of time just in case there's something under the couch...and turn out the lights!
0780020685|5.0|So much has been written about SEVEN SAMURAI, I am reluctant to besmirch the record with any no-doubt redundant observations of my own. But I will point out that the film's subtitles had two of the odder translations I've come across, namely \\"sheeyit\\" and \\"mollycoddle.\\"<br /><br />While quite long, SEVEN SAMURAI does not test one's patience because of the humor and engaging personalities the film displays. I was surprised that I couldn't watch the film in widescreen, but that is apparently the way it was shot.<br /><br />No matter. It's still a great movie; anyone who enjoys its realistic, unglamorous portrayal of samurai life is strongly encouraged to watch THE TWILIGHT SAMURAI.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|It takes nothing away from my love for MGM's sumptuous WIZARD OF OZ -- with which I have grown up and still find as watchable as ever the tenth or dozenth or 837th time -- to say that I greatly admire RETURN OF OZ.  This underappreciated film couldn't win for losing when it was released: had it tried to follow the path taken by the inimitable 1939 classic, it would have rightly been judged redundant and inferior; yet it caught flak and brickbats because it dared to go its own way.  More accurately, it went L. Frank Baum's way, being quite faithful to the letter and spirit of the source material.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|This cd just keeps on growing on me each day, I have had it for a week now. There's only one song which I'm not Crazy about that's \\"The Legacy\\", otherwise this cd rocks, great melodies, riffs, etc.  Classic Maiden.<br /><br />If you love Maiden like me since 1979 then you will like it no matter what, if you are just getting into Maiden then I would suggest 7th son, Number of the beast or Powerslave first!<br /><br />Otherwise this a MUST Have!!!<br /><br />10 stars!
B000FIMG68|5.0|The second season of Lost really takes the show to a new level - especially in the second half of the season when everything really starts to come together and some big answers and questions are revealed. <br /> <br />Despite what others might say the second season is much stronger then the first overall.  We are introduced to a whole host of new characters - including some of the best characters in the entire show.  The infamous Henry Gale for example has already become a classic television character, not to mention the likes of Desmond, Mr. Eko, Mr. Friendly and even the often hated Ana Lucia. <br /> <br />This season has a little bit for everyone.  Romance, suspence, action, mystery and MORE MYSTERY.  While the first season was more about character development and survival, this season is where the true mysteries and mythology of Lost begin to reveal themselves. <br /> <br />An instant classic - do yourself a favour and watch the second season today!!!
0783233477|5.0|MEET JOE BLACK has a lot going for it. Brad Pitt for one. Anthony Hopkins for another. Mr. Hopkins, arguably our greatest living actor, puts on an acting clinic in MEET JOE BLACK that should be required viewing by every drama student. Every inflection in his voice, every gesture, every expression is rich with theatrical meaning. He gives a masterful performance. Pitt is no slouch in this either. It is like dueling actors, the old and the young. Throw in two more things. Claire Forlani plays Hopkin's daughter who falls for Pitt (poor girl!). She has a face that is beautifully tragic or tragically beautiful; whether she is smiling or frowning, she seems about to cry. She gives a stunning performance and adds a major dimension as the love interest. The other is that, if you like modern art, you will love the abstract paintings shown prominently in MEET JOE BLACK. The collection of paintings add an unusually strong input from a competing visual medium. Oh, and did I say that the production values are good? A love story involving life and death and how to live life. MEET JOE BLACK is a winner. See it, rent it, own it. They don't make too many like this one. Highly recommended.
0440224764|4.0|Reissued as a paperback in August 2006, The Partner leads the reader on a roller-coaster of emotions in a fast-moving plot.<br /><br />In what I consider John Grisham's best work, there really aren't too many heroes to be found in the manipulative world of the news media, politics, finance and law.<br /><br />The story is pushed along through the retelling of facts through a variety of transcripts. It works, since none of the characters could be \\"trusted\\" to tell the truth to another individual. Simply, documents don't lie, people do.<br /><br />Everyone has a price to sell out a colleague or loved one; but the person seemingly most manipulated turns out the winner in the end.
B000FIMG68|4.0|In the first season of Lost they set things up so you know some weird things were coming.  That is fine but the first season also had a ton of action.  Also there was a lot more to the stories.<br /><br />In season 2 we are going to have to push this button.  Man did I get sick of them having to push that button.  3 or 4 episodes were outstanding but they don't continue with the story near as much as I thought they would.  Like when Locke was able to walk after being in the plane crash.  Then in a crucial scene in season 1 his legs seem to be giving weay.  By the next episode we are just supposed to forget about him being able to use his legs normally again. Then they didn't even touch upon his legs in season 2.  Now that is dissapointment.<br /><br />Overall we still have all the great characters it just went too freaking slow this season!  The addition of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje(Adabeze)from the HBO show OZ was very welcomed by me, and of course like everyone else I am really itching for season 3 to start.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I know that will come into disagreement to those who said that this CD is the weak link in Bob's latter day trilogy, but I feel this is better than the last outing.   To me, more songs are memorable than Theft, I mean, I like that album too, but I thought some songs there was only held together by the Bard's lyrical content, not by the song itself.   Granted Bob has borrowed a couple of Muddy Waters songs to make new ones, but that is not to say Muddy probably did the same thing himself, and I seriously doubt that Zimmy will be hearing from the estate of Muddy Waters any time soon.   The music is more snappy and he is singing with more clarity and distinction.  He has learned to use his voice better now,  or maybe I am getting used to it, I don't know.    If you any reservations on buying this, forget them and buy this, no one puts out CDs like this except Mr. Dylan himself.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Lost Season 2 is quite an experience.  While I definitely believe that season 1 is superior, this season still has so many great episodes, and a ton more unanswered revelations about the island, the survivors, and the others.  The best part of this season is the interactions between Jack and Locke, who are both vying to be the leaders of the group of survivors.  Both have extremely different ideas and motivations, and to see them go at it is very entertaining, especially if you have a specific one you root for...  I think that this season lacks somewhat in the quality flashbacks that spoiled us from season 1.  The writers of the show had so many tricks up their sleeve for flashbacks during the first season, that I think the flashbacks in this season seem a little bit too normal.  But that is a minor complaint in the shadow of the what is the best show on televion.<br /><br />This show is a must-see.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|If society wasn't so shallow, they would cast Mel and Tom by the roadside, where poor actors should be left, and seek out brilliant actors such as Hugo Weaving, star of V for Vendetta. If the script had been a bad one, I think Hugo still would have made it brilliant, but we all got lucky here -- they actually found someone left who can write. Script, acting, story, plot, cinematography -- brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!!! Buy this film...memorize it..show it to all of your friends and have the time of your life! The movie also doubles nicely as a stern warning for the future -- watch what your government is doing.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|Oldboy's beginning had me excited for the rest of the film.  I mean it is a great beginning.  Oh Dae-su is kidnapped from the middle of the street one night, and we then learn through his narration that he will be in his cell for the next 15 years.  We go through the journey with him, seeing the time pass by as he finds ways to get himself through each day.  Then, miraculously, he is released one day for what appears to be no reason whatsoever.  Once he is released, he sets out to find his captors.  The only clue he has is the food that he ate on every single day for the past 15 years, so he goes to every restaurant named Blue Dragon until he tastes the food he knows so well.  Once he finds out where he was kept, he has to find out who and why, and that is where the film goes crazy.<br /><br />The twists at the end of this film are some of the best I can think of from recent film history.  Not only is the subject matter hard to handle, but the film also features some horrible scenes of violence, and one scene where a live octopus was definitely harmed in the making of the film.  While I'm not in love with this movie (it definitely slows down after the beginning), it is more interesting and original than a lot of stuff that our country has put out recently.  And it was definitely good enough for me to check out the other two parts of Park's vengeance trilogy.

B000GRTQSE|5.0|There will be people who still believe Bob Dylan is over-rated. Younger audiences may be somewhat oblivious of the debt popular music owes this man. Rock and roll was child's play until Dylan, a folk singer indebted, in his own way, to the legendary Woody Guthrie, went electric. His folkie fans may have heckled him of the stage and called him a traitor to what they believed was, by virtue of its history and earnestness, the only adult music, but something magic happened: rock and roll grew up. <br /> <br />With Dylan leading the way forward, rock and roll didn't only absorb political and social comment, it became capable, at last, of articulating, often with inspirational lyricism, the full gamut of emotions in the human condition. Those that came before Dylan gave the spirit its flesh, but Dylan was the father of an animal capable of consciousness. <br /> <br />As with the excellent \\"Love and Theft\\", \\"Modern Times\\" returns to the heart of rock and roll: the blues. Dylan, though a scholar and a poet, presents himself as a babe yet again, before the seemingly unfathomable depths of the pulminary palate. As such, the album is somewhat of a lithmus test of intelligence. The album will possibly sound naive to the naive. Where is the insight into our times? Where are the songs as topical as \\"Hurricane\\" once was? The album's title is, of course, ironic. It is ineviatable that some will forget \\"The Chimes Of Freedom\\" wasn't exactly topical either, when it was released, but it definitely sounded that way. So it is with \\"Modern Times\\". Dylan has, again, crafted a timeless record that is among the best of his impressive career. <br /> <br />Before the first four notes of \\"Thunder On The Mountain\\" have finished playing, you know you are listening to a masterpiece. These notes, grand as they are in their simplicity, boldly announce this is Dylan with something important to say. The song then proceeds to chug along as swinging full-tilt boogie and drops a wicked quip about Alicia Keys, \\"I've been looking for her even clear through Tenessee\\". It's an amusing way of saying that, while \\"things have changed\\", Dylan still cares about music, particularly the way it empowers and unites people, emanicating all of us from slavery. At one point, Dylan even says he wants to stop thinking only about himself and see \\"what others need\\". Those who have accused him over the years of being some kind of fraud should take note that he quickly abandons all pretence about being any kind of voice of a generation by simply stating, \\"I've aleady confessed, I don't need to confess again.\\" <br /> <br />Not dissimilar to \\"Moonlight\\" on \\"Love and Theft\\", \\"Spirit On The Water\\" is delightfully antique in its composition, yet, strangely, it is imbibed with surprising youthful exuberance. It could have been written for a wallflower waltz. Dylan doesn't pull any punches when he sings, \\"You think I'm over the hill / You think I'm past my prime / Let me see what you've got / We could have a whoppin' good time.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Rollin' and tumblin\\" thumps hard and evokes the same level of seminal rage against the establishment as \\"Maggie's Farm\\". Dylan growls, \\"I aint nobody's houseboy.\\" But this isn't coming from an angry man; it's coming from a sage-like, lived-in  librettist. <br /> <br />\\"When The Deal Goes Down\\" actually has the audacity to thieve the words and melody of \\"In the still of the night ...\\", but that it's only part of its genius. Essentially a song about facing death with love in your heart, even the cliches (\\"we live and we die / And we know not why\\") still resonate as contemporary insights, especially when they are dressed with Dylan's trademark talent for expressing the most intimate details of the past as if they were happening immediately. I found myself a bit teary hearing his account of picking up a rose and feeling \\"transient joys\\". <br /> <br />\\"Someday Baby\\" is a raunchy I-aint-dead-yet-but-I-will-be-someday-and-you'll-be-haunted-by-absence anthem. Dylan scrutinizes his own inscrutable persona, singing, \\"I keep recycling the same thoughts\\" - only to further illuminate his legacy; \\"I don't wanna brag / I wanna ring your neck.\\" <br /> <br />In his book, \\"Chronicles\\", Dylan wrote at length about his own frustration over not being able, at the time, to give producer, Daniel Lanios, songs as great as \\"Chimes of Freedom\\". Well, that problem is solved in Dylan's 65th year with the breathtaking \\"Working Man's Blues 2\\". If this is not one of the greatest songs ever written, the earth is still flat. The lyrics are some Dylan's finest and they as relevant to the world under the rule of Bush's evil empire as they might have been to the time of the crusades. The words \\"The firepower of the proletariat's gone down / Money's gettin' shallow and weak ...\\" are crooned in honeyed voice to the dripping delicacies of piano-driven melody. Unlike lesser protest songs, it's the humility of the song that makes it so moving. Dylan wants to be remembered as a team player, \\"My crude weapons have been put on the shelf / Come sit on my knee ...\\" Nevertheless, how could anyone with a heart and any empathy whatsoever for other human beings refuse the following call to arms: \\"You can hang back or fight you best on the frontline...\\" <br /> <br />The slyly romantic Dylan tips his cowboy hat, once more, the power of love with \\"Beyond The Horizon\\". His most romantic visions are of a particularly modern time when we are all on \\"the same side\\", a time which he predicts will fittingly be \\"'round about midnight\\". <br /> <br />The name \\"Nettie Moore\\" is synonymous symbolically with triumph over slavery. Dylan crafts a song of the same name that is an ode to defiance and rebellion as a matter of conscience. When Dylan sings \\"The world has gone black before eyes\\", he singing about his own mortality of course, but surely he is also still struggling against a world that makes laws to silence protest under the guise of fighting terrorism.  <br /> <br />\\"The Levee Gonna Break\\" is another example of the brilliant breath of new life in ancient wisdom. Perhaps, the most deceptively simple of all the blues-boogie tunes on the album, it effortlessly carries what Dylan, hiimself, might call \\"big medicine\\" for our times, concluding with the ominous words, \\"Some people still sleeping / Some people are wide awake ...\\" <br /> <br />\\"Aint Talkin\\" ends the album with glorious compassion for the broken and forgotten. In the tradition of his best narrative songs, Dylan assumes the persona of an accident victim casually reporting \\"Someone hit from behind\\". It's a sad song, to be sure, mirroring a \\"world mysterious and vague\\": \\"The whole world is filled with speculation / The whole wide world which people say is round / They will tear your mind away from contemplation / They will jump on your misfortune when you're down ...\\" However, when Dylan says \\"no one will ever know\\" he is really convincing you of how important, how holy and divine it is to tell the tale. Even the cynics and the doubters have to agree when he sings, \\"Someday you'll be glad to have me around.\\" <br /> <br />This is easily the best album of 2006, every bit as urgent and important as those recordings that will still sound as good decades, even centuries from now.   <br />
B000FFL2I4|5.0|This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.<br /><br />The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.<br /><br />This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.<br /><br />Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was. It is, indeed, a moment to remember.ost convincing computer geek.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|Review:    Modern Times by Bob Dylan (2006)      There will be people who still believe Bob Dylan is over-rated. Younger audiences may be somewhat oblivious of the debt popular music owes this man. Rock and roll was child's play until Dylan, a folk singer indebted, in his own way, to the legendary Woody Guthrie, went electric. His folkie fans may have heckled him off the stage and called him a traitor to what they believed was, by virtue of its history and earnestness, the only adult music, but something magic happened: rock and roll grew up.    With Dylan leading the way forward, rock and roll didn't only absorb political and social comment, it became capable, at last, of articulating, often with inspirational lyricism, the full gamut of emotions in the human condition. Those that came before Dylan gave the spirit its flesh, but Dylan was the father of an animal capable of consciousness.    As with the excellent \\"Love and Theft\\", \\"Modern Times\\" returns to the heart of rock and roll: the blues. Dylan, though a scholar and a poet, presents himself as a babe yet again, before the seemingly unfathomable depths of the pulminary palate. As such, the album is somewhat of a lithmus test of intelligence. The album will possibly sound naive to the naive. Where is the insight into our times? Where are the songs as topical as \\"Hurricane\\" once was? The album's title is, of course, ironic. It is ineviatable that some will forget \\"The Chimes Of Freedom\\" wasn't exactly topical either, when it was released, but it definitely sounded that way. So it is with \\"Modern Times\\". Dylan has, again, crafted a timeless record that is among the best of his impressive career.    Before the first four notes of \\"Thunder On The Mountain\\" have finished playing, you know you are listening to a masterpiece. These notes, grand as they are in their simplicity, boldly announce this is Dylan with something important to say. The song then proceeds to chug along as swinging full-tilt boogie and drops a wicked quip about Alicia Keys, \\"I've been looking for her even clear through Tenessee\\". It's an amusing way of saying that, while \\"things have changed\\", Dylan still cares about music, particularly the way it empowers and unites people, emanicipating all of us from slavery. At one point, Dylan even says he wants to stop thinking only about himself and see \\"what others need\\". Those who have accused him over the years of being some kind of fraud should take note that he quickly abandons all pretence about being any kind of voice of a generation by simply stating, \\"I've aleady confessed, I don't need to confess again.\\"    Not dissimilar to \\"Moonlight\\" on \\"Love and Theft\\", \\"Spirit On The Water\\" is delightfully antique in its composition, yet, strangely, it is imbibed with surprising youthful exuberance. It could have been written for a wallflower waltz. Dylan doesn't pull any punches when he sings, \\"You think I'm over the hill / You think I'm past my prime / Let me see what you've got / We could have a whoppin' good time.\\"    \\"Rollin' and tumblin\\" thumps hard and evokes the same level of seminal rage against the establishment as \\"Maggie's Farm\\". Dylan growls, \\"I aint nobody's houseboy.\\" But this isn't coming from an angry man; it's coming from a sage-like, lived-in librettist.    \\"When The Deal Goes Down\\" actually has the audacity to thieve the words and melody of \\"In the still of the night ...\\", but that it's only part of its genius. Essentially a song about facing death with love in your heart, even the cliches (\\"we live and we die / And we know not why\\") still resonate as contemporary insights, especially when they are dressed with Dylan's trademark talent for expressing the most intimate details of the past as if they were happening immediately. I found myself a bit teary hearing his account of picking up a rose and feeling \\"transient joys\\".    \\"Someday Baby\\" is a raunchy I-aint-dead-yet-but-I-will-be-someday-and-you'll-be-haunted-by-absence anthem. Dylan scrutinizes his own inscrutable persona, singing, \\"I keep recycling the same thoughts\\" - only to further illuminate his legacy; \\"I don't wanna brag / I wanna ring your neck.\\"    In his book, \\"Chronicles\\", Dylan wrote at length about his own frustration over not being able, at the time, to give producer, Daniel Lanios, songs as great as \\"Chimes of Freedom\\". Well, that problem is solved in Dylan's 65th year with the breathtaking \\"Working Man's Blues 2\\". If this is not one of the greatest songs ever written, the earth is still flat. The lyrics are some Dylan's finest and they as relevant to the world under the rule of Bush's evil empire as they might have been to the time of the crusades. The words \\"The firepower of the proletariat's gone down / Money's gettin' shallow and weak ...\\" are crooned in honeyed voice to the dripping delicacies of piano-driven melody. Unlike lesser protest songs, it's the humility of the song that makes it so moving. Dylan wants to be remembered as a team player, \\"My crude weapons have been put on the shelf / Come sit on my knee ...\\" Nevertheless, how could anyone with a heart and any empathy whatsoever for other human beings refuse the following call to arms: \\"You can hang back or fight you best on the frontline...\\"    The slyly romantic Dylan tips his cowboy hat, once more, the power of love with \\"Beyond The Horizon\\". His most romantic visions are of a particularly modern time when we are all on \\"the same side\\", a time which he predicts will fittingly be \\"'round about midnight\\".    The name \\"Nettie Moore\\" is synonymous symbolically with triumph over slavery. Dylan crafts a song of the same name that is an ode to defiance and rebellion as a matter of conscience. When Dylan sings \\"The world has gone black before eyes\\", he singing about his own mortality of course, but surely he is also still struggling against a world that makes laws to silence protest under the guise of fighting terrorism.     \\"The Levee Gonna Break\\" is another example of the brilliant breath of new life in ancient wisdom. Perhaps, the most deceptively simple of all the blues-boogie tunes on the album, it effortlessly carries what Dylan, hiimself, might call \\"big medicine\\" for our times, concluding with the ominous words, \\"Some people still sleeping / Some people are wide awake ...\\"    \\"Aint Talkin\\" ends the album with glorious compassion for the broken and forgotten. In the tradition of his best narrative songs, Dylan assumes the persona of an accident victim casually reporting \\"Someone hit from behind\\". It's a sad song, to be sure, mirroring a \\"world mysterious and vague\\": \\"The whole world is filled with speculation / The whole wide world which people say is round / They will tear your mind away from contemplation / They will jump on your misfortune when you're down ...\\" However, when Dylan says \\"no one will ever know\\" he is really convincing you of how important, how holy and divine it is to tell the tale. Even the cynics and the doubters have to agree when he sings, \\"Someday you'll be glad to have me around.\\"    This is easily the best album of 2006, every bit as urgent and important as those recordings that will still sound as good decades, even centuries from now.
0156907399|5.0|I must say that I was amazed when I saw that a novel such as To the Lighthouse has averaged only four out of five stars. That a classic of literature wich has proven the test of time would score only four stars, when many poorly written contemporary novels receive five, is truly an irony of our age. As I looked over the reviews, I noted that there were some that gave the novel only one star! Usually these were from individuals that had a difficult time comprehending the book and could not make a distinction between that lack of comprehension and a piece of world class literature. Although one reviewer did acknowledge that she knew this was a fine twentieth century work, she still went on to give it one star. I think that this type of written review is necessary in order to let other readers know that it will be a difficult read; however, by giving it one star, the reviewer misleads by implying that the book is not worth reading, and this might discourage others from making the effort, and perhaps getting much more out of the novel than its one-star reviewers.    To the Lighthouse is worth the struggle if one is willing to put in the time. My recommendation to serious readers is to go to outside sources - either through Amazon, online resources, or the library - that will help in understanding the book. In this way a profound novel will get its due and readers will have the beautiful experience that only this book can afford.
0805076476|4.0|Fight Club is visceral, surreal, and very well-written. If you've seen the movie, you've practically read the book, as they're almost identical, right down to the grim, off-center narration by the main character. My reaction to both book and film are also nearly identical: They are both works of mind-blowing originality and fantastic execution and I did not enjoy either of them much at all. They were both worth the time, don't get me wrong, but I would be lying if I said that I actually enjoyed either of them. Such is life.
074322454X|4.0|I really can't add much to the reviews already written except to say that 'Band of Brothers' is a must read for WWII buffs or anyone interested in the brave acts that bring young men to perform totally without thought to themselves, but rather to their comrades.  As we have come to expect from Stephen Ambrose, the book is well written, well researched, and will keep you interested from cover to cover.  As I have said in some other of my reviews, \\"This one will make you want to go out and fly that American flag proudly.\\"
B000BRBA8S|5.0|A marvelous evocation on a hotel room.  Picking up where \\"In the Mood for Love\\" left off, Chow tries to track down his lost love, Su Li Zhen.  He finds himself in the same hotel, if not the same room, with a new set of relationships which are much more fluid in nature.  While he cannot commit himself to any one woman, he does seem to find some solace in the landlord's daughter, who helps him write a sci-fiction serial entitled 2046, where all time seems to have come to a standstill and he sublimates his love in androids.  Not even the lovely Bai Ling (Ziyi Zhang) can stir Chow from his fantasies.  It is only when he finds a similar namesake (Li Gong) that passions are aroused, but this Su Li Zhen is a professional gambler, who proves even more elusive than the first.<br /><br />2046 is sumptuously filmed with the same inescapable claustrophobia as \\"In the Mood for Love.\\"  About the only breath of fresh air was from the roof top balcony of the hotel.  Kar Wai Wong has a more modern sense than such Chinese contemporaries as Yimou Zhang, although they use many of the same actors.  Wong also did \\"Chungking Express,\\" which has a similar moody atmosphere.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I love BRAVE NEW WORLD and I think DANCE OF DEATH has some very fine moments but pales in comparison to its predecessor overall (except \\"Rainmaker\\", \\"Paschendale\\" and \\"Dance of Death\\" -- all absolutely amazing).<br /><br />AMOLAD is a return to BNW form although it doesn't quite reach the perfection of \\"Wicker Man\\", \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"Blood Brothers\\" on first or second listen.  That said, it's a very good album with no real duds and quite a few brilliant songs.<br /><br />Songs I totally dig:  Different World, These Colours Don't Run, Longest Day, For The Greater Good of God, Lord of Light.<br /><br />Caveats:  Sounds quality is enigmatic.  It's cleaner than DOD (very clangy mix with audible distortion at times) but Bruce's vocals still seem recessed to me.  The man has an amazing voice so it should be front and center in the mix.  Guitars aren't as heavy as BNW or past albums.  This is almost a prog mix with shades of Tool.  Again, not a bad sound but not exactly my ideal mix.  Mastering is a necessary evil and should always be done by a pair of objective ears.  The lack of mastering is perplexing since Kevin Shirley is clearly too deaf to hear distortion in the mix (see DANCE OF DEATH).<br /><br />Lyrically, the band is better than ever.  Very mature work in that regard.  I sense a new-found sense of spirituality and the strong condemnation of religious extremism (i.e., Islam in \\"Greater Good of God\\") is refreshing.  Closing verse on that song is just brilliant.  You nailed it on this one, guys.<br /><br />\\"Lord of Light\\" is also noteworthy in its time-changes and the killer Good/Evil vocal delivery by Bruce.  It's a sinister bit of epic metal that really crushes.<br /><br />Right now, here's my list of top Maiden albums overall:  1.  BRAVE NEW WORLD  2. SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON  3. A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH  4. THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST  5. DANCE OF DEATH<br /><br />So, yeah, there ya go.  A pretty dang good album all in all.  Maiden just keeps pushing forward with their renewed vigor and they seem pretty much unstoppable.  Remarkable turnaround.  Keep it up, guys.ith their renewed vigor and they seem pretty much unstoppable.  Remarkable turnaround.  Keep it up, guys.
B000002KY8|5.0|Although Prince had been putting out a stream of R&B hits for years before, this album really put Prince into the mainstream. A massive hit, this album stayed on the charts for years, spinning off several hit singles, highlighted by the two biggest, \\"1999\\", the title track, and \\"Little Red Corvette\\", Prince's biggest hit to that point. \\"Delirious\\" and \\"Let's Pretend We're Married\\" also hit the charts, and the album went on to sell over two million copies. Prince has never been one to trim anything, being more than willing to play a nine or ten minute song just to get the groove going, and this album has many songs clocking in at nine+ minutes. The revealing thing is that you're never bored with it. The vocal work here is outstanding. The multi-voice lead, used so perfectly in \\"1999\\", is first used on this album, and it realy was a unique thing to hear, especially on a Prince album. There are many funky grooves to get down to, and some really steamy slow-downs to enjoy as well. Truthfully, many consider this album to be Prince's true masterwork, better even than \\"Purple Rain\\", the album that made him a mega-star. Even though I don't think this myself, I can see why so many are enamored of this album. It rocks, it's funky, it's danceable, it's slinky. Get this album even if you're not a Prince fan. It's definately one of his all-time best, which means it's a true work of art!
1594200823|5.0|Mr. Pollan has written an excellent book on food and, as other reviewers have noted, makes you think about where your food came from and how it was raised. This was a well-written, interesting read though not a short read. <br /> <br />If you are a vegetarian, you should probably read the first review from VegNews and leave it at that. Mr. Pollan and I both like meat so I got over that part pretty quickly. But having been to Dodge City, KS in the summer time, feedlots are incredibly disgusting places.  <br /> <br />Mr. Pollan's writeup of major corn Agibusiness makes you want te read the labels on everything -- who the hell knew that farm raised salmon is fed corn?? -- and probably buy stock in Archer Daniels Midland. <br /> <br />I think the theme that I really liked the best in the book was the slow food 'community' vice fast food eat in the car theme. Both meals he cooks are with family and friends and they sound like wonderful meals with fascinating company. The MacDonalds meal is just like the thousands that I have probably consumed - in a car at 66 miles an hour.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|There's not too much I can offer here, since I found very little to grab my attention throughout this movie.  A lot of nice shots of the robots in this, and the color tweaking really did help keep the cgi effects seem more real in their settings.  I'm sure there has been some debate over the use of Sir Laurence Olivier in this movie, but that's not something that I think really applies to my overall sense of the film.<br /><br />I am sure that a lot of nostalgia and sentimentality can be attached to this film in the way it pays homage to classic science fiction and old cinema.  A lot of the camera angles, costumes, the shapes of the robots and weapons, all reminisce upon cinema and comic books of yore, and in concept this film is a good reminder of those days of pure invention in science fiction, as silly as they may look to us today.<br /><br />But this trip down memory lane was down a poorly chosen lane.  There are plenty of comic books and movies of the time that were also very eerily accurate in their predictions of the future, and because of that they're not often harked upon.  Instead, this film goes for the silly sci-fi and wraps it in a package that was clearly tweaked by many a studio executive to make sure there were romantic moments, a spiffy sidekick, and enough explosions to keep popcorn eaters eating.<br /><br />This movie felt like a lot of effort with little substance.
0786939532|5.0|The sad truth is that these TSR novels, or I guess Wizards of the Coast now (even though Hasbro bought them out) is that they were fun in HIgh School when I was constantly wanting to play AD&D and not having friends to do it with, and generally hated life most of the time.  But all these years later, as an adult, I shudder at the poor quality of most of them -- trash fantasy really.<br /><br />HOWEVER, this book rises very far above all of it peers and is genuinely really good fantasy, with a particularly strong focus on right and wrong.  I just reread it after 16 years, and am still strongly impressed and couldn't put it down.  It is not Tolkien by a long shot, but few things indeed reach those lofty heights.
B00005JP87|4.0|THE ILLUSIONIST is a very interesting movie that nonetheless falls short.  It fails to achieve the emotional impact it is clearly striving for.  It has an intellectual impact, it pleases because it shows a time and situation unfamiliar to us and it entertains with its originality and execution.  But at no time are we caught up in a sweep of emotions.  We observe from a distance.<br /><br />It tells the story of Eisenheim The Illusionist (Edward Norton), an unparalled \\"magician\\" who returns to his childhood home of Vienna after traveling the world in search of the greatest illusions ever seen.  He causes an immediate stir with his brilliance, and attracts the attention of the young heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne (Rufus Sewell) and his young bride-to-be (Jessica Biehl), who also happens to be the childhood sweetheart of Eisenheim.<br /><br />They rekindle their relationship.  Meanwhile, Eisenheim has captured the interest of young royal heir, and not in a good way.  The prince imagines that he is smarter than Eisenheim, and when he can't immediately expose the method behind the illusions, he becomes resentful, and sends the police (led by Paul Giamatti) on a mission to destroy Eisenheim.<br /><br />It's a good story, and it takes some nice turns, particularly when Eisenheim and his true love conspire to get away from the prince...and the seemingly tragic results of that effort.  The movie beautifully captures old Vienna.  It is remarkably intelligent and doesn't insult its audience.  And it has some really great magic tricks.  Naturally, we know the tricks are created through special effects...however, what is GREAT is that the film allows us to sort of put ourselves in the audience of late 19th century Vienna...and to feel just a little how stunning his illusions would have been.  We spend the whole movie wondering if he is an illusionist or if he really can do the tricks.<br /><br />Edward Norton is very intense in his role, and with his VanDyke beard, he looks terrific.  A true leading-man kind of part for him.  He's riveting.  Giamatti and Sewell have terrible facial hair, but otherwise do nice work.  Giamatti does struggle a bit making his \\"Viennese\\" accent believable, though.  Biehl, while hardly asked to leap through huge dramatic hoops, does just fine amongst these greater actors...and  I suppose if you're one of those who voted her \\"Sexiest Woman Alive,\\" you'll probably enjoy her a great deal.<br /><br />But somehow, the movie remains distant emotionally in telling the romance.  We just don't CARE all that much.  Yes, we want the good guys to win and the bad guys to get their comeuppance.  But not in a deep way.  No tears are shed.  The movie spends so much time EXAMINING things...the illusions, the schemes, the political machinations...that it forgets to just let emotion run free a bit.  It's very controlled and has a leisurely pace.<br /><br />I admire it a great deal, and recommend it.  It's PG-13, but except for one brief \\"bedroom\\" scene with Norton and Biehl that isn't terribly explicit, I think it could almost have been PG.  Don't expect to be blown away, but do enjoy being taken to another time and another mindset for 2 hours.rd, he looks terrific.  A true leading-man kind of part for him.  He's riveting.

B000H7JD4K|5.0|There isn't a single song worth skipping over on this album. It doesn't have that many tracks that just kick your teeth in like Powerslave or something, but comparing any of their new work to any of their work from the 70's and 80's is just pointless. The band is in a different place now as they mature as musicians. The fact that they can still make amazing music in 2006 should be celebrated. And it is an amazing album. I don't like it as much as Brave New World (my favorite of their current line-up), but ALMOST.....time will tell if it reaches that level for me.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I bought it on the spur of the moment, local Starbucks. I'm so glad I listened to my impulse. I have always liked Bob Dylan, but I never have bought any of his CD's.  The only concert I've seen was at the Hollywood Bowl in 1973.   <br />Words can't express how much I've enjoyed the CD. The songs stay with you, I've been singing them in my head for a week now.  The more I listen, the more I enjoy it. Blusey, soulful, toe tapping.  <br />
B00000JXHB|5.0|To Amazon's Roni Sarig; I am happy for you that Amazon has outsourced their music reviewing operation to Calcutta, but get a clue Roni.  <br /> <br />Amazon, you need a clue also. How you can allow a reviewer with no knowledge, appreciation or affinity for a genre write your review is unfathomable to anyone with any of the above. The selection of material for a \\"Best of\\" from a band's body of work will always be an arguable topic, but the musicianship of the Outlaws will always stand out of the crowd. To be able to hear anything from Ghost Riders or Playin' to Win is a treat. This is a great CD to have because these songs will play consecutively on my player.  <br /> <br />Underrated, under-publicized and under appreciated for what they did in their day. Southern Rock as good as it gets. <br /> <br />
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I have been a fan of the Silent Hill games for some time now.  I will even go as far to say that Silent Hill just may be the best video game series out right now (certainly the best survival horror series, and I love the RE games as well!).  I have played through most of 1 and read the rest of the story, and I've beaten every other game in the series.    This movie is great because of many different reasons.  The first, of course being the special effects.  The director re-creates the \\"world\\" of Silent Hill masterfully and it helps that he's played the games.  The monsters look like they came straight from the game (which some of them did)and are all connected to the overall story (much like in the games).    A second reason why this movie is so great is because if you've never played the games, you can still enjoy it as a great horror film.  But if you are a Silent Hill fan, than you will be rewarded when watching this movie and you'll find yourself many times saying \\"I remember playing that\\" or \\"I remember fighting that monster\\" and playing the games also helps you understand the overall story.    And I have also found that most people who have watched this movie and give it \\"horrible\\" ratings just don't understand the story and that pisses them off.  I'll explain the whole story here:    ***SPOILERS AHEAD!!****              Ok, Now the story goes like this there are 3 dimensions of Silent Hill.    1-Regular Silent Hill, anyone can go there, exsists in the real world  2-Foggy Silent Hill, only those that have a secret in their past or have something to do with the towns history may go there, doesn't exsist in the real world  3-Hell Silent Hill, the ones who are in \\"Foggy Silent Hill\\" can go here, exsists when the foggy silent hill changes to a blood encrusted, rusty, hell hole.    Now Rose and her daughter(Sharon) did exsist in the Real World until they entered Silent Hill, they were then transported into \\"Foggy Silent Hill\\" because of the daughters connection tothe Town.  Once you enter the \\"Foggy Silent Hill\\" you can never totally leave.  You're basically stuck in the alternate dimension of \\"Foggy Silent Hill\\", hence the end of the movie where Rose and the daughter are at the house but the husband can't see them and the world they're in is all foggy.    Now The alternate and foggy Silent Hill's are both created by Alessa after she is burned by the cult.  She gets these powers from \\"The Reaper\\" (which some call Satan) because her hatred is so strong.  The \\"Alternate Silent Hill\\" is actually Alessa's darkest nightmare being brought to life to exact revenge upon those who have done wrong to her.  Now this is just a thin overview of how the story all ties together, I will now go into what the monsters in this movie symbolize.    --The monster which looks like a person trapped in a skin bag and shoots black acid out of its chest represents Alessas feeling of being trapped in her hideous body and the black acidic liquid represents Alessa lashing out at the world    --Pyramid Head has really no connection to Alessa directly, hes just a cool character from Silent Hill 2 and just symbolizes judgement.    --Crawling Man is the janitor who molested Alessa.  He is forced to drag his pelvic region across the floor in torture and his flickering tongue represents his extreme perversion.    --The nurses represent Alessa being jealous of the nurses who took care of her and their beauty so she takes away their beautiful faces but you can still see that they were good looking because their bodies remained untouched.    --The gray children are actually the children who tortured Alessa while she was alive and Alessa punishes them by making them hideous to anyone who sees them    Now theres more to the story and if you have any questions about the plot of the movie or the games, feel free to e-mail me at jersey16@tampabay.rr.com and I will do my best to explain them for you.
B000002U9W|4.0|Ok, its kind of like this, you are either going to love this album or hate it. I dont think there is much in between a true floyd head. My first impression of the album is that Alan Parsons Project and Pink Floyd mated and this is the love child. Then lo and behold I see that Parsons was an engineer on the Album.I am not sure if he influenced this album or it influenced him, but there is a real similarity in sound. I like APP, but lets face it, Parsons project is the MUZAK of progressive rock. And thats alot of what the feel of this album was to me, of a pretty decent Floyd album trying to break out of a Parsons'esque cocoon of cheesey orchestra and chorus. And it does that to a pretty fair degree, enough to save the album. There are some stunning bluesy interludes, some really cool atmospheric psychedelic sequences, and some warm folksey acoustic stuff. Some of the tracks are bizare to the point of being funny. And even though the space between this album and Dark side of the Moon is punctuated by that masterpiece of psychedelica, Meddle, you can start to kind of hear the Dark side of the moon sound here. Its sort of like the beginning of the transition from the old floyd to the more pop floyd. At any rate I love this album, its a great listen, and it grows on you. I would recomend it to anyone who wants to collect the whole catalog.

B000HC2LIK|5.0|I love this movie and I have been waiting for a remastered version since 1997.  Come on, the first transfer was horrible.  We all know that.  I know there is a great addition coming in 2007 but i couldn't wait to see Blade Runner remastered. I'm not going to go on and on about the movie because all of you Blade Runner fans out there know what's up.  My main reason for writing this review was to dicuss the transfer. <br /> <br />The transfer is definitely better than the one you are all used to.  I'm pretty picky and to be honest, i was not 100% impressed.  I guess since it took so long I was expecting more.  From the beginning you can spot all that grain and noise we are all used to.  i guess i was just expecting a tranfer like Alien or Apocalypse now.  The picture is definitely clearer and the colors are more vibrant.  I have a feeling that they could have done a little bit better though.  Just wanted to voice my opinion to all the blade runner fans out there who can't wait to see the tranfer.  But keep in mind, when it comes to DVDs,  I'm a little bit picky.
B000EQH2QK|3.0|When Shakira relased her English debut Laundry Service in 2001, it debuted at #3 due to the popularity of the hit single \\"Whenever, Whatever\\". Although none of the other singles from that album garnered that same acclaim, the album was still selling quite well, so I picked it up but I wasn't impressed; not because of her singing voice (which has an acquired taste), but because the lyrics weren't great. And when she released the Spanish-language album Fijaci&oacute;n Oral Vol. 1 earlier last year, I figured that artists like her (and Thal&iacute;a) were sticking with what they did best. But still came Oral Fixation Vol. 2.<br /><br />There are a few songs on here that are actually impressive, like the lead single \\"Don't Bother\\" and also \\"Dreams For Plans\\". But I agree with everyone else that \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" is the best song (although it's much more effective when you're watching the video), but what I DON'T understand is why people are so upset that it wasn't on the original release of the album; I mean, albums get re-released all the time (The Emancipation of Mimi, anyone?).<br /><br />Questionable lyrics plague THIS album too, however, as evidenced by the Carlos Santana-assisted \\"Illegal\\", which features lyrics like \\"I'm starting to think it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart.\\" \\"Hey You\\" is corny, and when I saw a lot of reviewers calling \\"Timor\\" a political song, I was like, \\"THAT'S what that song is about?\\" because I couldn't make any sense out of it. I didn't understand \\"Costume Makes the Clown\\" either.<br /><br />Shakira does have talent, but she seriously needs to improve her lyrical skills. I was going to say that this album is worth borrowing but not buying, but then I realized that like the case with the Pussycat Dolls' album PCD, I doubt most men bought Oral Fixation Vol. 2 to listen to the MUSIC anyway. Ah well.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000FFJ85I|4.0|If you thought \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" was a bad sell-out album, I advise you avoid this album too. AFI could care less about punk cred, and for that I totally respect them. Some of its detractors don't even know how long the band's been around really anyway. But that point aside, I really do enjoy \\"Decemberunderground\\". It's got some elements of the current industrial/\\"futurepop\\" music a la VNV Nation, De/Vision, etc., as well as the trademark AFI songs. I like the tracks where Davey Havok screams through them, it adds hardcore intensity to a few tracks, and was one of the band's strengths. If you like the goth side of AFI, you'll love this album. <br /> <br />The lead single \\"Miss Murder\\" has some Green Day bass with a bunch of hooks, and an addictive bridge. The intro track is really interesting as well. There's intensity of \\"Affliction\\" and \\"Kill Caustic\\" that totally pulls me in for listening. Almost everything here is a winner. I have to say that Havok is still a great vocalist, and that musically this is some of their best stuff, getting more deep than previously. <br /> <br />My only complaints about \\"Decemberunderground\\" are that the song \\"Summer Shudder\\" sounds like Hawthorne Heights with an added futurepop influence and they seem to be the type who thinks singing about death/suicide is \\"deep\\" and \\"artistic\\". However, the good things about the album far outweigh these and \\"Decemberunderground\\" is one of the greatest albums I've heard of 2006.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|I was not bowled over by \\"Octavarium\\", and knowing that \\"Score\\" has five songs from that disc I didn't rush to the store the day it came out like I usually do when DT releases something new. I waited two days. Well, after listening to it several times I'm impressed. How could musicians of this caliber not impress? Anyway, the gem on this DVD is the entire forty-one minute version (with full orchestra) of one of the greatest DT songs ever, \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\". Wow! This song alone is worth the asking price, but fans get two hours and forty minutes of music, clear video and professional editing, ear pleasing audio options (stereo and DD 5.1), and some outstanding bonus features on disc two that include - an hour long band documentary, three bonus tracks, and a three minute animated short.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is an amazing DVD from one of the best prog-metal bands ever, and if you favor DT's latest release over previous works, this will be a treasure.   <br />
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I purchased this album pre-sale from sancutary, and let me tell you, well worth the wait.  All Ten tracks from \\"A Different World\\" through \\"The Legacy\\" are all just Excellent.  Again, maiden mixes some fast tracks and long, epic tracks to make a sound that has not been heard since the Somewhere In Time/Piece of Mind/Seventh Son Era's.  My personal favorites are A Different World, Brighter Than A Thousand Suns, and The Reincarnation of Benjamion Breeg.  The shortest track on this album is Different World 4:18, and the longest For The Greater Good Of God (9:24).  The deuling guitars with powerful rhytm lines and great melody are all here.  The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg is my favorite tune on this album, and was a great choice as the first single.  It is reminiscent of \\"Flight of Icarus\\" from Piece of Mind.  GET THIS ALBUM, new fans and old fans will all appreciate this album.      The Bonus DVD is also good incentive.  30 minutes of Maiden in the Studio, the Full seven minute video of Bejamin Breeg, Live in studio performance of Different World (4 minutes), and 4 minutes worth of photo gallery... Well worth it.  And during this first week, while ther are many sales around town, No excuse not to pick up the Limited Edition and all the goodies that go with it (patches, T-Shirts, other CD's).
B00028HBKM|5.0|But what is harder is reading some of the bigoted anti Christian views some reviewers have.  Our culture loves to identify stereotypes and lump the group togather, let me show you,  \\"I am a white male Evangelical Christian\\".  With that statement some of you probably think you can say which way I vote, wether my wife works, how I feel about African Americans, Undocumented immigrants, abortion, homosexual marriages, etc.  Some of the things you think may be right, some are most certainly wrong.  But all are stereotypes and some of you may have more in common with the halfwit reading \\"Turner Diaries\\" than you may wish to acknowledge.
B000G03Q2S|3.0|I don't know, maybe it's just that I'm jaded, or maybe there just isn't enough there to really justify a \\"limited edition 40th anniversery edition.\\"  I was really excited to get this, but its mostly retread.  The booklet is virtually the same as the 1999 mono/stereo release (now THAT was a big deal!).  It merely adds a paragraph by Mark Linett at the start about the 5.1 mix.      The CD is EXACTLY the same as that 1999 release, so that leaves us with disc number 2, which contains the \\"exclusive\\" pet sound videos and the 5.1 mix.  Well, it turns out that much of the video portion has shown up in other Beach Boy videos, and that which is exclusive is pretty lame (the George Martin segment, for example).      OK, it's really nice to have a 5.1 mix of Pet Sounds (hell, I was in heaven with the stereo mix), so I'm grateful.  But still, the sound is rather anemic (why no DTS?), and the vocals are in the rear, which is a bit odd.  (Since I originally wrote this I did find the DTS version, and it blows this away, sound-wise)    I'm not sorry I bought this.  Pet Sounds is one of the true landmark LPs of modern music, and at least whoever controls the Beach Boys music is making some sort of effort, unlike what is happening with the Beatles' catalog, i.e. NOTHING!      So, though I was disappointed with this release, at least there is SOME product for the Beach Boys/Pet Sounds fan to acquire.
B00006FDCD|3.0|I'm assuming that you've come here looking for a review on the DVD presentation of the film, right?<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />The film originally aired in two parts on ABC, so this film is split over both sides of the disc. I'm not big on the whole flipping thing when it comes to DVDs but it's understandable here.... if only sort of.<br /><br />The thing that actually gets on my nerves about this DVD is that the disc doesn't tell you what side you're putting on. Looking at the disc, there is no indication of whether you're about to play side A or side B and it's annoying to have to wait until the disc is playing to see whether you're watching the right one. This in itself is just irresponsible on the part of the manufacturers.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />Picture quality is good and the Dolby Surround sound is good also, if nothing awe inspiring. The film is presented nicely at the least.<br /><br />The DVD commentary by director Tommy Lee Wallace and actors Henry Thomas, Tim Reid, Dennis Christopher and the late John Ritter is actually a lot of fun. These guys laugh so much and have so much fun remembering their work on \\"It\\" that you can't help but crack up everytime someone makes a smart remark. John Ritter especially was a hoot to listen to and listening to this commentary made me a little melancholy to know he died so young.<br /><br />So there you have it. I happen to like this film, even if I prefer the book much more and the ending for the film was almost pathetic (admit it, that spider was just a big joke). Still, the film has a dynamite first half and great acting by not only the adults but the kids as well. It's genuinely frightening at times and Tim Curry makes for one scary clown.<br /><br />Not the best presentation in the world but I'd still recommend it, at least for the commentary.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|It is defined still today as one of the most socialists film to come out from mainstream Hollywood.  Contains scenes of authoritarian brutality and the awakening of proletarian consciousness.  A film like this would be impossible in today's political context, and for sure it will not win Oscars (nowadays some throwaway things like \\"Crash\\" get the golden uncle).  Despite a populist epilogue added by master producer Zanuk the events depicted in the film remain as the strongest warning against capitalism that I ever seen from an American movie.  Greg Tolland's photography and the sweeping force of the story will blow you away.<br /><br />DVD Extras: Shame on Fox.  Instead of receiving interesting documentaries about the Depression, its worldwide effects (Hitler) and how the country got out of it we get a love letter to John Ford boss, the big shot producer Zanuk.  Exactly the opposite of the message of 'Grapes', this extra is a promo for the way of making business that took the States well inside the biggest slump in its history.
1932100385|5.0|Did you ever wonder what the result would be if scientists did a study involving thousands of people with drastically different diets and followed those people for years?  Wonder no more.  This book is a culmination of just such a study.  The authors spearheaded the China Study and worked along many other researchers of all stripes in reaching their conclusion:  that the diet most likely to lead to longevity and good health is a plant-based diet with as little animal protein as possible. <br /> <br />     The Campbells (a father & son team) present overwhelming evidence to support their conclusion.  In one part, the authors show a person's vascular scan and another scan of that same person after 6 months on a plant-based diet.  You can see how much more blood was able to reach the heart, brain, and extremeties in the after photo.  My only problem with the book is that I now find it difficult to enjoy a juicy steak without wondering what effects the animal fat and protein will have on all of my body's systems.
B00000IL29|5.0|Why go to a lot of trouble to discuss in depth one of the greatest jazz albums ever crafted? <br /> <br />Well, let me just say: <br /> <br />If you consider yourself a Jazz Fan. . .then you NEED this album. <br /> <br />It is not the ONLY ALBUM . . .or anything like that. . .but this continues to be an influence on anyone serious about jazz. <br /> <br />It is one of the twenty greatest jazz albums of all time.  <br /> <br />Chris Tune
B000H7JD4A|5.0|Well a much anticipated album and yes it is in true Maiden style... <br />This album does take a bit of getting used to. So far it is taken me quite a few listens before I have really caught on to the songs and go away humming them in my head. The album has a sound of all the last 3 or so albums, particularly `The X-Factor' and I am hearing a lot of Bruce's solo work coming out in Maiden too. The album has its war theme through out and the guys really have caught the emotions and feel of being in one I think. `Different World' Hmm... not quite Iron Maiden really, reminds me of `Rainmaker' very commercial but still is a good song. `These Colours Don't Run' is going to be a Maiden trademark. `Brighter Than a Thousand Suns' this song is just so powerful and well written with Maiden grunge. `The Pilgrim' you can tell Janick had a lot of input into this one. It has his trademark type guitar riff where I can see him on stage doing his walk-in-one-spot routine. `The Longest Day' - Dudes this song is awesome, great lyrics, and an opening you want to hear over and over again. I thought they should have kept with the style that the song opens in rather than change their style all the time (which is just like maiden anyway really). `Out of the Shadows' is kind of a Maiden ballad, still heavy but more slowly paced. `TROBB', this is one of the best songs on the album and i can't stop listening to it. Maiden have turned this into an awesome song which borders (I think) on being a bit commercial... but not quite!!?? It is like `Infinite Dreams' it will be very popular but it will be one of those ones that they wont play anymore, which is a shame. Also WHO IS BENJAMIN BREEG, this is driving a lot of the community out there insane, is it Eddie? Is it Maiden themselves? `For the Greater Good of God' in depth and with a lot of feeling. This will be played at concerts! `Lord of Light' Great song, catchy and will be another popular Maiden song by the fans. `The Legacy' as `Arry says this opens like a nursery rhyme. Top song and will be another Iron Maiden favourite! <br /> <br />So the album itself overall `AWESOME', give it a chance I guarantee it WILL grow on you. Usually they have one cruddy song on all albums that you skip over, not this one... Maiden has experimented I think and it really has paid off and Nicko is fantastic (being a drummer myself). It's hard to believe that they got this done in two months and they didn't record it one instrument at a time. Get the Limited Edition DVD if you can as it contains two videos `TROBB and Different World' and over 30 minutes of info on the guys recording the new album. <br /> <br />Maiden fans won't be disappointed! Another classic album on the rise! <br />
B000003489|5.0|Giant Steps is well understood by jazz musicians.  The sound is mysterious and clearly mathematical, but the chord progression is simply based upon root movement through and Augmented triad (D, Bb, Gb, for example) with a Dominant seventh chord preceding each root; thus, D; F7; Bb; Db7; Gb; A7; D and then on through the other root centers - (there are only four such cycles, each based upon an augmented triad -- i.e. a chord made up solely of major thirds). <br /> <br />The remaining cycles are C; E; G#  B; G; Eb and A; F; Db <br /> <br />The fact that Coltrane could improvise at hard bop tempos over this with great intensity and emotion, is tribute to the human mind's rationality.  That is not what many would attribute to John Coltrane, but that is what is happening when you hear this.   <br /> <br />Somebody was so inclined to devote themselves to this kind of systematic approach to harmony and developed a melody and jazz \\"arrangement\\" that allowed for this kind of \\"mind blowing\\" movement through audio space! <br /> <br />Listening to this music as a \\"trained\\" musician, I am always astounded at the fluency that Trane developed over this chording.  He was truly a devoted master of jazz. <br /> <br />If you study jazz. . .love jazz. . .or even just kinda \\"like jazz\\", you owe it to yourself to hear what the pure fusion of man's mind and musical work can achieve.  <br /> <br />This album is not just for those who yearn for mind-bendingly fast hard bop lines.  Listen to \\"Naima\\" for the mellowness of a soft spirit. . .a peace that comes from mastery.  <br /> <br />Enjoy.  <br /> <br />Chris Tune <br />

B00005JNEI|1.0|The problem with Michael Moore's movies is that he's got an agenda to push. Forget about offering counter arguments. Case in point: Fahrenheit 9/11. This movie is chuck full of clips taken entirely out of context and purposely made to look George Bush stupid with \\"dumb music\\" playing in the background. There are clips that are supposed to show the President's ineffectiveness but they are utterly pointless. Let's take the scene where George Bush is at the elementary school and he's told the news about the Twin Towers by his secret service agent. The President continues to sit in the classroom listening to the child who's talking. I suppose that the purpose of this scene is to show how idiotic the President was by not reacting. Firstly, we don't know what the President was told exactly. No one knew at the time that the attack on the Twin Towers was a terrorist act. Secondly, what exactly did Moore expect the President to do? Panic and leave? Tell the child who's speaking to stop and run out? What he did instead was to do what we would expect a President to do during a time of crisis: he kept his cool and left the school without raising any alarms in front of little children. There is another clip where the President says that he's not concerned about Osama Bin-Laden. Again, this clip was taken out of context. The President has said repeatedly that he's not interested in individuals in the axis of terror but the entire network.  <br /> <br />Whether or not you're a George W. Bush fan, Michael Moore's work is here to appeal to our emotions and spin the facts. This movie deserves zero stars. <br />

B00005JOYM|4.0|Released by Paramount, August 9, 2006.<br />  Director Oliver Stone was very careful not to film the horrible scenes of September 11, 2001 we have already seen many times on the news.  You will not see any scenes of the crashes, not the impact which is already subliminally in our mind.  Stone shows only a shadow of a plane and then a sound effect followed by people's reaction.Their is nothing offensive in this film.  The action and hydrinoline is quite toned down.  Their is no mention of the Middle East or the politics in this film.<br />  The movie mostly focuses on two New York City Port Authority policemen played by Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena pinned under the rubble.<br />  The real-life policemen and survivors John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno make a cameo appearance. Will Jimeno is seen several times in the film. He iss the Port Authority Officier who says \\"Sarg\\" as Nicholas cage runs towards the group with papers flying outside, and is seen hugging actor, Michael Pena at end of film. Nicholas Cage shakes hands with John McLoughlin.<br />  For those who care, this film might make a lump in your throat. The scenes of the men down in the rubble really put you there.<br />  Some people have become cynical, but their are many stories that could be told here about 9/11.  This story has a good ending.<br />  Only 20 people were found alive in the World Trade Center Towers rubble.<br />  Also in the cast: Jay Hernandez as \\"Dominick Pezzulo\\", Danny Nucci as \\"Officier Giraldi\\", Stoney Westmoreland as \\"Paddy McGee\\".

B000HC2LIK|5.0|I agree with the previous reviewer that while the transfer is definitley better, it seems more could have been done when you compare older movies that have been remastered with better results like said \\"Alien\\". Otherwise, it is still a great remaster that shows BR at it's best for now and makes the movie have that much more eyecandy. It's alot less washed out and more defined and colorful. Also, the new anamorphic aspect ratio is a great addition.  <br /> <br />It's all up to you if it's worth buying considering the 3/4 disk box set is coming out next year. I for one couldn't wait to see BR at it's best visually and I bet their will be many who do the same.

0553583182|5.0|I remember walking into an auto parts store and looking at the clerk behind the counter and said, \\"Yeah, uhhhh, hi...I'm looking for an owner's manual for my vehicle.\\"<br /><br />He pointed to a rack of manuals and he said, \\"Try looking in that rack...\\"<br /><br />\\"No, you don't seem to understand. I'm looking for the owner's manual for a 1965 John Morgan.\\"<br /><br />\\"Uhhhh..sir?\\"<br /><br />\\"Me! Me! You fool! Can't you see that I don't know how to live my own life?\\"<br /><br />After they called security and I was released as a \\"non-threat\\" I went on my way...<br /><br />(The following was a dramatization for pure entertainment value. No animals were hurt during this portion of the review)<br /><br />I forgot who wrote it, maybe it was Thoreau, but I remember reading something that went, \\"we do not see things as they are, we see things as we are...\\" This statement is not to be taken lightly for the implications are absolutely enormous. Basically it says that all I experience in the world is based upon what I believe about the world. My world is all about me just like your world is all about you. We like to think that there is something called reality, but there really isn't. Everyone's reality is different. Everyone's reality is based upon primarily what people believe to be true.<br /><br />Did you know that the majority of our beliefs have been formed and firmly established by the time we are only five years old? Frightening to think that the majority of us are only operating on a five year old's belief system.<br /><br />Most of us never even question why we believe what we believe. we just believe it. If you ask someone why they believe what they believe, they usually will say, \\"I dunno...I just have always believed it...\\"<br /><br />No, you haven't. There was a time when you didn't believe what you believe now. There was a time when you and I just accepted or dismissed certain beliefs because we either agreed with something or we didn't. I used to believe that I was stupid. Why? Because my cousins told me I was. I was just a little kid but I remember my big older cousin calling me stupid. I really looked up to this guy. I wanted to please him I wanted him to like me so I just accepted his label with no questions asked. But would I have been so quick to agree with him if he had called me a penguin? Of course not, that's preposterous. Of course I'm not a penguin, but I am stupid, thank you for asking.<br /><br />Geesh.<br /><br />This book really gets into the nitty gritty of things. It really made me question everything I was believing. After reading this book thoroughly and carefully, I sat down one fine day and wrote down as many of my beliefs I could think of and my list looked like a list of the Who's Who List of Disempowered People. I believed I was ugly...I was skinny...I was unattractive...God didn't love me...people were mean, selfish, aggravating...I was poor, unqualified (for what?), lazy, evil, bad...on and on and on...brings tears to my eyes just thinking of those things I used to uphold as true.<br /><br />Slowly, with the help of Murphy's sage advice, I began repeating positive affirmations about myself and it was about as easy as taming a wild bronco. Oh, my mind really kicked up a fuss. \\"What? You are not beautiful...you are ugly...c'mon, please! You are not rich, you are lousy with money...there is no way that God is Love...God is going to throw you in hell for saying that...\\" And it went on like that for several months, there are still those days were I have outbreaks of self-loathing, but I just calmly assert the Truth, \\"I am self-empowered. I am self-actualized. I have come to this life to live and to live abundantly well...\\"<br /><br />There are some people who look at my life and think that I lead some charmed existence, but brothers and sisters, living a \\"real\\" life takes a lot of real work. The work does not necessarily have to be hard and burdensome, it can be a joyous experience releasing old demons, burning old \\"scripts\\", and letting go of beliefs that no longer serve you.<br /><br />This book is quite a read and it was the gateway for hundreds of other books along the same lines. People may complain, \\"Oh, he repeats himself over and over again...\\"<br /><br />Don't we all...don't we all?<br /><br />The journey into deeper understanding and self-knowledge is wondrous experience. I would rather hear a small tidbit of Truth over and over again rather than listening to the monkey garbage I used to endure...all of my own doing, of course...but Truth, real truth makes us high, makes us feel as though we could be, do, or have anything we want.<br /><br />Which by the way, we can...<br /><br />Empower yourself with this gorgeous book.

I would rather hear a small tidbit of Truth over and over again rather than listening to the monkey garbage I used to endure...all of my own doing, of course...but Truth, real truth makes us high, makes us feel as though we could be, do, or have anything we want.

B000001Y9I|5.0|For me this is one of those great albums I was never aware of till a couple of weeks ago.  Perhaps the small label on which it was recorded didn't market it...worse yet, I did not hear ONE song from this disc on any radio station near my market. I only found this disc because I surfed on Amazon...I sampled it and got excited. The 5 star rating I give \\"Purpendicular\\" is accurate....the other 50 or so  reviews that appear at the time of my entry reflect my feelings about this Purple outing... Come taste this band...again . Buy this cd with the bands current release \\"Rapture Of The Deep\\"...crank it up and be amazed by their musicianship, hooks, and sensibility...wow!...these guys make me proud to be a rocker!
B000068PQ0|3.0|I like the Flaming Lips but they are more of a visual spectacle (seen live) than a great \\"sounding\\" group. They are so out there, try so hard to be eccentric that it sometimes takes away from the quality of their music.<br /><br />Whereas Wilco takes simple melodic songs and then enhances them with their sonic applications, Flaming Lips' buzzes, spurts, and blips detract from otherwise good songs.<br /><br />They are certainly no novelty act b/c there is serious creativity. I just cannot listen to them for too long b/c the weirdness interferes with the music.<br /><br />\\"Flight Test\\" \\"Yoshimi Pt I\\" and \\"Do you Realize\\" are the best songs.<br /><br />On the day the best are seperated from the rest, The Flaming Lips will have an incredible compilation album.
B00005JP7Y|5.0|So, i had been waiting for awhile to see this movie and went and saw it with my best friend! We both loved it and had decided by halfway through the movie that we will be buying it as soon as the DVD comes out! The storyline is great and its a clean movie!! No complaints here! I just wish going to a theatre didnt cost so much so I could watch it several times while waiting for the DVD!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|this movie is great and christian bale is awesome, although some of the other reviews are giving away to many details which will ruin the suspense for you. its best to not know what to expect with this movie.
B000H5TH1Q|5.0|...with my parents.<br /><br />I'll never forget seeing this movie in the theaters with my parents. We happen to see the quite young daughter of a really good couple friend of my parents, right before we went into the theater to watch this. My parents had no idea how bad this one was. My mother, just out of the blue, invited the young lady to join us. Brian DePalma has always been one of my favorite directors, and I only had a slight hint of how bad/good this would be. Well, I don't need to tell you the rest of the story, if you've seen this movie. My parents apologized profusely to her parents, later after we watched it. AND I WAS LOVING IT!!!<br /><br />I bought this on laser disc right when it came out, and recently, about 1 year ago, bought the DVD. I really like the movie, one of my favorite Brian DePalma flicks. I'll tell you some of my favorite parts.<br /><br />1) The music playing, when Scully, the Craig Wasson character, gets excused from his movie scene, and is driving home to spend some unexpected quality time with his live in girlfriend. That is probably the greatest sound track music I've ever heard, by Pino Donaggio.<br /><br />2) The edit cuts, between the viewing of the murder, through the eyeglass, that Scully is looking through, and the real life view, in the living room of the murder victim. I still remember the sound effects and cries of pain by the actress.<br /><br />3) The twirling effect of the cameras, when Scully and the female are kissing no the beach (no, it didn't make me dizzy, like other reviewers.)<br /><br />4) The \\"B\\" Acting of Melanie Griffith. You' d think she really was a porn star, the way she's acting.<br /><br />5) The police detective that interviews Scully. That guy was so creepy. Reminds me of the actor Fred Gwynne. Very entertaining.<br /><br />Rent or buy this movie, and you shall not be disappointed.<br /><br />Little known fact about this movie: Brian DePalma interviewed a real porn star (can't think of her name off hand, but she was extremely popular at the time this movie was being made) and rejected her based on her poor acting skills. Too bad they don't include her trial tapes in the DVD extras That would be bangin'!!! There is a book I own, called Double DePalma, which gives in great details the behind the scenes of this movie. I just checked, and it is also available for as little as $2.11. I highly recommend that item too.<br /><br />Dubyac99 aka MC White said: Ch-ch-ch-check it out!!! EDIT: I'm the 69th reviewer of this version? Coincidence? I think not!<br /><br />EDIT: 10/27/2006<br />Well, I have finally received my copy of this DVD from Columbia House, and let me tell you, it was really great!  I would have liked some commentaries from Brian De Palma, but I notice he does not like to do commentaries, for the most part.<br /><br />Still, this movie is one of my all time favorites by him.<br /><br />Totally Excellent!!!ing made) and rejected her based on her poor acting skills.

B000HEYVD6|2.0|This is the first book I've read by Baldacci and it will probably be the last.  While the book overall may be good enough to pass the time on a rainy day, the plot and characters are constructed in such a sloppy manner it comes off as very amateurish.  The terrorist plot in this work requires so many things to happen just right that it simply blows any \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" out of the water.  The entire effort seems to be nothing more than a mechanism to serve up the author's political views in a convenient manner, even down to the fact that Baldacci's terrorists use only sedative-laced darts instead of bullets so as not to actually harm anyone.  (What exactly do Al Quaeda, Huzballah and other terrorist organizations have to do to convince the left that maybe, just maybe, they are dangerous?)  Anyway, there are an infinite number of better reads than this on the bookshelves; pass this one by unless you just love Baldacci.
B000001IQH|4.0|I'm not a big punkrock fan, I'm more into music thats a bit more intricate, but this album defintly rocks it. I'd pick this one up for any music fan, esp. a bass player cuz Matt Freeman just rips it, this is true for pretty much all the albums. But dont compare them to the Clash or the Ramones, Rancid is far better than that....
B000GRU6XS|5.0|After (and including) Fear of the Dark, Iron Maiden went through something of a mid-life crisis. The Blaze Bayley era had precious few truly good songs (The Clansmen and Sign of the Cross come to mind), and the last two albums, especially the penultimate Dance of Death, while containing some undeniably great moments, showed the 'classic' line-up at their most ambivalent. Now, happily, Iron Maiden are in top form, releasing an album more grandiose than Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, melodically equal or even superior to their self-titled album, and with an incessantly motive heaviness--a heaviness only emphasised by the acutely and thoughtfully measured sound production.<br /><br />Each song, as with all great Maiden songs, becomes more enjoyable with repeated listenings. That cannonade of drum rolls that you missed, or that foregounding of Harris's galloping bassline, or a momentary harmony between the three guitars--whatever detail it may be, each song is masterfully layered.<br /><br />A previous reviewer made the comment that this could not be Iron Maiden's best or even one of their best albums, not because the music is inferior, but because of their age. Something as extrinsic as their age only has a bearing on the quality of the album if it adversely affects the music. In 'A Matter of Life and Death' it certainly does not; were I given all of Iron Maiden's albums blind, I would put this in the same era as Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Bruce Dickinson's voice is as strong as it ever was (though I do agree with yet another above reviewer that his voice could utilise the lower registers a bit more for some relief by contrast); the three guitarists are playing the best they've ever played; Harris's bass is perfectly integrated--and played. Special mention, however, must go to Nicko McBrain's drumwork: it is by far his best and most sophisticated yet.<br /><br />On previous albums, war has been a common theme--equally common has been its somewhat naive and belligerent depiction. In 'A Matter of Life and Death' the writing has matured, and a cynicism about war, a concern for its human effects, and the role that religion plays take salience. I would hesistate in calling it particularly new or sophisticated, but there is certainly here a noble message.<br /><br />Now I will give the obligatory track-by-track run-down:<br /><br />The opener, 'Different World', is the weakest track on the album--on almost any other album by almost any other band, however, it would almost certainly be a flagship. Fast, cannonading, and with a strong riff, it is a good, if rather standard, opener.<br /><br />The second track, 'These Colours Don't Run'--while being a reference to Sharon Osbourne's egg-attack on the band some years ago--starts with a classic Maiden build-up, from singular guitar melody to the simultaneous introduction of Bruce's operatic vocals and the rhythm section. While a good song, this is still rather pedestrian for Maiden.<br /><br />Number three is the already famous 'Brighter than a Thousand Suns', which purports to present the details of a nuclear detonation. The guitars and the back-up vocals are put to fantastic use here, especially the rhythm guitar. The images are vivid--unusually vivid for Iron Maiden, whose lyrics usually tip into self-parody (though precious few listen to Maiden for the quality of the lyrics).<br /><br />Next up is one of my favourites: 'The Pilgrim'. The drum and guitar dominant introduction is reminiscent of a Slavic dance--incredibly melodic and punctuated with powerful drum work. It is similar in tone to 'Mother Russia'. McBrain distinguishes himself here.<br /><br />As Harris does in the next track, 'The Longest Day', with a downplayed and galloping bass complementing, but not overbearing or being overborne by, a distant and resonant guitar. Bruce lets loose on the vocals here--soaring and, I'll say it again, melodic.<br /><br />The next track, 'Out of the Shadows', reminds me (perhaps unjustifiedly) of 'Strange World' from their self-titled release. Beautifully done.<br /><br />And then there's 'The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg'. None of the tracks so far I would call classic, but this one will last--and if it doesn't, it is an indictment of modern muscial taste rather than of the quality of the track. A long, melodious, and rather haunting opening; the lyrics are now foregrounded, as they are first and foremost telling a story rather than being subservient complements to a riff or grind; and then something extraordinary happens: the neck of one of the guitars is almost flayed of its strings as the song falls into its most heavy section. Bruce's vocals here are in a lower register (though still rather high, as they are wont to be), which is refreshing. Fantastic song, and one I cannot recomment highly enough.<br /><br />As is the next one--it is perhaps even superior, I can't quite decide. 'For the Greater Good of God' has a classic Harris opening--a full and emotive bassline. My review is becoming longwinded so I'll truncate it from here on. The song is (arguably) the most epic on the album, with some fantastic guitar work--the three men complement each other perfectly. Retaining Janick Gers was a great idea, it seems.<br /><br />The final two tracks, 'Lord of Light' and 'The Legacy' maintain the quality of the album so far--the latter imbibed with a deathly and unsettling tone; the former being a classicly elevated hard-rocker.<br /><br />Though some of the tracks are slightly overlong ('For the Greater Good of God' and 'The Legacy' could have a minute shaved off each) it is hardly to the detriment of the album. 'A Matter of Life and Death' is equal to Maiden's very best and, given time, may even supersede their 'Golden Years' efforts, rendering the former years quite silver and the following gold. How unusual it is for a band, after almost three decades, to release one of their best albums. It gives me hopes for Metallica's redemption--though not that much hope.perhaps unjustifiedly) of 'Strange World' from their self-titled release.

B00005JOVH|2.0|The first X-Men move was good, the second very good, and I eagerly looked forward to the third.<br /><br />Regretfully, I was disappointed.<br /><br />The themes from the first two - Wolverine's trying to discover his past and the growing anti-mutant  movement - were ignored.  Instead, we had the \\"mutant cure\\" plot which, in effect, makes the whole mutant problem pass&eacute;.  A person no longer has to learn to live with his or her mutant powers, simply get a shot and it's all gone.<br /><br />I noticed flaws in the story as well.  In one instance, several mutants are being transported to prison, right?  The guards carry guns that fire darts loaded with the cure, right?  Why, pray tell, hasn't someone already injected the mutants with the cure to neutralize their powers?  In another instance, when Magneto moves the Golden Gate bridge it is daytime.  When his army starts marching over it is daytime.  But then, surprise of surprises, when they reach the end of the bridge, it is nighttime.  What happened?<br /><br />The X-Men movie series can still be salvaged.  A plot twist can be introduced in another movie that would make the cure temporary, something that would wear off after a while, similar to what Stryker did in X-Men 2.  Aside from that, it would be best to shelve any future X-Men projects.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing, guys.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|the oscar winning documentary studies the career of robert strange mcnamara, savior of ford motor company, architect of the viet nam war, patron saint of the golbalization economy, self-justifier par excellence, and (imho) one of the greatest villains of the 20th century.  (ok, hes not on a level with stalin or hitler or walter o'malley, but hes close).  the film manages to remain even handed about its subject, something i would never be able to do, and on that level it should be appreciated.  i think his fans will come away seeing him as a tragically flawed hero, and his detractors (like me) will come away seeing him as the vile [...] he is.  the movie demands that you think, and for that alone it should be seen by any person interested in americas role in the world.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|\\"Remember, remember the 5th of November, <br />The Gunpowder Treason and Plot. <br />I know of no reason the Gunpowder Treason <br />Should ever be forgot.\\" <br /> <br />Comic book geeks on both sides of the Atlantic during the '80s feel chills when we hear that snippet of poetry dedicated to Guy Fawkes.  It's quoted in the beginning of Alan Moore's second seminal comic work, \\"V For Vendetta.\\"  For some reason, the book never seemed to get the dues it deserved, probably because it was ahead of its time when first published serially in \\"Warrior\\" (U.K.) magazine.  We who lived through those times, even as young people, remember in the U.S. and U.K. there was a feeling of super-patriotism and populism that many of us felt would lead to a new fascism.  Nowadays, those fears ring true again. <br /> <br />Purists should take note - especially if you're as (justifiably) persnickety as Alan Moore - that the film takes some liberties with the graphic novel's story.  It's been updated to reflect the new fascist fears of today, as well as the power of television and internet.  Moore was so incensed at the changes made by the Warchowsky Brothers that he fought a successful legal battle to have his credit removed from the movie.  I think I can understand why, as I've seen how Hollywood took his \\"Swamp Thing\\" and \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" and completely warped it from his original intent.  However, I think he would be secretly pleased at how much of the spirit of his story is maintained. <br /> <br />The themes of \\"V\\" are timeless - the use of fear to control and dominate, the willingness of the masses to turn a blind eye to persecuting the \\"different\\" in order to keep their feeling of security - and McTeague keeps this overall sense of menace and fear by showing us the new Hitler/Stalin, David Sutler (Susan in the graphic novel) mostly on television, just like everyone in that world sees him.  The stark symbolism of the double-bar cross used by the fascist Norsefire Party that brings together the twin tyrannies of repressive State and Organized Religion.  The messages of the film are clear, and well presented. <br /> <br />Is it perfect?  No.  Sometimes the pacing lags, and there are sharp changes of mood, such as the parody of Sutler on a chat show set to the tune of what I call the \\"Benny Hill Rag\\" (those who've watched the Benny Hill Show know what I'm talking about).  Yet the strengths draw you in; the previously mentioned moodiness and feeling of paranoic fear, the superb acting of Natalie Portmann (bonus for maintaining her accent), Stephen Rea, John Hurt, Hugo Weaving (even though it isn't him under the mask most of the time), et. al., and the lush attention to detail in cinematography, as well as stage design.  It all drags you in. <br /> <br />There aren't too many action movies out there that also demand that you think and try to draw conclusions.  It's all too easy to end up drowning in metaphor and lectures (which is what happened to the latter two \\"Matrix\\" outings), yet \\"V\\" in film form maintains that balance.  We are entertained after all, and called upon to think where we are heading as a people.
B000FFJYCU|4.0|this is a fascinating peek into a time that was ending just as the movie was made.  im not a fan of auto racing, ive never been able to understand the appeal or the strategy involved, but after watching this film (and the terrific supplementary documentaries found on disc 2 of the dvd) i can appreciate better the love some feel for the sport.  as a movie, its your run of the mill soaper, featuring good performances by the always reliable james garner, yves montand, &c. -- but nobody who watches this movie is watching it for plot or character nuances.  and oh how i wish i had seen this 40 years back on a big screen! <br />
0446691437|5.0|. . . .unless you consider Tuesdays with Morrie a book on how to die. Steven Pressfield<br />(The Legend of Bagger Vance, The Afghan Campaign) writes in the hammer-fisted prose of the accomplished novelist, delivering body-blow after body-blow against your rope-a-dope of lame excuses for not getting down to business and writing that book that has been in the back of your mind since college.<br /> The War of Art, which he blasted out in a scant two months, is divided into three parts, not unlike Gaul in ancient Rome. What would you expect from a writer of classical war novels?  Part one begins autobiographically as Pressfield explains his daily writing procedure; a series of rituals -including praying to the muses- that leads him up to the actual \\"plunging in\\". The rituals are designed to summon the proper mindset with the sole intent of, for one more day, defeating what he calls resistance. Resistance is an ephemeral force that is real as air, as powerful as a tornado, and as furtive as a fart. It disguises itself as fear, self-doubt, interference from others, and perhaps its most insidious form, procrastination.<br /> Pressfield points out that there is only one way to overcome resistance, and that is action. If you're a frustrated Hemingway, get writing. Get to work. The same goes for those who are frustrated Beethovens, DaVinci's and Donald Trumps; even Ghandis.<br />Book two lays out what it means to be a pro vs. a dilettante, which basically entails putting on the boots, picking up the rifle, and slogging through the mud and undergrowth every day in spite of rain snow, sleet or needy significant others until you have reached the objective-and then immediately striking out anew. Visions come to mind of the dog-faces in Vietnam sacrificing blood and guts to capture a hill, only to abandon it and then be forced to re-capture it again, or perhaps Sisyphus pushing the boulder up the hill. This is the lot of the artist: to sacrifice himself for his art. It's not a pretty picture, but neither is going to your grave with that science fiction trilogy about a galaxy far, far away still stuck inside your head.<br />Book three details the magic that happens when you finally dig in, pick up the pen, the brush, or the business plan and get to work. Those of us who have experienced the visitation of the muses; laying out word after word on paper with no idea where it is coming from, or how long it will go on, have felt the addictive exhilaration of their embrace.

B00000G3AZ|2.0|this is the poorest of the plethora of jane austen adaptations we have undergone the past decade, with gwyneth paltrow stumbling her way through an unfunny retelling of austens classic.  fortunately its been 3 weeks since i watched this and ive managed to put the details of WHY i found it distasteful into the nether regions of my mind, but it was a mess. <br />
B000F1IQN2|2.0|Two things strike me as odd as I look through the other customer reviews of 'Munich' on this site; the star ratings are much higher than I expected and few discuss the film itself - only the historical background. I think this is a classic case of can't-seperate-movie-from-sensitive-history syndrome which is a shame because the film is truly awful. The plot is confused and hard to follow (the use of flashbacks makes no sense), there is no pace or intrigue and it is far too long. Worst of all, Spielberg wasted some fine acting talent (Ciaran Hinds, Daniel Craig, Geoffrey Rush et al) on a script that is impossible to understand.  <br />I think Spielberg's mistake was to follow the book too closely. There are too many unrelated scenes and the movie format (even at 2h 40m) doesn't allow for all the supporting information you need to make sense of them. Characters appear and disappear, locations change but the sets seemingly don't. The only scene that was exciting to watch was the one in which the assassins were thwarted by a removals van and an innocent young girl - but this was one short scene among several dozen. <br /> <br />If you're being honest with yourself you can't award this film more than two stars, however interesting the book and real history are.   <br />
B000E97Y6K|2.0|after the triumph of \\"lord of the rings\\", peter jackson deserves a pass.  well, this was it.  he desparately needed a script editor, in that the opening 45 minutes of exposition should have been pared down to 15 at most.  the technological \\"advances\\" since the real film only serve to point up the inadequacy of cgi: the creatures' look belongs to neither the world of reality nor fantasy, just some pathetic hybrid.  add to that the stiff performances of naomi watts and adrien brody (both of whom we know can do better), the amateurish emoting of a miscast jack black, and the superfluous storyline involving the always stunning jamie bell (if kong had ANY common sense, he wouldve opted for him over naomi) which merely gets dropped midstream without any resolution, and we have a gargantuan mess.  i will certainly be eager to see jacksons next movie, but after this -- well, he better do good. <br />

Stephen King provides insight and advice on writing, plus he includes a personal history of his childhood which helped shape the stories he tells.  He also includes a chapter about a horrific experience that he had while walking near his home in Bangor, Maine.  During that walk, an old man driving a van ran into him crushing the lower half of his body.  It took months of recovery time and many surgeries before he was able to start functioning and writing again.

B000H7JD4A|5.0|To me, A Matter of Life and Death is actually X-Factor, Pt2. Songs are unusually arranged and take longer to get into, and the lyrics are mostly about religion and war. Maiden have included progressive elements before, but on this one they completely embraced the style. Think old-school King Crimson, Jethro Tull, and Genesis, with the Maiden sound circa Somewhere in Time and the gloom of X-Factor!  <br />People who say that Iron Maiden stagnate and play the same music over again are definitely going to bite their tongue this time. The album has the usual Maiden feel to it: grandiose rhythm and melody work, and over-the-top vocals. The lyrics are of lesser quality than what Iron Maiden got us accustomed to before, and the guitar solos don't really stick out, but that's only minor.  <br /> <br />One of the problems I have with the album is that it wanders a bit at times. You could cut ten minutes from it and it would sound tighter and more fresh, just like their golden era albums did. For example, the intro and instrumental part at the end of Out of the Shadows are both unnecessary in my opinion. While some intros and outros are pure concentrated genius (The Legacy and Longest Day), some others are just out of place. Also, the production of the album isn't exactly stellar. There are spots here and there that are quieter than they need to be, and sometimes you can hear bleed-through from microphones in the studio. Best production to date is Brave New World, and I don't know why it changed.   <br /> <br />I didn't think I would say this but A Matter of Life and Death trumped any expectations I had. Brave New World was an instant masterpiece, Dance of Death was a worthy follower, but this one is the beginning of a new era, with a new sound. Although it has its minor flaws, it's a really great album overall. I'm glad to hear Maiden are still alive and kicking hard! <br /> <br />Standout tracks: Brighter than a Thousand Suns, The Pilgrim, For the Greater Good of God, Longest Day  <br /> <br />Honorary Mention: The Legacy (thank you Janick!)

Won't go into more detail in case you want to watch it. <br /> <br />Sounds like sterotypical horror fare, but this has more blood, cruelty and gore than most.  <br /> <br />I really like this movie not because it created a real atmosphere of tension and suspense and horror - what a horror movie is meant to do. <br /> <br />It also has a flavour of Tarantino in it, too, which is always good. <br /> <br />Watching the DVD extras on the making of the movie were great, too, really funny. <br /> <br />Better than Saw or Saw II, and would probably appeal to the same audience. <br />
B00005JM02|4.0|the best (by far) of the pixar movies; this one manages to make the technology subservient to the story.  i genuinely laughed and was (mildly) touched, so i like it.  and i have nothing to add. <br />
B000CPH9I4|5.0|I just don't get how anybody could not love this album!  It is pure bliss.
0792164903|2.0|I had pretty high expectations when I popped this in the DVD player.  After about 20 minutes those expectations turned into prayers..... prayers for something good to save this movie but it never happened.  The first scenes were OK and there was some intrigue, but it quickly got dull and just plodded along not knowing what to do next. <br /> <br />Ichabod Crane isnt sure what his plan is, he just wanders from place to place without much direction.  Depp played the character well, I just didnt like the character!  Christina Riccis character seemed totally disinterested with what was going on. It might have been Ms. Ricci since I consider her a pretty low-grade actress.  The rest of the cast was OK but noone jumped out as special or well-thought out. <br /> <br />This *might* be worth a rental if you're desperate but I really do NOT recommend this film.  Those that like it must be fans of Depp or Ricci.  The many high reviews puzzle me...???
B000FIMG68|5.0|Review: I have been a religious viewer of LOST ever since the pilot episode hooked me in. The show is the most intelligent and emotionally captivating show to ever grace television. No other drama has the same emotional weight as LOST. Season 1 was absolutely amazing and each episode was crafted so carefully and so beautifully.<br /><br />Season 2 was less about the characters and more about the situation they are in on the island, the central plot. We learn that on the island there is a research facility of some kind called the Dharma Initiative that is run by The Hanso Foundation. We discover that the so called \\"Others\\" are the passengers of the tail-end of the plane. We also learn that there is so much more to the island than we think we know. We know there are several other stations like The Swan, and as we think that the survivors are nothing but a research experiment. We learn even further that the researchers are part of the experiment. Inside the hatch, a clock countdowns from 108 minutes, and every 108 minutes the code has to be input into the computer. The code is 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, and they are all numbers that play a significance in the plot. One thing to notice is that all the numbers add up to 108, but that is only one of the many puzzle pieces that the show offers the audience to put together.<br /><br />Another aspect of the show are the social themes that are presented within the storylines. The first episode is called \\"Man of Science, Man of Faith\\" and basically is a good sum up of the juxtaposing viewpoints. We have Jack, the doctor, a man who believes that everything has an explanation and that nothing is left up to coincidence and fate. Locke believes that he is here on the island as part of his destiny, a man who was paralyzed from the waist down now can walk. He thinks the island has supernatural powers and is guiding the survivors to a certain destiny, he also believes everything happens for a reason. Mr. Eko, who is new this season, is a man of religion, a man who believes that divine intervention is guiding them on the island. The storylines support all these viewpoints so it never leans toward one opinion versus another. We also have the continuing theme of existentialism as these survivors start with their new lives and new futures, and forget about their past. The crash can be seen as a rebirth for the survivors and now each of them are finding their path on this mysterious island. We also see a social commentary within the interaction of the group. Tensions build and the group starts to fall apart from within and certain people start going behind other people's backs.<br /><br />The reason why LOST is so amazing is that it holds so many cinematic qualities. The directing, the acting, the editing, the cinematography, and the music is all excellent. Michael Giacchino's score for the show is absolutely stunning and amazing, the best score for a television series ever. Each episode feels like a short film in its own, and even though each episode has a culmination at the end, it always leaves a breathtaking cliffhanger that makes your heart pace as the signature wailing trumpets come and we cut to black. LOST has characters that we all can relate to, and the emotion is incredibly real, which is why LOST is such a big success.<br /><br />Many people criticized the show for having a second season slump. While there were two or three episodes that felt like they ran around in circles, it was in no way a slump. There was lots of controversy about this year's Emmy nominations when LOST basically got shut out. Last year they took home both the Emmy and the Golden Globe for best television drama. This season did present new questions, but many were answered as well. The show was just as strong as its first season, and it gave us plenty of progression. We learned more about the characters and their pasts, we learned a lot about The Dharma Initiative and what it truly is, we learned that there are \\"others\\" on this island but we don't know their motives, and we learn that there is a supernatural presence as well in the \\"black smoke\\" a.k.a. the security system. LOST season 2 is a great continuation on an amazing series.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Image & Sound: As I said earlier, LOST is very cinematic in its structure and in its overall nature. So, the technical aspects are as good as any film on DVD and are on par with last season's release. All 24 episodes are presented in glorious 1.78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen. Picture quality is stunning with amazingly sharp picture. The 24 episodes are spread over 6 discs with the seventh disc reserved for bonus features. The bright colors of the island are sharply presented and the black levels are handled perfectly during the night scenes. The transfer is really good for a TV show. The sound mix is an immersive Dolby Digital 5.1 track as well as a 2.0 track (but who needs that?). The show comes alive in 5.1 and sound plays a big role in the show. The surround speakers are utilized and the mix is overall excellent.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Special Features: LOST fans know that the previous set had amazing special features. Season 2 continues that with a smorgasbord of special features. The features this time around are a little less about the making of the show and more about the plot of the show and the connections you can make with the clues. Don't get me wrong, there is a great deal of \\"behind the scenes\\" too. We also have 4 select commentaries on 4 great episodes. Best Buy is offering an exclusive bonus disc with the package that has a few more \\"making of\\" featurettes for certain episodes.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Final Words: LOST is the best show on television, that's all there is to it. It's an amazingly real human drama, an incredible adventure show, and it has plenty of mysteries that need to be uncovered. It's a television experience that is one of a kind and is not to be missed. LOST fanatics will study these episodes in hope of catching new clues they missed the first time around, and it's always good to review before the new season.

B000G73U5Y|4.0|Allow me to wax philosophic for a bit before I get to the hard-copy details.<br /><br />Music in the 60's lived in the present, but sometimes spoke to the future.  In the 80's it may have been \\"Dawn in America\\", but in rock n' roll it was 2 AM and there was a drunk, naked groupie on the couch.  Music of the 70's may be unique in the way that it is so much about the past.<br /><br />Steely Dan, in both mood and lyrical content, is a band about the past.  Not just in the nostalgic sense, as any music of a bygone decade might stimulate that feeling.  Steely Dan's music was about the past even when it was being made in the present.<br /><br />It is often about regrets and missed opportunities, but it indulges itself in regret as an experience and a mood.  It does this not in the ridiculous self-pitying manner of the 90's, but rather from the viewpoint of people who still feel that they're in the game and have plenty of time to bounce back.  It's the music of the recently-young speaking to the presently-young.  It's the music of twenty-somethings, who don't really think of themselves as \\"old\\", but find that a decade has made a difference while they weren't watching.<br /><br />Now, nuts-n-bolts time.  There is no single Steely Dan collection, save it be the 4-disc set, that can claim to have *every* track that any fan would want.  This collection is as good as any.  You can complain, if you like, about the absence of \\"Josie\\", but that track is also absent from the most popular one-disc collection up until now, \\"A Decade of Steely Dan\\".  This collection features one of their most popular songs, \\"Dirty Work\\", which was absent from that previous collection.  No one-disc collection has both, and if you can't live without it then you can just BUY a copy of \\"Aja\\" (the album featuring \\"Josie\\") for a mere 8 bucks on Amazon.<br /><br />This album has the tracks arranged in chronological order, with tracks from the same album grouped together and ordered by release date.  This allows you to hear the progression from early songs like \\"Dirty Work\\" to later songs like \\"Babylon Sisters\\".  That \\"Hey Nineteen\\" comes at the end of their productive years whereas \\"Reelin' in the Years\\" kicks it off, I feel my concept of the band being about the ways we relate to the past as we age is illustrated quite well.<br /><br />Apart from such conceptual pretensions, the chronological order also shows the direction of the band musically.  Early hits like \\"Dirty Work\\", while they possessed a mellow-jazz sound in many ways similar to their later hits, were not all that distinct in their sound from Procul Harum's \\"Whiter Shade of Pale\\".  This album takes you through the entire decade to show how the sound evolved.  It is smooth, polished 70's jazz-rock all the way through, guaranteed to please.<br /><br />The two very recent tracks are, in my opinion, somewhat ho-hum.  The Grammy Award for \\"Two Against Nature\\" was probably a poorly-disguised \\"Career Achievement Award\\".  The tracks from that album featured on this disc are decent, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />In a nutshell, there's little reason to prefer either this album or \\"Decade\\" over the other.  I like the chronological order of this collection, but I won't say this is necessarily superiour to the song order of \\"Decade\\" which is bookended with the tracks \\"FM\\" and \\"Bad Sneakers\\" that definitely *sound* like an opener and a closer.  Either collection is a solid choice for the fan who just wants to experience the music and who doesn't care to invest in the 4-disc set.e.

B000H7JD4K|5.0|I think I blame superficial guys who gave this a bad review, because they didnt even give it a fair listen and didnt even spent any time on listening to it over and over.<br /><br />This album Rocks and the music and the lyrics combine to give an idea and an Iron Maiden style together..<br /><br />UP THE IRONS!!
B000009RC2|5.0|J.R. I'm sorry but you don't know what you are talking about. Probably because you never saw this band live. This music is a lot easier to pick up on when seen live, but once you grasp it it's special. <br /> <br />I've seen most of the people you mention as being better composers. Sorry. NOPE! NO WAY! NADA! I've seen acts that were this good but never seen one that was better or more impressive in ANY way. And I've seen my share of composers. Zappa, Mingus, Miles, Sun Ra, Terry Riley, Steve Reich. This stuff stands up quite well to time. <br /> <br />The compositions may not be on the level of Beethoven or Miles Davis (wrong about him too) but they broke ground, and they continue to be a bar that few bands, or composers, reach. This band at it's heights was spectacular, no, unbelievable. The metric stuff alone cracked open the world of music. Of course it's partially improvised so it's a group compositional effort. It remains raw which is way better than 99% of the polished stuff that followed. It's harder to listen to than a lot of jazz rock but it's well worth the effort. Most fusion or jazz rock is actually pretty lame, not this. <br /> <br />In fact some of the \\"composers\\" you mention, I don't want to name names because these are all fine musicians, but some of them have put out some awful, lightweight elevator music in terms of composition.  <br /> <br />Some of the later Mahavishnu albums are not that great and I will agree that McLaughlin tends towards virtuosity rather than composition, but you've got it wrong on this one and Birds of Fire. THESE two are definitely NOT elevator music and BOTH deserve more than 5 stars compared to some of the crap that gets 5 stars. I would call them inspired nearly devine. <br /> <br />However if you are a conservative listener... go for what J.R. recommended.
B000GPIPVU|3.0|Of the many, many songs available for his sophomore release, LaMontagne didn't choose his strongest - or set them for the maximum \\"bang\\" - in my opinion. I'm sure there was a method and a reason why he chose what he did, and that's his prerogative. Maybe I'm jaded having seen most of them live - simple and powerful, standing on their own without all the padding - but at any rate, I'm a little disappointed. <br /> <br />The arrangement of Can I Stay reminds me of something I'd hear in the background of a \\"Lifetime Women's Network\\" movie -  sappy. It would have been so much better, so much more personal were it just Ray and his guitar, as he does it live.  <br /> <br />And the horns on Three More Days just sound cheezy.  <br /> <br />I am pleased with the title track & Lesson Learned. You Can Bring Me Flowers is funky but again, the horns are cheezy.  <br /> <br />New tunes Barfly, Be Here Now and Truly, Madly, Deeply are \\"perfectly Ray\\", though. <br />
B00005JNS0|5.0|There is a reviewer on here who says this movie is not good for younger kids. I disagree.  It really depends on your child's interests. My son was three when this movie first came out.  He had never watched a movie all the way through before, and is usually bored by videos/movies.  This is the first movie that he has shown any interest in seeing.  Long before it came out he was fascinated by the pictures of cars with faces and we took him to see the movie months ago (his first movie theatre experience) and there has not been a day since that he doesn't talk about Cars.  He knows all the characters, remembers the whole plot (we only saw it once), and now he compares the types of cars in the movie with the ones he sees on the road.  I thought I wouldn't like the movie because I am totally uninterested in cars, but I thought it was really well done.  The characterizations are fun and the animation is superb.  Only Pixar could come up with such a creative, engaging movie about cars.  My husband LOVED it and is looking forward to the DVD release as much as my four-year-old, who keeps asking for it for Christmas.  I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and admire Pixar even more after seeing it.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I can't believe that the Red Hot Chili Peppers can put out an Album like this - I am blown away. I took my time before writing a review, listening through both CDs plenty of times in order to separate the instant gratification kind of songs from others which one may have to grow into. I can now say with confidence: This album is brilliant, without reservations. <br /> <br />The album is slower than previous albums. There was always some degree of conflict - or contrast - between the funky, fast songs and the slow, ballad-like songs on Californication and also on By the Way. Not so on Stadium Arcadium. There is no conflict, it's slower, wiser, older, and.. more beautiful.  <br /> <br />The songs are not extra slow, but they all fit together perfectly. The band has grown up and is at peace with itself, it has nothing left to prove, and from this position of calm seems to come the most amazing, mesmerizing music.  <br /> <br />This Album is a gift to mankind. I would give it 6 stars if I could.  <br /> <br />RHCP are the masters of re-invention. This is not a good album by a famous and brilliant band - this album is brillant all on its own. It's pure genius.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|The first and only time I heard Ray LaMontagne sing before I bought his two recordings was on Amazon. I clicked on the little clips you can hear and was hooked, ordered them both and watched the mail faithfully until they showed up. Beautiful voice, beautiful messages.
015670160X|5.0|What is perhaps most telling about Virginia Woolf's book Orlando is the way it forces the reader to take stock of what society tells us our lives are supposed to be like. There are certain societal norms, accepted lifestyles and beliefs, and when the individual steps outside of those norms, he or she is treated differently. Based on Orlando's identity, the society she lives in expects specific behaviors from her in the areas of business, society, and love, \\"that each man and each woman has another allotted to it for life.\\" Her search for meaning amidst those expectations is what ends up being Orlando's pursuit for meaning in life.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens
B00011RPB0|5.0|Everyone with whom I've ever discussed Lost In Translation has either loved or hated it. This is not a movie you can take lightly, one way or the other. To figure out if you'll enjoy this film, ask yourself the following questions: <br /> <br />1. Do you like Bill Murray as an actor? <br /> <br />2. Do you like Scarlett Johansson as an actress? <br /> <br />3. Do you like chick flicks? <br /> <br />4. Do you have a high tolerance - even a liking - for movies that are character driven instead of plot driven, i.e. the movie consists primarily of a series of neat character bits with very little forward momentum to the plot? <br /> <br />If, like me, you can answer yes to all of the above, you'll probably love this movie. If you answered no to any of them, probably not. <br /> <br />Bill Murray is Bob Harris, middle-aged movie actor and former star of a Seventies private eye TV show. Bob is in Japan, where his show is still amazingly popular, to film a whiskey commercial. Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte, in her early 20s. Charlotte is in Japan accompanying a neglectful photographer husband more interested in partying with the beautiful people than spending any time at all with his wife. (And does this man not have eyes? You want \\"beautiful people\\"? Does he not realize his wife looks exactly like Scarlett Johansson?) <br /> <br />Bob and Charlotte find themselves guests in the same impersonal hotel, isolated in a country where neither speak the language, both in unfulfilling marriages that, from what we see and hear on-screen, just might not be lasting too terribly much longer. And yet they both take their marriage vows seriously. This is the story of how two people, with absolutely no sexuality at all, still fall deeply, mutually in love, and how they deal with that. <br /> <br />Some people feel the end of Lost In Translation is a total copout. If you like your movies tied up in little bows with everything explained, all the Is dotted and Ts crossed, you're going to hate how this film ends. Personally, I thought the ending was absolutely brilliant - audaciously so. See if you agree.
0375703861|5.0|Zadie Smith has filled WHITE TEETH with cultural tension that drips from every relationship. Samad worries that his sons are being corrupted like all the other children in England. Alsana does not ever want to go back to India because she feels her family is safe in England. But Samad would not agree that \\"safe\\" is as clear as Alsana thinks it is. The minds, traditions, rituals, and morality of his sons are being eroded and destroyed. His sons are not safe. To him, Alsana is only \\"thankful [they] are in England . . . because [she] has swallowed it whole,\\" believing the lie of safety that promises physical security while your cultural foundation is eaten away beneath you.<br /><br />The question is, like Archie asks Samad on multiple occasions, \\"What kind of a world do [you] want your children to grow up in?\\" It is ironic that, much the same way Alsana is blinded by the actual world in which she lives, Samad believes that the world that is corrupting the morality of his sons is England itself. What he fails to recognize is that his moral failures - his affair with his son's teacher, his personal failure with what Poppy Burt-Jones calls his \\"incredible act of self-control,\\" . . . his \\"sense of sacrifice,\\" . . . and his abstinence and self-restraint - are the real source of his sons' moral failings.<br /><br />The difference is that Alsana is not worried about the truth within herself or the people she loves. She is more concerned with, as she tells Neena, \\"the truth that can be lived with.\\" She is tired of the tangled roots of their past and wants to struggle with today's problems, not worrying about or regretting over what lies in their yesterdays. She wants Samad to do the same, to remove his leg from out of the past and root it firmly in the present. What she fails to realize is what areas of Samad's have made the adjustment. His cultural roots may still lie with India, but much of his emotion and mental fantasy has grounded itself in his English present.<br /><br />All of this familial frustration happens within an England that is struggling with the same interracial problems as their family. The country's battle between their nostalgic whitewashed past and their multi-ethnic present and future is at the center of the novel as well, not just in London but in its former colonies that are still trying to find their post-colonial identities.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jonathan Stephensfrustration happens within an England that is struggling with the same interracial problems as their family.

0876852630|5.0|Most people will not be able understand Bukowski.  They will read the funny stories, think he's a masochist and a drunk and leave it at that.  But what can be discovered here is our generation's greatest writer.  Factotum is not the best of his books if read first but is an amazing addition to understanding the development of his writing and his insights into our society.  It's a part of his live that can't be missed.  All of Bukowski's work is autobiographical.  His alter ego is Hank Chinaski and all his books cover a period of his life.  I suggest you read Post Office first, and then read Women.  These are the periods when his character is fully formed and you can get completely taken by his stories and his odd live.  Post Office covers the time when he works at the post office and drinks and writes all night and women covers the time when he was starting to get some publicity for his work.  You'll understand these periods better later on but they are the most amusing books and a good start to get you into his writing. Then read ham on rye and follow it with Factotum. Ham on Rye tells the tale of his childhood. Its the book that opens your eyes to why he behaved/wrote the way he did and you soon start to see the tragedy of his life.  You'll understand the human suffering he went through and how it enabled him to experience life differently and thus write with more honesty and insight then anyone has before.  And you start to understand how human the previous books really were and he becomes a true inspiration for contemplation of our post modern existence.  Then read Factotum which shows the young, still ambitious, still rejected man who still has a hint of hope.  You see the Bukowski that had the freedom to roam around and had more of that young man's foolish heart.  Before he was really broken and tried to live a normal life by working at the post office.  And you have arrived full circle!!!  I know this commentary doesn't tell you much about what you'll discover but it's better if you arrive there on your own.  Once you've read a few of his books - rent the bukowski documentary!   One word of caution: Reading and understanding Bukowski will change your live. Change the way you look at society and the world around you.  And you'll have a blast along the way.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|This album is incredible when measured against everything else that's being recorded now.  It has both an archaic feel in its sound - as if long lost songs had just been found - but the lyrics have profound meaning for the world today.  If it wasn't so new, it would be prophecy.  \\"Workingman's Blues #2\\" is honestly one of the finest things that Dylan has ever recorded, proving he's as relevant as ever.<br /><br />That being said, it's not \\"Highway 61\\" or \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" and it isn't trying to be.  It is a great addition to an illustrious career, and it has moments of remarkable beauty, intensity, and wisdom.  It has moments of protest (\\"they say low wages are reality, if we want to compete abroad\\"), foreboding, happiness (\\"when I'm with you, I forget I was ever blue\\") and depression (\\"the world has gone black before my eyes.\\")  It has some incredible one-liners (\\"Some people have barely enough skin to cover the bone.\\"  \\"I'm raising an Army, some tough sons of bitches, I'm recruiting my Army from the orphanages.\\") It masterfully blends these competing, contrasting, and contributing themes with elements of country, blues, jazz, swing, folk, and rock.<br /><br />If you buy one album this year, it should be this one.

B00005JP81|4.0|\\"Half Nelson\\" is probably not a film you have heard of. And that's a shame. An independent film starring Ryan Gosling (\\"The Notebook\\", \\"Murder By Numbers\\"), released by a very small independent company, it will be difficult for most to find this film, but it is well worth the effort to search for it. I first heard of it while watching `Ebert & Roeper'; Roeper and his guest host, filmmaker Kevin Smith just couldn't stop raving about it. This is the best thing about `Ebert & Roeper'; they draw attention to worthy, small, independent films, giving them an audience they may never have received. Hopefully, I will be able to spread the word a little as well, and help this film find an audience.<br /><br />Dan Dunne (Gosling), a junior high history teacher at an inner city New York school, seems to be connecting with the majority of his students, teaching them about the history of their country, urging them to come up with ideas and not simply regurgitate facts and dates. He is also the coach of the losing basketball team, but holds out hope. Returning to his apartment, his drug habit calls and he smokes some crack. The drug habit relegates him to a life of squalor in a dumpy apartment, with creditors calling him on the phone. The drugs allow him to escape and give him an excuse to not connect with his friends, maintain relationships, or to work on his children's book. One night, after a basketball game, Dan steals away to the girl's bathroom for a fix and one of his students, Drey (Shareeka Epps) walks in and discovers him. He's in bad shape, so she helps him out and they soon begin to look out for each other, forming an unusual and different relationship. Drey is a self-sufficient young lady, living with her single mother, who frequently works double shifts as an ambulance driver. She goes to visit her brother in jail and visits Frank (Anthony Mackie), the local drug dealer, who is a friend of Drey's brother. Will they be able to help each other escape the life they are destined for?<br /><br />Written by Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden and directed by Fleck, \\"Half Nelson\\" is a remarkably believable film. The performances by Gosling and Epps are the key to the success of \\"Half Nelson\\", but the story, direction, everything else about the film is as memorable and believable.<br /><br />I have never been that impressed by Gosling in his previous work, but that was, apparently, all preparation for his great performance in this film. As Dunne, he subtly reveals things about his character throughout, each time, providing a new link to the overall portrait, a new piece of the puzzle. We learn early on that Dunne is a drug addict, but what is surprising is that he is still able to function in his job, and rather well, as a history teacher. He teaches these kids how to think and many of them are responding. Then, we watch as he courts another teacher, and this helps us to learn how he deals with his relationships, and it makes sense when he seems to blow off an old friend. We learn that he has a book project that has been stalled and this provides another explanation for his drug habit. Or shows another consequence. Everything in his life is in limbo or has been stalled because he is caught in this drug hazed state.<br /><br />When his student, Drey, finds him in the bathroom, he needs help. Because she is kind to him, he feels that he can trust her and they begin a friendship, looking out for each other, trying to help one another. This may seem theatrical, but it works because both performers are entirely natural. Dunne is a Caucasian who is teaching at an inner city school because he wants to make a change. Drey is an inner city kid, living with her single mom, dealing with all of the bad influences in her neighborhood, but she survives. Another thing that helps both of these performances is their subtlety. Each is reveled in layers, as the film progresses, allowing us to assimilate the information and make the characters seem real. If all ofthis information were pounded over our head in the first few minutes, it wouldn't work. It would smack of Big Studio Hollywood. Look at the great performance by Gosling! Oscar Bait. But because the film is independent, the filmmakers don't have to hit emotional cues at certain prescribed times, they can let the characters unfold more naturally, aiding the performances and making them real. In fact, Gosling might stand a better chance of getting an Oscar nomination because the film is produced and released by an independent company.<br /><br />Shareeka Epps is also quite good as Drey, the young girl who is a student of Dunne's. As the story is about their relationship, we spend a significant amount of time with her. The character is 12, going on 40, and Epps manages to portray her strong-willed nature while at the same time revealing Drey's vulnerabilities. Again, this performance has stereotype written all over it, but because the actor is allowed time with the character, we learn things about her gradually, and it makes her believable. We can understand why she would be drawn to her teacher, why she would befriend him in a way, look after him. But since she is just 12, and has influences of her own, she can't really change his life that much. She has too much to deal with on her own. Left unsupervised for much of the time, she learns how to be self-sufficient and look out for herself. She goes to visit her brother in jail, alone, when her mother is too busy at work. She visits Frank, collecting money from him, because her brother worked with Frank and may have protected him from incarceration. But because she has no one in her life, she starts to look at Dunne and Frank for support, friendship, companionship, and a male influence. As the relationship with both men grows, a tug of war develops between them. Is either man a better influence? Will they be able to guide her in a significant way?<br /><br />As I describe each of these elements, I keep thinking about how `television movie of the week' it sounds. An inner city girl living in a home with her single mom, left to her own devices. A young Caucasian man who teaches at the junior high and becomes a drug addict. Just reading it on paper almost makes my stomach churn. But this is yet another reason to see the film. The filmmakers have created a believable, interesting portrait of these two main characters and all of their influences and problems. The key to the film is that everything is revealed in stages, slowly, allowing us to assimilate before learning something new. Everything is a piece of the puzzle and we learn of certain pieces at certain times. It isn't a linear progression, making it seem more like we are watching real people go about their lives.<br /><br />As Dunne sinks further into his problem, trying to maintain a normal existence, we witness as he comes apart at the seams. Gosling deserves a lot of credit for making this work. As he starts to unravel, becoming less aware in his class, more tired, more affected by the drug use, everything is subtle. Yet, he still manages to function. He is able to lecture his class, to teach them, stopping only when his nose starts to bleed. Entering the teacher's lounge, he states \\"I can't handle this anymore\\" and a fellow teacher mistakes the statement for a general comment about working with kids.<br /><br />Another element working in the film's favor is the ambiguous ending. As each character has reached a new low, they seem to realize they can help each other, a realization they have been working towards for some time. But will they be able to help each other? We don't know because the film ends before the story does. This helps to maintain the realism of the story and their problems; each is in a place that will take a lot of time to work out of, so it would seem unnatural to have a happy, sappy resolution tying everything up in the last few minutes.<br /><br />\\"Half Nelson\\" is a film that will be difficult to find, but it deserves the effort and your attention.

B00004VWAF|5.0|This 1972 release is intense.  Period.  And don't let the cover art fool you - the cartoon images on the front cover have nothing to do with the seething fury that lurks within the CD case.  In fact, come to think of it, a Jackson Pollock would have been more far more appropriate as cover art and is certainly more in keeping with the music.  Editorial comments aside, this is yet another remarkable Miles album and was his most controversial.<br /><br />Alongside Miles (electronically altered trumpet) is a large ensemble including: John McLaughlin and David Creamer (electric guitar); Herbie Hancock and Harold Williams Jr. (electric organ, possibly moog synthesizer); Jack DeJohnette (drums); Don Alias and James Mtume (percussion); Michael Henderson (electric bass guitar); David Leibman and Carlos Garnett (tenor saxophone); Teo Macero (saxophone); William Hart (drums and percussion); Badal Roy (tabla); and Colin Walcott (sitar).<br /><br />This iteration of the Miles Davis band had an unbelievably disciplined rhythm section.  In fact, the machine-gun like and staccato bursts on the drums and the ostinato on the bass guitar seemed to draw the most fire from critics when the album was released.  I happen to like the approach quite a bit because it reminds me of the meditative drones that minimalist composers like Terry Riley were writing at the time.  The soloists are also excellent (of course) and weave their parts seamlessly into the hypnotic trance set up by the rhythm section.  Unfortunately, you do not hear too much of Miles - according to the CD liner notes, this was another thing the critics harped on.  The synthesizer textures are pretty interesting as are the tabla and percussion parts (the sleigh bells come to mind) - they add a very interesting dimension to the music.<br /><br />Like a lot of Miles output during this period, the pieces are long: Tracks 1-4 comprise a 20 minute or so suite, while Helen Butte clocks in at 16'07\\".  Musically, the pieces incorporate elements of German avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, some free jazz, and American minimalism, although influences taken from James Brown and other soul/funk musicians can be heard as well.  I have to admit though - this is unlike any funk I have ever heard before.  In fact, it lurches along in fits and starts and quite frankly, is about as funky as a seizure.  Or a sneezing fit.<br /><br />Well I could easily go on and on raving about this album and the enormous contribution Miles made to music but I won't.  This is supposed to be a review after all.  If you enjoyed On the Corner, you might also like Live at the Fillmore East (March 1970); Bitches Brew (1970); Live Evil (1971); and A Tribute to Jack Johnson (1971).  This is all simply amazing stuff.e elements of German avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, some free jazz, and American minimalism, although influences taken from James Brown and other soul/funk musicians can be heard as well.

0375831002|5.0|This book is amazing and should be required reading for every adult. I'm not sure about its being marketed for young adults even though the main character ages from 10-14 in the bulk of the story. The book deals with death (who acts as the narrator) and the Holocaust - difficult subjects for adults to handle much less teenagers. <br /> <br />Marketing issues aside, I thought the book was extremely well-written. It was a risk having Death narrate the book, but it was a risk well-taken. And to give Death human characteristics was a coup, making it easier to relate to him. I especially loved the scene when Liesel's brother dies on the train and Death says, \\"I waved at them. Nobody waved back.\\" (Not an exact quote.) That little exchange shows just how lonely Death is. Nobody sees him, nobody wants to be his friend. And the most poignant line in the book is the final sentence where Death says, \\"I am haunted by humans.\\" Human beings are afraid of Death and yet we create war which keeps Death busy.  <br /> <br />Even though the book is 550 pages, it is fast-paced and hard to put down. I highly recommend this book.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I think it's hilarious that this release is getting such scathing reviews, yet it's currently #29 in DVD sales, and will only go lower as the release date gets closer.  Obviously people are buying it, regardless of what a \\"ripoff\\", or how \\"money-hungry\\" George Lucas is.  Come on - people wanted the original versions and now you're getting them!
0380789019|2.0|I'd heard so much hype about Gaiman that I finally decided to check out his supposed masterpieces of dark fantasy.<br /><br />The first few pages of the book are oozing potential... once you get past the fact that Gaiman writes at a 4th grade level.  I originally supposed that his \\"child-like\\" approach to dark fantasy was part of his appeal.  I was wrong.  He really writes fiction as if he's still writing comic books or screen plays.<br /><br />This book is extremely episodic; little pointless \\"quests\\" are blown up way beyond their resolutions.  Characters are bare bones with no thought processes or histories to flesh them out.  No background or history is given for most of them, and I couldn't force myself to care about any of them.  I could hardly force myself to finish the book.<br /><br />Overall, it was hugely disappointing.  I'm accustomed to reading fantasy and SF with teeth, horns, and PLOT.  One page out of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" has more substance than this entire book.<br /><br />I'm sure the die-hard Gaiman fans out there will all rate this review as unhelpful simply because I'm in the minory.  I challenge and encourage these poor souls to pick up something that is one notch closer to literature and notch further from comics.  Try Tolkien, the epitome of high fantasy.  Or try Robin Hobb's \\"Farseer\\" books for a rollicking fun ride (notably easier to read than Tolkien).  If you're set on urban fantasy, grab Rachel Caine's \\"Weather Warden\\" books, which are fast-paced and sexy.
B000FZETKC|5.0|I just love John Hughes Romantic Comedies of the 80's. It gave the middle class boy or girl in the growing decadeance of the era with big money and big hair a chance to shine. A butch girl played by Mary Stuart Masterson hangs out with her best buddy ( Eric Stolz) and his infatuation for the it girl (Lea Thompson) who is going out with the rich and popular it boy (Craig Sheffer)the catch is the character played by Mary Stuart Masterson is not a dyke but much in love with her best friend. Cute movie , Cute ending. Sweet and Simple.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Based on the popular video game series which in most cases is a \\"destined to fail\\" situation, SILENT HILL does what seemingly no other video game adaptation has been able to perform and that is to make a feature film that stands alone outside of it's predecessors without leaving the uninitiated viewers without feeling like they arer missing part of the story due to lack of playing the games. <br /> <br />Starring Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black, Man on Fire) and Sean Bean (Fellowship of the Rings, National Treasure) SILENT HILL takes one on a disturbing adventure through a town rotting in mysteries and plagued by it's own actions.  The film is a little slow at the start but culminates in one of the most intense and bloodiest endings in cinema in the past few years. <br /> <br />SILENT HILL is definitely not a film for the timid or the easily scared...so enter at your own risk!!!
B000H7JD4K|5.0|A Matter of Life and Death is Album of the Year material.  From the sweeping melodic guitar solos of Dave Murray, to the anthemic vocals of warbler Bruce Dickinson, A Matter of Life and Death encompasses everything great about Iron Maiden in one package.  Steve Harris and Adrian Smith co-wrote most of the tracks on the album.  The end result is one of the strongest metal albums in years, consistent from start to finish in it's musicality and songwriting.  From the opening track, typically reserved for mediocre radio play, the melodies and musicianship keep the listener entranced.  Steve Harris experiments with Bass synth, which greatly benefits the material, and pushes Maiden into the progressive metal genre on The Legacy.  Bruce sings his heart out on every song, and offers a vocally brilliant and complex layer to the music that we have not heard from him since perhaps Somewhere in Time.  Nikko's drums are perhaps the best of his career.  Kevin Shirley masterfully mixed the album live in the studio with incredible results, and really pulled the best possible drum performance from Nikko.  Lyrically, this album has a running theme of war and religion.  From the anti-nuclear message of Brighter Than A Thousand Suns (instantly classic Maiden, how playing God has come back to bite us) to the accusatory message of For the Greater Good of God, Maiden continues to explore the hipocrisy and complexities when Mankind mixes religion, faith and war. This album is defintiely a guitar players album, with all three Maiden guitarists at their best.  Finally Janick Gers has managed to incorporate his style to compliment Smith and Murray, as he has moved from the more wild rock concert solo to a more structured and thought out guitar line.  There is not a throw away track on this album.  It's not Maiden's fastest album.  The tempo is mid tempo throughout, with time changes and gallops mixed in, as well as blistering solos.  However, Maiden has not sacrificed anything from their paston A Matter of Life and Death.  Maiden has just put themselves into a whole new category of musicianship with original and refreshing material.  This is what being in a band is all about.  This album is more than the fans could have asked for.
0375713751|5.0|I loved this book, did not want it to end. It will be enjoyed by mothers and non-mothers, working or non-working; Ms. Pearson is brilliant in her descriptions and humor. I absolutely recommend reading it!
0786868694|5.0|I have tormented my family for years with episodes of Nigella Bites, even if we've seen them many times before.  There is just something about her enthusiasm for food and eating, mixed with her sardonic commentary, that I can't get enough of.  I recently purchased it and I've been reading it like a favorite old novel that you go back to again and again.  I'm a vegetarian, mind you, so I'm not going to slavishly stick to her recipes (and she puts forth pretty openly that most of her recipes are suggestions or jumping off points, with possibly the exception of the cakes).  Having said that, many of her combinations are inspired, particularly her desserts- Chocolate Cloud Cake, Chocolate Pots, Chocolate Fudge Cake, Toffee Pudding Cake, Syllabub, Rice Pudding- yum yum yum.  But some of her savory offerings are stellar as well, particularly her Vietnamese salad, matzoh ball soup, pasta and meatballs, and Pumpkin Curry, all of which I've been cooking (meatless of course) for a while.<br /><br />Again, however, what keeps me coming back isn't so much her culinary perfection (I think Lawson would have a good laugh about that, actually) as much as her devotion to good food and the \\"proper\\" enjoyment of it.<br /><br />If you're looking for something you can follow slavishly for always spectacular results, this may not be it.  If, however, you want something to stoke your culinary joie de vivre, take a look.
B00011RPB0|4.0|Sorry previous reviewer, I neither loved nor hated this film. And reaching a resolution to the question, will they or won't they, is forward plot movement. This film goes expertly well to a place.<br /><br />But this film could easily be called \\"My Weekend with Bill Murray\\" because the \\"Bill Murray\\" presence was much too strong--or should I say--is much too strong to be contained within this mostly serious, independently constructed character. The well-established Bill Murray persona overwhelmed the Bob Harris character. This was not Bill Murray's performance of a lifetime as many reviewers have said. He was very good in this film as a mellowed Bill Murray, but \\"Groundhog Day\\" was Bill Murray's performance of a lifetime so far, followed by his part in \\"Caddyshack.\\"  Those are the parts that closely fit Bill Murray. This Bob Harris character who's a big action movie star who's hired to glamorize Suntory and who's so attractive to all the women (well, at least the white women) who pass him by?--come on, that's not Bill Murray and it makes no sense putting him into such a character. Mel Gibson or Wesley Snipes, maybe, but Bill Murray and all his gaunt looks and sardonic humor? Bill Murray in this part doesn't ring true at all for me, especially since he's still doing his usual shtick, although a very subdued, chastened version of it mixed in with dramatic acting. There's still the familiar SNL comic mixed into this Bob Harris.<br /><br />And then the fact that this supposedly major American movie star, whose face is plastered on billboards, can walk all around Tokyo in all his fame and tallness and not get recognized and swamped by any of the Japanese on the streets or in the restaurants? Ridiculous. Where are all the teenage Japanese schoolgirls huddled on the side and pointing and giggling? Where are the paparazzi? Either you break down and call this film what it essentially is-- an underwritten Bill Murray film--or you concede that it was miscast and in many ways makes no sense. And then on top of everything else, they make his relationship with his wife on the phone so one-dimensional with she so cold and he so obviously jilted. What an easy setup.<br /><br />So it sounds like I disliked the film? Nope, I really liked it and recommend it.  It was a nice diversion, very different in its way, and had an interestingly delicate relationship as its subject. This is another movie which is obviously a finely tuned collaboration of many cinematic artists and Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray list a few of them in their interview in the Bonus Features on the DVD. It was a fun, successful depiction of Tokyo and some of its zany culture. The relationship between Bob Harris and Charlotte was different than the standard romance, and there's always a question of whether it's a true romance or not. I can't help thinking it was, in essence, more a father-daughter relationship and the real message of this film is, it's ok to let go of Daddy. Bill Murray in this film, as the sardonic Bill Murray, has the quality that gay men stereotypically have in many stories about confused women--he's safe to talk to and hang out with, and in this film, as a much older man, he is at times, almost more like a doting father, or teacher, or older brother, but definitely, at all times safe. The dialogue was too sparse. You'd think someone who just graduated with a degree in philosophy would have more intelligent, or at least, more intellectual things to say. She's pretty lightweight, all in all. Just a grown kid, newly woman, with a funk.<br /><br />So that's it, a somewhat fun film which is, like someone previously characterized it, quite underwhelming, but well worth watching. No one can doubt that Sofia Coppola will get better and better as she gets more practice as a filmmaker and will probably adds some real greats to the cinematic heritage. Maybe she first needs to get past her Daddy. Sorry, that wasn't meant to sound mean. It just came obviously to mind in my armchair psychologist brain while watching this film.<br /><br />One thing strange, the R rating is only because of one short scene in a strip joint which could easily have been edited out or redone to PG standards. I guess they really wanted that R rating. Explain that.<br /><br />And yes, as someone earlier pointed out, the lack of now-standard viewer controls with this DVD is really annoying. Don't keep pushing the \\"DVD menu\\" button, it won't work. But it's a good movie despite all the above. Enjoy.
B00062J00S|5.0|It's a Wonderful Life- It's a classic well known to every generation, even those who claim they hate black and white movies and who never watch family films. Why are Frank Capra's films so universal and timeless, especially this one? Well, watch it and find out.<br /><br />The story concerns George Bailey (James Stewart), a guy from a small town that everyone knows and loves. As a boy he worked in a drugstore, his father at a savings and loan bank, and when his father died, he took over, despite aching to see the world and go to college. He did his duty but found happiness in a girl in town, Mary (Donna Reed) who became his wife. However, through the storybook life, there was a sense of longing for childhood dreams and a feeling of emptiness in George. This only manifested itself when Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the local rich curmudgeon with selfish ambition, antagonized George. Finally, at a turning point in his life, George is faced with failure and faces an angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) whose purpose is to pull George back from the precipice of suicide.<br /><br />It is difficult not to get wrapped up in such a story. You don't have to be from a small town, you don't have to be married, and you don't have to be middle aged to understand this movie and to love it. The themes and the sentiments are universal. Everyone likes to feel they are basically good and that the forces against them are evil; that is what this story is about, good trying to win over evil. Such a basic idea is enhanced by wonderful camerawork, brilliant acting, and amazing directing done in the golden age of Hollywood.<br /><br />This is no Christmas story, so do not hesitate to watch it any day of the year. The uplifting tone is often associated with an allotted time for giving each year, but it is appropriate for any time. Perhaps that is what we all need.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|As many others, I am a fan.  The series, \\"Firefly\\" got me hooked and this movie is an incredible ride of action, drama, and fun.  I was thrilled that the story continues in \\"Serenity\\".  The characters are the same that you pulled for and loved in the series.<br /><br />For those who have never seen the series (you need to), you can still enjoy the movie.  Joss Whedan is a gifted storyteller-you will make the crew of \\"Serenity\\" your friends and you will not want the movie to end.  It gives you a thrill all the way through-not a dull moment.<br /><br />The movie will keep you on the edge of your seats yet it will also make you laugh and cry. I love science fiction, action movies and this is definitely one- but is also has a heart. You will not be disappointed in making this a part of your day.<br /><br />I am glad that many questions were answered and there was a sense of finality from the series.  But, I am also glad that it ended where there could be another movie in the future.  I sure hope so because I don't want to say goodbye to these friends.

B00008G9JM|3.0|While in high school, my friends and I waited with bated breath for the next Tull album.  We'd been hooked at Stand Up, went gaga for Benefit, rejoiced with Aqualung, smiled at Living in the Past, and scraped our jaws off the floor with Thick as a Brick.  Then, instead of a new album, we got rumors...Anderson hated the new stuff, it's to be scraped.  They'll do a live album next because they're out of ideas...Ian is thinking of a *gasp* solo effort...etc. <br />So when Passion Play finally hits the stores, we're on it in a flash.  We listen...look at each other...put on the other side...look at each other...and we laugh!  What the heck are they thinking?  What's with all these SAXAPHONES?  What the heck is Ian trying to say with these lyrics?  What is our favorite band doing?!? <br />We listen a few more times, discuss the ramifications of what this album will do to their popularity, disect a few passages, and come to the conclusion... <br /> <br />...It's O.K.  Just O.K.  Because when the music cranks, it's unstoppable, but the lyrics are obtuse and confusing, then there's this \\"Hare\\" thing in the middle, and...it's just O.K. <br /> <br />...30 some odd years later, my friends are memories living in other states, Tull is still soldiering along, and Passion Play is still just O.K.  To me there are more enjoyable, accessable, and tighter albums.  I would have liked to hear a whole album of the Chateau D'isaster tapes - get it on the Nightcap album - but even those lyrics were inscrutable.  But if you are a Tull fan (I still am), get this album.  If you are not, get one of their other classics.
B00005QGAV|3.0|When this cd came out in 1991, the public (I admit, me too) was givin' Michael a really hard time because of his very dramatic skin lighting (started between the Victory Tour and Bad Album), wierd choice of wardrobe (unlike the simple sequin jacket and white glove, he switches to ace bandages, boot buckles, and 99 cent store tattered wife-beaters - lol), wacky hairstyle (thats why the jherri curl was a disaster), his strong desire for lil' boys (why he bulit the Neverland Ranch of which got him into tons of trouble), and might I add the \\"Black and White\\" video that was chopped off in half after several complaints about him masterbating and breakin' windows and stuff on the street scene.  Because of that, America did not give the Dangerous album a chance.  Although I consider this album to be mediocre, but I admit, I love most of his fast-paced Teddy Riley penned cuts (\\"Jam\\", \\"In The Closet\\", \\"She Drives Me Wild\\", \\"Remember The Time\\", and \\"Can't Let Her Get Away\\").  The only number one pop song off the album, \\"Black and White\\" was good, but I admit that the video really sucked.  The other tracks were either mediocre or sucked big time.  The main flaw about this album is that its too filling.  Its stuffed with many crappy cuts such as \\"Give In To Me\\" and the boring \\"Will You Be There.\\"  Off The Wall, Thriller, and Bad were only less than 50 minutes each.  Dangerous exceeds the limit to about nearly 75 minutes long and the fillers prove the mediocricy.  Not bad album, but this album and his future releases are too filling.  Appearance does'nt make the music.  Michael does and this showed a good effort, despite what was going on with him around 1991-93.
B000002UAU|4.0|After reading several pages of reviews, I must admit that I also agree that this isn't necessarily the Beatles' best effort and that it may be somewhat over-rated.  That being said, it's still a great album.  It blows my mind when people say it's not as good as the music of today.  They need to realize that this is actually the starting point for the best music of today.  Kind of like saying you respect your next door neighbor who goes camping every weekend more than Lewis & Clark!

B00005JP87|3.0|\\"The Illusionist\\" bills itself as a turn-of-century head trip of narrative twists and inexplicable sorcery. And while the last half of the movie is an elaborate con, the true strength of writer/director Neil Burger's film is a simple romantic tale of love lost and found, featuring quartet of effective performances - including one from Jessica Biel.<br /><br />Yes, Jessica Biel, who adds a little acting to go with those lips and that hair. She's Sophie, a Hungarian countess who discovers a \\"forbidden\\" lover has become Eisenheim The Illusionist (Edward Norton). Eisenheim's tricks are seamless. It's also too quick for the magic-savvy crowds of Vienna, who can't unravel just how he grows that orange tree, or manages to freeze the sword of Austrian Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) so that no \\"unworthy\\" man can tug it off the ground.<br /><br />Leopold considers himself a divine intellectual above any trickery he can`t figure out, so he orders Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to shut Eisenheim down. By then, Sophie, who promises to marry the prince as part of a plan to overthrow Leopold's father, has shared a forbidden carriage ride with Eisenheim, and is ripe to share his bed, too.<br /><br />\\"Do you really want to disappear with me?\\" he asks her.<br /><br />\\"The Illusionist\\" then shifts into its hour-long final act, which involves a murder, jewels and voodoo magic that has the peasants rioting. Berger adapted Steven Millhauser's short story and added the romantic angle while flattening the depth of Inspector Uhl, rescued by Giamatti with mild humor and humility.<br /><br />Berger's twist - the \\"turn\\" in magician-speak -  is clever but predictable. \\"The Illusionist\\" has too gentle a soul - and too modest an aim - to end any other way,  but it works because Norton and Biel generate an understated chemistry; there's a lot of passion under their benign, expressionless faces.  Norton's is nobody's first choice as a romantic lead, which makes him more effective as a magician. Biel effectively plays against type as Sophie; what attracts her to Eisenheim is not his looks or fortune, but his sway over the mysteries of the world. She's captivated by his gifts, and Biel, a superficial actor until now, holds her own with the intimidating, enigmatic Norton.<br /><br />And finally, there is Leopold. Sewell is a magnificent Sunday ham,  marrying unbridled evil with anguished martyrdom - \\"I've done everything I can! Too much!\\" -  to create one of those pathetic ego monsters that echoes Peter Sellers and Christopher Walken. Inspector Clouseau, meet the King of New York.effective as a magician.

B00005NKKV|5.0|Next to a greatest hits album, this has to be the best offering Simon and Garfunkel ever gave the world of music?  Forty years old and it still stands strong! <br /> <br />I love great harmonies (Don and Phil of The Everly Brothers, John and Paul of The Beatles, Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, Teresa and Mark of The Echoes, etc.) but S&G take the cake here! <br /> <br />Like Dylan's \\"Freewheeling\\" album, Simon and Garfunkel's second album beats its predecessor effortlessly for the beauty and strength of the original material.  The instrumentation is perfect and the songs are songs for all times--not just the 1960's! <br /> <br />My favorite release by my favorite New York group.
B000G75AE8|4.0|If you hated Reign and Seasons, you'll probably hate this one too. If you loved them, it's still not a safe bet, but it's worth a listen. <br /> <br />The good news is that this is easily Slayer's best effort in years, especially if you prefer their classic sound. Lombardo's return has definitely been an improvement. <br /> <br />The bad news is that it's still not as good as their older stuff and a lot of it sounds suspiciously familiar. It's sort of like one of those \\"Lost Tracks\\" CDs that a band puts out after their frontman dies - like leftovers and alternates from Reign and Seasons (not such a bad thing). A lot of the \\"blasphemy\\" seems forced or overly calculated (\\"we're still evil, we promise!!\\"). <br /> <br />I still like it a lot. I certainly prefer it to their last several efforts. I'm hoping this was just a warmup for greater things.
B0000028M7|5.0|I first heard Alice in Chains 'Dirt' on a compilation album called 'Dad, I Blew Up America' that featured two tracks off 'Dirt', namely 'Rooster' and 'Hate to Feel'. It was 'Hate to Feel' that I particularly liked a lot so the album was a natural purchase and I can tell you I was not disappointed. Alice in Chains' always sounded like a mix of Black Sabbath's 'Paranoid' and Led Zeppelin's I & II and it's on 'Dirt' that they achieved that to near perfection while still sounding original. They should have called this their 'Greatest Hits' because all the songs are classics on Dirt. The thing that makes this record great is it's simplicity, there's nothing ostentatious or vague about it musically or lyrically. Musically it's rhythmically solid, bare, sometimes discordant and atonal and lyrically, direct, poignant and somewhat gleeful in it's delivery. The theme running through the record for the most part is that of drug taking, in particular Heroin, and it's in this quagmire that the dirt is delivered. 'Dirt' spoke on behalf of Generation X when it scaled the charts in 1992 helped along by the success of Nirvana and Soundgarden that swept away the glut of rubbish that clogged the rock charts before it. The early nineties was for a brief spell an exciting time for rock and say what you like about the so-called 'grunge scene' it produced its fair share of what will become classic records and it's undeniable that 'Dirt' was instrumental in building on the rock legacy for generations to come. It's an excellent album and a worthy addition to any collection, buy it if you don't already own it.
0679643362|5.0|Beautifully translated, evoking the majesty in the simple story of a man in his lifelong journey towards the attainment of Enlightenment.  Melodic in its tone but true to the original German Susan Bernofsky's translation has set a new standard among the various English translations currently available. As many times as I have read and enjoyed Siddhartha over the years (about 10 or so readings) never have I enjoyed a translation as much as Ms. Bernofsky's - a truly remarkable effort.
0375500901|4.0|Having read a few other books by Silva I figured this would be good. No mistake, it was very good. I enjoyed his walking you through all the steps in the tracking of a Terrorist. What has to be done and sometimes hurting your own to accomplish the capture. All in all a very well written book. I recommend it highly.
B000G759LW|4.0|Excellent album. One of the best of 2006 so far. <br /> <br />Out of all self appointed divas that came out in the late 90s that took to walk around half naked on stage to distract from their lack of talent (Britney anyone?) Christina finally shines. <br /> <br />She did her raunchy times, but as opposed to many others she doesn't need that anymore, she's got the voice, and what a voice!. All the critics that righteously accused her of screaming in her last effort \\"Stripped\\" can rest finally assured that they have been heard. Christina's vocals are outstanding and this album showcases them and makes them justice.   <br /> <br />I just hope this is the prelude of great things to come. <br />
B000002U82|5.0|This was the break through record for Pink Floyd that would place them in the super-league. The strength of the record lies in the song writing that is simple yet engaging and Dave Gilmore's guitar playing and voice is superb. Production wise this is well polished and the presence of the sax and backing vocalists just give it that little extra commercial potential. Overall the record works well as a whole yet I do feel 'Money' seems out of place. The problem with records like this that it is too easy to enjoy and all the sharp ends are neatly filed off and well packaged for your consumption.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong I think this is a magnificent record but is it really Pink Floyd's greatest album, I tend to think not. Is it the greatest record of all time? Most certainly not. Because a records sells 35 million copies does not make it automatically great. Because everybody and their grandmother thinks it's great, does not necessarily make it great. The problem with this record is that it sounds of its time, not that that's a bad thing, its just that it does not transcend time. The real indication of a great record is how many people it inspires to make records that sound like it. I can't think of many records that sound like this without sounding retrogressive. Some records released at the same time: Can's \\"Future Days\\"(1973); Nue!'s \\"2\\"(1973); King Crimson's \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\\"(1973); Robert Wyatt's \\"Rock Bottom\\"(1974); Tangerine Dream's \\"Phaedra\\"(1974) are by far more influential and enduring than Dark Side. If you don't own Dark Side then buy it because it is a very good record and deserves its five stars, but make sure you buy 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' also. 'Piper' is Floyds greatest, most influential and definitely one of the greatest of all time. Besides, how many people who think 'Dark Side' is Floyd's best have actually heard 'Piper'.
0060934719|4.0|This is definitely, as alot of people say, a fairy-tale for adults. It is only such, however, because there is a sex scene. I don't recall there being alot of complicated or harsh language. So it's basically a children's fairy-tale with some adult content. If you like children's fairy tales, you will love Stardust. It is very well done, and the imagery is fantastic. Although they're probably not the best books for comparision, I'd say that if you're an adult yet you still enjoy reading books like Ella Enchanted and the Neverending Story, you'll like this one.<br /><br />And, of course, if you're a Gaiman fan you'll love it. But Neverwhere is better.
B00004VXF2|5.0|I really enjoyed Metal Machine Music Parts I and IV and everything in between. This is music you can compare with Smiley Smile by the Beach Boys, Head by the Monkees, and Confusion Is Sex/Kill Your Idols by Sonic Youth in terms of relative avant-garde and artistic integrity. But there is nothing to compare this to in terms of categorizing its form. Metal Machine Music is so original and unsuspecting in its time and in the present time. It sounds better than most anything on the radio nowadays except college radio. It would fit perfectly on college radio but is too far ahead of its time.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Only a few movies really horrified me as a child: Dawn Of The Dead, The Shining, Phantasm, and Carrie. I despise The Shining because I read the book in junior high and saw that Kubrick, although brilliant, had butchered a book that was really too involved to put on celluloid. Carrie remains the only King novel-to-film that stands alone in itself as a horror classic, although the book is just as disturbing. <br /> <br />Carrie scared me as a five year old (I STILL remember the trailer!), then petrified me when my mom bought the novel, because the cover at the time was Sissy Spacek covered in blood...mom had to trash the book...sorry, Ma! Then I watched the movie with my sister when I was about eight....and well, I have probably seen it a HUNDRED times after that!!!! Never get tired of it! (Along with Phantasm and D.O.T.D.) <br /> <br />I'm not going to rehash the story....I just would like the younger horror fans to delve into the world of truly masterfully-crafted horror cinema made by the likes of DePalma, Romero, Cronenberg....I know I forgot someone, but DePalma outdid himself with this. The cinematography is fantastic, the morbidity, the expressions of horror; not blood n guts, but the horror of human beings' cruelty to one another...SHINES! Best adaptation of King's interpretation of small-town evil come to claim its own in an unassuming form. <br /> <br />Carrie is REQUIRED VIEWING for anyone who claims to be a horror fan...and I consider myself an old hand. If you haven't seen it, or The (original) Omen, you gotta zip the lip: ya know diddly.  <br /> <br />The main thing about this movie that stays with me is that as I got older, I really believed the actors in their roles: they were all exemplary. Sissy Spacek was so tragic as the pathetic Carrie White, her mother and tormentors, played beautifully by Piper Laurie, John Travolta, to name the more familiar faces, were so REAL. The movie now isn't horror to me, but sad. The all-powerful ENDING, which everyonementions here, still spooks me to this day...still tough to watch.  <br /> <br />Now if THAT doesn't make a classic, you tell me!
B000001DTM|5.0|Lyrically one can say that this is distinctly a man's record, from a male point of view. The central theme running through the album is that of betrayal, modern man cut adrift and the loss or equalization of power in modern relationships, or better still the fragmentation of relationships in the post modern age. The fact that woman does not necessarily need a man anymore is just unimaginable to him, so he continues to pursue her as if nothing has changed only to stumble and fall every time leaving him confused. He is however prepared to crawl. The record is like a wasteland of sexual ambiguity, littered with sexual innuendo and cruelty. The only track that offers any light has to be Acrobat with a need to keep on trying to love. If Bono is not writing from personal experience then I'm lead to believe that this is his greatest artistic achievement, however The Fly does say that all artists \\"kill their inspiration and sing about their grief\\".<br /><br />Sonically the album is also a rather giant leap for U2. It's not however a complete surprise, evidence of the new sound did start to appear on tracks like God part II in 1988. The most interesting thing though is the new claustrophobic sound of record that clearly has a roof over it's head, rather grimy also, instead of the massive desert expanses of the Joshua Tree. From the sick desperation in the vocal delivery and the industrial tones in the guitar playing one can hear the distinct yearning that man feels for a 'sense' of stability, that is also bourn out also by a rock solid rhythm section. The influence of European industrial music and hip-hop rhythms are clearly felt here.<br /><br />The sad thing about this record is that I believe it to the last truly great and complete U2 record. It appears that after this they began listening too much to what the critics were saying about the new U2 sound, and the process decided to play it safe by trying to stick to the formula instead of broadening it. I can only say that the last three albums are disappointing affairs to say the least. Achtung Baby however does belong with The Unforgettable Fire as U2's greatest albums. I only wish U2 had put out more records between these two. I estimate that I must have listened to this a least 2000 times.last three albums are disappointing affairs to say the least.

0805076476|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely, although I'm sure I could have liked it alot more if I hadn't watched the movie first. Sure, the movie is great, and it compliments the book well, but Fight Club is a book that needs to surprise you. I'm a huge fan of Palahnuik's writing, and I love the way he twists the plot and inserts little bits of useless information into the storyline, but if you've seen the movie, you pretty much know what's going to happen next. Some of the quotations are word for word, and although the ending's different (better, in my opinion), you might find yourself disappointed that you know what's going to happen.<br /><br />That being said, read the book whether or not you've seen the cinematic adventure. It's a brilliant piece of writing, especially if you love Chuck, and it's definitely worth reading. But if you have the option of digesting one medium of the story before the other, read the book.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Yes. Playing this album is like remembering a prayer or going to a place of refuge. It is a spiritual experience as well as a musical experience. Pet Sounds is over 40 years old and is still timeless in every way. I am obsessed with the sounds, the melodies, the lyrics, the harmonies, and the beauty. I will listen to Pet Sounds a million times, but a million times would not be enough. I will listen to it forever. Maybe someday there will be a Super Audio CD of Pet Sounds like there is 5.1 Surround Sound of it on DVD. Long live Pet Sounds!
0792841344|5.0|Classic, 'nuff said (Thanks, Stan Lee)! <br /> <br />Phantasm had the greatest tagline: \\"If this movie doesn't scare you, you're already dead! \\" I still laugh at that one. Horror fans should know this movie's best parts cold. Bizarre for sure, Coscarelli really is an imaginative writer. <br /> <br />Mike's fear of death is compounded by an alien who steals the dead! How insane is that? Truly trippy! This movie is so freaky, I am sure it will have you spooked because Angus Scrimm really is terrifying, and unstoppable. The first Terminator! <br /> <br />Highly recommended; for true horror fans, you all should already have it. If not, don't look in that mirror behind your door....heh heh!
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors debut record has to arguably be one of the greatest debut records of all time, up there with The Mothers of Invention's `Freak Out' (1966) The Velvet Underground's `Velvet Underground & Nico' (1967) Jimi Hendrix's `Are You Experienced?' (1967) The Clash's `The Clash' (1977) and Black Flag's `Damaged' (1981). The thing it lacks is the influential stature of some of the above albums but it had the chart success.<br /><br />In 1967, the summer of love, it climbed to the no.1 spot on the billboard charts mostly aided by the success of the edited single of `Light My Fire'. While the rest of the album has many highlights like `Break On Through (To The Other Side)', `Crystal Ship' the focus of the attention is on `Light My Fire' and the Oedipal drama of `The End' that got them banned from the Whisky-A-Go-Go. `Light My Fire' with it's lengthy solo is an excellent example of modal playing which was based on the music of jazz giants John Coltrane and Miles Davis. The idea is to improvise over just one or two chords without falling into the pentatonic trap. Interestingly according to Krieger he used the same two chords Coltrane used on `My Favourite Things' (Am & Bm). Apart from the obvious reference to drug taking in the lyrics the structure of the song emphasises the swirling repetitive `high' of the solo before the final come down into the 3rd and 4th verses and outro.<br /><br />`The Doors' is probably the only popular record that adequately captured the true atmosphere of 1967, the summer of love as well as its darker elements. Love's `Forever Changes' (1968) may be a better record but like the Velvet Underground's no one heard it. The problem with the record is that it was virtually impossible to follow up. All the albums released afterwards seem to somehow pale in comparison, with possibly `L.A. Women' being the only exception, however this is an outstanding debut that is nearly 40years old, yet still remarkably fresh sounding. It should be in all record collections.
B000001TVD|5.0|Parliament/Funkadelic set the tone with this album. I did not hear it until my adult years and This by far is a great CD. <br /> <br />If you have an ear to ear, you know that \\"Mother Earth\\" has been used and humanity is the one that \\"stuck it to her\\" and then left her. Parliament/Funkadelic  was and still is very deep! The music alone sets you in a groove that you have to experience for yourself! They let you know in \\"Can You Get To That\\" what is what in that day and time and in some respects, still applies.Enough of the psyco mumbo jumbo, this album is hot!! This set the tone for what was to come next. Eddie Hazel is magnificent on Maggot Brain and as far as I am concerned Jimi could have learned a thing or two from Eddie! These two styles are not such a comparison as many people write---Eddie, Tawl, Billy and Tiki were in a class all by themselves not to mention Bernie \\"Da Vincci\\" Worrell--The Woo-Man himself took music to another level. \\"So sit back and dig while they do it to your earhole\\"......
B000002LTU|3.0|With his very last project, DOO-BOP, trumpeter Miles Davis brought a fitting, if not exactly earth-shattering, conclusion to four and a half decades of forward-looking music by incorporating the commercially - and, perhaps, culturally - ascendant sounds of rap into his boundless conceptual universe. While few if any fans would be likely to rank this album (which was, alas, patched together posthumously) among Miles' classics, the Maestro could still blow a mean horn even in his final days, and there's plenty here worth listening to despite the distracting hip-hop overlays on a few tracks and lots of programmed percussion throughout. Granted, DOO-BOP might well have proven a worthier coda to jazz's most important postwar career had the artist himself lived to assemble it; but even as is it's among the better post-1980 Davis efforts and a good place for rap enthusiasts to begin the journey into jazz.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|My intro to nightwish was the Once album. I was blown away and wanted to hear more from them so I bought Oceanborn and Wishmaster. From what I heard and read these 3 albums are their best. I am not disappointed in the least. All 3 of these albums are definitely worth buying if you like the operatic metal style. Tarja Turunen's voice soars. Thank you Nightwish, for making some kick a** beautiful music!
B00028HBKM|5.0|First off I want to say, I have never really been a religious person, but I do consider myself a Christian. I also must say I really had no desire to see this movie. It just didn't seem to be one to really spark my interest. <br />The night before Easter last year this movie was shown on HBO. I had nothing planned for the night, so I watched it. At first I was bored. I wasn't big on the English subtitles, even though I watch everything with subtitles, but I continued watching.  <br />This is probably the only movie that has ever touched me like it did. I was in tears, sobbing. The acting was incredible & the pain endured in the movie almost made you feel as if it were real. I think this movie was protrayed very well. I would recommend this movie, but I would like to warn you to watch it & not plan anything for the rest of the day. I was glad it was late so I could just come home and think about things & cry. Trust me, if you felt like I did it will change your outlook on many things.
B00005JL0I|2.0|Originally intended as a Peter Sellers vehicle, &#34;Casino Royale&#34; (1967) became something radically different when the mercurial comic actor abandoned the project before its completion. Rather than throw in the towel, producer Charles Feldman threw away more millions to salvage the unsalvageable. Hence the multiple directors and numerous guest stars filling in the gaps left by Sellers' departure. The result is an extravagant mess. Sellers provides the best moments in this ill-fated 007 spoof - highlighted by the baccarat sequence with Orson Welles.
B00006JKON|4.0|Actually 4- 1/2 stars. I took off 1/2 a star for the somewhat overbearing orchestrations. Other than that, another Tull extravaganza full of lyrical and musical twists and turns, obscure intrumental usage and great guitar by Martin Barre (as always.) The reason for the title of this review... on the first listen I was kind- of \\"unh.\\" But then I turned up the volume, gave it another spin and discovered a rich tapestry of sounds that is what makes Tull's music so very endearing. By the way, I have a great stereo, so if I don't have the volume set at least at 10, I don't believe all the speakers are activated! Once that occurs, with a mega- talented bunch like Jethro Tull on the changer, it's pure bliss! Every player on this disc contributes to the utmost (I don't believe Ian Anderson is capable of anything less!) One of the most talented songwriters of our time, even on these shorter, more commercial tunes. \\"Skating Away...\\" is one of my fave Tull tunes in history, so what have you got to lose? Just listen more than once and with the volume up (and pump- out that bass!)

B000GPIPVU|3.0|I was disappointed with the CD.  While Ray's voice and lyrics are mesmorizing, how could they not be, I found all the horns unnecessary and downright annoying. It was the simplicity of his music, the emotion in his voice that carried us away. A little drums, a little strings, sure, but this CD is overkill. You have to wade through all the instruments to hear what he is saying. I have a \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" theory, and it wasn't broke.
B000002KB8|5.0|Here is where it all began: Heavy Metal as we all know and love it! The gloomiest,most explosive, diverse music and perhaps the scariest album cover to boot! This album makes all other doom and gloom bands look like pop music! And the remastering is exquisite. The cymbal crashes send shivers down your spine. Working with music for 30- plus years, I know a little about sound mixing, and this is some of the best! And the music: some of the most mature ever to be placed on one debut disc. These are some very- well written songs with \\"picturesque\\" lyrics, ones that allow you to experience the stories being set forth. Although this recording isn't as technically brilliant as later offerings (Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or Sabotage,) the raw energy hits you like a bolt of lightning. I enjoy every single track here and I'm sure you will also. I keep coming back to this recording  more than any other by this group. Love it!

0743243153|1.0|It is apparent that the first premise in Peck's book is that in order for humans to be a whole being, one must grow through spirituality (or enlightenment) attained through \\"grace\\" with the main purposes of gaining \\"capacity and understanding of serendipity\\" (309) and through \\"spiritual evolution, whereby people grow towards godhood\\" (270) and \\"become God\\" (283).   <br /> <br />The second premise is that if a person is to be a complete being, one must possess a certain amount of \\"freedom\\" and grow in the capacity of love.  Freedom can be through several avenues such as sexual \\"self-expression and exploration\\" (147).   <br /> <br />Peck's premises are secular in nature, mainly concentrating on one's self.  He confuses the true God with a man-made form of a god.  Peck instructs readers not to conform to a particular religion, but inundates them with own \\"religion,\\" which is a mixture of pseudo-Christian philosophies, Eastern mysticism, and post-modern thoughts.  One of the ways he does this is by quoting Bible verses out of context.   <br /> <br />Peck's version of love is a free-for-all deficient of morality and decency.  Sexual intimacy is devoid of commitment through a covenant marriage, and reduces it to a spontaneous animalistic act.  In fact, love is his excuse for sexual transgression of the therapist-client relationship.   <br /> <br />It is a sad situation in our society when Peck's book becomes a bestseller.  A \\"road less traveled\\" offers what the general population desires to hear: find your own way and do as you please.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I bought this CD a couple days ago after hearing \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies.\\"  I am amazed at how the rest of the album actually makes that song seem somewhat mediocre.  If you like their song on the radio right now, you will most likely love the rest of the album.  The whole thing has a theatrical/circus theme with a bit of techno mixed in, but it's mainly just good old alternative rock.  The lyrics really are great and you'll find yourself laughing when you finally realize what he just said.  There are some people on here that hate the album and act like Panic is just a Fallout Boy wannabe band.  I've listened to Fallout Boy, and I grew tired of them quickly.  I think Brendon Urie has a much better voice than the lead singer of Fallout Boy and that he really knows how to use it.  He mixes it up so much and never lets the listener get comfortable with a song (that goes for the band as a whole).  Most of their songs defy the typical song style, not following the verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus style that listeners get so used to.  I won't actually rate the songs because I think my opinion will change over time (I always end up liking songs more over time or if I really love them at first, I'll listen to em too much and get tired of them).  What's crazy is that with most CDs you buy for one song (at first), you have to listen to that song so many times to get it through your system before you really want to listen to the rest of the album.  That's not the case with this one.  I Write Sins is an awesome song, but it really doesn't give the band credit compared to a lot of the other stuff and I think people will realize that as they keep releasing stuff.   <br /> <br />If you're tryin to decide on the CD, all of the songs are good but you should really listen to the samples of #2, 3, 4, 5, and 9.  They're not really much better (if at all) than the other songs, but I think they've got better hooks and will make you want to buy the album to listen to the rest.
B000FIMG68|5.0|After seeing so many generic knockoffs on TV, such as Friends/Seinfeld ripoffs in the comedy genre, Law and Order and CSI in crime dramas and ER in medical dramas, it was quite refreshing to watch Lost which not only was compelling but it actually told a story built on a core mythology rather than just case/patient/adventure/monster of the week shows. While yes, season 2 isn't as compelling as season 1, it's certainly very much an addicting show that entertains as well as frustrates at times. <br /> <br />The hatch door has been blown open and we discover what's inside: a computer which apparently regulates electromagnetic activity where inputting the code \\"4 8 15 16 23 42\\" resets the counter to 108 minutes. There's conflict over why the button needs to be pushed and we get more up close and personal with the \\"Others\\" as well as a new group of survivors. Some other mysteries are delved into as well as more revealing flashbacks for various characters, leading way to a big finale that thad everyone talking. <br /> <br />One of the things that propelled Lost besides the mythology was the character's background. Everyone had a story to tell that wasn't boring and bland. However, you started to notice only certain ones were actually interesting. For every Locke's father problems to Jack's job problems to Jin/Sun's relationship, you had mildly interesting backstories like new character Ana-Lucia, Michael's or Charlie's. And while the numbers aspect is interesting, I never liked Hurley's character at all and plus the constant \\"dude\\" gets irritating. \\"Dude, like this is totally messed up, dude. I need help, man, I gotta eat dude\\".  <br /> <br />As usual with Lost, certain answers don't arrive, instead piling on the questions, leading for probably what's going to be a huge finale of nothing but plot revelations. For instance, the unbelievably interesting \\"monster\\" appears less than what it should be then there's the whole numbers thing, the interest in Walt, the Others' identity(apparently saved for season 3), the Black Rock which was introduced as a pirate ship somehow inland, the polar bear, the horse, Locke's recovery and on and on. It literally feels like the creator's are going \\"let's just pile on a bunch of really cool stuff\\" then realizing \\"uh oh, we have WAY too much stuff to answer\\". Sure it's compelling but let's get some answers in here. <br /> <br />While it's not a knock against the show, I'm starting to dislike the \\"stacked\\" style of packaging where one disc is below the other. It makes it very irritating when you want the bottom one, since you have to take top one off, take out bottom and put it in, figure out a place for disc 1, take out disc 2 and put it back in then disc 1 again. I much prefer Firefly, Buffy, Roswell and the newer versions of the X-Files which had them in separate cases. Hopefully the stacked style doesn't become as popular. <br /> <br />It is as awesome as season 1? Well, kinda. But is it compelling TV? Holy hell it sure is.
B00005NTJK|5.0|This album, released by Tull in 1970, surely still has much to say. Although it was overshadowed by the more commercially successful Aqualung and Thick as a Brick albums, this is still one of band's most satisfying recordings. If you think their first great album was Aqualung, then you must buy this cd and you will be blown away. I have always loved the way this cd sounds, very full and textured, much better than the Aqualung recording ever did, even after being digitally remastered. On this cd appear prominent themes in Ian Anderson's songwriting, especially aging, which he explored again on Too Old to RockN Roll, too Young to Die. Here also is the unique blend of accoustic/electric guitars and flute that would define Tull's sound for the next decade. The bonus tracks are also worth a listen, especially \\"Singing all Day\\" and \\"just trying to be\\" which I had not heard before. This album marked great strides in the development of Jethro Tull's musical prowess and hinted at their musical brilliance that would continue throughout the 1970s.
B000EULJLU|5.0|It's just amazing how much these guys are the total package musically. While each one of them is a gifted musician, they take those gifts and focus it into the song. It's interesting to read other reviewers compare this album to their other albums. I'd be willing to bet that everyone didn't fall in love with Aenima after the first 30 listens. Each one of thier albums takes time to get used to and to fully appreciate.  <br />The next one will be as great as all the others.
076531178X|5.0|I very much liked his first book \\"Elantris\\" but I think this one was even better. I Would rate Sanderson amoung my top five favorite fantasy authors now.  This book was hard to put down from start to finish and I didn't get a lot of other thinks done I needed to until I finished the book. If you like fantasy, it would be hard for me to not imagine you enjoying this book.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|I originally watched this on Encore Indie and it touched me in a way only a few movies or stories ever do. The subject matter could have become tawdry if not handled well, which it was. All the characters had their place, even the American who offered Charles an option of a place to go, to be free of all the pretense and obligation of his life, being also a main theme of the story, obligation and responsibility, as well as the desire to break free of them.  And watch it several times, the nuances that come out are amazing and also listen to the background talk, some interesting facts come out which help you understand the characters and stories even more.  I actually watch it with headphones on to hear all the conversations going on.  And Charles, watch his facial expressions, they are absolutely priceless and perfect. My father actually sat and watched it, and trust me he's a ESPN guy, not romance movies. Anyway, it was just amazingly beautiful and passionate.
B00005JNS0|5.0|A lovely movie that leaves the kids with a beautiful life lesson and big time entertaining for the whole family. Main character is Lightning McQueen, a beautiful little spoiled racing car too vain of his own early success to see beyond his own unexperience. Too proud and sure of himself to rely on others' advice, and believing that he would never be in need of anyone else. When he accidentally falls off the truck that was taking him to California to participate in the Piston Racing Coup, he finds himself on his own in an unknown place. Lost and alone he gets to Radiator Springs, a long-ago forgotten community struggling to stay in business nevertheless no big roads or highways pass nearby. A bunch of colorful guys there, with engines and parts perhaps not so brand-new and shiny but with certainly far more experience will eventually make him value all those meaningful and important things that go far beyond the mere outside looks and efervescent success: friendship, companionship, experience, and love.   ...And plus: what a soundtrack! Rascal Flatts' version of \\"Life is a highway\\" got me rocking all the way home after the movie theater... These guys are just purely and plainly great and make unbelievable music, even when remaking a new version of this famous 80's tune. I love them. Sheryl Crow's \\"Real Gone\\" opening theme rocks! The rest of the soundtrack is just as great combining classic tunes by Chuck Berry and James Taylor with performances by Brad Paisley, John Mayer and others. My advice: buy the movie DVD along with the soundtrack CD! You won't regret it.
B000G759LW|5.0|Christina's new album is absolutly amazing. She uses her powerful vocals to showcase the old school influences on this album. Both discs go perfectly with her new sexy-glam image.  <br /> <br />Some standouts on this album include: <br />\\"Save Me From Myself\\"---on this track Christina tones down her normally powerhouse vocals and the result is an absolutly gorgeous and vulnerable track. It shows off another side to Christina's voice.  <br /> <br />\\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\"---This is a very sexy, bluesy track. Christina show's off a sex-kittenish tone of her voice. It definitely still shows off her vocals, but it leaves you feeling the sensuality of the song. <br /> <br />\\"The Right Man\\"---The emotional intensity of this song for Christina is clearly shown through the vocals and the lyrics. Fantastic ending to the album and one of my favorite songs.  <br /> <br />\\"I Got Trouble\\"---Definitely has the old school sound. Great lyrics and sound. Another standout track! <br /> <br />\\"Oh Mother\\"---Christina praises the strength of her mother to get out of the abusive relationship she went through with Christina's father. Very emotional.  <br /> <br />\\"Hurt\\"---This song has great lyrics and shows off the full range and power of Christina's voice. This is slated to be Christina's second single from this album.  <br /> <br />\\"Welcome\\"---This song has a very dramatic circus/theatre sound. The drama of this song perfectly suits Christina's voice.  <br /> <br />All the songs on this album are great, but the above tracks were definitely standouts with a fantastic sound. Christina has reinvented herself again, affirming the extent of her talent in the mind of everyone who hears her latest work. Amazing album!!!!
0767903862|5.0|This book is simply fantastic.  Recommended to me by a friend, I got introduced to Mr. Bryson's writing four years ago.  This was the first of his novels I read and it is, after reading them all, my favorite.  His writing style is easy to read, and the books, packed with well-researched facts, are informative without being boring.  Several years after reading this novel, I set off Down Under armed with a map, walking shoes, and In A Sunburned Country, dog-eared and highlighted.  It was a great guide, and re-reading some of his reflections about the places that I was now standing before was such a treat.   <br />  I sincerely promise that if you have a sense of humor, adventure, and curiosity about the world, you'll love this book.
0451197968|3.0|Years before reality tv was even thought of by television companies, Stephen King presented the idea (writing under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman) as being a mass-opiate to the public.  Set in a dystopia future in 2025, THE RUNNING MAN revolves around Ben Richards, a down-an-out common worker who can't get a job because he won't fit into the system.  Being unemployed and practically unhirable, Richards' 18-month-old-baby-girl begins suffering from a chronic cough and he and his wife have no way to pay for medicine.  Knowing that his child will die unless she gets the medicine she needs, Richards registers and enters himself in the Free-Vee games. People can win lots of money on these reality shows, but they're also highly dangerous and usually lethal.  Richards knows he's not old enough for Treadmill to Bucks, so he hopes for a shot at a show like Swim the Crocodiles.  Instead, Richards finds himself selected for the biggest money show of them all, The Running Man.  Presented to the public as a wretched criminal, Richards is released into the public.  For every hour he stays alive, he earns money.  If he can stay alive without being caught for a predetermined amount of time, he'll win a life of luxury.  The catch is, no one has ever survived--everyone is eventually hunted within a few days.  But, Richards is a man living not for himself and every moment he's alive gives his baby girl a better chance of surviving.<br /><br />THE RUNNING MAN is a very tight and action-based book.  It fits more into the genre of science fiction than the horror/suspense that King is usually known.  However, except for the motivation of Ben Richards, the book lacks any characterization that King writes so well.  The book is a quick read, but not as fulfilling.  Also, in the post-9/11 world we live in some people may have concerns about the novel's ending.  I, however, enjoyed THE RUNNING MAN, but didn't find it as fulfilling as much of King's other works.
B00006I53S|4.0|I bought this lens with a Canon 30D.  I am amazed of the quality of the pictures I can get inside with very little light.  I use a very high speed IOS setting (1600), but the image stabilization (IS) really helps in getting those sharper pictures. I recently took photos of my in-laws 50th and the quality was great with just the normal lights of a church.  I have experimented numerous times with the IS function on and off, and you definitely see the difference.  It is surely worth an extra couple of f-stops.  It of course does not have the quality of a Canon L lens, but the IS function really makes up for the speed of the lens.  One thing I was a little disappointment with is how loose the inner part of the zoom is as to the external tube.  I did like the IS function so much that I have also ordered the Canon 70-300mm IS lens also.  I would highly recommend this lens to anyone tat needs to shot in low light without a tripod.  I only knocked one star off for the quality of the fit of the inner and outer tubes, otherwise it is a great lens.
0393327655|4.0|I recommend this book, but not one to take to the beach for extra-light reading.  It would be nearly impossible to find a reader who would not disagree with something Sam Harris comes up with, and I think this adds to the appeal.  Anyone tackling this book will find many passages which seem at first to be either absurd, against common sense, or just plain odd.  The \\"end of faith\\" part is not too surprising, but the \\"future of reason\\" was clearly different than I would have expected. Clearly the author is challenging the reader to shout \\"what?!\\" occasionally, and that is easy to appreciate.      My immediate disagreements were the many \\"throw-away lines\\" tossed here and there about alchemists, Kyoto Protocol, Cambodia, and many more.  I discount these remarks as simply those not in his field of expertise - sort of like Dr. Linus Pauling and vitamin C. The most difficult thing about Faith for me was those 50-caliber end notes.  Since I prefer end notes to consist only of references, I do not like having to flip back and forth from the main text to the end of the book to see if there is important material to read at the end.  One of the end notes was longer than a page!  It was interesting and informative, but I do really wish that the darned thing had been put with the main text, maybe even as a side box or something.     Still, my proof of recommendation is that I intend to reread this before the end of the year.  It's worth it.
B000301YY8|5.0|James Blunt debut album was \\"Back To Bedlam\\" (2004). I recently got the chance to check this one out and I was highly impressed.  \\"You're Beautiful\\" got a lot of Radio play where I live, and I have never gotten tired of listening to this smooth ballad (which also has a highly unknown Hip Hop Remix). People I know generally tend to love this one or hate it! - I personally find Blunt's singing to be soulful and memorable. The album's first track & single is \\"High\\", an upbeat rock soul cut, where Blunt appreciates the early morning dawn, talks to a love and provides a powerful opener. \\"Wisemen\\" is another solid single while the sad \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" is a very powerful track where Blunt reminisces and says goodbye to a past love who has moved on. Blunt continues to sing with passion on tracks like \\"Tears and Rain\\" and \\"Out Of My Mind\\", while \\"So Long Jimmy\\" is a dedication to Jimmy Hendrix and Jim Morrison. I love the instrumentals to \\"Cry\\", while Blunt's lyrics and singing about War is on point on the closer \\"No Bravery\\". Reading some of the other reviews, I see people bashing this for being \\"sappy\\", or hating it from overplay - while everyone is entitled to their opinion I don't agree. I see Blunt as someone who values life, based upon his own life and soldier experiences.  \\"Back To Bedlam\\" is an album I recommend for the collection.
B000002MJC|5.0|This is the only Depeche Mode CD I own.  I do like other songs of theirs, especially the new one Precious, but this is the only album that I like every single song.
B000H7JD4A|4.0|Iron Maiden has always been one of the most respected and influential bands in heavy metal history and this effort continues that tradition.<br /><br />Some have said there's been a decided lack of fire and creativity in their studio work for at least the last decade or so even after Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith rejoined the fold. To that I say, what are you listening to? Paschendale  off Dance Of Death was probably Maiden's best tune in years if not their best tune ever! Maiden have a certain sound, always have, always will. So don't expect anything new or ground breaking here.<br /><br />This sounds like a typical Maiden release with more of a live feel to it than a polished studio mix. The guitars have always been a little thin sounding and Steve Harris's chattering fret noise/pickup clatter (trade mark sound?) is always present. Maiden's records have never had a heavy thick guitar tone to them and this continues in that vain. This has always been a sore point for me with Iron Maiden releases and well, nothings changed.<br /><br />The band does get good marks for maintaining a high standard as far as individual talent/parts go as the musicianship is again top notch.<br /><br />Their are no hits/memorable tunes here, no 2 Minutes To Midnight or Wrathchild etc. What we here is a cd that contains solid songs from start to finish. This has to be Iron Maiden's best overall cd in sometime despite the fact it has no outstanding songs. How is that possible?, well it's because the songs that are present are all very good, just not outstanding. Their are no filler tunes here just as their are no big hits so to speak. It just has something about it that was perhaps missing in the last few releases.<br /><br />It's a very good offering from the boys as Bruce likes to say and I for one am happy Maiden hasn't changed what they do one bit over the years.<br /><br />Now if they could just fix the mix?, it would be a perfect score.<br /><br />UP THE IRONS!!
B0002858YS|4.0|I am having a terrible time justifying to myself why I like this album so much. Brandon Flowers' adequate voice cannot hold more than about 4 notes. There are way too many tracks invoking flaky-sounding hipsters who may or may not be superstars or alternatively, may or may not be dead.  <br />  <br />But I can't get the thing out of my head.  <br />  <br />I like Hot Fuss for more than the fact that it happens to be sandwiched between Hole and The Kills at the office.  The opener \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine\\" immediately grabs your ear with Mark Stoermer's melodic and distinct bass work high up on the fretboard, consistently infusing the album with a sense of exuberance, and is quickly joined by Flowers' simple but effective synth work.  <br />   <br />It's funny how the tracks that first grab you on a CD can become the most tedious - \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" stood out for me at first but has since given way (perhaps thanks to the gospel choir and scarily obvious chorus) to sticking \\"Change Your Mind\\" and \\"Believe Me Natalie\\" on endless repeat, which has probably skewed my last.fm beyond repair.  <br /> <br />And then there's \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" the gender-bending piece of ear candy that has always made me want to get off my lazy rear and dance along. I plan to make a very entertaining evening in a karaoke bar with this.  <br />  <br />Upon repeated listens in the car stereo, the album falters in the slower songs, where Flowers' effects-laden vocals veer painfully off key at times. I'm still singing along. The closing track \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\" steals a line from the Cure and breaks down rather enjoyably into the second side of Abbey Road, but I can't help but believe the guy.  <br /> <br />Hot Fuss is an entertaining antidote to an increasingly polarized definition of \\"alternative.\\" The Killers are not the saviors of rock and roll, but they're a hell of a lot of fun.
B000E6FSPW|3.0|Ok, let me start by defeating some of the claims against this release.  It's not as \\"different\\" as the reviews make it out to be.  In fact, most of the \\"differences\\" are improvements.  First and foremost, the remastering improves the sound noticably but is not overdone.  To give a fair review, here's a track by track comparison of this remastered version to the original. <br /> <br />1. Burning Heart (Same) <br />2. Hearts On Fire (Same) <br />3. Double Or Nothing (Intro has been fixed) <br />4. Eye Of The Tiger (Plays 17 seconds longer!) <br />5. War (Same) <br />6. Living In America (Intro has been fixed) <br />7. No Easy Way Out (Same) <br />8. One Way Street (Same) <br />9. The Sweetest Victory (The only major difference, this song has been entirely remixed - it's not better or worse to me, just different) <br />10. Training Montage (Same) <br />11. Man Against The World (Bonus track, cut from film and not on original release of soundtrack) <br /> <br />There you have it, that's the run down.  While I personally love this new remastered edition, the CD loses one star for not including the original mix of The Sweetest Victory and another star for not including more of the films music, such as Apollo's Death and the extended version of Heart's On Fire.  A five star tracklist would have included everything on the original release PLUS Man Against The World, Heart's On Fire (Extended) and Sweetest Victory (Remix) and the other neglectic music all as bonus material.
B000002WYT|5.0|It's very rare when a work of art this good comes to an artist in top form and he finds all the other peices of the puzzle to make an album this interesting, creative, free-flowing, and well, for lack of a better term, this kickin!  I would rate this album in the top 5 rock and/or jazz albums of all time, right up there with Rush's \\"Hemispheres\\" and Marillion's \\"Misplaced Childhood.\\"  If you want to hear superb musicians in their prime, this is the album for you, bar none. It's no wonder they couldn't maintain such a level, and their next two albums paled in comparison.  Believe Dave when he proclaims at the end of a particularly jammin tune, \\"That! Is bad as s**t!\\"  Oh yeah...
B000EHRVP6|5.0|I enjoyed this movie in the theater. My husband and I went on opening night, the police were at the doors of the theater, carding the young folks, so it added to the thrill. Our showing was packed, but everyone was silent, especially when the killing began. Just when I thought I could handle no more torture, the movie changed pace. The mood in our theater went from silent to CRAZY! People cheering and screaming, it was awesome. So, I did, very much, enjoy this movie, and will DEFINITELY be at opening night of Hostel 2- Can't Wait!! <br /> <br />The real gem, however, is Hostel \\"Dissected\\". I LOVED the behind the scenes look at these guys and gals, having a blast,making a horror flick! To hear that the men in the factory were actually teachers from a school nearby, to see Eli Roth washing his hands and checking his throat after shaking hands with the sick props guy, to see everyone dry-heaving at the smell of all the pig/cow/blood/parts- we were able to feel the FUN that these people had making this movie. People want to focus on the sickness, torture, gore of this film- But if you love horror movies, it tops my list. If you like behind the scenes making of horror movies, another excellent one is \\"30 Days in Hell\\" from The Devil's Rejects, Awesome!
0060512806|1.0|When this book came out, quite a few of the people I knew in the hacker community were reading this book.  I'd read that he was from central Illinois where I was living. So I gave it a try.  This book is like a boring version of the lord of the rings where all the interesting content has been replaced by silliness (some people felt Tolkien was verbose... man, they never read Stephenson). I never finished it because it was SO TEDIOUS.  The scene containing a description of the hero eating Captain Crunch is a good example.  Even without having read the book, I think we can all agree that's really tedious.  Can't we?    Years later, I still recall a few of the scenes and some of the writing.  So \\"haunting\\" wouldn't be inappropriate. But I am as \\"haunted\\" by the horrific parts (e.g., the outcome of the WWII romance).  I wish there was a way to flush this book out of my memory.      Alas, all I can do is write this review.
B000002LQR|5.0|Other than the obvious hits; highlights include Power of Equality, If You Have to Ask, I could Have Lied, Righteous and the Wicked, Naked in the Rain and Sir Psycho Sexy. Frusciante begins to evolve and the band begins to break new ground (as they have continued to do over the years [it makes you wonder what if Hillel Slovak hadn't died]). Cool party vibe throughout the disc, not at all dark and melancholy like some of the the later albums. BSSM is an all around great album even 15 years later; other RHCP albums have been remastered, so why not this one?<br /><br />We miss you \\"Huckleberry\\", thank God for John :)
0812975219|5.0|The spotlighted reviews are unfair and irritating.  I enjoyed the hell out of this book, not because the author's thesis is necessarily correct, but because it is extremely entertaining and well-written.<br /><br />This is a brief literary essay about epistemology, not a textbook.  It tells the story of a philosopher who unintentionally stumbles into options trading, and presses his neuroses to his advantage.  It does not purport to be a handbook for success in the stock market.  Nor COULD it resolve the perennial debate between empiricism and rationalism.  Taleb does not \\"ignore\\" the possibility of deductive reasoning from a priori truth, he discounts it.  He's a empiricist, and this is an polemic for empiricism.  He's a partisan, not an ignoramus.<br /><br />I also disagree with the contention that Taleb spreads his \\"cultural comfiture\\" thin, though I am not at all surprised to learn that that is a French idiom.  As a TRUE sophisticate, I can vouch for the fact that this a culturally-sophisticated book, even if he gets the details of signal/noise filtration wrong on page 167.  Or whatever.  (Not caring much, I'll have to take his word on it.)<br /><br />I can understand why this book has hurt feelings, since the author adopts a cavalier and often snide tone toward those who have experienced success in the market.  But, come on here, it isn't as though he's picking on crippled children; his targets are high-risk traders - they should have thicker skins.  In any event, the streak of self-deprecation that runs through this book is obvious.  The author humorously portrays HIMSELF as a petty, jealous, greedy snob.  It's an ironic pose and -if your ego's not wrapped up in these things- it's pretty damn funny.<br /><br />There is a growing market for the philosophical business book.  Rather than panning Taleb's book, the critics above should write their own.  If anyone can explain \\"praxeological analysis\\" with the same style and grace that Taleb has brought to black swans, heuristics and biases, then I will eagerly buy their book, too.I will eagerly buy their book, too.
0679422714|1.0|Shameless lies all over. I don't know I should laugh at it or spit on the weird \\"stories\\" the authors made up in the book. <br /> <br />I noticed an interesting fact is that all chinese hate this fiction and all the ppl in states like it. O well.  That is why the shameless authors published this book to cuddle ppl in the west by making some clueless stories about Mao? And they must have made some big bucks.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000H7JD4K|5.0|A Matter of Life and Death finds Iron Maiden firing on all cyliders once again.  Picking up where Dance of Death left off, Steve Harris, Bruce Dickinson, Adrian Smith, Dave Murray, Janick Gers, and Nicko McBrain took their songwriting to the next level.<br /><br />A Matter of Life and Death features fully developed, sophisticated songs that have both power and melody.  Songs like \\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns,\\" and \\"The Longest Day,\\" match up against almost any song in Maiden's catalog, while others like \\"The Pilgrim\\" (with it's middle eastern flavored riffs), \\"These Colours Don't Run,\\" and \\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\" all give the album a cohesive feel.<br /><br />Much discussion has gone on regarding the album's magnum opus, \\"For The Greater Good of God,\\" and I won't repeat all of it here (I couldn't if I wanted to), but I will say this - it is a stunning track that the band should definitely be proud of.  It is pure Iron Maiden, with all the requisite changes and melodies (not to mention power and energy) of a great Maiden song, and Steve Harris has done one hell of a job writing this one all by himself.<br /><br />Special mention should be made regarding Nicko's drumming on the album.  This may be his best all around performance since his debut in Maiden with Piece of Mind!  He finds a groove on almost every song - including \\"Brigher Than a Thousand Suns,\\" which features a 7/4 verse!  His playing has both groove and flair, and he gives the album a little more life than it's two predecessors from a rhythmic standpoint.<br /><br />The production on AMOLAD is also a bit stronger than the last two albums - actually, I think it's their best produced album sonically since Powerslave.  Kevin Shirley has done a fantastic job on that count.  The one count against Shirley is that he doesn't seem to know how to stand up to Steve when he adds the mellow intros to some of the songs.<br /><br />While the intros on AMOLAD are better than the ones on the Maiden albums from the last 11 years, there are still a couple that we could do without - and more importantly that the songs could do without \\"Lord of Light,\\" and \\"Benjamin Breeg.\\"  Still, they do sound better than on recent albums, so that is a step in the right direction.<br /><br />Overall, while it's not a perfect album by any means, it is still an album of great depth and sophistication, and it is an album that grows on you with repeated listens.  Well worth the time and effort to familiarize yourself with all of it's changes and complexity, A Matter of Life and Death is an album that every Iron Maiden fan should own.he Maiden albums from the last 11 years, there are still a couple that we could do without - and more importantly that the songs could do without \\"Lord of Light,\\" and \\"Benjamin Breeg.\\"  Still, they do sound better than on recent albums, so that is a step in the right direction. <br /> <br />Overall, while it's not a perfect album by any means, it is still an album of great depth and sophistication, and it is an album that grows on you with repeated listens.

B000BFH2S2|1.0|I've been listening to Frank Sinatra for years, and this kind of stuff just leaves me cold - I'd rather here the man himself...<br /><br />Or, for a completely different take on the material, someone with a completely original approach like Shamus Dark, and his album \\"Songs For Suicidal Lovers\\", which sounds like nothing I've heard before, whilst staying true to the fantastic songs.

B00000I07R|5.0|KEEP THE FAITH is the first Bon Jovi album where the band turns serious, even as they maintain some of the old party-rock sound. The opening one-two inspirational punch of \\"I Believe\\" and the title track is great, and the epic \\"Dry County\\" is Bon Jovi's version of all of the long Southern rock songs of the 70s, which is not surprising considering that Jon Bon Jovi shares those bands' belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was unjustly convicted, which, along with his advocacy of increased funding for law enforcement, makes this album an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B000000H66|5.0|This album is incredibly dark twisting and complex. Ok so you listened to ITP and Human. Well don't let the names on the back of the cd booklet fool you, because besides Chuck and MephistoGene, i had never heard of these guys either. Doesn't matter. These guys are solid as can be. Best songs are Crystal Mountain and Empty Words. I mean, these are contenders for best Death song, especially Crystal Mountain. Plus the production is much better than ITP. Chuck knew what he was doing on this album. It would have been a fitting finale if not for SOP. Its that good. Buy it!
0307165485|5.0|I loved Richard Scarry when I was young. When I was 4 I got My first book the Bunny Book. I loved it, it was so cute. I got the best storybook for my son when he was 2. He's now 3 1/2 and i'm not kidding i've read this book to him every single day since! He loves it. He calls it the bunny book. Because he too loves that cute story. Sometimes i'll find him in his room just studying the pictures he can be there for a very long. This is a must for every childs library.  I also recommend the Richard Scarry's Best Learning videos from Rrandom House.  My son loves those as well.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Bob Dylan has been called a cultural icon, a voice of a generation and by his own admission, a song and dance man. After reading his brilliant memoir, Chronicles, we find he has little use for labels of any kind. With the new Modern Times, Dylan continues on by making music that can not be pigeonholed under a specific label. It's certainly not a pop or rock and roll CD, that's obvious. What the bard has done here is fuse blues based sensibilities with a hint of jazz and some down home country musings. Dylan fans are use to brilliant lyrics, so when he compares \\"sleep to a temporary death\\" we tend not to gasp with excitement; rather we shake our heads in disbelief that at 65 he still has some sting. What's fascinating after all of his work is his ability to write such melodic music. After just one listen, these melodies are still with me! Modern Times is the perfect antidote for the modern times in which we live. This will be filed under D for Dylan at your local retailer, but it belongs under B for BRILLIANT! I guess there is a label for him after all!
B0000TB03W|4.0|After 3 1/2 years off of pefroming in concert, Shania Twain returns to the concert stage to promote her Up! album, so that fall she spent time on the tour, and the first place she hits is Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois. And I live in a subrub of Chicago, and I go to Chicago as often as I can, and it is a really good city, and you should check out the town, if you ever come to Illinois, they put in a whole different bandtand for Shania to pefrom on, and since I am from Chicago, I know that there is another bandstand in Chicago that is there, 365 days a year, used or not called the Petrillio Music Shell, and it is not as nice as this one that we see her perfoming on in this concert, and that is why I bet they put it in Grant Park for. The songs are Man! I feel like a Woman!, Up!, Honey, I'm home, She's not just a pretty face, Forever and for always, Ka-Ching!, When you kiss me, Don't be stupid (you know I love you), That don't impress me much, I'm gonna getcha good!, From this moment on, No one needs to know, Thank you baby! (for making someday come so soon), It only hurts when I'm breathing, Juanita, Whose bed have your boots bee under?, Any man of mine, In my car (I'll be the driver), (If you're not in it for love), I'm outta here!, You're still the one, Nah!, Rock this country! Now you might not have to be a big Shania Twain fan to know just what a kind person she is, in this concert, she goes off the stage for a bit, and goes in the adiuence, and lets a couple of women sing along on She's not a pretty face. Also between the songs of Ka-Ching! and When you kiss me, she lets a guy from the aduaince come up on the stage, and she introuces him to the crowd, and then they bring his girlfriend out on stage, and Shania says she has no idea of what is going to happen, and then he gets out a ring in a little box, and it looks like she knows what is going to happen, he gets down on one knee, and aks her to marry him, and with the mircophone, she accpets. I bet this will beone night they will remember, and then she lets them dance when she sings When you kiss me. Also she brings up 3 girls from the aduiance as well, and lets them sing alone with her on I'm gonna getche good. And she even brings up a 2 guys that spells out her first name, in parts on thier chests. And also even through she doesn't play guitar when she sings, she does and has the mike on the stand for 2 songs. Also it is nice to see the skyline of Chicago seen in this concert, and some of the buildings that are in the area of where this concert is pefromed. All together the show is 1 hour and 45 minutes long, and I know that a lot of singers come to Chicago for concerts, both in and outdoors, and it would be nice to see more filmed concerts like this.
0812975219|3.0|As someone with a taste for statistical theory, this one was disappointing.  Taleb is constantly casting around for what exactly he wants to write about.  Yes, he passably develops his theory that people read far too much into random events.  He does this through a series of personal stories, which unto themselves are entertaining.  But, it's never clear if he's writing an autobiography or discussing randomness and I came away from this book no more enlightened about randomness than I had been before.  If you are a novice in the area and are looking for a light introduction on the subject, it's a good book.  If you're already familiar with the concept of randomness, don't bother.
B00008CLOA|5.0|The \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is one of the greatest musical contributions of the twentieth century. This truth makes a 5.1 surround sound release long overdue. While looking for a surround sound home theater, I was conscious of getting an SACD compatible unit so that I could specifically listen to this disc. I shopped around at a few stereo stores. None of the salesmen that I spoke with had even heard of SACD. After seeing no units identified as SACD compatible, I purchased a system and hoped for the best. As it turns out, no luck. This release will not play surround sound music in a regular DVD based surround sound theater. While there is supposed to be a format war between SACD and DVD-Audio, it seems that DVD-Audio is winning and SACD is quickly joining the fate of Beta video cassettes. With hindsight, DVD-Audio would have been a superior choice of technology for this 1973 classic.  The only way most of us will ever hear the \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" in surround sound is by listening to the live version on the \\"Pulse\\" DVD. That written, there's little loss since this hybrid disc plays like a regular CD. I am also baffled by the audio technician wannabee reviewers. To my ears, this disc sounds exactly like the existing audio releases. I'm sure this information is buried someplace within the 298 reviews. I didn't care to read through 50 pages of reviews for a single disc purchase and you probably don't either. Thus I thought I'd pass this along for those especially interested in the surround sound aspect of this release.
B00005JP5J|4.0|Darkiest comedy ever. Finally a movie that makes fun of those stupid pagent contests. I would have gave it five stars but there is too much cursing and adult things in there that I'd rather not see.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Want to hear big metal riffs with some guy wailing over them?  Get your balls right here people.  Would like you variety, artistry and a lack of annoying guitar solos?  Shop elsewhere.  I can enjoy this album for maybe 2 or 3 songs at a time.  Any more than that and I get bored.  Its a slow, deliberate album.  You get the impression of a AC/DC release with song tempos all hanging around each other.  Luckily, Cornell is screaming his head off.  The lyrics are vague but personal.  No high-minded musings of abstract gloominess on this one.  Okay, well maybe a few.  The band has some good riffs and groves but they seem to pull back -whatever that means.  I can say that some parts of the album will get the hair on your neck saluting.  I'd say about...4 instances of that.   <br /> <br />If you feel like hearing some big rock then pop this in.  Just keep a copy of SuperUnknown around so you can keep the vibe going after 2 or 3 tunes from these super troopers.  I wouldn't recommend listening to Evil Empire afterwards.  It will just make you realize how little the rage guys have changed musically.  They've used that riff on Cochise like 8 times now.    Did I mention the similarity to AC/DC?
0446677450|4.0|This book is a very strong and pratical read that will change your thinking towards economics and the power of a dollar. I was intrigued with Robert K.'s examples and conversational tone in the book. I would encourage this book to younger readers as well.
B000H7JD4K|3.0|I was really excited to hear this CD, but even after 5 listens I can't really get into it. Its too mellow/progressive for me, no monstrous riffs on this CD. I think its been a downward spiral since Brave New World for these heroes of mine!! Its very sad to see another average Maiden album where each song seems similar!! Buy if you're a Maidenhead only!!!
B000GIWS7E|5.0|This DVD is worth buying. DT with the Octavarium Orchestra...what a great show!
B000E6GBV2|5.0|I would hear a fantastic song on our local station KEXP (truly the greatest music station to ever exist) and after a couple more songs played, they would say that fantastic song was Band of Horses. This happened several times, then I saw them on Letterman and realized how incredible this band actually is. The vocals and echoey quality does sound a bit like My Morning Jacket. People have compared them to Neil Young (I don't really see it). Maybe a little of Flaming Lips thrown in. Possibly Arcade Fire. But they stand on their own. I can't listen to the CD enough. If you like dreamy, beautiful, well-crafted indie pop, or are just an open-minded music lover looking for something new and different, then buy the CD. I cannot imagine you'd be disappointed.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I love this CD. Which is a shocker. I can't stand blue grass, don't even like country. But the quality of singing voices and the immpeckable instrumental execution makes me an admirer. I bought this cd because I watched the movie and Goerge Clooney's 'singing' performance made me laugh. I smile alot when listening to this cd. Very well done.
B000002LUB|5.0|this has got to be, by far, some of the best material either Sabbath or Dio has ever released. a small part of me wants to say that this is better than Dio's 1st album with Sabbath \\"Heaven and Hell\\" but that record is too much of a classic to be outdone. Dehumanizer is by far the most overlooked album i've ever seen.<br /><br />Computer God: genious opener, great lyrics and vox by Dio and hard riffs by Iommi all the way through.<br /><br />After All (The Dead): this one took a few listens to truly appreciate. the harmonies in this one are great<br /><br />TV Crimes: the best song on the album bar none. it plain out rocks like no other with the heaviest, yet catchiest riffs i've heard on an album like this.<br /><br />Letters From Earth: more great and heavy riffs by Iommi. i prefer the rare alternate version of this song but the one that appears on the record here is still great.<br /><br />Master Of Insanity: still rockin', but not as much. it gets a bit repetitive but that only cuz the rest of the album is so good that even a good song like this looks bad compared to it.<br /><br />Time Machine: perhaps the most overlooked gem on this album, simply, its awesome<br /><br />Sins of the Father: a little less heavy but in a good way. good lyrics too.<br /><br />Too Late: the albums attempt at a \\"ballad\\". a good song but doesn't really fit in with all these other heavier songs<br /><br />I: my 2nd favorite song on the album. riffs are great, solo rules, and Dio's vocals are at their best here. plus its got genious lyrics.<br /><br />Buried Alive: haven't gotten into this one till recently. once again (i find myself saying this alot) very heavy and many different riffs here. i love it.<br /><br />Time Machine (Wayne's World Version): nothing real special here, but its neat that they put it on. worth listenin to once in a while.<br /><br />overall very awesome album. one of my top 5 favorites of all time. buy it now!!!
B00000055E|5.0|RU Still Down first posthumus 2pac album is my favorite one created after he died. Pacs vocals are not sped up and the production sounds like a 2pac album. I could list this whole album as the best songs but the standouts to me are RU Still Down, Hellrazor, Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto hip hop version, Open Fire, When I Get Free 1 and 2, Do For Love, F=== All Yall, well just forget it. Every song on here is a standout in my eyes. Pac's albums would go downhill from here.
0345440900|5.0|I cannot say enough about this book!  Tracy Hogg helps you through the moments you first bring home your newborn (and throughout the 1st year).  This was my favorite book!  My book has highlights all through it and you can tell it is a USED book.  My only recommendation for Tracy Hogg is to put out a workbook.  It would help with charts & save me a little time having to make up charts and trying to find them in the book.  All I can remember, (my son is now 23 months) is this book helped me keep my sanity and made me realize all moms go through the same things.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|All it takes is one single and Damian had that with Welcome To Jamrock.  When I first saw that video I knew I had to hear it again and then again and that sparked my interest in getting this album. I actually got it the first day it came out along with DJ Quik. Now I've listened to Bob Marley but I just know his main songs thanks to my moms. But I didnt expect this album to be that good.  Every song is classic but the standouts are the title track, Beautiful with Bobby Brown, Road to Zion, Pimpas Paradise, well lets just say every song is a standout. Every song has a message in it, just like his father's songs. Everyone should have this cd already, if you're into hip hop reggae. One of my favorite albums ever.
B0006IJ5PM|5.0|You can't fully appreciate what high school football means to a West Texas town unless you go there. The Odessa landscape reminds you of the moon, dry and desolate. The week drags on like purgatory, until Friday nights.  <br /> <br />\\"Friday Night Lights\\" realistically captures what day to day life is like where prep football is king, and everything else doesn't matter. High School football is in every pore of every person who lives there. Winning teams are treated like gods, until they lose. Then they're on you like a pack of wild dogs.  <br /> <br />This movie shows what it's like to live and die for the game. You see the unbelievable sacrifice that kids, parents, and coaches put up for this. You may tend to brush this aside as just a phase in teenage boys lives. It's much more than that.  <br /> <br />After the movie, be sure to watch the feature with the real players and coaches of the Permian Panthers. You'll see just how close reality and filmaking have come here. I came away from \\"Friday Night Lights\\" wishing I could have been there. And thanking God I wasn't.
B000H7JD4K|4.0|THE BAND: Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Steve Harris (bass & keyboards), Adrian Smith (lead & rhythm guitars), Dave Murray (lead & rhythm guitars), Janick Gers (lead & rhythm guitars), Nicko McBrain (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2006) 10 songs clocking in at just over 72 minutes. There are 2 versions of the release... 1. the standard disc, and 2. the \\"limited edition\\" release with a short DVD included (the DVD includes a 30 minute behind-the-scenes making of the album; \\"Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg\\" video; studio performance footage of \\"Different World\\"; and a Maiden photo gallery). Included with the disc is an 18-page booklet containing many band photos, song titles/credits, song lyrics, dates and tour stops on the '06 World Tour (most outside the U.S.), and thank you's. Steve Harris, as usual, had a hand in writing all tracks, and all band members (except McBrain) helped in co-writing duties on all songs. Recorded at Sarm West Studios, London. Cover art NOT by the long used Derek Riggs (but instead Tim Bradstreet & Grant Goleash). Label - Sanctuary.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\" (AMOLAD) starts off in the same fashion as their previous two releases - giving you a short 4 minute burst of in-yer-face metal (i.e. - \\"The Wicker Man\\" and \\"Wildest Dreams\\" from \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"Dance Of Death\\"). Track 1 - \\"Different World\\" (the 1st hit slated for release) gives you exactly the same feel... but doesn't leave you as exhausted as \\"The Wicker Man\\" did at the time. For me, it took 5 or 6 spins to really enjoy this disc. On first listen, the only thought that crossed my mind was... it's not as good as \\"Brave New World\\", but it's head and shoulders above \\"Dance Of Death\\". Songs/Melodies were better, and sound production was crisper. Most of the song lyrics lean toward war and religion. Most of Dickinson's vocals are trademark Maiden, but at times, I feel he's trying to fit too much in a particular verse. I have not been a fan of Janick Gers for some time (and do they really need 3 guitarists?), however I feel his song writing on this album shines... 2 great songs in \\"The Pilgrim\\" and the closer \\"The Legacy\\". Several of the songs have that \\"Somewhere In Time\\" (1986) progressive feel to them - with Harris' keyboards in the background (\\"These Colours Don't Run\\" in particular). Spin after spin, this album gets better the deeper you get into it. The last 4 tracks are the best (all 7 to 9 minutes in length)... the slow and heavy rocker \\"The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg\\" (with a mid section reminiscent of \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\"), \\"For The Greater Good Of God\\" (a Steve Harris penned song featuring some great bass guitar and questioning what is important in life), \\"Lord Of Light\\" (a great melody - outstanding guitar solos and I dig McBrain's drumming on this one), and \\"The Legacy\\" (a great 3 minute acoustic intro followed by a slow and heavy band entrance... simply a classic 9 minute Maiden epic journey). I rank \\"AMOLAD\\" in front \\"Dance Of Death\\" or anything else they released with replacement singer Bailey in the 90's. However, as good as this album may be, it's still not on par with any of their classic early 80's metal masterpieces (i.e. - \\"Number Of The Beast\\", \\"Piece Of Mind\\", \\"Powerslave\\"). The DVD is worthy as well for long time fans - showing some of what they went through in the studio - the good and the bad... great to see the band members making the music (and clowning around at the end doing an improvised unplugged version of ZZ Top's \\"Tush\\"). Also noted in the DVD is Dickinson and Harris agreeing to disagree - Harris thinks the melody is the key to a song, while Dickinson thinks the lyrics are most important. This album is absolutely essential to your Iron Maiden collection. Look for the limited edition with the bonus disc (4+ stars).Gers for some time (and do they really need 3 guitarists?), however I feel his song writing on this album shines... 2 great songs in \\"The Pilgrim\\" and the closer \\"The Legacy\\".

1592401791|5.0|I read this book with great interest. I am fascinated by the Beatles, and the critical roles that three other talented, open minded people (George Martin, Brian Epstein, Geoff Emerick) played to make them a success beyond anyone's imagination. <br /> <br />This book is focused on Geoff Emerick, a young audio engineer who played a crucial role in translating the Beatle's and George Martin's artistic vision into reality. This book is at its best when it talks about the recording techniques that Geoff invented to try to create sounds that mirrored the music's intent. Most of these techniques are now standard practice, but at the time, they were not only unheard of, they were against the policy of the studio, and were grounds for being fired. <br /> <br />It is that spirit of ignoring the rules and keeping your mind open that really leaps off the page, and who could argue with the results, especially listening to Revolver and Sgt. Pepper. <br /> <br />Just the discussion about how \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was put together was wonderful and evocative - I felt like I could really imagine how it must have been to hear that piece come together - an unprecedented recording for the times, and still quite amazing.  <br /> <br />Where the book fell a little flat for me were those times where Geoff went from relating factual stories and observations to making assumptions about people's inner lives and motivations. That's always tricky ground, and I think it diminished his credibility a little bit.  I was surprised to read some of his characterizations, and while they could be absolutely correct, I think it would have been better just to report what he observed, and let the reader draw his or her own conclusions. <br /> <br />Still, Geoff bore witness to a revolution in pop music and pioneered modern recording, all at the same time! I couldn't put the book down.
B000002IFP|5.0|The most memorable song from this 1989 release is the awesome soulful cover of IF YOU DON'T KNOW ME BY NOW,made famous by Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes in 1972. This album,like Simply Red's 1985 debut PICTURE BOOK,was released on Elektra thus their labelmates being Motley Crue,Anita Baker and The Georgia Satellites. The other songs are good and I give the credit to frontman Mick Hucknall,a vocal clone of Jefferson Airplane/Starship's Marty Balin.
B00078XKDE|5.0|The parallels to early PJ Harvey (and White Stripes) are on cue.  If you like minimalist crunchy/bluesy rock with punk undertones, especially with searing female vocals, then this is the band for you. The music of Chrissie Hynde, Kim Deal, and Joan Jett also come to mind. The Kills aren't mimicking these greats, they are unquestionably unique, but they have definitely tapped into the same incredible sound.  <br /> <br />The Kills are like eating 90% cocoa chocolate - not much sugar or cream, but overpoweringly dark and delicious.  Not everybody has the taste for it, but those who do will love this. <br /> <br />
B000B0WO0I|5.0|Simply Red goes easy listening on this album. Every track is either a re-recording or the original master minus percussion. We hear a piano plus a string ensemble on many of these tracks. This is an ideal album for easy listening music fans,especially senior citizens who can't stand the sound of hard rock or heavy metal. Marty Balin clone Mick Hucknall,the band's frontman gives fans a nice collection of hit songs in subtle form.
B00006JDVV|3.0|So, first of all, let's just discuss what this movie is about: Dragons. Okay, now, we can build on that.<br /><br />Basically dragons rise up again and take over the world, burning everything to ash. (We learn this from newspaper articles and even a TIME magazine cover shown during the movie... let's not even question these things... I mean when the world is being destroyed by dragons, you still have to print stories for TIME magazine and distribute them around the world, right?).<br /><br />In a castle in the middle of England Christian Bale oversees the supposed \\"last\\" group of humans on the Earth. They are bent on simply surviving, until a group of American militia-men, led by Matthew McConaughey arrive at their doors claiming to be dragon-slayers.<br /><br />I won't talk about the plot past that, except to say that it's a bit melodramatic and takes itself a *little* too seriously. But, hey, it's a movie about dragons.<br /><br />Christian Bale shows that he's truly a great actor by somehow rising above the B-movie script and turning in a believable performance, the rest of the cast doesn't fare as well. McConaughey the least... I don't know where his character is coming from. The gym, I'm guessing. He definitely worked out for the role.<br /><br />This movie's not boring, but it's not overly exciting either. Check it out if you want to get into a movie and laugh at it at the same time. It's a cut above a B movie, but a cut below a real movie. You'll probably enjoy it, but you won't even know why.
0440238609|5.0|I just finished reading this grand trilogy to my kids, aged 8, 10, and 12.  My wife ended up sitting in on almost the entire series, and all of us were riveted from Oxford to the World of the Dead and back again.  These books are incredibly ambitious: they set out to stitch together a religio-political history of the multiverse with deep, informed reference to physics, religious history, adolescent psychology, Nietzschean heroism, etc. etc. etc.  The result, as I read it, is one of the most compelling indictments of church and state ever written for a broad audience.  Author Philip Pullman concludes, without didactic hamfistedness, that the first purpose of churches and governments is self-perpetuation through maintaining the ignorance of their adherents and citizens.  The greatest wisdom and joy, in Pullman's worlds, comes of full, mortal, bodily engagement with the physical world per se: with domestic comforts, food, sex, art, aesthetic involvement, work well done, craft, cleverness, etc.  The well-earned consciousness of a human adult, earned through Blakean experience, is the crowning moment of all creation.  Antithetical to this wisdom and consciousness is dogmatic narowness, asceticism, monasticism, self-denial, narrowness of experience.<br /><br />That this idea is dramatized through the adventure stories of children is remarkable.  One could do worse than to say that the weakness of fictional biography is its narrowness, its dependence on the particular, the local, the kind of detail that is very difficult to universalize or even generalize.  And the weakness of allegory is its didactic tendency, its broad-stroke enmity to personal meaningfulness except in the most abstract terms.  What Pullman has done is to weave a sharp, poignantly-rendered, intimate set of psychological dramas into grand, almost scriptural allegory.  As though Charles Dickens were setting Tiny Tim against the backdrop of the Old Testament. In this way, which should not be attempted by lesser writers, the touchingly naive and personal actions of a 12-year-old girl take on universal importance.  Every minor petulance, every petty preference, every whim shakes creation.  In this setting, in which cataclysm feels immanent and everything hangs in pre-apocalyptic balance, our little heroin's encounter with God himself feels simply a natural step in the narrative.  How Pullman pulls this off, I don't know.  By all rights this should be embarrassing, overblown stuff, but it isn't.  It is emotionally raw, heartbreaking, and lovely.  Just like life.<br /><br />I highly recommend these books for children with good vocabulary and their fixed-Daemon authority figures.riters, the touchingly naive and personal actions of a 12-year-old girl take on universal importance.

B0000DJZAH|5.0|I was so blind-sided by this reissue - really. I have looked at this for a few years now, but I never picked it up. My impression of this was that it had some very good music along with some dated sounding tracks, so it wasn't a high priority. I'd been having very good luck buying hybrid SACD's even though I don't own a SACD player; the CD layers benefit greatly from the DSD mastering, making them stand head and shoulders above the latest PCM remasters (there are a few exceptions), so I decided to take the plunge.<br /><br />The CD layer is stunning. I must have been sitting there with my mouth open after \\"Overture\\" began. I experienced emotion that wasn't there on previous listens to this on CD and vinyl. Yes, some of the tracks still sound dated, but most of this album is very good indeed, and this remaster is so incredible. If you own a great stereo rig, I highly recommend buying this - in fact, even if you don't have a great rig, I recommend it!
B000C65Z1G|4.0|The Constant Gardener is an interesting case of strong direction and performances managing to paper over plot holes and some serious lapses in credibility. It's hard to imagine the two central characters ever finding themselves together anywhere but in a writer's wishful thinking, and the investigation into drugs' companies faking trials in Africa relies perhaps too heavily on slips of the tongue or the odd incriminating document or conversation, yet between the edgy but genuinely energetic direction, the better performances and the subject matter, it's surprisingly powerful and involving and definitely one of the best John Le Carre adaptations. Perfectly cast, Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz's limitations work for the roles for once: his awkward, half-apologetic shtick and her over-zealous head girl act are as right here as they are irritating in too many other films. Not all the casting or performances are as good, however, with Bill Nighy showing again why he's better in light comedy than in straight drama. Danny Huston shows some awkward beginnings before overcoming them and fully inhabiting his pathetic role as a spineless lovestruck embassy official - the accent seems a little too affected at first before wearing in. Well worth investigating.
B000005JA8|5.0|I can understand why the people that \\"don't get it\\" would be angry at all the critical accolades this album has garnered.  I think the \\"Beefheart as Picasso\\" theory holds true and has been covered in depth here.  All that I can add is on a personal note.  When I first heard this in the mid-seventies, it changed my outlook on music and poetry like no other work. I own close to 3000 CDs and LPs from every genre (except disco); I love the standards yet seek out the bizarre as well.  When I first heard this as a kid, I had no concept of what music reviewers said, good or bad, but i was drawn to it like a rubbernecker ogling a fatal wreck. Years later, after many listens, and after learning the backstory, I have come to respect Beefheart's work and am drawn in by its originality and catchiness. I am comforted by it as I replay the hooks and tonalities in my head. Finally, to dispell the theory that Zappa's production wrongfully inflated the merit of this album, I have two things to say: \\"An Evening With Wildman Fischer\\" and \\"the GTOs\\".  Now how do you like those particular apples?
0440237688|5.0|This book should be manditory reading in every school in the country. Not only is the story gripping, especially after you figure out what is going on, but the questions it raises are extremely thought-provoking. This book explores some of the great issues of what it means to be human - emotion, choice, free will, pain, and many other topics. She explores questions such as \\"what does it mean to have free will?\\" and \\"what does it mean to make individual choices?\\" Also explored are ideas such as abortion, euthanasia, collectivism vs. individualism, utopia, etc. Not only a gripping novel, but an extremely timely one as well. If you haven't read this book yet, please do so; you won't regret it. It is both entertaining and challenging, and has forced me to examine many issues in a more critical way. This book may change your thinking and will definitly challenge you in many key areas.
B00000DGUG|1.0|However, that's not what I'm here to discuss. I am here to confront a song I heard on WSHE 100.3 in Orlando, and this was around Sept./Oct. 1998. I know it was from this album, and it was the ending of the song, and she sang about \\"Arse\\", and then does a harmonica solo. I've narrowed it down to 2 songs, and they are: \\"That I Would Be Good\\", and \\"UR\\". I use the word \\"Arse\\" because if I used the real word she sings this review will never be posted. Anyway the rest of this album is all over the place. It starts off with a pretty good song called \\"Front Row\\" which is a rather strong dance tune, but then it gel into hard rock sludge with \\"Baba\\", and from there it just seems to run the gauntlet. It was just alot of spitting in the wind as far as I'm concerned, and to me there has to be a better reason to visit India.
B000099T2L|1.0|Her single \\"Crazy in Love\\" is really fantastic, I love that track, \\"Naughty Girl\\" is a great song too. The rest of the CD. Crap, I wish it had more songs like those 2 singles. Painful to listen to it.
B000002HFU|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of ODB but I love Wu Tang So I eventually gave this album a try.  First let me start off by saying there were only 2 or 3 tracks I was feeling, I donno it was pretty hard to get adjusted too for some reason.  The sound was wierd especially just hearing O.D.B without any back most of the time.  But Time went on and some day I just finally started getting into this album, so to make it sure unlike most wu albums it may take awhile for some maybe few to get into.  I was many people who at once though the rzarecta wasted some very precious beats on O.D.B(Like I was saying b4 i really wasnt diggin most of the album but as time went by i really started to appreciate it and started getting adjusted more to O.D.B crazy yet very profound lyrics).  Its not the best wu solo out there but it still deffenitley is a must have.  O.D.B rips the mic in some pretty dope songs and RZA backs it up with his usual crazy style of Kun Fu crazy wu tang banger beats. <br /> <br />1. Intro    <br />2. Shimmy Shimmy Ya - 10/10 c   <br />3. Baby C'mon - 9/10 <br />4. Brooklyn Zoo  - 10/10  <br />5. Hippa To Da Hoppa - 10/10 CLASSIC ODB TRACK  <br />6. Raw Hide - 8/10  <br />7. Damage  - 9.5/10 <br />8. Don't U Know - 8/10  <br />9. The Stomp  - 10/10 <br />10. Goin' Down -8/10  <br />11. Drunk Game - 7/10 <br />12. Snakes   - 9/10 <br />13. Brooklyn Zoo II - 8/10 <br />14. Proteck Ya Neck II The Zoo - 8/10  <br />15. Cuttin' Headz - 8/10  <br />16. Dirty Dancin' 7/10 <br />17. Harlem World - 7/10 <br /> <br />It has its ups and downs but no doubt a wu banger, pick this one up its probably odb's best and rza brings out his usual dope production. <br /> <br />Final Score <br />4.2/5
B000GRUMPU|1.0|I am a person that can easily be pleased. It does not take too much to satisfy me. I like many movies that many people hate. But this movie is garbage. The only thing worth watching was the rogue wave hitting the ship....everything else was average at best...nothing you havent seen in thousands of other movies before.  <br /> <br />Since I am a movie freak and can easily be pleased, saying this movie sucks is really saying something. Not only should I get a refund for this garbage DVD, I should be comopensated for time lost watching this garbage.....I would say about $300 would cover it.  <br /> <br />I wouldnt even want to recieve or give this as a gift. Anyone who attempts to give this DVD as a gift should be ashamed of themselves. A pack of gum would be a better gift.
B00080ZG10|5.0|The Aviator has been called the film in which Martin Scorsese went Hollywood, and surely its large, A-list cast makes it seem that way, but at its heart The Aviator has much more in common with both the big budget epics of the old studio days, and with Scorsese's classics such as Raging Bull and the more recent Gangs of New York. The Aviator is and will stand through time as an immense motion picture. Everything about it, from its subject matter to its scenes of flight and airliners resting in various stages of assembly in huge hangers displays an immensity of scale seldom seen in the movies or in life.<br /><br />Telling the story of the glory years of Howard Hughes from the 1920's to the 1940's, The Aviator displays once again that its star is much more than just another industry \\"it boy\\". Leonardo DiCaprio is a talented actor, and here he joins the select few (Val Kilmer in The Doors, Gary Busey in The Buddy Holly Story) who almost seem to become possessed by the figure they are portraying. DiCaprio nails the accent, appearance, and the idiosyncratic mannerisms of the tormented billionaire Hughes, and really should have taken home the Oscar last year, as did his co-star Cate Blanchett, whose respectful but never worshipful turn as Katharine Hepburn all but upstaged even DiCaprio.<br /><br />The Aviator reaches great heights and mixes in feel good moments with episodes of darkest despair. We root for the bizarre Howard Hughes and cheer him in his victories, even as we recoil and hate to look on as he falls into and the terrible living hell of mental illness. The most rousing scenes are of course the most dramatic, and the twin plane crashes should have anyone on the edge of his seat, just as Hughes' famous victory over Pan-Am's pocket Senator and his efforts to give that airline a monopoly on international flight make for a cheer-worthy climax to the film's nearly three-hour length.<br /><br />The Aviator shows a director working well with his star(s) and it demonstrates exactly how good American cinema can still be. It was fun to watch and makes a worthy addition to any collector's movie library.od American cinema can still be. It was fun to watch and makes a worthy addition to any collector's movie library.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Eyes Wide Shut was released in 1999 after Stanley Kubrick's death, and was misrepresented by well-meaning but misguided publicists as something resembling a non-stop orgy of sex, which it's simply not. If anything this mysterious film is the epitome of non-eroticism. So what is it? It is a somewhat quiet film about a human being suddenly cast into a self-authored but barely understood quest. It is about jealousy, sexual exploration, insecurity, love, lust, danger, and ultimately redemption and forgiveness. The sets Kubrick had designed and created, as he did in so many of his previous films, are astonishing in their scale and intricacy, and the soundtrack, such as it exists in this whisperingly still movie, hit exactly the right notes at the right moments, especially Jocelyn Pook's soul-stirring composition for the Black Mass scene at the exact center of this story. Eyes Wide Shut walks a thin line between metaphor and reality, wishful fantasy and actual happenings. How much of this story is real and how much takes place in the imagination of its central character, here played with unusual depth by Tom Cruise? I fall into the \\"it all happened\\" camp but I can certainly see how the reverse might be true.<br /><br />In Eyes Wide Shut, a handsome, successful young doctor, Bill Harford, finds the security of his comfortable life thrown askew when in the wake of a Christmas party in which he and his wife, played by Nicole Kidman, both interacted with strangers in a light, flirtatious manner, his wife reveals to him how close she once came to having an affair with a Naval officer. What follows next takes place primarily in the course of a single dream-like night as Harford leaves home to go to the deathbed of a long-time patient, and then rapidly plummets into a strange world of sexual promise and danger. Harford has a patient throw herself at him (no other description fits), encounters an attractive prostitute and allows himself to return---to an unforeseen outcome---with her to her flat, then he persuades an old friend, an itinerate musician, to let him to infiltrate a party at a lavish estate in the country, where the masked guests, presumably among New York's society elite, engage in unabashed sex acts amidst a setting reminiscent of the orgies of centuries past.<br /><br />In the aftermath of this life-altering night, Harford's self-confidence, in fact his very identity, is shaken to the core. He feels he has become embroiled in what was possibly a murder, for which he is to blame.  Far from being the confident, wealthy physician from the opening quarter of the movie, Harford is a desperate man who seeks out answers, all the while clearly terrified of the enlightenment those answers might bring. The soft world of the night becomes a harsh labyrinth of confusion as we again trail Harford, this time out into the daylight, where we share his desires to know more. Ultimately we must accept, as does Harford, the only answers he receives, satisfactory or not, and are glad when he embraces the closure he is given by both a friend and more unexpectedly, by his wife.<br /><br />Eyes Wide Shut is imperfect. A few of the acting performances fall short, and the spark of romance seems lacking between Cruise and Kidman (real life provided the answers for why) but when taken as a whole, this story, these visuals, the music, the intricate display of mastery of craft that is here in Eyes Wide Shut, all this combines to be a five-star production, and it is almost an all-time motion picture masterpiece.her flat, then he persuades an old friend, an itinerate musician, to let him to infiltrate a party at a lavish estate in the country, where the masked guests, presumably among New York's society elite, engage in unabashed sex acts amidst a setting reminiscent of the orgies of centuries past.

B00005JOFQ|2.0|I liked exactly two things about this, the single most over-rated motion picture to come down the pike since....I can't remember when. The first thing I liked was the beauty of the natural setting at the start of the movie when the couple at the heart of this story, Jack and Ennis, were atop Brokeback Mountain itself. The other was during the fireworks scene when Heath Ledger's character punched out the rude biker type who was cussing and being crude around his little girls. The rest of the film...well...<br /><br />I realize this is one of those stories where if you don't like it, you're instantly and with a closed-mind convicted of being a homophobe (such a convenient passive-aggressive term!) or unenlightened, or the ever-pat, \\"you just didn't get it.\\"  I disagree. I'd like to think I'm at least as enlightened as the next person out there and if I'm accused to failing to \\"get\\" Brokeback Mountain, then I'll turn the tables and say maybe a large portion of the audience was too ready to excuse too much here and proclaim its greatness for reasons other than its onscreen merits. Namely: \\"Hey, look at how cool I am, embracing this movie about homosexuality!\\"<br /><br />I suspect many hailed Brokeback Mountain as masterpiece because they felt its subject matter was somehow artsy, ground-breaking, and morally sophisticated. I'll leave those evaluations to others. All I know is I saw it from a neutral perspective and I did not like this film. I expected I'd at least come away seeing some sort of quality to it, but even that is largely lacking. Michelle Williams, who gave seven seasons worth of fine performances on Dawson's Creek was such a washed-out weakling here, it was almost unrecognizable that she possesses the acting talents she does. I realize both the lead actors are in reality heterosexual men, but even so, for supposedly portraying two souls deeply in love, I discerned no chemistry at all between them, only a coldness that made it clear they were just two actors playing parts: disbelief was not suspended, reality intruded into the plot. If anything, a good subtitle for these guys might've been \\"dumb and dumber\\". Kissing like they did in public, in plain sight of one of their wives, in town, and their boss up on Brokeback Mountain? And yet thinking they were keeping some sort of secret for twenty-whatever years? Am I alone in seeing that as...stupid?<br /><br />What really put me off was not the relationship between the men, adulterous though it was, it was the fact these supposedly sympathetic figures were complete and total jerks. Obviously they were miserable and wished to impose that misery on anyone close to them. They were terrible fathers, especially Ennis, who constantly and cruelly let his longsuffering daughter down, rotten (and unfaithful) husbands, and not even very good friends and lovers to one another. How anyone felt anything but alienation radiating from these two defies explanation. If this is the movie that was meant to be a groundbreaking ambassador for the gay community, I think gays are in trouble, because far from advancing the cause of that segment, surely this is a closet-embracing backset.elief was not suspended, reality intruded into the plot.

0380729407|4.0|Ray Bradbury's dark novel of a mysterious carnival that strolls one night into a quiet Midwestern town has attained a deserved classic status in the forty-some years since its unheralded release. Here Bradbury's oft-demonstrated gift for recalling the mindset of childhood and returning it however briefly to a reader, is in full bloom. Two thirteen-year-old boys, James Nightshade and William Halloway, each a sort of contrast of the other, exist as the heroes in this fable of good versus evil. In this book the weight of the desires of the human heart and the capacity of those desires to ensnare the soul (here, literally) merit the fullest exploration. Nowhere else in literature is a Mephistophelian bargain made so simplistically appealing, and it is a delight to see how Bradbury delivers his temptations like ripe red apples inwardly rotten to the core. And while thinking about the nature of evil, it seems certain constants have been there to bind the forces of ill in the genre of light versus darkness. One of these is that evil has universally stood revealed in the end. Can evil not hide itself? It seems it always gives its nature away. In this book at least Bradbury has the unmasking come in the form of the intuitive perspicacity of two small boys. I liked this enjoyable tale and I liked its characters, from the wickedly charismatic ringmaster Mr. Dark, to its peculiarly vulnerable wicked witch, to the custodian of the town library, Mr. Halloway, whose seemingly dull life is truly one of secret worlds opening to him each night amid the stacks of books. And what WOULD we each give, either now or one day, to be young all over again? Stop to think about that. And if not a return to youth, do we each have some secret desire for which we would do anything, or pay any price? Under the guise of a soft read, Something Wicked This Way Comes delves deep into humanity's consciousness, and explores what lies within.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|First off, I'm an 80's metal guy. I love bands like Metallica, Iron Maiden, Dio, Megadeth. And for years, it's been difficult for me to get into any new metal bands...until now! What an amazing band. Finally, you have a band that has the makings of a great modern day metal band, yet their music still firmly reflects their 80's roots. I love this album. If you love your metal with pounding riffs, killer solos, and a whole lot of attitude, buy this cd. This is the best British rock band to come onto the scene in years.
B000063DHL|5.0|This Album/CD is simply awesome the synth sound gave the album a nice sound, some depth, every song on this cd rocks, including the hit \\"Wasted Years\\" Adrian Smith is one of the most impressive guitarists in Metal, and this is his album, he shines on these songs!, Bruce sounds awesome as always, and the rest of the boys are right up to par!.<br /><br />No one made this type of Metal back in the 80's except maybe Judas Priest, this is one cd I never get tired of listening too!<br /><br />It's a \\"MUST HAVE\\" in any Maiden fans collection!<br /><br />Up The Irons !
B000066744|5.0|How did this terrific movie slip under the radar? <br /> <br />It's about the nature of art, the power of music, the mystery of friendship and love. Most of all, it's about how our fears prevent us from experiencing the immensity of life. <br /> <br />When was the last time you saw a movie tackle issues like this? <br /> <br />The widescreen production is ravishing to watch. It's rare to see an art house film executed with such first-class grandeur. The acting is also uniformly excellent. And the score is luscious. <br /> <br />If you liked THE PIANO or AMADEUS, prepare to be blown away.

It wasnt because i had no interest, its because it was presented in such a boring and dull way.<br /><br />With Head First Java, Java is taught in a fun way. A way that will keep your interest and improve retention so you can actually go program things when your done reading. I read this book in 3 days. And also prompted me to buy some of the other Head First books.<br /><br />Im excited about the Head first ALgebra book coming soon!<br /><br />If you want to learn Java fast and KNOW how to use it. Use this book.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Right off the bat, you need to understand that this movie is funny. It is far more funny than it is scary. Although I suppose that depends on what you consider scary.<br /><br />The jokes are great and range from the playground variety fart jokes to far more subtle and mind tweaking samples.<br /><br />So, mix a little horror with a lot of comedy and ... believe it or not ... a story that is more about breaking yourself out of the daily grind and discovering that the daily grind might have had its good points after all!<br /><br />It's about a world where folks stumble through their lives, zombie-like only to punctuate each beginning and ending of the day with some meaningless ritual - whether it's the pub, the tube or that damn game console! But in this story, everyone becomes the zombies they have been living like. You see there? Thats subtext.... just sit back and bask in its glow for a second. Done? Excellent... moving on.<br /><br />No matter what level of entertainment your looking for, your likely to find it here. Don't give a rats bottom about the underlying commentary the story makes on our day to day lives? They fuhgettaboutit and enjoy.
B000002WU9|5.0|The RZA is known for providing the perfect beat to fit each rapper he gives it to, and \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\" is the perfect example of the amazing chemistry between him and his Wu-Tang emcees. The beats and samples are all so perfect to fit with the styles of Rae and Ghost and each song flows so perfectly into the next that they seem to be like \\"part 2\\" of the song before it. <br /> <br />In the mid 90s, Rae was one of the best storytelling rappers (\\"the story tellin rap Magellan\\" as he puts it) around. Ghostface could kick a vicious battle rap any time he wants, and with those two elements combined over amazing production you get some of the best group work hip-hop has ever seen. <br /> <br />The album should be heard in its full context a few times through before you pick out songs, but the tracks that stand out on their own are \\"Verbal Intercourse\\" (with Nas, some say it's his best verse ever), \\"Wu-Gambinos\\" (Method Man comes off the hardest and the beat is grimy as hell), \\"Heaven & Hell\\" (perfect way to end the album and a great track on its own, appeared on a soundtrack as well), \\"Ice Cream\\", \\"Criminology\\" and \\"Incarcerated Scarfaces\\". <br /> <br />Amazing album. It's the best solo Wu-Tang album and easily one of the best of all time. 5 mics from the Source in 1995 should tell you that, but if you're just discovering this now it's something you definitely need to check out.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|I would LOVE to give this film an enthusiastic positive rating. Sadly, I can't. It is not as if it did not have TONS going for it. It can draw from a pretty rich story line of existing comics and animations and has an excellent cast. <br /> <br />I was a fan of the Aeon Flux animations back when they were on MTV. So, with memories of those running through my mind I purchsed the DVD before ever having seen the movie.  <br /> <br />When it was over, I just was not left impressed. It felt like a combination of things that left me so... well... unimpressed by the whole thing. For one, the pace of the movie felt very off. The editing can probably be blamed for much of what is wrong with this film. I am a big fan of Ms. Theron, but she played her character very distant - and she did not seem to be able to do this and keep you attentive. Just being the hottest female butt kicker in town is not enough. <br /> <br />The film is set in a far future where there are only a handful of us left in a walled \\"utopian\\" city. I suspect you won't be more than halfway through the film before you figure out \\"The Big Secret\\", but I don't have a particular problem with that. It's nice to have clues laid around for us to figure out. <br /> <br />It's not going to go down in the books as a defining moment in the science fiction movie making industry. If your a fan of the Aeon Flux world, this film may have more appeal for you. <br /> <br />If not, and you want an average sci fi flick with excellent production values but not so great editing, wait for the price to come down a few bucks.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|If you've been waiting to buy a contemporary Dylan album, but don't want to get stuck with a CD that only Dylan fans could love, your wait is over. Better than Time out of Mind, better than Love and Theft, MT is to my ears the best Dylan album in years. Too bad Dylan's voice is gone, as I would have liked to hear it with his old voice. Nevertheless, Dylans straining vocals are integral to these calm musings of an older and wiser songman. What really hooks you however is Dylan's backup band: efficient, competent, non-flashy and as good a group as Dylan has ever assembled since the years with the Band.  <br /> <br />The album sounds better each time I listen to it. The implicit meanings and fine shadings in Dylan's voice would be incredible in any artist, but that he pulls it off with his voice, as shot as it is, is amazing. Dylan sings behind the beat, in front of the beat and basically dances around every song in rythmn with whatever lyrical impulses are driving him at the moment. This might not work with a lesser band behind him, but his backup band is definitely along for the ride on these tracks.  <br /> <br />Dylans lyrics are really great on this album. The famed Dylan wit is in full evidence. By turns tender, funny, angry and romantic, Dylan covers the full litany of modern complaints from the macro to the micro. Thankfully he avoids the facile rhymes that have characterized some of his recent offerings, and concentrates on the phrase rather than the word. There are new things to discover each time out. I have had the CD on repeat now for several hours and am not tired of it yet.  <br /> <br />That the album is Grammy bound is unmistakeable. I think it's good enough to win Album of the Year. <br />
B0006L16N8|3.0|I bought this cd on a whim, not really being a huge Coldplay fan. I instantly liked \\"Square One\\", \\"Speed of Sound\\", \\"Talk\\", and \\"Permanent Stain\\". The U2-similarities intrigued me as I'm a fan of U2's music. I find that there's enough similarity between the two bands -- the slow, melodic starts to the sound, with a rushing, sweeping chorus -- and the way in which both singers sound, but also enough difference that you can tell them apart. <br /> <br />It took me awhile to discover \\"A Message\\", but when I did I instantly liked it and it became my favourite off the album. It's the most stripped down song, starting off acoustic, and gradually building up to ringing guitars ... very U2-esque a la \\"Staring at the Sun\\" and \\"Miracle Drug\\". <br /> <br />Indeed, it's the songs that focus more on the guitars and drums that are the best ones (with the exception of \\"White Shadow\\", which has a long keyboard intro). In between are a lot of slower, more keyboard/piano-driven songs, songs that personally bore me. Indeed, several of the best songs are on the second half of the disc, which overall seems a little more upbeat. <br /> <br />All in all this is a fairly decent album, but nothing to write home about. Some songs are really well-done and enjoyable to listen to; others are just plain boring. It's also annoying how no cd lyrics are printed in the cd jacket (at least in my version ... which is the special DVD version), as I like to have those to refer to. But that's a minor gripe. <br /> <br />The cd gets three stars because of the boring songs; if it were just an EP with half of the songs it would have been a winner.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|After the good, but dissappointing \\"Dance Of Death\\" offering, I admit to being a bit wary of this new one. Would the lads in Maiden continue a downward slide or ??!!!...Happy to report this baby rocks!!!!<br />They take quite a few chances on song structures and melodies on \\"Matter of...\\" with EXTREMELY satisfying results. This is a mature, thinking Maiden and its takes the listener on a multi-textured, complex journey.<br />Brilliantly written, performed and recorded, this record ranks up with the best of Maiden.<br />Of course, there will be lousy reviews here from folks that simply hate change, wanting Maiden to keep churning out \\"Powerslave\\" after \\"Powerslave\\" (the Maiden gallop) with little variation (kind of like Deadheads...), but pay them no mind. One listen to this one and you will be hooked.<br />Standout tracks right off the bat include: \\"Brighter Than A Thousand Sons\\", the sweeping- \\"Legacy\\", the amazing \\"Reincarnation of Ben Breeg\\" and the instantly humable \\"Different World\\" for this metalhead.<br />Make sure you get the Deluxe edition which includes an extra DVD featuring a great making of- film of the record, videos for \\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\", live studio \\"Different World\\", a photo gallery and cloth Maiden patch.<br />This record also is a welcome return to great Maiden cover art. (Is that Benjamin with the Thompson submachine gun on the top of the tank?)<br />My only regret is not with the record, but with the shorty 2006 fall tour which will not hit much of the U.S. (and not the Northwest)<br />Up The Irons!
0930289331|5.0|The Batman has proven to be one of the most interesting and resilient archetypes of American superheroes.  His humble beginnings as a 1930s comic book character dreamt up by young artist Bob Kane have led to many incarnations and retellings of his story in comic, live action, and animated form.  Some have been dark, some campy, most somewhere in between.  Here is a character that lends himself to many different interpretations. <br /> <br />Batman: Year One is the definite interpretation of Batman in comic book form, the perfect telling of the Batman mythos and its origin, in my mind.  Yes, it can be fun to see Batman as a campy, self-parodying character (Adam West in a batsuit), a team player among other superheroes (many incarnations of the Justice League), or a man at his grimmest extreme (Miller's more famous work, The Dark Knight Returns).  But here is a story that takes Batman back to the grim figure of the night, driven by the murder of his parents, that Bob Kane first envisioned and wrote. <br /> <br />Year One is often eclipsed by Miller's The Dark Knight Returns.  While the latter work has been undoubtedly more influential on comics as a whole, it is also an atypical portrait of Batman, one of the character taken to an extreme.  For Year One, Miller focuses instead on the core identity of the character. <br /> <br />The tale of Bruce Wayne's return to Gotham and debut as the Batman after twelve years of training abroad is juxtaposed with the tale of James Gordon, a newly-arrived cop in Gotham, who becomes one of the few good cops in a city full of corrupt men.  The juxtaposition works well: the two men have the same goal, just different ways of reaching it. <br /> <br />The story is dark, but not overwhelmingly so.  Batman fights no supervillains here  (though the story's sole misstep is introducing Selena Kyle, pre-Catwoman, in an unresolved subplot).  The police are as much his enemies as the city's crooks.  The characters are realistically drawn, rightdown to their very human failings.  This Batman has the skills to perform his mission, but not the experience.  This Gordon does his admirable best to make Gotham City a good place for his unborn child and wife, but finds himself strongly attracted to another women. <br /> <br />Praise must be given to artist David Mazzucchelli and colorist Richmond Lewis.  Mazzucchelli's sparse (but not minimalistic) art style and Lewis's muted hues complement the plot impeccably.  Even the lettering by Todd Klein shines, using subtly different fonts for the two protagonist's internal thoughts (a stylistic device now common in comics, replacing older telegraphic narration, but ahead of its time when this book was published). <br /> <br />Fans of Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins take note: this book is its spiritual inspiration.  Newcomers to comic books needn't fear: this book requires no foreknowledge of the characters.  And fans of fiction in general may well be suprised at how strong the book's literary merits are. <br /> <br />This is Batman as he's meant to be, as he should be.
0441172717|5.0|At first sight, Dune may be viewed as a classic that will just be called \\"The Best Sci-Fi Novel Ever Written\\" and that fact will prevent people from reading it, simply because they've heard \\"It's the best there is\\" and there's no reason to read it, they already know it's good. Not True! Until you've read Dune, Dune cannot be judged.  <br /> <br />  The story starts out with Duke Leto, the son of Duke Leto I, being forced to leave his home planet by the ambitious Emperor. Meanwhile, the Duke's son, Paul, trains his last lessons with his teachers, Yoeh, a doctor and wise man and his teacher in swordsmanship. As the tension grows, the Ducal family and their soldiers, servants and belongings move to the dessert planet, Arrakis (Dune), and settle into a new mansion.  <br /> <br />   Although, Thufir Hawat, the lead commanding officer in the Duke's army, and a mentat(A human trained for combat and has  supernatural intelligence)cleared the mansion as \\"Safe\\", there is a traitor amongst the family and soldiers. And one of the suspected is the Duke's advisor and the mother of Paul, Lady Jessica.  <br /> <br />Jessica, trained in the arts of the Bene Gesserit (A religious group that struggles for power over all the royal rulers) is considered a \\"witch\\" among some and capable of evil deeds. The story moves on to the tragic betrayal that would lead to the downfall of Duke Leto's house and the rise of the Baron, his own cousin. <br /> <br />Dune is about Paul's adventure throught the wide dessert of Arrakis, fighting against giant sand worms, traitorous royalty, the Emperor's soldiers (Sadaukaur) and the religious extremists who would follow Paul to the end of the universe, the Fremen. <br /> <br />The Fremen, who value water like gold and think of Jessica's powers as both amazing and deadly, and revere Paul like a god, teach these powerful humans the meaning of value, and the meaning of the phrase \\"you need to be the dessert to own it\\". <br /> <br />Frank Herbert's novel is atriumph among Sci-Fi, it's story, though simple enough to follow, grips you and pulls you along for a ride of suprising twists, turns, references to religion, values and a change in a Duke's son, that will leave the minds of all readers blank and speechless. <br /> <br />Read Dune and I promise that you will not be dissapointed! <br />
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I am a professional DJ of R&B, Hip Hop, Oldies (like the Temptations and Frank Sinatra), Jazz, and Top 40/Pop.  Working in this industry, you have to have a fervent ear for new sounds that come to mainstream. Corrine Bailey Rae can easily be accepted in the few that bring a genuine new sound.<br /><br />Her first self-titled release can be accepted into America's eclectic music history, in my opinion. Many people will compare her to Billie Holiday, Lauren Hill, Alicia Keys, Eryka Badu, India Arie, etc, etc. However, once you get her album, you will see that the comparisons are lucrative, but farfetched... Like a double negative. Sure, she has similarities to these trendsetting stars, but most of the claims are just from her lead single.<br /><br />Her album explains how her craft is different from what many presume. Ms. Rae the whole package: the look, the sound, the talent, and the consistency. With her look, she is not an eyesore, and in our society, being attractive will get you far. Nevertheless, in music, it will only get you so far. However, Ms. Rae has a very original voice. Not because of the obvious English accent, but because of its raspy tenor. Do not be fooled though; her album displays her tone verity, which will impress even the less experienced music critic. That also goes with the talent on the production. Corrine has credential tags on every track, clearly proving her ability once listening to the words. Lastly, her consistency. Though she has released this one album, she has continuously released new singles. That shows her urge to make music, which means there is more to come.
B000GTLQXU|4.0|I'm a diehard fan of the original THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE so I expected the remake would make for a distinct case of either Love or Loathe.  However, I feel quite contentedly into a seperate category.<br /><br />As a big budget action movie with top notch special effects, this POSEIDON is a fast paced and exciting spectacle.  As a STORY, however, it's sorely lacking and you're better off enjoying the campy, cardboard cliches of the 1972 Irwin Allen version.  His widow, Sheila Allen, served as an Executive Producer in this updated take but it must have been in name only, for the touches of her late husband (\\"the Master of Disaster\\") are not in evidence anywhere.  Not even the slightest wink in an homage to the Granddaddy of 'em all (and its legions of true-blue fans) can be found.<br /><br />Disaster/Action and Nautical fans, however, still will get a lot of satisfaction from this movie.  The special features, aside from some fun moments of with the special effects, are pretty negligible and a commentary track from the director, a star or even Ms.Allen would have been a welcome addition.
B00006SFBD|5.0|If there are, I have yet to find one.  I have Ghost Reveries, Still Life, Blackwater Park, and My Arms, Your Hearse in addition to Deliverance. Every single Opeth album I have is excellent and well worth it. Opeth is downright mesmerizing, and Mikael Akerfeldt has the best death metal growl in the business. The highly skilled band members can be brutal, but they also take you on a journey. If you are into this style of music, Opeth is VERY fulfilling.
7884064790|1.0|I haven't actually purchased this item nor have I watched it, but I did see this box set for sale on the Chinese black market. I have bought DVDs on the black market before and they are all of very low quality. Looking at the two other reviews, it does sound like the hallmark of the Chinese black market- poor English translation, ripped from the real thing, very low price. This set seems very cheap, but that's probably because it is bootlegged. Don't be fooled.

B000G759LW|5.0|Christina Aguilera latest release is her third studio album entitled Back to Basics. It's a double disc collection of music that reflects on the old school recordings of Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Etta James, and many other extraordinary vocalists of days gone by. The only difference is that Christina didn't record their material, she recorded all original songs, even co-penning all 22 tracks, executive producing and, of course, headlining each song as if her life depended on it. This is not just an album release of nearly two dozen tracks thrown together - this is a concept album, or as I like to call it, an event album. It has all the ingredients of the 1920's -1940's sound \\"with a modern twist,\\" as Aguilera points out, \\"to keep it sounding fresh.\\"<br /><br />The first single \\"Ain't No Other Man,\\" produced by DJ Premier, has already rocketed up into the Top 10, and it's unlike anything this former dirrty girl has ever released. The one thing that has remained constant is her impeccable vocal range. If I dare say it, Ms. Aguilera sounds better than I've ever heard her, and this material shows off her versatility like nothing she's ever done before. And it ain't just studio trickery. This girl is the real deal. Her live broadcast performance of her latest hit single on David Letterman's Late Show, the day after the CD's release, was so astounding that it even took ol' Dave back. He commented to Christina, \\"We have people on here virtually every night performing, but this was really a standout performance,\\" to which the audience most enthusiastically showed their appreciation. It takes a lot to win Dave over, but even I sat there with my mouth agape. This girl was on fire! The comparisons to her former rival Britney Spears are long behind her and this album should add a few more trophies to her three Grammy's, along with her countless other accolades.<br /><br />Disc 1 was put into the more than capable hands of DJ Premier and is comprised mostly of upbeat material that contains a lot of synthesized drum beats while never straying from the old school sound. It's one of the best and most interesting blends to be set down on wax. Kicking off this \\"concept\\" album is the first track \\"Intro (Back To Basics),\\" with opening lyrics by various male voices that sound as if they came straight off the radio from 1935 - \\"A very pleasant good evening ladies and gentlemen/ It is now time for the one and only/ There will never be another/ Christina Aguilera.\\" It's an introduction that's very reminiscent of the way The Beatles' greatest concept album \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" had begun.  Christina's vocal enters and lays out the very concept of this double disc set by paying tribute to all the greats that came before her. She sings \\"That's how music should sound/ I've waited for some time to get inside the minds of every legend I've ever wanted to stand beside.\\"  It's a beautiful and brave way to begin the journey. Any lesser singer would've had people scoffing `Who is she kidding?!' While it's actually appropriate at this time in Aguilera's career, at 25 she feels confident enough to include herself in such brilliant company as some of the pop and jazz greats she listened to growing up in Pennsylvania. Christina has said \\"this is the type of material I gravitated towards\\" when I was growing up.\\" She is also in great company, present day, on this extravaganza. She was joined by the legendary Steve Winwood on Track 2, \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray,\\" with Steve's signature sound all over the track channeling and sampling his great song \\"Glad\\" that he performed with his band Traffic, back in the day. All of the tracks on Disc 1 are exceptional, but the real standouts include \\"Oh Mother,\\" a tribute to her own mother and the abuse she had taken for years from her husband (Christina's dad), ultimately fleeing with her two daughters, Christina and her younger sister Rachel. \\"Back in the Day\\" is a sensational musical tribute to Christina's musical heroes that inspired this album. Closing out Disc 1 is a shout out to all of Christina's fans, while the track plays authentic taped messages that were left by them, all the while sampling the song that became her first #1, \\"Genie In A Bottle.\\" Christina and Premier's ingenious pairing on this disc would've been enough for a five-star rating, but just when you're ready to play it all over again, there's another disc to be heard.<br /><br />Disc 2 has Christina pairing up with her \\"Beautiful\\" co-songwriter/producer Linda Perry, and if I tell you that this is the best work I've ever heard from a contemporary vocalist of today, you better believe me! Most artists would've left well enough alone, and Disc 1 by itself would have been a smash while she could've held off a year and released Disc 2 on its own. But somehow, someway, this album wouldn't have been the \\"event\\" that it is without these additional 9 tracks. If you're a fan of the song \\"Beautiful,\\" which speaks bold and proud for anybody and everything that's outside \\"the norm,\\" then you're gonna love this ballad-heavy disc.<br /><br />Maybe I'm biased, but as brilliant as Disc 1 is, I'm a sucker for power ballads and great vocalizing. This is apparent throughout Disc 2, with the exception of track 3, \\"Candyman,\\" which is a throwback to The Andrew Sisters' best, and a constant reminder that Bette Midler did this type of material over thirty years ago on her first two albums. But somehow Christina still manages to make it her own with the spectacular multi-layered tracks and killer vocals. It's also the soon-to-be-released-to-radio second single. There's a lot of chutzpah in this portion of the album, most especially on track 8, \\"Hurt,\\" which is some of the best singing I have ever heard...ever. It's a surefire hit and should most definitely be on the schedule for a radio release. I wouldn't be surprised to hear this track as the third single when radio begs for more. It has #1 written all over it.<br /><br />Christina's husband of nearly 10 months was the inspiration for the wonderfully executed and beautifully written valentine \\"Save Me From Myself,\\" with such heartfelt lyrics as \\"My love is tainted by your touch/ Well some guys have shown me aces/ But you've got that royal flush/ I know it's crazy everyday/ Well tomorrow may be shaky/ But you never turn away.\\" And the album closes with the painful yet optimistic reality of her abusive father, and her new found love with her husband, Jordan. Christina's voice sings out \\"Thoughts racing fast through my mind/ As I'm going down the aisle/ That my future will mend my memories/ Torn between father and child/ My emotions overload/ Cause there is no hand to hold/ There's no shoulder here to lean on/ I'm walking all on my own/ Here I go...\\"<br /><br />It's interesting, because for \\"Back to Basics\\" Christina has taken firm hold of the reins cast right from the mold of Madonna. From conceptualizing to writing and executive producing, this is THE album that's sure to hand the crown over to Aguilera. One major factor that Christina has over Lady Madonna is THAT voice. While Madonna is brilliant at marketing herself as the ultimate showgirl and entrepreneur, Christina is proving to have all of that and just a bit more.<br /><br />Christina Aguilera made a name for herself at the top of the charts seven short years ago with \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" and \\"What A Girl Wants.\\" A couple of years later she got beautifully \\"Dirrty\\" and showed the world her edgier side, which gained her an even larger fanbase. Now she's come \\"Back to Basics\\" with her third official studio release and to say she's conquered the pop music world this time around wouldn't even do her justice.

B000002UB3|5.0|\\"Abbey Road\\" was technically the last studio album recorded by the Beatles.    As many know, it would not be the last studio album released by the Fab Four.  The Beatles actually recorded the \\"Let It Be\\" album before \\"Abbey Road\\", but it was put on hold because the Fab Four was unhappy with the album.    It was clear toward the end of the 1960s that the Beatles were having problems operating as a group.   At times when emotions run a high, an act will usually rise to the occasion.   \Nearly a decade after \\"Abbey Road\\", Fleetwood Mac would record \\"Rumours\\".  The story of Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\" is well documented. Despite many inner conflicts, Fleetwood Mac rose to the occasion to produce one of the great albums of all time.   Much of the success of bringing that effort together must be given to \\"Rumours\\" producers Ken Callait and Richard Dashut.   While \\"Rumours\\" was an amazing effort, \\"Abbey Road\\" was perhaps even a greater challenge for producer George Martin.   Martin not only had to contend with in-fighting and clashing egos, but he also had to contend with assembling unfinished works.    Martin's effort has to be considered one of the greatest production efforts in music history.   But the Beatles didn't leave Martin with any scraps - they provided a solid foundation of music for Martin to deliver a final end product. <br /> <br />\\"Abbey Road\\" would have 8 tracks followed by what was termed \\"The Long Medley\\".- consisting of several songs - some were finished and some were clearly unfinished.    This is where Martin (and to some extent Paul McCartney) was able to work his magic and assemble the medley into a body of work - helping maintain the Beatles record as innovators.  The 8 tracks preceding the medley are also classics - proving the Beatles hadn't lost any creative edge. <br /> <br />Here is a track by track review: <br /> <br />\\"Come Together\\":  A legendary Beatles track.    McCartney's bass is awesome on this song - and is lock step in sync with some very good percussion by Ringo Starr. <br /> <br />\\"Something\\": This song proved to me that George Harrison didn't need to use the Sitar to create a legendary song.    The bridge where Harrison sings \\"You're asking me will my love grow...\\" is as good as a bridge gets. <br /> <br />\\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\":  This song didn't excite me at first, but it soon grew on me.   Lennon/McCartney tunes tend to have \\"characters\\".  This one (while more of a McCartney effort) has \\"Maxwell Edison\\" a medical student.   Despite the song's \\"darker\\" theme, it is a catchy tune.   <br /> <br />\\"Oh Darling\\": Another song that also grows on you.    These one has somewhat of a Bluesy feel to it. <br /> <br />\\"Octopus' Garden\\": This Ringo's song from a songwriting and vocals perspective.   Ringo never gets his respect in this area and I feel he deserves it - this song exemplifies his talents and showcases his sense of humor. <br /> <br />\\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\":  This is a nice cross being hard rock and psychedelica.   The song has a mantra-feel to it.   The sudden end to the song is a contrast to the Long Medley that follows. <br /> <br />\\"Here Comes the Sun\\": This is another legendary song by Harrison.   While not a song that has the strong Indian influence of his other works, I can still hear some Indian influences in the melody. <br /> <br />\\"Because\\":  This song has a heavy psychedelic influence.  The harmonies between McCartney, Harrison, and John Lennon are amazing. <br /> <br />\\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\":  This song kicks off the long medley.   This is a terrific song and its classic McCartney - complete with some great piano.  I love the way McCartney changes tempo with the vocals  In a way, this song forms the foundation of the Long Medley as there is a reprise of this song in \\"Carry Your Weight\\". <br /> <br />\\"Sun King\\":  This is the 2nd song of the medley.   The \\"Romance\\" language mix of Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian are the highlight here. <br /> <br />\\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\":  Third song of the medley - another catchy track.   This seems to be one of the unfinished tracks.   This time Lennon and McCartney introduce us to the character \\"Mr. Mustard\\".   This is one of the songs that it would have been great to see how it would have wound up in its final form. <br /> <br />\\"Polythene Pam\\": Fourth song of the medley and also an unfinished song.  It bridges terrifically from \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" and into \\"She Came In Through the Bathroom Window\\".  I love the guitar work in this song.   Here is another case where I could only imagine how good a full version of this song would have been. <br /> <br />\\"She Came In Through the Bathroom Window\\": Fifth song of the medley.   This song never excited me, but it still fits good in the medley. <br /> <br />\\"Golden Slumbers\\": There is more of a \\"break\\" as the medley progresses to this song.  I categorize this song as a lullaby \\"Beatles Style\\".  It would have been great to see this song in its final form. <br /> <br />\\"Carry That Weight\\":  This song features all Beatles in harmony - and this proves to be the song's strength.   It is the perfect segue from the lullaby-ish \\"Golden Slumbers\\".  The reprise of \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" fits in beautifully.    <br /> <br />\\"The End\\":   This is the eighth and final track of the medley.   It is the perfect ending.   It features a terrific drum solo by Ringo, but also has some outstanding guitar solos each by Paul, George, and John.   The title and solos are almost prophetic as this was the last track recorded by the Fab Four as a unit. <br /> <br />\\"Her Majesty\\": This is a short, folksy track that was added.  Many consider this the first \\"hidden\\" track as it was something that was not originally intended by the Beatles sfor the collection. <br /> <br />Overall, this is one terrific collection.   I wouldn't stop short to say that this might be the best Beatles studio album made.   This is one I highly recommend.
B0000AZKPC|5.0|This band brings depth, quality, and skill to the table for our enjoyment.  They can go fast, like Dragonforce, but they also know how to make a ballad.  I prefer their harder stuff though, but don't have to skip tracks because it is all very good.  Sometimes you can hear Tony Kakko's Finnish accent, but it does not detract from the music in my opinion.  I have Reckoning Night and Winterheart's Guild (in addition to Ecliptica) and they are also worth getting.  If you like Sonata Arctica's style, make sure you pick up all 3 titles that I mentioned.  They are very satisfying.
B000AMPZF8|3.0|Having highly enjoyed \\"Absolution\\", I figured \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" would be equally good. Though you can hear some of the musical seeds that resulted in \\"Absolution\\" in this album, they simply were not ripe yet and sound nowhere as good as the band's landmark production, released three years later. I would say pass on this album and, if you haven't, get yourself a copy of \\"Absolution\\" instead.
B0007OASII|5.0|And what an intro it was!  I was amazed at the medieval meets Metal sound.  It was just what I was looking for.  I read more about them and listened to samples and discovered that The Black Halo is not the only GREAT Kamelot album.  I ended up getting Epica too, and, well, it was EPIC.  Kamelot knows how to tell you a story with their lyrics while providing a rich full sound to accompany them.  From what I have read and heard, I believe that the 2 albums I mentioned are Kamelot's best work.  Don't hesitate to buy either or both of them.
B000HC2LIK|5.0|I'm like the other reviewers who couldn't wait until next year for the boxed set. The transfer shows the age of the film in some shots, notably in the beginning, but through most of the film it looks great. At times, it looks fantastic. There can be no doubt that it's a huge improvement over what we've had before. The sound seems clearer too although I hope there is a 5.1 mix added to the ultimate release next year. <br /> <br />For anyone who doesn't know, Ridley Scott is preparing a \\"Final Cut\\" of the film that's going to be shown in theaters next year prior to the release of the big Blade Runner boxed set. That release is likely to appear on HD-DVD/Blu Ray as well. <br /> <br />I'm in the minority, but I prefer the theatrical release of the film to the version presented here. For the theatrical release, the studio insisted on a narration by Harrison Ford to explain the film to audiences. I find that this director's cut has a lot of unnatural silences where the narration used to be and for me, that throws the pacing of the film off. I've heard that Ridley's final cut will include some of the narration. That could very well be the best version of this film yet. <br /> <br />We'll know in 2007. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, seeing this great film finally look great is worth the  $12.99, even for a \\"double-dip\\" release.

B000E1JOSE|5.0|This is all you need to have of Roy Orbison, a fantastic televised concert that featured Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, among many others.  It is very nice to see the CD and DVD released once again.  Orbison's voice carried the evening on such immortal songs as Dream Baby, Ooby Dooby and Pretty Woman.  At the same time he was doing fantastic work with The Traveling Wilburies.  It was a veritable Roy Orbison revival in the late 80's.  Unfortunately, he passed away all too quickly and didn't have the opportunity to enjoy the fruits of his labor.  His voice is one of the quentessential voices of rock and roll, and this is a stunning tribute to the man behind the dark sunglasses.
B00000IN5G|5.0|If you like your music fast, heavy, complex, and intense, look no further than Children of Bodom's 3 best offerings: Follow the Reaper, Hatebreeder, and Hate Crew Deathroll. I have all 3 albums and I am very happy with each of them. The only complaint I have is that the albums are a little short in duration. Other than that, no problems whatsoever. If you are a hardcore metalhead or someone just starting out, make sure you pick up one or all of the titles I mentioned. They rock!
B000059Z8J|4.0|This is the excellent movie that effectively began the superhero movie genre. <br /> <br />The DVD version of the movie has two additional scenes not in the theatrical version. <br /> <br />One is an additional scene of Superman listening to a recording of his dead father, Jor-El, in the Fortress of Solitude before \\"becoming\\" Superman.  This apparently takes several years, as he is a late-teen Clark Kent when he enters the Fortress, and Christopher Reeve when he leaves. <br /> <br />The other is the famous \\"Gauntlet of Death\\" Superman must pass through before the first time he enters Lex Luthor's subterranian home. <br /> <br />In my opinion, both scenes are weak, unnecessary, and hurt the pacing, particularly the latter. <br /> <br />The DVD also has two deleted scenes. <br /> <br />The first develops the relationship between Lex Luthor and Miss Teschmacher.  I think this is an excellent scene that should have been included in the movie. <br /> <br />The other shows a vengeful Luthor preparing to kill Teschmacher for betraying him.  Superman shows up and saves her at the last moment.  This scene was unnecessary and would have harmed continuity with the sequel, so I agree with the decision to leave it out. <br /> <br />The DVD also contains some screen tests for the parts of Superman, Lois Lane, and Ursa.  Margot Kidder was chosen over Stockard Channing for the part of Lois Lane.  Go figure.  The director explains that Channing projected too much strength and intelligence.  This would have been more in keeping with the character of Lois Lane as she is traditionally depicted in other sources, and Superman's attraction to her would have been much more understandable.  Donner chose to go in a different direction.  I think this was a huge mistake. <br /> <br />There are also other extras, listed in Amazon's description above, but these are not as memorable as the deleted scenes and screen tests. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  Excellent movie (though weakened by the added scenes) and interesting extras.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|For a band that has been around almost 30 years, usually the best you can expect from a new album is a single decent song or two, and a lot of filler, with the album release used as an excuse to do yet another nostalgia tour. <br /> <br />What amazes me about A Matter of Life and Death is not just the quality of the album, but the ambition as well.  A 10 song album that's 72 minutes long, a semi-concept album at that?  After their long dead period in the 90s, its amazing to think that Maiden has come back and produced such an impressive work. <br /> <br />While not going through a track-by-track review, I'm especially pleased with the quality of the production work.  The sound is crisp and clear, but also features a certain live punch, which I know they were going for in the studio.  The best I could describe it is a more modern 'Seventh Son' but with a harder, more spirited edge to the sound.  I'm also impressed with the quality of the individual players.  The drums and bass are crisp and energetic, while the guitar solos are some of the best I've heard on a Maiden album.  The keyboards are there just enough to provide an impressively grand sound to some of the tracks without being distracting.  Meanwhile, Bruce hasn't shown this much range, both in vocal ability and emotion, in years. <br /> <br />I pride myself on constantly updating my metal collection, and have puchased dozens of CDs this year from contemporary metal bands, so I do not see myself as someone lost in the 80s.  I stack this purchase right up there with the other contemporary acts in their prime like Mastodon, In Flames, Amon Amarth, Kalmah, and Shadows Fall.
0064431789|5.0|I have loved this story of Max who goes to where the wild things are.  He becomes the most wild of them all.  Great artwork easy beginners book.  No library is complete without it.
0783225849|5.0|Though made in 1960, it still captivates and charms you like it was made yesterday. Well, maybe that phrase is inaccurate because if it were made yesterday, it would more than likely suck: as does most of the horror movies made.    Psycho uses suspense and progression of storyline to provide its scares, not a bunch of gore and shock value thrown together. Keep in mind, there's nothing wrong with blood and gore in a horror movie, but many think that's all a horror movie needs: just incessant killing with no compassion or respect for any of its characters and story. Can it offer anything else other than murder that makes it endearing? Well, Psycho does.    I swear, everytime I watch it, it's like watching it for the first time even though I know how it will turn out. I envy those who don't know the twist and are watching it for the first time.    Simply put, the movie is as near perfect as a film could be. Some criticize the psychiatrist's part as being unnecessary, and doing nothing other than dumbing down the movie. I partly disagree. If not for that exposition at the end, many people today would still be debating what happened, just like they do with Basic Instinct and Mulholland Drive. There is a difference between dumbing down your movie and simply providing clarity. I just think the style of the scene should have been different. Maybe a shrink speaking with just Sam and Lila as opposed to a room full of people with their mouths agape as the psychiatrist walks around explaining everything despite only having examined the case for a few hours.    Anthony Perkins is perfect as Norman, and even the mediocre acting of Vera Miles and the \\"stiff\\" who plays Sam Loomis doesn't detract from the movie's near perfection.    After watching the remake of Pyscho by Gus Van Sant, it becomes evident that a lot of factors go into making a movie great. It's not just the story. It's not just the actors. It's not just the director. It's a combination of all of that, plus style and alittle luck.    Bottom Line: A great film that hasn't aged. It's Hitchcock's best. And yes, I've seen Rear Window and Vertigo.
B00005JP5J|5.0|\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is as good as comedy gets. If you can see only one funny movie this summer-- I'm not sure what else is out there-- run to see this one while it's still in the cool theatres. Abigail Breslin, a runner-up in a local children's  beauty pageant, is thrust into the limelight when the winner renounces her title and this child must go across the country to enter the national \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" beauty pageant finals. She is joined by her hyper-dysfunctional family: her father (Greg Kinnear), who is trying to sell his motivational message to the masses;  her mom ( Toni Collette); her gay uncle (Steve Carell), a Proust scholar who has just tried suicide-- he's even a failure at that-- her teenaged brother who has taken a vow of silence and only communicates by note pad; and finally her grandfather, who likes both sex and heroin (Alan Arkin). This over-the-top family travels in a VW van, in a laugh-a-minute trip that turns William Faulkner's novel AS I LAY DYING on its head.<br /><br />This movie spoofs a lot of things about America, not the least of which are those beauty pageants for toddlers and children. (My own hometown did have something called \\"Little Miss Petite Beauty Pageant\\".) Without giving away the plot, I'll just say what this child chooses for her entry in the talent competition (it has been a well-kept secret between her and her grandfather) will make you laugh out loud.<br /><br />This movie is not to be missed.
B000FSME1A|5.0|THIS 2 DISC EDITION IS FULL OF EXTRAS. MANY DELETED SCENES AND MAKING OF FEATURES. ALSO A FULL LENGTH COMMENTARY FROM COPPOLA HIMSELF. YES, THIS MOVIE IS ON 2 DISC'S, BUT IT IS FOR A MUCH BETTER PICTURE QUALITY. HOWEVER, <br />THE HEART OF DARKNESS IS NOT INCLUDED HERE, BUT IS A FILM ALL BY ITSELF. I THINK MANY REVIEWERS ARE BEING UNFAIR ABOUT THIS GREAT RELEASE.
032147404X|5.0|I have enjoyed photography as a hobby for 50+years.  I own a Canon 20D and am a Scott Kelby fan.  He is a great photoshop expert, yet emphasizes the importance of getting the best possible shot when taking the picture, to make your time in photoshop more enjoyable.  You don't have to work as hard if you make the correct exposure to begin with.   <br />Scott approaches each chapter with some humor, and really understands what you really need is a clear bottom line on how to approach the person or subject you want to photograph.   <br />I received my book Sept 4th, read it and used some of his tips shooting 500+ volleyball pictures Sept 5th. I think I can see some improvement in my pictures already. <br />He has equipment recommendations and shooting tips for the person that has just bought a digital camera to the person that uses it to make a living. <br />He has worked alongside of professionals learning tips on how to process the digital photographs and how to best print them.  Scott believes photography can be more fun if you get results you like by using some of the basic principles used by professional photographers.    <br />I have unhesitatingly recommended this book to several of my friends.  <br />This is one of the least expensive camera related purchases that I have made to bring my excitement of photography to a new level.    <br />I am quite certain you won't be disappointed, especially if you own a Nikon or Canon digital SLR.   <br />I expect my copy to become dog eared from use.    <br />
0688170528|4.0|Similar to Kevin Cropp's \\"The Time Keeper\\", Jodi Piccoult does an excellent job of touching on issues relevant to teenagers today. I am a big fan of her writting, however, I found myself a little frustrated while reading \\"The Pact\\". While the writing is incredible, and the issues are real I had a hard time buying into the fact that Chris did not share his story with anyone until his trial. It is a great story of love and trust, but sometimes I found myself wanting to scream \\"what in the world are you thinking\\"??? All in all, I am still a big fan of Piccoult and her writing. I applaude her for touching on hard topics facing teens today, and I look forward to continuing to read such a talented writer.
B00009RXLG|1.0|This DVD was a great disappointment.  For being a nostalgic look back at some names like The Missing Link,Kevin Sullivan, Kamala, Kerry von Erich, the matches themselves are for the most part very inconsequential.  The talents of these icons of oddity are barely shown, for the matches often end very quickly or through outside interference, continuing a storyline that the DVD doesn't present at all.  All of the sound comes from the original commentary from the matches, so it feels like you've come across someone's VHS tape that has been used continually to tape shows and you end up with a smattering of matches that make very little sense because there's no sense of context.<br /><br />I'm rather sorry I even watched this one.
B000067FP7|4.0|This DVD has great features, all including: <br /> <br />*Over 10 MINUTES of never before seen footage <br />*Behind the Scenes Documentary <br />*Commentary By: Joe Dante, Phoebe Cates, Zach Galligan, Dick Miller, and Howie Mandel <br />*Commentary By: Joe Dante, Michael Finnell,  Chris Wales <br />*Storyboard Gallery <br />*Theatrical Trailer
B000002OX3|1.0|This album is terrible. It really stinks. I'm not sure about the Who. They are certainly overrated. I don't think they are in the top ten bands of all time. \\"Who's Next\\" is a good album but this mess is another in a long line of dreadful albums put out by the pretentious Pete Townshend. I really tried to get into this CD and listened to it 3 or 4 times hoping it would grow on me. It didn't. Last I saw, my dog had gotten ahold of it and tore it to shreds. \\"Good boy!! Watch out for glass shards...Don't cut your mouth chewing that CD case to bits\\"...
B00006YXE4|5.0|This is my favorite live cd & dvd by far.  Bought it for myself & a friend and had to buy another copy for myself...just in case something should happen to the original--IT'S THAT GOOD.  This version of BADGE is by far the best I've heard ever.  It's hard listening to the original after hearing this--it is such a jam!!  I was lucky to see this tour and \\"re-seeing\\" the dvd gave me chills!  How he opens LAYLA is classic.  Billy Preston singing WILL IT GO ROUND IN CIRCLES is a teriffic jam too.  Again, you'll never want to hear the original ever again.  Definately buy, you won't regret it.
0679783261|5.0|The first time I read this book was at the age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100 pages, I had finally \\"learnt the language,\\" and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of 35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read, but not in the mood to read something new.<br /><br />Every time I read it, I am struck by its relevance. I don't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society (although I think we still see a little of that to this day). I refer to the characters. Their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless. I can identify with every single character in this novel. When Lizzy and Mr. Darcy fell in love, their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. That is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films.<br /><br />You cannot possibly do wrong by reading this novel.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album is amazing and is an excellent double album by an already legendary group.  I would never have thought that the Chili Peppers could have outdone their previous works, but in my eyes they have.  It is almost like they have taken all of their great albums \\"BSSM\\", \\"Californication\\", and \\"By the Way\\", and put them into one album. You could put most of these songs onto those albums somewhere or another and they would fit perfectly.  Not only that, they have outdone themselves and made so many great songs that I think would belong as singles.    The opener and first single \\"Dani California\\" does not do this album justice, even though the song has gotten a lot of praise and a LOT of airplay.   Songs that I believe can be and should be singles include:  \\"Snow (hey oh)\\"  \\"Charlie\\"  \\"Stadium Arcadium\\"  \\"Especially in Michigan\\"  \\"Wet Sand\\"  \\"Desecration Smile\\"  \\"Tell me Baby\\"  \\"Hard to Concentrate\\"  \\"21st Century\\"  \\"Readymade\\"  \\"Storm in a Teacup\\"  and \\"Turn it Again\\"    Ok I know twelve songs is a lot but they all are worthy.  But even the rest of the album is awsome.  This is definetely the rock album of the year.  Anthony Kiedis sings his heart out about love more than ever, but still has the funky feel of the peppers in a few of the songs... such as \\"Hump de Bump\\", \\"Warlocks\\", :C'mon Girl\\", and \\"21st Century\\"..  Just about every song has a John Frusciante guitar solo, and they bring power to this album.  Turn it again has a great ending, which the only fault I have is that they should have made the song longer than the 6 minutes it already is.  Im sure all the true RHCP fans already have this album. But even if you have not really been a big fan of them in the past, I promise you would Enjoy this album.  Now if they can ever top this, that would be one shot shy of extraordinary.
1416524800|4.0|Just finished reading this book, finally! As usual, i will give a good/bad breakdown of this novel.<br /><br />Good: First off, Brown gets the gold star for research. Although im not much of an expert on glaciology or the inner workings of NASA, I will say this boy did his homework. All the info was well researched, well written, and I was surprised all the way until the end. I also liked how the two story lines intertwined.<br /><br />Bad: Was a bit long and seemed to drag out in some points. Some of the info was technical jargon. It did help the reader understand, but it also made it a little boring.<br /><br />In all, it was an interesting story, but not as good as Digital Fortress. But it was very well written. Great job.
B00003CWPL|1.0|There are cinematic masterpieces, and there are films that really make you feel the producer knows how to use film to its fullest.  This stinker convinced me Mr. Lynch owned shares in Kodak and wanted to sell film by the mile.  The only reason you may want to see this is so you will convince yourself never to see a David Lynch work ever again.  Do not buy it!!  Manos, The Hands of Fate is much more watchable than this. <br />I get Brian Eno and ambient/atmosphere music is so you will use it as a background along with your imagination to create your own inner experience.  Film doesn't work that way (another reviewer compared this with Eno).   <br />I find Memento a brilliant piece of work, really making me forget I am watching a film.  I think Videodrome is wonderful and compelling.  This - make sure you can watch something else.  Watch this in 100x speed.  You won't miss a thing. <br />Okay, I just remembered, there is one movie worse than this one.  Reflections Of Evil.  If you actually like Eraserhead then get that movie too.  Me, I'd rather put a brain-eating worm in my ear from whatever planet Kahn was exiled to in Star Trek II.  Much less painful than watching this.
B000H7JD4K|2.0|Why does this album get 5 stars from many reviewrs?...cos maiden could fart on an album and these stefords would claim it's the best album of all time.  These songs are just like brave new world and dance of death, long and boring tunes with no feel or soul. Why does every song have to be over 7 minute with boring intros?....Stick with eightes maiden!
031236198X|5.0|John Kotter's \\"Leading Change\\" and \\"The Heart of Change\\" laid out a prescription for the serious and difficult work of implementing change, in an increasingly more competitive and faster paced global marketplace. <br /> This latest work, \\"Our Iceberg is Melting\\" is, to my knowledge, a first. It is a fable, which brings ALIVE, in a very AMUSING and ENTERTAINING QUICK forty-five minute read, the widely accepted logic and concepts of an author's previous writings. It makes understanding, and discussing, difficult change FUN! <br /> Any manager/executive looking for a way to add some energy and fun to his change initiatives should make this required reading for his team/employees. Then have a non-threatening discussion, with his team/employees, comparing their situation and team to that of the group of penguins in this book. The behavioral similarities will amaze you. The insights gained will be invaluable. <br />
B00004TH7Z|2.0|another boring maiden CD, but the stefords will claim it to be one of their very best. Brave new world, dance of death, and A matter of life and death are like one long boring album.
B00005MP58|5.0|The Colin Firth/Jenifer Ehle version is incomprable. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most amazing novels of the english language. This version done by the BBC (homeland of Jane Austen!!!) is the best out of the several hollywoodized attempts to capture Austen's magic. Though the Laurence Olivier version is tolerable, this BBC version follows the book the closest and is truest costume and style. I believe if Jane Austen were around today she would want her Mr. Darcy to be played by Colin Firth.  (On that note, let me say that Colin Firth is positively goregous and never looks better then he does in this film, and he is quite attractive in the Bridget Jones Diary movies, also a Mr. Darcy.) This is one of the most romantic and fantastic novels and flims ever. I would highly reccomend this to anyone who is intrested in Austen, classic literature, or is sucker for romance and wit (and Colin Firth)!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This album has come to be one of my favorites(listening to it as I type this).  Already being a huge Dire Straits fan, I came across Mark one night during health class thanks to one of my fellow classmates.  I love Marks voice, its a mix of masculinity and softness.  Pair that with Emmylous feminine vocals and the combination is a winner.  This album is great because you can get the sense that the songs written really mean something to both Mark and Emmylou.  I am really glad that my fellow classmate told me about Mark because it gave us something to talk about and I have come to really enjoy his music.
B000001EGA|5.0|I've been a die hard elton fan for many years and this still is his best work in my opion the songs fit together like a puzzle <br />so perfectly.SOMEONE SAVED MY LIFE TONIGHT still a haunting masterpiece and the final WE ALL FALL IN LOVE SOMETIMES/ CURTAINS <br />The original bands best work as well as some of TAUPINS finnest <br />lyrics. i still can't figure out why he broke the original band <br />up after this classic piece of history.
B000002UJQ|5.0|One of the most brilliant and influential rock albums of all time, OK Computer takes listeners on a journey through all types of music.  From the opening chord of Airbag through the last note of the Tourist, Radiohead crafts a beautifully textured, incredibly moving, and just plain brilliant symphony. <br /> <br />When trying to describe Radiohead the main word that comes to mind is texture.  They are able to play one lick over and over again, but make it new by adding new sounds everytime.  Great examples of this are on Airbag and Exit Music (for a film).  This album also has some great sing alongs like Karma Police.  Most of the songs are easily accessible and stay with you long after you've listened. <br /> <br />In reality, this is the best album of the 90s.  It combines all of the greatest elements of rock and roll.
B000001EG6|5.0|Most of us here in the states never heard ELTON JOHN until YOUR SONG. This disc was a melodical feast .I NEED YOU TO TURN TO ,SIXTY YEARS ON,TAKE ME TO THE PILOT,BORDER SONG my two favorites  THE GREATEST DISCOVERY and THE KING MUST DIE.One listen you knew ELTON was gonna be around a long long time.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Awesome album.  I am enjoying it a lot.  However, I was listening to the song \\"Lord of Light\\", and heard a passage that sounded familiar.  After thinking about it for a while, and listening to it again, I realized it was very similar to a passage from the song \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\", from 1984's \\"Powerslave\\".  Specifically, it starts at 4:55 on \\"Lord of Light\\", and on 4:35 on \\"RotAM\\".  Does anyone agree?  Has anyone noticed the similarities?  Those two riffs end in almost the exact same combination of notes and tempo.  Anyway, glad to hear new great material from the Metal Masters.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|In my opinion, I loved it. It came with excellent compositions, and the graphics are amazingly beautiful. Almost looked real.<br /><br />Although it focuses more on action than plot, I still gave it a 10, or a 5, as you call it.<br /><br />I haven't played the game, but I was so intrigued, I went online, and now I know alot about it!<br /><br />This is the reason why I became such a FINAL FANTASY VII fanatic!
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|I love it that this is out in DVD so everyone can watch it over and over to see how these dancers work out and get in shape and see their joy in dancing.  I was amazed at Baryshnikov's flexibility, when he does the splits on the floor, against the wall, and the strength of the jumps of both dancers.  Hines' footwork was really beautiful, too.  Being a dance devotee, I am always very impressed with the way dancers work so hard, and you could see it here.  The movie had a fun plot that was serious, too.  You knew it would end up okay but it made you think.  The music was excellent and upbeat, too, as well as the scenes of Russia and the theater.  I'm happy to have this in my permanent collection, because it's really a classic for dance fans.
B000H7JD4K|3.0|Don't love it. Want to. Am trying really, really hard. I automatically buy anything of Iron Maiden or Bruce, no questions asked. But for me, ONE good epic track is all an album needs (maybe TWO at the most). And if I'm going to take the time to listen to an epic track (and I'm considering anything 7 minutes or more an epic), it better be an INCREDIBLE song, a la Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner. My point is, too many long  songs on this album. And they all kind of blend together in a nondescript way. And they don't really have killer choruses I want.  And they just aren't that memorable. Even the shorter songs are kind of blah. I mean, Different world is decent, but, that and the Reincarnation are my two favoriate songs on the album - but they'd be middle of the road on any other Maiden album. I pick those two as my favorite because I HAVE to. Overall, I'm disappointed. I certainly like Brave New World better than this. And feel like this probably ties Dance of Death. (Nothing on this is anywhere nearly as catchy as Rainmaker, or as rousing of a chorus as Death of Death.) Maybe it'll grow on me with a few more spins.
B00004I9VE|4.0|I bought this SACD format because I assumed (yeah yeah I know) that it would be 5.1 mix. It is not. I was really looking forward to a surround mix of this recording. I finally read the bottom of the back of the label where it it stated the 2 channel mix. When doing A/B switching between my regular CD and this SACD (both in 2 channel), I could hear subtle nuances that were clearer than the old CD... nothing ground breaking just a bit clearer. So I don't take it as a total loss. I just wish (1) that they would expand the surround recordings and (2) label conspicuosly whether it is a 5.1 or stereo mix.
0894803123|5.0|Well I was shocked when I received this book that the recipes inside are actual Ben & Jerry's flavors. I figured they would be when I bought, but I figured on being disappointed. Making these is not a complicated 40 step process like some recipes. If you love Ben & Jerry's great Ice Creams and like making your own, you will enjoy these recipes.
B000AARKOO|4.0|This movie is about a French blacksmith who goes to the Holy Land with his astranged father so that he and his wife who commited suicide could be forgiven for their sins. This movies takes place during the 2nd Crusade and ends at the begining of the third.       The movie itself is full of historical inaccuraces but I don't think that this movie was made to be accurate but instead to capture the escence of the Crusades. It shows Christians going to the Holy Land to be redeemed for their sinns, to fight for their religious beliefs and on a smaller scale how some only wanted land and power. It also it doesn't show the Muslims as villians but as people fighting for their beliefs as well.     The scenery, battles and costumes are very good and believable. Orlando Bloom is okay in this movie although dull at times but the rest of the cast is much better.    If you are looking for an accurate Crusader movie then look elsewhere but if you're looking for a movie that captures the escence of the Crusades then you should see this movie. Also I would recommend you get the one 4 disc one because it has a buch of deleted scenes that take away from the movie and it helps explain it better, or so I have heard.
0783225849|5.0|This is one great movie! Although Robert Bloch's novel was partially based on the horrors of Ed Gein, there are only a few basic similarities between the two. Whatever the novel's influence, the movie version is 100% vintage Hitchcock. This is fortunate for us because in the hands of anyone else, this likely would have turned into either a sleazy exploitation movie or a turgid melodrama. In Hitchcock's hands, however, this is a suspenseful, intense character study of a quiet loner. Norman is a meek and mild mannered man who wouldn't harm anyone; it is his mother one needs to beware. The construction of the movie is flawless, as are the cinematography and score. Although the combination of these alone would have likely made this movie great, it is the performance of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates that makes this film so outstanding. He is excellent in this role and one must compare to lesser performances in other films about psychotics in order to truly appreciate how good he is here. For better or worse, Perkins was indelibly linked with this character after \\"Psycho.\\" (I guess this is price to pay for being so good at something)  The culmination of all the efforts put into this film is a fantastic work of cinema.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Previous to Jethro Tull's \\"Aqualung\\" several singer/songwriters took pot shots at orgainized religion. But they were mostly cheap shots as well. Ian Anderson gave it both barrels--passion and intelligence. I don't think the Church of England expected this lambasting, nor do I think ever recovered from it. <br /> <br />Musically, this is one of the most recognized and accomplished albums of hard rock of the 70s. Make that 70s and 80s. Martin Barre, never really appreciated as much as he should have, is nothing less than sizzling here. The group is tight. The interspersing of short snippet tunes, mostly accoustic, appear to be fillers to some critics, but actually they provide a pacing for the album as a whole. A sort of lull before the storm. I know I am also nostalgic about \\"Aqualung\\" but these reviews are supposed to be subjective. Still, it's hard not to acknowledge, objectively, that this was the Mount Everest of 70s music.
B000679N96|3.0|I want to like this series of reissues a whole lot more than I do. The sound quality is great, and the lean, angular sounds of this album are given a new punch and sparkle through the remastering. <br /> <br />My first hesitation is that Rhino has released the album in its original UK version. Not many folks might agree with me, but I find the US version (which I grew up with) far superior, largely due to the replacement of the UK version's weakest tracks with superb singles like \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" and \\"Jumping Someone Else's Train.\\" These tracks are included on the bonus disc, but Rhino has--frustratingly--left off those singles' superb B-sides, \\"10:15 Saturday Night\\" and \\"Plastic Passion,\\" both of which appeared on the US version. Given that Rhino has included an entire second disc, there's really no reason not to include these tracks. A missed opportunity. <br /> <br />The Cure's B-sides and rarities have already been compiled on a box set, so the bonus discs in this series consist largely of demos and live recordings. With the exception of the singles mentioned above, the bonus disc here is interesting mainly as an historical curiosity. This is something most folks will listen to once and never again.  <br /> <br />My final hesitation comes with the $25 price tag--which seems awfully high to pay for a remastered album and a second disc consisting almost entirely of home demos. Other labels have released similarly expanded versions and managed to keep the price under $20. <br /> <br />Rhino is also releasing the Cure's catalog in remastered, single disc format, so folks who are deterred by the high price should just wait around a bit.
B000GFLE1S|4.0|Kinky Boots is supposedly based on a true story, but that doesn't stop it from coming across as absolutely preposterous. Admittedly the film is entertaining, but its also totally predictable and precious, and even a little bit old fashioned. And while it doesn't have the star wattage of Calendar Girls or the originality of The Full Monty, Kinky Boots tries to make up for it by bringing gender-bending Soho to the staid and working class Northampton.  <br /> <br />In Kinky Boots Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Lola, a flamboyant London transvestite who sings in a cheesy Soho nightclub. She's a big girl, constantly rattling on about sexiness and how her thigh-high red stiletto boots are \\"tubular sex.\\" Life for Lola irrevocably changes when she meets the feckless Charlie (Joel Edgerton) who owns an established footwear company in the north of England. <br /> <br />When his father dies, Charlie is dismayed to discover that the business is far from booming. He spends an afternoon firing people until Lauren (Sarah-Jane Potts) a young woman at the factory challenges him to find a better solution. On a trip to London, Charlie encounters the fabulous Lola and through her and her mates he finds a niche market creating sexy boots big enough and tough enough to be worn by cross-dressing adult men.  <br /> <br />Employing Lola as his design consultant - where against her better judgment she travels to Northampton - the factory has a couple of false starts, but soon it works like a charm and Charlie and his cohorts are off to Milan to model and hopefully sell their new \\"kinky boots.\\"   <br /> <br />Of course, it's not all-smooth sailing and there's various subplots involving Charlie's narrow-minded and grasping fiancé, Lola's encounters with the bigoted men at the factory, Lola having to come to terms with her past, and the difficulties of designing a boot that will fit, but the centre of the tale is all about tolerance and working together and all those good things. It's all fairly predictable, but it's pleasant.  <br /> <br />Directed by Julian Jarrold, the film has a polished and genteel feel to it and he certainly keeps the action moving along nicely - the pacing never lags. The film is reportedly based on a true story. But that doesn't guarantee truthfulness. The facts, whatever they may be, have most likely been beaten into a formulaic, feel-good movie. Right down to its dizzy finale at a Milan fashion show taken over by drag queens, the movie is totally mechanical from the get go.  <br /> <br />The other main problem is that the talented Ejiofor - who does much of his own singing - isn't that good of a singer, and his drag act come across as a bit cheap and perfunctory. It also doesn't help that he looks rather ugly in a dress. His performance is indeed flamboyant, but only partly convincing because he lacks the vital component - genuine sexual provocation. This drag queen may save the day, but in the end he comes across as a bit of an asexual saint, and that for me is a bit of a cop out. Mike Leonard September 06.  <br />
B000GI3KHQ|3.0|It is indeed outrageous that Billy Budd--certainly one of the top 10 films of all time, offering the best career performances of Ustinov, Ryan, and Stamp--has yet to be released on a real studio-mastered DVD. This version is unbelievable! It appears that someone ran the old VHS copy through a DVD dubbing machine and called it good. The disc itself looks like a bootleg: computer-burned (purple dye), no menus or even chapter stops, so you can only fast-forward through the film to jump to specific parts. It's also been cut by about 3 minutes (presumably to fit just under 2 hours--though the disc could hold more, having been burned at \\"LP\\" quality, not \\"SP\\"). Billy Budd is such a perfectly made film, that any cuts are detrimental and very noticeable. It's also squeezed into the 4:3 format (it was originally filmed in widescreen Cinemascope), and no one, of course, bothered to clean up the film. The whole DVD is a mess and not worth the 20+ dollars it's going for. Unfortunately, it's the only version available--which is a crime! Whoever has the rights to this masterpiece, please do a decent job on it and release it!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|If you've never listened to the Muddy Waters versions of Rollin and Tumblin and Trouble No More you should check them out. Muddy Waters was a genius, too. <br />As for analyzing Mr. Dylan -- do any of us know what on earth we're talking about?  <br />I ran out and got this CD because I liked Love and Theft. And I liked Cross the Green Mountain.  I like this one, too. This is more musical than many of Dylan's records and it's funny and bleak at the same time -- a pretty cool trick.

B00005A0V0|5.0|So, why does an album sound so incredibly fresh & alive well over thirty years after its release? Well, if there was an easy answer everybody would be doing it, but sometimes things just work... and Caravan's masterpiece does just that. First time through its bizarre, often childish lyrics may leave you feeling that you've dropped into a whimsical Edward Lear-esque hippy-fest... but careful because it'll get to you, and once it does you'll be hooked. Why? Well in addition to being infused with catchy melodies, perfectly metered lyrics, excellent playing, clever arrangements, and a highly distinctive feeling of pastoral \\"Englishness\\", there's something running through it all that elevates it from an interesting, relatively obscure slice of early 70's folk-jazz-rock into a \\"classic\\". Don't ask me what but it's different, unforgettable and above all timeless.
B000000H66|5.0|simply, this album can do no wrong. There are no complaints to be found here, as chuck's jaw-dropping riffs explode from one song to another, complimented by the insane twists and turns the drummer gene hoglan spits out during the time changes of each masterpiece. It is mind-boggling how the bassist seems to keep up with chuck and the drummer, and also the chucks vocals sound perfect because they seem to get higher pitched with every album and this album holds the perfect balance, with interesting lyrics to boot! Really, this album (and pretty much this band) defines death metal and technicality. It can be said that Schuldner created death metal with scream bloody gore and now he's refined it with technicality and melody to become this landmark album. Each song flows flawlessly into the next from the terrifying title track to the atmospheric \\"empty words\\", to the purely awesome \\"crystal mountain\\", and closing with the brilliant \\"perrenial quests\\" (the main riff being one of the best on the album), which clocks in at 8:21.  Actually, every song seems to get better as the album progresses, although i've listed the memorable ones already. If you already know death (you should own this) then this will surprise if it is unowned. If you are getting into Death metal I suggest started with scream bloody gore and moving up the death timeline from there up to sound of perseverance which will blow every other album away except this own.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This is a rare TV show: intelligent, moving, well-written and absorbing.  Having obtained the first season on DVD and watched the odd episode on TV afterward, I had to have the remaining three seasons.  For those who are similarly addicted, go to [...] and get the whole four seasons.  Not cheap, but not available anywhere else.  And worth it...
B000002G7E|4.0|First, a little disclaimer: There are some people who will most likely HATE White Light/White Heat, and should avoid it:<br /><br />People who are fans of makeout music. If you're trying to get someone \\"in the mood\\", don't play this record unless your significant other is completely insane (or Sister Ray, for that matter).<br /><br />Those who believe rock is the devil's music. Songs like... well, the entire album will only further your belief that rock is hell's equivalent of elevator music.<br /><br />Those who do not like their music LOUD. Their heads will probably explode.<br /><br />Those who are not VU fans. Since even some fans of the group despise White Light/White Heat, I can't picture a non-fan liking it.<br /><br />As for the rest of you, srap yourself in because you're in for a helluva ride...<br /><br />The album kicks off with the mutated 50's rock/R&B title track, an ode to popping pills. It's one of the best things the group has ever done, no doubt. A pounding piano, hyperactive vocals... pure ENERGY. I love it. The next two songs (novelty The Gift and Lady Godiva's Operation) I could take or leave. The Gift gets points for being weird, but outside of that it's little more than an endless shaggy-dog story that more likely than not won't call you back for repeated listens. Lady Godiva, meanwhile, is just an average song ruined by Lou Reed's awkward vocal interjections near the middle. That said, John Cale's vocals are good on both songs. Enter Here She Comes Now, a ballad with the usual perverted lyrics that's highly entertaining.<br /><br />Flip the record over, and prepare for some sheer volume. This isn't the volume all you MTV kids are spoiled with, mind you. This is the kind of volume that will send Ozzy Osbourne running to his bedroom in tears, the kind that will have Jimmy Page crying for his mother, the kind that will have the entirety of AC/DC yelling at the Velvets to \\"TURN THAT S*IT DOWN!\\" It's pretty extreme. First off is I Heard Her Call My Name, a wonderful mess of perversion and distortion. Then, to cap it all off, all seventeen glorious minutes of Sister Ray. That's right, the notorious Sister Ray. If a long, noisy jam concerning sex, drugs, murder and various other evils that are best left unmentioned doesn't strike fear into your heart and you're not a member of the Velvet Underground, I have reason to worry about you. Oh yeah, and it's loud. Very, very, very loud. So loud, you'd better make sure your house is firmly attached to its foundation.<br /><br />Okay, to all potential newcomers: do NOT start here. In fact, make this your last VU purchase. The self-titled third album is their best, and a good starter: if you like what you hear, VU and Nico's a good buy. If not, try Loaded. And if you've bought VU and Nico, you should still buy Loaded. Then pick up White Light/White Heat, but only if you're a daring listener who doesn't mind volume and lyrical perversion in the same record. And if you don't, why the hell would you listen to the Velvets in the first place?rsion and distortion. Then, to cap it all off, all seventeen glorious minutes of Sister Ray.

B00000JPYQ|5.0|This is not only a seminal live album but it also works very well as a greatest hits compilation. For the casual listener, every song you would need to have is here. There's no weird stuff, they just rip through all of their best songs.<br /><br /> I attended the Chicago portion of the cd and it was a fun show. They were not amazing entertainers in the same vein as a AC/DC or Led Zeppelin but they did play with efficiency and grace. They did not prance around on stage but rather attacked the songs like a punk rock band.<br /><br />The reason why they never achieved the fame that they should have is b/c Michael Schenker their creative force was also their sabateur. Who in their right mind quits a band on the eve on hitting it big?<br /><br />They would have pre-empted Def Leopard/Bon Jovi as the leaders in melodic metal.
0807126063|5.0|One reading just isn't enough to do justice to this, yes, masterpiece. <br /> <br />I've lost count as to how many times I've read ACoD, but it's probably around ten now, and every subsequent reading brings the genius of this novel into a little higher relief. <br /> <br />A superficial reading will give you a few laughs.  Another reading will give you a pretty good feel of New Orleans.  Another one will add a dimension of sadness to the more obvious shortcomings of the several flawed or loathesome characters.  By the fifth or sixth reading the loathing will have turned to a begrudging affection. <br /> <br />By the eighth or ninth reading, you will be so familiar with the work you will begin to understand the genius of the moving parts contributing to something that utterly defies classification -- and you will be astounded by how far above and beyond the sum of its parts is ACoD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000006SGT|4.0|This is a prime collection of their early, very R& B influnced work. They were just finding themselves and expanding into similar covers that other gritty Brittish bands were exploring. You can never go wrong with any Animals recording. This is very primal rock and roll. The sound quality is good for such old, presumably remastered or rediscovered recordings
0385338694|5.0|I would like to have the guts to do what she did, have a perfect career and get on the train and start from the scratch in very unfamiliar new environment - as a housekeeper and still managed to be funny! I guess she did not think so.  <br />Honestly, this was very delightful reading.  <br />You can totally identify yourself with her in many situations as I did.  <br />I liked it from beginning. Complete page-turner. You can always find something interesting on every page. <br />
0312995423|2.0|This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again.
B00007ELEL|5.0|The main character, Lebowski, is a bum of a person living in Los Angeles who spends most of his time either doing nothing or bowling with characters played by John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. Suddenly Lebowski's life is changed when he is mistaken for another Lebowski who is much wealthier than he and who as gotten involved with a group of unsavory characters.<br /><br />The plot evolves as many other Coen movies (Raising Arizona comes to mind) as we are introduced to more-and-more colorful characters and the plot gets more-and-more outrageous, yet somehow still seems real.<br /><br />My favorite component of this film is the character played by John Goodman, a Polish Viet-nam veteran who converted to Judaism after marrying his ex-wife. He has a hair-brained plan to help Lebowski extricate himself from the mix-up mess and he doesn't bowl on Shabbos. He also baby-sits his ex-wife's Pomeranian when she goes out of town.<br /><br />If you liked Raising Arizona you'll want to watch this movie over and over again.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|Not only a gorgeous remastering of the original Eat a Peach album, this rerelease adds on disc 2 the complete final Fillmore East concert.  The recorded sound is even better on the complete Fillmore show: what a disc! <br /> <br />As I understand it there are, in the vaults somewhere, five complete Allman Brothers shows recorded by the original band at the Fillmore East.  So for thirty years Allmans fans have been waiting for those shows to be released, and now at last we have one of them.  Some sunny day there will be an expensive box set containing all five Fillmore shows along with dozens and dozens of good photos of the original lineup...
B000H7JD4K|5.0|this album rocks! it deserves 5 stars.......Way better then 03's Dance of Death....And up there with some of there best albums, YEAH SERIOUSLY!
B000CNEO1G|4.0|Balsom delivers an attractive disc here, with her impressive technical skill and a sophisticated seriousness of purpose in her programming, but there's something important missing from this album.  Balsom plays with magnificent virtuosity, but she presents no message, no artistic voice, no aesthetic philosophy, no unique understanding of or approach to these works of J.S. Bach.  I think she's overly preoccupied with proving herself.  There's a Carnival of Venice sort of character to this disc: bars and bars of sixteenth notes flow effortlessly from her trumpet, and then bars and bars more, but for all that you get no sense of a distinct musical personality.  (Her tone is very French as well: focused and bright.  You can hear that she's been taking Håkan Hardenberger pills.  Personally I'm not fond of this sort of trumpet sound, but I understand that it's a matter of taste.) <br /> <br />I have an album of Bach oboe concerti, played by Heinz Hollinger, that's similar to Balsom's effort here: flawlessly even, rapid-fire delivery of difficult lines is emphasized.  But what Hollinger communicates that Balsom doesn't is a certain idiosyncrasy, a sense that only Hollinger could play those pieces quite like that, even if another oboist were to match his tempos.  Even Wynton Marsalis -- who was often criticized for being mechanical and stylistically daft in his classical recordings of the '80s -- evinced an amiable flair and attitude that Balsom here lacks. <br /> <br />Listen, for example, to the slow, lyrical movements: the sarabande from the D minor cello suite, say.  This is the sort of music through which an instrumentalist of consummate artistry -- a Milstein, or a Fournier -- could explore his own aesthetic vision while at same time revealing to us the sublime depth and breadth of Bach's artistry.  With Balsom, though, there's no insight... it's all very pretty and she really means it, but you can't say much more about her reading.  Not having hundreds and hundredsof notes to keep track of in this movement, she seems a bit unsure of exactly where to direct her energies. <br /> <br />Even so, I think that a musician must be of immense skill to merit this sort of criticism at all.  Lesser players delight for being very good; Balsom here disappoints just a bit because her playing hints at true greatness but isn't quite there.  Balsom is a magnificent player lacking a distinct voice, and if she develops one she will become one of the most important instrumentalists on the scene.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|If you hold this film to Gilliam standards of course your going to say it was lacking. However, try and hold it to the standard set by other films. Compared to 90% of the garbage being churned out this is an excellent film.<br /><br />I judge a film by its rewatch value, and I could definately watch The Brothers Grimm a few times in a lifetime. Compared to Time Bandits, Brazil or Fear and Loathing...yes its not as good, but compared to Date Movie, The Village and a few unmentioned others this is a classic.
B000069AUI|4.0|I am not going to rate this particular album as compared to the other two Coldplay releases as they are all essentually the same quality.  I really find that I enjoy listening to Coldplay, however it took a while to figure out why.  I have decided that Coldplay represents to me what I miss from yesteryear on the radio, however, there is nothing groundbreaking or unique about Coldplay's music.  For those younger people who believe Coldplay is the next this or that, well, they aren't.  I think my biggest problem with Coldplay is they lack an identity of their own, which is why there is so much debate on who they sound like.  Throughout their collection, I hear U2, Dave Matthews, Depeche Mode, the softer Smashing Pumpkins, and even Soundgarden (Daylight).  Maybe it is commendable that they remind me of so many other bands, as it suggests they are not one dimensional.   <br /> <br />My other complaint is that the singer is like so many of today's weak sounding leads.  You can barely hear him over the music and rarely can I make out his lyrics.   <br /> <br />That being said, they are an enjoyable band that is worthy of listening to and are certainly a breath of fresh air as compared to the one-hit wonders and hip-hop garbage that flood our airwaves today.
B00005JO1R|5.0|With the recent flood of biopics (Ray, Capote, Finding Neverland, etc.), I feared that this latest entry would be another painfully predictable story, especially since I already knew Cash's story. Luckily, my fears were never realized. Walk The Line is an exceptional movie (much better than Ray, a movie that always demands to be compared with WTL). Joaquin Phoenix completely nails Cash, and vividly and effortlessly depicts Cash's struggles and triumphs. He creates an empathy for Cash that few movies can rival. Reese Witherspoon is spectacular as June Carter; she brings to light the extreme impact her friendship had on Cash, and plays an important role in saving him from his drug addiction. Overall, this is one of the most enthralling non-fictional movies I have ever seen, and I highly recommend it.
B00000DG1R|5.0|This has every good and great song Duran Duran has done to date. <br />It even has the recent hit Come undone. <br /> <br />For the beginner Duran Duran fan this has all you need and all songs are worth playing. <br /> <br />For me this is a perfect replacement for all my old Duran Duran albums (yes those black round flat things).  It only takes one slot in my CD changer and has all the good stuff I want from Duran Duran. <br /> <br />It has trimmed down versions of Save a prayer and Hungry like the wolf.  Which to me is great, I prefer the shortend radio edits. <br /> <br />Excellent greatest hits disc and excellent value.
B000002572|5.0|First of all I want to correct a previous review that states that BOSTON introduced the \\"Wall of Sound\\" technique. Certainly not! Anyone who knows music knows that Phil Spector is credited with the \\"Wall of Sound\\" recording technique that was prominant on The Beatles' Let It Be and even more prominant on George Harrison's All Things Must Pass which were released long before Boston. I really don't even think that this record is an example of the Wall of Sound technique or even similar. <br /> <br />Anyhow, this record may very well be the greatest rock n roll record ever made.  One day I looked at my CD collection and thought that if I could only listen to one of the CDs for the rest of my life and had to throw away the rest, which would I keep?  While it is a difficult question to answer unless you truly must make such a decision, this first Boston record is absolutely in the 3 to 5 I would narrow it down to.  I was eleven years old when this record was released and I cannot imagine my life without it. It has simply brought so much listening enjoyment over the years and still brings so much energy and pleasure 30 years later.  <br /> <br />I just purchased the remastered version and will give my review in a few weeks after I have had opportunity to hear it with the headphones. <br /> <br />Of any record in the world, I can say that this one will be enjoyed by fans of every music genre.  I don't care if you like jazz, hip hop, rock, heavy metal, classical, blues, reggae or whatever; your ears will not deceive you.  You WILL like, if not love, this record. <br />
0761944524|5.0|Statistics books are either too hard or way too basic for non-statisticians. <br />Statistic-Software books just tell you how to run tests, but they don't help you understand what you are doing. <br />Don't let the book's title fool you: this book is about statistics first. Only after you have the information about what you need to do, it tells about how to do it in SPSS. The explanations are awesome, and the style, although a little too informal at times, makes it easier to read than any other statistics book I've ever read. <br />I just missed a section on random factors for the general linear model.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|After reading GK1981's (September 2006) review i couldnt have said it any better myself. His song comparisons are dead on. I tried, oh did i try to like this album. I just could not get into it. I have liked just about every other pj album thats come out, but i cant get into this one. Its okay to admit that your favorite band has lost their touch!
B000000XB9|5.0|This compilation is timeless. I like to kick back get the grill going invite friends drink some beers and but on this CD and the whole day would be outstanding.
0446677450|1.0|First off, Kiyosaki was a financial failure who made his money writing this book and endorsing get-rich-quick pyramid schemes like quixtar (a warmed over version of Amway.) <br /> <br />This book wasn't worth the money I paid for it, much less the time it took to read it. It contains no good advice that couldn't be summed up in two paragraphs and plenty of bad advice and worthless filler.  <br /> <br />You will be dumber for having read it and may God have mercy on your soul.
0393327655|5.0|It's remarkable that someone working on his Ph.D. found time to write this book.  Having said that, I thought it could have been much longer.  I would like to have seen a more thorough exposition of inherent violence in specific Christian-based sects (Catholicism, Protestantism, Latter-Day Saints and so on) as well as inherently vindictive behavior in religions such as Scientology. <br /> <br />The subject also deserves a broader historical review.  I wished the author had traced religious violence to its earliest roots, as in Joseph Campbell's \\"Primitive Mythology\\". <br /> <br />But the reason I wished for a longer book is because Harris articulates his arguments nicely.  I simply want to see more.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|What can I say, I have been listening to Maiden from the very onset in the 80's.  So yeah I am a bit of a fan boy but I don't just automatically like every album that each of my fav bands put out.  I have had some disappointments along the way but Maidens new album 'A Matter of Life and Death' isn't one of them.  To me this album sounds really fresh and inspired.  And despite the albums very few minor flaws, it's great to hear that Iron Maiden still sound this great, this METAL!!! after all of these years. <br /> <br />I have seen a lot of mixed reviews for this new album especially by the album critics.  And there are always some that will only like the Maiden of the 80's and nothing else.  That is fine, to each there own, there loss IMO.  I am of the opinion that since Dickinson rejoined the band Maiden have been creating albums of equal quality to the 80's years.  Certainly I feel this new one and BNW stack up for sure. <br /> <br />I really like the live sound of the album.  At first I was sceptical of them not using more modern recording techniques or using a producer like Andy Sneap that has a pulse on getting a real modern metal sound.  However Kevin Shirley does a good job here of capturing the essence of what the band is all about.  The album really does sound great!  I still would like to hear the guitars louder in the mix though.  I mean I don't mind hearing Harris's terrific bass lines loud and clear but I still wish the guitars were more in the forefront to add that extra power.  Oh well, the guitars do seem a tad bit louder than on the last 2 albums though.  Exceptions being 'These Colours Don't Run' and 'The Pilgrim' the guitars are just too low in the mix period. <br /> <br />Overall though I just love this album!  Songs like 'Different Worlds' 'Brighter Than a Thousand Suns' 'The Longest Day' 'TROBB' and the albums high point 'FTGGOG' just make me proud the be a Maiden fan!  And though I have gravitated to more modern bands like Nevermore, Pyramaze,Evergrey, Brainstorm, Tad Morose, and Mercenary to get my Metal fix, it's great to hear that Iron Maiden can still sound so relevant in 2006.  Megadeth, your up next....
B000FUF6QS|4.0|Long considered an underappreciated horror classic, THE WICKER MAN is a slowly brooding thriller filmed with quiet reserve by Robin Hardy, from a script by Anthony Schaffer (SLEUTH).  Edward Woodward stars as Police Investigator Howie who goes to a remote privately owned island called Summerisle to investigate the alleged disappearance of a young girl.  Once there, he finds himself appalled at the sexual mores of the community and their heathenistic religious beliefs.  When he meets the lord of the island, one of Christopher Lee's most unusual roles, he finds there is more to this island than meets the eye.<br /><br />THE WICKER MAN is not gory and actually has little horror action until its frenzied conclusion, but it is a disturbing look at clashing religious values.
B000002G60|5.0|This is one of those incredibly under-appreciated albums that shows that true art and poetry are still being created.  Suzanne proves that love songs can be incredibly mysterious with the use of strange settings and metaphors.  \\"Honeymoon Suite\\" has a haunting tone, which is so rare in more recent pop music.  \\"World Before Columbus\\" is my personal favorite (and one of my all-time favorite songs).  With wonderful metaphors, it deals with everything from world history and greed to love and a desire to live and feel more deeply.    Other passages delve into fears, darkness, and issues of mortality (e.g. \\"Birthday,\\" \\"Headshots,\\" and \\"Tombstone\\").  \\"Thin Man,\\" I discovered, refers to the skeletal \\"figure of death\\" (i.e. the Grim Reaper) mentioned in the liner notes.  The song is remarkably similar in imagery to Emily Dickinson's \\"Because I Could Not Stop for Death.\\"  These themes are balanced, though, by periodically upbeat and jazzy songs, some with racy overtones (e.g. \\"Caramel\\" and \\"Stockings.\\")  As always, Mike Visceglia's base-playing and the other instrumentation are as good as it gets.  It is difficult to imagine a more beautifully written and arranged single-disc album.
B000G759FS|5.0|I was thrilled by the performance of Bob James on the piano and by the totally new vocal style of Randy Crawford.  <br />I keep recommending this album to everybody. It is a must to have!
1842171593|5.0|I have both the first and the current editions of this utterly invaluable book.  It is undoubtedly the best and most detailed discussion of Roman military equipment available and it is a \\"must read\\" for anyone interested in the subject, be he or she an historian, re-enactor, artist or whatever.  I would give this book six stars, but there are only five available.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Dont pass this album up! It is far superior than most of Maiden's recent releases. I love 'These colours dont run', 'The Longest Day', 'The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg', 'Different World' & 'Lord Of Light'.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I love every Track.  Every track is great.  I got this cd the day it came out.  If you like Maiden or love them you will love this disc.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|I was really excited about this movie, as I've played the Silent Hill game and loved it. It's really sad when the video game had more plot than the movie did. <br /> <br />It might have been better if they'd done the plot to Silent Hill 2 where a man comes to Silent Hill because his dead wife is sending him messages to meet her in Silent Hill. That would make more sense than the thin plot of this movie. <br /> <br />While the sets were exactly as in Silent Hill, you really need more than that to make a good movie. You need a real story. And this one doesn't really have one. <br />
B000H7JD4K|2.0|As a few others here have stated, I am surpirsed at the number of positive reviews this is getting.  Maybe it is because it is their favorite group and don't want to say anything bad about them but I've been a fan of Maiden since the mid 80's and this album is just another disappointment to me like Dance of Death. <br /> <br />When Bruce rejoined Maiden for Brave New World I was shocked at how good that album really was.  Sure it has some throwaways on it but overall it was a solid release.   <br /> <br />With the constant updates on Maiden's website during the making of DOD, all we heard was how epic this album was going to be and how there are songs like \\"Journeyman\\" that are so different from anything they have ever done before.  Well, the result of that album was the punchline for a lot of jokes among my friends.  The lyrics were just plain silly, especially on the title track, and the songs all followed the same pattern of repeating the chorus a thousand times. <br /> <br />Again, with the making of this new album, all we kept hearing was how great this is going to be and how it is the most progressive album in years from Maiden.  OK, that should have been the warning. Since when has Maiden been considered progreessive?   <br /> <br />Well, I thank Maiden for not following the same format of repeated choruses, but I didn't ask for them to be removed completely!  The problem with this album is that it is following a different formula, one that doesn't grab your attention.  Most of the songs start off slow and \\"dramatic\\" and then jump into heavier and faster paces.  This becomes very boring early into the album.  There are few \\"catchy\\" choruses throughout the album with most songs just dragging into the next song.  Also, why do most of the songs have to be 7+ minutes.  If the song is boring to begin with, I don't want to listen to it for 7 minutes. <br /> <br />One other reviewer hit the nail on the head when it was said that one epic song is enough for each album.  We don't need three, four or five.  And make sure that epic song is actually good.   <br /> <br />This album is very uninspiring and , frankly, boring.  I hope Bruce decides on another solo project soon.. Although Tyranny Of Souls was not perfect, it was still much better than the last two Maiden albums. <br /> <br />
B000G759LW|4.0|A friend of mine recommended I listen to Christina saying \\"She's got pipes.\\"  I'm glad I did!  The sheer force of her voice and the differing moods of the tracks are a great combination.  I'm a new devotee.
0757302661|5.0|I didn't take the hypnobirthing class and I have to admit that I didn't do all the exercises and certainly not with the frequency recommended, so I wasn't surprised that my labor was not completely pain-free.  That being said, to the extent that I did practice the breathing in combination with pain-coping techniques from the \\"Birthing From Within\\" book, I felt very prepared for labor and my birth experience was really positive - I even smiled during labor even though the contractions started at about 5 minutes apart and quickly progressed to 2 minutes apart.  The \\"pain\\" was bearable and I believe my ability to relax with the help of the CD early on in labor made the labor relatively short for a first timer (12 hours).  The staff at the birth center was surprised with how \\"in control\\" I was.  I attribute it to the wonderful explanation in this book of how important it is to relax during labor and my husband and my usage of co-chanting during each surge.  My husband also really helped by coaching me to stay relaxed so our baby can come out and reminding me how each contraction (\\"surge\\") brings our baby closer to us (hypno birthing concepts).  Another helpful thing was during pregnancy not letting people tell me scary birth stories (when someone seemed like they were about to start a scary story I used to say \\"only happy stories please\\").  Reading a lot of positive birth stories was also helpful for me.   <br />To summarize, this book was very helpful for me and I recommend reading various books to have a variety of things to draw on during labor since you don't know what will be the most helpful.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|When I first heard Jet I thought WOW!!!, That is awsome. They have a very unique sound like early 70's. Are You Gonna Be My Girl, Cold Hard Bitch and Rollover DJ are my favorite tracks on this CD. I can't wait for their other CD to come out. Good Job Jet!!!
B000BNI90O|5.0|The following is really all that you need to know about this product: OWN IT. <br /> <br />If the first soundtrack knocked your socks off, you haven't heard anything yet. Even though the first soundtrack is stunning, I was still disappointed that it didn't contain every bit of music, especially all of the music through Lothlorien. But this... it has ALL of it and is incredible to listen to. It gave my chills up and down my spine, and still does everytime I listen to it.  <br />One of my favourite parts of the score is \\"Gilraen's Memorial.\\" The music is so haunting and gorgeous, and the only time I could hear it was in the film, but not anymore. I was beside myself when I learned I could finally listen to this beautiful music whenever my heart desired.  <br />Even if the entire soundtrack is 3 hours long, it is worth listening to every minute of it. It transports you right back into Middle Earth again, which is never a bad thing. <br /> <br />This entire soundtrack is just awesome, in the true sense of the word. The 44 page booklet is also a treat. It explains all the themes from the score, describes the instrumentation and gives you an interesting insight on how this musical masterpiece came to life.  <br /> <br />Howard Shore is nothing short of genius, and if you are a fan of these movies and this music YOU MUST BUY THIS. You will not regret this purchase, I gurantee it.  <br /> <br />PS: Quite possibly the best part of the whole thing is that the booklet reads The Complete Recordings \\"Part One.\\" Which can only mean that they will do this for The Two Towers and The Return of the King. I can't wait until the other two come out.   <br /> <br />
0618001905|5.0|If Leopold looms larger than life throughout this story, why was the book named for his ghost? The last chapter tells the greatest tragedy of all - the \\"great forgetting.\\" After all the spectacular wealth created from the Belgian Congo, after all the benefit to Belgium and all the cost to the Congolese, the story just ended - in the memories of the West. Congo became an independent nation-state in 1971. Belgium dissolved into the European Union. And everyone forgot.<br /><br />What was for several years running a trendy injustice to oppose, simply evaporated from the public imagination. The Congo was a remote and unsexy cause. Even Apocalypse Now, Francis Ford Coppola's big-screen version of Heart of Darkness was stripped of its context, and smashed into Vietnam instead.<br /><br />The Congolese peoples continued to suffer - and \\"Africa's World War\\" of the last ten years in the Great Lakes region of Africa has only exaggerated the sorrows. The region is haunted by King Leopold's ghost. The past is not past where such loss remains unsettled. There has been no \\"great forgetting\\" in central Africa. This book should help the rest of us remember as well, and hopefully bring some healing to the passage of time.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|The best documentary series EVER. I originally saw this as a  kid in the UK, when it was first screened in the mid-70's on ITV on Sunday afternoons. Those unforgettable B+W images of a time only 30 years gone made a massive impact on me back then.    So naturally I wondered if re-watching this series again now might show it all to be badly dated in the post-MTV age. I couldn't have been more wrong. Just seeing the combination of those haunting opening credits along with Olivier's haunting human narration and Carl Davis's moving score all over again felt like a punch in the stomach. In these dark violent times, this wonderful humanitarian series chronicling possibly the only worthy war in mankind's history hasn't dated a bit. Indispensable stuff.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|Maybe I am wrong, but objectively speaking, the best film of that year was Network. But as you must know not always the best imposes by itself, the human factor prevails. I still remember a famous statement in what concerns the fact the last instant before a decision take is always emotive. And so the emotion made this film deserved the coveted statue as Best Film in 1976.<br /><br />Those were hard times, loaded of profound turbulence and social restlessness; Watergate and Vietnam affairs were still turning around the ethic conscious of many people and Network equaled to add even more combustible to that crackling bonfire.<br /><br />Rocky became in this sense a well calculated picture, that found in sports a true cathartic exit; following perhaps the same aims that Bruce Springsteen achieved with Born in the USA; I mean to bring back the extenuated wills, there were other paths to walk and new motives to get along.<br /><br />So Rocky may be seen as modern fable, an urban legend about an unknown and sane guy who wants to shine and get out from the darkness of the anonymity through the box. This original proposal worked out in harmonic synchronization with a devastated generation for so many problems in the life's ring, who felt the sport in these modern times can become a simple guy into a mythical figure, worldly acclaimed, afr from the madding crowd of so many known nasty subjects around.<br /><br />Rocky meant in this decade the new prototype of the success through unconventional roads, taking into account the huge interest of the entire world by four emblematic box figures: Cassius Clay (Muhammad Ali), Joe Frazier and Ken Norton who defeated him and finally Joe Foreman, a still reminded fight that revived once more the syndrom of David and Goliat.<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone simply found the perfect formula and embodied as simulated boxer and new screenwriter, the great desires to triumph, against all the odds.<br /><br />Maybe the only negative aspect must have been the majuscule personal surprise of Sydney Lumet who gave by discounted he would deserve the coveted Prize that never came to him.negative aspect must have been the majuscule personal surprise of Sydney Lumet who gave by discounted he would deserve the coveted Prize that never came to him.                        <br /> <br />
B000G8NY4U|5.0|We were lucky enough to catch this Yanni tour at Radio City in NY. It was simply amazing. Yanni had brought together musicians from around the world who are quite obviously enjoying themselves immensely while taking his music to all kinds of new places.  <br /> <br />Pedro Eustache on various flutes is incredible, and there are several violinists who could each carry the show by themselves but together are just unbelievable. We saw a harp played in a way we had never seen it before, and heard a digeridoo become part of a full orchestra. Just amazing.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth, reknowned for their fantastic style of composition in the Metal scene, introduced to the world an album that cannot be resisted. Damnation.<br /><br />It starts with Windowpane, which exemplifies the mood of loneliness and misery along side with the powerful but clean tone of the drums and the electric guitar. The music is a blend of Jazz and Classic rock. Sweet and soft, however, progressive.<br /><br />If you would like to experience melodies similar to Santana, then Ending Credits is one track that is worth listening to. Pink Floyd's influence can be observed in Weakness, a soft, but evil tune emerging from the organ.<br /><br />The track that I, in my opinion, acts as a foundation for this album is Rid the Disease. Unifying the tune of the piano and the soft distorted guitar. The soft and tender music embraces with the evil and malicious lyric forming an outstanding song that cannot be described by words alone.<br /><br />Do not hesitate to buy this album,
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Star wars, the Matrix, and now Firefly, a new look into the future that not everyone embraces but will be, despite it's short run, a defining vision of science fiction for this generation.  The influence that this series will have on future projects in the genre will be huge.  This is worth the money and worth the time,  it is a great show and a wonderful ride.
0679746048|3.0|At less than 200 pages with medium-sized font, I was able to finish this book in the course of a school day. I was entertained by most, which Kaysen sought to do, although the sections that were supposed to make you think somehow seemed obvious to me -- 'well, yes, that's not right, that's not ethical, no surprises here.' An occasional insightful remark about mental illness is made, but I see nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary about 'Girl.' <br /> <br /> When I finished 'Girl' I saw it more as a piece of dark humor -- this is not a funny topic on its face, although Kaysen manages to make us helpless to laugh at some of the aspects of it and the scenarios it can force one into. She does not take herself too seriously, which I was grateful for, and isn't a crusader -- she simply seeks to show you what her interruption with mental illness was like, and she succeeds. <br /> <br /> Check it out from the library.
B0002I831S|5.0|Great set!  Buying Now is actually cheaper if you buy each complete season separately rather than the 3 in one package.  Do the math. <br /> <br />This edition has not been touched from its original version.  The new release has redone some special effects with new enhanced technology.  I prefer the original release.  Its cheesy special effects is what makes it more enjoyable and is a reflection of its time.  The new remastered effects are too crisp and polished.  This Old Schooler is cooler. <br /> <br />
B000FIMG68|5.0|I missed the entire Season One when it aired.  I rented it on DVD.  I was hooked.  I managed (I don't know how!) to shut my ears and eyes while Season Two aired.  I just bought the Season Two DVD this week and have finished a marathon session of watching it.  I wanted to be \\"adult\\" and try to spread it out over a few weeks ... impossible!  Like a little boy, I was glued to the television set, up until the wee hours of the morning Tuesday night worried about my favorite LOST characters.  I finished watching the season yesterday and the gears of my mind are in overdrive. <br /> <br />Why is LOST so good?  Because it combines some good character-driven writing with some excellent sci-fi story points. <br /> <br />Frankly, I haven't been this giddy over a television show since I was a little boy. <br /> <br />Is it me, or does LOST remind anyone out there of that early 90's adventure computer game, MYST? <br /> <br />Season Two concentrates on PLOT.  If you got used to your favorite characters in Season One, be prepared to give up your comfortability with them -- in fact, one of the themes of season two is CHANGE and how it is inevitable. <br /> <br />The most fascinating episode of Two is the \\"other\\" 48 days ... what happened to the tail section of the plane.  Amazing. <br /> <br />I actually really liked the Ana Lucia character.  Her storyline is complete and like all classic characters goes through a change for the better.  Michelle Rodriguez, I thought, did an excellent job in the role. <br /> <br />As for the existential questions that Season Two raises -- why do we press the button? On faith alone? -- incredible. <br /> <br />And, as all good dramas do, LOST leaves you hanging with a lot of questions that (hopefully) get answered in Season Three: <br /> <br />- Who are the \\"Others\\"? and where is their \\"home\\"? <br />- Libby: in the asylum? giving away her husband's boat?  WHAT'S UP?? <br />- Michael & Walt ... gone for good? <br />- The Hatch ... is it toast? <br />- Why was Locke in that wheelchair? <br />- What happened to Jack's wife? <br />- Why is Charlie acting so giddy? <br /> <br />Oh .... so, so good.  I love LOST.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This is how symphonic metal should sound like! With the release of \\"Once\\", Nightwish have surpassed their last effort (\\"Century Child\\", which i thought would be pretty hard to beat) & have cemented their position as one of the worlds leading symphonic metal bands. For those of you who have written them off as being mere Evanescence copycats, stop living in a dream world and go out and buy this or any of their other albums right now! You won't regret your decision...
B000GFLAI0|5.0|On Sept 6th, 2006 it was announced that \\"Modern Times\\", by Bob Dylan, was the number one cd in America according to Billboard.  Selling 192,000 units in its first week of release.  His last number one album goes way back to 1976 when he released \\"Desire\\".  There is good reason that this cd quickly shot to the top of the charts.  The 65 year old Bob Dylan tattered voice and all, has released a gem of a recording that still showcases his talent as the ultimate folk/rock songwriter.  Don't let the 10 cut cd fool you into thinking this is skimpy.  Unlike the traditional pop recording with its customary three verses per song, \\"Modern Times\\", clocks in at over 60 minutes, and the songs are vintage Dylan storytelling with some cuts noted for several verses in length.  Some of the highlights include, the rocking \\"Rumblin and Tumblin\\", \\"Thunder On The Mountain\\"[a song in which Dylan quite possibly is voicing his affection for singer Alicia Keys].  \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\", is an obvious anthem to the struggles of New Orleans after Katrina.  \\"Workingman's Blues #2\\", is in my mind the best song Bob Dylan has written in the last 25 years.  This sad but catchy ballad is all about the common man getting nowhere.  The back-up band is phenominal, and Dylan has really made something special here, and people are taking notice.  This set of recordings will raise many eyebrows at Grammy time, and it should, because \\"Modern Times\\", is a modern classic that will take its rightful place alongside, some of the best recordings Dylan has ever made.  A very impressive effort indeed.
0753819317|5.0|I read an interview with the author in which he stated his desire to really write a novel that contained within it many elements,mystery,romance,a host of interesting characters,but also written for the modern reader.He succeeds wonderfully.It's fast paced and exciting but also rich and detailed and very wise.One of those books that makes you feel better about your life after reading it.The fact that it contains many tragic moments just makes this feat all the more astonishing.
B000063DHL|5.0|Iron Maiden were the biggest Metal band in the world in 1986. Their reputation had been forged through tireless touring and prolific, high quality, very Metal albums. Having produced five studio albums in five years, and backing them all up with extensive world tours featuring massive live productions must have become tiring. While the band released Metal's greatest double live album `Live After Death' in 1985, no studio album was forthcoming that year. Was there a problem? Was Maiden tiring? <br /> <br />When `Somewhere In Time' was finally released in September 1986, shock horror, Iron Maiden had done something different! <br /> <br />The cover art offered a clue. Eddie had sprouted wires, a bionic eye and a laser, and was standing as a gunslinger in a Blade Runner/Terminator sci-fi cityscape. While not a concept album, like 1988's `Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son', a future shock/passage of time theme connects much of the album. The biggest change was the addition of synth bass and guitars, much to the consternation of long-time fans of the band. The synth sounds of the guitars and bass added to the cyborg feel, combining both the organic and the mechanical. Steve Harris' bass doesn't have quite the same gallop as on previous albums, but the minor change goes along with the band trying to do something a little different. And just because the guitars sounded a bit different didn't mean Adrian Smith and Dave Murray had forgotten how to play them. <br /> <br />While the singles \\"Wasted Years\\" and \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\" were highly successful, neither were instant classics like \\"Number Of The Beast\\" or \\"Run To The Hills\\", but as a whole, this album is far more consistent than the previous three. There are no fillers, like \\"Back In The Village\\" or \\"Invaders\\". \\"Two Minutes To Midnight\\", from the `Powerslave' album would have fitted perfectly on to `Somewhere In Time', perhaps even hinting toward the direction of this album. <br /> <br />There are some great momentsof pure Maiden on this album. Bruce Dickinson's voice is allowed to really soar at times, like on \\"Sea Of Madness\\" and \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\". The latter also features a snare/kick drum pattern from Nicko McBrain to simulate the runner's footsteps. \\"Wasted Years\\" is a song about not wasting opportunities and the brilliant descending scale riff is one of the best the band has ever recorded. <br /> <br />\\"Alexander The Great\\" is one of Iron Maiden's greatest epics. It was also impossible to play live until recent years, because it has so many different guitar lines weaving in and out of each other. The lyrics are a dramatisation of Alexander The Great's conquests, and like great Classical pieces, like \\"William Tell Overture\\" or \\"Hall Of The Mountain King\\", the multi-faceted, layered music also tells the story. Despite Bruce Dickinson having a degree in history, \\"Alexander The Great\\" was written by Steve Harris. <br /> <br />Science Fiction influenced Metal albums are a dime a dozen now, but back when Iron Maiden released `Somewhere In Time', it was innovative and more than a little surprising. Despite criticism levelled at the band back then, and in the years since, `Somewhere In Time' has held up well. Even casual Maiden fans need to hear this album.
0789723107|5.0|This book got me into web usability. After reading a whole lot of other books - it is still my favorite. It's short and gets straight to the point(s). An approach I truly appreciate.

B000G7PMD2|5.0|I was 28 when I first heard of this band. A friend of mine was on holiday in England in 1992 and had sent me a letter in which he raved about a band called \\"Dream Theater\\" who he thought I'd like.     Having grown up on Genesis and Rush (with a healthy helping of Kansas and Jethro Tull) during the late 70's and early 80's, Marillion (ably supported in my collection by Simple Minds, Big Country, Waterboys and U2) in the Mid 80's and (at the time) my latest \\"can't get enough of\\" band... King's X, I knew that my friend knew my taste well and immediately started to ring around the local CD shops to see if anyone had the CD \\"Images and Words\\". Fortunately one store had heard of the CD and had a couple of copies.     Later that week I picked it up and from the first notes of \\"Pull Me under\\" I was hooked.     14 years later and here we are with a 20th Annivesary tour live set (which just fits on 2 CD's for the car by putting \\"Six Degrees\\", \\"Ocatavarium\\" and \\"Metrpolois\\" onto a second disc). (As I do most of my listening in the car to and from work).    For me this set is just brilliant. When I first saw the set list I thought there were a number of tracks missing from what I thought would \\"represent\\" Dream Theater over 20 years. However the set is superb in that it represents the bands history and their latest album with only a couple of tracks that appear on other live albums and the \\"previously\\" unreleased tracks are sheer brilliance.    1. Root of all evil (From Octavarium, 2005) - Stunning version.  2. Walk beside you (From Octavarium, 2005) - a lot more energy than the studio version.  3. Another Won (previously unreleased from 1985 - stunning - like a \\"Rush\\" meets \\"Iron Maiden\\" and uniquely Dream Theater. Far exceeded my expectations.  4. Afterlife (From When Night and Day unite, 1989) - great track (I've never heard the studio album). Far exceeded my expectations.  5. Under a glass moon (From Images and Words, 1992) - Really stunning, was never a big fan of this song, am now!  6. Innocence Faded (From Awake, 1994). Superb version, again enjoyed much more than the studio version.  7. Raise the Knife (previously unreleased from 1996  - really love this song, the band are in great form on this, sound like they are really enjoying doing it. Far exceeded my expectations.  8. Spirit Carries on (From Scenes from a memory, 1999)- the first of 3 songs that have been released live before (this one as part of Live from New York 2000). This is a 9 minute version that is superbly played.    The Orchestra kicks in from here on in....  9. Six Degrees of inner turbulence (the full 42 minute, 8 part version, from Six Degrees..., 2002).   (Parts  III, IV, V and VI were on \\"Live at Budokhan (2004).   I. (Overture - Nice intro with Orchestra). II.(About to Crash - Stunning with band and Orchestra). III. (War inside my head - again, great with band and orchestra). IV. (Test that stumped them all - for me the definitive version, Mike's drumming here is just brilliant). V. (Goodnight Kiss - again great interplay band and Orchestra). VI. (Solitary Shell - the very \\"Solisbury Hill\\" (Peter Gabriel) like track, superb, hard to get out of my head. VII. (About to Crash (Reprise) - Excellent instrumental, perfect for band and orchestra, comes across really well. VIII. (Losing Time / Grand Finale). Rock on lads! This is just great, it's got all the excitement of the ending of 2112 (Rush) combined with an Orchestra. The band and Orchestra are having an absolute blast here. If I had to define the ultimate Rock / Orchestra \\"finale\\" this is it. I can see the progression and hard work that Dream Theater have put in over the years and for me it peaks here and again near the end of Octavarium and the whole of Metroplolis (read on...).  10. Vacant (from Train of thought, 2004). The \\"quiet\\" tune from the ultra heavy TOT album. This is beautifully played and sung, feels , to me, like part one of the \\"intermission\\" type tracks!  11. The Answer lies within (from Octavarium, 2005). Part two of the \\"intermission\\". Beautiful.  12. Sacrificed Sons (from Ocatavarium, 2005). Back into it again, great version of this track with Orchestra and band working superbly together. Again, I feel, superior to Studio version.  13. Octavarium (from Octavarium 2005). I find the keyboard / guitar solo intro (7 minutes) to this one a little too long (reminds me of Pink Floyd's  \\"Shine On\\". (Would have preferred 2-3 minutes max). Also does remind me quite a bit in parts (particularly the vocal style) to IQ's 24 minute classic \\"Harvest\\" (from Dark Matter, 2004). (Which in itself is very reminiscent of Genesis \\"Suppers Ready\\"). Anyway, just minor thoughts in the context of this 27 minute epic. From the 7th minute on this absolutely exceeds all expectations. I think it has much more power than the studio version. It was made for the  ultimate pairing of Rock and Orchestra with the 23 minute mark hitting an emotional high for me.  14. Metropolis (from Images and Words, 1992). (A version appeared on Live from New York, 2000). Have to confess, never a huge fan of this one. (\\"Pull Me Under\\", Take the time\\" and \\"Learning to Live\\" were my faves from I&W). Have to say though, this sums up the whole set. At first glance I thought, mmmm thought there'd be more of the stuff I like, and in the end, wow, I'm glad they put on a whole lot of stuff I wouldn't have chosen myself!. This track absolutely rocks, definitely now a big favorite. Totally exceeded all expectations. Check it out especially from around the 5 minute mark - Rock / Classical / Band and Orchestra - I've not heard better !    Dream Theater have exceeded all my expectations with this release. I'd go so far as to say that I'd add \\"Another Won\\", \\"Afterlife\\" and \\"Raise the knife\\" to my favorite DT tracks.    In regards to \\"six Degrees\\" and \\"Octavarium specifically, the blending of Rock and classical in this live context with an Orchestra is breathtaking. These two tracks are, to me, \\"Classical Rock Masterpieces\\" (in terms of variety / complexity / originality / highest caliber musicianship).     This music as with much of Dream Theater's output over the years is right up there with .... (to think of a few) ...   - Caravan, \\"For Richard\\" (live Version from \\"New Symphonia\\" 1974) (original 1970).   - Emerson Lake and Palmer, \\"Tarkus\\" (title track from \\"Tarkus\\" 1971)   - Yes , \\"Close to the Edge\\" - (title track from \\"Close to the Edge\\" 1972).   - Jethro Tull, \\"Thick as a Brick\\" (Live version from \\"Bursting Out\\" 1978) (Original 1972).   - Genesis, \\"Suppers Ready\\" (Live version from \\"Seconds Out\\" 1977) (Original 1972).   - Gentle Giant \\"Octopus\\" (Live version from \\"Playing the fool\\" 1976) (Original 1972).   - Mike Oldfield, \\"Tubular Bells\\", (Live Version on \\"Exposed\\" 1979) (Original 1973).   - Lynyrd Skynrd \\"Free Bird\\" (Live version from \\"One more from the Road\\" 1976). (Original 1973).   - Rush, \\"Cygnus X-1\\" from \\"Hemispheres\\" (1978).   - Tangerine Dream, \\"Tangram Part 1\\" (Title track from \\"Tangram\\" 1980).   - Frankie goes to Hollywood, \\"Welcome to the pleasuredome\\"   (title track from \\"Welcome to the pleasuredome\\" 1984).   - Marillion, \\"Misplaced Childhood\\" from (1985).   - Queensryche \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" (Live version from 1991). (Original 1988).   - Dream Theater \\"Learning to Live\\" from \\"Images and Words\\" (1992)   - Dream Theater, \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" from (1999).   - Spock Beard, \\"At the end of the day\\" from \\"V\\" (2000).   - Flower Kings \\"The Truth will set you free\\" from \\"Behold the Future\\" (2002).   - Green Day \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" from \\"American Idiot (2004).     Further thought would no doubt reveal more than these classic 18 \\"top of mind\\" favorites. Music, that to me, pushes the musical boundaries in terms of complexity yet still rocks with an abundance of melody and harmony, a difficult thing to accomplish without 100% dedication to create something new, endless practice and commitment. In this live context with an Orchestra, the setting is brilliant.    In recent years newer bands such as Flower Kings, Spock's Beard, Muse, Gomez, Mercury Rev, Elbow, Coldplay, Evermore,  and The Flaming Lips (from \\"Soft Bulletin\\" (1999) onwards) have held my interest, together with any new releases from Dream Theater, Marillion and Rush. This Dream Theater release is a classic.     In summary Dream Theater are are band of extremely talented musicians who can play really complex stuff yet enable it to rock and with melody, harmony and a swagger that defies classification. Hearing what they can play (and seeing it via the DVD) confirms it, these guys are real! Individually they are fantastic musicians, for me the best of the best and together they make something that is simply out of this world. Superb - a stunning 2 Hrs 40 minutes of music, well worth it.    Certainly one of my favourite live albums over the last 35 years (here are some of my other favourites over the past 35 years ...   - \\"How the West was won\\" from Led Zeppelin (1972)   - \\"Made in Japan\\" from Deep Purple (1972)   - \\"Yessongs\\" from Yes (1973)   - \\"Welcome back my friends\\" from ELP (1973)   - \\"Too late to stop now\\" from Van Morrison (1974)   - \\"On your feet or on your knees\\" from Blue Oyster Cult (1975)   - \\"Live in London\\" from Bruce Springsteen (1975)   - \\"One more from the Road\\" from Lynyrd Skynrd (1976)   - \\"Frampton comes alive\\" from Peter Frampton (1976)   - \\"Live Bullet\\" from Bob Seger (1976)   - \\"Seconds Out\\" from Genesis (1977)   - \\"A Live Record\\" from Camel (1978)   - \\"Bursting Out Live\\" from Jethro Tull (1978)   - \\"Two for the Show\\" from Kansas (1978)   - \\"Playing the fool\\" Gentle Giant (1978)   - \\"Waiting fro Columbus\\" from Little Feat (1978)   - \\"Strangers in the Night\\" from UFO (1979)   - \\"Live Rust\\" from Neil Young (1979).   - \\"Paris\\" from Supertramp (1980).   - \\"Exit...Stage left\\" from Rush (1981)   - \\"Under a blood red sky\\" from U2 (1983)   - \\"Stop making sense\\" from Talking Heads (1984)   - \\"Live in the city of Light\\" from Simple Minds (1986)   - \\"Live adventures of the Waterboys\\" from the Waterboys (1986)   - \\"Operation Livecrime\\" from Queensryche (1991)   - \\"Without a safety Net\\" from Big Country (1992)   - \\"Secret World Live\\" from Peter Gabriel (1994)   - \\"Together in Concert\\" from Tim Finn, Dave Dobbyn, Bic Runga (2000)   - \\"Live Scenes from New York\\" from Dream Theater (2000)   - \\"Hullabaloo\\" from Muse (2002)   - \\"Out West\\" from Gomez (2005)   - \\"Instant Delivery\\" from Flower Kings (2006).   - \\"Okonokos\\" from My Morning Jacket (2006)     If this sounds remotely like your sort of music, then go for it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie is crap. End of story. This movie is so horrible that it falls under my list of movies that a destroying the movie business. It's go's right next to the new King Kong and the new Superman movie. I did not laugh ones through the whole movie. I can not understand why anyone in there right mined would think this movie should get 5 stars.
B00001ZWTT|1.0|The \\"Wild Wild West\\" was a five-star TV show. It was so good that you would have thought that the powers that be in Hollywood would be unable to make a one-star mess out of it. But you would be wrong.<br /><br />Casting the African-American Will Smith as Secret Service Agent James West in the place of the German-American Robert Conrad makes about as much sense as casting Justin Timberlake in Richard Roundtree's place as Shaft. Conrad played James West as the perfect combination of a man's man and a ladies man - much like James Bond, except a bit less refined and quite a bit more macho.  Will Smith plays a wimpy, wiseguy, thinks-he's-cool-but-isn't James West. Before the film is half over, he'll have you cheering for the villain.<br /><br />And speaking of the villain, in another piece of PC casting, the Hispanic dwarf, Dr. Miguelito Loveless, of the TV show is transformed here into Dr. Arliss Loveless, a double-amputee, Confederate flag-waving, Southern White. NO MINORITY VILLAINS ALLOWED!<br /><br />Combine the poor casting with an especially inane script, and it all makes for one of the worst films of 1999. Despite all of the explosions and special effects, it still manages to be boring.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|Aeon Flux is a good watch for anyone who enjoys lots of action(and the fact that a woman is doing the butt kicking makes it an even better watch).  I personally like the storyline about how a virus attacks 99% of earth's population and how they are trying to correct the damaging effects of the cure. I was mesmerized by the screen the whole time it was running. Kept my attention, kicked butt, and left me overall more than satisfied.
0060595183|5.0|I'm not one for hardcore drug recreation, but I'm still very curious about it. I always ask people about their perceptions while under the influence and no one is able to articulate it. I think I have a pretty good understanding now when it comes to the effects of hallucenogenic drugs. I realize each individual has a different experience, but it takes an intellectual with an open mind to even begin to relate it to others. <br />Aldous Huxley is an amazing author, I'd recommed any of his writing to those who are curious about the not so obvious aspects of the world they live in. His method of study is the most intruiging and leads to observations that wouldn't have occured if  he had taken a more traditional approach. He doesn't interview the person who takes the mescaline. He has someone interview him while HE'S high as a kite. The questions were pre-written by Huxley as to allow him more control over the experiment. If he were alive today I can't imagine what he'd have to say about the current state of the pursuit of information... or complete lack thereoof.
B00005JOML|4.0|Depite the fact that the movie did have a few weak scenes that just didn't work for it, I thought \\"Miami Vice\\" was pretty good.  This ,I sure, will rank with Micheal Mann's \\"Ali\\" as not one of his best works, but not bad either. The problem lies in the fact that the movie is nothing like the tv show. The movie is dark and gritty, while the show was campy, set in the 80's, partly about fashion, and cars. And maybe perhaps the movie would've played out better if it was more like the tv show, fans and movie goes might've responed more positively.  I like Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx, but they're not right for Crockett and Tubbs.  Josh Lucas (who did 'Poseidon) and C.S.I.'s  Gary Dourdan would've been perfect. I'm also very interested in what the 2hour 49 min version of \\"Vice\\" was like.  The version that was receviced very pourly at test screenings, because you could see in parts where they probably has cut a scene out, plus the ending felt very erupt.  As I already have said it's not a perfect movie, but I still liked it. ****Fans of the television series be warned.
B000002JNG|5.0|It's now past 15 years for this albums release. I had forgotten it until a summer clean out revealed my copy sitting in a box. The jacket was smashed, but the CD was in good shape, so I reboxed it. Rather than just throw it back in another box to fade away, I decided to give it a spin for the first time in 10 years. WOW! What happened to music like this? Real drums, real guitars, with keyboards that add to the drive, rather than act as window dressing or ear candy, real vocals, REAL ROCK? It may be a cliche, but you don't really miss something until it's gone. Rob takes a tip of the hat at \\"Led\\" like the previous \\"Now & Zen\\" on a few tracks here, but it's far from a retread album. The absolutely haunting \\"Anniversary\\" is, to me, an obvious tribute to Bonzo's death ten years before as well as a mention of other people in Plant's life that have \\"moved on.\\"  Plants newer albums just don't seem to have the punch that this has. Maybe that's why I don't buy them like I used to. You can blame age or you can blame creativity that often comes in bursts. Plant was on a roll in the late 80's, and that creative peak is sorely missed by me. This is a good album for those with a taste for classic rock best listened at a full volume.  A steak and potatoes dinner for the ears. No pop fluff here!
B000001Y5D|3.0|I'll give credit to Linda Perry for having a captivating voice(although she does remind me a lot of Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde), and \\"What's Up\\", \\"Drifting\\", and \\"Spaceman\\" are ballads that I never get tired of.  Unfortunately, the rest of the album never really grew on me, and \\"Dear Mr. President\\" is the perfect example of a good instrumental song ruined by cliched lyrics.  Basically, it's the sound of a band trying to make a statement without having anything to say.   <br /> <br />For those of you that liked their one hit, I say try to borrow this before you buy it, and if you hated their one hit, you still might try giving this one a chance because half of the songs follow the same formula as \\"What's Up\\" and the other half sound like a different band altogether.
0767827791|5.0|<br />William Inge's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, PICNIC (1955, Columbia), makes a tremendously powerful and poignant and even romantic movie when directed by the workaholic Broadway director, Joshua Logan.  This was a heyday for Logan, who also made the masterpieces BUS STOP (1956) and SOUTH PACIFIC (1958) over a very short period. <br /> <br />Clearly filmed on location and richly evoking small-town middle America on Labor Day day and night, PICNIC involves a drifter named Hal Carter (William Holden) climbing out of a train boxcar to look up his own college roommate, Allen Benson (Cliff Robertson), who is in the grain business with his rich father.  But Hal first gets involved with several members of the Owens family:  lovely grandmother Helen (Verna Felton), hardworking mother Flo (Betty Field), oldest daughter Madge (Kim Novak), and younger daughter Millie (Susan Strasberg).  On the sidelines, and almost stealing the movie, are Oscar-nominee Arthur O'Connell as a general store owner named Howard, who is engaged of sorts to Rosalind Russell, as a school teacher named Rosemary. <br /> <br />Daniel Taradash, who found a way to adapt FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (1953) a couple of years earlier, did the superb script on PICNIC, which gives us complex characters and interesting conflicts.  Watch how Madge, engaged to Allen, gravitates to Hal at the same time she is crowned queen of the town during the greatest Labor Day sequence ever put on film (the 1957 PEYTON PLACE is a close second).  The romantic and Oscar-nominated \\"Moonglow\\" is from PICNIC.  Note how Allen grows to despise Hal during the movie.  Meanwhile, Millie is always in the shadow of Madge (\\"Madge is the pretty one, Madge is the pretty one.\\")  I believe that Susan Strasberg was Anne in DIARY OF ANNE FRANK on Broadway around this time, and also Marilyn Monroe's friend.  And watch how nuanced Russell and O'Connell are as, respectfully, a teacher who hates booze and just has to be married because she is terrifiedof dying a spinster, and a store owner who is frightened of marital commitment and loves his booze. <br /> <br />The credits on this movie are staggering.  Besides director Logan and writer Taradash, the lush Labor Day sequence (note that name \\"Neewollah\\" for \\"Halloween\\" spelled backwards) was filmed in CinemaScope and Technicolor by James Wong Howe; Oscar nominee Morris  Stoloff composed the beautiful score; and the editing won an Oscar, as did the art direction/set decoration by Broadway legend Jo Milzener.  Holden and Novak dancing to \\"Moonglow\\" has to be one of the most romantic moments of 1950s cinema. <br /> <br />How does it end?  Is there a wedding, and for whom?  Does Madge choose Hal and freedom outside this town, or Allen and guaranteed wealth in this town as her mother hopes?  And isn't Verna Felton's Helen just about the most likeable grandmother in maybe movie history?  PICNIC is a wonderful and thoughtful human interest drama and a lovely valentine to small town America.  (REVIEWED ON LETTERBOXED VIDEOCASSETTE.) <br /> <br />
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|It seems that of all System of a Down albums, Mezmerize gets the most criticism from the avid fans.  In a way that is understandable, because this is not the same sound as they had on their self-titled debut.  Having said that, there is a difference between a band changing their sound, and selling out, and this does not seem in any way like an album full of attempts at MTV singles.  In fact, SOAD arguably experimented with more new ideas on Mezmerize than on any other disc in their catalog. <br /> <br />Personally, this is probably my 2nd favorite SOAD album next to Steal this Album.  Yes, I know I am in the minority with that opinion, but just my 2 cents.
0375830995|4.0|I Am The Messenger by Markus Zusak is the story of a young man who is struggling with his impossibly uneventful life.  Ed Kennedy has never been special, he has never been the best.  His job is to be a cab driver, an occupation for which he had to lie about his age. In his family, he is the only one of his siblings who ever visits his mother, and she treats him the worst.  He is hopelessly in love with his friend, Audrey, who, along with his two other card playing mates, is just as lost as he is.  His life simply is how it is, and although he wishes he would, he won't change it.  Fortunately, someone else changes it for him when he receives the first card in the mail.  On the card are three addresses, and only his wish of a better life brings him to go to these houses.  With fear, excitement, and hope, Ed embarks on a unique journey of self discovery.  This book cannot be lumped into the category of \\"young adult finding themselves\\" books.  Some would say this book isn't about Ed, as much as it is about the people who's lives he changes.  Read this book if you're ready for something that is brutally honest yet delicate and thought-provoking while being comedic at the same time.
B000002LRX|5.0|Although Angel Dust never achieved classic status in the eyes of the public the same way as Ten, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Superunknown, RATM, Dirt, the Black Album, Nevermind, Vulgar Display of Power, or Siamese Dream, I personally feel it is the strongest, and arguably the most influential album of the early 90's.   <br /> <br />One of the things that makes Angel Dust a 5-star album isn't only the sheer quality of the songs, but the diversity.  With songs like RV, Land of Sunshine, Be Agressive, Jizzlobber, and Everything's Ruined FNM experiments with their sound in ways that the average band would not touch with a ten-foot pole.  Of course, damn near every reviewer has said that already, so I digress.  One thing, however, that gets overlooked is the melodic strength.  For an album with such a reputation for being off-the-wall and anti-mainstream, I think songs such as Midlife Crisis, Kindergarten, and A Small Victory could have been potential hit singles, and given the success of their previous album The Real Thing, it's a wonder how Angel Dust didn't manage to get more airplay. <br /> <br />Bottom line, there is a damn good reason this album has a 5-star average.  Do not overlook this chaotic brilliance.
B0000042H4|5.0|Solti is a true Wagnerian!!! There is truly no one better! In every single Wagner recording under his baton (under the fantastic engineering of the Decca label), there is a power, intensity, and ethereal quality that rings true from first note to last. This studio recording of the Ring Cycle is probably his strongest effort. Virtually every nuance that Wagner desired is apparent, from echoes, to characterizations, to instruments used (the steer-horns in Gotterdammerung). All of his singers are nothing short of the best, especially Hotter, Windgassen, and Nilsson (all of whom are sadly not around any longer). They do everything they can to help Solti bring Wagner's deepest conceptions to life. It's a shame that this performance wasn't filmed. The only thing missing is the visual aspect, but that's a very minute matter, when dealing with a top-notch recording like this one. It pulls the listener in, like he's there, experiencing the story with the likes of Wotan, Siegmund, Siegfried, and Brunnhilde. The package is also an excellent bonus, full of very informative liner notes, as well as set designs and beautiful drawings by the great Arthur Rackham. I paid $120 for this box set, brand new, but I would've gladly paid double that, if necessary. I don't know what I would do without this recording. (If you're feeling dangerous, as I have, try listening to the whole thing, with a nice comfortable set of headphones, with only the occasional bathroom breaks and eating/drinking to stay alive. If you can endure such an intense task, you will not regret it, but make sure you follow every word. Everything counts.) 100 stars!!!
B000GTLQXU|1.0|No amount of special effects or star power could save this disaster of a movie and it's horrifically underdeveloped characters.  Drowning would be much more preferable to watching this schlock again.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|When I first listened to the CD I thought it was second or even third of the last three he has made. But after listening to it for a few days I am think it is perhaps the best of the three. It is not a humorous as the second or as dark as the first. Even more than the first it points to someone who is coming to terms not just with aging, but with the end of life which is beginning to come into view. I think he is again giving voice to his generation, where we are getting to the point where both our parents have passed, and while we are not ready to go yet, we can now see a bit of the horizon which in the past was only an intellectual exercise. And yet even with that there is the will to carry on, and carry on with vigor...thus we have lyrics like, 'you think I am over my prime, lets put it to the test'...dont have the lyrics in front of me, but I am sure others will have the exact lyrics.<br /><br />He has also returned a bit to social commentary with \\"Workingman's Blues\\" where he gives his opinion of globalization. In \\"The levee's gonna break\\" there are certainly references to New Orleans, but also I see it as being an extension of \\"Hard Rain Going to Fall\\" in that perhaps we are going through such a rain and indeed the levee's may break. That could be a reach, but the is the wonder of his songs, they are nebulous enough for us to find the meaning that suits us :)<br /><br />I really like almost all the songs on the album, probably the faster ones a bit more but even \\"Beyond the Horizon\\" which has a Hawaiian flavor is good due to the strong lyrics. (Not really a bit fan of Hawaiian music).<br /><br />A number of songs like \\"Ain't Talkin\\" remind me of the way he strung different images together like we saw on his earlier songs like Hwy 61. The other theme that continues is his religious references, which are mostly personal now. So we get things like 'now I see where the scriptures are true.' These flow with the song, again much like is early music but a bit more personal. Always loved the idea that God was telling Abraham that the next time he saw him he had better run :)
B000G759LW|5.0|I didn't think she could do it, but Christina Aguilera has put out the best pop album so far this decade. An amazing and original work of art that showcases those undeniably phenomenal vocals. What a breath of fresh air this album was. Mixing music eras from the 20's, 30's, and 40's with a hip hop feel was pure genius. Every track could be a hit. There are numerous highlights: The best track on the ablum is Mercy On Me, a haunting ballad with Christinas best vocals to date. She sings with such raw emotion and passion she gave me chills. Hurt is a close second with heartfelt lyrics and a powerful vocal. The Right Man is another winner. Song is about her Wedding Day and finally we get to hear a happy, vulnerable Christina. Then there are the party tracks, the gospel falvored Makes Me Wanna Pray and Candyman, which sounds like Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, top the list. Fun to sing and dance too, and crank up whenever the come on and listen to Christina wail. Of course theres the massive hit Ain't No Other Man as well. Theres not one bad song on this album, and hopefully come Grammy time, Christina will be honored. I don't know how she or anyone can top this, it is truly that good in my opinion.
B000GFLE1S|4.0|There are plenty of movies where an actor plays a drag queen but I have NEVER seen a better drag queen performance than Chiwetel Ejiofer's rendition of a man who is sexy and sharp on the outside, yet vulnerable, even innocent on the inside.  When he is asked to help a dying shoe business in England develop \\"boots made for walking\\" by men who like to dress great in drag,  he does so out of tangible friendship for the young owner. I just simply loved his performance, because he lights up the screen - whether dressed as a man or a girl.  What should the company make?  Not mere footwear but \\"tubular sex.\\" Great fun.
0060512806|5.0|The book's heavy - so right away you know its going to be either really good or really bad right?<br /><br />Well, this one's a real keeper.  A story, told from several vantage points across two generations of several families related by blood and circumstance.  There's all the action of a WWII thriller - with fighting in trenches and jungles and taking out pill boxes on remote Pacific islands.  But, for me the most interesting part was the Information Science and the journey into cryptography that Neal Stephenson leads you on as you progress through the book - easy to understand, but quite stimulating to ponder for those neophytes not acquainted with the fields of encryption or cryptography.  There's love stories, crazy geeks with amazing toys and luxury tech equipment and more exciting twists than you'll believe.  There's Gold, Silver, espionage, fighting, and more than I expected when I picked up the book - it kept me gripped from the first to the last page and the story rounded out to the perfect resolution.<br /><br />It was a long read, but Neal Stephenson needed every page to get the story down that he did - and it was worth the investment of time to enjoy the story he crafted for us.  Thanks Neal!<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Dominic Ebacher<br /><br />ebacherdom.blogspot.com<br /><br />060907.0158
B000GFLAI0|1.0|After reading glowing 5 star reviews calling this a masterpiece, I got this album and listened.  I am an old Dylan fan from way back and old and middle Dylan is one of the things that makes me truly happy and I know every song, every line, every story, every story behind the story, so on to Modern Times.  After several listens, I couldn't stand it. The lyrics meant nothing and were so trite that they were Kevin Federlineish.  The music sounded so cold and emotionless, like a band I'd never listen to again.  And all the songs sounded dead, like garbage maybe from Nick Lachey or someone like that.  But Dylan? He should send me a refund, and also pay me for pain and suffering.  I suffered listening to this.  I'm also wondering if I'm insane, since everyone else praises this album so highly.  Or maybe these are just the masses who keep the Olive Garden in business, thinking they serve real Italian food, and who voted for Clinton, thinking he was someone to respect.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|If Dylan's intent was to provide a tour of American roots music,  this effort would deserve 5 stars.  He did much more than that,  and the rating system here doesn't allow for finesse. <br /> <br />Much has been said about how this is the third in a trilogy which includes \\"Time Out of Mind\\" and \\"Love and Theft\\".  \\"Modern Times\\" is similar in feel,  and certainly worthy of comparison,  but I'd hate to think this is the terminus.  \\"Modern Times\\" is one of those pieces of art that you wish were given to children when they start elementary school. <br /> <br />Actually,  after I read the above,  I don't think I can describe it any better.  \\"Modern Times\\" isn't as opaque and confusing as,  say,  \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", nor is it as surreal and Daliesque as \\"John Wesley Harding\\".  It's not a recording that will change the zeitgeist like \\"Highway 61\\". <br /> <br />It's just a recording that you will want to buy for yourself,  and then buy a copy for your parents,  and grandparents,  and children,  and grandchildren,  and whatever other tendrils of relations you have either previous or upcoming. <br /> <br />This one is beautiful.
0452277752|5.0|When Stephen King first started to gain prominence in the mainstream public eye, there were a series of works that were published under the name of Richard Bachman.  Supposedly Bachman was a New Hampshire dairy farmer who suffered from insomnia and spent his nights writing.  After the publication of THINNER, it was revealed that Richard Bachman was actually Stephen King--he had taken on the alter-ego so that he could publish more book in one year.  THE BACHMAN BOOKS is a collection of the first four novels that King wrote under the Bachman pseudonym.  The four novels are:<br /><br />RAGE--this collection is about the only place you can find a copy of the novel RAGE.  After the Columbine shootings King had the book pulled from shelves across the country and didn't want it to be published again.  In the story a very disturbed and troubled high school student, Charlie Decker, in a small town community shoots one of his teachers and takes control of the school.  Keeping the students under a sort-of hostage control, Charlie leads them in an examination of their inner lives.<br /><br />THE LONG WALK--one of King's best novels of all times.  In a future where a dictatorship controls the U.S.A, a group of 100 young men sign up to participate in the nation's favorite sporting event and pastime, the Long Walk.  Walkers participate for a chance at winning The Prize, which is anything you want for the rest of your life.  However, only one person can win and everyone else dies.<br /><br />ROADWORK--a common man stands up against the system and decides to get even before his home is destroyed for the roadwork for a new highway because of eminent domain.<br /><br />THE RUNNING MAN--in 2025 the hottest television show is \\"The Running Man\\".  A man who is pushed to the brink is selected to participate and runs not only for his life, but for the life of those he loves.<br /><br />THE BACHMAN BOOKS includes an introduction by King entitled \\"The Importance of Being Bachman.\\"  In the intro King tells about FBI investigations concerning RAGE, why he wrote as Bachman, etc.<br /><br />Including both some of King's roughest works (RAGE) and some of his best writing (THE LONG WALK), THE BACHMAN BOOKS is a good collection of writing that most fans of King will enjoy.In the intro King tells about FBI investigations concerning RAGE, why he wrote as Bachman, etc. <br /> <br />Including both some of King's roughest works (RAGE) and some of his best writing (THE LONG WALK), THE BACHMAN BOOKS is a good collection of writing that most fans of King will enjoy.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|'A Matter of Life and Death' is IM's 14th studio album and as such it isn't exactly loaded with surprises, but it displays the craft and fundamentally strong songwriting you'd expect from them.  Yes, it's still somewhat different from classic Maiden, with the same epic structures they've favored for the last decade and the new millennium three guitar attack, but it's all a natural evolution of their roots, rather than a substantial reworking.  This is also there most consistent album in a long time, though I'm not necessarily sure I'd say it's better than 'Dance of Death'.  (DoD does have a some obvious filler, but it's one of their most varied and interesting albums ever.)  Anyway, this is an excellent album which is almost certain to please the fans.<br /><br />If 'A Matter of Life and Death' has a notable flaw it's pacing and flow.  7 of the 10 tracks are in the 7-9 minute range and thus tend to vary substantially in speed and loudness and whatnot.  (Furthermore, of the 3 remaining tracks, only 'Different World' is a real all out speed metal number, though 'The Pilgrim' is generally pretty energetic.)  Basically, this means that it's sometimes a bit lacking in energy for a metal album, and even if the various epics are well written, as they are here, they sometimes just drag a bit and could really stand to be placed next to something a bit more straight forward.<br /><br />Some have complained about the production, but I think it's first rate.  Yeah, it's bit raw, but only by mainstream standards.  (This ain't black metal, needless to say.)  Furthermore, with 3 guitars things are bound to either be a bit cluttered, (as here) or excessively clean and separated and less heavy. (As on BNW)  Personally, I prefer this.  Also, I love the drum sound.  Nice and punchy.<br /><br />Nothing here demands to be cut in terms of quality, though I ultimately think this album might be a bit overlong.  (Particularly when considering the occasional lack of energy.)  'Out of the Shadows' is probably the most obvious potential cut.  Things is, I think this song is actually pretty cool, but it's less interesting than anything else here and there is a  helluva lot of material.  (Actually, 'The Pilgrim' is perhaps on the same level as 'Out of the Shadows', but since it's one of the shorter, faster tracks I think it's more beneficial to the album as a whole.)<br /><br />'Different World' is a fine, classic IM opener.  The vox aren't as good as they've been, but it still works and the guitarwork is first rate.  'These Colours Don't Run' is another excellent track.  Though it's 7 minutes long it's still one of the more purely rocking songs, with a nice instrumental sections and great contrast between the chorus and pre-chorus.  'Brighter Than A Thousand Suns' is the first all-out epic, and it's a solid track, if not the best of them.  Again, the pre chorus is great.  I particularly like 'The Longest Day' better, which is legitimately moody during the quieter parts, but it explodes very nicely. (Particularly when if first gets loud.  Too bad that part isn't the chorus, it's better than the actual one.)  'The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg' is the first single, and it seems like a rather odd choice.  (Though this album hasn't got much single material.)  I wasn't much of a fan of this song initially, but I really grew on me pretty fast.  The instrumentation is nothing special, but Dickinson gives some of his best, most impassioned vox.<br /><br />'For the Greater Good of God' is the apparent centerpiece of the album.  It's an excellent epic apart from some unusual phrasing in the overly wordy choruses which sound a bit awkward.  Not too much of a problem, but definitely a bit distracting and I think it could've been avoided easily.  Still, they more than make up for it with some particularly cool and intricate guitarwork.  I've seen 'Lord of Light' accused of being filler, but I seriously disagree.  The softer parts are some of the best they've ever written, both ethereal and menacing, and the chorus is nice and soaring.  Not one of the best IM songs ever or anything, but still solid.  The album closes with yet another epic in the form of 'The Legacy'.  They use some more acoustics here to good affect and this proves to be one of their more delicate and less theatrical epics.  (Which means that it still gets to be pretty damn grandiose at times, still.)  Not as good as some of the earlier tracks, but different enough to not seem redundant, and all in all a fine way to go out.<br /><br />I've written and written, so we'll stop this nice and quick.  This is another very good IM album.  Not on the same level as their very best stuff, but still more than good enough.ey've ever written, both ethereal and menacing, and the chorus is nice and soaring.

B000003S0I|5.0|So much of what is classfied as 'prog rock' is showing its age, and time has not been kind. This opus by the ever- mutable King Crimson only sounds better with the passage of time, and it's taken me years to fully appreciate what Fripp and co achieved with this unusual collection. For someone accustomed to the melodic progressions of Pink Floyd and (occasionally) Yes, LTIA came as a rude shock with its abrupt dynamic shifts and uneasy mixture of delicacy and brute force. This is 20th century contemporary music par excellence, and is undoubtedly an acquired taste. Stick with it, and approach without expectations. This is the greatest example of that much maligned and often misunderstood genre called 'Prog'
B000053VAF|1.0|I should note that I didn't come from a Catholic family, so I'm not in the potential audience for this film.  Never the less, this fact is no excuse for 'Dogma's being as mindbogglingly annoying as it is.  Every character, every damn one of them is agonizingly obnoxious, it's just unbelievable.  Any one of them could cripple a scene all by his or herself, yet there are often many of the on the screen at once.  Take the most involved scene in this film then add in, say, Kathy Griffin and Chris Tucker, and it would cause my head to explode within seconds.  Frankly, I'd probably be better off.<br /><br />Still, every time this thing comes on TV, which is about every other day on Comedy Central, I can't help but watch a little of it.  I don't know why.  Do I hate myself? Am I a masochist?  Or do I have to prove to myself every time I see it that it's really as bad as I think it is?  Suffice to say, this isn't necessarily the worst movie I've ever seen, but I honestly can't think of a single movie that I HATE more than 'Dogma'.<br /><br />Grade: F<br />(P.S. I read that the DVD comes with 100(!) mintues of deleted scenes.  This thought makes me tremble in horror.  It's best not to contemplate such things.)
B000005YZM|5.0|Unlike other reviews, I prefer the Mono mix on this album to the stereo.  I first began listening to this cd in stereo and while the audio quality is excellent, something is missing in the mix.  Meaning, the stereo mix is not very good. <br />But the Mono mix is amazing. <br />As for the album itself, its a classic and the Big Beat version is the one to get.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|This movie does have remarkable dance scenes as one would imagine. That said, the story was very compelling and I found that even though the movie was well over two hours in length, I was absorbed into the action and it seemed to be over too soon! The movie is one of a handful from the 1980s that I have watched numerous times and enjoyed it every time!
B00005JP5J|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine is easily my pick for best film of the year.  At the same time, I won't say that you've never seen a movie like this one before.  It treads familiar territory and dredges up some recognizable character types, like the silent broody teen and the dirty old man, but it doesn't belabor them; instead it reminds us why we find situations and individuals like these so relatable.  It's a road trip movie.  It's a dark comedy, but it's also something else altogether.      There are sight gags a plenty and some dysfunctional family fun that walks a fine line between trite and genius, but I (and 93% of the critics on [...]) believe that the performances tip the balance in favor of genius.  Alan Arkin is extraordinary as the cantankerous, heroin snorting grandpa with a heart.  Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear, as the emotionally fatigued married couple, have an onscreen chemistry that threatens to blow up at any minute.  (Boo!  Kenney, that's such a cheesy line.  You can do better.--I know.  I know.  But I couldn't resist.  Watch the movie and you'll see what I'm talking about.)  And we all know Steve Carrell can be funny, but who knew he could play tortured too.  And here's something that's entirely refreshing: a seven year-old character, Olive, who is more naïve than she is precocious, and an actress, Abigail Breslin, who pulled it off realistically.  She did more than pull it off really.  She sold it, and I bought every tear and toothy grin.      The opening sequence introduces the characters and their particular quirks in a series of one-minute shots, so the audience member knows right from the beginning who these people are and basically what's wrong with them.  Most of their backstories are taken care of around the dinner table, and then the movie literally hits the road when the whole family piles into a cheerfully yellow VW bus to take Olive to California, where she has a chance, by way of the only stroke of good luck in the entire script, to competefor the title of Little Miss Sunshine and fulfill her beauty queen aspirations.    The storyline tackles some grim and seedy subjects: divorce, suicide, drug-use, romantic pitfalls, failed careers, and we don't always get to laugh our way through them.  With this movie, just like in life, you've got to take the good with the bad.  In fact, Little Miss Sunshine accomplishes the nearly impossible and makes us grateful for the tragedies that occur, because that's when we get to see who the characters really are.  Like in the case of Dwayne (Paul Dano), the teenage son whose vow of silence prevents him from talking for the majority of the film.  We don't even get to hear him speak until he experiences his great disappointment, and it's not long after he starts talking that he reveals himself to be much more affectionate and protective of his little sister than his angry facial expressions let on.      You might start to think that Dwayne's got the right idea when you notice that some of the film's best moments are utterly quiet.  Nobody ever says the right thing in this movie.  No problems are solved just by talking them out.  In fact, most of the time talking just leads to more problems.  These characters learn to take action, and they get the job done.  While the results--you can't really call them solutions--aren't always satisfactory for them, for the audience they are never less than entertaining or cathartic for that matter.      Be prepared to laugh, hard and often, so much so that you won't see it coming when it's time to cry.  I realize that at the beginning of my review I made it sound like Little Miss Sunshine might be borderline cliché, but that was just me anticipating other people's possible complaints, certainly not asserting my own.  But regardless of how original you do or don't think this movie is, it delivers some big surprises.  Some of them you might see coming, but I highly doubt you could guess them all--just wait until you find out what Olive'stalent is!        I hate to use the term dramedy.  I choose to think a movie like this one actually collapses genres rather than blends them.  But nevertheless Sunshine offers a good mix of strong emotion and light-hearted farce for everyone to enjoy.  For all you heady types, there's a healthy helping of Proust and Nietzsche in there.  For all you who would prefer slapstick, there's a good dose of that too, along with some pretty funny one-liners as well.      This film has a lot to say about life and disillusionment, expectations and harsh realities, but it says it with a smile and sometimes through clenched teeth.  Its message never gets lost in all the absurdity, and it wasn't lost on me either.
B00003CXAW|5.0|this film was originaly released in 1933 and growsed millions, enough to significantly refund the budget and then some. the movie starts with a movie producer filmiing on an deserted island but its not so deserted. the local villagers kidnap the lead actress and sacrifice her to thier god, a giant gorilla. but the gorilla do's not eat her, instead he falls in love with her and protectes her, even fighting a dinosaur to do so. he is later captured by the filmers in order to put him on broadway for finacial gain. but he escapes and wreaks havok in new york city.<br /><br />great graphics for its time period and the most orginal monster film in history. rent it, buy it, whatever just SEE IT.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|To get to the point, \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" is Maiden's finest hour since their '80's heyday.  This album feautures a power and a purpose that has been largely absent from Maiden's music for years, with \\"Brave New World\\" being a glorious exception, but even then \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" does not give way towards the end (much like Brave New World), and there's not one drab composition to be found, the very kind that marred \\"Dance of Death.\\"  <br /> <br />On \\"A Matter of Life and Death,\\" guitarists Adrian Smith, Dave Murray and Janick Gers play with a sense of melodic, muscular power, bassist Steve Harris and drummer Nicko McBrain push the band harder and stronger than ever before and singer Bruce Dickinson superb vocals underscore the urgency and sense of purpose that permeate the entire album. In addition, Dickinson and Harris have found new wellsprings of lyrical inspiration from that very same sense of purpose, as tracks like \\"Brighter Than of a Thousand Suns,\\" \\"The Longest Day\\" and \\"For the Greater God of Good\\" take on the oft tread topic of war and its consequences with a new, passionate furvor, characteristic of men observing the world with older, wiser eyes.  When Dickinson intones in his still impeccable wail \\"How long/on this longest day/'till we finally make it through?,\\" its' not just the cry of a soldier on D-Day, but the lament of a man observing a world tearing itself apart.  Harris takes a similar cue on the albums' most powerful muciscal and lyrical moment, \\"For the Greater Good of God,\\" a screed against war justified by religion: \\"And after all of this/you'd think that we would learn/but still the body count/the city fires burn.\\"  On tracks like \\"For the Greater Good...\\" and \\"The Longest Day,\\" Iron Maiden display a musical and lyrical passion that most metal bands can only dream of.  After 30 years as a band, with all its' ups and downs, mis-steps and screwups, Iron Maiden prove they can still stir up a intelligent, melodic frenzy that reminds the metal world why they mattered in the first place, and more importantly, why they matter now.
B000FIMG68|4.0|Season 2 opens exactly where season 1 ended.  Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly), and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) are about to enter the mysterious hatch they've been trying to enter for half the first season.  Inside, they find only more mysteries, and a computer that requires their input every 108 minutes.  What do they have to input?  Those numbers that make Hurley (Jorge Garcia) so incredibly nervous.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Michael (Harold Perrineau), Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) are adrift in the ocean.  \\"The Others,\\" whoever they are, kidnapped Michael's son Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) and blew up the raft the three were on.  When they land back on the island, they discover they aren't the only survivors of their plane crash.  People from the tail of the plane are alive and hiding out for fear of \\"The Others.\\"  What does this group want?  Why have they been tormenting the tailies?<br /><br />Over the course of the season, even more questions are raised.  Along the way, we do learn what Kate did that put her on the run from the law, where Claire (Emilie de Ravin) went when she disappeared last season, and why the plane crashed that fateful day.<br /><br />While I loved this season and didn't miss an episode, I found myself disappointed with the first half.  Twice in those twelve episodes, they led us up to an exciting point, only to spend the next new episode revealing back-story that we didn't need and only served to slow the story down.  Then the next week they moved things forward again.  I found these backtracks very frustrating, even for a show famous for their flashbacks.<br /><br />Things definitely picked up in the second twelve episodes, however.  The story began to move forward quickly, still giving us two questions for every answer.  I don't find the lack of answers frustrating.  I just hope my faith in the producers to answer everything before the show ends is justified.<br /><br />Three new cast members joined the show this season.  Cynthia Watros, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and Michelle Rodriguez played members of the tailies.  They proved just as compelling and interesting to watch as the returning cast members from season one.  Everyone brings their A game to their role each week, making the story spring to life and drawing me further into the web.<br /><br />And this DVD set proves just as wonderful as the set from season one.  The video is once again sharp wide screen, and the sound is a very full surround.  I haven't heard any other TV show make this kind of use of the sound.  You are in the show.  If I weren't so addicted to watching it every week, it would almost be worth waiting for the season sets, they're that good.  All twenty-four episodes are presented on six discs.  Along the way, there are five audio commentaries by various members of the cast and crew.<br /><br />Then there's disc seven.  Once again, it is packed full of great bonus material, including deleted scenes, bloopers, character back story filmed for this set, and the making of an episode, to name a few.<br /><br />While this season wasn't as good as the first season, it is still extremely entertaining and better then many shows currently on the air.

B00005QDW5|5.0|Hi. How are you? <br />    I realize that some people will be puzzled by certain track ommissions from 'Echoes' (such as 'Dark Side Of The Moon tracks \\"Speak To Me/Breathe\\",\\"Brain Damage/Eclipse\\",or other tracks from 'Wish You Were Here' like \\"Have A Cigar\\",\\"Welcome To The Machine\\"... Nevermind other key tracks from 'The Wall' such as \\"Run Like Hell\\",\\"Mother\\",\\"Young Lust\\" or \\"In The Flesh?\\"...),but in the huge task of reassembling a running order for over thirty-five years' worth of Pink Floyd material,the band truly did a splendid job not only with their choices of track selections,but in having the two discs maintain a flow and a poignancy..  <br />   Interesting asides about 'Echoes': Both the opening tracks on disc one (\\"Astronomy Domine\\") and the closing track on disc two (\\"Bike\\") are BOTH Syd Barrett-penned (and sung) tracks that also opened and closed Floyd's legendary debut album (and also,the only full Pink Floyd album featuring the late Syd Barrett,'The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn')... <br />   Also,the two discs also have thirteen tracks apiece; reminiscent of the thirteen/thirteen on both discs of 'The Wall'... These awesome twenty-six tracks on 'Echoes: The Best Of Pink Floyd' take you on some wonderful musical journeys...  <br />   I even don't mind that some of the lengthier tracks have been edited some (such as the original 23:00 of \\"Echoes\\" from 'Meddle' to about 16:00)... This works well actually and puts a new frame on a familiar picture,if not a few new colors... <br />The fusing of most of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" into a stirring 15:00-plus minutes is wonderful... <br />   There's nary a track you'll feel compelled to skip overe. Listening to 'Echoes' is like any happening Floyd album: you'll wish to listen to it straight through as an album in itself. <br />   A very sturdy group of choices for songs and -if so- a fitting and apt farewell to the recorded work of Pink Floyd. <br />   Five stars hands down. <br /> <br />   Thanks for yourtime, <br />   Tim Goyer <br />   Albany,NY <br />   USA
B00003CXC6|5.0|Somewhat curiously, Japanese critics were not enthusiastic about RASHOMON when it was released in 1950 Japan.  Today, however, RASHOMON is generally considered to be the film that introduced both master director Akira Kurosawa and Japanese cinema to the west; it is also often cited as the film that prompted The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to create an award for Best Foreign Language film.  It is widely regarded as a masterwork of world cinema.<br /><br />Set in 12th Century Japan, the film's premise is at once both very simple and very complex.  A man is found dead in a forrest, and several people are brought forward to give testimony in the matter.  In some respects their accounts agree--but in numerous others, some obvious and some very subtle, their stories differ.  As each character gives his or her version of events, the various differences pile higher and higher, leaving the viewer to wonder at the motivations involved.<br /><br />Has each person simply interpreted the same facts in different ways?  Do they deliberately lie in order to protect themselves?  Are the differences in their stories deliberate or subconcious?  The film offers no easy answers.  Some have criticized the film for seeming to state that there is no such thing as ultimate truth, but RASHOMON is more complex than this: it is essentially a meditation on our inability, be it deliberate or unintentional, to reach more than an approximation of ultimate truth due to the very nature of humanity itself.<br /><br />Much has been written about the look of the film, which is indeed memorable.  Filmed by Kazuo Miyagawa, it presents the forrest as a living, breathing entity; the images are powerful, the editing remarkable.  No less so are the performances, which require the various actors to shift in behavior as each person involved gives their own account of the event; this is particularly true of Toshiro Mifune, a frequent performer in Kurosawa films, and actress Machiko Kyō.  But whether lead or supporting player, all performaces are equally astonishing.<br /><br />The film has been extremely, extremely influential over the years, and as such it no longer has quite the same \\"shock of the new\\" that it had for audiences of the 1950s; nonetheless, this is director Kurosawa working very close to the height of his power, and while he would create other films that equalled and bested RASHOMON, it remains among his masterworks.  The Criterion edition is quite fine, offering a near-pristine print with your choice of subtitles or dubbing (the former is recommended) and several memorable extras.  Strongly recommended for fans of world cinema.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon ReviewerKyō.

B0009HLDFU|3.0|...but at two discs, feels somewhat bloated and misses the mark of true greatness it could have achieved. <br /> <br />The concept of a \\"Hard\\" and \\"Soft\\" collection sounds promising at first, giving the band the chance to showcase both their hard-rocking side and a more delicate side separately. The problem is, this leads to a certain \\"sameness\\" in the sound to each disc, where one song begins to blend into the next and make it difficult to tell the true winning compositions from those that might have been better left as a b-side release (or simply back in the studio). Too much of a good thing, perhaps...or maybe simply too much of the same thing when a little variety track-to-track would have been more effective. <br /> <br />There are certainly enough stand-out cuts for the listener to put together his or her own great mixed cd. The Hard disc gets off to a blistering start with the title track, which reminds me of The Who with Dave's blistering vocals and Taylor's assault on the drumkit. \\"Best of You\\", \\"DOA\\", and \\"The Deepest Blues Are Black\\" also stand out as instantly memorable and up to the standards of some of the best Foo tunes before. <br /> <br />On the Soft disc, the lyrics really shine, particularly on tracks like \\"Friend Of A Friend\\", \\"Razor\\", and \\"Over and Out\\". But it all begins to sound a bit too mellow after a while, and I for one  could live without ever hearing Norah Jones mixed with \\"my Foo\\", as on the cringe-worthy \\"Virginia Moon\\". <br /> <br />The Foo Fighters are a band I have enjoyed listening to for some time, though I always seem to find their individual albums slightly lacking in consistency. \\"In Your Honor\\" is no exception to this, which is a shame because condensed down to one cd this could have been the best, most impressive collection of Foo Fighters songs to date.
1427200246|5.0|Most of us contemplate change after the most damage has occurred or the moment of opportunity has passed. We simply see it too late. Collectively, in our organizations, families, teams and countries, we keep our heads in the sand, ignoring hints and omens and then denying wake-up calls. This book is a brilliant and delightfully engaging story on how a lone voice of reason or insight can prevail and help us adapt to the future instead of living (and dying) in the past!
B000EULJLU|5.0|I didn't realize who Tool was (forgive me) until my husband wanted us to go to their concert. I figured I'd better get their latest CD so at least I'd know their tunes. Well, if you don't get hooked on the music you'll get hooked on the picture book that comes with the CD. That in itself was worth the money. You could look at each picture a thousand times and still something different. They are the most artistic and creative band I've heard since Pink Floyd. A definate buy!!
B00005JOVN|1.0|I cannot say enough about how awful this movie was. Nothing like the original. The acting was bad, the special effects were obviously computer generated and did not look real at all, I cared about no one on the ship and in fact hoped that they all would drown. Awful, awful waste of rental money. If you want to see Poseidon then please see the original which has a great cast, realistic wreckage, and people you can care for and hope that they live.
B000GIWS7E|2.0|First and foremost, let me say that the true Dream Theater fan would probably buy this D.V.D. irrespective of the rating. That being said, I believe that this is probably the worst recording of a Dream Theater concert available, Budokan, and Scenes from New York, were both of superior quality(J.P.'s tone on Scenes was some of the best ever!)In this recording, John Petrucci is barley audible throughout the entire concert. On a side note, i actually had the pleasure of attending this concert ($100 nosebleed ticket off of eBay)and Petrucci's guitar shorted out right before the solo in \\"under a glass moon.\\"  <br />  If you only buy one Dream theater D.V.D. i would recommend Budokan, because it has the best set list( Although Score has the entire concept album off of Six degrees with an Orchestra, and Metropolis part one) Budokan is like a really good mix tape of Dream Theater Career up until their seventh album.  This one's worth buying, because it costs less than Budokan, and for good reason.  This review may seem kind of harsh, but I expected more from my favorite band. <br />
080701429X|5.0|There is something to be said of a person who can go through a horrific journey such as the atrocities of Auschwitz and recall it with such clarity in order to help others. I was completely emotionally overwhelmed by the first half of the book-which is a narrative of what he experienced and fascinated with the next half which is an explanation of logotherapy.  <br />This is not an overly long or hard book to read in spite of some of the subject matter. My version was a thin paperback that I finished in a few days. It took me longer to fully appreciate because I hung onto each page and felt a responsibility to make sure I understood his journey and how he came to his conclusions.  <br />I recommend this book for anyone.
B000B5XOSO|2.0|Visually stimulating and persistently off-kilter with a few well-acted, stylistically creative scenes (Pfeiffer's return home, the ballroom revelation) but primarily spooky, goofy, and disgusting. Heroism, excitement, and interesting characters are nowhere - and I mean nowhere - to be found.<br /><br />I frequently had to remind myself that I was supposedly enduring a Batman movie. It's hard to remember that when a third of the picture is spent showing a slimy, fanged and flippered midget eat a raw fish whole as the contents of its bowels stream down his chin. All while he's running for mayor. Whee. I completely checked out when they rolled out the all-terrain rubber ducky and the rocket-launching penguins.<br /><br />This film is essentially just two hours of Tim Burton pleasuring himself.
031236198X|5.0|Our Iceberg Is Melting takes a complex, institutional subject -- how organizations change -- and puts it into a simple and accessible form - in this case, a fable. How accessible? It's a 45-minute read, with humor and delightful illustrations. My teenagers picked it up voluntarily, liked the characters, and got the message - that changing how a group does things requires a process, or otherwise the obstacles win. Kotter and his co-author have put Kotter's 8-step change model into reach of any and all. I'm going to leave my copy on my desk at work. It's the perfect business book for those who never thought they'd read a business book.

This edition is great for the commentaries on it and the extra features including Bruce's little doco on fans... a must have for all fans!!!! I am scared they are thinking of remaking this fantastic movie and I just hope Mr. Rami will realize this is a mistake... 'ASH' Rules!!!
B000H7JD4A|4.0|Iron Maiden does it again, releasing another brilliant album two decades after what is often called their heyday. The third studio album into their rebirth (when Bruce Dickinson rejoined the band for 2000's Brave New World), A Matter of Life and Death musically picks up where 2003's Dance of Death leaves off, particularly as Different World kicks off the show.<br /><br />Here we've got more songs with heaven-and-hell lyrics, flavourful intros and outros sandwiching the meat of an antiwar epic (there are several here), and three guitars that at times sound like entire orchestras. The tone changes in the middle of several tracks, often to something unexpected that still fits the overall experience (especially on For the Greater Good of God and the Legacy). This approach makes it difficult to know when one song ends and the next begins, but Life and Death is meant to be heard as one piece of work, which is not the case with earlier albums such as Number of the Beast and concept album Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.<br /><br />While one could criticize that Iron Maiden uses the same ingredients on this album that they used on Dance of Death, there is still a lot to be heard with this approach, and it results in life in a Matter of Life and Death.
0596101996|5.0|The last time I bought this was the Second Edition.  Boy, a lot has changed since then!<br /><br />I've mostly avoided Javascript because of platform compatibility issues.  These aren't entirely gone now, but it certainly has gotten bette, and this book shows how to get around what remains.<br /><br />I liked the \\"no-fluff\\" writing.  David Flanagan covers everything concisely - some reviewers here have complained about lack of examples, but I felt that those given were sufficient.<br /><br />The basic structure is as it was before (language overview in part I, client side use in browsers in part II) but many subjects have been expanded and there are entire new chapters.<br /><br />Definitely definitive :-)
B00005JOSU|5.0|This movie was one of the best I have seen in a while. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves really hit it off together in this film. The dance scene was definately my favorite. <br />I do have one thing to say about the overly-logical people contemplating watching this movie... Don't watch it. You are only going to confuse yourself. <br />To enjoy this movie you have to be a hopeless romantic such as myself.  <br />With that being said, go enjoy one of the best movies of the year!
B000GIWS7E|4.0|I am a long time fan of DT and have purchased all the concert DVD's from Live in Tokyo to this one.  The band is as tight as ever and they play each song flawlessly but I found this particular concert lacking interest for some reason, especially compared to Budokan.  Compared to touring prog giants such as Pink Floyd (who just released a concert DVD) and Rush, Dream Theater seems to be lacking something in their show.  Maybe its a killer light show, or maybe their music is becoming a bit tedious with all the instrumental passages in the middle of the songs.  The orchestra seemed great at times but very off and uncomfortable at other times and their was a lack of energy most of the time.  I think if DT want to take themselves to the next level they need to add something to the interest of their live show...problem is I just can't seem to put my finger on what that is yet.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I liked about half the songs on Brave New Word and less than that on Dance of Death, so I only bought this one due to the great reviews it had been getting. I thought Maiden had lost it until I heard this epic album. I'm a fan of groups like Dream Theater and Symphony X, so the progressive elements are a welcome addition for me. Most of the songs are slower in pace than anything they have done before, but that's not to say they aren't heavy.<br /><br />The only songs I don't enjoy so much are \\"Out of the Shadows\\" and \\"Pilgrim\\". The other eight songs are very good with the highlights for me being \\"For The Greater Good of God\\" and \\"Legacy\\". The only downside would be that they repeat the chorus a little too much on some of the songs, but it isn't as bad as it was on the last two albums. Maiden is back with a vengeance folks.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|First off, I can't believe what the previous reviewer A. Stutheit said in their review, because I wholeheartedly disagree.  But everyone's entitled to their own opinion, so to each his/her own.  It'd be pretty lame if we all blindly said \\"it's new Maiden, so automatically we love it!\\" <br /> <br />I don't agree that Iron Maiden is making the same mistake thrice by writing longer, more epic songs on this album.  I feel that Iron Maiden is only continuing to get better at doing what they do best with epic songs.  I do agree that DOD was not their best effort out of the past 3 albums, but like Bruce Dickinson said in an interview for AMOLAD, Dance of Death in retrospect was more of a stepping stone to get to the sound that is this new album. <br /> <br />Ahhh, the sound of this new album!  Sounds very fresh to me--- very upfront and crisp.  Steve Harris mentioned that they did not \\"master\\" this album-- not sure what that does to the final product, but I'm assuming that it sort of polishes the edges on the mix a bit.  Kudos to Maiden for going against the grain and not doing this. <br /> <br />The production is very good.  I feel that Kevin Shirley is great at capturing Maiden and their sound.  True, someone like Andy Sneap may have been a better choice to get a more modern metal sound, and that may have turned out quite interestingly.  But I think back to Bob Rock's production of Our Lady Peace's \\"Gravity\\" album, and can't help but think he sucked all the \\"Our Lady Peace\\"-ness out of OLP!  I'd hate for Iron Maiden to get homogenized on this album to sound like any one of a number of other metal bands out there today.  I don't like alot of metal that's out there today, so it's no surprise that I don't want Maiden to sound like any of it.  I'd rather they keep their own sound. <br /> <br />Songs that are really growing on me fast are \\"The Longest Day\\", \\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\\" and \\"The Pilgrim\\".  And \\"Benjamin Breeg' is great to listen to-- get's the blood pumping.  If there was a weak link on the album, it's the opener \\"Different World\\".  It's not quite up to the caliber of \\"The Wicker Man\\", the opener from Brave New World.  More in the league of \\"Wildest Dreams\\" from DOD.  It's not bad, per se, it's just that the rest of the album is much stronger.  But that's sort of the point of putting the \\"odd man out\\" early, so that it gets you prepared for the rest of the album's stronger songs while still giving you a taste of the overall vibe of the album. <br /> <br />Another great album from Maiden all in all.  I easily like it as much as Brave New World, and like it alot more than Dance of Death.  There's a darkness to the lyrics that sounds very \\"X-Factor\\" meets \\"Tyranny of Souls\\".  It's not \\"classic Maiden\\" (i.e. in the vein of Powerslave, Somewhere In Time, Peace of Mind), but part of a newer, more mature (and equally powerful) era for Iron Maiden. <br /> <br />UP THE IRONS!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|If you are even remotely considering buying this DVD set, hesitate no further.  Supernatural ended basically a 30-year boycott of TV for me, during which time I saw just enough to decide that nothing out there was worth watching.     This one is different.  Never dreamed I would plan my schedule around a TV show...  If it hadn't been advertised on the internet, I would never have found it, as I didn't even know a WB channel existed.  But Yahoo's little tease was enticing (\\"Is this show too scary for television?\\"), and I actually sat there and watched the entire pilot on a 4\\" screen, and was hooked in the first 4 minutes.  So is my family--ages 11 to 53, as are my 70-ish parents.    The entire cast and crew is stellar, and the all-around quality is light-years better than anything I've ever seen.  Jared and Jensen have mastered their art with these characters, so much so that you forget they are acting.  Sam is the brainy, sensitive, perceptive, troubled guy, while Dean is cocky, sarcastic, impulsive, and has no respect for authority.  They are polar opposites in every respect, and sometimes butt heads at critical moments.  But there is a deep bond between them, a love that comes out in subtle ways, but simply can't be demonstrated overtly.  That just wouldn't be cool.  (\\"Hey.  No chick flick moments.\\")   The relationship of the brothers and complex family dynamic is the #1 reason I watch.    The classic rock music has become a signature of the show, really fits the characters and the setting, and has opened up for me a whole new world that I missed the first time around because I was too busy listening to schmooze.    But aside from the exceptional acting, fascinating characters, and cool music, the series has everything that makes a show excel: compelling storylines, unexpected humor at the most unlikely moments, conflict, suspense, gore, and three really hot guys (I include the dad, Jeffrey Dean Morgan), not to mention some \\"smokin'\\" (as Dean puts it) women gueststars, eye candy for all the men watching out there.  The viewer truly becomes emotionally engaged with the characters.  It's been refreshing to discover a series that is so carefully and skillfully crafted.  How they put it all together on the fast-paced timetable of series TV is beyond comprehension.    The season gets still better as it goes along.  The guest stars in the latter part of the season were just incredible.  This is a show for both genders, but being scary and sometimes bloody and gross, it's not for young kids.  It's rated TV14, though I'd consider that pretty conservative.    If I were forced to choose which episodes were the worst, I'd settle on Bugs (storyline was lame), Water (guest stars were marginal), and Route 666 (guest stars were horrible, story wasn't too hot either).  But even those three are worth watching.  There's always something to save the show.  In Bugs, it's a really critical conversation between Sam and Dean, and some great humor.  In Water, the story was good.  In Route 666, Sam's pesky little brother routine was great.    The best episodes for me were Pilot, Home, Asylum, Skin, Benders (Wow!), Nightmare (AWESOME), Hell House (hilarious!), Wicked, Provenance (really spooky), Salvation, and Trap.  I know, that's hardly narrowing it down, but hey, you just can't.  It's too good.  I didn't exactly like the vampires in Blood, but the writers did well with it, and Luther made the vamps worth watching...not to mention that one of my favorite scenes of the season was in that episode, an intense fight between Sam and his father showcasing some incredible acting by Jared.    My only complaint is the absolutely wretched cliffhanger at the end.  Did the writers honestly think they had to pull something like that to get us to come back next season??  Thank heaven for spoilers, or this summer would have killed me.    You will not be disappointed if you buy this DVD set.  You will likely watch each episode more than once, so you're talking many hours of entertainment for a reasonable cost.  The extras are so much fun--several cut scenes, a hilarious gag reel, and more fun commentaries and visits on the set.  It's cool to see what goes on behind the scenes, very neat to see the guys as they truly are, and fascinating to hear how all this came about.    AWESOME job, cast and crew!  You should be proud!  You're not killing yourself for nothing up there in Vancouver.    THANK YOU to the CW for picking this show up.  Here's to many more years of pure entertainment!
B00007L4OM|4.0|With \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" & \\"Ronin\\" in his past & both \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" & \\"The Pink Panther\\" out in 2006, Jean Reno's profile in the States is riding high.  His performance as the cop Hubert is a blockbuster.  Gerard Krawczyk who directed \\"Taxi 2,\\" \\"The Messenger: The Joan of Arc Story\\" & his recent \\"Fanfan la Tulipe\\" does a good job of keeping the pace brisk and the story like a whipped flambe, full of flavor but light.  Hubert's daughter Yumi is played by Ryoko Hirosue in the 3rd of her 4 films.  \\"Poppoya: Railroad Man\\" & \\"Himitsu aka Secret\\" are other credits of hers I have yet to taste.  She does an excellent job dressing like a Japanese Cyndi Lauper, while just wanting to have fun.  The bright oranges of her costumes are wild & wonderful.  Hubert's sidekick in Japan is Momo played by Michel Muller from \\"Like a Fish Out of Water\\" & \\"The Daltons.\\"  Muller does an excellent job of keeping the comedy light, being just dumb enough to make the jokes work and bright enough not to get shot.  The film works if you don't look at the plot too closely.  (At the end, why does Hubert have to leave when he's on a 2-month suspension that started 2 days ago?)  The Japanese actor who plays the Zebra does a great job.  It's fast paced and breezy, like a French version of an American movie.  This is an excellent evening's entertainment.  Enjoy!

0767830555|5.0|Everyone's favorite disturbed sentimental favorite cabbie drives on. Even after 30 years, Martin Scorsese's \\"Taxi Driver\\" still hits a familiar nerve with it's audience whether new or old. As Travis Bickell, Robert DeNiro plays one of his most well-known roles. His anguish and disgust for all things wrong are intensified with his job and living situation. As a cab driver in a city (NYC) that has it's fair of poverty, crime, and unsanitary conditions, Travis becomes an inevitable time-bomb ready to blow up.<br /><br />There is more to Travis though as he does recognize his surroundings and assumes a self role as an important person in the solution of what aches him. His target is a popular political<br />candidate. His journey though is side tracked by a lovely<br />distraction (Cybil Sheppard). At the same time Travis monitors the actions of a very young prostitute (Jody Foster) to \\"free\\" her of the madness around her. So, what we actually have is a<br />multi-tasking emotionally disturbed individual in a collision course with history.<br /><br />What many viewer see themselves in Travis is his disgust for<br />things in need of repair/disposal. His intentions and actions were extreme though, but his aim was arguably true. Another 30<br />years or so and Travis' story will still matter.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Even better than I remember it 4 years ago. Makes me again question what the American public is watching and what network tv is thinking. A must-have for any good tv watcher's collection!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|And their best CD. Granted its not as 'metal' as some of their earlier work, but I don't have any problem with that. Unless you are a traditionalist who insist music has to be rock, classical etc. you will be able to like this.
B000059XUI|5.0|the first superman movie was great this one is even better this movie has superman fighting not one but three superpowered villian each one with the same power he has.the other superman movies mainly part 3 and 4 were good to they were much much much better then the new superman movie (if you expect superman to fight villians with powers in the new superman movie you will be very very very very dissappointed)anyway this movie has good story good plot but the showdown with the supervillians is at the end of the movie buy this sequel to superman the first movie you will not be dissappointed at least in this sequel he fights superpowered villians.
B000H7JD4K|3.0|\\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\" has been one of 2006's highest anticipated and most talked about releases for quite a long time. And why not? This band is armed only with healthy, talented musicians (including a trio of guitarists, and a legendary singer named Bruce Dickinson). Plus, their 2003 release, \\"Dance Of Death,\\" was a commercial flop, so one would think there would have been some added incentive for Maiden to take the world by storm and stage an amazing comeback. But did they? Nope, sorry. They did mount a return by releasing a new full-length, but it's easy to ignore this album because it doesn't amount to anything more than an incredibly disappointing and over-hyped misfire.<br /><br />Perhaps the first thing you'll notice about the album is that it isn't embarrassed to show off Iron Maiden's current obsession with being \\"progressive\\" and \\"epic.\\" Thus, if you made the early assumption that \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\" struggles with overly long songs, you were actually spot on. (It's ten tracks and over seventy-two minutes long, for crying out loud!) These gratuitous lengths are mainly due to needing pointlessly slow, plodding intros and/or outros. Seven out of these ten tracks begin the same way: with a melodic instrument of some kind, like a softly strummed guitar. There's nothing inherently wrong with tacking on an intro or outro to a song, but it's insufferable when both ends of almost every song are virtually identical because it can be very confusing to discern where one song ends and another begins.<br /><br />Maiden first started dabbling in this more progressive sound back on 2000's \\"Brave New World.\\" Making that mistake once is forgivable. But doing it a second time (on 2003's \\"Dance Of Death\\") is kind of strange, and making that same mistake three times in a row is positively inexplicable. Six years after their initial misstep, nothing has changed, and actually things have gotten worse. In this case, the band is using the same idea again and again, but it never sounds any different than the last time you heard it, so to keep on using out eventually comes across as stale, unimaginative, forced, and...well...stupid!<br /><br />But even if someone had trimmed a ton of fat off every one of these songs (shortened the running time by at least three minutes), several nagging problems would still remain. Even with three full-time guitarists on board (Dave Murray, Janick Gers, and Adrian Smith), Iron Maiden's music frequently sounds devoid of energy, intensity, urgency, and personality. This is especially troubling when you consider that some bands are capable of stirring up some a substanital amount of palpable, frothing energy with only one guitar player. But instead, whatever intensity this record has is, at best, heavily watered-down and uninspired.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Different World,\\" \\"These Colours Don't Run,\\" \\"The Longest Day,\\" \\"The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg,\\" and \\"Lord Of Light\\" pack some initial bite, but their potential is lost when the mid-sections are usually weighed down by boring, overly drawn-out instrumental passages. And the rest of the song is an anti-climactic outro (which is even more frusterating when the song starts to end right after it hit full-stride and finally began to work up some momentum).<br /><br />\\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\" does have an occasional bright spot, like the complex, multi-faceted \\"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns,\\" the laid back, mid-tempo jam \\"Out of the Shadows\\" (which also has several melodic guitar solos), and the excellent, vintage Maiden-sounding \\"For The Greater Good Of God.\\"<br /><br />On the whole, though, the album doesn't work out well. It's not yet completely out of the realm of possibility that I.M. will miraculously one day get their heads together and go back to being the energetic, tight, focused band that they have been in the past. But if that's ever going to happen, it's not going to be anytime soon, because albums like this one only further thedistance between the two sounds. And even if they do somehow improve on future releases, there's no changing that \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\" is far too repetitive, incomplete, vapid, directionless, and bland to be a success.hey do somehow improve on future releases, there's no changing that \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\" is far too repetitive, incomplete, vapid, directionless, and bland to be a success.

B0009R1T7M|1.0|Some clever stuff...but as far as music goes, I just can't bring myself to enjoy it (with the possible exception of Night Zombies).  It escapes me why this has shown up on so many best of 2005 lists.
0553212443|5.0|this is not the best of Charles Dickens but it is one of his triumphs and his shortest book. <br />it is about a grumpy man named Scrooge who hates christmas and calls it humbug and one noight he meets the ghost of his old friend Marly folowed b three mysterious ghost the first of christmas past and takes him to when he was younger, then the ghost of christmas present showing him what is hapening right then, then the ghost of Christmas In the Future and shows what will happen and how he will be buried and when he wakes up he has a change of mind and makes his poor employee Bob Cratchet and as punishment for being late he gives him a raise. this is highly recomended to people from 10-50 even though i read it when i was 6 but i do not think that other 6 year ols would eenjoy it as much. <br />            Caleb A.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|A great movie that holds up to multiple viewings.  The flavor is slightly different than the series, but it is an excellent complement to the world of Firefly.  C'mon Universal...make another Firefly/Serenity movie!  <br /> <br />I highly recommend you see the Firefly series (DVD set) prior to this movie.  Be prepared to be sad that it doesn't last long enough.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Good, solid album by Coldplay.  Speed of Sound and X & Y are my top two songs on the album.  I wish they made more songs like X & Y.  Its a nice blend of slow and semi-fast music.  It seems like I always find 3-4 songs I really like in each album, it takes a bit to get used to too, BUT if you give Coldplay a chance, you'll never turn back...............
B000FSME1A|5.0|I have to agree with the other reviews that mentioned a M.I.A \\"Hearts of Darkness\\". If you already own the original A.N. and Redux, then there is not much more to see.

B000DZIGDU|4.0|Jarhead is not your typical war movie.  It isn't about some soldier ascending to the plateau of hero or some impossible mission miraculously being achieved or even a slanted commentary on the dehumanization of the soldier experience.  Instinctively, the viewer of a war movie looks for something big in the end - be it a major battle or some philosophical point about war in general.  Jarhead doesn't deliver either of these two things - and that it both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness.<br /><br />Jarhead is a personal war story, a truth-based depiction of military life and the Iraqi War as one Marine lived it.  We meet Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) in boot camp, as he first begins to question his decision to join up.  Swoff is anything but a model soldier, yet somehow he manages to get recruited into an elite Marine Sniper unit commanded by Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx).  His training is ruthless and difficult, yet his sharp-shooting ability gets him through it, despite a few major incidents along the way.  With Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, Swoff and his fellow Marines start to get ready for the real battlefield experience some of them seem to crave.  Rather than hitting the beaches running, though, the men are forced to endure month after month in the middle of very hot, very sandy nowhere.  Running around the desert in full chemical weapons suits is brutal, but nothing is more agonizing to these Marines than the interminable wait for something to happen.  Military discipline or no, it's no great shock when Swoff goes a little stir crazy out there - what is shocking, however, is that he wasn't drummed out of the Corps for what he did.  Anyway, the war finally begins, but it's nothing like what Swoff and his fellow snipers expected.  The war moves too quickly for them, leaving the men walking through wastelands littered with death and destruction and enduring the torture of a constant oily rain from all the oil wells Saddam had torched, as all the while they desperately yearn for the chance to actually engage the enemy and do what they were trained to do.<br /><br />We really only get to know three of the soldiers - Swoff, who just wants out; Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), who just wants to remain a soldier, and Sykes, a career soldier who believes in and loves serving his country - but we get a number of viewpoints into Marine life from other prominent soldiers.  I daresay the emotional climax of the film is unique among the genre of war films; it's the exact opposite of what I expected and is actually quite jarring to sit there and watch.  Its significance is reinforced by the film's ending, but I don't think the conclusion really works all that well.  It's just sort of thrown out there at the end, and I don't think the movie gives us enough to truly put what happens in any real context.  It's the kind of ending, though, that makes you ask yourself what the real point of this movie was.  I've come to the conclusion that there really isn't a definitive point propelling itself through the script.  Managing to tow a rather objective line from start to finish, Jarhead gives you plenty to think about - but it leaves you to take what you will from the viewing experience.<br /><br />There are rarely any simple truths to be found in war, and there's more to being a hero than killing more than your share of enemies.  Don't go into Jarhead expecting an hour's worth of fierce combat or looking to have your pro- or anti-war beliefs strengthened or challenged.  Some people will not like this movie, but I think it's an important film that succeeds pretty darned well in putting the viewer inside the mind of a real soldier.e they desperately yearn for the chance to actually engage the enemy and do what they were trained to do.  <br /> <br />We really only get to know three of the soldiers - Swoff, who just wants out; Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), who just wants to remain a soldier, and Sykes, a career soldier who believes in and loves serving his country - but we get a number of viewpoints into Marine life from other prominent soldiers.

0790729628|2.0|Blade Runner didn't do much justice for me. There's something missing or wrong with the theatrical and the 1991 DC versions. I will give this movie another chance when it comes out next year. I hope Mr. Scott will give its proper cut.
B000G759LW|4.0|I bought Christina Aguilera's latest CD, \\"Back to Basics\\" as an early birthday present for myself. I have her self-titled CD and \\"Stripped\\" and while there are songs on both those albums that I love, there are also a few I skip over. Same with \\"Back to Basics.\\" Here's my low-down of the tracks. <br /> <br />First album: <br /> <br />1. INTRO (BACK TO BASICS) - Christina introduces the album (obviously) and how she's paying tribute to those artists from \\"back in the day.\\" Not as catchy as the \\"Stripped\\" introduction. <br /> <br />2. MAKES ME WANNA PRAY - Not only is this song my favorite on the first disc, but it's my favorite song overall on the album. A very high-energy beat that reminds you of something that might be sung in a church (not any I've ever been to, though!) Trust me, you only need to hear this song once and you'll want to listen to it again and again. <br /> <br />3. BACK IN THE DAY - There are shout outs to artists peppered throughout this song (such as the likes of Aretha Franklin, Louis Armstrong, and Stevie Wonder). Like in the intro, she's paying tribute to those artists from \\"back in the day.\\" \\"Such classics songs, don't forget them,\\" is what she says about \\"What's Going On\\" and \\"Respect.\\" Word, girlfriend, word. <br /> <br />4. AIN'T NO OTHER MAN - It's no big surprise this was the first single of the album. It's catchy and easy to catch on to the lyrics, that you'll soon be singing along with Christina. <br /> <br />5. UNDERSTAND - This is my second favorite song from the album. There's an element of nostalgia in this song, perhaps due to the fact that there's a sample from the song \\"Nearer to You\\" sung by Betty Harris looped in, so it gives it that old school vibe.  <br /> <br />6. SLOW DOWN BABY - This song sort of reminds me of \\"Fighter,\\" but not quite. It's catchy, but not as catchy as \\"Fighter\\" (one of my favorite Christina songs), but Christina has sort of that loud, \\"I mean it\\" voice thing going on. <br /> <br />7.  OH MOTHER - I've never seen Christina Aguilera's \\"Driven\\" or \\"Behind the Music,\\" so I don't know much about her personal life, but this song is about her mother who was abused by her father. It's sung in the same vein as \\"I'm OK.\\" <br /> <br />8. F.U.S.S. - This is an acronym for F*** U Scott Scorch, who produced the songs from \\"Stripped\\" whose titles she says in this song. Apparently they got in some big tiff (no idea what happened, don't really care), and this was her, well, middle finger to him. I think it was a bit childish of her to put this song on the album, she should have left this between her and Scorch and it's pretty much a waste of album space.  <br /> <br />9. ON OUR WAY - This is one of the songs on the album I'm ambivalent towards. I don't love it, but I don't hate it. To me, it's kind of forgetful. <br /> <br />10. WITHOUT YOU - A nice, soft ballad I would compare to \\"I Turn to You.\\" <br /> <br />11. STILL DIRRTY - While the beat is fun and funky, (the song sounds nothing like \\"Dirrty,\\" so don't expect a part 2 of that one), the lyrics make me roll my eyes as Christina reassures us with lyrics like \\"I still got the nasty in me, still got that dirty degree,\\" that while you can take the skank out of the girl, you can't take the girl out of the skank. Hmm, that didn't make much sense, did it? I guess she's gotta make sure those old perverts are still buying her album! That said, I have to say this song is very catchy. <br /> <br />12. HERE TO STAY - I love the music throughout this song, it sounds like it could be a theme song to a `70s TV show. The lyrics are a bit egotistical as they are about Christina stating that she's \\"here to stay.\\" But hey, she does the talent, so she can get away with it. If this were Britney Spears, or, God forbid, Paris Hilton, singing this, my eyes would be stuck in the back of their sockets.   <br /> <br />13. THANK YOU (DEDICATION TO FANS) - Hate this song, easily the worst on the album. We first hear a remixed clip of \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" and at first I thought the song was going to have samples from all of her hits, which would have been pretty cool. But instead it's a bunch of random fans thanking HER and how great and amazing she is and how she saved their lifes and blah, blah, blah. It just comes off as really self-centered, plus the music is really annoying. <br /> <br />Second album: <br /> <br />1.  ENTER THE CIRCUS - Introduction to the second album, has a \\"Moulin Rouge\\"-esque feel. <br /> <br />2. WELCOME - I really love the music and Christina's vocals on this one. <br /> <br />3. CANDYMAN - This is a lot of people's favorite song from the album and it's easy to see why. With fun (albeit a little racy!) lyrics and a boogie-woogie type music, you'll probably have this song on repeat. <br /> <br />4. NASTY NAUGHTY BOY - A bluesy, sensual song with sexually explicit lyrics she sings with g-rated words. It's very reminiscent of something Jessica Rabbit would sing. <br /> <br />5. I GOT TROUBLE - Throughout the song there's a crackling kind of sound like you would hear on a record that gives it that old authentic feel and Christina's voice is kind of muffled (but she's still audible). It's a very old-fashioned type song and I love it! <br /> <br />6. HURT - Don't laugh, but when I first saw this title on the back of the CD, I thought maybe she had done a cover of the Johnny Cash song. No, it's not, but that would be something, huh? Christina covering Johnny Cash? This \\"Hurt\\" is a lovely, poignant ballad about losing someone and I do believe it's her next single. <br /> <br />7. MERCY ON ME - The more I listen to this song, the more I love it. Right now it's tied with \\"Candyman\\" as my favorite song on the second disc. It's a church-y sounding song with a choir singing at the beginning and an organ being played. Christina sings about asking for forgiveness for her sins. <br /> <br />8. SAVE ME FROM MYSELF - Christina sings in a softer voice than we're usually accustomed to hear her singing. I find this song a bit boring, not one of my favorites.  <br /> <br />9. THE RIGHT MAN - Song about Christina's husband, Jordan Bratmat and the day of her marriage to him. Great vocals, sweet song. Somehow I don't think we'll see Britney singing a song half as good as this one to K-Fed anytime soon!
B00028HBKM|5.0|When I first heard about this film in production, I assumed that it was going to be yet another Hollywood-type product, following the cliched Hollywood style. In fact, the only reason I went to see it was because the dialogue would be in Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin. I wanted to hear what Jesus' words sounded like in Aramaic.  <br /> <br />Was I surprised! From the very start, this film was different. I'm a Christian, so I have a bias toward the subject. However, I wasn't expecting the high level of artistry in its treatment, in its filming, lighting, storytelling, and imagery. It felt like a foreign film--that is, sophisticated and daring. This is NOT sword-and-sandal spectacle. <br /> <br />From the heavy atmosphere of the Garden of Gethsemane, with its thick mist in blue moonlight, to the Mediterranean light of stone courtyards, and eerie overcast sky above Golgotha, Gibson creates an ancient Jerusalem that seems to surround the viewer. I felt a chill in the garden, almost as if I were there, wrapped in the mist. From here forward, one is pulled along, between moments of frank, intense dialogue to moments of grand mal-dreamlike violence (the arrest of Jesus in the garden) or softness (Jesus' affectionate banter with his mother). The movie throws one off balance, shattering expectations, leaving the viewer disoriented. It was a story I knew well, but Gibson somehow made it new and surprising.  <br /> <br />There is terrible violence in this film, and there are reasons why people may object to it--especially the scene of Jesus' scourging at the hands of Pilate's soldiers. Usually films leave this sort of thing to the imagination. However, I understand Gibson's decision to dwell so graphically on this stage of the Passion. You can dismiss suffering you don't see. But when it's pushed into your face, you have to face it. I had not realized what \\"scourging\\" meant until I saw this scene, and it gave me a painful shock of realization that I and my sin were responsible. Judging from the sound of soft sobbing from other parts of the theater, others had the same flash of realization. <br /> <br />This film could have been mawkish, trite, tepid, politically correct. It could have ridden on the strength of popular ideology, and not bothered with edgy camerawork, editing, lighting, setting, casting, imagery. It could have been content to preach, and not worried about beauty. It could have stuck to the letter of the Scriptures, and avoided poetry and imagination. But the \\"Passion\\" is Outsider Art on a grand scale. It's touching because it's sincere--the expression of an artist speaking from the depth of his heart to touch the audience in the depths of theirs.
B000000WZ4|5.0|Ultra was for Depeche mode a new begining, coming out of some personal troubles, Gahan attempting suicide, Wilder leaving.<br /><br />maybe the people related closer to this album than others because the lyrics seems more personal and darker. But their was definatley an undercurrent message of hope in this album. It's one of those albums I will defend because it is so personal, coming thru the dark spots in life and still having that anger but beating surviving it. I appreciated this album for the lyrics and music, but also because DM survived their demons.<br /><br />Cheers.
B00001OH7O|5.0|amazing. rick wakemen from yes plays piano in this and plays better than I have ever heard him play in anything else that he did apart from yes. intenese and unique. listen to this. a genuine record. harmonies and instruments fit together perfect the sort of intensity that only Bowie could pull off. best songs are life on mars, andy warhol, and the bewley brothers, and oh you pretty boy. i enjoy the lyrics. anyone have anything to reccomend to me?
B00004T0US|4.0|This edition of \\"Moody Blue\\" includes Elvis last two albums \\"From Elvis Presley Boulevard\\" (tracks 10 through 19) and \\"Moody Blue\\" (or at least most of it - a live version of \\"Let Me Be There\\" was included on the original release of \\"Moody Blue\\" but is left off this edition).  Most of these songs were recorded at Elvis' Graceland studio.  Elvis was in poor health during these sessions and also apparently suffered from depression which affected his motivation.  Because of this, Elvis' producer, Felton Jarvis, did not have enough studio recordings for the \\"Moody Blue\\" album and ended up using some live recordings to complete the album.  Despite these problems, this collection includes several strong performances.  \\"Hurt\\" shows that Elvis was still able to belt out a great song even in the last year of his life.  The song was a Top 40 hit in the US pop chart and Top 10 on the country chart.  \\"For The Heart\\" was a minor country hit, but probably would have been a bigger hit had it not been released as the B-side of \\"Hurt\\".  I really like Elvis' version of \\"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\\".  It is much different than Willie Nelson's hit version; Elvis does it in an R&B style and it really works!<br /><br />The song \\"Moody Blue\\" was also a Top 40 hit but went all the way to number 1 on the Country charts and number 2 on the Adult Contemporary chart, before Elvis death.  \\"Way Down\\" was released and moving up the charts just before his death.  After his death it quickly moved into the top 20 on the Pop chart and was another number 1 Country hit.  \\"Pledging My Love\\" is also excellent.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, this is a very good collection and a must for Elvis fans.
B00000373U|5.0|I didn't understand this album at first. I didn't understand why everyone liked Elliot Smith, and this was my first introduction and this is the best Elliot Smith album. I am so glad I kept it on my computer because about 6 months later I heard it again and listened to it again and again. Not pretentious like I had thought but real. and smooth. Alamada, pictures of me, ballad of a big nothing, and speed trials are the best songs. Elliot Definitely inspired by Beatles and Beach Boys. Elliot seems like someone who fits in perfectly yet doesn't. Elliot keeps it honest but not in a \\"look I am being honest way.\\" I don't want to make it all about Elliot, as I don't like to make music neccesarilly completely about the person or bring it up so much like some critic but this album really does make you feel in touch with him,. maybe it is a sydrome of all people that died young or killed themselves as I feel the soul of Cobain, Joplin, and so forth.....but I feel like I stabbing myself in the chest when listening to this music. it's all relative. anyway this review sucks and I don't care if you agree.
B00004T0UT|5.0|After years of recording mediocre soundtracks, this was Elvis' long-overdue return to making real music.  And what a return it was!  In a rare smart move, Elvis' management loosened their reigns on him setting him up to work with Chip Moman at Memphis' American Sound Studios to produce this album.  The new environment and material seemed to refresh Elvis' creative spirit and he delivered some of the best performances of his career!  The majority of the album has a strong R&B flavor, with some country thrown in for good measure.  The original album was made up of the first 12 songs which included only one hit \\"In The Ghetto\\".  This release has 6 bonus tracks that were recorded during the sessions for the album, including the hits \\"Suspicious Minds\\", \\"Don't Cry Daddy\\", and \\"Kentucky Rain\\".  If these songs had been included on the original release, it probably would have went all the way to number 1!<br /><br />Inexplicably, after the success of these recordings Elvis would never work with Chip Moman again nor be given this amount of creative freedom and quality material.
B000CNDIZE|5.0|Like many, I became acquainted with Sia's music before I knew who she was, while she sang with Zero 7. Learned to love her voice, but honestly I had no idea she was back until I picked up the second part of the OST for \\"Six Feet Under\\" and heard her singing \\"Breathe Me\\" (which happens to play to the last scene in the last episode of the last season). I was blown away by her.<br /><br />In \\"Colour the Small One\\" she fixes a place for herself, somewhere between Nelly Furtado and Dido, with a softness more typical of the lounge space that she came from (with Zero 7), resulting in a very interesting album that makes her an artist to keep an eye on in the future.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Stunning music.  Not a note out of place.  Perfect in every way:  engaging lyrics, gorgeous vocals, rolling rhythmic backups by stellar musicians,  haunting melodies.  I can't imagine this not being nominated for best album.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I think this is a great CD; I'm listening to it as I write this! I think expectations, going into it, play a key role in how much you'll like it -- I had an open mind. Gilmour has matured, and so have I. I wouldn't say it's \\"easy listening\\" at all! I'm amazed that David still plays a mean guitar, and still has a soothing voice. The more I play it, the more I like it!
B00003CXCW|5.0|I watched \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" (1950) for the first time a few days ago, after a friend lent it to me. I am very grateful to him because otherwise I probably wouldn't have rented it, or at least not anytime soon. And truth to be told, this is the kind of movie that you simply should watch as soon as possible. From my point of view, \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" is, like \\"Casablanca\\" and \\"The Maltese falcon\\", a classic.<br /><br />This film is directed by Billy Wilder, and narrated by a dead man that appears in one of the first scenes floating in a swimming pool. It sounds strange, doesn't it? Despite that, it is very effective! The opening sequence is strong, but things get better and better as the story goes on. Despite that, a word of caution is in order: if you don't like black humour, don't watch \\"Sunset Boulevard\\", because this satire of the perverse side of Hollywood has it in spades.<br /><br />One of the main characters is Joe Gillis (William Holden), a screenwriter without money that happens to hide from his creditors in an old mansion that seems to be empty. That is unfortunately not the case... The mansion is no less than the home of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a rich woman that used to be a silent screen star, and that wants to be famous again. That appears to be the reason why she employs Joe to improve a very long script she has written for her comeback, and also the reason why she insists that Joe is to stay at her house in the meantime. Joe isn't fond of the idea of staying in the mansion with the old woman and her creepy butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim), but he has no money, so he has to accept. Joe Gillis is like a fly caught in a spider's web: from the moment he enters Norma's house he is doomed, he just doesn't know it yet.<br /><br />What will happen? Well, you must watch this film to learn that. I can only promise you that \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" is the kind of movie you don't regret watching. It is entertaining, insightful, has great performances and includes some of the best lines I have heard in a movie. Again, a classic. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS: If possible, remember to watch the extra features after seeing this film. One of them, a commentary by Ed Sikov, is specially good, due to the fact that it allows you to learn several interesting facts about the cast and the making of this movie.<br /><br />PS 2: I wil include here some of my favourite quotes from this movie. I'm sure they will make you want to watch it :)<br /><br />-Joe Gillis: \\"You're Norma Desmond. You used to be in silent pictures. You used to be big\\".<br /> Norma Desmond: \\"I am big.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|Certainly the best kung-fu movie I've ever seen, Kung Fu Hustle is loaded with effects and humor, and stunning fight sequences to boot.  Try and watch any regular martial arts movie afterward and all you can do is yawn, even the great Bruce Lee is tired and played-out in comparison to Kung Fu Hustle.  The movie continues to top itself throughout, with an escalation of fight scenes that peaks with the hero jumping higher than the clouds, seeing Buddha, lightly stepping off a bird, and plunging to earth to deliver a blow capable of knocking a fifty-foot hole in a building!  This aint just wire-fu, it's wired-fu with hilarious weirdness.
B0009A40ES|4.0|In this film version of Brett Easton Ellis' often misunderstood satiric novel, the question of Bateman's real versus imaginary deeds is answered more firmly than Ellis allowed to happen in the book. Here, seemingly, at least some if not all of Patrick Bateman's violence apparently came to pass only in the space between the sick (though impeccably fashionable) Yuppie's ears. In this flashy, stylish and yet somehow still laudably low-key adaptation of a novel once thought unfilmable, Christian Bale does  a superb job of embodying a self-loving, celebrity-obsessed, brand name worshipping billionaire playboy, who tells us in lingering detail how he just happens to slay random people in his spare time. Bale trades his native Welsh accent for a polished snooty high society American one, and his comedic narcissism is refreshing in comparison with how so many other actors would have played this daunting role. The extended \\"cut\\" of American Psycho restores some of the nudity and a little of the violence left out in the theatrical release six years ago. What has never been removed is the dark humor and blistering satire that skewers the late 1980's love of excess. Fine performances abound in American Psycho, from the always magnificent Willem Dafoe, to Reese Witherspoon as Patrick's bubble-brained fianc&eacute;e, to a downtrodden Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's loyal secretary, to Samantha Mathis as a pill popping \\"hotbod\\" whose dead-end drug addiction amuses the sadistic Bateman. Filmmaker Mary Harron, who also gave us the bleak nineties art-flick, I Shot Andy Warhol, packs a lot into the relatively short run time of this movie, and in my opinion, she did a pretty fine job with some difficult material.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|THE BAND: Brad Delp (all lead & harmony vocals), Tom Scholz (lead & rhythm guitars, organ, clavinet, bass guitar), Barry Goudreau (guitars), Fran Sheehan (bass guitar), Sib Hashian (drums), Jim Masdea (drums on \\"Rock & Roll Band\\" only).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1976) 8 tracks clocking in at approximately 38 minutes. Included with the disc is a 10-page booklet containing song titles/credits, band photos, an 8-page (historical) intro to the band, and thank you's. Recorded at Foxglove Studios (Watertown, MA), Capitol Studios (Hollywood, CA) and The Record Plant (Los Angeles, CA). All songs written by Scholz, except \\"Smokin'\\" and \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\" by Scholz and Delp. Album cover art by Roger Huyssen. Originally released on Epic's label, this digitally remastered edition released in 2006 on Sony/BMG/Epic.<br /><br />COMMENTS: This is Boston's 30th anniversary edition of their classic '76 debut. Getting the digitally remastered sound it so justly deserves. It's about time. I knew this was M.I.T. educated Tom Scholz's brainchild... I just didn't know how much of it though. The 8 pages of insight included with the disc was a real eye-opener. Scholz, while working at Polaroid, knocked on music industry doors with tapes in hand... for years, trying to get discovered... only to hear \\"not interested\\". Per Scholz, \\"Boston's perceived 'instant' stardom obscured six years of abject failure...\\" Originally, these songs were all recorded by Scholz playing all the instruments in his basement. Delp came into sing. For the most part, this was a two man show as far as the recording went. Other musicians playing their respective instruments were added later. There were no band practices in a garage, and no touring in small Rhode Island bars (like one of their songs might make you think). I always thought Boston had one drummer (Sib)... but Jim Masdea was the original drummer - and Scholz left his playing on one track (\\"Rock & Roll Band\\") as well as being a contributor behind the scenes assisting Scholz and Delp with arrangements. 6 of the 8 songs here feature Scholz playing ALL the instruments except drums - \\"Something About You\\", \\"Hitch A Ride\\", \\"Smokin'\\", \\"Rock & Roll Band\\", \\"Peace Of Mind\\" and \\"More Than A Feeling\\". This album is the single most commercially successful debut album from ANY band/group, period (17+ million units sold). Out of all albums released in the 70's, only Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", Led Zeppelin's \\"IV/Zoso\\", and Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\" sold more albums. That also includes out-distancing classic debuts from other rock legends like Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Aerosmith, the Doors, Pearl Jam and Guns & Roses. Side 1 of this album was incredible... \\"More Than A Feeling\\", \\"Peace Of Mind\\", and \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\" (with some incredible guitar work from Goudreau)... all sixteen-and-a-half minutes of it. Side 2 was short as well at just over 21 minutes... but put together - this album had an incredible punch.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|Okay, so I tried to come up with a title that would be appropriate for a review of this CD. My first thought was, \\"Bob Dylan Swims In Muddy Waters.\\" Then I thought maybe, \\"Bob Dylan - A Folksinger In Howlin' Wolf's Clothing.\\" Finally I settled on, \\"Bob Dylan Gets His Wang Dang Doodle In Modern Times.\\" That says it all to me. It'll make sense to you, too, once you hear this great recording!
0743454537|5.0|I am amazed by those reviews that are less than glowing of 'My Sister's Keeper' and can be comforted only in knowing that these people must simply prefer a different type of book. This was a wonderful, riveting and thoughtful book written extremely well from numerous perspectives. I appreciate the fact that it was an \\"easy read,\\" particularly given its heavy topic. I retroactively read some of Jodi's previous books after falling in love with this one. They were okay, but it is obvious how she has grown in her writing...she gets an A+ from me for this one.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|This movie is kind of like a fart that won't come all the way out. You're left feeling like something more should have been accomplished. It's actually fun to watch (mostly) but they explain nothing, so it isn't worth the price of a purchase. <br />This is a Supernatural Revenge film. I thought it would turn out to be more Mad Scientist (Monsanto labs, maybe). I was wrong.  <br />The beginning of the movie was rushed, so that everybody could get to Silent Hill. Should have been more focus on Sharon's dreams and pictures. Still, it did it's job. <br />Stupid characters that have no point or are never explained: Exploding Acid Creature. Guy With Triangle Metal Head. Bugs. All the deformed creatures. <br />Actually, the only characters (other than the main ones) who make any sense at all are the religious cult members. Thinking they were survivors of the Apocolypse, they live in Silent Hill. <br />Well, after 30 years, why haven't any of them gone beyond the walls? Not one goes exploring? Hunting? Looking for food? One is shown scavenging, but there must be another food source. Cans on the hotel floor don't just appear Deus ex Machina after three decades. <br />And since they mention that a boy is found in a mine shaft, and a cop finds him, there must be some contact from the outside. This is West Virginia coal-mining. I'm telling you, bored teenagers would have been all over that place. There would have been EPA involvement, something. <br />The end was a big disappointment. Why aren't they home? Mission was accomplished, so what happened? Why are they in a miserable alternate dimension? <br />Annoying.  <br /> <br />
B000FIMG68|5.0|The first disc features an audio commentary on \\"Man of Science, Man of Faith\\" by executive producers Damon Lindelof, Carlton Cuse, Bryan Burk and Jack Bender (who also directed the episode). They talk about the story decisions they had to make: dedicating this episode to the hatch and the next one to what happened on the raft instead of trying to juggle both in the same episode.<br /><br />The third disc features a commentary on \\"What Kate Did\\" by director Paul Edwards, director of photography Michael Bonvillain and actress Evangeline Lilly. She keeps the track lighthearted as she jokes with Edwards. They offer mostly trivial factoids (like how she learned to ride a motorcycle for this episode) and talk about how this episode ran too long and had to be cut down.<br /><br />Also included is a commentary on \\"The 23rd Psalm\\" by Lindelof, Cuse and Burk. They wanted to introduce a character with a radically different past than the other characters.

An amusing extra. <br /> <br />There is a \\"Channel 4 UK Promo\\" directed by acclaimed music video director David LaChapelle that is very arty as the cast slow dance dreamily amongst the plane wreckage on the beach. <br /> <br />\\"Lost Connections\\" shows how the various characters are connected to each other either tangentially or directly with brief clips from the show illustrating these links. <br /> <br />\\"Mysteries, Theories and Conspiracies\\" has cast, crew and the fans offer their own personal theories as to what the show is all about and what is going on. J.J. Abrams and Lindelof are typically coy and cryptic. Various websites and a radio show that are dedicated to discussing the mythos of the show are profiled. <br /> <br />Finally, \\"Secrets from the Hatch\\" examines the genesis of the whole hatch subplot, when they were going to reveal it and how the actual set was conceptualized and assembled (the creators originally envisioned it akin to Walt Disney's Tomorrowland).
B000244FDW|3.0|I adore Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice because anybody at any given time can identify with the plot, the characters and its struggles. Having seen other adaptations, I just had to check this out.    CONS:   1. this version tries too hard to stay true to the book (which could be a plus) but the stagey daytime soap-opera look and feel is not engaging  2. the theatrical acting and pacing fails to make the characters alive and endearing (e.g. Jane Bennet, though agreeably the most beautiful Bennet, makes you wonder if she's a bit retarded instead of being kind at heart; Bingley appears flaky; Darcy's condescending manner is ridiculous and Elizabeth has limited range of emotions)    PROS: every now and then, the script delivers some hilarity; the costumes are beautiful    Tolerable at best.....
B000GRU6XS|5.0|As with any other Maiden album this one melts your face.  It sets phasers to ROCK and fires them with no regard.  Memorable solos, magnificant drumming (Nikco really out did himself on this one), Steve's galloping bass (is there a better bass player anywhere? NO!), and the triple guitars really make for a powerful sound. And you even get a \\"sweat on your brow\\" thrown in one of the songs, I mean what classic Maiden album dosn't have this lyric in it somewhere! :p<br /><br />  There seems to be a strong X-Factor (a great album) sound to many of the songs but substitue Blaze with Bruce and a much cleaner and powerful sound.<br /><br />  Everything is masterfully done.  I hear reviewers saying \\"Bruce still has it\\".  WTF have you been the past 2 Maiden albums and 3 solo Dickinson albums?  Of course Bruce still has it, he never lost it.<br /><br />  Every song is strong with no filler songs at all.  \\"For the Greater Good of God\\" is prolly the most epic and the chorus will be jamming in your head for years to come.  \\"Out of the Shadows\\" is reminicant of Bruce's solo masterpiece \\"Tears of the Dragon\\" and is equally a great song to any other on this album.<br /><br />  Some reviewers are trying to compare \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" to old Maiden albums which I can't seem to do.  Every Maiden album holds a special warm place in my heart (well except \\"No Prayer for the Dyeing\\" and \\"Virtual Eleven\\").  This album stands among the best.<br /><br />  Even with the new Blind Guardian album coming out the same week \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" is no doubt the metal album of the year, hell decade, hell century.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album I gurantee you will be pleased.  I can't seem to find any down side to this album.<br /><br />UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!!!
B000GFLAI0|4.0|Starting with \\"Time Out of Mind\\", more so on \\"Love and Theft\\", and finally on \\"Modern Times\\", Bob Dylan's voice has become a thing of wonder.  The lyrics, as always, are great.  But who can match him in phrasing, in delivery, in pure mystery?  \\"Ain't Talkin'\\" is the sound of some oracle from another world, delivering a cryptic message:    They say prayer has the power to heal   So pray from the mother   In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell   I am a-tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others   But oh, mother, things ain't going well.......    All my loyal and my much-loved companions   They approve of me and share my code   I practice a faith that's been long abandoned   Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road     Ain't talkin', just walkin'   My mule is sick, my horse is blind.   Heart burnin', still yearnin'   Thinkin' 'bout that gal I left behind.     What does that mean?  Does it mean anything?  Does Dylan just like the way the words sound together?  Is he just screwing with us?  (I've long suspected him of that).  Whatever..........I could care less.  Those who carp about his voice truly don't get it.      As with most Dylan albums, a couple of the songs don't quite get off the ground.  But again, like most Dylan albums, there are 1/2 dozen good songs, and one or two that bring the goosebumps.  \\"Ain't Talkin'\\" is one of those.  Again, like the last two albums, he's backed by a razor sharp band.  It's a must have, an easy 4-1/2 in today's substance-starved landscape.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This CD grew on me over the summer, and now it's one of my favorites.  All the way through, each song is a gem.  Enjoy!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is offically my Boyfriend!!! The CD is great from start to finish. My favorite, St. Patrick's Day, is so simple and beautiful. His sense of humor shows though in almost every song. The lyrics are sweet and just make me smile:) I've had it for a couple years and it hasn't gotten old yet!
B000FGFSPG|5.0|Best dvd , best voice , best of the best of all the times!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Knew nothing about the TV series. Rented 'Serenity' on a lark and immediately got hooked on the characters and their back stories. Went back to rent the 'Firefly' DVD's. After watching just the first 2 discs, went online and purchased both the movie and TV series DVD's. Like what many of the previous reviewers have said, this is science fiction at its best. Any serious sci fi fan should do him/herself a favor and invest time in catching up with this show. It captures the essence and spirit of the original Star Wars Trilogy and the first two Star Trek series, which ironically, the latter have failed to do in recent sequel attempts. I am hopeful Mr Whedon and the powers that be can find some way to revive the Firefly series. Perhaps given a second chance (or I suppose a third if you count the movie), the public will realize what great story-telling they have missed out on.
0684803356|5.0|Robert Jordan, an American in at least the third generation, and a teacher of Spanish from Montana, goes to fight in the Spanish Civil War. His motives are never discussed, as are not the theater of or the reasons for the war. The novel is rather about several people who, in the course of a few days, are helping Robert Jordan complete his mission: to blow up a bridge.    The novel's tall order - being \\"involved in Mankinde\\" to the extent of fighting thy neighbor's civil wars - is echoed in the story's close engagement with each character. Here is the natural-born killer Pablo, his no-nonsense and wise Gypsy wife Pilar, the beautiful young girl Maria who is carrying much pain, the good old rock of a man Anselmo, who fights to win this war, but who in his bones knows that thou shalt not kill.    Robert Jordan is singled out to have both the first and last name. All the other foreigners go by their last names and the Spaniards - by their first ones. Besides embodying the foreign engagement in the Spanish affair, Robert Jordan also brings a distinctly human element into the war zone: the lonely human name among the nomes de guerre of general Golzs and partisan Anselmos.    The book is written as if translated from Spanish. The language is a bit choppy, many expressions read like Spanish idioms translated verbatim, some phrases are left in Spanish. This adds to the feeling that one is in a foreign setting. As it often happens in Hemingway's novels, much working of the human spirit is revealed through this simple language.
B000005DSN|5.0|There are many albums by Stratovarius, but this one is likely the best, based on what I have heard and read.  The album art is spectacular, which hints at what you are about to hear when you play the album.  Sometimes the music sounds like it could help you soar above the clouds in a blissful Metal fantasy.  If you like Stratovarius' style but don't already have this album, do yourself a favor and get it.  You will not be disappointed.
0722534124|3.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" is short, pleasant tale of a shepherd boy faced with the choice of whether to live his \\"personal legend.\\" A seminary dropout, he wastes his time, intelligence and heart wandering the fields of Andalusia with his sheep. But then, a recurring dream sets him on a course that takes him out of his comfortable escapism and points him toward risk, personal growth and treasure. Along the way, he is assisted by kings and adepts who help him to perceive \\"the soul of the world\\" - that intuitive state in which all mysteries are One.<br /><br />The tale takes the boy from Spain to northern Africa. Mixing bits of Christian scriptures, Muslim exotica and Hindu mysticism, it shows a sensitive boy becoming increasingly attuned to the forces of nature. As in all such stories, it is a tale of a boy coming into control of himself as much as of the exterior world.<br /><br />Jeremy Irons is wonderful as the narrator, putting on a dozen voices -- from the wonder of an innocent lad, to the Cockney swagger of Nature to the burly growl of a camel driver.<br /><br />\\"The Alchemist\\" was not especially deep or theologicaly coherent. But its lessons about pursuing one's dream through self-initiative, attending to one's heart, and accepting the guidance of others, while somewhat time-worn, can always stand repeating.
B0000634EV|4.0|The follow up CD from Down is a damn good piece of southern fried metal but its not at the level of the first effort. Its not as consistantly excellent. It is however, more versitle and shows the wide range of interests and vast musical abilities of the various memembers of Down. There is alot more of Led Zeppelin's influence on this sophmore release whereas Nola showed the direct influence of Black Sabbath with some blues and hardcore sprinkled in.<br /><br />Choice cuts: \\"Ghosts of the Mississippi\\", \\"Beautifully Depressed\\", \\"Where I'm Going\\" and \\"Learn From My Mistake\\".
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Just as pictured above, the collector's boxset comes in a black box containing 2 items. The first item is a supplemental booklet containing film pictorials and literature about the history of Samurai, Japanese movie making, etc. It's informative and interesting, however, a one-time read. The second item is a foldout case film pictorial with 3 DVDs that resemble umbrellas from top view with their own distinct colors to distinguish their content. Overall design style gives one the mood of the film in mind.       The 1st disc contains the first half of the film up to the intermission and the picture quality compared to the 1998 Criterion is undeniably superior. The film itself is in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio with slight borders around the frame inorder for better viewing with most monitors. This edition contains the original mono sound track as well as a new stereo sound track, however, I prefer the original mono due to being an enthusiast. There are also two commentary selections. One is the original 1988 commentary of Michael Jeck from the 1998 Criterion, which is fantastic! The second commentary is comprised of 5 film scholars, and each are given roughly 40 minutes of commentary spotlight in various parts of the film, which is also fantastic! Listening to both commentaries gives you a greater understanding of this superb film.       The first disc also contains some production photos from the film as well as some posters of the film from several countries. The second disc contains the second half of the film right after the intermission with the continuation of the audio tracks. This second disc contains an extra feature called \\"It Is Wonderful To Create\\", which is a 55 minute documentary of Akira Kurosawa's films with his collaborators.       The third disc contains a two hour interview with Akira Kurosawa as well as origins and influences of how this film came to fruition. I really wanted to see more interviews from the stars themselves, especially the great Toshiro Mifune. The third disc will probably be a one-time view. I believe, Criterion could've contained the film in its entirety on one disc and included all the extra features on the second disc inorder to streamline this otherwise great release.        Overall, an extremely satisfying new release of Seven Samurai that should definitely be included in any fans dvd collection. I have watched this film over a dozen times with great joy and satisfaction and now I can enjoy it even more with this wonderful collector's edition!
B000001EL3|2.0|This is not Kiss's best effort. They should have followed the hard rocking \\"Alive\\" with something better. Destroyer sounds forced, overproduced and overlush. There is alot of filler and alot of guest writers. Actually, this isn't really a Kiss record. Its a Bob Ezrin record and a crappy one at that. Kiss should have stuck with Eddie Kramer as producer. He gets the best out of Kiss and doesn't try to make them something they aren't. We can also thank Bob Ezrin for another blemish in the Kiss catalogue: The Elder.<br /><br />Best tracks: \\"God of Thunder\\", \\"Detroit Rock City\\"
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|V for Vendetta, the film, is certainly not a bad movie but it is a poor adaptation of the brilliant graphic novel.  If you, like me, found the comic book version of V to be deeply moving and influential, I can't recommend that you watch the movie version.  If you haven't read the comic, go ahead and see the movie, but then go and read the far superior book.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman (surprisingly) both provide very solid performances as V and Evey, and the design of the film was perfect.  My only problems are the changes to the script which diluted the original story and replaced it with a happy and unambiguous ending.  There are at least four important scenes in the original book's narrative; V's backstory, Evey's imprisonment, the history of the woman in room IV, and V's death.  The film only gets two of these scenes done well (the imprisonment and the woman in room IV) while the other scences were deleted or changed in ways which made them meaningless.<br /><br />Judged on its own merits, the movie is not bad, but anyone who is interested in the storytelling should read Alan Moore's graphic novel instead.  Had the movie stayed true to Moore's original exploration of totalitarianism and anarchy, this could have been a masterpiece.  As it stands, its an engaging piece of entertainment but not anything more.<br /><br />As a contemporary political movie, I was impressed that the movie was so willing to address issues of terrorism and treason against a totalitarian state.  Even if the movie was flawed, it opened up a much-needed dialogue about the extent of governmental control during an endless war on terrorism, and the low worth of a society which values its security over the freedom of its citizens.
B000002HJR|5.0|What would happen if five guys who grew up jamming to Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Slayer, Lynyrd Skynrd and the Allman Brothers decided to form a band. What if those five guys just happened to be some of the most baddass musicians of this century. Well, you would have Down.<br />Down is a real rock/metal supergroup. Nola has got all the rage and power of Pantera but with more melody and a touch of the southern blues. Nola is one of the greatest CDs produced in the last 10-15 years. Down is the best thing to happen to Metal in a long time. Can Down reviatalize the metal genre in this day and age? Well, they do for me son...They do it for me..<br /><br />Best cuts: \\"Lifer\\", Temptations Wings\\" \\"Stone the Crow\\", \\"Jail\\" and \\"Bury Me in Smoke\\".
B0007Y08IS|2.0|Team America had all the ingredients for a really great movie. By utilizing the Supermarionation-style puppetry and merging it with pop culture and political satire, it could have been the most original movie of the year. Unfortunately, Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem to be addicted to vulgarity, and the flurry of f-words in their theatrical films would have made Richard Pryor blush. The few clever satirical points they made were overshadowed by the foul language, graphic sex, and gratuitous violence that was peppered all over the film. I was particularly turned off by the ridiculously long puking scene, as well as the homosexual encounter between Gary and his boss. <br />Ultimately, I found Team America: World Police to be a disappointing waste of time, when it could have been a tribute to those wonderful Gerry Anderson kid shows we watched back in the 1960's.
B000001EKX|5.0|Kiss's heaviest record is also their best. At the time, Kiss were looking for their sound and they stumbled into grunge 20 years before anyone else. This record is raw, stark, distorted, strange and heavy. It features some of Ace Frehley's finest song writing contributions and some solid songs from Gene and Paul. The band was still lean and hungry at this point and the music comes across as loud, evil and nasty.<br /><br />Best tracks: \\"Parasite\\", \\"Watchin You\\", Strange Ways\\" and \\"Got to Choose\\".
B00005ATQF|5.0|The first half of this film is the most accurate portrayal of USMC boot camp I have ever seen, outside of actually being there. I've read that R. Lee Emery, who played the senior drill instructor, was initially hired to coach other actors for the role. But he did such a perfect job himself that Stanley Kubrick hired him for the job. If the film had ended after the first half alone, it would have been phenomenal.<br /><br />The second half of the film portrays the same boot camp Marines from the first half who are now in Viet Nam. The tone and the setting are much different as the men engage in a number of battle situations, including a fairly gruesome scene with a female sniper.<br /><br />Where the first half of this film is almost comical at times, the second half is much more serious and grave. Overall, this is a serious and engaging movie that brilliantly describes military experiences on and off the battlefield.
B00006YXOX|3.0|Bruckner is my favorite composer.  I have multiple recordings of all of his symphonies, three of his 3rd, 4th, and 7th, and four of his 5th and 8th.  If you are looking for one set of Bruckner's symphonies that will give you an idea of what each symphony has to offer, I would recommend Karajan's cycle (which I have), not this one.  The strengths of this (Jochum's) set are the first three symphonies, which are played with amazing energy which I have yet to hear bested by any other recording - Karajan's certainly comes more than close enough to give you the full idea, though.  The real weaknesses of this set are the poor recording quality (it was recorded in the 50s and 60s after all, so one cannot expect much in this department) and the later symphonies.  Jochum's style with Bruckner is characterized by bombastic playing in the scherzos and such, and just yada-yadaing through the slower parts to get back to the bombastic stuff.  This works spectacularly well in the earlier symphonies, but not so well in the later symphonies, as the highlights of the later symphonies are the slower parts, which Karajan does extremely well (many people, in fact, complain that Karajan's too focused on these aspects of classical music).  As for the recording quality, if you are just ripping the music to mp3 files on your computer or mp3 player and playing it on the standard soundcard/headphones, the recording quality will probably be good enough (that's the way I listened to it when I first got it, and I was satisfied with the recording quality), but if you will be playing it on anything at all better than average, there is a good chance that these recordings will show their age.  FWIW, as far as recordings of individual symphonies, these are the ones that, to me, are almost certainly about as good as it can get: <br /> <br />3- Tintner (this one sounds startlingly different from any other interpretation of this symphony, because it's Bruckner's first version, which was vastly differentfrom the highly edited version most play)  <br />5- Harnoncourt & the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra <br />7- Karajan & the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra <br />8- Karajan & the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra <br />9- Harnoncourt & the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is great for Led Zeppelin fans. For a very low price you're getting over five hours of music and footage that is nicely compiled and presented. The bulk of the music includes the Zeppelin tunes I like to listen to, and not too many long (and sometimes strange) guitar solos. The live concert footage and the interviews are also quite interesting.<br /><br />If you have a computer at work that plays DVDs, you can stick this in and just listen to it as if it were a CD. Very cool. Buy it.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album belongs in every rock collection.  If you love Nirvana, buying \\"Nevermind\\" is a no-brainer, but if you have disposable income and you want to \\"beef up\\" your rock collection, then \\"Nevermind\\" needs to be in your audio collection.<br /><br />I love Nirvana and I listen to this album often enough to know every second by heart.  I grew up with this album; \\"Nevermind\\" came out when I was in elementary school, and now I listen to it while a college student.  This album defines longevity.<br /><br />Buy the album (because it sells for only a few lousy dollars) and pretend that the album is a new release.  I don't tell people how old this album is- I just play it for them and they want a copy.  1991 was a very good year...
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|A few years before this movie came out, a movie called \\"Tommy\\" came out. This movie took the concept album of The Who's \\"Tommy\\" and transferred it to the big-screen, using only music and absolutely no dialogue to further the story along. I never turn off a movie, no matter how bad I think it is. Except \\"Tommy.\\" In reality, the film wasn't bad...It just annoyed me. There was a huge lack of entertainment going on. I wasn't expecting much from The Wall, but I've heard so many good things about it. I had to see it. Let me say, I haven't heard a lot of Pink Floyd stuff. I've only listened to four albums (Umma Gumma, Dark Side of the Moon, Atom Heart Mother, and Wish You Were Here). Yes, that's right. I haven't even heard The Wall album. This film is simalar to Tommy in the fact that Pink Floyd's music plays throughout the film. The difference is, there is some dialogue in the film although it doesn't move the plot along at all. The other difference is, this film has amazing visuals and is fun to watch. The movie's plot is basically a rock star named Pink (Bob Geldof) sits watching a war movie and begins to remember his childhood. Blended in is memories, fantasies, and a bunch of other [...] that results in one trippy movie to watch. But, as I said, the visuals are what keep you watching. The movie's metaphors (especially the title one) are very smart, the script is by Roger Waters (although I don't know how a person could write a script like this). If you're a Floyd fan/arty kinds of films, check this out for sure. All movies, in my opinion, are forms of art...But this film is actually like a work of art. Anyway, if you're just a moviegoer looking for some entertainment on a Saturday night...This isn't the movie for you.    GRADE: A-
9707704667|3.0|¿Cual es el verdadero rostro del amor? Es la pregunta que se encuentra en la contraportada de \\"Travesuras de la niña mala\\", desafortunadamente ésta no es contestada a lo largo de la lectura. <br /> <br /> <br />La protagonista de esta novela es una mujer ambiciosa y manipuladora que se ampara en la pobreza sufrida para justificar sus actos egoístas. Una pobreza que el autor no describe, imposibilitando al lector a sentir simpatía por el personaje. Un personaje unidimensional <br />que perpetua el estereotipo  de la mujer latina  capaz de vender su cuerpo y más- su dignidad por unos trapos.  <br /> <br />El es un hombre aburrido consigo mismo, que se somete a un sin fin de humillaciones para salir de su tedio, en manos de esta mujer la cual el llama \\"niña mala\\", un mero eufemismo. <br /> <br />El tiempo no sana a ninguno de los dos de su patología y el autor pretende vendernos la idea que una tortura tan larga, por ser larga debe ser amor.  <br />La verdad, ambos personajes pertenecen a la silla de un terapeuta. <br />
B000BTGY1O|5.0|I've never had a particular urge to see Breakfast at Tiffany's. I'll watch any movie, but there's a few that I don't want to spend money on and such. I found this movie at the library and figured \\"why not?\\" and here's my review; <br />The movie is based on a novel by Truman Capote (the subject of last year's \\"Capote\\" and this year's \\"Injustice\\") and stars Audrey Hepburn in one of her most famous roles. For anyone who didn't know this, Hepburn doesn't play a character named Tiffany...Tiffany's is the name of a jewelry store. Anyway, <br />Hepburn plays Holly Golightly, an eccentric playgirl who lives in a barren apartment with a nameless cat and uses men as a way to make money. She's not a golddigger, but whatever she is...It's pretty close. Holly needs money and she's in the middle of looking for a wealthy man to marry when the less-than-wealthy Paul Varjak (George Peppard), a writer, moves in next door. The two exchange romance candor and Holly begins calling him Fred (after her brother, who's in the army). The romance doesn't seem like it's going anywhere; After all, Holly is looking for Mr. \\"Rich\\" Right and Paul (Fred) is a poor writer who also seems to be a kind of male prostitute to one woman who lives in 2E. Of course, this is a romantic-comedy so you know that they're going to hook up...But what happens in between is actually pretty entertaining and funny. I suppose most of the humor comes from the fact that the film is directed by Blake Edwards (of The Pink Panther fame)...The majority of comedic relief comes from Mr. Yunioshi (Mickey Rooney), the \\"Japanese\\" manager of Holly's building who has to frequently remind her to keep the noise down. Mr. Yunioshi is, of course, a tanned Mickey Rooney with fake teeth yelling in a fake accent. He's hilarious though, truly a great character. Another character I liked was the cat, Cat. Sure it's a simple character, but I don't know man...The cat was cool. Hepburn and Peppard's chemistry is great, this movie was made in 1961 but the picture is perfect. <br />This is truly a gem from the 60s. If you liked movies like When Harry Met Sally, then you should definitely like this. A wonderful movie. <br /> <br />GRADE: A-
B00079FUI6|3.0|I've just finished watching the first four episodes of the first season of Desperate Housewives, and I was quite enjoying myself.  The show successfully combines multiple genres including comedy, soap opera and a season long mystery.  But whose thick-headed idea was it to include bonus material on disk one with spoilers for the remainder of the season?  Beware: if you are watching this series for the first time, the bonus feature \\"A Walk Down Wisteria Lane\\" reveals not one, but several key mystery plot developments prematurely.  Any grade schooler would have known to include this feature on the final disk.
6305807086|4.0|\\"Being John Malkovich\\" was one of the most critically acclaimed and original films of 1999. They've taken a premise that everyone has thought about (What would it be like to be someone else?) and spins it into What if you could be one of the greatest living actors? That's exactly what was done here and it wielded some slightly demented results. John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a loser puppeteer with nothing going for him. He has no job and lives with his pet-crazed wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz, who looks very different). Craig, in need of work, gets a job as a filing clerk at a building where his floor has a low overhead and everyone is forced to walk hunched over. There, Craig meets the woman of his dreams Maxine (Catherine Keener, who recieved an Oscar nominated for this role). Maxine, however, is a cold-hearted and mean person who doesn't care about Craig. After dropping a file behind a cabinet, Craig discovers a portal into the brain of John Malkovich. You can enter the portal and for five minutes see the world through the eyes of Malkovich. As Craig slowly learns how to stay inside Malkovich permanently, the story gets even more demented. The movie has a solid first act, but after Craig becomes Malkovich I thought it veered off course for a little bit. Malkovich (as himself) is great; The only thing he proves here is that he is one of the best actors of this generation. All the performances are strong, although I thought Diaz was better than Keener and probably deserved a nomination a little more. The film is a dark-comedy in the classic sense. It's comedic, with only a few jokes...But some of them are pretty funny. (A semi-running joke involves people telling Malkovich how much they loved him in the movie where he played a jewel thief. Malkovich has never played a jewel thief.) This was the debut film by Spike Jonze, who had previously found success directing music videos. Watching the brief interview featured on the DVD is very odd and kind of weird. Oscar winner Charlie Kaufman (Best Original Screenplay, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind') penned the movie, so if you've seen the aforementioned film or Adaptation...You know what you're in for. Not for everybody, but definitely original. <br /> <br />GRADE: B+
B00008WG3U|1.0|I know many punks and leftists will immediately give a \\"Not Helpful\\" vote to this review, but to be honest, I don't really care. What annoys me about NOFX and Fat Mike is that the same thing that would annoy me about a punk purist: It's all about \\"being punk\\", even if it includes things that are real hypocrisy. For example, \\"Medio-core\\", about how mainstream music is boring and unimaginative. They may always stick to being punks and never went on a major label, but really, they don't sound that far from the pop-punk that the purists despise. It seems like this was a reminder to show people that they were into politics, and there was even punkvoter.com made for the people. Unfortunately, I don't always know if I could buy the punk politics and it is not a fun album to listen to at all. \\"The Idiots Are Taking Over\\" could've really been written by anyone and is awful, possibly the worst of these songs. Also annoying is the way they try to shout out on how they're punk on the album. To any outsider, it's like they're trying to convince people. Not quite as bad as Anti-Flag, but not much better, either...
B000055Y0Y|5.0|Movies about presidential assassinations (whether fictional or non-fictional) are usually lame. They follow the same formula and they always end the same. I guess, technically, \\"In the Line of Fire\\" is nothing new for this kind of movie but it's got an exciting plot, awesome acting, and well basically...Despite the familar formula, it's a damn good movie. Clint Eastwood plays a Secret Service agent named Frank Horrigan, who is still haunted by the fact that he could've saved Kennedy from being assassinated had he reacted quicker. Since this incident, Frank has been reduced to a drunken under-cover Secret Service agent who longs for something meaninful to happen. It does in the form of Mitch Leary (John Malkovich, in an Oscar nominated performance). After Frank follows up on a tip that Leary may be up to something, he recieves a phone call from Leary who tells him that he is going to assassinate the Presidents. It seems doors are re-opening for Frank. As Frank and Leary begin talking to each other over the phone, while Frank and the rest of the agents descend upon the case it becomes clear that Leary is no ordinary crazy assassin. Rene Russo co-stars as Lilly Raines, a female Secret Service agent and the love interest of Frank. Dylan McDermott also co-stars as Frank's partner Al. Anyway, the plot is good...It has its moments of predictability, but I actually must admit that Leary's decision at the end genuinely surprised me. Anyway, I don't watch many Eastwood movies (I've only seen some movies he's directed, Any Which Way You Can, Escape from Alcatraz, and that's about it); I think, in all, I've seen 5 movies he's acted in. But I can honestly say that this is, probably, one of his strongest performances. Malkovich is what made me want to see this movie, the man is an amazing actor folks. Every film I've seen him in, he fascinates the viewer. Here, the casting doesn't get much better for his role. I can't think of another actor who could play Leary as well as Malkovich. I'm not sure if it was Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive) or Martin Landau (Ed Wood) he lost the Oscar to, but this is a completely Oscar worthy performance here. Russo is good (she has the strong look of a career woman, but can be vulnerable to Franks \\"charm.\\"), as is the rest of the cast. <br />But, Eastwood and Malkovich are the core of this film. Out of all the films I've seen by director Wolfgang Petersen (I've only seen The Perfect Storm and Poseidon), this is definitely his best. <br /> <br />GRADE: A
B00067ISBU|5.0|I really do not know why I originally bought this DVD. I mean, I've never followed the Hellboy comics, nor did I think that the trailer looked all that interesting, yet something made me go ahead and buy it. I am so glad that I did. The only reason I gave this film five stars is that I could not give it more.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, this film has everything- constantly witty and clever dialog, believable acting, first class sets, great special effects- and most importantly for me, mythological power. What does make a man a man? If you raise up a demon from the deepest pit of hell to know the difference between right and wrong, good and evil, does that make him a man? Yes, if you teach him that he has the power to choose his own path- and he takes it. It is even more impressive when the subject has no hope of salvation, yet he chooses light and good for their own sake. And it doesn't hurt to teach him the meaning and power of love. That's the other thing about this film- it turns out to be one of the best love stories that I've ever seen.<br /><br />I would by this DVD again for my permanent library without the slightest hesitation. I've watched it through several times and always came away with a sense of... inspiration.

B000BCKFWK|5.0|Anyone whose read my other reviews can tell you that I HATE multiple DVD releases.  We all know it's either the studios or the filmmakers (probably both) trying to milk as much cash as possible from the fans.  Robert Rodriguez, one of the \\"young turk\\" filmmakers of the '90s, I think, now suffers from the \\"Lucas Syndrome\\" - that is, the \\"I'm justified in making as much money as I can from my artistic vision because I worked my way to the top\\" mentality that true all-around film artists develop once they become part of \\"the Establishment\\" they hated so much as youngsters.  Maybe so.  I'd believe this too if Rodriguez hadn't earlier showed himself to be all about the fans with his previous home-video releases.  Still and all, this guy really DOES deserve it to the extent that, unlike George, he's more \\"hands-on\\" than anyone in Hollywood because A: he wears ALL the creative hats behind the camera, and B: the man believes - REALLY believes - in outdoing himself creatively. <br /> <br />Which brings us to \\"Sin City\\" - the theatrical cut, the \\"director's cut,\\" and the DVD's.  I feel, and this is just my opinion, that the bear-bones first home release was just to get a quick cash flow and tweak Disney for the way they treated the Weinstein brothers.  How else can you explain why Rodriguez would release a version with only the Electronic Press Kit (EPK) as a \\"special feature\\" (and the only one at that)?  Yet it was good for the movies' sake, because \\"Sin City\\" was yet another bold new direction for Sir Robert.  In many interviews he was quoted that the flaw of adapting comic book titles to the screen was adapting them to the realities of motion picture. Here, he made the film medium adapt to the comics, and created something new.  Something truly revolutionary in film.  Something that was disturbingly beautiful.  He did more than make four of Frank Miller's noir series work on film - he (along with Miller, who gets a co-directing nod) made film work around the comic's artistic motifs. <br /> <br />This wasn't easy.  To do it, he had to film every single actor in green screen and create a reality around them; sometimes with noone to react to where they would be later seen to be talking to another person.  It's been done before - the beautiful but flawed \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" comes to mind - but here it works. <br /> <br />For those who, like me, couldn't wait for the second cut (a mistake I WON'T be repeating with \\"Blade Runner\\") - one might feel resentful with having to purchase yet another DVD.  Well, put that out of your mind because, not only do we get all the extras goodness - studio featurettes, an interactive character's guide to Basin City, and the quirky Rodriguez behind-the-scenes \\"film schools,\\" green screen rushes, party footage, etc. - but we see the complete Sin City stories recut, added to, and retold, yet again in their original format.  Sure, they didn't add a whole lot of new footage, but what's there further develops the stories as Frank Miller wrote them.  With all this, you get a paperback reprint of \\"The Long Goodbye,\\" three new commentary tracks, and the satisfaction that this repurchase was WORTH the cash. <br /> <br />Besides, worse case scenario, you can resell your first \\"Sin City\\" DVD used.  I guarentee you, with this cut, you won't need it.
1577314808|3.0|I loved the 1st part of this book up until about page 100.  It articulated Zen in a very impressive way.  There were multiple aspects I'm applying to my life, e.g., the mind is prone to compulsive thinking and that it's a \\"disease,\\" and, of course, living in the present. <br /> <br />The 2nd part seemed to degenerate into the \\"mumbo-jumbo\\" that Time Magazine opined.  It seems to me Mr. Tolle tried & failed to make the Bible, etc., fit his theories.  He also failed to properly credit Buddhism and their ilk for present-moment living.  <br /> <br />As other reviewers have noted, he doesn't tell you how to achieve his recommendations either. <br /> <br />All in all, I'm glad I read it, but skimmed the last 1/2 as it was very repetitive and nonsensical.   <br /> <br />Mr. Tolle did manage to really encapsulate great ideas in the 1st half.  I've been reading a few books on Zen living and this fits, but had I not been apprised of Buddhism, I wouldn't have benefitted much from \\"The Power of Now.\\"

Vienna on film is foreboding (despite the fact that it was really Prague).  The sound is horrible, and the sepia tone (to brand this a period piece) was overstated.  Virtually none of the film is constructed by action, it is all dialogue.  Definitely, these are all marks of a first-time director.  And Rufus Sewell's mustache is atrocious (I did love his hall of animal racks, however...it was truly ludicrous).  I was drawn to the film and taken in by the plot and what might have been for this film.  Despite the slow pacing, (and a remarkable lack of chemistry between Biel and Norton)it managed to overcome most of the deficiencies.

B0001XAODY|5.0|For me, this is the best superhero movie yet (including \\"Superman(1978),\\" \\"Spider-Man II\\" and \\"Batman Begins\\"). It is true to his origins, develops the characters well and it connects very well on a human level. While there is humor, it is not the corny \\"action hero\\" humor that plagued so many Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and other superhero movies such as the Batman movies. In fact, the Spider-Man comic books themselves always had a good deal of humor and this movie is consistent with that. Even though Sam Raimi had established himself as a director prior to making the Spider-Man films, he is the perfect choice for this because he understands the character and the nature of this comic so well. So rarely is a superhero movie made by a director who fundamentally understands its subject. In that sense, this movie is a dream come true for fans of this comic. Until \\"Batman Begins,\\" this was really the first superhero movie to accurately portray its character onscreen. As with the comic books, it makes the violence seem as though it really should hurt, yet our hero is practically unscathed. This seems counterintuitive, yet it makes the movie faithful to its comic hero source and ultimately more realistic. And then there is the love story, which is realistic because Mary Jane dates Harry Osborn, the good looking, wealthy jerk actually unworthy of her. True to life, she dates him for all the wrong reasons and unwisely stays with him despite common sense. She is the unattainable for Peter Parker, the intelligent, thoroughly decent kid who has the misfortune of being penniless and average looking. Once he attains his powers, he knows he will forever endanger those close to him. This turns his ostensible blessing into a curse. Not an enviable position because it affects those closest to him. The movie features excellent graphics and effects, very good acting, a terrific story and script, and just about everything one could want in a movie. The sum total is a film so entertaining and so good, even my wife left the theater proclaiming it her new favorite film. (While her regular viewing entails Bollywood films, her other favorite films include \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\") High praise indeed.ing and so good, even my wife left the theater proclaiming it her new favorite film.

B000063DI8|3.0|Only true classics deserve 5 stars, whereas only corporate drivel deserves 1 star, like a Britney Spears album. Iron Maiden's 8th record earns 2 1/2 stars. <br /> <br />'No Prayer for the Dying' was recorded during a tumultuous time. It saw guitarist Adrian Smith (H) leave the band due to musical differences and featured the debut of Jannick Gers. Also, at the time the band was going through an image problem and had other personnel issues.  <br /> <br />The album marked a return to a stripped-down sound, like 'Killers' or their debut. At the end of the day, however, the only songs that are up to Maiden standards are Holy Smoke, the title track, Mother Russia, and to a lesser extent, Tailgunner. These are all good songs. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the rest of the album is uneven and uninspired. There's no innovation. The songs generally have an unremarkable melody, weak riff, a poor vocal performance by Bruce, or a combination of all three. In some songs half of it works, half of it falls flat on its face. Of course, some songs are just unlistenable. I would gladly zap BYDTTS from Maiden's existence. The Assassin is even worse.  <br /> <br />The problems surrounding the band were many: <br /> <br />1. Image-wise, Maiden wanted to get away from the theatrics of their previous 3 classics -- PS, SiT, SSoaSS -- which took the listener on a musical journey to three mystical worlds. In theory this may have been a good idea, but the results of the record showed they didn't have a new unified vision or purpose to turn to. <br /> <br />2. They suffered from the absence of H's \\"perfectionism\\" and knack for good riffs.  <br /> <br />3. Direction-wise, lead singer Bruce Dickinson and founder Steve Harris were butting heads on music and production. Simiarly, Bruce was getting irritated about being affiliated with the whole Eddie thing, and swore he couldn't see himself doing metal in 10 years.. he'd retire by then. He was clearly uncomfortable in the band during this time. <br /> <br />4. The sound got a little more poppy and the lyrics a bit un-Maiden like. In addition, Bruce's raspy delivery undercut the quality of some of the songs.  <br /> <br />In sum, the record wasn't disappointing (by Maiden standards) because it had a stripped-down sound -- it was a let-down  because the band did not produce good songs.

B000FVQM2Y|4.0|The movie has a great pace and a really interesting feel.  <br />It does take place in a high school setting - but that hardly seems to matter. <br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has blossomed as an actor siince his time on 3rd Rock, did a spectacular job of taking the audience through the dark world of drugs and super hip and smart players as he tries to find a killer. And in true film noir style the person that pulled the trigger isn't even the one you end up blaming so much as the person that set the wheels in motion.  <br />The dialogue takes a few minutes to adjust to but once you start emersing yourself into what the director has created you become part of it. Because it is an alternate world. This terribly dark chic place isn't where the rest of us dwell. But it was a lot of fun to visit.

B000F7CMRM|1.0|This movie has been referred to as being like Traffic because of the multiple plot threads.  This may be, but unlike Traffic I found the effect disjointed and uninteligible.  It's not that it is difficult to follow per se, the issue is that you have multiple stories that you don't care about and that have no impact on you as the viewer.  Four of us watched Syriana together (so I was not alone) and not one of us understood the point of it come the end.  I will not pass on the actual words used to describe it other than to say very poor would have been much kinder. <br /> <br />One to miss

0807126063|4.0|Ignatius J. Reilly is one of the most brilliantly designed characters I've encountered in fiction. Agoraphobic, narcissistic, and hilarious, his adventures in New Orleans kept me laughing out loud. This is truly side-splitting humor. It's distressing to know that John Kennedy Toole never lived to see the fruition of his work, Pulitzer, etc. Initially, I was quite repulsed by Ignatius. His lewd fantasy of oral sex with a dog streaming through his mind while he masturbates early in the book was a shocker. His hypochondriasis (he has a valve problem of sorts...a somatization probably related to his poor dietary habits) is comical to say the least. He is really an unbelievable character. It's really hard to analyze him, e.g. is he schizoid, narcissistic, brilliant, mentally challenged???? He's an intriguing character and full of surprises. Again and again, you'll be in disbelief as his eccentric behaviors, comments and tendencies emanate inexorably throughout the novel, repeatedly catching you off guard. <br /> <br />The lower dregs of New Orleans are brilliantly depicted. I currently live in New Orleans, but read the book prior to relocating. Now, as I meander through the city, I constantly think of Ignatius and his shenanigans. Some grow to pity Ignatius as they read through the book. For me, I grew increasingly curious about the inner workings of Toole's person and mind, often thinking back to the synopsis of his life and suicide given in the jacket cover. It's a pity the world never knew John Kennedy Toole. Perhaps he was as pitiful as his cantankerous protagonist? <br /> <br />This book, although a brilliant comedy, is very mysterious. It's a very unique work and I've found that it has a massive following. More than once, I've brought up Ignatius J. Reilly in casual conversations with friends and acquaintances, always finding someone in the group that loves the novel as much as I do. I've never met anyone that dislikes it. <br /> <br />Beware, it's very sexually explicit and crass, but has left me laughing for years and years.

B000002A3T|1.0|I just cant warm up to anything on this album. It reminds me of some of the NewAge stuff back in the 80s mixed with some of the candy rock of the time. Like George Winston's piano on \\"Winter\\" where the pauses between the notes added meaning. It seems Gilmour was playing with the space between the notes. Definitely not the space between his ears. If you like this try Jean Michelle Jarre or Kitaro. They do a much better job. Lord knows I've tried to listen to MLOR and Division Bell but PF truely died with the parting of Waters. This is just retire money for Gilmour or he as gone by way of Sid Barrett.

The singing is less than pleasant, forced and strained from a worn out rocker. The music is a jarbled New Age sounding studio mix of repetitive beats. Water's was correct when he said Pink Floyd was a spent creative force. If there is a message in the album or a theme its obscured by clouds of senseless notes and endless whaling guitar riffs. I think Gilmour wanted some retirement money and kicked out the last two PF albums to grow old on easy street. Or he followed the path of Sid Barret and slid off the deep end.
B000I2JKE2|5.0|This is more of preview than a review, but I think you'll find the information useful.   <br /> <br />Superman fans paid a heavy price for the misguided firing of director Richard Donner with all of Superman I and 70% of Superman II already in the can.  The resulting version of Superman II we all endured was re-shot by the far inferior  director Richard Lester. <br /> <br />The film was a financial success, but it was a mess.  It was far too campy and, despite an interesting premise, it was the beginning of the long downward spiral of the franchise. <br /> <br />The unseen footage that Donner shot was widely believed to have been lost or discarded, but luckily for us, it wasn't.  Using footage from Lester's version to fill in any gaps, this version is going to be a dream come true for Superman fans.  So, in the year that saw the return of Superman in Bryan Singer's faithful film, we will get to see the late Christopher Reeve strap on the tights one more time.   <br /> <br />2006:  Superman Returns....Again. <br /> <br />

B0000C8AV3|5.0|This is one of my favorite Dylan releases.  I recently purchased it after being a longtime fan of 'Jokerman', one of the most interesting songs Dylan ever wrote.<br /><br />The instrumentation and sound are pure products of the 80's but the songs are not simplistic in the least.  And let's face it.  As much as I loved the music of the 80's the lyrics were usually simple and silly.<br /><br />This is a great cd that remains a pleasure to hear and has all the confusion of rubik's cube when you start to try and figure out what Bob's trying to tell us.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Pick up any of several volumes within the revered Library of America series (esp. Crime Novels of the 1930's and 1940's), and it is easy to see how noir fiction became such a rich source of creative movie-making. \\"Brick\\" is the latest in a series of great (\\"Chinatown,\\" \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" \\"Blue Velvet\\") and very good movies (\\"L.A. Confidential,\\" \\"Heist,\\" \\"The Grifters,\\" \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\") that use the trappings of noir literature and earlier noir films. \\"Brick\\" adapts the dialogue and plots of Dashiell Hammett to a setting familiar to the screenwriter/director: a Southern California high school, the cliques of teenagers therein, and a familiarity with illicit drug dealing. The speech of the characters works because the teenagers are still kids, despite the serious themes and deadly consequences.     There's humor inherent in putting young people into the noir setting, but its not the noir that's the target of easy jokes. It's not so much a joke, as in \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,\\" that the main character gets himself beat up, but the humor comes from a tense confrontation between gumshoes and kingpin being interrupted by the kingpin's mom serving orange juice. Funny in \\"Brick,\\" but also a point of realism: drug dealers are often teenagers who do in fact bring their business (and violence) into their parents' kitchens. Much of the surreal \\"where I eat lunch\\" type of dialogue can be seen as a device to show how a lot of teens turn to dope and dope-dealing to shoehorn themselves into adult roles. The only meaningful adult-teen interaction, fittingly, comes between Gordon-Levitt's character and the school principal, played by the great Richard Roundtree.    The acting in this film is top-notch and a great pleasure to see. The empty high school setting reflects the isolation the protagonist lives in, and we are shown only the meaningful (or perhaps remembered) aspects of his days. Compare this to another earnest film about high school, \\"Elephant,\\" and it's easy to see how professional actors and the elimination of background clutter makes for a better presentation. It's also nice to see that \\"Brick\\" has a healthy number of passionate defenders on the Amazon page. Hopefully, Gordon-Levitt continues to take on roles like the ones in \\"Brick\\" and \\"Mysterious Skin.\\" His generation badly needs its own Jack Nicholson.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|When I saw this film upon its theatrical release in May 2005, I agreed with the one film critic who stated that Kingdom of Heaven was \\"spectacular, yet empty\\". Granted, I expected Orlando Bloom's Balien to be similar to Russell Crowe's Maximus from Gladiator and was let down, but beyond that, there was something so potentially graceful about the film that I just didn't see. That cinematic potential is realized in the Director's Cut version which is vastly superior to the theatrical release. What makes the Cut so much better is the much needed treatment of further explaining the characters and their motives which exacts a far better and less fragmented storyline.  <br /> <br />Bloom's Balien was never intended to be the over-the-top Crusader Knight which many people like me initially expected. Bloom plays the main character with such control and subtlety that his redemption in the Holy Land becomes a realistic and compelling journey. His underplayed portrayal serves as a counterweight to the other more bombastic and larger-than-life characters who project the violent conflicts and politics in Jerusalem. Balien's ability to successfully navigate these landmines yet still retain his humanity is the real focus of the story, and this theme like Balien is subtle and requires patience to fully grasp. As for the other characters, they don't necessarily overshadow Balien, but rather underscore his quest for redemption which turns out to be more human than spiritual. It is this treatment of redemption that makes the film worthwhile. <br /> <br />As for the film's production values, it's a Ridley Scott movie to the core. It is the time of the Second Crusades and Scott wastes no time or effort in providing the appearance and feel for that historical period. I project that in years to come, this film will be a classic period piece and with good reason.  <br />
B000G759LW|4.0|Christina has what is arguably the best voice in pop culture. She really shines on the first disk with throwback vintage and samples of hip hop and rap tracks. Things start to go downhill after the first disk. The second cd was in my option thrown together which she should have stuck to the basics. With that said because of the first disc I highly recommend what is Christina best effort to date. <br />
B000GRUMPU|4.0|I wish I had not have listened so intently to the reviews when this movie was released into the Theatres. The reviews were so bad, except that many concurred that the special effects were great. Not wanting to waste the ticket price on a film with little in the heart of character development and soul, I opted to wait for the DVD to be released.  <br />I just watched it tonight, and I didn't expect much, and what the critics had said was true in a way. They somehow didn't hit the same note with the characters that the Original 1972 movie hit. The sequence of events leading up to the rogue wave having it's way with the luxury liner like a cigar floating in the sea, did lack a more engaging plot.  I felt moments of let down because of this, but this was soon overshadowed by the suspense and sweeping special effects that truly command this movie. The characters may not have been that developed, but it was just enough to keep me hooked into the thrill of this movie. This movie is a great thrill ride and the critical reviews of it are a sad example of how a tremendous amount of masterful work can be overlooked. If you get this DVD, be sure to watch the special feature on the making of the movie. You will surely be impressed with what the actors and crew went through to bring this amazing spectacle to the screen.  <br />This is not the original Poseiden, but if you liked the original, the special effects and sequence of action unfold in a new and fun way. After all, while the original was a groundbreaking movie in it's genre, I really don't think it was meant to be much more than a good action movie. This version also delivers a great action movie with impressive, up to date effects.  <br />Lastly, I wish I'd seen this one on the big screen while I had the chance. It would have been a great ride.

B000002KJM|1.0|This is in regard to the 1980's recomposed/remastered version of ZZ Top's First Album.  Ditto all of the comments about the awfulness of the reverb and fake drums.  What's really sad is what was printed on the back of the vinyl LP jacket in 1970: <br /> <br />\\"In this day of homogenized rock, synthesized music, retakes, overdubbing, multi, multi-tracking, an honest recording by accomplished musicians is a rewarding pleasure.  Z Z TOP'S FIRST ALBUM is just such a recording.  This is the way blues-rock is meant to be played: openly, honestly, and spontaneously.  It takes an experienced sensitive group such as Z Z TOP to capture the abstract blues from within and combine it with the ability to feel and play good hard rock without losing their communication.\\" <br /> <br />17 years later, they trashed their own philosophy.  Tres Hombres, and Fandango by Rhino, are the first honest digital transfers of the original first 5 ZZ Top albums.
B00005JOQS|1.0|Superman Returns is the Batman and Robin of the Superman movies. It is just God awful. The story is horrendous and the special effects were much too over the top. As stupid as this sounds, the movie was too much like a movie. Watching Superman I, II, And IV, you just had that magical feeling like it was somehow reall. You believed a man could fly. Superman Returns fails miserably in capturing that magic.  <br />     This review, however, has nothing to do with the performance of Brandon Routh as the man of steel. He gave a great perfance, despite the big shoes he had to fill. In the end Superman Returns was a giant failure for both Warner Bros. and Bryan Singer who has obviously no love for this Iconic character and even less knowledge of him.

B000G759LW|4.0|Artists make you think you are getting more music when they release double cds. However, both of these discs fit onto a single cd-r with about 1-2 mins to spare.<br /><br />If artists would just fill a normal cd with music instead of making 30-40 minute albums, we wouldnt have things like this.<br /><br />Nice album though, I like the first cd much better than the second

B00005M989|5.0|Okay, Prince's hypersexual image may drive you insane and back. No question it created some Contreversy. But no-one could get down and play dirty, hard-rockin' funk like Prince Rogers Nelson. This is, let us not forget, the man behind I Wanna Be Your Lover, 1999, Little Red Corvette, Let's Go Crazy, When Doves Cry, Purple Rain (his best tune), Kiss, Money Don't Matter 2night and a bunch of others. Purple Rain's also a must-have, so get that and this and party like it's 1999. Or whatever.<br /><br />Little side note: Back in the 80's, the only artists making interesting music were Prince and Stevie Ray Vaughan

He's also trying to take care of an orphan child named Kid ( Charles Korsmo) and romancing his girlfriend Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), there's seems that there's a crime-ring going on thanks to Big Boy Caprice who wants Tracy dead especially a mysterious faceless criminal named The Blank, the seductive night singer Breathless Mahony (Madonna) becomes Big Boy's lover and also falls for Dick Tracy.<br /><br />A brilliant, complicated and unique adaptation of the classic 30's and 40's comic strip with an all-star cast that also includes Kathy Bates, Charles Durning, Charles Flesicher, Mandy Patikin, Marshall Bell, Dick Van Dyke, Catherine O'Hara, and James Caan. The movie actually brings the beloved comic strip to life in a breathtaking and visual way with the cinemaphotography, the set design and atmosphere to make it look like the comic strip especially some of the bad guys's make-up to make them look just like the comic charactersm, the score by Danny Elfman is superb next to his Batman score.<br /><br />Al Pacino was just right for Big Boy Caprice and will quite remenscient of Jack Nicholson's Joker, on Hoffman's Mumbles character he will remind viewers of his Raymond Babbit character from \\"Rain Man\\". Warren Beatty was definitely born to play the role of the title character, in fact he directs this movie as well and i had such a huge crush on Madonna after seeing this movie when i was a young boy. This film was always a childhood fave of mine that i still love even today and is such an underappreciated movie that deserves more attention.<br /><br />The DVD has sharp picture and sound but there's no extras at all not even a trailer, just wish a special edition could be made.

0783240236|4.0|I saw this movie twice before. Once when I was a child and just a few years later as a young teenager. So it was interesting to watch as an adult. I was more into the relationships of the adults. That's intriguing as well as the birds assaults. Still, this movie can capture my attention. <br /> <br />If birds started to attack people, humans would be in big trouble!
B00005LANG|5.0|This new re-mastered version of the classic \\"Exodus\\" by Bob Marley boasts truly improved sonics over the original.  If you like Reggae,  you can't go wrong with this release of the classic Reggae masterpiece. On the other hand,Time magazine called this record \\" the most important LP release of the 20th century.\\" Give me a break.  The writer must have been smoking some pretty good reefer when she wrote that. For a while it was considered ultra-chic for white people to listen to Reggae, hence the hyperbolic Time review of this record.  I'll skip the Reggae \\"deep philosophy\\" and the seriously spaced out and comic book Rastafarian religion ( I mean honestly, these guys claim that the late Ethiopian dictator Haile Selassie, was God, the Creator of the Universe...now, isn't that silly?)  please, and just listen to the music.  And on that level, this is good stuff when the mood is right, and the sound is excellent, tight, bright, good bass, all around a great, maybe even timeless, Reggae record.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I have always loved ghost stories (with great memories of my grandfather telling stories at the campfire when I was a kid) so the premise of this show interest me from the start.  Here is a show that explores the American folk lore and legends that keeps you in chills through each episode.<br /><br />This show is set apart from every show.  I love how the right mood is set with the lighting, directing, and the music.  The visual effects are incredible-with the greatest details. It is horror movie but very tastefully done. The \\"supernatural\\" genre has been butchered (no pun intended) by slasher movies that includes only blood and screams.  \\"Supernatural\\" subtly gives you scares and chills. I remember TV guide, in their preview guide last fall, said to not watch this show without a light on.<br /><br />Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, the two leads, give awesome performances every week.  Playing two brothers, they give life to who these people are and their relationship to each other (and to their dad).  Watching the extras in this DVD set, you recognize the chemistry on the show is based on the chemistry these two actors have as friends in real life.  They are good actors but they are great actors together.<br /><br />Eric Kripke, the creator and producer of the show, described the show in a creative way, \\"it is about two blue collar guys on route 66 entering a horror movie in every episode\\".  I recommend this show-it is movie premiere to see every week.  Don't forget to keep a light on, even though I prefer to watch it without.
1592401791|2.0|Immediately we find problems with orthography and punctuation. \\"Mike\\" (the proper abbreviation of \\"microphone\\" and pronounced so as to rhyme with \\"bike\\") is misspelled throughout as \\"mic\\" (according to the rules of English orthography pronounced so as to rhyme with \\"click\\"). Some sentences end with double question marks. This is not an acceptable way to provide emphasis.    Very soon we find apparent inconsistencies in the narrative. The book begins on the author's first day as the Beatles chief recording when, he tells us, he was nineteen years old. Then we flashback two weeks to when he is offered the position. Here he says he was eighteen. A good editor would have insisted that he stick with one age or the other or else explain that he'd celebrated a birthday in the interim. This, we learn, was in 1966. He had been the Beatles assistant recording engineer since 1962. Arithmetically that should make him either fourteen or fifteen (presumably fourteen going on fifteen). We discover later in nested further flashbacks that he'd taken this earlier job immediately after graduating from high school at fifteen going on sixteen. What happened to the missing year? He doesn't say. Is it common in England to graduate from high school at fifteen? Did he skip two (or three) grades? He doesn't say. (There is nothing in the book or in its plodding and clumsy prose style to suggest that he was particularly precocious.)    The author maintains that in his youth he encountered a \\"UFO\\" which he apparently is convinced was an extra-terrestrial spacecraft. When he told the Beatles about it, John Lennon was dismissive whereas Paul McCartney humored him. If this story is intended, as it seems, to make the reader side with the author against Lennon, all I can say is that it didn't have that effect on me. It had the effect, rather, of damaging the author's credibility. A good editor would have deleted it entirely.    It eventually became clear to me that the author simply doesn't understand Lennon. He can't help that, I suppose, but it irks me to endure his constant dumbing-down of Lennon's ideas and manner of expression in the pretend direct quotations. I've read many Lennon interviews and seen quite a bit of Lennon footage. Whatever else Lennon may have been, he wasn't stupid. I can't account for the author's disparaging of George Harrison and Ringo Starr, but it seems to me mean-spirited. The author's description of Paul McCartney's actual behavior, especially as the book wears on, seems to belie his earlier canonization of McCartney. It strikes me as ironic that McCartney's antics were just those that drove the author to walk off the job during the recording of \\"The White Album\\" and not to return until the recording of \\"Abbey Road\\".    Oh well, there are some interesting anecdotes anyway. Take them cum grano salis, with a grain of salt.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|At a time when several pop/new wave records seemed to have little or no acutal musicianship, \\"Rio\\" showed up. This album has a sense of balance and dynamics that forces the listener to hang in there from beginning to end.  Huge singles like \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" and \\"Save a Prayer\\" fit seamlessly into a record that could have released any one of its tracks as a single.  The production, while more sophisticated than the debut, has a clear rich tone which showcases the real talent this group had. (and still has) <br />Get it in the collection and enjoy a true gem from the 80's.

B000GFLAI0|3.0|I find most of the reviews of this album to be completely over the top.  The third masterpiece in a trilogy?  What is that all about?  When an established artist puts out a new album, I try to listen to it on its own terms.  If someone else, beside Bob Dylan, had put out this album, then how would I rate it?  In that light, this album is a pleasant roots music album with some intriguing lyrics, but not too much more.  To my ears, the edge of this music has been soften too much.  I would take Muddy Waters' version of Rollin' and Tumblin' any time over the version on this album, not that it is all that bad.  Its just average. Working Man's Blues #2 has a great melody and a mix of silly and good lyrics.  However, like most of the songs on this album, the production and arrangements are flat, lacking any drama or tension. There's no grit here.<br /><br />Now, back to that whole trilogy thing. This CD does sound like a follow up to Love and Theft, but a much weaker follow up.  Many of the songs on here sound like the corniest ones on Love and Theft. e.g. Tweedle Dee and Bye and Bye.  Time Out of Mind is one of my favorite Dylan albums and Love and Theft is really good.  Modern Times is pleasant and interesting.  Masterpiece?  No. Fun? yes.  As this CD shows, not everything Dylan does is either great or terrible.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|My kids and I love the show!  It doesn't have a whole lot of content in it that I deem unacceptable to see.  Some of the \\"racier\\" episodes (abortion, peer pressure, drinking underage) can give you a chance for a good heart to heart talk with your own child.  The down to earth town that it depicts is a nice change from some of the other \\"family\\" shows out there.  The scenery is beautiful and the stories are well put together.  I wish they would release the second season asap!
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris, in this well thought out broadside against religion has touched a deep and sensitive nerve in American culture, which, arguably, along with violence, racism, and repressed sexuality, religion makes up the fourth leg of a matrix that defines the substrate of the American way of life. Unlike the others however, and despite a long history of hypocrisy, religion nevertheless is the only one of the four that remains a \\"sacred cow.\\" So Mr. Harris gets three stars for bravery alone.<br /><br />In demonstrating conclusively that the religious Emperor has no clothes (at least no rational ones), Harris unleashes a fuselage at religious mythology, iconography, the illogic and inanity of most of its cannons, its hypocrisy, and most importantly of all, the lack of any discernable positive impact on our collective morality.  And, this is after nearly 3000 years of continuous organized religious teachings and practices.<br /><br />Citing a litany that includes the Crusades, burnings at the stake, the role religion has played in enabling and maintaining slavery, and a Century of Apartheid in both the U.S. and South Africa -- one wonders from Harris' rendition how much better off the world might have been had there been no religion at all.  According to him, religion has even been implicated in enabling and failing to intervene in Hitler's industrialized massacre of European Jews, the Colonialism imposed on most of the Third World, and the ejection of Arabs from the Holy land.<br /><br />Add to this list, the recent religious scandals such as the U.S. Catholic pedophile escapades; the fights over abortion rights; the resistance to new developments in biotechnology and ethics; and the openly condoned hypocrisy of the likes of America's favorite televangelists -- Pat Robinson, Jimmy Baker, Jerry Falwell and Jim Jones.  And then throw into this concoction the very real threat of nuclear war on the South Asian Peninsula between Muslims and Hindu, the new wave of suicidal terrorists, the fourth war in Lebanon, the genocide in Yugoslavia and Sudan, and one is inclined to take seriously Harris' claim that religion remains more a moral scourge than a source of moral enlightenment in the contemporary world.<br /><br />Even today, the oath that one must swear to, as part of the Baptism ceremony in most Christian denominations (Do you believe in the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost?), is the same oath that would have gotten you burned at the stake or beheaded just two centuries ago.<br /><br />Harris' strongest argument however is not just this bleak historical track-record.  It rests also on the fact that the beliefs that define our current worldview are based on outmoded religious and moral ideas two millennia old; were developed by people who knew less about the world they lived in than today's elementary school kids know about theirs.  Yet, it is these 2000-year old anachronistic views that define our moral vision of the World, anchor our contemporary worldview, and still dictate how we 21st Century people think, feel and behave.<br /><br />According to him, most people of the world continue to believe, through their religious teachings, that there is a creator who has written a book containing \\"the infallible words of god\\" and that only THEIR god is the true god; and only THEIR book contains the true and final word - a word by which all \\"right thinking\\" people of the world must live.  They also believe that through faith rather than through historical facts, reason and logic, everything about their god (myths about His life, the content of His books, and their interpretations), must be taken as the infallible gospel truth.  And above all else, they believe that if one lives a life strictly according to \\"the book\\" at worst he will be rewarded in the afterlife (72 virgins, immorality and an everlasting life, a land of milk and honey, etc.).  Many believe that doing so may even postpone or eliminate death altogether, or at the very least, make their journey beyond \\"this life\\" easier. Of course, doing the opposite, of not embracing the \\"correct god\\" is punishable by burning forever in hell, and worse.<br /><br />The problem that Harris spells out for us in this volume is that these competing conceptions of god, and the competing books that are spawn by them, are conceived of in ways that make them mutually incompatible and thus serve to divide us in ways, that so far in our history, have led us to kill each other in brutal ways and on a massive scale.<br /><br />Gods it seems do not suffer competing gods lightly. Yet, despite these deep and important differences across religious faiths, somehow devout people find ways to exclude religious incompatibilities and to excuse religious practices as being responsible for most of the slaughter ravishing the world across vast stretches of history, and including even today.<br /><br />According to Harris. at least within the moderate religious community, there exists an unrealistic modus vivendi: to ignore, yet tolerate other gods and incompatible religious ideas.  The author sees this feigned civility as unrealistic because the truth is that certainty about the meaning of one's own faith makes tolerance of another's impossible.  The religiously inclined generally, and religious moderates in particular, seem to miss the point that self-imposed silence and a refusal to engage in rational discourse about theological differences is a poor excuse for, and is not quite the same thing as, tolerance.  This false tolerance is the kind of passive-aggressive accommodation with outmoded religious ideas that Harris thinks is leading us down the path to a future of even more religious strife.<br /><br />Thus, it could be argued that there is nothing new in \\"The End of Faith\\" that cannot also be found in Bertrand Russell's \\"Why I am not a Christian.\\" It is true that Harris has updated the arguments made by Russell and has added his own philosophical twist, and has put it all together in one tidy easy to read package; and like Russell, he has done so without apologies, and without pulling any politically correct punches.<br /><br />Harris' most telling point is that newer and morally more complex technological times bring with them new moral imperatives.  When this need for a new morality is combined with the meager positive impact of religion compared with its much larger negative impact, the author argues convincingly that there is no longer any reason that can justify acquiescing to or even tolerating archaic, illogical, and rather useless religious ideas that are today's mainstay.<br /><br />This is powerful medicine and paints an ugly but deserving picture of religion as it continues to be practiced. His point that we do so at our own peril must be given a great deal of weight and respect.  However, Harris' message is not as flawless as at first sight it might seem. There are other aspects of \\"The End of Faith,\\" that must be looked at rather more carefully.<br /><br />For instance, because there is so much data supporting his case, it is easy enough for the author to attack the illogic of religion and the reliance on blind faith by its radical elements as the bogeyman of our modern existence. However, it is quite another matter and requires quite a more sophisticated analysis to argue that the moderate and the more nuanced faith practiced by most of the world's religious adherents would have the same or similar devastating effects.<br /><br />Harris asserts that a world of logic and reason (or towards the end of the book a religion of logic and reason), as opposed to one based entirely on blind faith and religious doctrine, would not have the same negative effects and would lead us into a more enlightened, less problematic, more morally evolved, and thus a more civilized world.  But these remain just that, assertions; and even when examined on his own favorite turf, logic and reason, Harris' assertions though plausible are nowhere near overwhelmingly convincing.<br /><br />The difficulty with Harris' argument is two-fold and I believe rather obvious.  A couple of religious reviewers have alluded to one of them.  First, he fails to admit that there is very little at bottom that does not rest on a foundation of faith.  Even with his more logical, and more avowedly scientific approach, it can be safely argued, in the end, that this too is just another \\"faith-based\\" analysis.<br /><br />An equal concern -- whether one's analysis is based solely on \\"religious faith\\" or \\"scientific faith\\" -- is his failure to ask and answer the question about the utility of such faith: to what service is the faith actually being put? I believe this question is prior to that of whether or not the faith is factually based.<br /><br />It seems to me that Mr. Harris stakes his claim on the much easier target: the irrationality of blind faith by religious radicals, the illogic of religious doctrine and the narratives upon which this irrationality and these doctrines are often based - most of which, as he correctly claims are no more believable than most children's fairy tales.<br /><br />Yet, inasmuch as this may all be true, Karen Armstrong, a respected scholar of religious history makes a reasonable, though again not an altogether persuasive case, that it is not just the discrete facts of myths and parables of religious faith, that matter.  She argues quite correctly that man is a symbolizing animal, who demands that his narratives transcend logic in his attempt to organize and then to lend a sense of wholeness to the meanings they impute to the world.<br /><br />At some level, it cannot be easily denied or dismissed that religion is as much about how humans are connected to the larger universe as it is about validly grounded facts.  Thus, recurring religious stories that at times seem childish, always seem to have meanings that transcend and go beyond mere logic and reason. Professor Armstrong's ideas are not just tantalizing, they demand a respect and a hearing in the same market place that suggest that logic and reason are \\"the end all and be all\\" of man's intelligence.  As Godel's Incompleteness Theorem suggests, we may yet discover that logic and reason may not be at the end of our intelligence, but perhaps at its very beginning.<br /><br />There are several other examples in the scientific world that seem to resonate with Armstrong's suggestion: The notion of Symmetry in both mathematics and physics, and the notion of Simultaneity in Particle physics for instance, or the whole world of Quantum Physics, as well as David Bohm's idea of an \\"Implicate Order\\" are just a few very sobering examples of non-religious ideas of wholeness that do not yet fully yield to the logic and reason of discrete facts or even to our best designed scientific experiments.<br /><br />Although my sympathies lie fully in the Harris camp, successfully defeating arguments that take these aspects of religious illogic fully into account is a lot trickier than simply attacking its lack of any discernable factual basis, or demonizing its radical elements.  More to this point, if one reads between the lines even of T.S. Kuhn's The Nature of Scientific Revolutions, we see that many scientific revolutions were in fact equally inspired by dreams, myths and other non-scientific modalities of conceptions --including most importantly religious ideas and myths.  All of these might have been dismissed by Mr. Harris as nonsense or childish.<br /><br />But in the end, let us admit it, all of this philosophical sparring and shadow boxing about religious fact or fiction is mere window dressing for the main event which incredibly and somewhat unconscionably Harris skirts altogether. There is a prior question begging to be asked.  It deals with the issue of what is important about these stories, and myths? About religious books and cannons generally? About religion as a whole?  And of course it gets right down to the bottomline, about GW Bush's faith-based initiatives for instance?<br /><br />Arguably, the answer is this: that religion, whether based on true or false stories, whether manifested as good or evil, whether about the New or Old Testament, the Torah, or the Talmud, is not just morality tales of fact or fiction, only about heaven or hell; but is about an issue Harris neglected altogether: social control.<br /><br />Most religions use their rapidly dwindling moral currency and authority in order to subtlely shape and maintain a particular kind of non-religious social order. Therein lies the rub: and need I say, the true nature of the evil of most religions.  At bottom, our religions, whatever else they may be, are primarily dogmatic secularized ideological instruments of social and political control. They are used to help install and maintain the social and political orthodoxy of the day. They are nothing if not reliable instruments of the status quo, and little more.<br /><br />That is the real reason the religious Emperor has no clothes.  His nakedness has little or nothing at all to do with logic and reason, but everything to do with being a tool and an arm of evil governments.<br /><br />Controlling what and how people think, feel and act is what religions do. That is their basic terrain; it is their primary utility.  That is why in the U.S., most racists are also profoundly religious.  It is why the Taliban worries about the length of women dresses in the West.  It is also why religion is invoked when soldiers go to war; why kids are forced to go to Sunday school, etc. It is also why pseudo-religiosity and pseudo-patriotism go hand-in-hand.<br /><br />Religion trains people to fear the unknown in socially sanctioned, proscribed and permitted ways, and it trains them how to respond to cues in coordinated non-thinking, automatic, and often non-logical (i.e., emotional) lemming-like ways.<br /><br />In the U.S. at least, for the most part religion is nothing but a \\"cash-and-carry\\" secularized ideology of social control, a package of status quo orthodoxy masquerading as a spiritual institution supposedly being driven by higher appeals to other-worldliness and faith.  But of course the proof is in the pudding: No religion within the U.S. would dare be judged only by  its deeds.  Only its propaganda and empty appeals to piety are given full expression. The word in the book is not about doing good, it is about feeling good about oneself for a few hours.<br /><br />The control function of religion alone explains why religion has been impotent morally and why it remains the handmaiden of so much worldly evil.  Small wonder that it should have so little effect on the morality of the nations in which it is practiced.  Control, through a tyrannically imposed morality is its primary purpose and its primary modus operandi. At least the Europeans have gotten smart and have virtually given it up altogether.<br /><br />Except for these minor flaws, this is a very good book. Five stars.
B00009W0U4|3.0|WARNING: SPOILERS. Opening scene is quite shocking.  Some graphic effects.  There is more male nudity and male genitalia than female.  There is only one quick...very quick female genitalia shot near the beginning, or &quot;end&quot; of the movie.  Since the movie begins with the &quot;ending scene&quot; and ends with the &quot;opening scene&quot;.  The rape scene is violent, and intense. Not even a good boob shot.<br /><br />Movie is revenge driven...and that seems to be about it.  Doesn't have a great script...may be good to the French...but, not to US standards.
B00000DCH9|5.0|Well this is certainly not Billy Joel's most commercially successful album, since even many people who claim to be Billy Joel fans have only heard one or two of the songs on it. However, it is my favorite recording of his hands down. Joel recorded it at a time when he was not locked into writing the somewhat uninspired pop-rock tunes you hear on the radio. This was the first rock album I ever bought, and I still enjoy listening to every song except the cheesy love song \\"You're My Home.\\" Of course, Billy's signature song \\"Piano Man\\" resides on track two, but it is hardly the focal point. \\"Travelin Prayer\\" is cool and has some great instrumental work, while \\"Ain't No Crime\\" manages to muster an impressive gospel blues sound from a band of mostly white guys. \\"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\\" is awesomely unique and innovative, and was the song that got me into rock and roll in the first place. \\"Worse Comes to Worst\\" isn't exactly a highlight but it has its moments, and \\"Stop in Nevada\\" is a nice lazy country tune with a good chorus. Joel does some nice vocal work on \\"If I Only Had the Words\\" even though the song is a little boring. I love \\"Somewhere Along the Line;\\" it has a gospel/country feel that really kicks it into gear and leads perfectly into the closer. Last is the greatest Billy Joel song of all, the deservedly infamous \\"Captain Jack.\\" This song contains some of Joel's most chillingly graphic and powerful lyrics, and some very haunting vocals as well. The chorus just rips right through you, especially at the end.
B00005JP8V|4.0|No one knows where the Power came from. In 1692, in the Massachusetts colony of Ipswich, five powerful families steeped in the dark arts form a covenant. One of the families, seeking to gain more power, is exiled. For hundreds of years, nary a trace was found of that banished family - until now. Cut to the present, where the focus is on the Sons of Ipswich, four teenage students, all around 16 and 17 years of age - Caleb, Reid, Tyler, and Pogue - attending the priveleged Spencer Academy.<br /><br />These kids, descendants of the magical families, are gifted with supernatural powers passed on by their ancestry. But the caveat is that the more the addictive powers are used, the more they prematurely age the user. And when they turn 18, they will \\"ascend,\\" thereby increasing their powers a thousandfold. In the past, the overriding temptation to use these powers have often proved to be irresistable to others, at the cost of their lives. Tonight, unbeknownst to the Sons of Ipswich, the bloodline of the long-vanished family returns.<br /><br />At the start of the new school year, an outdoor party is being held. The Sons of Ipswich show up, having dropped off from a cliff. There, they meet the acquaintances of newcomers Sarah Wendham (Laura Ramsey) and Chase Collins (Sebastian Stan), both of whom promptly ingratiate themselves into the group. Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait, from Sky High), the oldest and most level headed of the Ipswich group, and mere days away from his 18th birthday, falls for Sarah, who reciprocates the attraction, to the consternation of Reid, the youngest and most rebellious. Meanwhile, a triangle forms amongst Pogue, new kid Chase, and Pogue's girl and Sarah's roomie Kate (Jessica Lucas).<br /><br />The creepiness begins when that same party produces the dead body of a student, who seemingly died from a drug overdose. That night, Sarah gets the feeling she is being watched in the showers - and she's right. Meanwhile, Caleb suddenly wakes up, sensing that someone has used the Power. The next morning, he's driving his car when a darkling - a manifestation of the dead boy - suddenly appears in the passenger seat, startling the bejeezus out of Caleb and causing him to collide head on with a truck. But Caleb's got the Power, and he survives without a scratch. You've seen the trailer.<br /><br />These unsettling incidents are just harbingers of more sinister events in the offing. It quickly becomes evident to Caleb that a malignant, supernatural force is on the prowl. Related incidents soon give rise to suspicions and jealousies amongst the Sons of Ipswich, threatening to dissolve their close-knit group. In the end, Caleb must summon his powers, even if it prematurely kills him, to save all that he loves against a warlock a thousand times more powerful than he.<br /><br />The trailer doesn't quite lie; this is a fun popcorn flick. The Covenant is reminiscent of The Lost Boys and The Craft in its hip,  horror-laden, teenage sensibilities. However, it improves on those films in the CGI department. The Covenant boasts some pretty cool f/x sequences. While not as inventive as I had hoped, the film does come up with neat ways of showcasing the young warlocks' powers. I only wish that it had an R rating, instead of PG-13. I wanted even darker, more brooding, and more horrific scenes. But that's just the ghoul in me.<br /><br />Starring a bunch of unknown, beautiful kids - but kids that are up and coming - this is a rollicking entry in the action/horror genre. Steven Strait, Taylor Kitsch, and Sebastian Stan stand out, all bringing an earnest and focused screen presence to the flick. Stan, in particular, does his best to chew up the scenery while resembling Jason Priestley more than a bit. Laura Ramsey, well, she doesn't bring in the sexy as much as usher in the cute. The sexy label adheres better to her roommate Jessica Lucas, who is hot, while Steven Strait and Taylor Kitsch (Pogue) seem to have taken over the smouldering look department.<br /><br />No complaints about the production values. This is a good-looking film, saturated in dark, brooding colors and tones, while the bangin' hard rock soundtrack serves to drive the story and lends immediacy to the scenes. With fantastic visuals, a complement of well-meaning young actors, and an interesting supernatural premise, The Covenant also benefits with the insertion of certain themes cloaked under the guise of fantasy horror - notably, the themes of addiction and that sense of immortality and invincibility that you feel when you are young.<br /><br />I quite liked this movie so I hesitate to state the negatives, but you gotta be honest, right? So, here goes. The movie would've been greatly served with a tighter script (how many times have we seen the female lead tell the hero, \\"I'm scared\\" and the hero respond with a \\"Don't be\\"?). There are parts in the middle that seemed to plod and drag on for too long. Like I said before, maybe an R rating would have improved the film, made it more scary. And there isn't enough jeopardy. Maybe, you'll disagree, but I felt there weren't enough victims, leaving the stakes not as high as they should've been. The ending seems a bit rushed and feels abrupt. Frankly, I expected more from the showdown between Caleb and the exiled descendant of Ipswich (by the way, I feel like a numbnut not saying the person's name; it's stupendously obvious, as the film doesn't even really try to camouflage the baddie's identity). And the other Sons of Ipswich could've been showcased more (Tyler was basically non-existent). Anyway, by the end, I didn't get the sense that everything had been resolved. Maybe the powers that be are thinking sequel? I wouldn't mind.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not a great film, merely a decent one, but one which I do recommend. I say it's around three and a half stars. So, what else is there to say? If you have some time to kill, you could do worse than watch this film. Hope this helps make up your mind.ook department.<br /><br />No complaints about the production values.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|My brother and his wife to be walked down the aisle to selections from this soundtrack.  With my being a lover of classical music especially that from movie scores...I was instantly hooked.  Movie scores have always mystified me even in my own life...made me kind of look back differenly at the world moving around me.  I cried at my brother's wedding when his bride to be came out to this music and cried even harder when I sat in the comfort of my office, and then my bedroom while listening to Annie Lennox pour passion and soul into the song \\"into the west\\".  So beautifully written, anyone can find some meaning that touches their life in some personal way...through this beautiful song.
015626224X|5.0|Having read only one of George Orwell's books (\\"1984\\") when I was younger, I'm rediscovering him now, having recently read \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"Down and Out in Paris and London.\\"  Down and Out is a fascinating account of life as a hotel-restaurant worker in the early 2oth century in Paris and London. It's a very graphic account of what is was like to work up to 18 hours a day in brutal conditions and still be poor and hungry. It's also amazing to see the differences between being poor in France and being poor in England. Although I'm no Francophile, it certainly was easier to be poor in France.<br /><br />Orwell is a great writer, and it really shows in Down and Out in Paris and London. His characters are finely drawn, and the reader can almost feel the sweltering heat, the impossible working conditions, and the hunger of an empty belly.<br /><br />I was amazed at the conditions of the poor in England and the system that almost guaranteed that they remained in poverty. France wasn't a lot better, but at least it was a bit easier to be poor in that country.<br /><br />A fascinating look at life in another era.
B000FOQ1EA|5.0|This is a superb set of the Sibelius symphonies, one of the finest I've heard. Blomstedt, famous for his two cycles of Nielsen symphonies, knows the style and character of this music as well as anyone. There is an intensity and seriousness here that suits the music well. The playing of the San Francisco Symphony is excellent throughout, especially the brass. <br />The first two symphonies receive bracing performances that balance the structure with the content of the music very well. The Third ranks with Davis and Jarvi as one of the best on record. The Fourth is a fine performance that captures the brooding atmosphere of the piece, though the finale (with tubular bells) doesn't find the balance of darkness and light that I had hoped. <br />The Fifth is spectacularly good, with tempi and dynamics judged to perfection. The Sixth is rather strange. Consistently slow, it meanders dreamily and misses the joy of the piece. Blomstedt is back on form for the Seventh, which is rugged and positive, making a fitting climax to an altogether wonderful set.
B000HC2LIK|3.0|As another reviewer here on Amazon pointed out, the video quality on this release is an improvement over the previous one, with some notable exceptions. Most of the special effects shots contain HUGE amounts of video noise and/or graininess. I found this so distracting that I couldn't enjoy the wonderful visuals -- especially the awesome opening of the movie. <br /> <br />I feel misled by the \\"professional\\" reviews of this release on DVD sites, which generally praise the transfer and don't mention the above problems. I wish I'd waited until next year's Final Cut, which I'm hoping will clean up the special effects shots.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Perhaps one of the best all around movie out there, animated or not. The chemistry between Donkey and Shrek is hysterical.<br /><br />Donkey the annoying jackass who never shuts up steals the show. His comical quips will leave you in stitches.<br /><br />And when Shrek's swamp is invaded and the dwarves put Snow White on his dinning room table he says, \\"Dead broad off the table.\\" I laughed for days about that.<br /><br />I watched this show time and time again. Everytime I seem to find some new point to laugh at that I didn't get the first time. Full of inuendoes of Americana. Loved it.

B000FL7CAK|5.0|I'm guilty of refusing to watch Veronica Mars while it was airing on television so I can buy the DVD and watch the entire season without the interruption of commercials and waiting a whole week in between each episode.  I have to admit that Season 1 was better than Season 2, but the writing is still smart, witty, and hilarious.  Kristen Bell is an amazing, talented, and funny actress.  Jason Dohring is just as cool, not to mention endearingly hot.  Don't start watching if you don't have the time to go through the whole season because it will pull you in.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|If you want to learn about the movie that created the summer blockbuster phenomenon (I've never understood that, wouldn't it make more sense to release the biggest movies in the winter when people who live away from the equator are trapped indoors and looking for things to do instead of in the summer when it's nice out), make sure you pick up JAWS.  One of Steven Spielberg's earliest films and his first true masterpiece from a directing standpoint and a box office success, this movie is rare masterpiece.  The premise is simple, a great white shark comes into the shallow waters outside the water of Massachusetts, and begins terrorizing people.  The local sheriff (Roy Scheider) works with a local fisherman (Robert Shaw) and a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) to go after the shark who has fatally attacked several people, and the rest is history.  Not a horror film, but much more than a simple drama, JAWS is one of the finest films of the 1970s and one of the best films ever!!<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
6305508550|5.0|Ah, Office Space, one of the greatest comedies of all-time. How can you not laugh at this movie? It insults and exposes the isolation of working in a cubical in some multi-million dollar corporation, with obnoxious co-workers and a boss that overuses the word \\"Yeah\\". The red stapler scene is ALONE worth the price of the enitire movie. Of course, in the end we learn that everything will work out as long as you have that one co-worker who's a stuttering fat guy who can't stand up for himself who torches the entire building so he can get his stapler back.... *sarcasm*. But whatever. What can I say? It's classic humour. If you haven't seen this movie, get off your couch, stop watching that re-run of some WB drama, and rent - no, BUY this movie NOW! You'll never be able to stop watching Office Space. And for the record, this gets my vote for the best comedy of the entire 90s.<br /><br />\\"Oh and we have a HUGE roach problem.... so if you could.... yeah.... just go ahead and take care of that... yeah....\\"
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I love the Star Wars movies. They have proven to be the greatest Sci-fi movies ever and I love them.<br /><br />I own the movies DVD and VHS. I own the 1977 versions on VHS AND the 1997 versions. And trust me, the 1997 version was NOT needed, yet they still proved to be good.<br /><br />Now there's this \\"2004 Special Version\\" that was relesed over a year and a half ago. This is NOT the special edition, IT'S THE EXACT SAME THING AS THE THEATRICAL 1977 VERSION, just with bad CGI effects added in.<br /><br />Lucas, STOP CONTRADICTING YOURSELF. Us fans have already seen the 1977 versions and we don't need another cut. You just want our money, no matter what currency. We already have seen what we need to see.<br /><br />Now, I own 2 VHS sets and 2 DVD sets. I feel I wasted my money on the 2004 Special Editions. Plus, the other DVD set showed the films the way they were meant to be seen: 5.1 Surround Sound, Anamorphic Widescreen, and amped up picture.<br /><br />In Closing: DAMNIT LUCAS, LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE!!!!!!
B000001ED1|5.0|For the last few years, i had heard St. Teresa a hundred times on WNKU local college radio station, and i Never could catch the name of the artist or song..Finally the other day, it came On, but this time by Ritchie Blackmore Knights. The DJ said it was a good remake of Joan Osborne's 95 hit. I never realized it took me 11 years to discover what A Great Singer and writer she was, and im sure Still Is...The Backup band very studio tight as well...One of the More pleasant surprises ive had in a Very Long time...Plus there are 2 cds on \\"Relish\\"...One studio, the other Live..She has One of those Voices that sounds like no one else.   Not one bad tune on the entire cd.
B000002KFJ|5.0|I remember in 1975, being a skinny stoner freak going to ASU.  There was a record store called Rolling Stone (how's that for being original?)down from the dorm on Univesity.  I went in there to get a copy of the new Sabbath LP.  Just walking there, knowing it was waiting for me was enough to cause near panic.  I really loved Sabbath.  I wore out 3 copies of Master of Reality in two years! I read CIRCUS and Rolling Stone Magazine (they really hated BS) to keep up on when the new LP would be out.  And this was it...I picked up the record.  Wow, weird cover.  Looks like some of the band graduated from Stoner to Coker.  Oh well.  I took it up to the register to pay for it.  Some older hippy w/facial hair was working the front.  \\"How's this new Sabbath album selling?\\", I inquired.  \\"Well man, people around here are a little more into music than that\\".  I was too stunned to even say FU.  I stopped at the CHUCKBOX for a brew or two and thought about it.  No A-Hole was going to say that about BS and get away w/it.  I went back to the closet dorm room I called home and threw on the new BS.  Man, this stuff is great! The Hell w/what the moron at the record store said...Hey, wait a minute! I called the record store that night and asked for the manager.  \\"I was in earlier and bought a couple of LPs\\", I told the voice on the other end.  \\"I saw the freak behind the counter put the money in his pocket.  Thought you might want to know\\".  Yep, ya don't screw w/BS fans mufo! Went back the following week for the new Uriah Heep.  Guess what? The facial hair freak had been replaced by a knock-out red head.  Ain't life grand!!!<br /><br />Sabbath rules!
0765348780|5.0|Erickson's characters are both unique and endearing (in their own way). He comes out with a solid debut in Gardens of the Moon and lays the groundwork for what should be a phenomenal series. For those of you who are contemplating reading this book, I strongly urge you to do so just so you can read the second book: Deadhouse Gates, which in my opinion is one of the best epic fantasy novels I've ever read. For me personally, off the top of my head it ranks with 'The Great Hunt' from the Wheel of Time (Which I feel is Jordan at his finest), and any one of the 'Song of Ice and Fire' books from George R.R. Martin.
0767817478|5.0|Main source: \\"Predatory Dinosaurs of the World\\" by <br />Gregory S. Paul. He trained as a pen-and-ink artist <br />a la Audabon, then switched to paleontology. He was <br />one of the prime movers in understanding that many <br />predatory dinosaurs owed more to the leopard than to <br />the man-in-a-rubber-suit. <br /> <br />Granted, some of the \\"person scenes\\" in this Godzilla <br />are like fingernails on the chalkboard. However, some <br />of the human scenes are very good. Jean Reno in particular <br />is excellent in this movie. See Burton's \\"Planet of the Apes\\" <br />for an interesting contrast in responsibility. <br /> <br />CGI? Let me just say that to my (limited) knowledge, this <br />is the only Godzilla movie with underground scenes. And they <br />give me dreams. No man in a rubber suit ever, ever, moved <br />like this Godzilla. I should be so Animal. <br /> <br />And yes, Hank Azaria's character is named Animal, and he has <br />one or two good scenes, and his name is kind of a tag for little <br />kids who may not get the viewpoint of this movie. <br /> <br />Bottom lines: Empathy. I hate to say it, but the Godzilla series <br />was never strong on empathy. This Godzilla allows you relate to <br />the Creature; *if* you want to. <br /> <br />In particular, there is one scene, in a storm, where Godzilla <br />climbs like a leopard up near the top of a skyscraper.  <br /> <br />Lightning is flashing, thunder is rolling. Then the Creature leans  <br />its head back, and does that sky-saw-guitar roar thing. <br />I hope you can relate to the \\"I'm alive\\" thing :-)
B0007XT87G|5.0|Just brief history of this prog fan, I differed from my peers as a kid growing up in the 60's I liked the non-commercial contempory artists, spending hours under the bed cloths listening to the likes of Captain Beef Heart on radio Luxenberg, being blown away by Page,Clapton, Genesis, Yes, to name a few artist's that my hard earn't paper run money helped fund!! Well I found the same excitment all over again with Deadwing, listening to samples on the prog rock archeives to begin with, simply curious about an unusual name. I was just as stunned as when I was a child in the 60's again! The track \\"arriving somewhere but not here\\", sounds as classic and iconic as the best from all those previously mentioned artists, it brought back memories of the pleasure of discovering \\"wish you were hear\\" \\"Lamb lies down on Broadway\\" Led Zep 4 etc. The music could best be described as similar to Pink Floyd, perhaps less commercial, and with no known boring tracks. I found the clean licks of Steve Wilsons guitar very similar to David Gilmour, and the quiet understated vocals with simple harmonys intoxicating. There could be similarities to Steve Hillage, though the songs are very current and will have a more modern atmosphere, also I felt that the music was very carefully crafted with slightly ambiguous lurics that I love, giving an overall impression of being incredibly well produced and engineered. Gavin Harrisons drumming is a revelation in its self, complicated, meticulous and above all interesting. The bass guitar of Colin Edwin providing additional melody lines, rather than just filling out the sound with depth and rhythm complementing the other musicians beautifully. The atmospheric keyboard work of Richard Barbieri I think lends a huge hand in giving the music such a strong colour and vitality, with captivating intensity and charisma. This was the first Porcupine tree CD I bought and it is now one of my favourites of all time, I am learning more and more new things so it seems every time I hear it. I have heard critism that is less favourable than some of the earlier CDs, but I would have to say this Band is heading in a great direction and manage to change and do something different, as in true progressive music. Yes Porcupine Tree are hard to catagorise, they are obviously on a journey which I will follow with great interest, and am trying to drum up interest down here in this part of the world, but if you want to succeed in New Zealand or that little place next door you will have to tour!!! (Please) GO BUY THIS CD!!!!!
B000FP2OPY|4.0|REVISED FOR BLU-RAY RELEASE:<br /><br />THE ORGININAL DVD RELEASE:<br /><br />The best horror show since \\"The X-Files\\" is a witty, clever series which will keep you glued to your seat. Dean and Sam Winchester hunt monsters. After the death of their mother at the hands of a mysterious poltergeist like spirit their father begins a life long obsession with hunting down and destroying the creature that killed his wife. He also hunts other creatures that prey on humanity. When he disappears his son Dean (Jenson Ackles)recruits his brother Sam (Jared Padalecki)to help find their father. In the process they end up hunting supernatural creatures along the way kicking their butts.<br /><br />The actors have terrific on-screen chemistry. I wondered how the show could come up with fresh material given that this show was preceded by the 70's series \\"Kolchak\\" (and before that the superior TV movies), \\"The X-Files\\" and \\"Night Stalker\\" but the producers and writers always manage to come up with fresh angles for the episodes. The show does have occasional cursing (for those that have small kids) and might be too scary for some kids but it's a great show to watch for everyone else.<br /><br />The DVD looks terrific with extras such as commentary (on the pilot and one other episode) as well as deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes featurettes about the actors and the production of the show. Some stores feature additional extras for example Best Buy has an exclusive disc focusing on \\"Supernatural at The Museum of Television & Radio Paley Television Fesvital\\" where the stars, creator/writer Eric Kripke and producers Kim Manners & John Shiban (\\"The X-Files\\") (as well as other producers on the show)discuss the creation, evolution and production of the series. They also answer those burning questions for fans...like why all the 70's rock music (AC/DC and others are featured in the show).  They also discuss the inspiration for the show (\\"The X-Files\\" among them not surprisingly) and changes that occurred from the pitch to production. Don't forget to take a look at the DVD-ROM features which allows you to visit a secret website, see a video of creator Eric Kripke discussing the first draft of the pilot script and where you read/print up the pilot script as well. You can also gain access to the car (and the trunk using a combination code as well for all the weapons beneath the cover).<br /><br />FOR THE BLU-RAY:<br /><br />The Blu-ray has two features that weren't on the original regular DVD edition. The \\"Supernatural at the Museum of Television and Radio\\" featurette has been added to ALL Blu-ray editions (it wasn't only available on certain DVD editions). There's also a \\"Roadmap\\" that takes you to all the of the locations for the first season episodes providing you with information on the legends.<br /><br />Image quality for the Blu-ray is quite strong with nice detail and a sharper more vibrant picture. For the money, it's a good upgrade or first time investment if you haven't seen the show in HD. Be aware that the show is deliberately grainy looking which is the style that the producers chose for the show.

B0007PALZ2|5.0|This movie is one big Bob Marley's Redemption Song, especially the one line in that song that I think goes: \\"we laugh at our genuine prophets and then shed their blood.\\", this movie tells that truth. We make heroes and prophets out of phonies trying to destroy us, while screwing the real prophets for a good laugh. Sure this movie could have had an \\"uplifting\\" ending like the theatrical version of \\"Blade Runner\\" without \\"the vision of the unicorn\\" and James Cole could have gotten the psychiatrist girlfriend and lived happilly ever after. But the message wouldn't have been as clear and it would have had more traditional \\"entertainment value\\". We don't need more of that in this crazy, topsy-turvy world where we DO screw the real prophets and honest heroes with genuine good intentions for a good laugh. \\"We laugh at our genuine prophets and then shed their blood.\\" While sitting in stupefied awe at the real \\"Armies of 12 Monkeys\\" and all that letting them screw over us. So, this is a serious movie with a serious and honest message. And if it had of had an entertainment value ending, it would be just another good \\"entertainment value\\" movie instead of the warning it is.<br /><br />Captain Josh.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This is the best Series, sci-fi series I have ever seen (I cut my teeth on Star Trek).  The characters are rich, the setting is original, each episode is filled with humor and drama.  It has everything one could hope for: spaceships, adventure and cowboys.  After watching the first pilot episode I was hooked.  I am now a true \\"BrownCoat\\" (fan).  Nathan Fillion and Adam Balwin are indeed \\"easy on the eyes\\".
B000002KHH|5.0|Don't believe anyone who tells you that this album is overrated.  Black Sabbath are considered the founding fathers of heavy metal for a reason.  The truth is, no other band was writing anything this heavy back in 1971.  Led Zeppelin are a better band (in my opinion) and definitely influenced heavy music more as a whole, but Tony Iommi's style of riffing, and the band's gloomy, slow and relatively straightfoward style inspired legions of fans and musicians.  Just because there are better albums out there (which there are) doesn't mean that Paranoid isn't a five-star, undisputed classic album well worthy of the recognition it deserves. <br /> <br />Aside from its influence and popularity, Paranoid is a solid album from start to finish.  While being a little on the short side, (42 minutes) it still packs a mighty punch.  Every song here is well-written and strong, with the most popular songs being on the same level as the rest of the album.   <br /> <br />The band sounds very tight, and are able to play together as a single unit.  They jammed together extensively, (which resulted in the basic ideas for most songs on this album) and this gave them practice building off of eachother and shaping powerful, effective songs filled with solos and flair.  Guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward shine most of all, with Tony's charismatic soloing and crushing riffs, and Ward's rhythmic fills and accents.  Of course, Ozzy's voice was as it's most exquisitely whiny and screechy at this point in their career.   <br /> <br />War Pigs - An awesome, powerful opening song.  It's long, filled with both repetition and variation, which combine to make it a memorable, effective song that goes down in history as one of Sabbath's finest.  The lyrics are also very vivid and evocative. <br /> <br />Paranoid - The shortest, most immediate track on the album.  It's catchy and features great instrumentation.  There's nothing to complain about in this song, and it makes up one of the album's most publically popular tracks. <br /> <br />Planet Caravan - A slow, mystical sort of track, with distorted vocal mumblings by Ozzy and improvisational guitar work by Iommi.  A nice segway piece to bring the album into Iron Man. <br /> <br />Iron Man - This is the band's most well-known song of all time, due in large part to its infectious, simple-yet-heavy main riff and melody.  However, aside from its hype and popularity, it's also a well-crafted song in its own right, with all the elements that made War Pigs so successful.  Tony Iommi's melodic, harmonic and rhythmic sense is excellent, as he is the band's main soloist, as well as the backbone for much of the rhythm.  The song has a doomy, infectious quality about it which is irresistible.  It was this song (and others in the same vein) which helped craft the sub-genre of heavy metal known as doom metal--music centralized around a gloomy, almost impossibly slow pulse which packed a mighty punch despite not being as fast or poppy as other rock and roll.  Tony Iommi changes riffs at the drop of a hat, yet still manages to sound fluid...it's a rare and inspiring talent. <br /> <br />Electric Funeral - The songs starts out with an eerie, slow guitar riff reminiscent of Iron Man's.  In comes Ozzy's cynical vocal performance and the song is underway.  In some ways, the song plays off like a lesser Iron Man, but is still appealing in its own right.  As usual, the band changes time signatures and tones several times over the course of the song, inevitably returning to the riff the started it all.  Of all the songs on the album, this is the one which is most likely to get annoying--not a weak track per se, but weaker than others on the album. <br /> <br />Hand of Doom - The song starts out slow and builds to a soaring climax.  It's impossible not to love Bill Ward's rapid-fire, off-beat drum fills in this hallucinogenic drug song.  One of the album's highlights. <br /> <br />Rat Salad - This is a short instrumental track,which, aside from some call riffing and meandered soloing by Iommi, is made up almost entirely of drum soloing and fills.  It's a progressive, jammy song that shows off the band's virtuosity (especially Bill Ward, who is a very competent rock drummer).  It's blusey, improvisational sound reminds me a bit of early Yes or early Santana.  The album wouldn't be the same without this piece. <br /> <br />Fairies Wear Boots - This could be the album's most fluid, cohesive song.  It features the anxious drumming, powerhouse riffage, and strange lyrics which have become Ozzy-era Sabbath's trademarks.  This is probably the bluesiest song on the album, with Ozzy delivering a vocal performance slightly different to others on Paranoid.  The song is a perfect shocase for the band's ability to jam, change tones and rhythms like an attention-deficit-disordered child, and cycle everything back to a central theme.  It's an expertly crafted song, even if the main chorus and tone isn't as bleak or apocalyptic as Iron Man, War Pigs or Hand of Doom. <br /> <br />Overall, a stellar album by a talented band who got just a little bit worse with each release following this one  <br />(with a few exceptions).  Their first six albums are all high quality, but things get a little rough after that.  Kinda like Van Halen.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0060763280|3.0|This book is really just some pretty basic Law of Attraction stuff, and there's an awful lot of plugging for the author's seminars. I feel like he's just about to tell me something I really want to know, and then...he says, \\"if you come to one of my seminars, we'll be able to show you just how this works.\\"  Not really worth my ten bucks.  I'd rather have watched \\"The Secret\\" online two more times.  Eker is not that inspiring an individual.  Although, he IS rich. :)
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|As a stand alone movie, it works well. The look, pacing and acting all are very good and show definite quality. That being said, this is probably the most offensive adaptation of any Alan Moore story yet. Yes, it's worse than League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. The Wachowskis and McTeigue nailed the look, but blew the script. While I cannot go into specifics (as they would be major spoilers), suffice it to say, they didn't \\"get\\" the story Moore wrote. Moore's story dealt with a grey world full of ambiguity and people with good intentions being felled by their own weakness. This is a superhero vs. Hitler. There is no ambiguity. One side is clearly good and the other is clearly evil. Not only that, but there are several scenes that are totally ludicrous in the context of the story (not to spoil anything, but what kind of totalitarian regime cannot even control the state-run media?). Read the book instead, you'll get more out of it and hopefully prevent garbage like the movie from being made. <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|Make that NO stars!<br /><br />Moore and this movie are too ridiculous to take seriously. But notice the adoring responce of the Democrats--embracing this slob and plopping him next to the equally vile Jimmy Carter at their convention--compared to the hissy fit they're throwing on behalf of the sociopath, Boy Clinton, over ABC's docu-drama, Path to 9-11. Stunning hypocrisy!<br /><br />If they'd devoted as much energy to getting bin Laden and protecting this country from Islamo fascist terrorism when they had the chance (and were entrusted with the nation's security!), 9-11 may have been prevented, and we'd all be in a much stronger position today.<br /><br />The Stalinist left--Lotion Boys for the Jihadists--demonstrates its disdain and hatred of American at every turn.

B000H7JD4K|5.0|Maiden continues on their progressive path in songwriting.  This CD is filled with epic pieces that spike emotion. Every band on the face of the planet should take note from Maiden on the correct way to progress into longevity.  There's a reason Maiden has been around for 30 years.  This is not a band for casual listeners. The classic albums are great, but everything from Brave New World on teaches a lesson in creativity.  The sound on AMOLAD is crisp and clear and extremly refreshing.  Well done, guys.  The irons remain up.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|This album is the rebirth of  Maiden! When their last album, \\"Dance of Death\\", came out, I tried very hard to let the album grow on me... but it never did. All I was left with after every listen was the same feeling I got in the late Eighties when \\"Fear of the Dark\\" came out... mainly, that it was the decline of Maiden. With the muddy-sounding mix and the tired-sounding songs, \\"Dance of Death\\" was a low point. With \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\", Iron Maiden has once again climbed atop the metal mountain... this is a collection of heavy, Kick a** songs with 6 great songs, and 4 good ones; a great album all the way through. The mix is perfect, with Steve and Nicko in the front, the songs rock, the solos soar, and Bruce sounds as powerful as ever. This album is on par with \\"Brave New World\\" (a modern classic). I thought Maiden was through, but when I heard this album, I knew it was \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" that I see this tour live... See you in the Pit at Irvine! Up the Irons! Best Songs= Different World, Brighter than a Thousand Suns, The Longest Day, Out of the Shadows, and The Reincarnation of Ben Breeg.(And if you're hungry for more metal, check out any of Bruce's solo cd's with Roy Z... especially \\"Chemical Wedding\\").

No melody. Killers wouldn't know a good tune if it bit them in their collective arses.
B000GTLQXU|2.0|it just didn't live up to the original made in 1972.  The special effects were better, but you had no real feel for the characters.

B00005JP81|5.0|Ryan Fleck's \\"Half Nelson\\" is a film that stands staunchly for the principles of civilization and political empowerment, even as it demonstrates in microcosm just how compromised those principles can become. It is a film that never tells you what to think about the story or the characters, while at the same time demanding that you DO think about them, deeply. This alone is audacious for any American film. The superb, slice-of-life screenplay by Fleck and editor/producer Anna Boden presents Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling), a history teacher in an inner-city middle school who tries to fill his mostly apathetic students with the leftist zeal he learned from his parents. Unfortunately, Dunne is the living embodiment of the old saying, \\"The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\\" His life is sliding downhill, thanks to a raging crack habit.  Nevertheless, he manages to keep his addiction out of the classroom until the day that Drey (Shareeka Epps), his brightest and most admiring pupil, catches him hiding in a toilet stall with his crack pipe. Drey is already an embattled soul; her brother is in jail for drug dealing, and Frank (Anthony Mackie), the neighborhood kingpin, is supporting Drey's family in exchange for her brother taking the fall for him. But this support has strings attached; Frank expects Drey to come into business with him. The brilliance of \\"Half Nelson\\" is in depicting Dunne and Frank's battle for Drey's soul, as Dunne slowly but surely loses whatever moral authority he possesses. Frank, the representative of urban decay and criminal evil, is a stronger personality than Dunne, and outwardly a more stand-up guy. (The big confrontation scene between the two is deeply sad and ironic.) The story plays out in ways that are fresh and surprising, yet always completely logical given the characters, and the end, though not the gift-wrapped resolution American audiences expect, offers a fragile ray of hope for both Dunne and Drey. A large part of the film's impact comes from the performances of the ensemble cast,which could not possibly be more natural, real, or compelling. Gosling, in particular, nails the contradictions of his character's personality, making the dichotomy between his idealism and his moral turpitude all too believable. Andrij Parekh's jittery, documentary-style camera adds to the you-are-there reality of the film. \\"Half Nelson\\" is not an easy movie, or one to see in an escapist mood.

0722532938|3.0|This is a nice little book.  It flows well, has an upbeat, positive message and a modicum of exotica is sprinkled throughout the text.   <br /> <br />However, it is an unusually spare and simplistic in it's construction.  The characters are at best one dimensional, the dialog is minimalist in the extreme and the overall construction can only be described as basic.  To be honest, I'm surprised this book has made it big as adult fare--it reads much more like the kind of book I'd give to a 6th grader.  The language, the plot--to the extent the book can claim to have a plot--the whole package has the complexity of a pre-teen motivational book.  A very good pre-teen motivational book, but a pre-teen motivational boon nonetheless. <br /> <br />Personally, I expect a higher level of complexity, sophistication and intellectual challenge from my novels.  I have no quarrel with the message--I just wish it had been packaged in a way that provided some real sense of conviction and, ultimately, reading satisfaction. <br /> <br />I in fact did give this to my 6th grade mentoree at my church this summer and she loved it.  So, my advice is if you buy this book, give it to one of your kids.  It's the best move for both of you. <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|It would be wrong to say that this marks a return to the days of Ten and Vs. for Pearl Jam. The style of this new, extraordinary album is by no means similar to those classics, but instead, it presents a new style and unfamiliar sound that is equally engaging. It does not reflect the same influences as their more experimental and less mainstream period either, although it seems to draw inspiration from both.  <br /> <br />The self-titled Pearl Jam follows the mold of a classic punk rock album, but one can still sense that there is an evident progression from the anger and darkness of Vs. to the more reflective and comtemplative themes of the self-titled. While Ten and Vs. seemed to be crying out with rage, Pearl Jam has faced a life wasted at this point. A major difference between this album and some of the previous ones is the driving guitar that had occasionally been lacking is back in a big way. Songs like \\"World Wide Suicide\\" and \\"Life Wasted\\" jog the memory of old Pearl Jam classics, but still present a new feel.  <br /> <br />Yet the album is preciously balanced between solid rock songs and slower, more comtemplative tracks. \\"Unemployable\\" is a personal favorite, as it explores the hardships of a life at the mercy of others. And this in itself is truly a reflection of why Pearl Jam is one of the greatest rock bands of their time; their music, whether heavy, soft, mainstream, or experimental, has never been self-indulgent and continues to intrest, insight, and inspire listener. As Eddie Vedder shamelessly admits on \\"Umemployable\\", \\"I've seen the light.\\" Well, so have I.
B000G759LW|3.0|I have to give credit to pop princess Christina Aguilera for the audacious career move she has made in releasing a two-disc set full of such relatively eclectic music at a time when the music industry is turning its back on the format. True, she is vocally more talented than Britney, Jessica and the rest of her helium-filled sorority, but she isn't as versatile as she or her handlers would want us to believe. That's not to say she will not achieve that level someday, but at the ripe old age of 25, Aguilera lacks the interpretative skills of any of the veteran singers she is trying to mimic here from Lady Day and Aretha down to Whitney and Mariah. She is still a singer who feels more comfortable showing off her gymnastic melisma than a sense of nuance and maturity.<br /><br />The first disc, however, is a solid showcase for her very specific talent thanks to the street-savvy production work of Gang Starr's DJ Premier. By far, the best song on the whole set is the highly charged lead-off single, \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", with its James Brown-inspired horn riffs, girl-group sass and the most infectious hooks of the summer. It sounds like prime Whitney with a welcome gutsy edge. \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\" is a sturdy soul shouter for Aguilera, benefiting from Steve Winwood's familiar Farisa organ which makes the song sound like a Spencer Davis Group outtake. The fifties-style doo-wop of \\"Understand\\" (with a great sampling of soul diva Betty Harris), the loping Quincy Jones-style of \\"F.U.S.S.\\", and the breezy, Stevie Wonder-lite \\"Without You\\" are all catchy in their radio-friendly ways. The disc unfortunately ends with too much self-aggrandizement with her overly defensive \\"Here to Stay\\" and her blowing air-kisses to fans on the egotistical \\"Thank You\\".<br /><br />While the first disc benefits from its relative consistency, the second disc suffers from its abundance of pretension. Produced by Linda Perry, Aguilera's songwriting partner on \\"Beautiful\\", it starts with an overly moody Cirque de Soleil-style downer, \\"Enter the Circus\\"; rebounds somewhat with the power ballad \\"Welcome\\" but then gets stuck in WWII-era pastiche with Aguilera's Andrews Sisters impersonation on \\"Candyman\\", a note-for-note rip-off of \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B\\". The chanteuse cheekiness on \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" works for the most part, but the muffled scratchiness of \\"I Got Trouble\\" doesn't really help her get closer to the hard-earned melancholy of Bessie Smith. Self-indulgence is a major problem throughout as she seems to be channeling Streisand on \\"Hurt\\", Billie Holiday on \\"Mercy on Me\\" and an unlikely combination of Blossom Dearie and Fiona Apple on \\"Save Me from Myself\\". The last track, \\"The Right Man\\", is one melodramatic wedding song, but she actually handles it with aplomb.<br /><br />It's a bold experiment for Aguilera that shows off her burgeoning talent, but it's premature for her to tackle the variety of vocal stylings she tries to display here. If she waited a decade or just released the first disc by itself (without the last two tracks), I think she would have come across as far more impressive and far less precocious.eil-style downer, \\"Enter the Circus\\"; rebounds somewhat with the power ballad \\"Welcome\\" but then gets stuck in WWII-era pastiche with Aguilera's Andrews Sisters impersonation on \\"Candyman\\", a note-for-note rip-off of \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B\\".

B000244FDW|2.0|I'll start with the good stuff:  Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins.  Wonderful comic performances by the actors, creating humans, not cartoon characters. Difficult to do with these roles!  Several other supporting actors are good as well.<br /><br />But Lizzy.  Oh my.  She's terrible.  There's no wit, no sparkle, no chemistry with Darcy.  She competently pronounces her lines, but with little variation regardless of the context, or seeming understanding of the novel's subtext.  Darcy is a little better, but without a compelling Lizzy it hardly matters.<br /><br />The script and direction are truly poorly paced.  Important scenes are rushed over, and unimportant scenes drag on and on.  At times, additional dialogue not from the novel is thrown in for no apparent purpose other than to slow down a scene.<br /><br />The production values are typical 1980-ish British Television, so there's nothing visually arresting to distract you from the painfully tedious proceedings.<br /><br />I've enjoyed, in one way or another, every other adaptation of P&P I've seen.  But this one was a drag.

B000GCFO0S|5.0|First with regard to Blu-Ray, I suspect the above reviewer was using an inferior television.  The picture was sharp and superb almost to the point of distraction sometimes, but I suppose that's the point of using Blu-Ray. <br /> <br />As for the movie, when I saw it had Radha Mitchell (from Pitch Black) and Sean Bean I knew that this would not be a standard shocker, and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />The movie throws subtle clues about what's going on to accumulate and fall together at the end for a touching and rewarding 'wow'.  This movie stuck with me through the night after I watched it and put all the pieces together neatly with appreciation for the writing as well as the directing and acting. <br /> <br />I'm extremely pleased I waited for this movie to come out on blu-ray before I saw it, too.
B000051YEG|5.0|Serge Gainsbourg, will (in most peoples eyes), be the dirty little Frenchman, that seduced English rose \\"Jane Birkin\\", and mostly recorded his sleazy endeavour on the \\"Je T'Aime...Moi Non Plus\\" track.  But dig past those initial reservations, and you'll find that he was a composer of some seriously good Cabaret / French Pop / White-funk /  Jazz-Pop /  Baroque-pop, and although his music reminded something of a cult concern, his music generally deserved a much wider audience.  And with this album (considered to be his strongest album), he somehow nailed a consistency throughout the record, that his other records, weren't quite able to match. (admittedly it only contains 7 tracks), but contained here, are some of Serge's strongest compositions.  For further evidence of this, investigate the staggeringly beautiful 7 minutes that make up \\"Melody\\", a track that brings together sharp string sections, coupled with tightly rhythmic guitar, and a decidedly carefree (almost organically French) sound, that is more the music to a wonderfully moody Cinematic film, than anything to do with flimsy euro-pop, and such is the brilliance of this track, that \\"David Holmes\\" would go on to cover this track, for his \\"Lets Get Killed\\" album (The track is renamed \\"Don't die Just yet\\"), which is a virtual replica of Serge's version (save for small snatches of drum beats added to the mix, and a slightly more prominent string arrangement).  And almost as if to prove that this was no one off idea, he brings out the seriously funk-driven groove of \\"En Melody\\", a track that seemingly has Serge comprising a track that is unquestionably acomplished stab at white-funk, and it's a staggeringly brilliant effort, that if it wasn't for the cheeky passionate organism sounds peppered through the latter half of the album, most people would have been perfectly within reason to think that this was the work of some obscure, incredibly talented black, funk band.  And the remaining tracks \\"Ballade de Melody Nelson\\",  \\"Valse de Melody\\",  \\"Ah! Melody\\", \\"L' Hotel Paticulier\\" & \\"Cargo Culte\\" all flit between a sublime blend of kitsch and gimmick-esque tunes, yet remain outrageously brilliant, intoxicating amalgams of jazz and pop styles, that not only tackle bohemian jazz to rock and even synth funk with a style and eccentric wit, that become a calling card of Serge's music, and possibly one of the biggest reasons for his appeal. <br /> <br />This album is arguably the most consistent and cohesive of Serge's albums, and although running at a fairly brief 27 minutes, it's a fascinating record, one that is by turns funky, humorous, Hedonistic and Sensual, and has a such a tongue in cheek, carefree swagger about it, that you can't fail by be impressed by the sheer audacity of it all.  Those that had (like me) only really know Serge's work via his hit single \\"Je T'Aime...Moi Non Plus\\", would do well to give this a whirl.  It really highlights how overlooked his work really was, and that most people initially had him pegged as a dirty old Frenchman, who got lucky with a saucy single.  It's shamelessly overblown, impossibly cheeky, beautifully arranged, and impeccably performed...and most importantly it's a lot of fun to listen to.  Those buyers looking for the hits (or the nearest his songs became to be popular), would be well advised seeking out one of the many compilations bearing his name, but those that are interested in hearing what the pinnacle of his work sounded like, simply must check out this funky little gem.  Recommended!!! <br />
B000GIWS7E|4.0|If you're a DT fan, buy this. You won't regret it. <br /> <br />Overall, I love this DVD and I'm glad I bought it, but if I had to make one complaint... <br /> <br />Oh, I should also add that I'm only referring to the PCM stero version since I don't have a 5.1 surround setup. <br /> <br />As is often the case with previous DT releases (I&W and SFAM, most infamously), poor Johnny Myung's wonderful bass is lost in the mix. This is most notable on the first track, The Root of All Evil, where I could barely hear it at all and initially thought there was something wrong with my subwoofer. From then on the bass gets better, but compared to the way it was captured on Live at Budokan, its rather muddy and rumbly, instead of thick and deep as it should sound. <br /> <br />Other than my complaint about the bass, the quality of Score's PCM stereo mix is a vast improvement on Budokan's. John P's guitar is nice and loud here, despite what some other reviews may say about not being able to hear him. In fact, the PCM mix as a whole is nice and loud, again, as opposed to Budokan. Oh, yeah, the Orchestra, they are captured well too, but DT is given more presence when they are playing together, and thankfully, and wisely, the orchestra comes in only when needed...they don't just try to underscore every note. Another great thing about this mix is that there's no buzz-killing dynamic range compression like there was on Budokan: there's nothing more upsetting than expecting the song to get lounder at a certain point and instead hearing it get quieter. This time around, when the whole band kicks in, it gets louder! And when its supposed to be a quieter part of the song, it gets softer. <br /> <br />Oh, also, also also... James Labrie doesn't suck on this one!!! Those of you who have heard enough live DT recordings know that JLB kinda sucks live...or so we thought. Not only is he not straining or sounding winded while singing, but he's actually doing a good job. He sounds more in controlof his voice and he's hitting all the right (read: challenging) notes. And yes, he even belts that scream at the end of Octavariam, which is a truly spine-tingling moment (I wanted to cry and say 'You did it James! I always believed in you!) <br /> <br />Oh, and no offense to the Japanese audience (ala Bukokan), whom I know are naturally more reserved, but its great to hear some real crowd reaction at Radio City and get the impression they're actually really into the music (as evidenced by all the stiff white dudes nodding their heads up and down, no question it's a prog crowd...and I can say that cause I'm one of them and proud of it) <br /> <br />And I'll end with some notables: <br /> <br />-Jordan Rudess playing that continuum thing (kinda reminds me of Keith Emerson and his 'synthesizer on a stick', except that Jordan didn't try to rub the thing between his legs like Emerson did) <br /> <br />-the 'sea of lights' and sing-a-long during The Spirit Carries On <br /> <br />-Jordan Rudess playing the pedal steel on the beginning of Octavarium, (but it makes you wonder \\"who's playing that atmospheric keyboard chord then?\\") <br /> <br />-John reaching over and plucking the other John's strings (it looks cooler than it sounds) <br /> <br />-John P looking beefed up like he's trying out for the World's Strongest Man Competition <br /> <br />-A guy from the orchestra making devil horns
B000FGGE68|4.0|I lost track of how many times I found myself thinking a scene from this movie reminded me of other films [Aeon Flux, Matrix, Kill Bill, Resident Evil, ETC].  Even the young boy in this picture [Cameron Bright] plays a role shockingly similar to the one he plays in the third X-Men movie.  Inaddition to the similarities to other action romps, some of the sequences in this futuristic shoot-em up look like bad effects from TV's Power Rangers.  The jerky camera work and impossible stunts are not always very believable or likable.  That being said, Ultra Violet can be a lot of fun if you watch it with the same vein you might watch an old martial arts film.  It's not a cinematic beauty and Milla Jovovich has done better stuff than this, but it actually is better paced than the afore mentioned Aeon Flux.  The extras do not add much to the overall effect and the scene selection menu is rather flawed [it's easier to just start the movie and skip to the scene you want than to try and get the exact scene using the menu].  In the end, I enjoyed this DVD more than I thought I would and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind mindless action once in a while.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack is AWESOME , because: <br /> <br />a. You can listen to it all the way through, and go, \\"Oh, now Elisabeth is doing so-and-so,\\" and stuff like that. It's great to be able to know where you are in the movie. <br /> <br />b. This music isn't flat, it has feelings, and it's got a wide range of feelings, like: sadness, peace, anger, excitement, confusion, overwhelming happiness, and a sense of \\"whatever happens, Jack's got it under control.\\" I think that any music that can play with your feelings like that definitely can be called good music.  <br /> <br />My advice? Your life is not complete unless you hear this!
B0002OERI0|1.0|This piece of s*** band. Thinks they're so cool because they think they know everything about Iraq and the war on terrorism. Well Tell you somethin punks. I AM AN AMERICAN SOLDIER and I am fighting to protect you and your gay rights. First of all in the song American Idiot there is a line that says <br /> <br />Don't want to be an American Idiot <br />A Nation Controlled By The Media <br /> <br />Well guess what these guys are. You think that you are stickin it to the man by listening to this stuff no this is part of the MTV Music Video driven society that has completelely destroyed what we used to know as music. <br /> <br />And then these guys have the audacity to bash BUSH (who is doing a fine job believe me) because they watch the six o'clock (excuse me 1800) news. Well let me tell you somethin you should all drop to your knees and thank god that you live here and not in Iraq under Sadam. <br /> <br />BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THAT WAS LIKE? DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD DO TO YOU IF YOU WERE TO SAY SADAM IS BAD OVER THERE? YOUR TRIAL WOULD CONSIST OF YOU BEING DRIVEN OUT INTO THE DESERT THEY TELL YOU WHAT YOU DID WRONG AND THEN THEY WOULD BLOW YOU UP! THAT'S RIGHT NO JURY NO JUDGE NO CHAIR JUST BYE BOOM! <br /> <br />And then they say they support our troops. How can you support troops but not the war. What do you want us to do sit around and waste your tax money. These guys are superfluous. They constantly contradict themselves. <br /> <br />Let me tell you a thing or two about Iraq. Things are going great over there you can trust me on that. We Haven't even hit 3,000 deaths yet and we are well into the third year while their the terrorist death toll is four-times higher. <br /> <br />And then Bush's approval ratings 31% I DONT THINK SO. First of all they say its random and it is but in certain areas were liberal voters tend to live and second of all they are not all registered voters I guarantee. <br /> <br />Billy Joe Thornton Can Go To H*** for all I care. This band sucks they sound like DOOKIE.

0060837020|3.0|Actually 3.5 stars. Certainly a disturbing piece of work and written is such a way that it would be easy to confuse this as an autobiographical work. The description of the descent into mental illness is so vivid that the readers might question their own mental health. Powerfully written and moving. <br /> <br />My only fault with the book was towards the end. While Ms. Plath goes into depth with the descent into mental illness, the reverse is not true. The protagonist's climb to mental health is not documented at all. I would go into detail for this review, but that would involve spoilers. But, it affected me enough that I cannot give the book the full number of stars I would have intended. <br />
B000FA57RG|5.0|i know what you're thinking.  madonna's a great performer, but how does that transfer onto a live cd?  i thought the same thing.  until i got this.  it's excellent.  the sound quality is great, her vocals are impressive, it's a nice collection of songs.  and of course, the documentary is phenomenal.  this lady will outlive us all.

B0000633LR|5.0|Based on Slyvia Nasar's book; this movie is about John Nash a brilliant mathemitician and code breaker  who in turn suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. In real life John Nash only heard voices and did not see things. He starts at Princeton, where he is accepted into graduate school and where his schizophenria beginngs. He has a roomate played by Paul Bettany and his own close group of friends. He is befrinded by Alicia NAsh one of his students played well by Jennifer Connelly. They marry and throughout their marriage they are  plagued by his continued delusions and hallucinations. His wife knows there's something wrong but will do anything to save her marriage and tries very hard. Ed Harris playes the imaginary government conspirator who leads John to believe his is part of a conspiracy and Paul Bettany playes the imaginary roomate. John Nash is gets so involved with his delusions that it starts to effect his marriage and his life especially after his first son is born. Christopher Plummer plays the psychitrist who tries to help him and does by hospitilation. This is a very emotional movie for anyone that has dealth with schizophrenia. I highly recommend it you will not be disappointed. Ron Howard did a brilliant job directing this movie.
6305090564|4.0|Okay how many scary pictures are funny? The better ones actually. Think about it, \\"Scary Movie\\", \\"The Mummy\\", \\"Tremors\\", and \\"Army of Darkness\\". Scary and funny mix nicely. This is entertaining because it has a decent mix of scary and funny. I think Stephen Sommers did a decent job directing on this one. The cast is great and the special effects aren't bad. So all-in-all it has most of what the previous movies I mentioned have. Maybe not quite as good as them, but certainly not bad at all. I recommend you catch this one if you like the movies I mentioned.<br /><br />The plot of modern day sea pirates hi-jacking a luxury cruise liner is rather interesting as this actually has happened. More so today than when the movie was made, but currently sea pirates are actually becoming a real problem again. In this stories case the pirates find a empty ship, well except for a few hungry sea monsters. Far-fetched? You bet, and I like it. Some critic accusing Sommers of not having original ideas is just plain lame. I haven't seen anything like this before myself, and even if I had I would still say he did a good job.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|I don't like giving away five stars but this material totally deserves it. This is what music is all about.

B000001E18|4.0|U2's 'Zooropa' is a bit of a let-down after their magnificent 'Achtung Baby'.  It is a brave, new effort that goes into more of a \\"space age\\" feel, adding to the technology of its predecessor.  The subject matter is more bleak, not unlike a series of depressed creations by \\"Major Tom\\".  It seems to look at the state of affairs, like usual; only this time Bosnia and technology seem to have staved off the party atmosphere of 'Achtung...'.  Significantly, that one was done after the fall of the Berlin Wall.  'Zooropa' soberly assesses the world after communism's collapse. <br /> <br />The title track is the most space age song they've done.  The lyrics evoke alienation in the starkest form.  If \\"Zoo Station\\" was the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" of U2's career, then this is the \\"Space Oddity\\".  \\"Numb\\" furthers the alienation with an industrial mix and the Edge's monotone rap delivery.  \\"Lemon\\" seems to disco-tize the music, making it sound like a space station lounge.  The lyrics reek of despair, but also contain hope with lines such as \\"Midnight is where the day begins\\".  (Perhaps mixing their senses like English poet, John Keats, they liltingly give mantras to stave off the desperation of \\"holding onto heaven too tight.\\"  They also seem to draw from Dante where the pilgrim and Virgil reach their destination out of hell at midnight, making Purgatory, a place and time.)  Melancholy fills the air with the aching longing of the love song \\"Stay (Faraway So Close!)\\".  With the Edge's simple, British invasion guitar licks and Bono singing lines like \\"Dressed up like a car crash/ Your wheels are turning, but you're upside down.\\"  It is also a serenade that would go well with a movie like \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" with lines like \\"Stay!  With the demons you drown...Stay!  With the spirit I've found...\\"  If the first half seems bleak, then the second half goes to further depths.  \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car\\" takes a sublime and desperate look at the contingencies of life.  \\"Some Days Are Better Than Others\\" is sarcastic, but entertaining in its acceptance that some things just happen in life.  Both \\"Babyface\\" and \\"Some Days..\\" are upbeat,  yet contain able phrasing for such mundane subject matter.  They also reflect their desperate moments, not as poignantly as on 'The Joshua Tree,' but the despair reaped on \\"The First Time\\" and \\"Dirty Day\\" are almost frightening.  If the loneliness and desperation weren't enough, U2 finishes the album with Johnny Cash, singing ably a science fiction nightmare with \\"The Wanderer\\".  It is a vision of love gone wrong in a landscape of nuclear and environmental proportions.   <br /> <br />Perhaps 'Zooropa' alienated some fans.  It is not a happy sojourn after the brilliant 'Achtung...,' but it is a brave, unflinching ensemble that can help people work through depression and their worst fears of the future.  'Zooropa' was a bleak, but brave step for U2.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|T. S Eliot wrote that \\"Good poets borrow, great poets steal.\\"  First of all, Dylan should have given Muddy Waters create as the composer of Rollin' and Tumblin' recorded by Waters in 1947.  Dylan did alter the words to some degree, but the entire song and the opening words are Muddy's.  What is so difficult giving credit for authorship when and where it's due.  Dylan also takes the title from a great Carl Perkins' song, \\"Get Your Cat Clothes On,\\" changes the word sequence to \\"Get on your cat clothes\\" and appropriates the line as his own.  Does Dylan even have a notion about what getting your cat clothes on means?  I doubt it, especially since Dylan now sports rhinestone cowboy hand-me-downs.  On \\"Working Man's Blues #2\\" Dylan could have acknowledged Merle Haggard, who wrote and sang the far-better orginal \\"Working Man's Blues.\\"<br /><br />I wonder if any of the reviewers actually listened to this cd.  \\"Beyond the Horizon\\" would have jumped out at them as a note for note copy of \\"Red Sails in The Sunset, a hit record for the Platters in the late 1950's, as well as for numerous other artists. It is what is called a \\"standard,\\" an oft-recorded song that became a best-seller for various musicians.<br /><br />That's it from the complaint department.  I strongly feel that  musicians and artists need to be recognized for their work.  Dylan chooses not to. It affects the integrity of listening to the cd. I'll take a star off for that.<br /><br />That said, there is some great music here.  \\"Thunder On The Mountain\\" is worth the price of the cd if you buy it used.  Good song, but what Dylan often gets into is reaching for the rhyme at the risk of making sense and having continuity.  Sometimes it works and makes quirky sense. Sometimes it doesn't. \\"Spirit on the Water\\" is worth the price of the cd if you bought it new.  There is beauty, sensitivity with a human voice not reaching for clever rhymes but reaching for the intimate truth.<br /><br />The musicians here are terrific.  I listen to this cd often.  It has a quality to grab and hold.  Sorry to be bugged by the lack of credit given to Muddy Waters and Carl Perkins, and whoever wrote \\"Red Sails In The Sunset.\\"  Dead artists deserve better than someone reworking their words and music and taking credit for authorship, even if that someone is a genius and living legend.  I give this cd four stars.  Dylan is going to have to give credit where credit is due to get that fifth star, not that it matters to him.are terrific.  I listen to this cd often.

B000HBK3MM|4.0|Soul music is probably the easiest sound to replicate.  Every genre from country, to hip-hop, to jazz, to blues can pull elements of soul into it.  That's probably why it's the hardest category to break when it comes to success on the chart.  Usually it's the artists that get down deep into their own souls who have the most success when it comes to album sales.  Think about it.  The best albums from your favorite soul artists are usually the ones that you can either relate to yourself or that you felt was their most compelling when it came to stories they told.  Both of those things bring out the true essence of soul music.  That's probably why Corinne Bailey Rae has gotten so much buzz as of late because you can put on her self-titled album and your almost instantaneously engulfed in her world.<br /><br />\\"Like A Star\\" is a great choice to start off the album with considering the uncomplicated lyrics and the tranquility that she shows on the song.  It leads right into the serene nature of \\"Enchantment\\" but then she changes gears with the self-liberating debut single \\"Put Your Records On.\\"  \\"Til It Happens To You\\" will remind you of the bluesy sound of a Norah Jones, along with the moody \\"Trouble Sleeping.\\"  \\"Call Me When You Get This\\" is a ambient yet funky groove that is worthy of being another radio single.  Corinne belts out a couple heartfelt ballads over the smooth tune \\"Choux Pastry Heart\\" and the harmonious track \\"Breathless.\\"  She closes out the album with the upbeat, jazz-inspired \\"I'd Like To,\\" the heartening nature of \\"Butterfly\\" and the leisurely mood of \\"Seasons Change.\\"<br /><br />Although the album only clocks in at just over 45 minutes, Corinne gives you more than enough to enjoy.  It remains to be seen if the world will truly embrace Corinne Bailey Rae, but after one listen you'll agree that she is definitely a force to be reckoned with.  Do yourself a favor and grab Corinne Bailey Rae for a truly organic experience.

B000F3AAUW|4.0|Ceelo Green has been trying to get anybody's attention for some time now since leaving Goodie Mob a few years back.  Ceelo Green And His Perfect Imperfections was way outside of the norm compared to anything on Goodie Mob's Soul Food or Still Standing.  Cee-Lo Green...Is The Soul Machine also did little for his career despite being one of the most creative disc to come out that year.  Now he pairs up with Danger Mouse, the producer/DJ who brought us the Grey Album (Jay-Z's lyrics from The Black Album mixed with songs from The Beatles' White Album).  The two put their creative minds together for a smorgasbord of cuts that make up St. Elsewhere, the debut offering from the collective known as Gnarls Barkley.<br /><br />\\"Crazy\\" seems to be the world's favorite track including Paris Hilton, who is rumored to be including a cover of the song on her upcoming album!  But the creative juices keep flowing well past \\"Crazy.\\"  \\"Go Go Gadget Gospel,\\" is a melting pot of high-energy beats and inspired lyrics possibly from a higher power than Cee-lo himself.  The moody backdrop on \\"St. Elsewhere\\" along with Cee-Lo's sermon-like lyrics give the song its infectious appeal.  \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\" is an interesting spin on Brit Rock and Electronica fused together.  \\"Smiley Faces\\" is a bebop-meets-experimental groove that continues the hypnotic fascination that is present throughout the album.  \\"The Boogie Monster\\" is a little too trippy, while \\"Feng Shui\\" couples an Asian undertone with a down-tempo riff.  \\"Just A Thought\\" sounds like something that would have been a jam session from the recording of Andre 3000's The Love Below.<br /><br />\\"Transformer\\" sounds like a sped-up Cee-lo cut from one of his solo efforts while the melodic \\"Who Cares\\" is a good contender for a second single.  The album closes with the enchanting grooves of \\"On-line,\\" the overly-odd \\"Necromancing,\\" the hyperactive medley of \\"Storm Coming,\\" and the head-nodding jam titled \\"The Last Time.\\"  Gnarls Barkley is like nothing else on the market....that's for sure.

B000EMGAGW|2.0|Mobb Deep have been grinding since I can remember.  Even in the early days of The Infamous, they were known to the true hip-hop heads but struggled to be acknowledged from the mainstream and had modest sales on practically every album they put out.  Now they sign their life away for a paycheck with Blood Money, an album the puts the loyalty of all Mobb Deep fans to the test.  It's not like Mobb Deep had this impeccable rap career that was ballin' out of control or something.  After the lackluster showings of the mediocre offerings of Infamy and Amerikas Nightmare, Mobb Deep had hit a wall with their career.  Most other artists would have ended up back in the hood wondering what happened to their career.  Luckily for them, 50 Cent had a lifeline for them and they became millionaires overnight according to them.  However, they'll have a tough time convincing the masses that Blood Money is worth the paper it's printed on.<br /><br />The few standout tracks include \\"Speakin So Freely,\\" \\"Daydreamin',\\" and \\"Put Em In Their Place.\\"  \\"Outta Control\\" (Remix) with 50 Cent is a good '50 Cent' song with Mobb Deep bringing up the rear with their cameo appearance.  \\"It's Alright\\" with 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige lives up to the song title when it comes to judging how good this song is.<br /><br />Some of the worst stuff has to be \\"Creep\\" with 50 Cent, \\"Have A Party\\" with 50 Cent and Nate Dogg, and \\"Pearly Gates\\" with 50 Cent (figure out the pattern here?).  Other wack joints include \\"Capital P, Capital H,\\" \\"Backstage Pass,\\" \\"Give It To Me\\" featuring Young Buck, \\"Click Click\\" with Tony Yayo, and \\"In Love With The Moulah.\\"  Mobb Deep has never been this wack before.  They definitely don't need 50 Cent's expertise to put together a decent album, but I guess they need 50's checkbook to line their pockets.  Who can blame them?  Wouldn't you put out a wack album for a million dollars, even if it turned out to be Blood Money?
B00005JMEW|5.0|There was a time when science-fiction was considered mere pulp trash. It didn't matter to the kids back then--they loved it. They snuck their comics under the covers at night with a flashlight and played hookey in order to see the latest serial at the cinema. When they grew up, they wanted to bring that childhood love of theirs to the big screen, with one change: they wanted their movies to be respected. <br /> <br />And so, we have Star Wars, and the modern Battlestar Galactica and Firefly/Serenity. Sci-fi isn't mere pulp, anymore (if ever it truly was), no matter what the older generations might continue to feel. <br /> <br />Tarantino's plan is roughly the same, though his role-models are different. He's a fan of the action-packed 70s flicks. Kill Bill, vol. 1, is his ode to Kung Fu extravaganzas, with one change: respectability. <br /> <br />It's not a very complicated plot. Uma Thurman (\\"the Bride\\") was beaten into a coma on her wedding day, and now looks for revenge against those what done the beating (and especially their leader, Bill). The movie is about her gaining that revenge, usually through long and gory fight sequences. <br /> <br />Tarantino earns the respect he craves for his Martial Arts movie by 1) having quality actors fulfill the roles, 2) an awesome score, featured prominently (par for Tarantino's course) and 3) a variety of interesting and always changing visual and narrative styles. He shifts from black and white to color to animated sequences to flashbacks and back again. Neither the camera angles nor the kill-shots (and there are a bunch!) are ever duplicated. Everyone is provocatively dressed and distinctive, each sequence has its own feel, pacing and rhythm. A two-hour long Kung Fu movie with non-stop action could become boring. Tarantino never allows it. <br /> <br />That is his genius. <br /> <br />It turns out that every genre of film can be \\"good art.\\" I'm not sure whether Kill Bill would be the first \\"artistic\\" martial arts movie, orif it even matters. What matters to me is that this movie is a lot of fun--gruesome, violent fun. A striking film that students of cinema, and fans of old-time karate action alike, must see.
B000002VFW|4.0|This is the album that proved to the world (as well as Black folks everywhere) that Teena Marie isn't the only white girl with soul.  Proclaiming Barry White as her primary influence, Lisa Stansfield was an overnight sensation with the release of Affection.  Although not solid all the way through, it's still worthy of being picked up the next time you see it in the used bin if you never bought the album.  Affection had a soulful dance groove that can heard in a lot of other music by the likes of the Brand New Heavies and Soul II Soul.  Classic cuts like the infectious singles \\"All Around The World,\\" \\"You Can't Deny It,\\" and \\"This Is The Right Time\\" will definitely have you reverting back to the easy-going times of the early 90s.  And even though \\"All Woman\\" was a huge single on her follow-up album, Affection still stands the test of time as being the standout album of Lisa Stansfield's career.
B000002KIE|5.0|The only studio album by the Sex Pistols was greatly anticipated and didn't disappoint for buyers who did not have access to the UK singles or live/studio bootlegs that were available at that time.<br /><br />For those who purchased other releases, the album did not break any new ground with the songs. Most material had been part of the band's live shows or had been officially released as A- and B-sides of singles.<br /><br />But here was a group who's music was banned on UK radio, its name not permitted on the UK charts and had numerous concerts cancelled because of the \\"threat\\" of violence from the fans & band members. Not only all that, the band was cashing checks from major record companies that signed 'em and dumped 'em seemingly overnight.<br /><br />And through all the controversy came the U.S. album release. The power of the band - driven by the vocals of Johnny Lydon - is captured in classics like Anarchy in the UK, God Save the Queen and No Feelings. There were questions on who performed on the album, with persistent rumors that guitarist Chris Spedding played on most of the cuts.<br /><br />While the album received either rave or poor reviews by the critics, a U.S. tour was in the works, with one published report stating the Pistols were going to perform at Madison Square Garden with tickets costing a couple of bucks. Like so much surrounding the band, the MSG show was 99.9% myth.<br /><br />The Pistols were slated to debut in the U.S. with a performance on Saturday Night Live and then open their tour at The Agora in Cleveland, OH. Visa problems cancelled both gigs and the band that finally arrived was as fractured as any Stadium Rock \\"supergroup.\\"<br /><br />It became a game at the gigs where the band tried to outdo one another in the department of parody. The band broke up after an absolutely terrible performance at the Winterland Ballroom in San Fransisco, which was released as a bootleg some months afterward.<br /><br />But for some brief moments in time, the Pistols demonstrated they were a great live band that could capture batches of their raw power in the studio.brief moments in time, the Pistols demonstrated they were a great live band that could capture batches of their raw power in the studio. <br />
B00004R7TP|3.0|I like this cd but I do not love it. I never understood why this is the most beloved by her fanatical fans. The cd is too busy with too many sounds going on. The lack of songs makes it hard to listen to repeatedly. This would be hard to put in your car and listen to over and over again.<br /><br />As for purely good songs, I count 4. \\"Running up the Hill\\" kicks off the album, has a throbbing, tribal drumbeat, and is the strongest track. \\"Big Sky\\" utilizes Bushes etheral voice and passionate vocals. \\"Cloudbursting\\" is interesting, had a pretty cool video with Donald Sutherland, and creates a weird drama to the song. \\"Dream of Sheep\\" is a sensual, quite song.<br /><br />I have always thought that this cd is more interesting rather than being a collection of great songs. Kate Bush is an acquired taste...she is not for everybody.<br /><br />This cd is good when you are using headphones and get to hear all the little strange noises, groans and yelps by Bush. This is not music to crank up in a car.<br /><br />I have always liked her debut \\"Kick Inside\\" the best b/c I feel that is her most organic, conventional work.<br /><br /> While Kate Bush is a very talented artist, she is also really eccentric. Many of her fans that rave about her work are also eccentric and therefore over exagerate the quality of her work. They love Kate Bush and all her mysterious romance as opposed to just loving her music.
B0002TKFRM|5.0|What a treat for the ears! <br /> <br />The Living Stereo series was wonderful then and it's even better now. This hybrid SACD has fantastic sound quality and, thankfully, is completely true to both music and the original recording. Originally recorded in \\"3 channel stereo\\" that's what you get here--no, there's nothing in the rear channels of the surround mix but that's exactly the way it should be. Taken directly from the nearly 50-year old (!) masters, the engineers did nothing at all to the sound except digitize and transfer each track to the SACD/CD master. Nothing added, nothing subtracted. And the quality of those masters is astounding--clear, bright and full. No tape hiss. No loss of highs. Just wonderful music expertly performed. <br /> <br />Dissapointed you're only getting 3 channels and not 5-7? Don't be. You'll hear the musicians arranged across the broad, but shallow, Chicago Symphony Hall just as the engineers heard them in the recording sessions in 1957. And those musicians are superb, particularly to my ears, the brass and woodwinds. This is an excellent orchestra caught at its prime. <br /> <br />In short, get this CD! Even if you don't have a universal player now, the 2 channel transfer is equally good, a faithful recreation of a classic LP. And if you can play the SACD layer so much the better because for the first time you'll hear exactly what was recorded and what the engineers heard in nearly 50 years ago.
B000AP04EW|5.0|How on earth can anybody watch this amazing, thoughtful, subtle, moving, sexy, challenging, disturbing movie and not love it for evermore? Reading some of the other amazon reviews makes me wonder whether the reviewers saw the same movie, or if perhaps they were too tired, or jaded by life, to appreciate it.  <br /> <br />Director Doug Liman and his two astonishing stars (plus a fantastic supporting task including the laconic but always watchable Vince Vaughn and the extraordinarily beautiful Michelle Monaghan in a great cameo as Gwen the laptop pathologist) have created one of the finest movies I have ever seen.  <br /> <br />The point about 'Mr and Mrs Smith' is that it really makes you think. Yes, when maybe you first see it you imagine you are just seeing another good action movie with some dollops of sex appeal thrown in. But PLEASE, remember that the people who worked on this movie spent hundreds of man (and woman)-years making it for you, so watch it again. I GUARANTEE you will start to see new, very brilliant and highly entertaining stuff in it. Like, to take just one example, the way the Smiths put their wedding rings back on when they return to the house, as if their secret lives were a kind of infidelity, which of course they are. Like the way what is REALLY happening in the film is that the violence and bad guys etc are just a wonderful and dramatic metaphor for the private, closedness that so many couples (or maybe all of us?) bring to marriages and relationships and which are utterly bound to kill the relationship stone dead. This is a movie about a couple who fall in love with each other's bodies and then, accidentally, really get to know each other and at last fall in love for real. The fact that to do this they have, in effect, to destroy their house, their careers and - almost - each other is really by the by.  <br /> <br />The movie is also astonishingly sexy. This is where you will find real sexiness; in this movie, not in nonsensicial porn movieswith no plots and bored, unjoyous actors and actresses. 'Mr and Mr Smith' is incredibly sexy because the sexiness is brainy sexiness: the kind that is the sexiest of all. Quite apart from the fact that the stars are filmed really well by this highly talented director (note, for example, the sheer beauty of the way Jane is lit when we first meet her in action in Bogota) the situations themselves have a fantastic inherent sexiness. For instance, the scene where Jane kills the arms dealer who thinks she is just a dominatrix is very sexy because of how it dramatises the strange deadliness of female sexuality: didn't someone (Rudyard Kipling, I think) say that the female is deadlier than the male? This scene would have stunned Kipling but it proves his point. And then Jane goes home in her fishnet stockings to a nice bourgeois all-American drinks party at the Colemans: notice the way this scene suggests the implicit wilful sexual energy and potency that underpins superficially bourgeois family life.  <br /> <br />I could go on, but I don't want to give away anything crucial about the plot. All I will say is that this movie really, really repays repeated viewings. I have seen it maybe a dozen times and stll find new things I love about it.  <br /> <br />Do yourself a favour: watch 'Mr and Mrs Smith.' And if you have watched it once, watch it again, and again. <br />

B000G759LW|4.0|When I heard the first single(Aint no other man)I thought it was hot for Christina to take it back old school. Of course this track is hot so I thought the rest of the album would suck. I sampled the album online and was impressed. She has some hiphop tracks on it as well which actually sound hot and Im an owner of alot of Old School hiphop. Nice album Christina, much love for bringing it back to the roots, Jazz,Hip-hop and soul.
B00005JP5J|5.0|We're all a little screwed up. <br /> <br />So are the characters in Little Miss Sunshine. All right--maybe them more than most. The father (Greg Kinnear) is a failed motivational speaker, the wife's brother is a failed suicide, the grandfather has been kicked out of his nursing home for drug abuse... well... you get the idea. The entire family races across the US in a VW bus that has as many problems as its owners in order to get the young daughter, maybe the only sane member of the clan (maybe), to a Los Angeles beauty pageant. <br /> <br />So what do you do when you're screwed up, when your family is screwed up, when the whole world is screwed up? The answers found in this film are soft and beautiful. This is a beautiful movie, absurd and real somehow at the same time. All of the technical stuff is great (writing, acting, etc.) but it is the intangible--the great compassion of the film--that carries it to greatness. It assures us that, no matter how screwed up we might be, no one gets left behind in our family. <br /> <br />Touching and triumphant.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|OK, John Mayer, whoop-whoop; I saw him on \\"Austin City Limits\\" awhile back, and I (AND my Wife, too!) thought it was Nelson Mandela's step-son, Dave Matthews.  And now, he's gone and 86'd Jessica (\\"What...ME worry?\\") Simpson, too.  \\"Fifteen Munutes of Fame,\\" Johnny...OK, all THAT aside: I don't know who Mayer is (ahem) \\"cozy\\" with, because, like Johnny Lang and the aforementioned Matthews, he HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAY.  And, again: all THAT aside, how did this @#$% manage to get the Who's bass player and Keef's drummer to provide the thythm section for this mess?  Save your money,or go buy Tony Joe White's newest CD.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Wait a minute. Hold on a sec. UPN has a brilliant show?. Is that allowed?. Veronica Mars is the best thing to ever hit UPN in that network's 11 years(not counting when Buffy transfered over, since it was a WB show). Kristen Bell stars as the title character, and she is a major find. What an absolute gem. I doubt the show would be as good if it were someone else. She is Veronica. Just like Sarah Michelle Geller is Buffy. Set in the California town of Neptune, Veronica Mars deals with our young high school heroine solving the towns' biggest mysteries, along with her detective father, Keith Mars(Enrico Collantoni of \\"Just Shoot Me\\" fame). The biggest mystery of all is the season long story arc. Who killed Veronica's best friend, Lily Kane?. It's a brilliant whodunit wrapped around intiguing, fully dimensional characters with whip smart dialogue, and teriffic humor. Rounding out the show is Veronica's best friend Wallace, Ex-boyfriend and Lily's brother Duncan Kane(Teddy Dunn), school bully Weevil(Francis Capra), and Lily's boyfriend Logan Echolls(Jason Dohring). Harry Hamlin has a season long recurring guest role, and Buffy vet Alyson Hannigan pops up as Logan's sister. Rob Thomas(not THAT Rob Thomas), is a gifted writer with a strong sense of story and detail. The show, as he writes is, is wonderfully fleshed out and visualized. The show having it's own unique and color scheme. The acting is great all around. Dohring is another great find along with Bell. The \\"Pilot\\" sets everything up so beautifully. It seamlessly brings you up to date, via flashbacks, of what has brought Veronica and her father to the place they are in now, and sets everything up the way it is now. Other top notch episodes(in a season with nary a bad episode)include the finale, \\"Leave It To Beaver\\", \\"A Trip To The Dentist\\", and so on. Quite frankly, there's too many to mention here. But back to Bell. She has such an easy way with a scene and a quip, and she has such a relatable beauty to her. I never thought anyone could match my Ms. Geller, but I think Bell may be the one to challenge that. It's a shame that the show is so low rated. It deserves a bigger audience. It deserves your time in front of the tube. It definitley deserves success on the new CW network, where it will air after Gilmore Girls. Folks, visit Neptune. You'll want to stay for several more seasons.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|I've somehow got labeled a musical snob, here's an admission for those: I'm not a Bob Dylan guy. His voice is just an acquired taste I've never acquired. I will concede he's a great songwriter but his songs are always better when performed by others like Jimi Hendrix with All Along the Watchtower, Eric Clapton with Knockin' on Heaven's Door and The Byrds with Mr. Tambourine Man. But for those that are Dylan guys, then I have the album for you with his just released Modern Times. <br /> <br />The album is a follow up is essentially the third in a trilogy of albums dating back to 1997's Time out of Mind and also includes 2001's Love and Theft (which had the unfortunate release date of 9/11) but I think that since I hadn't heard the previous two, it won't be like watching Return of the Jedi before the previous Star Wars movies. Modern Times starts off with the great Thunder on the Mountain that inexplicably name drops Alicia Keys multiple times to much effect and the song comes off like a folksy version of Johnny B. Goode. When the Deal Goes Down is a heart touching song which is heighten but the beautiful video with Scarlett Johansson. <br /> <br />In the hands of lesser lyricist, When Levee's Gonna Break would come off as a cheesy indictment of Katrina, but in Bob's hand it instead invokes early last century folk songs. Then there is the actual last century folk song, Rollin' and Tumblin' that updates to much success (but not as good as Clapton's version for his MTV Unplugged set). Be warned that the album clocks in at just over an album with only ten song (the shortest song comes in at 4:55), but Dylan is able to craft long song without making them tedious. Now if only Capton will cover some of the songs.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|People who hate Lucas for his revisions of the original trilogy ignore the fact that the Star Wars movies are works of intellectual labour that happen to be a commercial success and an insanely wild cultural phenomenon.  Contrary to what you immature fanatics want to believe, the movies belong to Lucas and he has every legal and moral right to alter it until HE HIMSELF is satisfied with the finished product.  Only a true artist has the moral courage to focus on achieving his/her own vision of perfection instead of paying too much attention to what the rabble is clamouring for.  This is a rather elitist viewpoint, but true art is inherently elitist anyway.  If you fans want to think of Star Wars, especially the original trilogy, as a piece of art that is above the usual American pop culture garage, then show more respect to Lucas' artistic drive and his intellectual property rights.  Who cares who shoots first!  The release of these outdated and imperfect versions is an insult to the freedom of artists to be creative and individualistic.
0316096199|4.0|I suspect I'm like most people who have read this book.  I read an interview with Sebold and she said as she was writing \\"Lovely Bones\\" she was struggling with the rape scene.  Because she had been raped herself, she wasn't able to write about it effectively in \\"Lovely Bones\\" until she had dealt with her own stuff.  She put down \\"Lovely Bones\\", wrote \\"Lucky\\", and then picked up and finished \\"Lovely Bones.\\"  Very interesting. <br />   Actually, I had read the above story, and then proceeded to  pick up \\"Lucky\\" on a lark at Target one day and just read the first 10 pages or so while my wife finished shopping.  I was hooked.  I was not planning on buying it, but I did and brought it home and finished in shortly thereafter.  It reads almost as a companion piece to \\"Lovely Bones\\" because you can see some of the family's muted emotional reaction to the rape/murder in \\"LB\\" played out in \\"Lucky.\\"  Obviously, \\"LB\\" is fiction, but there are some parallels. <br />   That said, \\"Lucky\\" is a very gut-wrenching read at times, but Sebold does an excellent job of describing the aftermath of the rape.  Her pained outburst to her sister and mother that \\"no good boy will want me now!\\" after the rape is so true and so real, yet rarely spoken of.  I found the book terrific, although be prepared to read some distrubing and dark (but real) descriptions.
0689854684|5.0|In an effort to add a few classics to our reading list, one of the members of my book club chose TREASURE ISLAND for us to read. Coincidently, I had recently visited a cottage, turned museum near Saranack Lake in New York, where Robert Louis Stevenson spent some time right before he wrote TREASURE ISLAND. It was a timely read for me!    I thought that I knew this story, but the years had passed and my memory was not as vivid as I had thought.  The story was as fresh to me as a new novel. This is the adventure of young Jim Hawkins who was lucky or unlucky enough to have found himself in possession of a map to Treasure Island. Jim is filled with curiosity and adventure as he sails forth on the ship, the Hispaniola.  Jim's friends who are sponsoring the voyage are Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey.   Notable crewmembers are Captain Smollett, a no nonsense and very capable seaman. and Long John Silver, a charming, but very cunning man who was hired as the ship's cook. Silver's companion is a parrot that he calls Cap'n Flint.     The excitement and danger of pirates, the lust for buried treasure and a mutiny aboard ship makes for an exciting book.  TREASURE ISLAND continues to be a great story for any child or adult who savors adventure.
B0000076BX|1.0|You'd have to be really deaf to like this album. I put it to you that if this exact album were done, not by legendary rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer, but composed, performed, recorded and produced, as is, by three no-name British rockers, no record company would even think of signing it. And if some insane record company run by monkeys did sign it, EVERY copy sold would find a permanent place either on a shelf in a used CD store, or the trash. <br />This album is simply pitiful. Keith Emerson and Greg Lake used up a potentially great ELP repertoire on the Emerson, Lake & Powell album in '86, and, it seems, just didn't have any good ideas left for this album. Instead of epic rockers like The Score or The Miracle, you get trite bulls**t like Black Moon and Paper Blood. Instead of fun songs like Step Aside, you get embarassing songs like Better Days. Instead of powerful ballads like Lay Down Your Guns, you get laughable attempts like Affairs of the Heart and Footprints in the Snow. And, not that it needs to be said, the material on this album doesn't hold a candle on classic ELP fare. Paper Blood's first verse actually suggests that it's a better song than Knife Edge; it's not. Changing States is forgettable Karate Kid music, and the one good track, Romeo and Juliet, is just that: good. When compared to the simply excellent ELP adaptations of the past: Hoedown, Toccata (my personal favourite), The Barbarian, Pictures at an Exhibition, etc. it doesn't even come close! <br />The songs really speak for themselves. <br />If that isn't bad enough, Greg Lake lost his singing voice with age. It's not just different, it's bad! It sounds simply bad! For some people, for some reason, this album alone isn't evidence enough. For those who can't tell the difference, have a listen to Still.... You Turn Me On. Either the studio version or a live version from the 70's will do. Then, immediately after the song is over, play the live version from Live at Royal Albert Hall. Repeat as necessary. If you don't hear the difference in quality, get your hearing checked. Greg Lake's decline in singing ability is the most compelling anti-smoking argument I've ever heard. <br />Do yourself a favour and save your money. Seriously. Just say no to Black Moon.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I, famous webcomic artist Kail, am a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy and the prequel trilogy, and I must say I love the idea of releasing the originals WITH the 2004 edits individually! Why? Because I wanted the box set real bad when it came out and I could never afford it because it was like $70, so it was like \\"WOAH! I cant afford that!\\" and now the movies are being released individually, so I can buy one, then buy the others later on. Thats how it's been with me for other box-set DVDs available individually: Guinea Pig, Invader Zim, Jackass, Godzilla, infact the only box sets I have are Sleepaway Camp and The Crow and thats cause I got those for my birthday. George Lucas I heart you big time for doing this! <br />Plus: Yes they will be rereleased with more edits next year in the form of a six-movie blu-ray boxset. Yoda in the episodes where he is a puppet will become CGI. No lie people.

B00004XONN|4.0|Radiohead started the new millenium with this, a fractured twitchy record, that is frighteningly alien (with a post apocalyptic chill) but at the same time warm and tender. <br />The album art says it all, showing a bleached barren landscape overrun with strange \\"evil teddy bears\\". It is Radiohead's definitive artistic statement, self consciously arty and esoteric, but at the same time it was where their sound was headed all along.  <br />Opening with the pulsing keyboards of \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" and ending (after several minutes of silence) with a soundscape of bell like sounds, which builds from what sounds like hundreds of whispering voices (and then more silence). Kid A is an arresting listen, it demands that you hear the whole thing from start to finish. And it's very easy to want to do so.  <br />Some would find it too shocking, indeed, it has been described as nightmarish. But underneath everything the songs are still pure in their intent, and if one concentrates on them, they can create their own story from it. The lyrics are full of confusion, loneliness, anger, and defiance, something Radiohead are known for. The guitars may be gone but Radiohead are still there.  <br />Sonically, the album relies largely on repetition, particularly the bassline of the terrific \\"The National Anthem\\" and the beats scattered throughout the album are something to marvel at, sparse and metallic, but oh so listenable. The album also takes in styles not covered before by Radiohead such as electronic music in \\"Ideoteque\\", an abstract and very thin (and also the most vocal centred song on the album) ode to what seems to be human sin and ignorance. <br />Kid A is a hard record to love, but a rewarding experience is one can find the way in. It is a transcendant piece of music that should not be taken lightly.
6304479689|4.0|There is a very good reason for this film not living up to That the Way It Is.  I am sure if you have seen this movie you have noticed that it is much more grainey and not as bright as TTWIS or other movies for that matter. This contributes a lot to the picture not being as well received.  The fact of the matter is that MGM in it's infinite wisdom chose to shoot the movie in 16 mm not 35 mm as most all movies.  This is a little known fact.  But all you have to do is watch for many of the stage segments and you can see the photographers crawling around the various stages with a relatively small camera in hand.  They may have done this for maneuverability sake but with significant loss in quality.  16 mm is a long way from 35 mm in all measuring points.  This may also be why they have not put it out on DVD as yet.  The movie is very grainy and this adds a subconscious negativity to the movie.  I was present at many of the concerts that were filmed for this movie.  The live shows were not grainy at all and they were very sharp and well lit and came across much better than the film. <br /> <br />Content of a movie is always affected by how it is presented.  Long live the King

0440419514|5.0|I cannot paraphrase the story in any way that would do it justice. Pullman is beyond me; the story was too rich, too powerful, too complex and subtle and ambitious, and it had to be to be equal to what I now sit here wishing I could convey to you. <br /> <br />You must read it, and if you have read it already, then perhaps together, here and now, we can experience words, and maybe even create a bit of Dust. <br /> <br />The most inspired time of my life, as I remember, was during my tour of Europe three summers ago. I remember pieces of what I felt; the richness of human creation surrounding me, not just when I was among the amazing architecture of so many ages, but also when I gazed at the endless miles of soft, rolling hills in Switzerland, Austria, Holland, immaculately tilled and maintained. Something was so compelling; it shook me violently for many days, although my body never moved, but a crucial part of me was indeed shaking. Thoughts poured into my mind, making me on several occasions dizzy and alive at the same time, and at one point, when I thought I couldn't handle the strange consciousness anymore, I sat down, and out of what seemed to be frantic desperation I began writing a letter to a certain Stanford professor who did not know me, whom I had never talked to, but whom I had heard much about. <br /> <br />I wrote nearly a page, but it wasn't nearly finished, and I never did finish it; time passed too quickly, and my mind didn't stay in that amazing and different and wonderful grace for long enough. But since that summer, I named it aesthetics; I had discovered it sometime during freshman year, and that was when I started calling it aesthetics, but it had never shook me so violently for so long of continuous time until that summer. <br /> <br />And these days, just when I thought I have lost all but hope that I can relive and re-understand what I had known, I read Pullman's tale, and it was absolutely spot-on. <br /> <br />When I finished the last bookon the train, my mind drifted into an open calm for a long time, and there it rediscovered what it had known and had forgotten, but has always known. Pullman calls it intention, and I had called it aesthetics, but I think they really mean the same thing, both unequivocally human and unequivocally conscious. Pullman gave intention, or aesthetics, the form of Dust, and he made Dust beautiful, and in that open calm I remembered that I have always known Dust and that it has always been beautiful, and vast and the most meaningful thing there is. <br /> <br />It wraps around us, glowing, whenever we write or speak or engage with another; whenever we feel, empathize, or understand; or whenever we instill our intentions (or aesthetics) in anything we make or design or build or hope for. I think every person will experience it in his own way, and some level of his consciousness will know what I mean, because Dust is just the beauty of our assertive wakefulness, of our open minds, our thirst to learn and to create. It is unfortunate that we do not have a name for it, a single word in which one listen would allow us to experience the thousand page story of Pullman's tale, in an instant. <br /> <br />And lastly, a final thought occurred to me as I walked home from the train stop. I think when someone is sad or depressed, when someone has a sickness of the spirit, maybe the best medicine for him would be simply to learn something new about the world. To be inspired again. Because I think that is what we have been made for.
B000002HH9|1.0|I was a huge Cure fan in the 90s. When this came out I really really wanted it to be great. I listened to it many times.

B000FGGE68|2.0|If you're one of those that can watch an incredibly bad movie and laugh at it, this is worth a go. (I have to be in the mood for such things.) If you're not that type of person, avoid this like the plague. When I saw this in the theater, I was laughing so hard I was gasping for air and crying.    Particularly bad points:    --The \\"twist\\" at the end... if you don't see that coming... well, I don't ever want to speak to you.    --The haphazard and needless romantic dialogue. (I love romance movies mind you, but... well, you'll see)    --Horrible character development. I don't care about the kid... I don't care about her... I don't care about the romantic link... I want to kill the guy with the French accent... (Hey, that's a step above apathetic at least)    --All these special effects, and we get fangs that look like something out of a redneck satirizing gagbag... wtf?    --Ungodly dialogue. Absolutely dreadful. The worst and best part: \\"You got hemo-blood on me... it is ON!!!\\" [... like donkey kong beeeotch!!!!!] I mean, that's funny just by itself... then when you realize he just basically said \\"You got blood-blood on me...\\" and that he's a medical dr, it brings another good round of chuckling.    \\"Weapons found.... MANY!\\"    This could have been way more interesting if Wimmer would have stopped trying to [...] to dehydration through special effects and paid a wee bit of attention to making his characters something to be  concerned about.
B000E33VWW|4.0|Phillip Seymour Hoffman disappears so totally into the role of Truman Capote that you forget you are watching a characterization.  \\"Capote\\" is the story of the writer's efforts to chronicle the saga of two killers who murder a prominent small-town Kansas farming family after burglarizing their home in a futile search for money.  On assignment for the New Yorker magazine, Capote is accompanied by childhood friend Harper Lee, who serves as an effective buffer between Capote's effete sophistication (which many find distasteful) and the staid conservatism of 1960's Middle America. Most strikingly, \\"Capote\\" portrays the mammoth moral struggle of the writer, who was at once calculating, coldly manipulative and then deeply sympathetic about the plight of the two killers, one of whom he befriends and gradually coaxes to tell his story.  The tremendous fame and wealth from the resulting book \\"In Cold Blood\\" did little to offset the enormous emotional and psychological cost of writing it.  Indeed, the film strongly suggests that Capote made a (faustian) bargain with the devil and never really recovered, finally succumbing to alcholism in 1984.  The great supporting cast includes Clifton Collins, Jr.--who personifies small-time desperation as one of the surprisingly articulate killers and Catherine Keener, who simmers as Capote's stoic, long-suffering friend, sidekick and unintentional rival Harper Lee, who herself becomes nearly as famous as Capote for a time after penning \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\"  \\"Capote\\" is a serious study--definitely not a \\"family film.\\"  Director Bennett Miller's brief but arresting images of the violence (murder, execution) prick the heart. Hoffman, who was one of the best things in the 1999 psychological thriller \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" (in which he portrayed a loyal, suspicious friend whose skepticism proves fatal) gives one of the most powerful performances in recent memory--it's a masterful tribute to one of the most brilliantly tragic figures inAmerican literary history.

B000AP2ZDK|5.0|This album is a compilation of beats by a currently deceased hip-hop hero. Most of this album was made on a hospital bed; he struggled with lupus, an immune system disease. He was diagnosed with the disease a few years before the release of Donuts, but his dedication to making music was indelible. He even toured Europe in 2005 in a wheelchair. From a man who was dedicated to music his whole life, and even into his death, what kind of album do you think that man would make if he knew it was to be the last of his albums released during his lifetime? Released on his 32nd birthday, three days before his grievous death, Donuts is that album folks. Spanning 31 tracks, most of the songs last from 60 to 90 seconds. The album changes quickly, delivering many different flavors from the one and only J Dilla. <br /> <br />It's hard to rate each song individually, every one of them is so different from another that you will like some more than others, and maybe some not at all. Don't be too intimidated by the extensive amount of tracks the album, since they all go by really quickly; if you don't like one, the next is soon to come. Every track is very polished and refined, however, and Jay Dee certainly gave us an album that would have us miss him even more. If you are unfamiliar with Jay Dee, this album is the easiest and best way to get into his work. A genius comparable to Charlie Parker, as said by The Roots' ?uestlove, J Dilla has forever changed the standards of hip-hop production, and Donuts is the best example of his ability to create memorable music.
B000002MU3|5.0|This is one of those albums where a band where you thought you knew exactly how they sounded came back and switched places. Monster is a huge album massive overdriven distortion, huge songs. It is like a big Rolling Stones crossed with Nirvana epic rock'n roll album.
B000F2CC72|5.0|you can't talk the History of Music¬ Mention Michael Jackson as far as I'm concearned. the Man changed the game first as a member of the Jackson 5&then later as a Adult Solo Artist. He still is the Standard that so many are chasing. this collection of videos showcases not only hsi great music career through decades of creativity,but also showcases he is a Pioneer of Music Video. He is the M of MTV for my Money's worthy. he is the Marlon Brando aka GODFATHER of Music Video. you see a generic Cat like Justin Timberlake trying to do what MJ did oh 25 years back still along with Usher&others. MJ turned the Game out.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|The extras are great on this DVD, worth it because this is the only edition so far (lets hope for a Gold Edition).

B00009W0U4|3.0|Why did so many people have trouble following this movie? Once you realize that the scenes are in reverse order -- which should become apparent early in the film -- the narrative is quite simple. And this is actually one of the film's weaknesses.<br /><br />In \\"Memento,\\" for example, the labyrinthine reversed narrative continually forces the viewer to reinterpret everything seen earlier (later) in the movie. \\"5x2\\" provides increasing psychological depth and poignance as the story of the two lovers moves towards its conclusion (beginning). But with \\"Irreversible,\\" it's just ... well, backwards. The relatively peaceful scenes following the rape are, for the most part, tedious and dull and overlong. The big \\"surprise\\" near the end is a wet firecracker compared to several of the powerful scenes in the first part of the film.<br /><br />It is these earlier scenes from which \\"Irreversible\\" has surely gained its accolades, and much of this praise is well deserved. Both the rape and (especially) the attack with the fire extinguisher are truly horrifying -- and that's a good thing. Rarely has the repellence of brutal acts like these been caught so vividly on film.<br /><br />The spinning, meandering camerawork and monotonous thudding soundtrack are less successful, however. The techniques themselves are interesting and effective at first, but the viewer's initial sense of disorientation and unease soon turns to simple irritation as the sight and sound gimmicks overstay their welcome.<br /><br />\\"Irreversible\\" contains a number of powerful scenes and is well worth seeing for those who can stomach the violence. Just don't come in expecting a brilliant narrative, depth of characterization, or psychological complexity.

0393327655|5.0|Publishers Weekly has these seemingly oddly biased reviews that appear on the Amazon page of every book that criticizes religion, I wonder if whoever writes them...? Surely not. <br /> <br />Anyway, Harris simply makes very strong points. There is very, very little terror in today's world that is not fueled by religion, and the influence of religion in politicized scientific issues such as stem cell research is seriously stunting the advancement of (medical) science. As bleak as the situation in America looks (over  two thirds of the population is christian? yikes!), one can only hope that people will keep releasing and promoting these, and perhaps making accompanying documentaries for those not so suited to reading, to somehow combat the powerful judeo-christian religious/ID lobby. For the time being, though, the dirty tricks are beating the reasonable arguments.

B000003TA4|1.0|If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden (\\"Black Hole Sun\\" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS!!!!!Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.But the music?????O-H M-Y G-O-O-D-N-E-S-S!!!!!!!Who.....made this stuff,since I could hardly call written.Sometimes I wonder what goes through rock critics (of all ages) minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker 'classic' on it.Okay first off Kurt Cobain is a rather pittiable figure-depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where I come from-I feel sorry for him.And his band (sorry) are so ametaurish it isn't even fresh or funny.Bands like U2 or The Clash were inexperienced at first but still made great,lively and powerful music from the beginning.But all this ends up is as an aural heroin 'daze'-the guitars are cloudy,Cobain's already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here \\"Something In The Way\\" still has no vital spark.To me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as Cobain wasted his talented (which may in fact exist) on forcing us to endure his inaudible,drug crazed 'wailing' of rants like \\"Terrestrail Pissings\\".And the acoustic \\"Polly\\"?Sounds like the worst garage band in the world.So why is 'Nevermind' called a masterpiece?Simple-Nirvana,despite fancying themselves anti establishment were (and still are)the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted PR campaign since the days of The Beatles.But there (again despite critics) is where the comparasin between Nirvana and The Beatles ends-for one \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is NOT a modern day \\"More Then A Feeling\\" and nothing Grohl,Cobain or the others do is anywhere close to Beatle-esque.Not only that (even if it's not Cobains fault) his music set a new record for rock n' roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from-to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and ALL of these records sound like 'Nevermind'.Also Cobains cynical and sad outlook,although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply.....stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their past.So this began the 'grunge generation' in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record?Technically very much?Should it be stripped from the market?NEVER,and that's the only reason why this should exist.Every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is getting hurt-it's in the constitution.But also everyone has the right to their opinion so I felt compelled to get one.So if you subscribe to the grunge culture and don't have this you probably should,you'll love it.But if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble,lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear.But I had to hear it to have an opinion.My main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses-I know others feel as I do.If Nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesn't always have to be a picture perfect one.one \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is NOT a modern day \\"More Then A Feeling\\" and nothing Grohl,Cobain or the

B000HCO840|5.0|ok, i first want to say that even before i went to see the movie i knew it wasen't going to be as good as the first two X-men movies but walking in i was fairly surprised. the film in my opinion, wasent half bad. Ratner actually gives his best film. i do agree that the plot should have been more developed and some of the story lines were ignored but from what Ratner did, he actually does a nice job. the world of the mutants is under attack again when a major pharmacutical company anounces a 'cure' for the mutant gene. supressing it perminantly. this causes a split in the mutant world, for some like Rouge it would mean living a normal life but for some it means that the humans want to snub out the mutants for good. and the one person who belives this is Magneto. gathering an army to storm the place were they make the cure and once again its up to Xavier, Wolverine, and the others to stop him. since this is supposidly the last in the series, there are many deaths and some of the characters are left open for spin-offs. all in all, not as good as the first two but still an enjoyable ride. i also loved that Kitty was given a bigger role then the first two. thats why i liked it a little bit more.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Predictably, the knee-jerk reactionists whose blinding, arresting political allegiances prevented them from being able to actually focus on the merits of the film itself unwittingly supplied us with an entertaining, if troubling textbook example of the narrow-minded thought police this film sought to disarm. To such dimwitted lemmings, thank you for substantiating the need for this film.<br /><br />As for the film itself, it was, simply put, a work of sheer brilliance. Not as much a tool for \\"the left\\", as some automatons would have you believe, as it is a necessary statement on the manner in which political leaders, past and present, gain power and profit by imposing fear on society. Sound eerily familiar given today's abhorrent disgraces? If so, your mind is open. If not, your head is buried safely in the sand.<br /><br />Natalie Portman and ugo Weaving provide powerful performances in roles in which lesser actors would be inclined to overract. Subtlety in performance can go a long way toward allowing a film to get its message across and the aforementioned executed their roles flawlessly in this manner.<br /><br />I won't provide spoilers, but there are (many) scenes worth noting in this film, including the \\"V\\"-laden preamble given by V upon meeting Evey, the sequences involving the imprisoned Evey, the scenes which detailed the events at Lark Hill, including the origin of his name, and on and on and on. This film was great on so many levels that its \\"payoff\\" exists throughout the film, and not just during its incredible climax.<br /><br />For those who were put off by some of the Matrix's (another fine film) relatively disjointed, often esoteric sequences, V for Vendetta may prove refreshing in the fact that it provides more explicit explanations of its underlying meanings and origins as it moves along through the story. As such, the \\"Ahas\\" come more rapidly to the viewer, thereby allowing the viewer to focus more on the events as they unfold rather than focusing on what transpired eariler in the film.<br /><br />In sum, this was a film with a message, indeed, and that message was expertly crafted by two of the most brilliant filmakers in the game today. For those who can't seem to remove their political blinders before watching a film, I would suggest something more along the lines of a pro-war propaganda film from the 1940s. At least you won't have to actually *think* when viewing such a film.focusing on what transpired eariler in the film. <br /> <br />In sum, this was a film with a message, indeed, and that message was expertly crafted by two of the most brilliant filmakers in the game today.

B000GPIPVU|5.0|Another classic, brilliant songwriting, beautiful music arranged by Ethan Johns (Kings of Leon, Ryan Adams, Jayhawks,etc..), to go along with the best voice singing on this planet.  Anyone who likes Ray's music must see him live, it is an experience that you will never forget.  He's one of the few people on this earth that will give you chills up and down your body by just singing a song.  He's a living legend and I don't believe there's an act out today that can match his combonation of genius songwriting and extraordinary vocals.  Ray does not write or sing bad songs, you won't find a bad one on here.  You will catch yourself having a different favorite song on this album every other day.  Til the Sun Turns Black,Empty,Can I Stay, Within You, and Barfly are my faves as of right now, but that could change shortly.  This man will go down as one of the best singer/songwriters ever, mark my words.
B0001CVAME|5.0|I am generally apprehensive regarding remakes because they are often inferior to the original. I avoided this movie in the theaters for that reason. Eventually we got the DVD and I gritted my teeth to watch. To my surprise the remake covers new territory in switch films and was quite enjoyable.<br /><br />As with the original, the interplay is between mother Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Annabell Coleman (Lindsay Lohan). However, in the original the daughter, played by Jodi Foster, was the stronger of the two roles and the mother just didn't quite spark my interest after the switch. In this movie both characters play well and Jamie Lee Curtis proves once again what a great actress she is.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is that the update is very modern. Annabell is faced with motorcycle riding hunks, is a member of a hard rock group, and wants to get more piercings. The character of Annabell is wonderfully rebellious yet not completely out of control.<br /><br />As with many teens, Annabell and her mother are arguing about something constantly. With a bit of Asian magic, and a rather tricky fortune cookie, mother and daughter switch bodies. The switch itself is hilarious. One of the scenes played in advertisements continuously is when Annabell, now in Tess' body, looks in the mirror and says that she's the Crypt Keeper. Jamie Lee Curtis is perfectly believable after the transition.<br /><br />We soon find that each really struggles with the other's world. Annabell can't keep up with all her mother's cell phones, PDA, and beeper. Further, driving seems to be quite a challenge for her. Tess discovers that her daughter was telling the truth about the English teacher who is continually out to get her, regardless of how well she does. It turns out that the English teacher and Tess know each other. Tess solves Annabell's problem quite nicely. However, Tess still has other problems, particularly with Annabell's friends. The peak of Tess' problems are during a rock audition that is very important to Annabell.<br /><br />There are additional conflicts for the pair to add even more spice. Tess is preparing to get married to Ryan (Mark Harmon), who is trying to understand his soon-to-be-daughter but, as with many fathers, is more than a little clueless. Annabell also has a younger brother that she sees as a pest. The switch allows candid conversations between Annabell and Ryan and Annabell and younger brother Harry (Ryan Malgarini) where Annabell learns that Ryan doesn't want to upset her life and truly wants to understand her and Harry loves her and admires her. The poignant moments are handled quite well with minimal schmaltz.<br /><br />The true point of the movie is for each to walk in the other's shoes. In the process of doing so we get to see some well done physical and situational comedy, most particularly by Jamie Lee Curtis. Both Tess and Annabell are both empathetic characters. While the focus is on the ladies, making this a mother-daughter film, males will enjoy the generational myopia of mother and daughter. A wonderful family film that I consider suitable for most family members.uring a rock audition that is very important to Annabell. <br /> <br />There are additional conflicts for the pair to add even more spice.

B000GRU6XS|3.0|For all those who gave this album above 3 stars I suggest they listen to any one song off of this album and then immediately thereafter listen to any song off of any album before \\"Seventh Son\\". There's an earth and sky difference and an unmistakable loss in overall \\"tightness\\" in the band. First of all, they need to get rid of Janick Gers. His presence of the band is just plain ridiculous and plays a major role in the \\"messiness\\" of their sound now. Its been like 10 years that he's screwed up Maiden and these clods aren't getting the clue. Bruce Dickinson's vocals are decent, but you can tell that he just doesn't have the same pipes anymore. He's straining through most of the album and it sounds really bad. He needs to realize that his range isn't the same as it was 20 years ago and sing in a lower range that suits his voice at this phase of its maturity. Steve Harris' playing is fantastic as it always has been and probably always will be. Adrian's playing is solid, but Dave Murray hasn't a significant presence on this record and I'm afraid that the idiotic presence of Janick Gers has sorely hurt the chemistry Adrian Smith and Dave Murray had. Finally, the song writing is way below par for Maiden as has been the case for the past 10 years or so. What the heck happened? The lyrics just don't have the meat that they used to. Did Steve Harris stop reading and studying as much as he used to? I miss the feeling I had as a barely teen when I had my parents rush me a copy of Powerslave from the UK before it was released in the US. From the very first seconds of \\"Aces High\\" I was floored. Sadly, I don't think Maiden will ever do that again.

I understand that the studio is trying to take this movie in another direction for the 4th film but it was hard to see so many great charactors not make it.  The special effects were terrific and kelsey Grammer as the Beast was awesome.  I wasn't that sure about him at first but after seeing his performance he was fantastic!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This album is an amazing collection of hard-hitting rock songs of fury and an additional collection of soft and beautiful accoustic songs.  But you knew that anyway...<br /><br />I love both discs because you DO NOT NEED to listen to all 20 songs back to back!  If you want to bang your head, you spin disc one.  And if you want to lounge in a bathrobe and relax, you spin the second softer disc.  What's wrong with that?<br /><br />The Foo Fighters decided to give the fans options.  The fan is given the choice to rock out or sprawl out.  You should listen to whatever you want WHEN you want to listen.<br /><br />Buy the album and choose your poison.
0684800713|5.0|Hemingway came to his style of prose by writing the truest sentences he knew.  He says so in \\"A Moveable Feast,\\" his memoir of the Paris years when he was writing this, his first novel, but it also can be felt.  The sentences in \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" don't read as programmatic or mannered; they read as fresh, vivid, and clean, as if each had its own brimming source.   <br />  <br />Don't envy Hemingway that he was the first to write like Hemingway.  The way he wrote was by working damned hard, harder than most writers have ever worked.  He thought through each sentence as a thought as well as a sentence, and this is no easy task, and yields no easy formula.  Hence the newness and subtlety, and the sense that \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" though full of frivolous characters, is sturdy and never frivolous.  It is unified by a sort of analytic integrity, and it needed a man with both feet on the ground to lend it weight. <br /> <br />The plot of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" seems to make much of nothing.  Food is talked about, drinks are drunk, and young people do a lot of not thinking.  Jake, the American narrator, lives in Paris and travels to Spain to fish and watch bullfights.  His principle companions are a preppy leech and a weak flirt.  He's in love with the girl.  And yet the story doesn't meander because it isn't distracted by the allure of the inessential.  Go elsewhere to feel lost in France or Spain.  Hemingway was interested in making, not describing--in building art through language like Cezanne built images in paint: with deep structure trumping impressionistic reportage.  Like a Cezanne canvas, \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" seems drained of anecdote but never mundane.  It forsakes the grand gestures but leaves the formal tension.  Startlingly strong feeling bleeds through. <br /> <br />(Even the bullfight scenes, where Hemingway lets himself get a bit journalistic, come off as more color and feeling than event or spectacle.  Maybe all were one in Pamplona.)   <br /> <br />Is \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" his best book?  Maybe. \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" certainly beats it for scope and local color, and has the distinction of being one of the best war books ever written, and that's a category to care about.  But he never topped his first novel in its revolutionary honesty.  Read it when you're somewhat young, if you still have time.  It won't give you a hero to follow or words to live by, but art with this sort of integrity can nevertheless teach you how to live.  And that's heroic.
B00003ZKRM|5.0|Until late in his career, Barbirolli was overshadowed by Beecham, the greatest champion of Sibelius in Britain (perhaps the world). Their performances are very different, Beecham being more confident, extroverted, and showy in his approach, Barbirolli more moody, tender and personal. He was in general a personal musician, taking a long time to gather his thoughts about each score. Certain symphonies here, such as the 4th and 7th, come across with total conviciton--you feel and think along with the conductor.<br /><br />For many listeners, Barbirolli's Sibelius may now have risen above Beecham's for that reason--it's highly ocmmunicative. His pace is usually measured, and he emphasizes the atmospheric wind solos that flavor this music. Beecham had a superior orchestra in the Royal Phil., but the Halle was sensitive to Barbirolli's nuances of phrasing (we hear a lot of that in the mystical Fourth). The bigger, more popular works, such as the Second and Fifth Sym., can't hold their own for execution against versions from powerful, world-famous ensembles like the Berlin and NY Phil. led by powerhouse conductors like Bernstein and Karajan. But Barbriolli wasn't aiming for the grand effect, even in these works, so there's a special niche for his versions, too.<br /><br />Relegated to Pye, a secondary British label, Barbirolli did earlir versions of the First and Fift. These recordings, a complete cycle made just before his death, now rise to their rightful place on EMI. I'm giving five stars even though I am not enamored of Barbirolli's rough-hewn First (graced by some truly ugly playing), somewhat stodgy Third and underpowered Sixth, nor do I have a fondness for some of the routine incidental music that fills out the set. ('Finlandia' begins with the most grating brass chords I ever hope to hear.) But it's impossible to over-praise the best of these readings, especially a revelatory Fourth, and the sonics, dating from 1966-69, are generally fine.<br /><br />P.S. 2010 - Newcomers to this set shouldn't jump into its arms without making sure that they don't mind the mediocre playing from the Halle Orch., which does play a major factor for me. The beauties of Barbirolli's imagination (and Sibelius's) have to contend with some very unbeautiful sounds.uldn't jump into its arms without making sure that they don't mind the mediocre playing from the Halle Orch., which does play a major factor for me.

B000AM6OQ2|4.0|Here is the lowdown on the re-release of this Special Edition.  The original S.E (Green cover art) was put out by MGM in late 2002 with the Hi-Def transfer, 5.1 audio, featurettes - all the bells and whistles.  When Sony acquired MGM in 2005, they discontinued this version. Taking the existing DLT, they slapped on a trailer for their new re-make (as well as the prerequisite umpteen cross-promotional trailers) and altered the cover art (Blue!) for no other reason than to drive ticket sales for what turned out to be one of the worst horror re-makes of this truly ugly cycle American cinema seems to be going through now. So unless you're hungry for advertising, go with whichever one you can find for the least amount of money - it's all the same thing.
037571457X|4.0|This was my summer reading assignment before my freshmen year of college, so I naturally assumed it would be a long, boring novel. I was pleasantly surprised by the comic book format, and even more pleased to actually be reading a story. This is a humorous, interesting, eye-opener. I found some chapters to be confusing and a little boring, but overall, I enjoyed the read.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|I saw this opening weekend in New York to an absolutely packed and enthusiastic audience. Mostly, I loved it, but as a fan of Christopher Buckley's book, I really missed the fact that much of the main plot (much more interesting than the overschmaltzy father-son storyline it was replaced with)was completely gone. There are quite a few great twists and turns I was looking forward to seeing, and was very dissapointed that they were not there (especially since they would have rotated around J.K. Simmons' wonderful performance). Still, the movie has plenty of bite and is very hillarious, so I'd reccomend it to most people.

0141301104|5.0|I have to admit I actually have no idea this book exist. I actually thought the movie was an original and not a book adaptation. Nevertheless it was a pleasant surprise to actually read this book and it wasn't a let down either since it's the first time ever for me to read one of Roald Dahl's work.<br /><br />The main character is an orphaned 7 years old boy who lives with his grandmother who happens to know more than she should, of the secret world of witches. Not any other witches, children hating witches who wish to get rid of them from the face of the earth! He found himself trapped in a roomful of them while he was on a vacation with his grandmother. He watched as all of the describing given by his grandmother about witches comes true right infront of his eyes, while he is safely tucked behind the sceen out from their sight - but wait! They could sniff out children with their big noses!!! Cornered, they turned him into a mouse!! A talking mouse infact. Armed with that, a grandmother that's an expert with the knowledge of witches and himself being as clever as a mouse, they have quite an adventure trying to foil the witches evil scheme.<br /><br />Quite an interesting story the characters pull you in with the pace of the plots. Something to add in your children's bookshelf, and I say you wouldn't be disappointed.
0765315246|5.0|My boyfriend and friends read more sci-fi than I do (I mostly read non-fiction) and when they recommend a book to me unanimously, I generally listen. This is the latest \\"hit\\" from my personal sci-fi gurus and I have to say, even as a person who doesn't read much of the genre, I was truly impressed by this book.<br /><br />The story starts out by making the plot personal. We are immediately introduced to a cast of charming and interesting characters (well, not all of them are charming, but the non-charming ones tend not to stay important in the book!), and their fascinating stories and adventures carry this book beautifully.<br /><br />The premise of it is awesome: old people are rejuvenated in return for their military time in their new bodies. How exactly that plays out is the story.<br /><br />Since I don't usually read sci-fi, it should tell a lot about how I enjoyed the book, that I went out and bought the sequel right after finishing the first one. I can't wait for The Last Colony to finish up the trio.<br /><br />Thanks for a great book, Scalzi.<br /><br />Anyone like me who wants more of the author's writing can journey over to his blog, Whatever. Only fun if you are a liberal, is my guess, but great fun if you are that.
0553573403|1.0|I find it hard to call this fantasy. It is more like GRRM read the history of the War of the Roses and the Hundred Years War and then fictionalized both events by changing the names of the historical participants. Sorry it doesn't hold a candle to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. I find the characters hard to get interested in or even care about. I am not sure what all the fuss is about for this series, unless people have never read the actual history on which this is based. Believe me the real history on which this is based is a lot more exciting than this book.
B00009W0U4|5.0|This movie is absolutely mind-blowing. The extra regarding the special effects in the movie's goriest scene was really interesting, especially since i was wondering how they'd made it look so real. Not for the faint of heart.
B0001O3YC6|4.0|A starliner is struck by meteors and becomes a flying wreck.  Only a portion of the ship manages to land on a desolate planet.  One of the survivors is Richard P. Riddick who is a prisoner being transported by a bounty hunter who also survived.  The planet is arid and bright under three suns.  There is evidence that life once lived there as well as an abandoned scientific station.  An escape ship can be fixed with parts from the crash and a water generator can be fixed.  Seems like everyone will be able to get off the planet with a little work. <br /> <br />But then trouble begins when one of the survivors enters a dark place.  There is still life around but it clings to the dark.  Not a problem with the three suns.  Not until someone discovers that the suns are all about to be blocked by a giant planet.  Soon darkness falls and only the strength and determination of a convicted felon will be able to pull anyone through as they must finish the repairs while fending off the night predators. <br /> <br />According to some preview material when the movie was first released, Riddick is a government assassin who has outlived his mission but the government has been unable to eliminate him as he is too good.  This background gives one a different view of this movie.  The later additions to the series seem to have abandoned this idea.  Still, it is a good story of enlightened self interest.  Decent acting and good effects help drive this tale of survival.  Check it out.
0739326740|3.0|I put off reading this book until the hype got to me.  What's with the Christian culture and religious scandals?  I have to admit that the book is riveting, and got off to a fabulous start. After that, all the events seemed so contrived, all arranged just so, with perfect timing, to make everything come out right. A million things could have gone wrong for Langdon and Sophie if they were real life characters, but no, everything gets orchestrated beautifully, if improbably, by the author.<br /><br />Without spoiling the plot too much, consider the actions of Sauniere after he is shot in the stomach.  I've never been shot in the stomach, but I can't imagine a 70 year-old man doing anything more than curling up to die; but no, he spends the last 15-20 minutes of his life to create a most clever, devious, subtle set of clues for Langdon, to safeguard a secret that is so banal it is not worth losing one's life over.  How is he sure that Langdon will find the clues and draw the right conclusions?<br /><br />Just when you think Langdon and Sophie (another improbable character) have finally solved the puzzle, it turns out the solution is simply one more clue to another puzzle, which in turn must be solved.  Towards the end of the book, it gets a bit ridiculous.  The only thing that kept me going was the anticipation of a juicy secret that made all this effort worthwhile.<br /><br />So, what is this fantastic secret that a secret society kept under covers for centuries, for which people willingly gave up their lives, and for which real life people today get upset about?  Was Jesus a sexual deviant?  Was Jesus, in fact, an ancestor of Mohammed?  Did Jesus condemn his earlier teachings, including the Sermon on the Mount?  These would have been sensational enough, but still irrelevant in the context of Christian spirituality.  The real secret, which I won't give away, is so hopelessly trite that I simply can't imagine people getting worked up over it.  What am I missing?<br /><br />Does the alleged 'shameful past' invalidate Jesus' teachings?  Does it negate the Commandments?  Even if Jesus had been a sexual deviant (which historically he wasn't to the best of our knowledge, and the book certainly doesn't claim), why should that invalidate what he said?  The book's ending is a massive anticlimax. To this day I can't fathom why people get upset over the final revelation in the book.  It is so banal, almost like claiming Jesus did not floss everyday.  Big deal!<br /><br />The book's plot structure, pace, and sense of drama are excellent (if sometimes too tedious and painfully contrived).  But the ending is a total letdown. I felt that the author's talent (not to speak of my time) was wasted on a trivial, senseless issue.  A bit like Einstein using his genius to invent an onion slicer. I recommend the book, if only as an example of how an excellent work of fiction can be corrupted by a meaningless triviality.past' invalidate Jesus' teachings?  Does it negate the Commandments?

B000EYK4GW|4.0|As a kid I loved Dumbo; my kids loved Dumbo; my two tiny grandkids love Dumbo (I bought this edition for them). My adult eyes now see aspects of the flick that both awe and disappoint.<br /><br />First, the awe. The circus is presented entirely from the animals' point of view. Humans are seen as exploiters using the \\"dumb\\" animals for gain and assuming they have no feelings because they are \\"made of rubber.\\" These attitudes suffuse every human from the barker to the lowly clowns, who'd gladly kill little Dumbo for a bit of fame and fortune.<br /><br />The circus is mainly a sad affair, with constant and dreary movement from town to town often in driving rain. Even the train engine is caught in the unpleasantness as he pulls the overloaded cars up impossible hills gasping, \\"I think I can...\\"<br /><br />The supreme joy for these captives is the appearance of their babies. The new life brings smiles and warmth to an otherwise cold, confined existence.<br /><br />It is Dumbo's triumph to literally and miraculously rise above the caged horror of circus life, most poignantly epitomized by his mother's being called mad and mercilessly chained for the crime of being a mother. Dumbo, by employing his handicap, those big ears, to fly, breaks clear of his physical and psychological prison, exacts revenge on all who tormented him and his mother, and, by making more money than the circus ever dreamed of, gets to call his own shots.<br /><br />Now the disappointments. The movie is short. Disney wanted it to exceed 60 minutes, so he inserted a boring fantasy sequence about pink elephants. This is not an avante garde piece of impressionistic animation: it's filler that gets the movie to 63 minutes, breaks the brisk timing of the rest of the film, and put three generations of my family to sleep when it showed.<br /><br />The crows represent African American stereotypes that are demeaning and embarrassing and quite unfortunate when kids see them. There is a bit of redemption in the fact that Dumbo chooses them as his entourage when he could have chosen anybody, but that doesn't make up for the insulting portrayal, especially since the movie also features nameless black men as menial circus workers. Blacks are otherwise absent from audiences, townsfolk, and performers.<br /><br />Should you buy Dumbo and screen it for your kids, anyway? Yep. It's a true classic. It is a shame, though, that the producers felt the need to accept fully the shameful dictates of an apartheid era.ion in the fact that Dumbo chooses them as his entourage when he could have chosen anybody, but that doesn't make up for the insulting portrayal, especially since the movie also features nameless black men as menial circus workers.

0805076476|5.0|This book is an excellent read and perhaps even better than the movie, althought i enjoy both. The book adds much more details and history than the movie does. The book is written in a style as if the writer is just telling his life story and visiting memories and revealing details how ever he chooses. Some may not enjoy that style but i loved it. It gives you new views about society you may have never thought about before. Theres nothing not to like about this book. Read it!

0765309408|5.0|Space is hard. Humans are weak. Hijinks ensue. <br /> <br />This is one of the funniest books I have read in a long time. It also happens to be one of the smartest books I have read in a long time. It is highly likely that the two are related. <br /> <br />John Scalzi's Old Man's War has been hailed as an homage to or a 21st-century adaptation of Heinlein's vision of the brutal competition for space with other sentient beings and the ways humanity will have to adapt to that competition. This is fair and, judging from Scalzi's own comments, not unintentional. <br /> <br />But the book is far more than that. While it is deliberately tongue-in-cheek at times, it also reminds me of another of the smartest books I've read in a while, Robert Charles Wilson's Spin (which I talk about here). The science and the worldview in both books are fabrications, but such genuine fabrications that they are imminently believable. Why? Largely because of the human element. Wilson and Scalzi both focus on how people react to these extraordinary circumstances, and while Scalzi's is edged with humor and Wilson's with a sense of loss, both have scope and wonder on an epic scale that is brought home to the reader through a ready protagonist. It becomes clear after only the first few pages that not only do these writers have a wealth of invention at their disposals, but that both have been paying sufficient attention to the people and events around them to render a person on the pages of their books, not just a character.

This really wasn't very good. Radha Mitchell makes a valiant effort, as I'm sure it wasn't an easy role to do, but the movie is so sloppy and dark it's hard to appreciate all Radha does for us. I will say, most of the monsters are mega cool, and the finale is well done with some wicked special effects, but being spoiled from the video games I was just hoping for alot more, and as usual, was let down. I hear a sequel is in the works because this did above average box-office, let's hope they add some cool brighter lighting and maybe a director that has actually played the game.....
0861714911|5.0|This book is written in clear and understandable English. It gives very understandable explanations of all major Buddhist Dhamma teachings while avoiding all the mythology that entered Buddhism in the later centuries. This summary of the Pali Canon is very close to the original Buddha of history. You will find how to over come greed, hatred, and delusion by over coming clinging and the false view of self. It has the greatest explanation of the Noble Eightfold path I have ever read. The Four Noble truths are the main theme of these scriptures. If you have already read the Dhammapada and have some understanding of Buddhism then buy this for the advanced learning. However this book is not for beginners and non-Buddhists may not be able to grasp it. Bhikkhu Boddhi has written wonderful introductions to each section that really prepare you to receive the teachings. 5 Stars, thank you Bhikkhu.
B000G03Q2S|5.0|Just wanted to post a correction to the last review. The CD in the new set is not the same as the 2001 edition. The mono album has been remastered from a much better original source tape resulting in a great improvement in the sound if the original album. In addition the bonus track has been changed to the more finished version of \\"Hang On To Your Ego\\" which fans have been asking for. Sadly the credits for the disc omitted this info by mistake. While a hi-res 5.1 mix would sound better than the dolby digital , the vocals are not just in the rear speakers. In fact they truly surround the listener.  <br />Mark Linett- engineer/ producer
0385504209|1.0|Interesting idea, bad execution.<br /><br />The last thing the world needs in another reasonably literate and discerning person to pen yet another screed against Dan Brown and his excesses. For this very reason I had resolved NOT to read The Da Vinci Code, which had been almost universally damned to me. But I wondered several weeks ago about the book's enduring popularity, and so I picked up a copy last week at the library. It goes without saying that upon further review, The Da Vinci Code is a bad book.<br /><br />Whatever one thinks of the cardboard characters, the specious romantic hook-up at the end or the infuriating cliffhanger ending to EVERY chapter, those factors do not make The Da Vinci Code a bad book. They make it a mediocre book, of which there are many--especially among similarly paced and plotted thrillers.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is bad for four reasons.<br /><br />1. Dan Brown gets history wrong. I am all for playing fast and loose with historical facts. In When Christ And His Saints Slept, Sharon Kay Penman invents a bastard son of Henry I from whole cloth to serve as a witness to the events of the story. In The Last Kingdom and The Pale Horseman, Bernard Cornwell alters the historically established timeline of Alfred the Great's reign in order to make his story a more elegant and linear tale.<br /><br />But Dan Brown makes no attempt to adapt or smooth or otherwise tailor history to suit his needs: he simply makes it up. The Dead Sea Scrolls are NOT early Christian documents. Constantine did not order the Council of Nicaea. Regardless of what one thinks of the theological implications of Brown's fictive assertions, these are facts that he got WRONG.<br /><br />2. You could drive a truck through the holes in the plot. In a mystery or a puzzle story, as Damon Knight so eloquently explains, one need not understand the motivations or machinations of the main characters so long as one can eventually comprehend such actions of the other characters, the ones who drive the story. Here, not so much. How did Teabing find out about what the Vatican planned for Opus Dei? What ever happened with the guy at the Swiss bank? After going to such extremes, Silas and Bishop Aringarosa just give up? As such...<br /><br />3. The only character with a believable emotional investment in the story is the bad guy. Brown's one shining moment of characterization is when the bad guy is revealed. Of all the astounding lengths to which the various characters go to achieve their ends, only the bad guy's is truly believable. And consequently, he is the only character the reader has any reason to root for, depraved as he is.<br /><br />4. Brown goes overboard making his case for the divine feminine. According to Dan Brown, women and men held equal footing before the time of Christ. The sacred halves of the universe, male and female, were celebrated and honored equally. It wasn't until the Apostles Peter and Paul tried to get rid of Mary Magdalene (sorry, couldn't resist the whole Peter, Paul & Mary angle) that the divinity of women was called into question. Hmmm... Right. Women had it great before Constantine sided with the misogynists of the world. No oppression in ancient cultures. No treating women like property. Nope. Everything was hunky-dory because women were equal to men. Uh huh.ters, the ones who drive the story. Here, not so much. How did Teabing find out about what the Vatican planned for Opus Dei?

B00005JL3A|5.0|This is a movie that I've watched over and over again. It's created a mood all its own with a futuristic ambiance, a tough but tender lead actress role (Milla Jovovich) and non-stop action, suspense, plot twists and a show of innovative ways to get killed by zombies and in other dangerous situations (don't want to give too much away). <br /> <br />For those of us who have played the RE games, this movie provided a nice background, a sort of prequel and more depth to what was going on in the game and the reasons behind it. For anyone who hasn't played the video game, this movie is an excellent stand-alone horror sci-fi flick that is sure to become a classic and that does a good job of keeping your eyes glued to the screen and your heart thumping while you wonder what the poor characters will have to face next. <br /> <br />I would give it 5 stars within its genre.

Even though this doesn't even come close to the original, it's not a total loss. The special effects and even some of the CG are impressive. And just the look of the massive ship both before and after the tragedy are awesome to watch. But the acting is rather bland, and that totally surprised me considering the cast. Also, Wolfgang Petersen made The Perfect Storm, which was a great movie, so I know he knows how to do wave effects, but the 'Rogue Wave' that turns the Poseidon looks lame and cheap, not very exciting at all. Not too mislead anyone, since I graded this a C, it actually deserves 2.5 stars, mmmkay?

0060007737|4.0|Al and Laura Reis have put together an interesting book on branding that busy people will appreciate because it is short, clear and filled with examples from well-known brands to help you understand a variety of issues important to good branding.  Each of the 22 laws of branding and 11 laws of Internet branding is covered in about 7 pages and includes lots of charts, notes and photos in the margins. <br /> <br />The problem with this book is that the supporting \\"proof\\" is presented primarily in the form of observations of only one component of a company's branding strategy and attributes the success or failure to the level of adherence to the law presented.  While I believe that these 22 laws are important to consider, they are not the only factors that influence the success or failure of a brand.  Unfortunately, this type of in-depth research is not presented, so the arguments can be misleading. <br /> <br />The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding is easy to read, entertaining and will give you some important branding issues to consider. If you are interested in branding advice, this book is a good primer. If you are looking for a comprehensive, research-based guide to building a branding strategy, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

B000DWMN2S|3.0|I started  watching the movie with great hopes,because I generally like a non-standart cinema  Bergmann,italian neo-realism etc.Regular  flicks can be filled with fakes and very little acuracy,after all they are mostly made for the fast action.This movie is illuminating the audience and sadly I just couldn't stand the lights.1-there are no,were no and will never be any Traubant cars in the whole territory of the former Soviet Union.Traditionally Orthodox christians (as most Ukranians are) and Catholics,and probably pagan Slavic people before them did not eat any meat on Fridays,Wendsdays and some pious on Mondays too,and fast periods.How sad our hero never tasted knysh,or latkes,dills or kasha wich are the favorites in that area of Ukraine for for people of every nationality,religion or age. North West regions of Ukraine border with Belorus and this is a big territory of reaaally flat land with no green hills and no towns with Czeck.or German architecture,the buildings look more like Marc Shagals poetic paintings - grey wooden houses,vast pine forests and slow moving rivers with distincly sandy banks (remember the pebbles by the tragically destroyed village,and  a mountain creek???Hundreds of villages were burned in this region by Nazi and people do remember,for memory is the only thing left to them. <br />Well,all those above are certainly not important if compared to the portrait of the grandson.Odessa is a historically very rich in Music,art and culture,thanks to a big Jewish community,and anybody living in Odessa could only be proud to have at least some Jewish heritage.Maybe all of the above was just \\"lost in translation\\",or \\"truths\\" are like a genuine vynil leather. <br />Have nice day!  <br />
B000G759LW|5.0|Christina Aguilera's lastest album \\"Back to Basics\\" was definitely worth the wait. It is a great blend of pop,soul,hip hop and jazz. This album showcases Christina's talent 100% and it definitely cements her career as a powerhouse vocalist. Since her debut album \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" her music had matured and blossomed and you can no longer place her in the same category as Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson.I think it is very gutsy for a solo female artist to release a double disc cd and to also have a new sound and look that it truly inspired by 30s/40s but only someone like Christina can pull it off and she suceeded.This album is a must have. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks: <br />Back in the Day <br />Ain't No Other Man <br />Understand <br />On Our Way <br />Without You <br />Still Dirrty <br />Thank You <br />Welcome <br />I Got Trouble <br />Hurt <br />Save Me From Myself <br />The Right Man
0393327655|1.0|I caught the very last part of a C-SPAN show with Sam Harris discussing his book \\"The End of Faith\\" and he raised my interest enough to go out and buy the book.  It took a little while to make its way to the front of my \\"To Read\\" list, but it finally did I was expecting to find a thoughtful discussion of the problems with religion in the modern world.  Instead it turned out to be as intolerant to other views as the extreme members of religion are to each other.  In fact, it is even intolerant to those religious people who are tolerant towards other people's beliefs, stating:  \\"I hope to show that the very ideal of religious tolerance... is one of the principal forces driving us toward the abyss.\\"    Mr. Harris chooses in this book to blame religion for almost everything that is wrong in the world.  He goes so far as to blame the race-based atrocities of the Nazis on religion, and even those committed by the followers of Stalin and Mao; referring to communism as \\"little more than a political religion\\".  He does amend this a bit in his Afterword by calling the pronouncements of those kind of regimes as \\"not especially rational\\" and that they \\"are not examples of what happens when people become too critical of unjustified beliefs\\", however he fails to concede that man is just as capable of committing horrible acts in the name of race or culture as he is in the name of religion.    To be sure, there are some areas of the book which are interesting.  I enjoyed the discussion of the hypocrisy of some religious people who have no problem celebrating when their beliefs may be supported by scientific evidence, and yet reject scientific evidence where it shows some of their beliefs are in error.  Certainly his denouncement of atrocities committed in the past and present is justified.  One has to wonder though, when he discusses the surprisingly high percentage of people in the U.S. (35%) who believe that the Bible is \\"the literal in inerrant word of the Creator of the universe\\", whether that is more due to people never having actually read the bible, or perhaps worse not knowing the meaning of the word \\"literal\\" (or misusing it), than it is an actual representation of their belief.    His discussion of the morality of what the U.S. is doing versus what the terrorists are doing is also very interesting, but it doesn't go far enough.  For while there is no doubt that flying airplanes full of innocent people into buildings filled with innocent people is much worse than bombing criminals and killing some innocents by accident, one does have to ask \\"how many innocent lives are acceptable?\\"  Is it okay to have 130,000 innocent people killed as collateral damage in an attempt to punish those responsible for the deaths of 3,000 innocent people?  Would it be okay to wipe out everyone in Iraq while trying to kill terrorists?  At what point can it no longer be considered collateral damage, but instead must be considered gross incompetence or worse?  This is aside from the problem that there is no evidence to support the theory that Iraq was in any way involved in September 11th.    Ultimately Mr. Harris falls back on the same tool that so many others have used to try to push forward their intolerance of others, and that is fear.  People must fear the world being destroyed by religious fanatics with atomic weapons, and that fear is to be used to justify taking away people's rights.  In this case, he is asking for the elimination of the first amendment.  The loss of freedom of religion, and in reality that includes the loss of freed speech as well.  Fortunately for us, the vast majority of people, religious or not, have no desire to blow up the world.  We must always guard against those who would do us harm, but we do not have to give up our fundamental rights in the process, nor should we allow other people's intolerance to turn us against each other by making ourselves just as intolerant.
1592401791|1.0|Don't waste your time on this one. There are far better books out there that are a bit less biased. Paul says hi to a 16 year old Geoff and is therefore a genius. John, George and Ringo don't give him the time of day and are coincidently brooding inept idiots! Ringo can't keep time, George can't play the Guitar worth a damn, and John is led about by the nose by Sir Paul. Give me a break! He says George had a poor sense of timing. On the DVD that came with George's Brainwashed CD Jim Keltner says George had an amazing sense of time. Keltner, top session Rock Drummer on the planet, Geoff? Paul had to show Ringo how to play the drums! Listen to the ballad of John and Yoko or Paul's Band on the Run album. His drumming is not much more than competent. After the Beatles split up George and John put out thought provoking relevant music. Paul opened up a Bubble Gum Factory( Uncle Albert, Let Em In ). I think if you listen to the Beatles Catalog and then listen to their solo work it will become quite obvious that Sir Paul was not THE BEATLES as Geoff would have you believe. The guy puts Lennon's Vocal from Tomorrow Never Knows  through a Leslie and thinks this makes him a genius. Thirty seconds of impact. He constantly says we did this and we did that. No Geoff, they did this and they did that. You simply made sure it got on tape. Good job.
B00005V9IJ|4.0|About 90% of the film you only see one actor, one person on the screen: no one else expect that one man...   But even though he is the only one, it gives the movie such a powerfull feeling and emotion created by that man and the place he is on, that those 90% of the film is the thing that is keeping you watching till the very end of the credits.    Tom Hanks gives the performace of a Life time. He is the perfect choice to play the stranded man who lives on a totally deserted island for a long time. His acting is what keeps the movie alive for sure. If they had put an actor in this leading role that couldn't act, the movie wouldn't have been that maqnificent at all.    The power of the film lies in the lonelyness. Tom Hanks' character is totally alone on the island as he tries to survive. The brilliance also lies in the sounds of the island. It was a terrific move of the filmmakers to have no music at all when the main character is on the island. You will only hear the sea, the wind and the sounds the character makes. It gives a sense of pure realism and it gives the feeling that you are right there with him.   But when there is music, Alan Silvestri has composed a brilliant theme that brings the emotion up in you.  And if you have 5.1 surround sound like I have, the sounds and the music will be an even greater experience.    It looked like a impossible task: making a film that would actually work where there is only one character on the screen, where there is no music, and where the location is but one place. But believe me: they have pulled it off for sure. My congrats to the filmmakers!    So get ready for an experience of a lifetime. If you like emotional films that keep you interested till the very end, then I deeply reccomend you this motion film! Get those tissues ready, and be pulled into the world of \\"Cast Away\\", a film you won't forget and leaves an everlasting memory in your mind.
B00005YUPO|4.0|I have bought several products by the Baby Einstein company, and my daughter (now 8 months) loves every single one! Especially the Baby Beethoven/Bach/Mozart DVDs are a hit. My only gripe about these DVDs is that you cannot skip the first chapters (warnings, advertising for Little Einsteins show, etc), but I've found that on my laptop I can skip through all of that, and it's even easier for my daughter to watch and focus on the screen than on our TV.

0446677450|1.0|O.k., the author says that going to college and then being an employee is not the best way to become rich....that having your own business, or investing your money is the best way...do you really need to buy a book to know that?  He says that buying a house at a cheap price, then renting it and then wait that the price of it goes up, is a good way to make good money, thats how he made a lot of money sometime....is that hard to guess?  He says that one should get proper books, courses about finance information and real state information.....thats logical...isnt it?  He says that one should create a corporation so one can avoid paying for certain expenses. Also that giving to charity is a good way to avoid big taxes....do you really need to read a book to figure that out?  This guy has written also a mountain of other books about the same subject. If your questions are not answered with this book, i hope you dont waste your money buying more titles from this dude.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|this album is amazing, theres no doubt. workingman's blues # 2 is definitely an imortant song in the catologue. ain't talking is a late-era masterpiece. this album is exactly what it should have been: a great collection of songs from a great artist. let's try not to dissect the song meanings, like most people do with dylan, because it's not a commentary on the world at large. it never is with dylan. this album is great. leave it at that.
B00004Z459|1.0|this cd sounds like anything else in the past 10 years: 4 chorded pop punk, simular vocal melodies that follow the expected pop sound, and the worst and most cliche lyrics ever.<br /><br />save your money and check out carissa's wierd for relationship problems. check out cursive \\"the ugly organ,\\" for catchy tunes. and for gods sake turn off your radio and tv.<br /><br />when you find out that you like real music that challenges you, come back and let everyone know this review helped you.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|I was 28 when I first heard of this band. A friend of mine was on holiday in England in 1992 and had sent me a letter in which he raved about a band called \\"Dream Theater\\" who he thought I'd like.     Having grown up on Genesis and Rush (with a healthy helping of Kansas and Jethro Tull) during the late 70's and early 80's, Marillion (ably supported in my collection by Simple Minds, Big Country, Waterboys and U2) in the Mid 80's and (at the time) my latest \\"can't get enough of\\" band... King's X, I knew that my friend knew my taste well and immediately started to ring around the local CD shops to see if anyone had the CD \\"Images and Words\\". Fortunately one store had heard of the CD and had a couple of copies.     Later that week I picked it up and from the first notes of \\"Pull Me under\\" I was hooked.     14 years later and here we are with a 20th Annivesary tour live DVD set.     For me this set is just brilliant.     Everyone is in top form. James LaBries vocals, to me, are the best I've heard on DVD. The whole band really seem to be having a great time. To see John P(Guitar), Mike (Drums), John M (Bass) and Jordan (Keys) actually play this stuff is phenomenal. I feel in today's music scene there are fewer and fewer great talented musicians who can play really complex stuff yet enable it to rock and with melody, harmony and a swagger that defies classification. Seeing is believing, these guys are real. Individually they are fantastic musicians, for me the best of the best and together they make something that is simply out of this world. Superb!    When I first saw the set list I thought there were a number of tracks missing from what I thought would \\"represent\\" Dream Theater over 20 years. However the set is superb in that it represents the bands history and their latest album with only a couple of tracks that appear on other live albums and the \\"previously\\" unreleased tracks are sheer brilliance.     In regards to the mix, for me it sounds way better on the PCM stereo mix than 5.1 (may just be my set up, which is not state of the art).    1. Root of all evil (From Octavarium, 2005) - Stunning version.   2. Walk beside you (From Octavarium, 2005) - a lot more energy than the studio version.   3. Another Won (previously unreleased from 1985 - stunning - like a \\"Rush\\" meets \\"Iron Maiden\\" and uniquely Dream Theater. Far exceeded my expectations.   4. Afterlife (From When Night and Day unite, 1989) - great track (I've never heard the studio album). Far exceeded my expectations.   5. Under a glass moon (From Images and Words, 1992) - Really stunning, was never a big fan of this song, am now!   6. Innocence Faded (From Awake, 1994). Superb version, again enjoyed much more than the studio version.   7. Raise the Knife (previously unreleased from 1996 - really love this song, the band are in great form on this, sound like they are really enjoying doing it. Far exceeded my expectations.   8. Spirit Carries on (From Scenes from a memory, 1999)- the first of 3 songs that have been released live before (this one as part of Live from New York 2000). This is a 9 minute version that is superbly played.     The Orchestra kicks in from here on in....   9. Six Degrees of inner turbulence (the full 42 minute, 8 part version, from Six Degrees..., 2002).   (Parts III, IV, V and VI were on \\"Live at Budokhan (2004).   I. (Overture - Nice intro with Orchestra). II.(About to Crash - Stunning with band and Orchestra). III. (War inside my head - again, great with band and orchestra). IV. (Test that stumped them all - for me the definitive version, Mike's drumming here is just brilliant). V. (Goodnight Kiss - again great interplay band and Orchestra). VI. (Solitary Shell - the very \\"Solisbury Hill\\" (Peter Gabriel) like track, superb, hard to get out of my head. VII. (About to Crash (Reprise) - Excellent instrumental, perfect for band and orchestra, comes across really well. VIII. (Losing Time / Grand Finale). Rock on lads! This is just great, it's got all the excitement of the ending of 2112 (Rush) combined with an Orchestra. The band and Orchestra are having an absolute blast here. If I had to define the ultimate Rock / Orchestra \\"finale\\" this is it. I can see the progression and hard work that Dream Theater have put in over the years and for me it peaks here and again near the end of Octavarium and the whole of Metroplolis (read on...).   10. Vacant (from Train of thought, 2004). The \\"quiet\\" tune from the ultra heavy TOT album. This is beautifully played and sung, feels , to me, like part one of the \\"intermission\\" type tracks!   11. The Answer lies within (from Octavarium, 2005). Part two of the \\"intermission\\". Beautiful.   12. Sacrificed Sons (from Ocatavarium, 2005). Back into it again, great version of this track with Orchestra and band working superbly together. Again, I feel, superior to Studio version.   13. Octavarium (from Octavarium 2005). I find the keyboard / guitar solo intro (7 minutes) to this one a little too long (reminds me of Pink Floyd's \\"Shine On\\". (Would have preferred 2-3 minutes max). Also does remind me quite a bit in parts (particularly the vocal style) to IQ's 24 minute classic \\"Harvest\\" (from Dark Matter, 2004). (Which in itself is very reminiscent of Genesis \\"Suppers Ready\\"). Anyway, just minor thoughts in the context of this 27 minute epic. From the 7th minute on this absolutely exceeds all expectations. I think it has much more power than the studio version. It was made for the ultimate pairing of Rock and Orchestra with the 23 minute mark hitting an emotional high for me.   14. Metropolis (from Images and Words, 1992). (A version appeared on Live from New York, 2000). Have to confess, never a huge fan of this one. (\\"Pull Me Under\\", Take the time\\" and \\"Learning to Live\\" were my faves from I&W). Have to say though, this sums up the whole set. At first glance I thought, mmmm thought there'd be more of the stuff I like, and in the end, wow, I'm glad they put on a whole lot of stuff I wouldn't have chosen myself!. This track absolutely rocks, definitely now a big favorite. Totally exceeded all expectations. Check it out especially from around the 5 minute mark - Rock / Classical / Band and Orchestra - I've not heard better !     Dream Theater have exceeded all my expectations with this release. I'd go so far as to say that I'd add \\"Another Won\\", \\"Afterlife\\" and \\"Raise the knife\\" to my favorite DT tracks.     In regards to \\"six Degrees\\" and \\"Octavarium specifically, the blending of Rock and classical in this live context with an Orchestra is breathtaking. These two tracks are, to me, \\"Classical Rock Masterpieces\\" (in terms of variety / complexity / originality / highest caliber musicianship). This music as with much of Dream Theater's output over the years is right up there with .... (to think of a few) ...   - Caravan, \\"For Richard\\" (live Version from \\"New Symphonia\\" 1974) (original 1970).   - Emerson Lake and Palmer, \\"Tarkus\\" (title track from \\"Tarkus\\" 1971)   - Yes, \\"Close to the Edge\\" - (title track from \\"Close to the Edge\\" 1972).   - Jethro Tull, \\"Thick as a Brick\\" (Live version from \\"Bursting Out\\" 1978) (Original 1972).   - Genesis, \\"Suppers Ready\\" (Live version from \\"Seconds Out\\" 1977) (Original 1972).   - Gentle Giant \\"Octopus\\" (Live version from \\"Playing the fool\\" 1976) (Original 1972).   - Mike Oldfield, \\"Tubular Bells\\", (Live Version on \\"Exposed\\" 1979) (Original 1973).   - Pink Floyd, \\"Darkside of the moon\\" (1973)   - Elton John, \\"Funeral for a friend / Love lies bleeding\\" (from \\"Goodbye Yellow brick road\\" 1973)   - Lynyrd Skynrd, \\"Free Bird\\" (Live version from \\"One more from the Road\\" 1976). (Original 1973).   - Rush \\"2112\\" (from 2112, 1976).   - ELO, \\"Concerto for a rainy day\\" (Side three of \\"Out of the Blue\\" (1977).   - Supertramp , \\"Fools Overture\\" (1977).   - Rush, \\"Cygnus X-1\\" from \\"Hemispheres\\" (1978).   - Tangerine Dream, \\"Tangram Part 1\\" (Title track from \\"Tangram\\" 1980).   - Alan Parsons Project, \\"Turn of a friendly Card\\" (Titletrack, all of side two (1980).   - Frankie goes to Hollywood, \\"Welcome to the pleasuredome\\"   (title track from \\"Welcome to the pleasuredome\\" 1984).   - Marillion, \\"Misplaced Childhood\\" from (1985).   - Queensryche \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" (Live version from 1991). (Original 1988).   - Jane's Addiction, \\"Three Days\\" from \\"Ritual de Habitual\\" (1991).   - Dream Theater \\"Learning to Live\\" from \\"Images and Words\\" (1992)   - Dream Theater, \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" from (1999).   - Spock Beard, \\"At the end of the day\\" from \\"V\\" (2000).   - Spock's Beard, \\"The Great Nothing\\" from \\"V\\" (2000).   - Tool, \\"The Grudge\\" from \\"Lateralus\\" (2001).   - Transatlantic, \\"All of the above\\" (Live version from 2001 in Europe). (Original 2000).   - Transatlantic, \\"Stranger in your soul\\" (Live version from 2001 in Europe). (Original 2001).   - Transatlantic, \\"Duel with the devil\\" (Live version from 2001 in Europe). (Original 2001).   - Flower Kings \\"The Truth will set you free\\" from \\"Behold the Future\\" (2002).   - Neal Morse \\"Testimony\\" from (2003).   - Green Day \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" from \\"American Idiot (2004).     Further thought would no doubt reveal more than these classic favourites. Music, that to me, pushes the musical boundaries in terms of complexity yet still rocks with an abundance of melody and harmony, a difficult thing to accomplish without 100% dedication to create something new, endless practice and commitment. In this live context with an Orchestra, the setting is brilliant.     Disc Two has a great and very informative hour long documentary on the history of the band. There are also 3 bonus videos (sound and video quality are pretty good).  1. Another Day (Live from Tokyo, 1992). (originally from \\"Images and Words\\" - 1992)  2. The Great Debate (Live from Bucharest, 2002). (originally from \\"Six Degees - 2002).  3. Honour thy father (Live from Chicago, 2005). (originally from \\"Train of Thought - 2004).    It also features an Octavarian animation clip which is really funny and wellput together.    For me \\"Scenes from New York\\" from 2000 was a DVD that captured the best of DT at he time, touring on the back of a classic (\\"Scenes from a memory, - 1999). The band new they had a winner and the confidence was fantastic to see (much like Rush on the back of \\"Moving Pictures\\".) With the \\"Budokhan\\" DVD (2004) the band were at the peak of their \\"heavy period\\" and it realy was wall to wall \\"riffamania\\", tremendous technical skills on show, with JP just smokin'! With this latest one their is a real sense of pride and enjoyment and genuine celebration of their 20 year career. So highly enjoyable.    In recent years newer bands such as Flower Kings, Spock's Beard, Muse, Gomez, Mercury Rev, Elbow, Coldplay, Evermore,  and The Flaming Lips (from \\"Soft Bulletin\\" (1999) onwards) have held my interest, together with any new releases from Dream Theater, Marillion and Rush. This Dream Theater release is a classic.     If this sounds remotely like your sort of music, then go for it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, it's really a great show.
0767817478|5.0|This is absolutely the best Godzilla of them all - looks great in CGI!  The 5.1 sound is terrific, along with the widescreen presentation, but I would have preferred anamorphic transfer. Commentary is excellent, explaining all the special effects of the movie - not like other commentaries which seem to wander in all directions.  This one is really done like it should be. I love the giant \\"eye\\" on the DVD cover and as the focus of the movie.  Great Stuff!
B00005JP8V|3.0|At a certain point in \\"The Covenant\\"--a supernatural thriller from Renny Harlin--Sarah Wenham (Laura Ramsey) asks her roommate, Kate Tunney (Jessica Lucas), \\"Why are they called the Ipswitch Family? Are they like a boy band?\\" I knew that the audience was supposed to forget that line as soon as it was spoken, but it actually got me thinking. She was referring to a group of four teenage friends just entering college: Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait), Pogue Parry (Taylor Kitsch), Reid Garwin (Toby Hemingway), and Tyler Sims (Chance Crawford). Each one is the descendent from families belonging to Ipswitch, a seventeenth century New England colony. Each one also has magical powers that have been kept secret from the rest of the world.     The way they carried themselves, both together and apart, made them seem very much like a boy band: not only do their good looks instill a mixture of fascination, envy, lust, and hatred in those they meet, they also each have distinctive personality traits that certain boy band members are known for. (I exempt Tyler, not only from my analogy, but from my review, as well. His role in the film is virtually nonexistent, and I can't say what personality type he represents. Isn't a covenant of four supposed to have four equally active members? Dropping his character would have done nothing to damage the story, save for a few lines of dialogue.) Caleb would be the Nice, Brave One of the group (if they were singers, he would be the lead), who immediately shows an interest in Sarah. Pogue would be the Quiet But Fun One. Reid--the less prominent member--would be the Reckless Bad Boy, using his powers a little too freely for his own good.     The film goes one step further by introducing a new boy band personality type: the Evil One. This would be Chase Collins (Sebastian Stan), the latest transfer student. Apparently, one of his descendents was banished from the Ipswitch colony. Years later Chase learned of his family history and became jealous, turning him into a raging, homicidal wizard. He then made a vow to find Caleb and rob him of his power. This is because he uses his own supply far too often. Apparently, those with magical powers aren't supposed to use them so haphazardly; one can get addicted to it, leading to extreme weakness and premature aging (incidentally, this tendency to overuse is showing in Reid, giving Caleb cause for concern). How interesting that the filmmakers likened displays of magic to illicit drug use; you don't often hear about it being bad for your health.    But it seems to be helping Chase along quite nicely. Our four heroes, on the other hand, don't yet know what's going on. But they'd better find out soon, because some very strange things are happening. They see visions of a grotesque teenage ghost, specifically the ghost of a college student who mysteriously died after a late-night beach party. Sarah has a dream that she and Kate are attacked by a swarm of spiders. Caleb eventually sees how it all connects with him; his eighteenth birthday is fast approaching, and on that day, his powers will reach full maturity (it happens to all people of such ability; it's a moment called Ascending). He also sees that only he has the ability to stop Chase before its too late.    The day I saw \\"The Covenant,\\" it seemed that the plot details were lost on the audience, most of which were young teenage girls. They went into it like they would for a boy band concert, continuously hooting and hollering at the four main characters every time they appeared (they got especially loud during a scene of competitive swimming). But this is a film about supernatural powers set in modern day New England. Such an idea had a lot of potential, most of which was wasted on physical eye candy. The four young men may have been blessed with good looks, but they also go listlessly from scene to scene.     I was hoping for something that didn't make the actors' appearances the only point of interest. I say this because any film with such a shallow exterior is difficult to fully absorb. It becomes especially trying to expose what lies underneath: if one can look past the eye candy, he or she will often discover that a film has some pretty entertaining qualities. In this case, an actual story is being told, one that could have been fun had it been given half a chance.    One thing it did get right was creating an atmosphere. The film's look was classically like that of a horror movie, with every exterior scene encased in fog, shadow, rain, or any combination of the three. I distinctly remember the first scene, in which the Ipswitch Boys jumped from a beachfront cliff (and needless to say, they land safely on the shore). The shot was pointed up at the characters, giving the audience a clear view of the cloudy, moonlit sky. Most of the interior scenes worked just as well, each one looking like a Haunted House film. Every hallway was long, empty, and dark, with only flashes of lightening serving as light. It was an absolutely dead-on look for the film as a whole; it only goes to show that the methods traditionally used to frighten an audience still work.     But unless you're sixteen and female, this film doesn't have much to offer apart from atmosphere. On reflection, the story is actually quite good, especially when you factor in a number of very impressive digital shots. (Example: while driving, Caleb is hit by a truck. Not only does he not die, the fragments of his car also come back together) But in the moment, the story is hidden by a facade, one that would appeal only to a select group of individuals. I really wanted to recommend \\"The Covenant.\\" Part of me still does. But I just can't; it's simply too bogged down by unnecessary shots and improperly developed characters (such as Caleb's mother, played by Wendy Crewson). Maybe the Ipswitch Family should become a boy band; at least then, they would know exactly which audience to market their movie to.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Sleuthing teen outwits both adults and intellects alike, while continually maintaining the highest GPA at Neptune High?  Is this feasible?  For those unfamiliar with this series would probably shrug this off as being just another colorful pre-teen drama that explores impossibility and stretches both the intelligence and believability of the viewer.  As an avid first season watcher (twice watched continuously all the way through), I am here to tell inform those reading this that Veronica Mars is possibly the most genuine, well written, developed television series to be released in years.  It has that potential to even out-impress the network poster-program Lost.  From the extended openings that pull you into each episode willingly or unwillingly, completely to the end of the episode that makes you salivate for more or question the theories that are rummaging through your mind, Veronica Mars (in this critics eyes) is the best that television has to offer.  Wit, charm, engrossing storylines, and characters that leave us with a craving for more is just scratching the surface of this program.  I began this series with mediocre expectations, but came out a die-hard fan.  While this second season boasted more complexity, I still found myself back at home in a little California town called Neptune.<br /><br />To begin, I need to get out into the open that I loved both released DVD seasons of Veronica Mars to the utmost extent.  I thought both brought a strong and epic struggle between evil and good to a small town in America, but I must admit there are some vast differences between the first and second season that may sour some avid viewers.  The second season is less tight with its storyline, yet somehow (and not to be too confusing) more complex.  It is obvious that creator Rob Thomas had a bigger idea than what the season would allow, OR he is building upon the idea that the third season would be further complex thus needing two full seasons to completely develop each and every storyline.  I only mention this because the only gripe I have of season two is the huge leaps and bounds that some stories seem to take.  Without giving too much away, the Duncan Kane story seemed too big for just the season alone, the underdeveloped Kendall Casablancas' story that was interesting but needed more, or the entire Dick/Cassidy story that teetered on a more sinister note than what we were shown in this season.  There was quite a bit happening in season two that left unfinished while the bigger story about the bus seemed to be a smaller piece than what it needed to be.  Alas, I guess that is what happens when you try to outgrow from the first, most amazing, opening season ever!<br /><br />I wanted to get that out of the way because it was the only issue that I had with this season of Veronica Mars.  The characters are what keep you coming back for more and more in this illustrious television series, and this second season doesn't let you down.  The development of the brother due, Bea...I mean Cassidy and Dick Casablancas was phenomenal.  Like I mentioned before, there is a darker story happening here and I hope that it only grows with the third season.  I enjoyed the development of our characters further.  I loved seeing Veronica struggle with both the pressures of high school as well as solving the mini-crimes around the neighborhood.  I loved the fact that for a couple of episodes in this season we obviously paid homage to Twin Peaks (doesn't every television show?) with a sinister development of the parents of Neptune.  Again, I think we are growing into a darker story that may erupt with season three ... mark my word.  I also enjoyed the newfound celebrity involvement with this second season.  Kevin Smith, Joss Wheton, Steve Guttenberg, \\"The Todd\\" from Scrubs, and even Harry Hamlin was back in full swing.  It just created a richer atmosphere for the show.  It was as if they had taken the strong elements of the first season, developed further,and brought us a superb contrast between characters and story.  It was a strong blend that needed to happen for this second season, and while we may have lost audiences due to the complexity (as well as if you missed an episode in this season you missed quite a bit), I think it pulled together well.  I just think we will be stronger satisfied with the third season.<br /><br />Overall, even with the slight downfalls mentioned above, I thought Veronica Mars did a fabulous job of uniting us with old friends and new acquaintances.  This is a powerful show that continues to be both (I apologize) fast and furious.  The writing is immaculate; Veronica's use of wit and language is amazing.  It is a show that forces you to become involved with what is happening, not just sit and be a viewer.  Veronica Mars pulls you deeply into the world of Neptune and will put a smile on your face while challenging your mind.  Up until the very end, you may have an idea of the truth, but until it is revealed, you are left with only \\"I think...I think...I think\\".  This show is pure brilliance and needs to be continued throughout many seasons to come.

B000001FDK|5.0|Most movie soundtracks are full of songs that aren't that good. Grease on the other hand is full of songs by a steller cast. Each one is a glimpse either into the era that is the birth of rock and roll or into the viscuous life of the American teenager.<br /><br />Good songs that are worth listening to over and over.
0321344758|5.0|This is a wise book, intentionaly kept small to be qucikly digestible. Very cleanly and simply the author describes where are the problems customers/users encounter while browsing the web, and how web contents designers should avoid making users think (more than absolutely necessary) while trying to do something on one's pages (look for/report/buy/pay/etc). The best book I have read in years. <br />
B00003CXAE|5.0|I've been watching this movie off and on for two decades now. The chemistry between Olivia and John Trovolta is electric. Aside from the music, which is some of the best around, the acting is very well done.<br /><br />The story of innocent Sandy and Danny who is bound by the image his 'friends' have of him is the same as has played out in high schools throughout the years.<br /><br />Innocent girl, who's very innocence almost gets in the way of a wonderful relationship.<br /><br />And Danny. A street tough(well sort of) who must maintain the bad guy persona for his friends, and almost loses Sandy because of it.<br /><br />Grease is a story of how these two individuals overcome what society believes them to be to become what they want to be. An excellent movie!!
B000005JA8|5.0|I was blown away when I first heard this considering when this was recorded. I immediately saw how this was a huge influence on modern avant artists. If you love this you must check out among others, The Lemon Kittens and Nurse With Wound. Tracks on the Lemon Kittens albums sound like they could have been recorded in this same session - especially The Lemon Kittens \\"We buy a hammer for daddy\\" album.
B00005N8JG|2.0|Every track but one has a simple, thumping percussion line, an artifact of modern music which I increasingly find tedious. No doubt it is easier to appeal to the brain stem rather than the prefrontal lobes. Unobjectionable as background music, but not actually worth listening to. Perhaps best described as music which one may hopefully, in time, grow out of.
B0000025BL|5.0|Hi, \\"A music fan!\\" Please stop writing 1 star reviews to this album! I loathe your practices. Your writing so many reviews (20+) of the same album--and they're all bad--and the album's great--makes me sick to my stomach and I wish I'd never read them and you've done the impossible-almost ruining the experience of listening to \\"Bat Out of Hell.\\" Do you realize that EVERYBODY loves this album?!?!? You've brought down the star average for this album. Yours is the largest and worst abuse of the Internet of all time.
B00005JLT5|5.0|THE PIANIST is a very fine movie about the survival experiences of a Polish pianist during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw in World War II. The film contains many memorable scenes reflecting both the worst and best of humanity under extremely trying conditions. One such scene shows German soldiers bullying and mocking elderly Jewish refugees and another depicts a Russian tank blasting a building in which the pianist is hiding. In contrast, there is a scene in which a German officer finds the pianist playing the piano in an otherwise vacant building. The German officer seems mesmerized by the music and grateful to be able to experience such a pleasant interlude in the midst of the horrors of war. Immediately a bond is struck between the two men. The role of the pianist is played by Adrien Brody. Also in the cast are Thomas Kretschmann, Frank Finlay, Maureen Lipman, Emilia Fox, Ed Stoppard, Julia Rayner, Jessica Kate Meyer and Michal Zebrowski.    THE PIANIST was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Oscars were won by Adrien Brody for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Roman Polanski for Best Director. Ronald Harwood won an Academy Award as well for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. In addition, Polanski won a Golden Palm for this motion picture at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|This album is a breath of fresh air! It's refreshing, relaxing, and something you can listen to on repeat. She's a hidden gem!! This CD is a MUST HAVE for anyone who is a self proclaimed neo-soul fan or anyone who has a good taste in music. I will forever be a Corinne Bailey Rae fan!
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Wow. What can I say, Maiden have certainly come out of their shell with this release. I always knew Maiden were capable of bigger / better / and stronger things than \\"Brave New World\\" / \\"Dance Of Death\\", and here on \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\" they certainly have moved forward in my opinion.....    This is without question, the best Maiden release in a very long time. Maiden fans new and old should love this!!!...    I wont go into a detailed description of each song, just let me say that \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\" is chock full of some of the best riffs / solos I've heard Maiden come up with since their glory days. No joke, this is probably the most melodic effort they've conjoured up since the late 80's in my opinion....     You can really tell the guys wanted to kick everything up a notch on this release, and I don't think there is one song that I haven't enjoyed. It's been a long time since I've said that about a Maiden album too. None of these songs are too long, they're all perfectly balanced, and combine to make one of the finest Maiden offerings ever, that's right, EVER....     The DVD is also a very cool little bonus. It's shows them in the studio joking around during the making of \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\", and talking about various other things {instruments / recording} which is quite cool. There's a video version for \\"The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg\\" {one of the coolest Maiden songs I've ever heard}, and another for \\"Different World\\". I enjoyed this very much, Maiden is so awesome.....
B000GW88ZQ|4.0|This CD is to celebrate Madonna's returing to Japan for her outstanding Confessions World Tour. Because last time she was there for a tour was in 1993!  <br />  This is in my opinion one of Madonna's best albums. The futuristic dance-themed CD includes number one tracks around the world such as Hung Up and Sorry and her newest singles Get Together and the upcoming Jump. In this album she goes back to her roots as dance club goddess and boy does she deliver these tracks with some of her best vocals and lyrics. The album is non-stop dance. So when your listening to this album have your dancing shoes on.  <br />  This album, the import has a bonus DVD of Hung Up & Sorry the video and the making of Hung Up and Sorry, there could have been some interviews and other special features but we cant have everything. This CD when it was released had a promo book to it, which you won't find now because Amazon doesnt have it.  <br />  I would higly recommend this CD to anyone but this import is more for collectors. If you are a Madonna fan, who has every album or every single, books, etc. THIS CD IS FOR YOU.  <br /> But for a cheaper version, buy it here for about 12-15 bucks and you still get the same CD but w/o the bells and whistles, which you wont miss with the original cheaper version! This CD is fantastic, you have to have it and you too will be HUNG UP on Madonna!
0618477942|5.0|I stumbled into this book and couldn't be happier about it.  I knew nothing about Alison Bechdel other than what I read in the author's blurb on the dust cover so I certainly wasn't brought to the book by the lesbian aspect.  Nor had I ever read a memoir graphic so that wasn't a hook either.   <br /> <br />I now know Alison Bechdel and found her storytelling spellbinding and enhanced by the illustrations that accompanied the text.   <br /> <br />Fun Home romps right along through thick and thin and I didn't put it down until I read the words \\"the end\\".
B00005O5UJ|2.0|Aqualung is a true classic album. I  disappointed The sound quality,  is the same of 1997 version, say print on CD: \\"Digital Remasters © 1997 Toshiba-EMI Japan. The CD was released in 2003 with the same sound of 1997 version. The package is beautiful, in gatefold mini Lp, with lyrics and a Aqualung cart. Maybe in future, the Remasters quality for this album be better than this, a classic album can may a better treatment.  Unless you want a collectors item....don´t waste your time if your looking for a better sounding cd.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I put this on, give it one listen (goose bumps the whole time), and felt as though I'd been listening to this for years!  A great release from Dylan!
B000GCFO0I|1.0|The entire movie is a mother wandering around a town looking for her daughter, who's disappeared into some spooky underworld.  Only it's not spooky. <br /> <br />The cinematography is pretty good, giving interesting angles and sweeps.  Only you can tell you're in a video game as you go from the hotel level to the school level to the church level and so on. <br /> <br />The acting is really solid.  That is, if we're referring to cardboard cutouts of actual humans. <br /> <br />The demon creatures are terrifying.  If you're under age 7 and have never seen a horror movie before. <br /> <br />Not scary.  Not suspenseful.  Not entertaining. <br />Don't buy it.  Don't rent it.  Don't bother.
B000GB775E|2.0|Poor Lindsay Lohan - it seems between bad choices in films and even worse choices in real life, she may be about to destroy her career before it even takes off.  As an actress, she is falling into some very rough waters where she is expected to carry films on her shoulders before she has even had a chance to mature in her craft.  As a child actress, she was a natural fit for her spate of Disney appearances, with FREAKY FRIDAY her crowning achievment.  However, as a young adult, the pressure is much higher, as is the bar of success.  And movies like this are NOT helping. <br /> <br />But to be fair, one cannot place the blame on Ms. Lohan.  The fact is, she has already had a turn in a non-Disney role which paid off exquisitely.  MEAN GIRLS offered us the first glimpse of Lindsay in a post-Disney world.  The timing was on, the interaction with the cast was superb, and everything just fell into place.  But then again, that film also benefitted from a knockout script by a knockout writer (Tina Fey).  JUST MY LUCK has NONE of these things going for it. <br /> <br />Perhaps ironically, Ms. Lohan's latest vehicle is quite an unlucky choice for her.  We have a promising premise in the concept of a boy and girl with opposing luck.  Lohan is lucky, Chris Pine is not.  Inevitably through the courses of movie magic, we know that the two will end up trading places (much like Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroyd once did in . . . what was the name of that movie again?)  The only mystery for the viewer is whether this will occur through a wise old Asian or a wise old Gypsy. (Spoiler - it's the gypsy! OK, I know, I shouldn't be giving these things away!)  Like I said, we all know this is going to happen.  What we DIDN'T know was that it was going to take THIRTY-FIVE minutes to get there!  So, we kill one full third of the movie being bombarded with example after example of Lohan's good luck and Pine's bad luck.  By the time they make the switch, I had already lost interest and was planningmy lunch. <br /> <br />After the predictable bout of sudden bad luck, Lohan learns that an ill-timed kiss with Mr. Pine was what caused the change of fortune.  Problem is, the kiss was at a masquerade party, and she doesn't know whom she kissed.  What follows is perhaps the film's only somewhat enjoyable sequence as Lohan tracks down and ambushes 20 strangers with sudden and embarassingly public kisses trying to get her luck back.  <br /> <br />Sadly, this brief bright spot ends too quickly, and it is back to the formula as Lohan and Pine meet and fall in love anyway, not knowing that they are the ones who caused each other's luck to change.  If predictable hook-ups make you happy, you might find some charm in this final third of the film - that is if you can overlook the sudden need for Lohan's best friend to become a song-writer in what was obviously a \\"what do we do with the final act?\\" tacked-on storyline with positively no set-up beforehand. <br /> <br />The problem with this film is that it comes across as very \\"slapped-together\\" (To borrow from Mad TV, it was \\"JUST MADE IN TEN DAYS).  Is the director to blame?  While Donald Petrie has a few hits to his name (MISS CONGENIALTY, GRUMPY OLD MEN, and MYSTIC PIZZA) he also has more than a few duds (THE ASSOCIATE, WELCOME TO MOOSEPORT, MY FAVORITE MARTIAN).   <br /> <br />Or perhaps it is the writing team?  To date, the two credited writers have yet to muster up a single true hit, and one gets the sense that a more competent writing team would have taken a better direction with the plot and have not wasted the obvious talent that Ms. Lohan does in fact possess.  Personally, I would have liked to have seen the producers take a risk and make Lohan a much more loathsome character to begin with than she is.  Her character comes off as too nice to hate, and yet too shallow to root for.   <br /> <br />Whoever is to blame, this is clearly a sub-par effort at best, and one I hope Lindsay (or her casting agent) will learn from.  With four movies coming down the pike, she still has a shot at transitioning into a much more serious career.  I like that she has taken smaller ensemble roles recently (such as PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION and BOBBY).  A very smart play on her part.  Let's hope she can steer clear of JUST MY LUCK roles for awhile!
B000BJS4OY|5.0|From every point of view, the Born To Run boxed set is an excellent set.  The 1975 concert dvd is awesome in its presentation and splendor.  Complaints about the lighting are over-wrought and just plain false, as this is an excellent 1975 concert recording.  It is worth considering that this concert recording is derived from two sources, a professional filmographer and a bootleg film source.  It was necessary to utilize the the bootleg source in order to fill gaps.  Many people, myself included, have found that inclusion of the bootleg source adds a personal ambiance to the film that otherwise may have been lost.  No doubt about it, this is a wonderful experience.<br /><br />The documentary on the making of BTR is also excellent, though it could have been longer.  I would agree with complaints about the brouchure; it could have contained more dialogue and less pictures, as dialogue contained in the dvd is sufficiant, thereby allowing the brochure to serve as an accompanying picture book.  I have no problem with the cardboard sleeves for the discs, as that method is common when trying to keep historical material in its original release context.<br /><br />The album itself does sound somewhat better, but obviously could have been mastered much cleaner.  I would think that the original recording source was not up to standard and disallowed much improvement.  I'm not sure.  Nonetheless, it does sound better than the common market cd, as well as the gold disc I bought several years ago.<br /><br />I recommend this package without reservation.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I just finished watching the complete first season last night and I am now so looking forward to the second season.   This show is from real life and I loved every episode of it. I used to watch bits and pieces of the episodes on TV till I decided to give it a try and buy the whole season and it was worth every penny.     Please do not let us wait for a long time and release the second season on DVD. We all are waiting for it.
B00008G9JN|5.0|This is the side of Jethro Tull that I really dig. I loved this CD from the very first listen, which is unusual for me. As much as I enjoy Aqualung, I have to admit it took some time for some of the songs to grow on me. Not so here. Ian Anderson's voice was made to accompany acoustic guitar strumming (which he is very adept at both.) Alot of acoustic guitar, flute and an ample smattering of Martin Barre's brilliant electric guitar colorings. I feel like I'm in \\"Jolly Olde England\\" while listening to this. Tull were a unique, pioneering band and I feel this recording is their crowning achievement and testimony to their greatness and individuality. Not a weak or dull moment. Truly captivating and my number one recommendation for a Jethro Tull recording. Also check out Thick As A Brick, Aqualung and Minstrel In The Gallery. Very addictive!
B000002WPI|5.0|This was the plan from the group's inception: to become an empire by taking over the hip hop community through saturation of like minded artists.<br /><br />You cannot argue with that.<br /><br />1993. What a year. This marked the release year for possibly the best hip-hop album to come out. \\"Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)\\" is  an album that you will definitely enjoy. You don't even have to be a big hip-hop fan to enjoy this. Wu-Tang Clan are a band that has actual depth in their lyrics, not the processed crap that you hear on MTV nowadays. The group also incorporates Chinese themes like kung-fu in their songs (listen to the intro to \\"Shame on a N*gga\\"). And the beats, you can't help but follow along to the beats. It's just that great of an album.<br /><br />As I said before, even if you loathe rap/hip-hop with every bone in your body, give \\"Enter The Wu-Tang\\" a shot. You won't regret it.
B000002GQG|5.0|To me this is the most concise, mind- expanding recording I've heard from the Moodies thus far. I tend to look at an album by the way it flows and this one takes the proverbial cake! Every song is an enjoyable experience that envelopes the listener in heavenly, delightful sounds and rejuvenates the spirit. This is one of the best psychedelic, spiritual recordings of its time. I feel like a better person for having experienced it. I reluctantly admit I tend to \\"browse\\" through some Moody Blues CDs, but not this one! I feel it would detract from the whole journey. So if you have time to take a \\"magical mystery tour\\" this is the ticket!
0316666343|5.0|Lovely Bones might forever be a mystery to me, as I remember new facts and reach deeper conclusions of life itself, days after reading it. The story is told softly and eloquently through Susie, unusual first-person narration from heaven since her death and rape at a tender age of fourteen. She peaks down and stands guard like a sentinel watching down on her family that gets lost in despair and grief from the moment she went missing. The loss of a child, a life altering experience for the parents, spun their lives into a tornado of disbelief and sadness as her sister Lindsay and brother Buckley tired their best to remember their sister but not be forgotten by their parents. The tale bluntly throws issues of how does one deal when their loved one is not coming back home, their bed from now on  un slept in, untouched clothes thrown all over the floor in the usually teenage frenzy, books collecting dust that she will never read, Saturday breakfast with an empty seat at the table, memories frozen in time, with no new leads. When Mr. Harvey, the next door neighbor took Susie's life in the cornfield, he also took a bit of her parents, her siblings and friends and family; he chipped at them and changed their lives forever. <br /> <br />Alice Sebold wove a crafty tale of love and death, people in heaven who looked on their family members and who lived in their memories and hearts. She wrote the most amazing words and sentences, brilliant and poignant flowing through simple language reaching through the pages and grabbing the reader from the very first page. She would call an oil spill on the ground a gasoline rainbow and gave shapes and colors fantastic illusions giving her tale a dream like quality. <br /> <br />I was impressed that when in heaven, Susie was not angry at her killer, instead she used all her strength to reach out to her parents, she wanted to be found, loved, remembered, her pictures looked at, her life not forgotten and buried like her bones. Her father's obsession with finding the killer, her mother's cold mask that hardened the day she died, her sister trying to close and harden herself from what happened so other kids would not whisper about her, her brother's ordeal trying to learn what death was at his young age and her mothers mom, a wonderful and witty grandmother who almost stole the show were written as if life itself told the tale. I felt what they felt, and appreciated life more, knowing how Susie missed hers. As this story continues for years, the reader learns to love Susie's family, and their struggle to be normal, to move on and to stay together.  <br /> <br />I adored all the characters, they were real people to me, who laughed, cried, sweated and breathed, who baked pies, stole kisses and began relationships, who hanged on to her memory and love forever. I was sorry to see the story end, as the book feels like something one can read forever. Ms. Sebold wrote about the loss of one person and the domino effect it had on everyone around, a network of sorrow and of communication and support. Every time I see a stranger reading it on the bus or in the park, for a second I feel connected to them as I recall the tale in my head and the feelings it stirred.  <br /> <br />It was lovely; heart warming and sad, but I absolutely loved it. <br /> <br />- Kasia S. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000096IBI|5.0|<br />The more I watch it, the more I feel that Charlie Chaplin's sublime silent  MODERN TIMES (1936) is his finest film.  THE GOLD RUSH (1925) is too desolate for my tastes, and CITY LIGHTS (1931) does not have the exquisite Paulette Goddard (then Chaplin's wife) as leading lady.  MODERN TIMES is more episodic than other Chaplin features--six or seven one reel comedies strung together for 83 minutes.  There are two incomparable segments set in a dehumanizing factory (in this silent film, the boss speaks over surveillance photography)--Chaplin gets caught inside the gears of a machine, while much later his boss, Chester Conklin from the Keystone Kops, has the same thing happen during lunch hour.  It is hysterical to see Chaplin feed lunch to the upside down head of Conklin inside the machine.  It is also pricelessly funny when Charlie is guinea pig for a new mechanized lunch demonstration that fails miserably. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, out along the waterfront (location work was done at San Pedro harbor), an indomitable Paulette Goddard watches as her father is killed by a mob, feeds bananas to children, and is helped by Chaplin out of a robbery of food when she is starving.  The scenes with Goddard are heartbreakingly lovely, while Charlie is having a great time in prison--no work to do and free food!  \\"Can't I please stay longer?\\" he asks the warden on a title card as he is being paroled.  He will get his wish when he inadvertently becomes the leader of a labor rally waving a red Communist flag. <br /> <br />Eventually, Chaplin and Goddard set up housekeeping together in a waterfront shack.  She tags along when he gets a job as an all night watchman in a department store.  Paulette tries on a fur coat and goes to sleep on a bed up on the fourth or fifth floor.  Charlie will wake her before the store opens.  But first she watches aghast as he roller skates blindfolded, oblivious to a giant hole in the store four or five stories deep!  Then while Paulette sleeps, Charlie tries to be a good security guard on the first floor.  There is a story robbery, but one of the criminals recognizes an old pal from prison so they leave Charlie alone.  He gets drunk on a barrel of booze, then eventually falls asleep in the lingerie department under a pile of clothes.  Unemployment again in the morning. <br /> <br />Finally, Charlie tries his hand, with major coaching from Goddard, as a combination waiter and singer in a fancy restaurant.  This is the very first time the Little Tramp talks in movies, singing a gibberish song.  But Charlie quits the job when Paulette is arrested for vagrancy.  Eluding the police, the two of them head off into a sunrise and bright new future in one of the loveliest endings in all of modern movie history for me.  Chaplin's swansong to The Little Tramp forever.  Movie comedies just don't get much better than this Depression era gem. <br /> <br />I have MODERN TIMES as part of the two-disk Chaplin Collection authorized by the Chaplin Estate.  It looks and sounds like a million bucks, but curiously seems to have been trimmed by a few minutes from the 87 minute original. (All of the Chaplins seem slightly trimmed--for heaven's sake, why?) Disk two bonuses that will take you a good two hours to see--thus a full evening for everything--include a 30 minute chat with two Belgium filmmakers analyzing the movie as they watch it, deleted scenes, the nightclub gibberish song done as Karaoke to try and understand what on earth Chaplin is singing, the classic theme song \\"Smile\\" sung by Liberace, a Cuban village seeing their very first movie (MODERN TIMES) with great excitement, U.S. Labor shorts (which I could not get sound on), and a huge 250 stills production gallery. <br /> <br />MODERN TIMES is, quite simply, one of the great comedies of all time and, arguably, Chaplin's most sublime masterpiece.  It is sold individually, as a double bill with CITY LIGHTS, as part of one of two Chaplin archives boxed sets, and probably rentable from Netflicks.  With so many wonderful Harold Lloyd silent comedies now available in restored 35mm archive prints, along with the same for Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin is getting ignored again.  Do watch MODERN TIMES to see the great Charlie at his greatest.  Or near greatest. <br /> <br />
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I have to say, that movie had me on the edge... so much so I had to watch it 2 times to take it all in. I like having the hell scared out of me and this one did it.. the only thing about this movie that was a problem for me was it was a bit dark and I DO understand it's suppose to be because of the ashes from the fire... but I think the lighting could have been a bit better... the creatures, or whatever you want to call them were wild.. loved them.. This will be one of my top 10 movies ever... and I do have love all genre of films.. but this one really.. I loved it.. and I really don't understand how anyone couldn't like it at least.. anyway..I got so upset over some of the reviews for this and other movies.. that I am going to start my own reviews.. since I do have a love of all types of movies.. be it a musical, horror, suspence, love story.. I LOVE MOVIES and this one is a great one.. I own it.. and proud of it!
B00006JU7T|3.0|Having read the book and watched the movie at least twenty times in the last ten years, I can honestly say that this is the story of truth--truth about what honest cops are sometimes faced with.  Whether crooked cops are \\"meat-eaters\\" or \\"grass-eaters,\\" they are still crooked.  For cops and cop-recruits it all begins with ethics.  This is the story of numerous ethical, honest and professional men, yet sadly it is also about crooked cops and, the movie leads the viewer to believe there are more crooked cops than honest ones.  This could not be further from the truth.  One should not get carried away with the liberties that Hollywood takes from time to time.  The impression the creators attempted to leave the viewer with was sadly accomplished.  Ask people like Ray Kelly, William Bratton, John Timmoney, or Richard Pennington if they would have so easily dismissed complaints of police corruption so easily.  Policing in America is a team effort and only those fit for duty can play.  The misrepresentation and sensationalizing of the few bad acts unfortunatley leave a wider impression for the public.  The creators of the movie \\"Serpico\\" act as if the representations in \\"Serpico\\" are ubiquitous solipsism. <br /> <br />Most respectfully, <br />Dr. Charles Thomas Kelly, Jr. <br />Assistant Professor in the  <br />Administration of Justice <br />Louisiana State University-Alexandria

B00000JGHL|4.0|This movie is the quintessential example of how politics and public opinion rules the day.  Each of the actors in this criminal injustice movie are compelling.  Cusack's plight is what endears him to the viewer--restive in nature, the Louisiana boy attempts to save Pacino's administration and future but, is unable to resurrect him in the end. While Pacino is resolute in his hopes, dreams and desires, his role as the Greek mayor of New York City is plagued with a plethora of problems that he can no longer control.  His prior associations for good or bad is what is his final Waterloo.  This film is resplendent in its depiction of police and political depravity.  This is a must see film for political science and criminal justice students. <br /> <br />Most respectfully, <br />Dr. Charles Thomas Kelly, Jr. <br />Assistant Professor of the  <br />Administration of Justice <br />Louisiana State University-Alexandria
B000B8IA2G|5.0|If you want a dvd collection you can put on a rainy day or in a room you will be doing something in this dvd is for you. All great episodes this series will go on for awhile.
0140067477|5.0|For those of you who are curious about this book and may be turned off by some of the \\"negative\\" comments, allow me to offer my humble opinion. I think that those people who did not like this book or felt it did not explain taoism, just really don't get the point. Taoism most certainly isn't something you seek and seek and then get frustrated at not finding, then angry, and then seek and seek. Taoism seen especially through Pooh's eyes and actions (or should I say \\"inactions\\") comes so near the mark to beginning to understand this ancient philosophy of harmonious existence on earth with the earth, and the duality of all things. I highly recommend this book for that open minded, non-judgemental, person open to the concept that indeed anything is possible...too many of us are so grounded in what we \\"absolutely know to be fact\\", when in reality anything in this universe is truly possible. Please explore this book on your path. I also highly recommend the companion book to this, The Te of Piglet, which delves ever more into taoism.
B00004BZ16|3.0|I didn't seem to appreciate this CD as much as the other reviewers. Yes, it was more of an \\"experimentation album,\\" even so it was just overall goofy. Of course, there were some awesome songs like \\"Police on my back\\" which sounds more like the Clash's older albums and \\"The equaliser,\\" a trippy relaxing dubby sounding song that is similar to songs on their album \\"Combat Rock.\\" However, there were few songs I liked out of 36 tracks. Most of the songs sounded like something off of Barney or Sesame Street soundtrack, like \\"Hitsville UK\\". It's not the innovative masterpiece that everyone says it is. But hey, if you want to take a chance, there are a few keepers on this two disk set.
B0002858YS|2.0|In short, this cd is half good and half crap. <br /> <br />The cd starts strong with catchy guitar, and the obvious sharp synth parts. <br /> <br />The thing that gets me is this bands over popularity with a genre of music that has been around for over 25 years. Frontman Brandon Flowers complains about other successful new wave/postgarage bands success (The Bravery, The Fever, Bloc Party, Moving Units) and that they are \\"riding on our success\\".  Meanwhile the Killers go on tour with Depeche Mode after they reach platinum status and for some reason Flowers doesn't take a hint.  He has simply become the Depeche Mode of 2004-whenever this band breaks up (cuz they should). Unfortunately this band has a lot less talent than Depeche Mode, seeing as how Flowers voice is overly futzed with in mastering and he uses a pitch corrector in concert. Plus half their cd sucks and their new cd isn't sounding much better. The new single is awful. Quite terrible. <br /> <br />Now I know this review will get a bunch of thumbs down, but I know that those will be from people who have listened to each single on the radio and know nothing about real music, music history, or probably even how to play an instrument, so it won't bother me. <br /> <br /> <br />If you want real new wave alternative rock check out these bands: <br />The Bravery <br />Kaiser Chiefs <br />Moving Units <br />Bloc Party <br />The Fever <br />The Unicorns <br />Wolf Parade <br />The Doves
B000021Y7X|5.0|This video is awesome! I watch it once a week and each time I notice another new feature of this great concert. Definitely worth a buy.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Beachcoming & All the Roadrunning are my favorite offerings on this CD but there isn't a song on it that I don't like. There is a poignancy throughout especially these two songs that will touch anyone who has experienced any sad goodbyes, love OR experience related. Emmy Lou is at her best in floating harmonies, that soar with such effortlessness they seem unearthly. I hadn't heard Mark before or realized he was in Dire Straits, however, I'm a fan now.  <br />I hope this isn't the last time these two artists collaborate.
B000002MU3|5.0|R.E.M. and U2 are known as the forefathers of alternative music.  They invented the genre with their hypnotic guitar patterns, fast-forward passion, and powerful, primal vocals.  Here R.E.M. find themselves imitating their successors.  It is a friendly competition, trying to beat their young followers at their own game.  (Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery from both sides.)  'Monster' is a majestic, throbbing piece of rock music that once again reinvents the pop wheel without looking back.  Putting aside the orchestrations of 'Out of Time' and 'Automatic for the People,' R.E.M. starts over and delivers a full hand of aces.  The subject matter is about, well, Monsters, but the execution makes it a concept album without becoming artificial.  They are more consistent with the concept than most artists are, even including The Beatles' on 'Sgt. Pepper'.    Sexuality is the main monster.  It is expressed with a sort of supply side lecherousness--like much in rock's history.  There is a humorous rendering on fun novelty songs, like the entertaining \\"Crush with Eyeliner,\\" tapping into the self-consciousness of teenage interest, and the lunacy of \\"Circus Envy,\\" an even better novelty song than \\"Stand\\".  In throbbing mid-tempo, an even better rendering is given for \\"I Don't Sleep, I Dream,\\" delivering able and mesmerizing instrumentation with suggestive lyrics.  Later, \\"Tongue,\\" the athletic \\"Star 69,\\" and \\"Strange Currencies\\" are as playful as they get.  (\\"Star...\\" showcases improvisation usually exclusive for jazz, including a tongue-twisting fast-forward performance by Stipe.) However, not all of the sexuality is recommended in an irresponsible or frolicking fashion.  \\"Bang and Blame\\" certainly rounds out the reality as well as the scope of the album.  There are actually some good, serious moments as well.  On \\"I Call Your Name\\" and \\"You\\" there is tangible, aching desperation and desire.  The subject matter changes briefly, too.  The album's starter \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth\\" unveils the media monster; then \\"King of Comedy\\" reveals the greedy glam monster.    For all the alleged disappointment, 'Monster' is an entertaining and musically substantial creation by one of the most innovative and consistent rock bands since The Beatles.
B000EMGJM2|5.0|I'm not feeling this one quite as much as his debut but there are still moments of brilliance here. Songs like \\"If I Take You Home (Upon...)\\", \\"Being A Girl\\", \\"Mean Sleep\\" (featuring Nikka Costa), \\"At The End Of A Slow Dance\\", \\"The Thrill Of This Love\\" and the surprise closer, \\"The Night Is Young\\" are showcases of sheer bold artistry and a creativity that defies categorisation. I'm pretty sure the other songs will grow on me in time.<br /><br />All said, much respect to a dude with the stones to step outside the mainstream, dare to be himself and give us something different. My kinda guy! I hope he's getting the props he deserves.
B000001DTM|5.0|'Achtung' has to rate as one of two of the best albums by U2.  It ranks with 'Joshua Tree,' which has more variety, even if 'Achtung' gratifies the listener with more immediacy.  U2 reinvents their own sound wheel with the help of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, once again, but with \\"Flood\\" added to the helm.  The lyrics cover the gamut of love realized and unrealized with the fluency and passion of their best work.    Their skill and repertoire are furthered on this outing.  \\"One\\" matches the anguish and passion of \\"With or Without You,\\" but takes it to a sermon on the street addressing \\"sisters...brothers\\".  The cyclical sound of Edge's guitar pattern make the song a winning canticle.  Fast forward they really deliver with the meaty \\"The End of the World,\\" which is really more apocalyptic romantically than anything else.  \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\" also tugs at unrequited romance with splendid poetry and musical development.  If the techno hypnosis weren't apparent enough, then the harrowing opener \\"Zoo Station,\\" (the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" for them) and the heavy metal \\"The Fly\\" truly impress.  The lyrics for both are great, especially for the latter.  (Again, they are skillful at presenting human rights' victims in serious circumstances.)  As true as is necessary, they take on more playful subject matter like the spare, but eloquent \\"Trying to Throw Your Arms Around the World\\" and the mesmerizingly beautiful \\"Ultra Violet\\".  Additionally, they master power pop on the uplifting \\"Even Better Than the Real Thing\\" and the funky \\"Mysterious Ways\\".  They end their magnum opus with a stark and shimmering piece of dark somnamulism with \\"Love is Darkness\\".      If you haven't discovered 'Achtung Baby' yet, you have missed out on one of their bravest adventures.  One of their best songs is \\"All I Want Is You,\\" (from 'Rattle and Hum') a foreshadowing to this album in theme only.  It indicated that when shaking through subject matter, love comes out on top.
6305882592|4.0|This 1971 black comedy is still a stitch, even if it doesn't feel as audacious as I'm sure it once did. Directed by the maverick Hal Ashby, it is the epitome of all opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman. They actually bond over their mutual interest in death, as they keep showing up at the same funerals. However, the root of their respective interests couldn't be more different - Maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive, while the hearse-driving Harold simply likes the morbidity of it all.<br /><br />The plot is really about their burgeoning relationship, while his mother constantly attempts to make the death-obsessed Harold more socially acceptable. First, she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates. To foil any hope of romance with these women, however, he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother. She then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother Victor, a hawkish officer and Vietnam War amputee, to try to convince Harold to join the Army. The episodic structure of the story by Collin Higgins (years before becoming a director in his own right with \\"Foul Play\\" and \\"Nine to Five\\") allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters' actions. The movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements, surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone.<br /><br />Ruth Gordon is her typically pixilated self, an archetype she played for years afterward, while Bud Cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide-eyed cynicism. It's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later. There are funny sideline performances by Vivian Pickles as Harold's eye-rolling mother, Ellen Geer as an overly actressy blind date named Sunshine, and Eric Christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest. Cat Stevens' soundtrack hasn't aged as well as, say, Simon and Garfunkel's music in \\"The Graduate\\", but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings. Unfortunately, the 2000 DVD contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included.pproving priest.

1401206905|5.0|This is probably the first Batman graphic novel I ever read, and it raised my expectations to possibly too high a level for the rest of my experience with the genre. It is one of the three best graphic novels I have ever read, and you should get it now. Anybody who claims to be a fan of comic-books and hasn't read this is a liar.    <br /> <br />It tells the fascinating story of Batman's career beginnings, from his errors to his triumphs and the start of many many injuries to come. I won't sum up the story here, since other reviewers do that, but suffice to say its the grittiest crime drama I've read or seen in a long time. With no extreme villains, its clearly a Batman story, with a heavy dose of Comissioner Gordon, who, normally a plot-device at best, is a deep and fully-fleshed character in his own right who shares the story equally with Batman, to great effect. The two play off each other beautifully, and you really get the feeling of a partnership in development.  <br /> <br />Mazuchelli's artwork is concise and descriptive yet moody and incredibly gritty, and I couldn't imagine a better fit to Frank Miller's dark 'adolescent' tale of the masked vigilante. The two elements of story and art never clash, and always work hand in hand to best effect. This is the movie Batman Begins should have been.  <br /> <br />After you buy this (and you should), check out Miller's Dark Knight Returns, a tale of a disenfranchised middle-aged Batman who comes out of retirement to wreak havoc and fight a corrupt Gotham (and America). Year One and Dark Knight couldnt be more different, but somehow form perfect companion pieces and are the most satisfying takes on Batman in any medium.  <br /> <br />Also check out Tim Sale and Jeph Loeb's 'The Long Halloween' and 'Dark Victory' which take place near immediately after Year One and are great mystery pieces in their own right.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I agree with Bruce Kendall. Amazon's reviewer must either be under 30 or stone deaf. This is a beautiful compilation of great voices and talent, capable of transporting the listener far beyond the place of the intellect, straight to the heart!
B000HC2LIK|5.0|This 1982 film loosely based on Phillip K. Dick's novella, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\", hit the theatre's running, hailing international critical acclaim, and now, twenty-four years later, has become a science fiction cult classic.<br /><br />The time is 2019, and the city in which the story is told, is dark and smog-ridden, where acid rain pours down constantly. Decker (Harrison Ford) is a Blade Runner, a police officer or bounty hunter whose job it is to capture renegade replicants, human-like robots who have gone bad. The only way blade runner's can determine whether a suspect is human or replicant, is a series of unrelated questions, while the subject's eye is examined, measuring pupil movement.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer plays the leader of a group of escaped replicant's that are on the run. Hauer's performance in this film is mesmerising, and in my opinion, the greatest performance of his film career.<br /><br />The central question the film and book proposes is what constitutes being human?<br /><br />Hauer's character is a dangerous and extremely intelligent replicant. His mission is to find his creator and murder him, the inventor of replicants. He displays no mercy in this highly charged scene where they finally meet. However, in the end, this replicant displays mercy and even compassion. These so-called machines do in fact have a conscience, show kindness and even real love; ironically, the attributes and virtues that many \\"humans\\" lack in many ways.<br /><br />In terms of production value, this film, every scene in fact, was created with care and adept skill down to every detail - an atmospheric work of virtual genius.<br /><br />There are many films that one will view that might have made an impression at the time but will soon be forgotten. Blade Runner is a must to have in one's DVD library because it can be viewed hundreds of times and continue to impress.<br /><br />One of the great film's of the twentieth century.> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />
B000GCFO0I|1.0|Possibly the most incoherent and plot-less movie I've ever watched. Actually, in my opinion, worse than Plan Nine from Outer Space. From beginning to end, it makes little or no sense and for that reason I simply can't give it more than one star. The acting is fair, but the script is so poor that it can't compensate. The special effects are good, but again, without a sensible plot and set up, they're pointless, they're just an exhibition of effects. There are so many superior ghost/horror stories out there, don't spend your money or time on this one. I wish I could get my two hours back.
B000002ULO|5.0|For me, Flaming Pie ranks among Paul McCartney's best albums.  Overall, the songs are enjoyable to listen to, and the album includes relaxing sounds (such as Heaven on a Sunday, Souvenir, and Little Willow) to a more upbeat, rocking sound (such as The World Tonight, If You Wanna, Used To Be Bad, and the others). <br /> <br />This album is a good mix of songs, showing McCartney's diverse style and writing abilities, and is good to listen to on a relaxing Sunday afternoon or any time.  It's definately one of McCartney's best.
031236198X|5.0|This is a wonderful gem of a little book.  It uses a parable about a colony of easy-to-relate-to penguins to teach us how to understand and manage successful change.  It marks a departure from the data-based research John Kotter is so respected for, and takes us into the realm of everyday life. Everyone, no matter who we are or what we do in life, should read, enjoy and learn from this gem!
B00001SIES|5.0|amazing musicians.  I dont see how someone could see flaws.  Every note is perfect.  Every muse album is amazing. They are the most talented band today.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|There are two epic tracks on this album (Benjamin Breeg and Brighter than a thousand suns) so that should automatically qualify for a 5 star rating. However, they didn't just add generic fillers because the rest of the tracks on this album are very solid.     My only complaint is that some of the songs end up drifting a bit. For example they could've extracted minutes 3:00-5:00 of The Legacy, added a verse or two and made a hit single out of it that would've blown the socks off any metal fan. However, the song ended up all over the place in a 9:20 marathon.     This album features 6 songs that are over 7 minutes long which is fine with me. Some of my all time favorites being Gun's & Roses Estranged and Beethovens 9th Symphony. The great bands learn how to speed it up and slow it down, thus taking the listener on an emotional journey - just as the classical masters did in the 17th century. It is not an easy thing to do and Maiden pulls it off with mixed results. However, they should be applauded because most bands are too afraid to do this, keeping songs at 5 minutes or less so they can get air time.     The message is clear in this album, Maiden doesn't care about Casey Kasem's top 40, they just want to put out the best they have to offer doing it their way. There is a treasure in each of these songs but you just have to dig a little to find them. The bottom line is that it's a rock solid piece of work and anyone who is a fan of rock and metal should add this to their collection.
