B00005JPLU|5.0|\\"A new age has come, an age of freedom. And all will know that 300 Spartans gave their last breath to defend it.\\"<br /><br />This is easily the best film of 2007 thus far, and quite possibly the best in the last twelve months. Even for those who dislike violence, this is a heroic and outstanding movie which must be seen. The lighting and colors give this historic tale a dark aura, which brilliantly coincides with the story.<br /><br />300 is ferocious, amazing, and influential - after leaving the theatre I had the urge to give a hand to my movie-going friends with moving cars out of the wild snow, just like the Spartans helped each other on the battle field. Do you think you're fearless? You haven't seen fearless until you've seen 300.
1582701709|1.0|The Latin phrase, Ad Ignoratium, is apt: the statements made in this book are true only to the degree of the reader's ignorance.<br /><br />Hmmm, I can win the lottery just by thinking positively about it? What if everybody around me has the same thoughts? Can we all win? If I want a college degree, can I get one just by thinking really hard or do I have to actually attend classes? I have cancer; can I will it away by envisioning smiling faces? Or should I get chemo first?<br /><br />The bulk of the book employs pseudo \\"experts\\" to elevate the very real power of positive thinking to the status of a wishing well. As most of us learned as children, wishing alone rarely makes things happen. Action makes things happen, and tragically little about action is talked about in this book.<br /><br />Lots of people report great things coming to them after practicing the \\"Secret.\\" But it's unlikely that anyone will report how often it doesn't work. Like psychic predictions, we breathlessly report the \\"hits\\" and ignore the misses.<br /><br />I'm a believer in positive thinking, but not magical thinking. There is a difference. Keep that in mind when you read this nonsense.
B00005JP97|4.0|Samuel Jackson is the star here. While Christina Ricci's nudity certainly does not go unnoticed, Jackson is the one who lit up the screen. I had no idea what this was about going into the theatre, besides the fact Ricci was chained up by Jackson, and I was mildly entertained. I like music (guitars, to be specific), and without that aspect (and maybe Ricci's nudity as well) I probably would not have cared much for this movie. Jackson's guitar talents are better than Justin Timberlake's acting talents, that's for sure.
B000002MIF|4.0|Hatful of Hollow was a compilation thrown together shortly after The Smiths' self-titled debut in order to curb demand until the band could finish recording Meat Is Murder.  \\"Accept Yourself\\" and \\"Handsome Devil\\" are the only tracks that don't appear on other Smiths albums, however it should be noted that they alone are well worth the price of this CD.  Most of the songs are a little rough around the edges due to their live recordings, with the exception of \\"Back To The Old House\\".  Musically, this version is better suited to Morrisey's sad lyrics (See Louder Than Bombs for the studio version), and it offers a rare glimpse of Marr's skills on the acoustic guitar.  While Hatful is a nice collection of some of the band's best music, I prefer the more polished versions available elsewhere.
0793563836|5.0|The best bass method I ever laid my hands on so far. <br />Great audio quality and flawless notation. <br />Too bad it's just in standard notation (no tabs). <br />But worth every buck you pay for it. A must have in my opinion

B000MCH5P4|2.0|Well shot movie with interlocking plots about particularly stupid people.  It is supposed to trigger political outrage about mistreatment of particularly stupid and irresponsible people.  <br /> <br />An American couple travels as tourists into the hinterlands of the Middle East while leaving their children in the care of an illegal alien housekeeper.  I have little sympathy for these irresponsible who would abandon their children without a plan and contingency plan.   <br /> <br />A Middle Eastern teenager given a gun for self-protection against jackals employs the weapon to shoot at a passing bus.  I find it very difficult to have sympathy for attempted murder on a whim. <br /> <br />An illegal immigrant into the United States is employed as a housekeeper by the American couple traveling in the Middle East.  The American couple forces the housekeeper has to make a series of choices.  She chooses (1) to stay with the kids (who are basically deserted by their parents); (2) to go to Mexico with the children; (3) to get into a car with a drunk driver; (4) to take the kids in a car with a drunk driver.  She and the kids end up in abandoned in the desert.  I find it difficult to have sympathy for even the nicest person who makes that many bad choices after assuming the guardianship of innocents. <br /> <br />This is a movie about stupid people who make stupid choices to do stupid things.  Choices have consequences.  Some poor decisions trigger grave consequences.  \\"Stupid is as Stupid does.\\"
B00005JPCF|5.0|This animated feature is very unusual. Directed by the great Australian film maker George Miller (Mad Max, Road Warrior), it is thoughtful, endearing, funny and, at times, surprisingly dark. It's an all-singing, all-dancing version of March of the Penguins with adorable vocalizations by Elijah Wood (Mumble), Robin Williams (Ramon and Lovelace), Britney Murphey (Gloria), Hugh Jackman (Memphis) and Nicole Kidman (Norma Jean, Mumble's mom). You have to see it to believe it and you will either love it or you won't get it. I loved it. Caution: the killer whales and the elephant seals (with Aussie accents) are very realistic and pretty scary. The leopard seal is absolutely terrifying. Parents should exercise caution with very small children. But Mumble is the cutest and older kids will love his incredible journey as he teaches the worlds of nature and man to co-exist. Highly recommended.

B000MXPE7O|1.0|Without a doubt, The Good Shepherd is one of the worst spy movies I have ever seen and I think I have seen almost all of them. I'm not sure where to begin with how bad it is. The main character Edward Wilson is absolutely lifeless and there is zero explanation as to why 3 women find him attractive. There is zero explanation as to how he advances as he seems to do nothing. There are so many contradictions, dead ends, events unexplained and mistakes that you would think an amateur wrote this film. The movie is deliberately dark so as to give the Cloak and Dagger mystique but it fails miserably. And the worst part is it tries to shed the fictional cloak by trying to tie itself to real world events but again fails with so many mistakes that it becomes simply boring and ludicrous. Based on the critics reviews I had high hopes for this movie but I usually find that when the critics hail a movie that it is a bad sign.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Loved this better than any in the series.  I highly recommend Casino Royale to anyone who even remotely thinks they're a 007 fan!
B000MZHW40|4.0|In recent years, Hollywood has been on this kick of trying to make these so-called `important' films.  These are movies that attempt to call attention to something in this world, to make a statement of some sort, whatever that may be.  Generally speaking these movies are more like independent films, not widely received by the average movie audience, because in most cases the movies prove to be boring and too self-important.  Hollywood tends to get so wrapped up in trying to be so important and to rise above being pure entertainment, that it begins to talk down to the very people that keeps them in business.  Occasionally though, a movie comes along that is important for people to see, and succeeds in avoiding the pitfalls of being too self-important and hyped up to be something that it's not, and actually manages to appeal to your average moviegoer, therefore allowing the message to be heard, and maybe make a difference in the process.  One such success for Hollywood would be Edward Zwick's \\"Blood Diamond\\". <br /> <br />\\"Blood Diamond\\" tells the story of the civil war that was overtaking Sierra Leone in 1999.  In the midst of the war, Daniel Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a diamond smuggler, befriends a Mende fisherman (Djimon Hounsou) in an attempt to recover a rare diamond of immense value.  During their search the fisherman's son is taken by rebel forces and coerced into joining their militia to survive.  Now the fisherman must stay focused enough to assist in recovering the diamond which holds the key to saving his son's life and that of the rest of his family as well.  Assisting in trying to save the fisherman's son is a reporter (Jennifer Connelly) who is trying to shed light on the war that is ravaging this part of Africa, in hopes that it will force the U.N. to intervene before it's too late. <br /> <br />As I stated earlier most Hollywood movies that are deemed as being `important' films, tend to not do well with most moviegoers; however, this film stood out from the rest.  Why you may ask, well because director Edward Zwick (director of \\"Glory\\" and \\"The Last Samurai\\") was smart enough to make his story be interesting and entertaining, while including some star power that would enhance his chances of getting people to come to the movie.  Sometimes putting A-list actors in a movie like this could reduce the seriousness of the picture or overshadow the message, but here the actors chosen are known for more dramatic roles and lend more weight to the movie.  Leonardo DiCaprio, who has had a recent string of highly successful dramatic roles with \\"The Aviator\\" and \\"The Departed\\", really sinks his teeth into playing the former mercenary turned smuggler.  A different role for Leo to be sure, the character is far from likeable, yet I still found myself rooting for him, but part of me believes that had more to do with Djimon's character than Leo's.  Djimon Hounsou (\\"The Island\\" and \\"Amistad\\") as the Mende fisherman, Solomon Vendy, delivers another terrific performance and continues to show his range as an actor.  Jennifer Connelly (\\"Hulk\\" and \\"A Beautiful Mind\\") did a fine job of conveying the conflicted nature of her character as she is torn by wanting to help Solomon, yet in the process is wanting to help herself and her career by basically exploiting his plight and that of his country's.   <br /> <br />The story for the movie was solid and fast-paced for the most part, there were times it dragged along, but they were generally few and far between.  The action scenes were very intense, and spaced out nicely throughout the movie, although there were a couple of times that it felt as if the writers had realized it had been awhile since someone had been shot or something blown up, so they threw in a random conflict to spice things up, but other than that I couldn't complain about the amount of action.  I think as far as being an important movie for Hollywood to make, this film could serve as a semi-template for other films to follow, not in terms of what to base the subject matter on, but just the way the story was laid out and presented.  The key is not to talk down to the audience or beat them over the head with the message, but to present it to them in a way that makes them think for themselves, and still be entertained. <br /> <br />When it was all said and done, I would have to say that this was a very good movie, but not one that I would want to see too many times, but it definitely will open eyes to what goes on within parts of the diamond industry.  And who knows maybe it will even make somewhat of a difference. <br /> <br />\\"Blood Diamond\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|Maybe they forgot to put the laugh-track on my DVD, because I could not for the life of me figure out when to be amused.  I started the movie, sat on my couch, and waited to laugh. Unfortunately humor was missing from this and the only thing it made me feel was awkward.  The actors seemed as if they were reading lines in an early rehearsal.  Did no one else feel this?  I mean, I like Steve Carrell and Alan Arkin as much as the next guy, but they couldn't hope to elevate the contrived, derivative script.  The whole plot and every character in it felt incredibly forced, more than in any movie I can think of.  I didn't buy a second of it.  This movie sounded like it would be right up my alley.  My close friends and family told me the same thing.  Boy was I disappointed.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I recieved the movie within 2 days and it played great no scratches or skips, my family loved it.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|A great BLUES record with sublime guitar by JOE BONAMASSA, electrical as well as acoustic at similar level of the monsters like Johnny Winter, Mike Bloomfield, Ronnie Earl,Tinsley Ellis, Elvin Bishop ( who also shared highlights in the great Paul Butterfield Blues band with the master Mike Bloomfield), Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Albert Collins, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmy Page, Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton and many others. All the record songs are very good, you can find a magnificient slow BLUES as \\"Long distance Blues\\" or the title of the record \\"Blues Deluxe\\" that gets to excite. It is of justice to point out the great work of the rhythmical section, in short a sensational record.I have not been lucky to see JOE in live but if it comes to Barcelona ,sure I'll see. A must for all guitar lovers even blues fans.
B000E1MXSW|1.0|What a horror of an example to others. This is a story about a nun and her temptations about her calling. Well, in the end she fails and gives up her vocation. What a let down of a movie. As if it is the most impossable thing to persevere in one's vocation as a nun. Nice one hollywood, another blow to the religious. I felt it my duty to warn those who wish to obtain this dvd, thats why I gave away the story. audrey hepburn does a disservice to our religious by playing the role of an apostate nun, shame on her! An Audrey fan no more. This is not in the same class as 'The song of Bernadette', 'A Man for all seasons', 'Therese', 'El Cid', etc.

B000CNDIZE|5.0|I went to the store to buy a Zero 7 CD. The clerk asked me if I was familiar with the female singer on the CD named Sia. I looked at him with a smile and asked \\"Who?\\".He repeated her name. I was smiling because her name sounds exactly like what my sisters call me, although my name is Cecelia. It is written \\"Ceya\\" when they've written their version of my name. Needless to say to all who are reading this: THE GIRL AIN'T PLAYIN'!! She struck me like an open-hand slap when I heard her sing \\"You don't know me....\\" on the opening of REWRITE. I am a Black 46yr old female who may have lived every song on the CD. 'SUNDAY' has a rolling, lazy funk about it. 'NUMB' ain't lyin'....'THE CHURCH OF WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW' has Sia pleading \\"Go away yesterday\\" as if they're her last words. I just fell in love with her. I consider her a Master Wordsmith. She is a voice I find myself having to hear every day since buying this CD. She speaks to me. Oh! and I can't forget those fantabulous musicians who are doing a hellified job crafting those melodies. This Ceya LOVES Sia!!!
B000M3452Y|5.0|I think James Murphy has really tapped into the way it feels to be an aging hipster - which every hipster is. Being hip takes a lot of energy and every day you get less hip - just by getting a day older. His lyrics peer into this portal of social paranoia like J. Alfred Prufrock, obsessing \\"I grow old ... I grow old / I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled. / Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach? / I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach. But Murphy's beats herald that he is better than hip: He's at the top of his game.  <br /> <br />Hipness is constantly slipping from ones grasp - and for a lot of Gen-Xers they gave up the pursuit long ago to have a serious career or kids. Murphy never gave up to join \\"adulthood\\" - he lived in NYC for almost 20 years, gigging in every kind of band possible. He spent his 20s and 30s making music and trying to make it in the business, but failing. Many people would have taken a desk job and \\"gotten with reality,\\" but he was too hip for that, and it's paying off. Despite his recent success, he knows how it feels to be 35 and too cool to work 9-5, but disgusted by the trendy, silly vacuousness of 20-somethings. Many aging hipsters I know (myself not so much included) get bitter when they see the new crop of \\"hipsters,\\" and they go on and on and on about how much better it used to be: Sound of Silver's last track, \\"New York, I Love You But You're Bring Me Down\\" captures this sentiment perfectly. It is less bitter than LCD's first single, \\"Losing My Edge,\\" but Murphy is definitely bemoaning the loss of something hip and wonderful about New York that he now sees as gone. Or is it? Is it the aging hipster in him that is pointing fingers only because New York has changed and he hasn't? When he declares \\"Take me off your mailing list ,For kids that think it still exists,\\" he backs up the rub off by admitting \\"Maybe I'm wrong <br />/ And maybe you're right.\\" He is well aware of the fact that thoseyoung hipsters in Iowa or Portland or Birmingham, dreaming of idyllicly dirty NYC may still find what their looking for in the Big Apple - but maybe they won't. <br /> <br />Each song on the album has as much introspection - \\"New York, I Love You...\\" just happens to be the most lyrically well thought out and ballady. As a song, it's imperfect - Murphy just doesn't have a ballad-friendly voice (which is part of the appeal and irony of the song). I can imagine Weezer doing it real justice if they covered it. It is the anomaly on the album - the rest of the songs are all dancier. I think the rest of the songs are better, too, but if this song is the worst song on the album than I would say it's a near perfect album. <br /> <br />Definitely the best album as of April 5, 2007. If you have any taste whatsoever and are reading this stupid review, do yourself a favor and buy this album. Go see LCD live, while you're at it.

B000OY8NII|5.0|Welcome to EUREKA, the weirdest town in America, and also the title to the Sci-Fi Channel's inventive, breath of fresh air television series. Here's the set-up: When U.S. Marshal Jack Carter (Colin Ferguson) transports his rebellious, runaway daughter Zoey (Jordan Hinson) home in his custody, an auto accident lands him and his charge in Eureka, a top-secret, rustic town populated by eccentrics and genius scientists. Carter immediately becomes aware of Eureka's uniqueness as embodied in its odd residents who are more than they seem: an auto mechanic who's also a space shuttle engineer, a beautiful innkeeper who doubles as a psychotherapist, children who give intricate directions and who write mathematical formulas on the sidewalk...Added to the peculiar sights he witnesses, Carter's interest is further piqued when his offers to help the local constabulary in a missing child case is summarily rebuffed.<br /><br />In due course, he does learn the secret of Eureka, of which origin dates back to Albert Einstein and Harry S. Truman, who, after World War 2 and the scare of the atomic bomb, decided to build the tiny town as a safe haven and a workplace for our nation's greatest thinkers. In the fifty years of Eureka's existence, its residents have been hugely responsible for most of today's technological advances. But, of course, not everything can be a bonafide success. Global warming, for example, has been touted as one side effect of one experimental goof in Eureka. Sworn to secrecy, Jack Carter proves to be instrumental in resolving a horrific scientific project gone awry, impressing the powers-that-be enough that he ends up as the new Sheriff of Eureka.<br /><br />The series is colorfully flavored with a host of idiosyncratic characters effectively brought to life by a good cast: Carter's mutinous daughter Zoey (Jordan Hinson); the beautiful, gung-ho ex-Army Ranger and current Deputy Sheriff Josefina \\"Jo\\" Lupo (Erica Cerra, with whom I think I'm in love); Department of Defense agent Allison Blake (Salli Richardson-Whitfield), who toils as the government liaison between Eureka and the Pentagon and who, by the way, looks muy caliente in her pink undies; Nathan Stark (Ed Quinn), the icy, controlling head researcher of Global Dynamics and also Allison's husband; the insightful and sexy psychotherapist Beverly Barlowe (Debrah Farentino), who has dark secrets of her own; genial guy and mechanical genius Henry Deacon (Joe Morton), who slums as a car mechanic; the unstable Aussie Jim Taggart (Matt Frewer), the self-styled  \\"biological containment specialist\\"; and young Douglas Fargo (Neil Grayston), the bespectacled, sycophant computer geek. By the way, solely from a red-blooded dude's perspective, it's always appreciated when three gorgeous females are featured regularly in the same show, and Richardson-Whitfield, Farentino, and Cerra contribute in lifting EUREKA to new heights of must-see-TV-ness.<br /><br />Colin Ferguson's performance as Sheriff Jack Carter provides the bridge and the grounding point of view for the audience. As the witty, perceptive, and sometimes lost-at-sea Sheriff, he hits all the right notes here. His normal guy reactions to the endless slew of strangeness surrounding him are believable and, at times, hilarious. There's some nice verbal sparring (read: sexual tension) between Carter and Allison, but I particularly relish the chemistry *snicker* between Carter and his fully automated, hermetically sealed, very vocal military bunker/smart house, S.A.R.A.H.<br /><br />As a television series, EUREKA proved to be the highest-rated show on the Sci-Fi Channel of 2006, beating out the equally excellent, revamped BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. This exuberant show is equal parts X-FILES, TWILIGHT ZONE, STAR TREK and NORTHERN EXPOSURE in its playful quirkiness and forays into the weird; not to mention, the whistly, whimsical theme tune puts you immediately in sync with the show's oddball frequency.<br /><br />These are some of thetried and true sci-fi themes that are touched on: ESP, cloning, cell regeneration, mind manipulation, death rays, super speed, AIs, and nanotechnology. The laudable special effects are there when needed but do not overwhelm the show; the episodes are engrossing, if a bit warped at times, and the season's main story arc, involving the super  secret Section 5 and something called the Artifact, promises to go somewhere. I'm so glad the Sci-Fi Channel decided to renew this series for a second season. So, if you want to catch a show where crazy quantum physics regularly run amok, where wild inventions surface on a daily basis which are, by the way, gadgety cool enough to make even James Bond swoon, and where cheerleaders spout theorems and school nerds run the school, and also where the world is constantly threatened by the scientific lab toys of Eureka's brilliant but erratic personalities...well, then, yes, get your geek on and give EUREKA: SEASON ONE a whirl.tried and true sci-fi themes that are touched on: ESP, cloning, cell regeneration, mind manipulation, death rays, super speed, AIs, and nanotechnology.

B000J103PC|3.0|This movie is not a tragedy, a comedy, a drama,a parody, or even a satire although it comes close at times.  It seems to be a cross between a Docudrama and a Docu-satire.  Meryl Streep's performance is excellent and her scene as she announces her divorce raises her performance to its well deserved Oscar nomination.  The screen play does an excellent job of portraying the attitude of entitlement displayed by many top executives as Streep treats her employees as her personal servants.  She is a driven executive that has no life outside of her job and doesn't expect her employees to have one either -- they are there to serve her.  Like most senior executives she is ruthless, self-absorbed, and acts only in her own self-interest.  While this movie accurately describes my experience with senior executives the movie doesn't accurately portray the end game.  Ann Hatheway's character is living in a dingy apartment with some scuzzy guy who looks like he hasn't bathed in six months.  As she climbs the ladder and is exposed to the rich and powerful she is transformed into a player.  This is very logical and it happens but in the end she throws this away and goes back to the unkempt and unhygenic loser.  This was totally unrealistic.  I liked the movie but only gave it three stars because it fell apart at the end.  Once a player -- always a player.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|I thought this was a good film when I saw it in the theatre & was pleased to find a used DVD copy in the budget bin.  The DVD doesn't offer much extra in the one disc version other than brief comments by Steven Spielberg about the film's relation to the history.  To me, the film was a psychological thriller more than an action picture.<br /><br />Australian actor Eric Bana who started out in comedy & became known for pictures like \\"Black Hawk Down\\" & \\"Troy\\" does a good job as Avner, the Mossad agent who is given the task of eliminating those who planned the Munich Olympic games massacre.  His breakdown into near madness and paranoia as the film progresses is well done, but seems to occur suddenly without really seeing him unravel.  I guess the discovery of Carl's nude corpse in the hotel room was supposed to send him over the edge.  It'll be interesting to see him as a gambler in \\"Lucky You\\" with Drew Barrymore & Robert Duval.<br /><br />Australian actor Geoffrey Rush won his Oscar for \\"Shine\\" in 1996 and was twice more nominated for \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" & \\"Quills.\\"  As Ephraim, he's the counter-intelligence mastermind who coordinates all these activities.<br /><br />Daniel Craig, after numerous films like \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,\\" \\"The Jacket,\\" & \\"Layer Cake,\\" finally became known as Double-O-7 James Bond in \\"Casino Royale,\\" for which he received a Best Actor nomination from the British Academy Awards.  As Steve, he does a good job of making it all the way through the movie, flying into action mode when required.  His blue eyes exude an intensity and focus that lifts the film.<br /><br />Mathieu Kossovitz plays Robert the bomb maker who can never quite get the charges right.  First they're not strong enough; next too strong.  He won a Best Supporting Actor award for \\"Munich\\" from the National Association of Film Critics.  He is also known as a director.  He directed \\"Gothika\\" with Halle Berry and won the Cannes Best Director Award for \\"La haine\\" (Hate).  As an actor, he's played in films like \\"Amelie\\" and \\"Birthday Girl\\" with Nicole Kidman.  He does a nice job as the klutzy often-berated toy maker who has been tapped to be the bomber.<br /><br />Irish Actor Ciran Hinds has a diverse number of films under his belt from \\"The Weight of Water\\" (which I reviewed as \\"The Weight of Editing\\") to \\"Oscar & Lucinda\\" & \\"Miami Vice.\\"  He also played in \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\" with Daniel Craig.  As Carl, he wears glasses and voices skepticism about the project and the authenticity of the intelligence on which they are acting.  His demise is a turning point in the film as we learn that the hunters are now also the hunted.<br /><br />Other roles are also nicely done.  Hanns Ziscler appears as Hans in his 69th film.  Ayelet Zurer as Avner's wife Daphna does a nice job of being the brave mother & spouse.  Lynn Cohen, whose first film was Woody Allen's \\"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\\" does a convincing and controlled portrayal of Golda Meir.  Israeli actress Gila Almazor who won the Silver Bear Best Actress Award from the Berlin International Film Festival for \\"The Summer of Avia\\" in 1989 & does a good job as Avner's mother who urges him to avenge the villains for all of their ancestors.  French actors Michael Lonsdale who was in the first \\"Day of the Jackal\\" (1973) & another film I like very much, \\"Ronin,\\" does a good job as the wise Papa who trades information to feed his family.  Mathieu Amalric plays his son Louis who acts as the go-between with Avner.<br /><br />\\"Munich\\" won the Best Picture Award from the American Film Institute.  It was nominated for 5 Oscars for Best Picture, Best Original Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director & Best Editing.  While it is a long film, it is one that pulls me in and keeps me glued to the screen.  It was a moving cinematic adventure.  Enjoy!).

As Carl, he wears glasses and voices skepticism about the project and the authenticity of the intelligence on which they are acting.  His demise is a turning point in the film as we learn that the hunters are now also the hunted. <br /> <br />Other roles are also nicely done.  Hanns Ziscler appears as Hans in his 69th film.  Ayelet Zurer as Avner's wife Daphna does a nice job of being the brave mother & spouse.  Lynn Cohen, whose first film was Woody Allen's \\"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\\" does a convincing and controlled portrayal of Golda Meir.  Israeli actress Gila Almazor who won the Silver Bear Best Actress Award from the Berlin International Film Festival for \\"The Summer of Avia\\" in 1989 & does a good job as Avner's mother who urges him to avenge the villains for all of their ancestors.  French actors Michael Lonsdale who was in the first \\"Day of the Jackal\\" (1973) & another film I like very much, \\"Ronin,\\" does a good job as the wise Papa who trades information to feed his family.  Mathieu Amalric plays his son Louis who acts as the go-between with Avner.   <br /> <br />\\"Munich\\" won the Best Picture Award from the American Film Institute.  It was nominated for 5 Oscars for Best Picture, Best Original Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director & Best Editing.  While it is a long film, it is one that pulls me in and keeps me glued to the screen.  It was a moving cinematic adventure.  Enjoy! <br />
B00006L3S3|5.0|This album is arguably Mr. Lennon's best. I'm not going to shove my opinions down your throat, but I shall tell you why I believe that this is possibly John's loveliest collection. <br /> <br />\\"Mind Games,\\" \\"Aisumasen,\\" and \\"Out The Blue\\" are all sparkling love songs. The title track, perhaps best known, is totally exotic and cool. One of the best songs John ever wrote. <br /> <br />However, don't buy this CD just for \\"Mind Games\\"! This album ranks with the most thoroughly listenable in existence. From the sense of purpose that permeates \\"I Know (I Know)\\" and \\"You Are Here,\\" uplifting the listener with every lyric, to the advice softly given by \\"One Day (At A Time)\\" and \\"Bring On The Lucie (Freda Peeple),\\" Lennon really delivers heart. <br /> <br />This CD release was worth it, too, for it has more of John Lennon's awesomely expressive drawings in the booklet as well as two great extra \\"home versions\\" (with the last one being a little annoying...but still good). <br /> <br />I also love the silence reserved for Nutopia that is included. Let us all take the time to belong in Paradise together. We CAN bring World Peace if we want it; if give of ourselves benevolently to everyone. AND WE WANT WORLD PEACE NOW! <br /> <br />I guarantee that everyone will like at least SOMETHING about MIND GAMES. After all, people do have ears. The music is less than twenty dollars, which is spectacular! (Considering that the pieces are all priceless.)
0783225482|5.0|I have loved this movie for years...it is always in the top 5 of my favorite movies, maybe even the top 3...Bruce Willis, who generally is not a funny guy, is hilarious in his turn as a washed-up, alcoholic Hollywood plastic surgeon, and Meryl Streep was never funnier, playing a has-been looks-obsessed movie star, and of course Goldie Hawn is a natural at comedy.  If you haven't seen this movie you have to rent or buy it, you will laugh as hard the twentieth time you see it as you did the first time you saw it.
1582701709|5.0|I am a full believer that you attract your happiness.  This book has provided insight to me in more ways than imaginable.  In fact, my girlfriends and I have decided we should even have weekly \\"Secret\\" meetings.  I've had this book for a few weeks now, and already my outlook on life, me, relationships and money have all changed.  I'm finding happiness, good things are happening to me.  I recommend this book to anyone that would like to break the cycle, and start forming your new life today.  The law of attraction is so powerful; you just need to learn how to use it.  We all have the ability.
B00005JPGO|4.0|Blood Diamond tells the story of the turmoil that erupted during the late 1990s in Africa surrounding the trafficking of illegal diamonds. The story is told from three different points of view. Djimon Honsou, as an African man whose family is torn apart because of the turmoil. He is forced to work in a diamond mine while his wife and children are spread across Africa by the corrupt rebels. Leonardo DiCaprio, as the jewel smuggler who figures why not make a quick buck even at the expense of the continent he grew up in, since everyone else seeems inclined to do so. And Jennifer Connelly, as an American journalist who is eager to spread the word of the conflict so that it gets more widespread attention and the flow of these \\"blood diamonds\\" will stop. As Connelly's character says, \\"People back home wouldn't buy a diamond if they knew it cost someone else their hand.\\" Or maybe they would. Blood Diamond is a story about good and evil, right and wrong, black and white. It's a story of opposites and how different people react to crisis situations. It was entertaining, to say the least, and action-packed and exciting the whole way through. It also had a strong message, solid direction, and a great cast. As other reviewers have noted, the African continent endured war long before the trade of conflict diamonds became worldwide news, but the fact remains that there are many people in the world who probably didn't, and still don't, know much about it. Blood Diamond attempts to shed light on an important issue, and it did so with elegance and precision. I would definitely recommend it, but would add that warning that it is in no way a light film that you will watch and forget. It's message resonates, and will stay with you for days later. BUt I think that was the point.
044661758X|3.0|I have always liked Michael Connelly's writing, so I was very much looking forward to sitting down with this one.  Perhaps it was the subject matter, but I found this book particularly disturbing.  I did like the storytelling...it kept me on the edge of my seat as Connelly always does.  But, when I finished reading the book I wanted to burn it and then go take a two hour shower.  As I said, I think the subject matter is just to disturbing for the likes of me.  I'll go out and buy the next Michael Connelly as soon as it comes out, though!
B0007WZXAS|4.0|Good, mellow music that grows on you. Not his best work ever IMO, but some quality works in Amused to Death, Perfect Sense, & Miracle. A great addition to any PF collection.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I had no idea that any of Donner's footage remained.<br /><br />Yes, I followed the whole dirty business between the Salkinds<br /><br />and Donner, so the idea that ANY of this film remained was<br /><br />fanciful at best.<br /><br />Being a life-long Superman fan, naturally I looked[[ASIN:B000IJ79WU Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut]] at this box with amazment and excitement.<br /><br />After all these years, Donner's vision, Mankowitz' script, and the real prequel to Superman Returns, was released by Warners, possibly as an afterthought and marketing tool for \\"returns\\".<br /><br />When I saw the film, I was blown away by the additions, happy about the subtractions, and I felt \\"closure\\" for Chris Reeve.<br /><br />The story, while basicaly the same, is told in a much more exciting manner. There is NO doubt in this addition that Lois & Superman were intimate, setting up Lois' kid in \\"Returns\\".<br /><br />Overall, it is a better paced film than Lester's. It's a better sequel than Lester's. It's a better directed film than Lester's. The pre-credit sequence, along WITH the credit sequence, are better than Lester's.<br /><br />Now, just in case you get the idea that I don't like Richard Lester as a director, you should know that I loved \\"Help\\", and \\"A Hard Day's Night\\"[[ASIN:B000B6WXQ2 The Beatles: The Making Of A Hard Day's Night]].<br /><br />But his comedic elements did not belong in a sequel who's original took the Superman Legend seriously.
B000O178BY|5.0|1st listen through I liked it.    5th listen through, I love it!    The one thing this Album reminds me of is \\"Mezzanine\\" by Massive Attack. While it sounds DISTINCTLY NIN I just get a Massive Attack vibe from it, and that is a very good thing, most of the songs are mid-tempo very bassy, very electronic. The album really tells a story, its amazing.    Standout Tracks:    The Good Soldier/Vessel (play them as one song)    Capital G (Very poppy and groove sounding)    The Great Destroyer (Awesome, the song literally gets destroyed halfway through)    Another Version of the Truth (A good sad track)    Zero Sum (Best ending track I have heard in a long time)      Those were just some of my favorites, but honestly to tell you the truth, almost NONE of the songs on the album were fillers, they were ALL great, some of Reznor's best work since the Fragile. (I personally feel as if The Downward Spiral is a little overrated [most NIN fans would kill me for saying so])
B000050FEN|5.0|Se7en is a dark portrayal of a genius psychopath killer, brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey. He is on camera for no more than last 30 minutes of the movie, but so dominant is his character that the entire movie seems to be cast around his uncanny-ness. The hero of the movie though is neither he nor Brad Pitt nor Morgan Freeman - the two detectives entrusted with the task of tracking him down. It is the plot and the script, extremely brilliant though very murky and enticingly morbid. You see gory murders that leave trace of heart-rending torture, but all that it makes you do is become more inquisitive about the killer. The killer is the sole obsession with the detectives too and the contrast between Brad Pitt's edginess and Morgan Freeman's poise is very well portrayed. It parallels the contrast between the killer's poise and the edginess of the action sequence.<br /><br />The climax of the movie is startling, revealing and disturbing. It characterizes the essence of Se7en, a movie that stirs you and makes you sit up and take note of it. Calling Se7en a psychological thriller is understating its significance. It is a movie that goes well beyond that, making you aware of the morbid possibilities that exist in human mind. The movie is also remarkable for the fact the cinematic climax does not provide you any catharsis, it just sets your mind thinking.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles frolicked in every conceivable pop style in one master opus. The White Album is among the finest examples of the 'Album' as work of art; more than a collection of undeniable songs, which it is, The White Album is an experience when swallowed whole.  <br /> <br />Certainly not all albums are, nor 'ought to be,' created or ingested as unified works - despite what the anti-digital-download purists may suggest). Nevertheless, while every track on The White Album is stunning in its own right, the album is an absolute killer when consumed end to end.

B000002504|5.0|I like Gentle Giant and do give 5 stars to all of the mid-period recordings. If you own several other Gentle Giant CD's then go ahead and get this one also. <br /> <br />If you are looking for your first GG CD, don't start here. This is a very heavy album that is a more satisfying listen after you've gotten used to the Gentle Giant sound. IMPO: You should start with Free Hand!!!, Power and the Glory or 3 Friends (which is more of a classic progressive Rock album). If you hate any of these albums, don't go any futher. <br /> <br />I consider this album to be a masterpiece as well as In a Glass House, Power and the Glory, Free Hand, 3 Friends and Interview. This is thoughtful intersting music! <br /> <br />
B00005JLIU|4.0|This is not exactly a \\"family movie\\" which is perfect for adults that enjoy adult humor, but shun violence, sex, and violence. Surprisingly enough, there are a few explitives in this \\"G\\" rated movie. Carol Channing is intoxicating as the pleasure seeking widow. This is a must see for those who miss the glamour of \\"old time\\" films. The costumes, dance numbers and song are all in fun along with the story line.
1594200823|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  I was disgusted by many parts, apalled by many parts and fascinated by all.  To say the least I have changed my eating habits and my interest in where the food I eat comes from forever.   I would recommend for ... well, anyone that eats!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|The cd is great. The harmonies are wonderful. I recommend their other cds.
B0009MAP9A|5.0|This album was originally released in 1964 and the messages are as true today as they were then. The third title in this album, \\"With God on our side\\", was never included on any of the Greatest Hits releases, and its only other release was in a 1995 live album. It is sad to note that the civil rights activism and anti war passions of the 60's do not exist today. Everyone needs to listen to this song especially the political leaders of the world. The last verse of the song is the most memorable: <br /> <br />\\"So now as I'm Leavin' <br />I'm weary as Hell <br />The confusion I'm feelin' <br />Ain't no tongue can tell <br />The words fill my head  <br />And fall to the floor <br />If God's on our side <br />He'll stop the next war\\" <br />
0385336691|4.0|The Hard Way is Lee Child's 10th novel featuring Jack Reacher, the ex-Army MP, drifter, and finder of trouble, a character many this series' fans have come to enjoy.  The Hard Way finds Reacher minding his own business in a New York City coffee shop when a man approaches him about a car he might have seen leave from across the street the night before.  The next thing you know Reacher is meeting with Edward Lane, who hires him to find his kidnapped wife and step-daughter and their kidnapper.  But Lane has a history.  He is the head of a group of soldiers for hire and as usual, things aren't always as they seem.  And Lane certainly gets more than he paid for in Reacher, who will find the truth, even if he has to do it the hard way! <br /> <br />As a mystery The Hard Way works quite well as Reacher tries to unravel the kidnapping, and it has plenty of twists of turns that keep Reacher and the reader on their toes.  There is not as much hard core violence and action in this Reacher novel as in others, nor is it needed.  The story moves at a brisk, entertaining pace and avoids the pitfalls of some of the previous novels that become farfetched and unbelievable.   <br /> <br />If you are a fan mystery fan or a Reacher fan, this is a book to reach for.
B00005JOCS|4.0|\\"Dreamgirls,\\" originally a hit Broadway production in the 1980s, is a lavish musical inspired by the history of Motown and its super group The Supremes. Like the songs in \\"Grace of My Heart\\" which is clearly based on the career of Carole King, the soundtrack music of \\"Dreamgirls,\\" good as it is, can't match the power of the real Motown sound. Actually the film's musical numbers hardly sound like Motown Sound, but still some of them are real showstoppers thanks to the film's gifted stars, especially the dynamic singing voice of Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson. <br /> <br />In \\"Dreamgirls\\" you should not expect much from the story, which runs a familiar course of superstars or celebrities, with the meteoric rise of three R&B singers (played by Beyoncé Knowles, Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose) to the fame and their subsequent troubles and ego-clashing within the members and their shrewd, business-minded producer/manager (Jamie Foxx). It is a same old story you have heard somewhere else in gossip magazines. . <br /> <br />Once the three girls' dreams come true with the glitter of showbiz, it takes the center of their lives, and once it does, none of the characters are allowed to breathe much. Anika Noni Rose and Danny Glover are not given enough time for their characters, and even the role of Beyoncé Knowles is not fleshed out satisfactorily. Eddie Murphy is outstanding as a popular singer and ladies' man named James \\"Thunder\\" Early (with a haircut like Little Richard's), but there is nothing new in Thunder's story about his love affair and fading stardom. <br /> <br />Still I enjoyed watching \\"Dreamgirls\\". I know it has lots of shortcomings, and I hear the complaints from the fans of the original stage (which I haven't seen). Yes, I know. Perhaps the number of the film's shortcomings depends on each viewer's taste or expectations, and I liked the filmed version of \\"Dreamgirls\\" for what it is. I like it for its entertainment values such as gorgeous costumes, beautifully staged live scenes and cinematography, plus the powerful, emotionally-charged songs by Jennifer Hudson, all of which compensate for the lack of a better story.
B000M341QO|5.0|It has been a long time since i saw such a great movie. This movie was excellent. Keeps you interested from beginning to end. There are also surprises which is great. Must see film.
6305907145|4.0|I found I did enjoy this movie, even though the director took liberties. It doesn't follow so much the novel by Jane Austen, but if you haven't read the book and are unable to do the comparisons, this movie is enjoyable. I gave 4 stars because of the liberties taken by the director, but did like what I saw.
0316010669|5.0|How many people have told you to trust your gut? So many that it probably got annoying after a while, especially when you had to make a very important decision and thought your gut was unreliable.  This book explains when to trust your gut and when not to.  It's fascinating and Malcolm Gladwell does a great job of weaving fun and relevant examples into the text in order to make his point.  The only problem with it is that, just as you are convinced that your gut is your therapist, best friend and the greatest advice-giver ever, you read the final few chapters of the book that warn about trusting your gut when you are biased or have a prior experience that throws your gut off and skews your decision-making ability.  This can be confusing and might leave some people back at square one asking - is my gut right or is it biased and therefore unreliable? Still, it's worth reading.  It's way better than the book that came after it - THINK.  You must give this book to every slow decision-maker in your life.  They'll thank you for it.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|I always felt the best way to listen to this album was driving around with the windows down and BLASTING this sucker.  Yes, even Desolation Row.  Blonde on Blonde was also genius, but this one had such unbridled energy and freedom just pouring out of it, Dylan just sounds so loose and wild with his words whereas Blonde (and the albums after it) seemed more mannered and deliberately \\"poetic.\\"  This one is definitely a \\"deserted island\\" one for me---it would be in my top 10 albums to have with me if I was ever lost at sea.  Long live Bob!

1416914285|5.0|So, I've finished City of Bones - and I just want to say that it was everything I thought it was going to be: an amazing, intricate story that keeps you on the edge of your seat, biting your fingernails.  <br /> <br />God - where to begin? I loved the twist, of course, but more than that I loved the clues which were placed along the way. There were just enough of them (the lock of blond hair, the mention of Jace's hair color, that Jocelyn and Valentine were supposedly dead) so that revealed over time, it seemed almost coincidental. But, of course, nothing is coincidence, right?  <br /> <br />The Characters. I loved them all. Simon who is just there, along for the ride, because he loves Clary and he doesn't want to lose her and be left behind. Jace with his daddy issues and his Shadowhunter Code. Isabelle who's always been around boys and doesn't really know what to do with Clary, how to react to her. Alec who has had to take care of Jace and rely on him and protect him. The dynamic between Isabelle and Alec and Jace is amazing - it's no wonder they react to Simon and Clary the way that they do. It's only ever been the three of them and they've had to battle demons for God's sake - no wonder they're as close as they are. And I loved the contrast between their relationship and Simon and Clary's relationship. There's something more open about Simon and Clary's friendship in spite of the fact that they don't spend as much time together as Isabelle, Jace and Alec do. Simon is able to tell Clary that he loves her - Alec can't even admit to himself he loves Jace, it seems. And Jace isn't able to tell Isabelle and Alec about Hodge's betrayal but Clary tells Simon everything about what happened - including that Jace is her brother.  <br /> <br />And, of course, there is the plot. More than what's going on now, presently, there is an entire back story that is just as interesting and just as important as Clary's journey now. It's an amazing secondary world the author has created - with demon-fueled motorcycles and portals to other worlds - but, possibly what I love about this the most is that it's taken this secondary world and meshed it together with real life. Feeling like you don't really know your parents, like maybe there is more to the story then they've told you - who doesn't go through that? I loved the beginning when Clary is out with Simon and her mother is calling and she let's it go to voice mail. Who hasn't been in her place? By including moments like these the author has made it even more possible to become lost in her world. <br /> <br />This novel is more than a novel - it's an experience, an adventure you don't even need to leave your house for.  <br /> <br />I really can't say enough good things about this. I just want to give it the biggest compliment I can - this inspired me to write. I'm sure you know that there is no better feeling than reading a wonderful book and having the need to do it for yourself - to write lines like \\"I said his poetry was terrible. It sounds like he ate a dictionary and started vomiting up words at random\\" or moments like Clary and Jace share at the end.  <br />  <br />Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <br /> <br />
055358202X|2.0|He wouldn't have had to split the book in 2 volumes if he'd just edited out oh... about 2/3 of the book.  So much backstory, so much history of characters we'd never heard of before and don't care about...
B0002HDT9A|3.0|Timeline is an adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel about a team of <br />archaeologists who end up back in the period of history of the place they <br />are excavating.  Having read the novel, I found the movie dissappointing. <br />I liked the movie but only because of the romance between Gerard Butler <br />and Lady Claire.  He solely seemed to grasp the essence of the role and <br />became the part of Andre Marek.  The rest of the cast never seemed to get it. <br />Richard Donner has directed some very entertaining movies, perhaps this just isnt his genre.
0374105235|5.0|EXCELLENT!! I highly recommend this book to everyone.  It was terrible to hear what this boy had to go through but I think it's important to be aware of what's going on in our world.  This book and the movie Blood Diamond definitely opened my eyes to situations that are incredibly horrifying in Africa. To read in detail how Ishmeal Beah survived such adversity and trauma was very sad, yet inspirational. I saw Ishmeal on a talk show and was EXTREMELY impressed with him. He's truely a special person. It's quite disheartening how the rest of the world will allow these awful situations to continue for these people in Africa.
B00005JPFQ|4.0|Well, I've only read a few Ghost Rider comics and those where crossovers from other comic books.  But I always thought he was a cool character so I was excited about the movie coming out.  I thought Nick Cage was perfect for the role, and he did a good job playing Blaze.  The only issue frankly I had with the film, as with most action or comic fantasy films is with character development.  I could've used  a little more depth into Blaze's relationship with his father and his friends, and Roxanne.  His inner demons so to speak, just more substance that's all.  Otherwise, the graphics and Demons were cool.  But A clearer idea of their intentions would have been better.  Why were the souls in the TexMex town so important?  Why was there beef between Daddy-devil and Son of satan?  Tell us script-writers?  That's basically the problem: when and if they make a sequel, which they undoubtably will since it fared well in the box-office.  They need a better more indepth script, otherwise the formula is there IMO.  I thought Eva M was fine, as Roxanne.  Too bad they killed off Sam Elliot, because Johnny needs a mentor.  But this is comics, bring him back?  They brought back Whislter in Blade...So for all its script issues, I still give it 4 stars.
0743298020|5.0|In this marvelous novel, Setterfield evokes the flavor of 19th century literature with a twisting tale of mystery and secrets written in a style reminiscent of Dickens or Henry.  The narrator is Margaret Lea, the spinster daughter of a London bookseller who devotes her time and energy to the books that she loves so much.  Margaret who writes biographies is summoned to the side of the great and popular Vida Winter.  The charismatic and mysterious author has spent a lifetime evading personal revelations by offering up dubious tales of her childhood and her history.  But now that Ms. Winter is dying she is finally ready to reveal her true origins and she has selected Margaret to assume the task of writing Vida's biography.  For Vida's birth and childhood are tales of mental instability, unnatural family relations and despair involving the once prominent family of a rural village.  As Vida slowly unfurls her story, Margaret is fascinated by the parallels to the secret of her own birth which involved a conjoined twin who died when she was separated from Margaret's side.  \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is more than a novel, it is a valentine to reading.  To Margaret, books are more important than people.  \\"As one tends the graves of the dead, so I tend the books.  I clean them, do minor repairs, keep them in good order. \\" Although the story is supposedly set in contemporary times, there are no cell phones, no computers.  Margaret's research into the truth of Vida's stories is done in dusty libraries with census books and  other enduring records.  It is a spell-binding story, filled with fascinating and tragic characters.
B00004TVV1|5.0|I can't image why these two CDs are rarely listed under essential to a well rounded jazz collection. The two greatest jazz masters unite along with Young,Bigard, Herbert and Barcelona, who are also wonderful.

Plus, we get to listen in on the false starts and the conversations between takes!
055358202X|2.0|The fourth volume in Martin's epic fantasy is a frustrating and disappointing novel because most of the characters readers have come to love are off-stage.  Only at the end of 1100 pages does Martin confide that he deliberately focuses on characters such as Jamie and Cersei in this volume.  Where is Dany?  Where is Tyrion?  Why does Catelyn Stark appear only briefly as a disfigured, silent harridan without even a page from her point of view?  Instead, this volume focuses on the escalating disintegration of the Seven Kingdoms as Queen Cersei, regent for the king, her timid 9-year -old son, solidifies her power base by placing weak and easily controlled men in key positions.  When her brother, Jamie spurns her offer to share the power, Cersei uses her wiles to manipulate and destroy all rivals.  The Starks are noticeably absent from this volume except for a few token chapters about Arya, who has adopted a new identity as a street urchin selling fish.  This entire volume feels superfluous; introducing characters and storylines that seem pointless --- and --- even worse --- uninteresting.  Martin seems to have succumbed to the disease that fells many fantasy writers: an unwillingness to bring a story to its logical conclusion and let go.  The unending tale grows wearisome.
B00008EY7H|1.0|The show itself is pretty typical cirque, some great acts and some terrible camera work/editing.  But this one you can't even control the disc.

B00004T1NA|5.0|After the gigantic strides of \\"Stupid Dream\\", Porcupine Tree have successfully released a follow up that really delivers. It is like \\"Wish you were here\\" following \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", meaning: If you loved the 1st Album, you will also love this one. The opening track \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" is a great start in the same vain as \\"Evenless\\" was on Stupid Dream and features a classic Lead solo from Steve on the guitar. My favourite tracks on this album, as with Stupid Dream, are the softer tracks (i.e. The rest will flow/She's moved on and Last Chance.. for example). The harmonies,again, are beautiful and as always, the songwriting is top-drawer. I highly recommend this album, though recent converts to Porc Tree might be disappointed after the likes of \\"In Absentia\\", \\"Deadwing\\" and the just released \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" which get heavier with each release. I have ALL Of Porcupine Tree's CDs, and this rates as one of my favourites. Who knows what genre of music Steve and Co. will release next time, but one thing is for certain, it will be of the highest quality.

It is exactly what Gaiman is describing:  the ancient gods are in America but are reduced due to lack of belief in them.  But a storm is coming and they must stand and fight or fall forever.<br /><br />Drawn into this is the recently paroled and widowed Shadow, a man with shadowy motivations and an unknown past.  He accepts work from Mr. Wednesday (Odin, from Wodin's Day) as an errand boy and quickly meets the Russian equivalents of the Norse Norns, Kali, and a voodoo god, too.<br /><br />Even though I have only finished 25% so far I highly recommend this book.

B0004Z33EG|4.0|There is a certain amount of cheese to this film, without a doubt, but it doesn't approach the crazy, over the top ridiculousness of the sequels. Plus, it is a film with something to say about the Vietnam vet experience. The message is pretty simplistic, I grant, but worlds deeper than, again, anything in the sequels. It also imparts this message with a minimum of fuss, and without slowing down the story. Good action, decent performances. (Though, upon re-watching, Richard Crenna's performance as Rambo's former commander is very, very odd.) See Rambo when he still had some complexity, and before he became a superhero.
1582701709|3.0|The real genius of this book is in the marketing and packaging. The Secret has created incredible buzz. (A couple of plugs on Oprah never hurts, either!)  In any event, the information in this book is far from new, but it's packaged in a way that's easy to digest.  If you're into positive thinking and the law of attraction, The Secret offers some fresh perspective in an easy read.  As a marketing case study, the secret to The Secret is all about the buzz.

B000N3SS80|1.0|To be honest, I laughed in disdain when I heard that Jennifer Lopez was releasing an all-Spanish language album.  Granted, she does have talent as she is a decent actress.  However, she does not possess any talent as far as music is concerned.  Bottom line:  She is no Gloria Estefan, who will forever be the reigning Queen of Latin Pop.  Since Celia Cruz's passing, Estefan has held the thrown as the modern queen of Latin music.  When Lopez first burst onto the music scene, she received the comparison that she would be the new Gloria.  Sorry, that will never happen.    For one, Lopez is not a native Spanish speaker, nor does she write any songs.  Her voice is extremely limited, and although she may have improved some, it is far from being Gloria or Selena-quality.  Jennifer may be respected as an actress (with fair reason, too), though she is seen as a laughingstock in the music industry.  \\"Como Ama Una Mujer\\" will never been seen as a classic.  Now, \\"Mi Tierra\\" by Ms. Estefan is a classic, being the greatest-selling Latin album in music history.    Why has Gloria held the title of Latin pop queen for 20-plus years?  The answer is blatantly obvious.    I much rather Jennifer stick to acting and dancing, which is her more her territory.  She will never be recognized as a true artist.  If it wasn't for Marc Anthony, excellent salsa crooner and husband to Ms. Lopez, this album never would've been born.    If anything, this album will sell due to the status Jennifer Lopez possesses, not because of her or the album's musicianship.

0060557818|5.0|Richard Mayhew, a quiet, rather mundane man, finds an injured young woman on a London street.  She's reluctant to be helped, but he seeks to restore her to health anyway.  The appearance of two mysterious men seeking her brings an immediate tension, little helped by the woman's apparent disappearance.  When she re-emerges from wherever she'd hidden, it begins a string of amazing adventures.  The young woman, \\"Door\\" seems to possess bizarre  powers as she leads Richard into a new, wholly unanticipated realm - below the city's streets.<br /><br />Although Door is on a quest that would place Richard, and herself, in grave danger, she leads him through this bizarre society.  She's young, vulnerable and clearly frightened.  It doesn't matter that she's from a respected family.  They have all been slaughtered and Door's protectors are few.  They aren't always effective, either.  As a newcomer to this world, Richard is not placed to act as the fantasy hero.  Gaiman paints him admirably, a terrified city man who yet manages the flash of courage and insight.  More importantly, Richard Mayhew cares, and the novelty of that feeling in this environment proves strangely beneficial.<br /><br />Gaiman's prose gifts, combined with a vivid imagination, have produced a sterling example of \\"modern\\" fantasy.  What does lie below the congested streets of Britain's capital?  Gaiman proposes a mix of ancient spirits and semi-human beings who have formed societies, alliances, meeting places and residences.  There are those who communicate with the rats, a major population segment, as expected.  The author creates an amazing melange of figures, including, even at these depths, an angel.  Among the most important aspect of this realm is the Floating Market.  Never fixed in time or place, the Market provides a location for exchanges of services as well as goods.  The bustle and chaos of any large bazaar are present, as is an element of peace.  When the Market is running, there is the Market Truce, protecting the innocent and malign alike.  With many of Gaiman's characters bent on exterminating their fellows for a wide variety of reasons, this haven is essential.<br /><br />This complex tale mixes elements of ancient legend, modern business dealings and some innovative aspects.  The combination keeps the reader's attention firmly captured as you are led through a string of the unexpected.  Friends betray and enemies become allies - before shifting back again.  The true hero is a woman - a self-appointed guardian who expects no reward but acknowledgement of duty properly exercised.  This is a fantasy land, but the telephone becomes a significant element.  There is a background manipulator of events who remains enigmatic to the end.  With all these aspects carefully depicted and developed, Neverwhere will remain a major work in the fantasy genre, while sustaining its unique qualities.

B000G759LW|4.0|In my opinion, Christina Aguilera never had a bad album (a bad PROPER album, anyway; I never heard Mi Riflejo or My Kind of Christmas, so I can't comment on them). But each album seemed to be a tad better than the last. She took a very long break after her second album Stripped (probably to get married and concentrate on the first stages of THAT), but she still managed to make a modest comeback with Back to Basics.<br /><br />This album is a double-disc because, I guess, Christina wanted to make up for lost time between album releases (or maybe she realized that separating the work is sometimes best; after all, Stripped clocked in at 78 minutes). But each disc seems like it takes its own form, as disc one is primarily produced by DJ Premier, while Linda Perry handles disc two. This accounts for why there is a more hip-hop-flavored feel to the first disc, upon which produces such highlights as \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" and \\"Without You\\".<br /><br />Disc 2, which appears to follow a circus theme, would probably have to be the stronger of the discs though. Not that Disc 1 is bad, but I just have more favorites on the second disc. One song that immediately jumps out is \\"I Got Trouble\\" (the song that was used at the beginning and end of the \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" video), and for some reason I was surprised to learn that that song isn't a cover. And Christina also shows her sensual side on her latest single \\"Candyman\\", which is immediately followed by the even more detailed \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\".<br /><br />This two-disc set isn't without its flaws, however. I don't know if I'd say there are any truly \\"bad\\" songs, but there ARE a few weak selections. For example, \\"Back In the Day\\" features too much sampling and not enough singing. \\"Still Dirrty\\" doesn't go anywhere, and while it's unfortunate the way Christina's father treated her and her mother, I'm not sure it's necessary to mention that on every album (see \\"Oh Mother\\"). Finally, the necessary dedication to fans, \\"Thank You\\", is mostly an unstructured collection of fan-made voicemail messages; in addition, a song like that would fit better at the end of the final disc, not the first disc.<br /><br />But there are enough good songs to overshadow the questionable ones; and anyway, 4 errors out of a 23-song album is definitely no cause for alarm. Back to Basics just shows that Christina is still continuing her exceptional skills, so pick it up if you haven't already.<br /><br />Anthony Rupertu\\", is mostly an unstructured collection of fan-made voicemail messages; in addition, a song like that would fit better at the end of the final disc, not the first disc. <br /> <br />But there are enough good songs to overshadow the questionable ones; and anyway, 4 errors out of a 23-song album is definitely no cause for alarm.

B000002L99|4.0|THE BAND: Eddie Van Halen (lead & rhythm guitars, keyboards), Sammy Hagar (vocals, rhythm guitars), Michael Anthony (bass), Alex Van Halen (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1986) 11 tracks clocking in at approximately 43 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page booklet containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, 1 black & white band photo, and thank you's. Recorded at 5150 Studios (Eddie Van Halen's home studio in Los Angeles). Label - Warner Bros.<br /><br />COMMENTS: If you asked me, I'd tell you the David Lee Roth era of VH had pretty much peaked with \\"1984\\". Along with \\"1984\\", Van Halen's amazing 1978 debut are, to date, still the only VH releases to achieve \\"Diamond\\" status (10+ million units sold). Decades later, I still wish Eddie and David Lee Roth could have worked things out (Eddie wanting to do guitar work outside VH, and DLR's infantile antics were the main reasons for each pointing the finger). In my opinion, all of the VH releases from the DLR era are classics (with the exception of perhaps \\"Diver Down\\"). The DLR era Van Halen albums were straight ahead hard rock (guitars, bass, drums, and a helleva singer) - the way it was meant to be. The exception being \\"1984\\" when Eddie introduced the keyboards. Exit David Lee Roth (April 1985), and enter Sammy Hagar. Sammy's proven himself over the years with Montrose, HSAS, several songs on movie soundtracks, and his many solo albums. A good rock singer with an underrated guitar. In hindsight, Hagar brought a 2nd quality guitar to VH (he's nowhere close to the ballpark Eddie plays in, but who is?). With all this being said, I like this \\"5150\\". At first, I wanted to ban anything Hagar did with VH because only the DLR era stuff was real VH. This album has absolutely grown on me over the years though. Three big hits came from \\"5150\\" - \\"Dreams\\" (reaching #6 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart), \\"Love Walks In\\" (#4), and \\"Why Can't This Be Love\\" (#1). Minor hits followed with \\"Best Of Both Worlds\\" and \\"Summer Nights\\". The feel was more slick, polished, commercial rock... heavily ladened with keyboards. Along with a new lead singer, the other big difference was Alex's electronic drum kit (these were big in the 80's... and a lot of bands used them including Def Leppard, Ratt, Genesis, etc). Having played drums in the past, I feel these electronic drums really give off a different sound. For me, 10 times out of 10, I'd choose a real drum kit. Perhaps I've given the impression that I'm not a fan of the Hagar era VH... not true - this is a good rock album. It simply lacks that \\"in your face\\" attitude, and most importantly character. Highlights include all the songs mentioned above as well as the rocking opener \\"Good Enough\\" and the underrated title track (\\"5150\\" meaning mentally/emotionally disturbed). The album closer should have been a hidden bonus track - perhaps untitled - \\"Inside\\" is filler at best. Looking at the 4 studio albums Hagar did with VH, I'd pick this one first. The albums that came after \\"5150\\" seemed even more safe by rock music standards. Worthy in your rock and roll library - absolutely. However, if I want to hear some Van Halen, I'll grab VH's debut, \\"VH II\\", \\"Fair Warning\\", \\"Women & Children First\\" or \\"1984\\" first. If I'm in the mood for Sammy Hagar, I'll most likely grab his \\"Standing Hampton\\" or \\"VOA\\" before this one. I think \\"5150\\" would benefit from digital remastering (as of 2007 it hasn't happened). The start of a new era for the Van Halen brothers and Sammy - \\"5150\\" wasn't Van Halen's first album to reach Billboard's #1 position for no reason.

B000GPIPT2|5.0|This version of Frankenstein with Boris Karloff is an absolute classic.  It is among the finest films produced within the horror genre.  It is interesting to note that this film was released during the years of the Great Depression when so many Americans were out of work and starving on the streets.  Despite those terrible times when most people obviously could not afford to pay for movie tickets, this movie was well attended by crowds standing in long lines wanting to get into the theaters to watch a spectacle which, for many, was truly frightening.<br /><br />Boris Karloff, the actor who portrayed the monster of Frankenstein, was also an interesting individual in his own right.  He was a former truck driver who struggled through the 1920s decade by performing in minor roles in various silent movies.  It was through pure luck when Karloff was picked for the role of the monster, and truly a fortuitous one.  He was seen in a cafeteria by Director James Whale who thought Karloff's face would be ideal for being made up as the monster.  Karloff accepted this role as being another pay day for him.  It was not until the release of the film when Boris Karloff realized that this role was the tipping point for him to go from being a journeyman actor to a movie star.  He has for many years until he died in 1969 expressed his appreciation for taking on this role and what it did for his career. Karloff's success in this film was not only in the make up he wore, but also in being able to provide a truly poignant performance which has thoroughly connected with not only the audience's fears but also their sympathies toward those who are rejected outsiders.  Boris Karloff's excellent acting skills were further borne out in many other films which were made in subsequent years.  He was truly deserving of the recognition of being called one of the horror genre's finest...and a true gentleman.<br /><br />It should be noted that this film did not strictly follow the story line provided by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus.  It did use some elements of the classic novel by having a scientist mingle with the concept of creating a living human being from lifeless materials in a laboratory setting.  In the novel, the materials used and the process of creation were not clearly stated because of the use of allegorical language by author Shelley.  However, in the movie, the monster was shown as being put together using body parts from hanged bodies which were stolen from the gallows (and a demented criminal brain which was stolen from a medical laboratory).  The novel further has the laboratory being somewhat shabby and ordinary looking in appearance, whereas, in the movie, it is huge and distinctive with a clear Germanic gothic style.  Also, the monster in the novel was quite an articulate fellow, while, in the movie, he or it remained mute.  Despite these differences, Frankenstein the movie was a joy to watch and to remember.  The monster's appearance which was created by makeup genius Jack Pierce was truly incredible and one which has been burned into the collective memory of many thousands of movie goers.  To this day, Karloff as Frankenstein's creation remains the iconic image of the monster for all times.  The other performers in the film also did splendid work.  Colin Clive was ideal as Dr. Henry Frankenstein, the crazed creator of the monster.  Dwight Frye was excellent as the clearly lunatic and hunchbacked Fritz (many viewers mistakenly thought the name of this character was Igor).  We also have other players doing great work in supporting roles, such as Edward Van Sloan as Dr. Waldman and Mae Clark as Dr. Frankenstein's fianc&eacute;e Elizabeth.<br /><br />Finally, we must recognize that this film was ultimately the great work of a great movie director, James Whale.  He has created a style and ensured that the movie would be moving along at a quick pace.  What truly amazes me is that this film involves only one hour and eleven minutes of viewing time.  However, one leaves with the feeling that the story told was very complete and compelling.  It would be very easy for a movie director to take the same story and stretch it into two hours or more without showing any lagging in action and drama.  Director Whale was clearly the key to making all the elements in this film click together and create a movie which to this day remains recognizable for viewers of all ages!  This is truly an awesome classic which well deserves to be listed among the 20th century's 100 finest films by the American Film Institute.<br /><br />I have viewed the DVD presentation of Frankenstein and am amazed at how well Universal has been able to take such an old film and make it appear as it was the day it first came out and was seen by the public.  I personally enjoyed the new 75th Anniversary edition because of film and the Bonus features which include:  A Tribute to the film career of Boris Karloff, Monster Tracks which are interactive pop-ups providing interesting facts about different parts of the film, feature commentaries by two prominent scholars, The Frankenstein Files which informs on how the movie was made, Frankenstein Archives with plenty of pictures and posters connected to the movie, a short film called Boo!, and finally a great documentary which highlights the classic horror genre movies made by Universal Studio.  Those bonus features should satisfy the interest of most folks who want to learn more about the Frankenstein film.

B000MR1V22|4.0|Like all girls in the preteen age group - they fancy themselves princesses.  This movie is no exception to that rule.  It is a bit \\"off\\" as the ex-hippie, druggie grandfather who teaches the adorable and talented young-lady star her dance routine flails a plethora of X rated words and announcements at everyone within earshot continuously until he dies from a drug overdose.  With a multitude of unrealistic problems occuring, the family finally is able to deliver their daughter, with grapa's body stuffed in the back of their VW van, to the talent show amidst the stuck-up's and snobs.

B000O75F7C|5.0|Porcupine Tree have crafted two incredibly beautiful masterpieces: In Absentia and Deadwing. While those two albums are perfect in their own way, Fear of a Blank Planet blows both of them out of the water.    First of all, this album is HEAVY HEAVY HEAVY. It does have it's lighter songs like \\"My Ashes\\" and \\"Sentimental\\", but overall, this is definitely Porcupine Tree's heaviest album to date.  The title track, \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" begins with a few light guitar strums, and then Steven Wilson's voice comes in and it booms into a field of crunchy guitars and madness. There is a bit of vocal experimentation in the title track (probably through a vocoder or something similar). \\"Anesthetize\\" is the heaviest and longest song on the album, and also the best; and the 20 second boom of chaos of guitars and drums rapidly playing around eleven minutes into the song will be sure to please all metalheads. It might even be Porcupine Tree's best song to date, surpassing \\"Arriving Somewhere but Not Here\\" on Deadwing. \\"Way Out of Here\\" is about as heavy as \\"Anesthetize\\", though less than half as long; it is one of the better tracks on the album. \\"Sleep Together\\", the album's final track, ends the album with a subtle amount of heaviness and a ton of psychedelia that will please fans of Porcupine Tree's much older and forgotten material such as Up the Downstair and Signify.    Overall, Fear of a Blank Planet is another masterpiece for Steven Wilson and his amazing crew. It's also one of 2007's finest releases already. If you're a fan of Porcupine Tree, this is an essential buy. If you only like their older material and cannot except the fact that Porcupine Tree have changed (for the better, in my opinion), then avoid this album. If you're a fan of progressive metal or progressive rock, you can't really go wrong. Rating this album anything less than five stars would be slander.      Tracklisting: (My album picks are denoted with an asterisk)    01- Fear of a Blank Planet (7:28) *02- My Ashes (5:07)  03- Anesthetize (17:42) *  04- Sentimental (5:26)  05- Way Out of Here (7:38) *  06- Sleep Together (7:19)
B000NDIAWO|4.0|The orginial studio album, while it took awhile getting used to, was a great improvement over her first solo album; although Dangerously In Love is an R&B classic in today's market. She took music to another level that her contemporaries (i.e. Ashanti, Rihanna) can't even reach and I give her that. It took me about a good three months to get into B'day and I'm sure it took everybody else that same amount of time given the little we were given to work with.  <br />The re-release is a great re-release when you compare it to past re-releases from other artists (Usher) but she wasted a second disc in my opinion. While the new songs on the 1st disc add more substance and ground to the album, the second disc could've been more if she added all the songs she recorded in between albums, to include songs she did for \\"DreamGirls\\", \\"Pink Panther\\" and \\"Rich Man's Wife\\" and the other songs that weren't included on the orginial like \\"Creole\\" \\"Lost Yo' Mind\\" \\"Sexuality\\" \\"Sexuality [Remix]\\" \\"My First Time\\" \\"Woman Like Me\\" \\"Back Up\\" \\"One Night Only [Extended Version]\\", the songs she performed at the Academy Awards about a year ago, in my opinion and some of the spanish songs that are on the second disc as well. I wouldn't have wasted a whole 2nd CD on a few spanish songs and release them in the U.S. I would've taken the opportunity to release all the songs that were recorded in her two-week span and then some. There wasn't a Video Anthology with my CD and I was mad, I saw the Upgrade special and the videos were nice but I was upset that she didn't do a video for \\"Kitty Kat\\" and was it me or was the \\"Get Me Bodied\\" video really long?. How cute was it that she, Solange and Destiny's Child were in the video dancing and being cute? That was real nice.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|This is a great sweeper.  It should be remembered that this is an electric sweeper and not a vacuum, so if you are looking for a vacuum, this may not be for you.  But if you are looking for a sweeper, this one top notch.  It really gets under and around everything.  So far, the battery has given me several uses before requiring recharing, but I don't like that it can overcharged and gives no indication of when to stop charging it.  I set a timer and keep my fingers crossed that I am not overcharging it and thus ruining it.  I wish they had charged a little more for the unit and upgraded the battery, but I would still buy another of these even with this limitation.  Living in a northern climate where so much gravel and dirt are tracked in during the winter and spring, I find that we are picking up the floor-damaging dirt much more often.  This is because the SS is so convenient that we get it out quite often.  And as an added bonus, my almost 9-year old son loves using it, so I have been able to nag a bit less about his chores that involve sweeping.  I thought about buying this for years, but have been burned by these TV vacuums before and was hesitant.  I'm glad I took a chance on this one.
1559408855|5.0|This film, Salo, is based upon the novel \\"The 120 Days of Sodom\\" by the Marquis de Sade.  This film is not an exploitation film, contrary to popular belief.  This film is actually a work of art: a most PAINFUL work of art!  It is about power wielded in the most abusive fashion.  It is a story about four fascist libertines who kidnap sixteen children of both genders to indulge freely in every human depravity over a period of four months.  Any act of humanity is punished in the most inhumane fashion imaginable, and obedience is the only social law behind the walls of the great mansion they hibernate in with their degraded human victims. <br /> <br />This film is important for two reasons; reason one, it reminds us of the depths of human cruelty we are all capable of.  And two, it is a searing portrait of the fact that the garden of human delights is not always lighted with the virtues of human kindness and goodness; but rather illuminated by the depravities of the human expression of violence and rape as the means of absolute power and control over other fellow human beings, a most alarming fact of nature!! <br /> <br />The holocaust is not two steps behind us in human history, to forget our own evil is to allow it to persist.  This film will hopefully remind us of the very real evil that lurks in the human subconsious, and given enough power and money, any of it can be acted out without threat of reproach or punishment.  Watch this film, even if for no other reason than to Awake from the hopeless dream that keeps the common man blind from the tyrant's unbound twisted pleasure in the destruction of fellow human beings.
0316010669|3.0|i thought this book would provide with some insight to my own inner voice but it is a collection of different stories some of which can actually confuse you when you try to relate to the main point of the book.  are we suppose to follow our first insight or not?  it does not really teach you anything but offers series of interesting stories...
0201485672|5.0|This is one of the best books that sit in my office desk. I really enjoyed reading this book & implementing lot of the refactorings.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|So reads the apocalyptic billboard graffiti which appears in one of the opening scenes of Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's \\"Children of Men,\\" and that's just the kind of bleak but brilliant (and morbidly humorous) touch that epitomizes this film and its landscape.<br /><br />The year is 2027, and the world is having a tough day.  Nay, make that a tough century.  Ever since the flu pandemic of 2008 (get your inoculations, people!), there have been no baby births for 18 years.  We know this because the film opens with a shot of downtrodden Brits gathering around a TV set in a coffee shop, crying over the death of \\"Baby Diego\\" (the heretofore world's youngest person), with non-stop coverage that's probably provided by the British version of Inside Edition (assuming they've moved on from Anna Nicole Smith news by then).<br /><br />From one of many TV's suspended from the ceiling of a commuter train on Theo Faron's (Clive Owen) trip home from work (where everyone was slacking, watching streaming video coverage of Baby Diego - good to see that at least some things don't change in the future!), we learn something else: \\"The World Has Collapsed - Only Britain Soldiers On,\\" says the announcer.<br /><br />Yeah sure thing, Mr. Announcer: tell that to the mob of debris-hurling miscreants attacking the train.  Or Theo himself, who just a little earlier narrowly avoided getting blown to bits when the aforementioned coffee shop exploded.  Suffice it to say, Britain is not soldiering on quite as well as the onboard propaganda would have you believe - or maybe it's all relative, since we also see a lovely montage of the rest of the world engulfed in various explosions and insurgencies.  On the other hand, we also find things so topsy-turvy in futuristic Britannia, that people actually drive on the left side of the street - preposterous, I say!<br /><br />Regardless, Theo's having a tough day too, and it's about to get tougher when an old flame (Julianne Moore) recruits him to assist with the riskiest midwifery the future has ever seen.  He then gets caught up in navigating his way through clashes between the government and an Uprising that may or may not turn out to be more dangerous to a baby than dingoes in the outback  And all the poor bloke really wants is a drink.  Gadzooks.<br /><br />\\"Children of Men\\" is exceptional with what it does well, and disappointing for what it does not.  What it does well: cinematography, editing and production design.  The sets are brilliantly and meticulously detailed, even if they lack some of the special effects and gadgetry that some might feel the future should be infused with.  As others have also remarked upon, the long uninterrupted takes are unprecedented in an action movie of this scope and scale, and the camerawork and choreography are exquisite.<br /><br />Another nifty touch I particularly appreciated was the seemingly incongruous injections of wildlife in the urban decay: the deer in the school, the sheep in the street and the chickens in the stairwell - all perhaps reminding us that life will go on with or without us, and psychologically ratcheting up the stakes on a subconscious level.<br /><br />The films also does a good job of including controversial aspects of today's political landscape, which act as visual and aural markers that connect the viewer from the world of today to the world that's depicted onscreen.  We will all no doubt recognize the use of dogs and hoods in the detention center, the phrase \\"homeland security\\" and the flyers for the missing.  (Plus, as Theo's hippie friend Jasper (Michael Caine) points out, suicide kits and antidepressants are provided in governmentally-distributed ration packs, but pot is STILL illegal...)  Whether one agrees or not with the editorial choices behind these images, I feel their use creates an urgency that the film would lack were there not such intensely recognizable elements from today's political climate appearing amidst the action.<br /><br />Where the film disappoints me: plot, writing and - surprisingly enough - acting.  First, the plot.  However well filmed, this movie is really just one big chase scene.  And brilliant premise notwithstanding (a premise whose explanation I personally don't feel is necessary), there's little in the way of what one could legitimately label \\"intrigue\\".<br /><br />Also, the writing is a bit heavy-handed at times.  In one scene, the annoying Miriam (Pam Ferris) becomes the Queen of Exposition: \\"As the sound of the playgrounds faded, the despair set in.\\"  Ugh.  Might as well have used an omniscient narrative voiceover for that clunker of a line (and here's where I might infer something from the fact that this movie has five credited screenwriters, if I were a cynical fellow - which I obviously am not, ha ha).<br /><br />Lastly, the acting - while serviceable - could have been so much more, given the talent level of the cast.  I'm guessing that the nuts and bolts technical aspects of shooting such difficult scenes must have played havoc with at least some of the actors' performances.<br /><br />Overall, this film has a pretty big \\"wow\\" factor - especially for fans of cinematography and set design and all that kind of filmmaking wankery (which I do love).  But a more intricate plot, and better writing/acting could have pushed it into the realm of a classic.  As it is, I'm hovering between three and four stars for the film, but the DVD features are just enough that I'll lean towards the four (even though I'm disappointed at the lack of any commentary tracks).br />Where the film disappoints me: plot, writing and - surprisingly enough - acting.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|This a good movie for anyone who loves Will Smith and in my opinion this is the best movie I've seen him in.It's very emotional but has a great ending and it's full of love between a Father and his son.
0740748475|3.0|There were good days and then bad days.....Snowman the best....Other  <br /> <br />days...You just go \\"Huh?\\"
B000A6T262|5.0|A very good set!!! The quality and sound are excellent. Great set - Go Trekies!!
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Having attended the Confessions Tour in San Jose,  we had a chance to see  Madonna upclose...we were right next to the catwalk for the entire concert.   So we  had an excellent view of  the dancers, as well.  The DVD was brilliant!   Almost as good as being there!   And for two folks who had closeup seats, that says something.   Buy it, you will be thrilled!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I was introduced to Evanescence shortly after their first album was released. I fell for the sound immediately and of course, wanted more of it to be released! But there was quite a lull between the first and second albums and I began to worry that when (or if) the second album came out, it would sound just like the first or so different than the first that I wouldn't be able to recognize it.<br /><br />NOT SO! The Open Door brings a fresh approach the same underlying essence of the original album. The vocals are breath-taking at times, the hooks are catchy but not annoyingly so, the background of most songs is complex and artfully-composed. I have enjoyed this album as much, if not more, than their first release. Way to go, Evanescence, you've not fallen prey to the 2nd release lameness that so many others fail to escape!
B00005MP58|4.0|Very enjoyable. It is much more faithful to the book, being longer, it may. I recommended this to Austen devotees. <br /> <br />I would like to take some characters from this version and some from the new Keira Knightley version to see the most faithful version of all.
B000KX0IOK|1.0|this movie is terribel, it's boring, slow and just down right horroabile. The acting was good just the movie sucked. do not waste your time.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I enjoy listening to this Soundtrack whenever I can.  The music is so beautiful.
B00005JPMX|5.0|I've all ways been a fan of the turtles i'm glad that they finally made an animated movie of the turtles. they are making a big comeback. I sure do hope that there is a sequel. just can't get enough of those crazy mutant turtles.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|I honestly can't find anything on this album to dislike. I thought that \\"Through The Ashes\\" was a killer album, their best even.<br /><br />But, this album is like the unloved brother to \\"Ashes\\" ! It's been hiding in the darkest corners of Rob Flynn's mind, and it finally had enough and wanted to strike.<br /><br />I seriously enjoy every track on here. One of the other reviewers said that \\"Now I Lay Thee Down\\" was probably the least favorite, well, I am the opposite.<br /><br />This album opens with some slow, moody acoustic guitars, and after about 1 minute, it doesn't stop punching you in the face.<br /><br />Amazing guitar work, dueling solos, drumming like a stampede of the horsemen of the apocolypse, some of the most heart-felt, angry, aggresive vocals, and some beautiful singing top this album quite nicely.<br /><br /> Start to finish, this is one strong album. I think Machine Head have definitely raised the bar for not only the bands releasing albums around them, but, also for themselves.<br /><br />It'll be tough to outdo this record.<br /><br />One Complaint: I just saw Machine Head play here in Florida, and they only got to play 5 songs !!!<br /><br />Only 2 of which were from this album.<br /><br />They played 1)Clenching the Fists... 2)Imperium 3)Aesthetics of Hate  4) Oldman  5)Davidian.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is the most beautiful documentary ever made about Planet Earth !!! <br />To answer your question Noah, Yes it is exactly the same documentary...It has been made by the BBC and Discovery Channel bought the complete series to broadcast them in the United States as well as many other channels in the World! But I don't know why they changed the narrator !!! Anyway on the DVD/HDDVD/BluRay it's gonna be the original UK version so it's gonna be David Attenborough the narrator. <br /> <br />The shots are wonderful especially in the FreshWater Chapter when they filmed the Igacu Falls ! It's Stunning !!! Gran Canyon as well... <br /> <br />Anyway it's the movie to own to fully enjoy your HD Screen and your HDDVD Player !!! <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Curse the idiots at FOX for canceling this show. This show rocks, pure and simple. Great characters, great stories, lots of fun. This is the best show I've seen on ages, and it's canceled. Can't wait to watch the movie!  <br />
0060853980|1.0|I love fantasy novels and some of Neil Gaman's other works (such as American Gods) but this book is quite different.  I found it's style and humor difficult to read and appreciate, and put it down after about a hundred pages.
B000NA28I4|4.0|I loed the movie... great cinematography. I have a feeling this movie will be a continuing saga... the ending says it all! Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!
B000M4RG42|5.0|Love the movie... Great action and story! Buy it if you don't have it! You'll love it too!

B00005N6KG|5.0|I have been searching for comfortable in-the-ear headphones for months and I finally found these. In the past headphones have hurt my ears or slipped out when running, but these stay in and are very comfortable. The only problem was that when I ran on the treadmill and had them plugged into the headphone slot so I could hear the TV, I kept getting shocked in my ears and had to take them off. They were fine in my mp3 player, though. I think I just generate a lot of static electricity when running.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I will leave the track by track analysis to others.  I just simply want to say that this serves as a stunning reminder of what Rock was all about. The energy and passion pouring out of these performance will leave you dumbfounded.  And remind you that no over dubbed studio recording can ever match this peerless band in full flight.
B000I2JKE2|5.0|I been a fan of superman since I was a little boy.I was so happy when superman returns came out.But when I went to see the movie, I was not happy with it.Anyway superman 2 Richard Donner cut is what superman 2 is all about this is far one of the best titles out of the hole series.The hd dvd looks very good,sharp picture,outstanding sound.
B000MTDRKE|5.0|Another excellent offering from Neal Morse! This differs only in that it is <br />more guitar oriented than his previously released keyboard oriented albums. <br />And, as always, Neal pens some thought provoking lyrics which emphasize his <br />growing Christian faith. A must have for Christian Progressive Rock fans.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|If you have heard any of their other music you will love this.  It is fabulous.
B000GW8RX4|4.0|I loved Dio and the band but Blackmore is a hog as always.
0375507256|5.0|I picked up this novel because someone told me: \\"It's like a new genre.\\" <br /> <br />I wouldn't say that--necessarily--but it is one of the most beautiful books that I've read in my entire life. <br /> <br />Cloud Atlas is written in a pyramid structure. I, being the impatient reader that I am, struggled initially with the climb up the six stories. I have to say though, you don't climb back down the story pyramid--you slide down. I think that I read the last six stories of Cloud Atlas faster than I have read any other 300 pages in my life--I was so enthralled. <br /> <br />This book is, at its heart, a critique of society's influence over man. You won't necessarily understand how or why until the middle story--but then the subtle profundity of it all hits you over the head like a cast-iron pan. <br /> <br />I was in love with each and every single one of the characters by the end of the novel--this book captures all genres: romance, sci-fi, mystery, classical prose. Some have said that the first chapter is difficult to read, although I think a great number of women might have an easier time with it, especially if they are aficionados of Jane Austen and other like 18th century writings, they might just breeze through it.
B00062RCBW|5.0|...that I bought this set.  :)  I finally had to come clean and tell her that I had actually gone to ST convention when I was in university.  But what a great show this was!  It's hard to believe it actually began in the late-80s... <br /> <br />I'm having a great time re-watching this show after all these years.  We used to watch it in college every week and STNG has aged very gracefully.  I've only gotten through the first two seasons, and was a little surprised by the...umm...not so fantastic quality of the video.  I'm hoping this will improve through the seasons when the network began to spend more money on the show.   <br /> <br />Looking forward to buying the ST movies now, and maybe the Voyager series.  Buy this set!  Relive the memories!
074356619X|1.0|Well now, if there were no negative there could be no Positive, for all things must be balanced to exist in a harmonious way. This Idea is not a completely bad one, it's just not whole, and that means it is only half the picture. Common sense in matters; MATTERS! One must balance the Ying and Yang to create the whole being. How would one know what the Positive was if there where no Negative to compare to? Yes Believe, educate, Focus, practice, Work Hard, Achieve. But by no means disillusion yourself into thinking the positive can live without the negative. For if anything is unbalanced; IT WILL FALL OVER!
B00005JNS0|4.0|My nephews loved this video and were thrilled when they got it as a gift.
B0007OY2P8|5.0|This production of Austen's best satire gets the author's meaning across and is entertaining, beautiful and well-acted. The 20th century music offends some purists (which I usually am) but I liked it and thought it didn't detract from the wonderful acting or Austen's extraordinary story. My favorite part is the final scene when Henry Tillney comes to propose to Catherine. It is easy to see in the young woman's eyes that she is wondering if he is real or just another of her novel-inspired fantasies. Wonderful!!!
1582701709|5.0|This book has really helped me to begin positive thinking in my life.  I got alot out of it and will use it to refer back too when I am feeling overwhelmed.  I have found that when I am stressing out in any situation I can start positive thinking and it really has helped.
B000O178BY|5.0|I am a huge fan of almost everything that Reznor has done. From 'Pretty Hate Machine' through 'With Teeth', it seems to always be that kind of music that speaks to you and that you can find an easy connection to. This newest release is by far one of his greatest accomplishments. From beginning to end 'Year Zero' grabs you and does not let go until it finally falls to silence. Through all the noise and Reznor's trademark voice is a concept of a not-too-distant future vision of the world. This is a world that has been destroyed by war, mind control, over-powered politicians and the like. The album takes this concept and tells the \\"story\\" from several viewpoints. Some songs are told in more of an objective form such as \\"The Beginning of the End\\" and \\"God Given\\". Some, however, are told from a very personal point of view that can be seen as very obvious comparisons to the world we live in today (albeit taken to a slightly higher extreme). The album never trully breaks form and is able to provide several layers of meaning to the listener, making it much much more than just a concept album. There are no throw-away tracks either. Almost every track is single worthy.  <br /> <br />Do not expect what you've heard in the past. No two albums of Reznor's are quite the same. This is no exception. Those who were disappointed by 'With Teeth' will be pleasantly surprised at this newest outing. Even if you have never heard Nine Inch Nails before, this is as good a starting point as any. There is something for everyone here and it is truly one of the \\"must-buys\\" of the 21st century in western culture music.   <br /> <br />
B000MXPE7O|3.0|I watched this last night. I am a fan of Francis Ford Copolla, but was NOT IMPRESSED with this film. Did Matt even smile? Of course, all of this was way before my time, so that may have something to do with it. The acting wasn't bad. I think the film just had a major sleepy feel to it. I rented it because I am a fan of all the stars in the movie. I guess, I expected more.
0151012768|2.0|This is a combination of:  <br />- a biter-sweet tale of failing marriage & a tentative romance,  <br />- a jocular political satire, and <br />- an evocation of the spiritual wonders of salmon-fishing and the Yemeni landscape.  <br />It is as if Anita Brookner, Tom Sharpe and Tracy Kidder wrote random chapters of the same story. All this is presented in the form of implausible diary-entries, emails and letters, with half-a-dozen different voices, each telling parts of the same story without adding anything from their own perspective. The mixture of voices, styles, and tones was annoying, the story was thin and the characters were crudely drawn; each point was made in a leaden and obvious way. I wanted to tell the author to go away and rewrite this into one good long book, instead of trying (and failing) to cleverly merge three 'brilliant' short stories. <br />
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|I was transferred to the Emerald Isle as I listened to this CD.
096798467X|5.0|Kiko has done it again, I own the two previous editions and this new edition is a clear improvement.  <br />The addition of an insulation layer in the oven construction enhances the oven performance and brings professional bake oven results. Still simple enough to build yourself though.  <br />There is also more information on bread making as well as more color and more of the illustrative and entertaining illustrations.  <br />Highly recommended!
B000MG1YC0|2.0|Well if you're an old time fan of Morten Veland, you will hate this album. It's extremely accessible, eschewing pretty much everything Morten and Sirenia have stood for over the length of their collective existence.     A couple of these songs are enjoyable if you close your eyes and pretend what you're hearing isn't supposed to be Sirenia; and if you've never heard of Sirenia before you heard \\"My Minds' Eye\\" on the radio then I suppose you will love this album. But to me, a fan of Sirenia and a fan of Tristania before that, this is the worst kind of sellout gone wrong.     I suppose since this is a review and it's supposed to be objective, I had better give a better description of the music itself. The songs (that's all they are.. songs) are 3-4 minutes, have predictable verse-chorus patterns and the obligatory choir sounds hurried and out of place in this new, radio-friendly Sirenia.  The solitary female singer is seldom accompanied by Veland, and never effectively, but she has a decent enough voice that serves the purpose. Don't expect a rare talent, though. None of the pieces are particularly memorable, though a few are catchy. It will probably take you only a few listens before the novelty wears off and after that, the CD offers very little in terms of longevity; it's not one of those that will stick with you.     Bottom line is, if you're a fan of Sirenia, this new album is a disgrace. If you're not a fan of Sirenia but like some of the songs, save yourself some money and just download those songs in particular because they all start to sound the same and none of them are really memorable.  A very generous two stars is the verdict.
B000MTDRKE|4.0|This is an incredible album.  As a Christian who loves and plays music, I appreciate the musicianship of this album and the way that Neal Morse has incorporated his faith into the message. <br /> <br />This album is a bit heavier musically than his previous albums - but if you like Transatlantic, Spock's Beard, or other Prog Rock music, you should have this CD in your collection.
0618680004|5.0|This book is very insightful and I am not an athiest but I do like to see things from other's point of view...never know when you might learn something new, or a better way of seeing something.  I bought the book after seeing Richard Dawkins'lecture about it on Book TV on Cspan last summer. I found his lecture pretty intriguing and wanted to read more about what his take on the subject was...(I found him to be quite bright, actually brilliantly intelligent).....I recommend the book definitely if you share his views, and if you don't, I still recommend it if you are open to at least considering there could always be other answers.  It doesn't hurt to have an open mind, so you can expand your knowledge and know it gives you the power to make more informed decisions. Hope you enjoy!!!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I've been to many different types of musicals and this is by far one of the best newer ones out there.  You can sing along with the songs, and feel both uplifted and saddened at the lyrics.  Very good twists to the meanings in the songs.  Funny and captivating in its circular storyline.
B000M341QE|4.0|This was a very entertaining movie, it had a surprising ending that you will either love or hate. I liked it, my wife hated it. But overall, it is one of the better police action movies I have seen recently. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that there were too many Hollywood actors trying on that Boston accent thing which triped me up a little, maybe if it had been filmed in New York or LA it would have been a little more genuine and believable.
B0009UC810|5.0|this is such an incredible movie!!! such good music!!! <br /> <br />incredible cast and great humor!! <br /> <br />BUY THIS MOVIE
B000J4QWMC|2.0|This movie contained alot of nice visual effects and the sound effects were pretty impressive. However, for some reason Gong Li who is Chinese played the role a Cuban woman who was the lead actress in the movie.  It says alot about the Hollywood studios that they can't cast qualified Hispanics for leading roles even in movies that take place in or are about Latin America. This was a major setback to the film, it lacked believability, it was not genuine to me at all.
B000GIXEIG|2.0|Hwaet? A forgetable Beowulf and Grendel? This effort is a different story entirely set inside a kind of hollowed out facsimile of the original Beowulf. In this version Grendel isn't much of a monster, but rather a poor, misunderstood, confused adolescent-type seeking revenge on the Danes who selfishly killed his father many years before. It seems to go downhill from there. Lots of missed opportunity for real story-telling/movie-making.    HOWEVER, what I did find interesting and even intriguing are some of the special features like the replay with commentary and a segment from a documentary \\"Wrath of Gods\\" about the making of \\"Beowulf and Grendel.\\" The movie was shot in Iceland which has some breath taking scenery that is actually quite dangerous to shoot in. There is one moment on a beach where the waves are over forty feet high and the tide is coming in dangerously fast. In fact one big wave almost washes away a $100,000 camera lens, an SUV and 2 workers! Another scene on a four hundred foot shear cliff is intense and exciting as they describe the dangers in shooting it. At times this part of the DVD is actually a kind of dramatic and informative story itself: vulnerable people accomplishing something challenging by overcoming obstacles in sometimes near impossible conditions.    Just wish it were something worthwhile they accomplished. Beowulf is a great story and deserves an epic presentation in its own right. This is not it.
B00004RYCP|5.0|This was a great movie. Flowed perfectly from one scene to the next. It had a strong humorous element as well! I believe this is the best one in the entire series. Jack Nicholson stole the show, he was phenomenal as the Joker!
B00005JP1A|2.0|It's very surprising that \\"The Reaping\\" doesn't work; religious messages have been notoriously well acquainted with the horror genre, and most of the time, it works quite well (\\"The Exorcist,\\" \\"The Omen,\\" \\"Frailty,\\" the original \\"Wicker Man,\\" etc.). Maybe that's because they relied on both shock value and story for advancement. \\"The Reaping\\" certainly succeeds in being shocking, with plenty of pop out scares and a few well placed disturbing images. But in terms of story, something was seriously lacking. The events of this film make absolutely no sense, with one crucial plot device clashing against every other, turning it into a convoluted mess. This isn't a case of leaving with more questions than answers; you leave with no answers at all. <br /> <br />The plot centers on Katherine Winter (Hilary Swank), a Louisiana State University professor. When not in class, she travels the world, using her scientific skills to debunk claims of miraculous events. She was once a devout Christian, but she lost her faith when her husband and daughter were murdered on an African missionary excursion. This clearly adds conflict to the story, as shown when a man named Doug (David Morrissey) seeks her assistance. Strange things have been happening in his hometown of Haven, namely the first plague of the Old Testament (a river turning into blood). Upon entering Haven and examining the river, Winter learns of Loren McConnell (AnnaSophia Robb), a young girl believed to be responsible for her brother's death. She's also believed to be a servant of Satan, which may account for the condition of the river. <br /> <br />Winter is initially unwilling to accept anything the town believes; she's confident that she can find a scientific explanation for the river turning red. But then another biblical plague occurs. Then another. And another. And another. After a while it becomes obvious that something powerful is at work here, something that cannot be explained through science. This understandablyleaves Winter unsure of anything anymore. Are the plagues actually religious phenomena, and is a young girl responsible for it all? <br /> <br />That's about as much of the plot as I can describe; the last half of the film is wall-to-wall revelations, none of which I can give away. What I can say is that the revelations are confusing and nonsensical. There's a complicated subplot involving a satanic cult and birth order, with the first borns safe from harm and the second borns in danger, or something like that. There's also a brief performance by Stephen Rea as Father Costigan, a priest who was with Winter when her family was murdered. He knows that she's in danger because of an ancient prophecy that predates Christianity. What no one seems to know is why she needed to be involved at all; were it not for the fact that she's the main character, one would have a hard time explaining why the simple folk of Haven, Louisiana would need her. I can't elaborate on this, but I will say that the final plot twists are of no help. <br /> <br />Apparently, this film was delayed, with an original release date of August 2006. I can't help but feel that such a long delay contributed to the mess it's currently in; it seemed as if important details were edited out in order to appease the studio execs, the MPAA, the test audiences, or any combination thereof. I can definitely say that the film's structure is bad, but I'm not sure I can say the same thing about the film in general. I obviously don't know this for sure, but I have a feeling that a well-edited director's cut would fix everything, or at least enough of it to make the events of the story much more understandable. When and if such a version of \\"The Reaping\\" comes to fruition, I'll recommend it. Until then, keep as far away from this film as possible; it's a disaster of biblical proportions.
B00005JKC3|1.0|Before I saw this movie I thought I would enjoy it. I enjoyed watching the miniseries when I was a kid. However, nothing could prepare me for what I was about to watch on screen. It was an absolute disaster of a film. I do enjoy superhero movies, some recent ones I like are the Spiderman series and Batman. But the Hulk did not inspire me at all, it was like going to the Dentist to get a tooth pulled. The character is a cartoon-like green figure, totally lacking in his emotional capacities, not even his rage convinced me, it looked like a video game more than a movie. This film had no serious plot worthy of mention. It was just plain painful to watch. If I could give it half a star I would!
0679809015|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because if you manage your expectations, it more than delivers.  At 4\\"x4\\", it is small, compact, light and portable--great for a NYC mom like me who carried it with me everywhere we went during the 9 month-2 year period of my son's babyhood.  It was great at simultaneously demonstrating the lift-the-flap book concept and introducing farm animals and their sounds to babies.  As my son grew older, (as kids do with their toys and books), his relationship and engagement with the book evolved as well and I found him thoroughly enjoying not only the flap-lifting, but also combining reading of the book with intermittent breaks of \\"Old McDonald\\" stanzas.  For a small book, it has a lot of punch.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I think this is the best superhero action movie since the first Batman back in 1989. I loved the visuals and the character development was superbly done. Overall great story, great movie, and it was even inspirational!
B0000025T6|5.0|This album is the most stark and musically spare album in the Springsteen repetoire. There are songs about unrepentant murderers (Nebraska, Johnny 99), biased cops (Highway Patrolman), gambling in New Jersey (Atlantic City), hard economic times (Used Cars), and a suicidal driver (State Trooper). The album ends with the cynical \\"Reason to Believe,\\" a song about people in denial who find a reason to hope when all hope is gone. <br /> <br />The album is a powerful statement of pessimism during the Reagan era, made all the more clear by its spare instrumentation, haunting lyrics, and the vocals of Springsteen high above everything else. A few of the songs rock, even with their acoustic guitar and harmonica arrangements. A rewarding and rigorous record.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|The name's Bond...James Bond.  <br /> <br />Oh, I can't get enough of that line. Thats right though, Bond is back. Casino Royale is unlike any Bond movie you've ever seen, and you can take that to the bank. Casino Royale's basic premise is on how (finally a \\"good\\" bad guy) bad guy Le Chiffre (played by Mads Mikkelsen) loses a bunch of money that wasn't his in the first place. He didn't just lose it via the stockmarket though, he lost it because James decides to crash his \\"explosive\\" party. This ends up leading to the main setting at the high-stakes poker table inside Casino Royale. Trust me, the scenes with Le Chiffre and Bond playing poker are quite intense. I'm getting ahead of myself however. Let's take a step back. <br /> <br />Casino Royale is based on the Ian Flemming novel with the same title. It's actually the very first installment in the Bond series so when you watch this put aside your linear thinking because you have to watch this and pretend it's the first Bond ever. Sean Connery who? Bond is promoted to 007 status at the beginning of the film after he tags two kills. Its obvious from the get-go that Bond is not the pretty-boy gadget-heavy MI6 you're used to. There is even more hand-to-hand combat in the first 15 minutes of the movie than there is in all the Brosnan Bond features combined....oh and did I mention he doesn't use silly gadgets? Not to say there aren't gadgets, but the gadgets only include a sexy Aston Martin, and his trademark silenced PP7. Thats about it in the gadget department.  <br /> <br />Acting-wise, Daniel Craig nailed it. He put aside the boo-birds, and made himself (In my opinion) the best bond yet. Yes he's blonde, yes he's not as \\"pretty\\" as Brosnan. Does he have the cool factor ala Sean Connery? Maybe...but too many Connery faithful beg to diifer. Craig is very cocky, and over-confident. He's HUGE too...and Bond's are generally not skinny, but not bulked-up like Craig is in Casino Royale. He looks more like he was ready to star in 300...but anyway, its awesome because he's tough as nails and he's a \\"guy\\" guy. On the flipside, the Bond girl is a very pretty Eva Green who actually is the best bond in recent memory. She's not star-struck by James off the bat like most of them, and her way is attractive to Bond. She is young, and elegant unlike the previous. The fact that she isn't gaga over Bond makes him like her even more, and to see him be captivated by a female is truly awesome.  <br /> <br />Overall, Casino Royale takes the dying James Bond series and wipes it clean; starts fresh ala the Batman series. This movie makes Bond a human with geniune feelings and his own problems to deal with throughout. To watch a character developing like James Bond did in this movie is fantastic. Martin Campbell comes back from directing Goldeneye which was a solid Bond film over 10 years ago. He comes back and makes one fantastic film alongside co-writter Paul Haggis (Crash, Million Dollar Baby, Flags of our Fathers). The extras on the dvd itself are very nice, and provide some cool things to watch if you have time. The video transfer was great, and the sound quality was excellent. The movie itself runs a bit long, closer to 3 hours, so give yourself plenty of time to sit down and watch this film, but I promise you it will be enjoyable and you'll want to watch it again and again.  <br /> <br />I'm Will Black, and thats my review on Casino Royale.  <br /> <br />5/5 stars
0920668372|5.0|I used to read this to the kids during the children's sermon every Mother's Day. The mom rocks her boy to sleep every night and says \\"I'll love you forever, I'll Like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.\\" It's funny when he grows up and she still does this to him every night. <br /> <br />The book has a very heartfelt and touching conclusion. There were people in the congregation who cried every time I read the story (and I'm talking about the grownups!). Maybe I'll read it again this year ....
0385512104|4.0|Very good book, well written.  Interesting to see things through the eyes of an autistic child.  Quick and easy read.
B000000OAC|5.0|This was the first Queen album that I ever had so getting it on CD is great.  \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" is an overlooked Queen gem.
0688170528|5.0|I loved this book, I couldn't put it down.  I recommend it!
0385338082|2.0|Can you keep a Secret is my 2nd read of Sophie Kinsella's novel.  The first one was \\"Confession of a Shopholic\\".  I guess the first novel was fun enough so I decided to read a 2nd one.  But, I find the author is merely repeating herself and stereotyping all her characters.  For the first time, I managed to overlook the unreal and illogical plot of Luke fall in love with Becky, just for the fun and easy read, but the 2nd time, the flawed plotline is unbearable.  In the novel, Emma seems like this ordinary city girl with mediocre intelligence and mediocre look.  So, again, the reader has no clue why this intelligent, charming and sexy multimillionaire fall for her.  I'm not saying multimillionaire should not fall in love with ordinary girl. Actually, that could make a good story, IF, there are enough reasons and justifications in the plotline to make it believable.  The foolish girl got all scared in a plane and spilled out all her stupid secrets won't do the trick.  The illogical progress of the story makes me more and more annoyed.  Emma is not a lovable character, she seems shallow, pathetic and heartless, who dumped her nice boy-friend of one year without warning and eagerly jump into a multimillionaire's bed a couple of days later.  Well, the concept is very interesting, that is, a seemingly compatible couple sometimes may not be right for each other.  But unfortunately the author didn't explore this subject any further.  Even the boyfriend is not the right one; it is too easy for Emma just to dump him like that with little hesitation.  Then sleeping with the boss and multimillionaire a couple of days later make her more loathsome.  Jack's character is vague and totally unreal, and just like some other reader said: \\"how old is he?\\"  You'd question his intelligence and capability for him to openly pursue some junior employee within his company in such a short time-frame.  He seems more like some kind of maniac who'd pursue any female.  I have not finished the bookyet, and I keep reading just because I've gone so far along and it's an easy read.  I give it 2 stars because there are some funny spots.  However, I've decided after this Sophie Kinsella is off my list.  I like chick lit, but not something that totally disrespect reader's intelligence and so totally out of real life.
1582701709|2.0|I agree with some of the reviewers who are balking at new age, self help nonsense. The notion that we exude certain vibrations that attract certain people and things in life as absolutely absurd. Does this mean that people who are alone exude bad vibes? Or poor and fat people, do they also project only fat or poverty vibrations? How about social welfare people do they fire off only welfare atoms at you. You must stay away from those kinds of people or you too will be on the dole.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I had seen this film at the movies but wanted to own it. Great acting and cast and a fun theme. I recommend it.
B00024ZAWM|5.0|This is one of the best versions of toys in the attic  that I have heard
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Great music. You  can kind of picture in your mind where the music was in the movie.
0553346687|5.0|This books will make you wealthy and wise , One of the best investment ever.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|I loved this movie right up to the end.  It could have been great.  It worked hard to deliver a profound message, but then it wimped out and decided the audience would prefer a warm-fuzzy, narcissistic, cliché and ultimately empty happy ending.  The 4 stars are because I enjoyed the movie so much up to that point, and it's easy to stop the movie early and pretend I had been given something to think about.
1400032717|5.0|before you know the story is over :)<br /><br /> The author is very intelligent and the story is very differently written
B000N6U0E2|5.0|It's nice to see Will Smith taking such a serious role, for a change, and execute it so well. I have heard my friends praising Jaden Smith's performance. Yet it's the story and Will Smith that grabbed my attention.    It's sometimes uneasy to see how Chris Gardner made ends meet in the movie and he did it all for his son. The good work of charity organizations, the people who responded to his phone calls and bought his scanners helped. (I begin to think of all those promotion phone calls I turned down.) Chris's sheer determination, perseverance and guts to  survive his 6-month internship were again not an easy act to follow. It took every bit of his intelligence to pull it off. This is a feel good movie to make us reflect how much we already have; how a little help can make a big difference to others' lives. A thought provoking movie indeed.
B000L22WTO|5.0|These versions are almost as good as the original which is now a part of memory .
B000O174CM|5.0|This definitely is the vehicle for Jennifer Hudson's success. She exudes the emotional depth and subtleties of the well-written character Effie White. I could not help admire how the numbers were cleverly arranged with no dialogue needed. The singing itself and the shots spoke it all, as \\"Family\\" demonstrated when all tried to persuade Effie to cede singing lead. Jennifer Hudson's powerful, rich, brassy voice is unforgettable - a desperate voice to be heard. Whether she was protesting being replaced by Sharon Leal in the trio - they sang \\"It's all over\\" and she sang \\"And I'm telling you I'm not going\\", or fighting for a living in \\"I'm changing\\", her performances were marvelous and unparalleled. When the Dreamgirls bade farewell in the end, she was exuberant and sang her heart out to her little darling. It is simply a delight to watch the ups and downs (or rather the downs and ups) of Effie White.     Other characters are also very watchable and their voices most creditable - Jamie Fox, Eddie Murphy, Danny Glover, Keith Robinson (as C.C. White), Anika Noni Rose, Sharon Leal, Queen Lativah. Needless to say, Beyonce Knowles paled in comparison because of her difficult role. Maybe she was too beautiful, maybe her character, Deena Jones, was too perfect and thus appeared unreal and weak when compared with the struggles of those around her. Jennifer Hudson's role as Effie White, by contrast, was all flesh and blood.     This could easily have been a movie more on Effie White and less on Deena Jones. The movie could have been more like All about Eve, placing equal emphasis on Bette Davis and Anne Baxter. Jennifer Hudson fully deserves an Oscar - not just for a Supporting Role but for a Leading Role.
B000N3AXQU|5.0|The movie was well done. He used real people, not actors, he brought back old characters, which was a nice suprise, and keep the alot of realism to the story. You really felt Rocky's pain and struggles to rid the beast inside of him. The fight was friggin' phemnoninal, no fake boxing here. Sly wanted total contact. It felt like you were watching a real fight on pay per view. This movie brought tears to my eyes 4 times already. I saw it twice in the theatres and twice at home. What a beautiful ending to a classic story. There are some nice extra's added with an alternate ending.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Although I love the Connery bond ,this is the best bond movie yet.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|To truly appreciate this film one should remember that `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' was released in '37 making it's production an incredible achievement in animation considering the overall state of the art at the time. This film was the spring board for the many Disney classics to follow in the years ahead making it a classic by that standard alone.<br /><br />However having that said, after all these years the film can still stand on its own merits. The animation is enjoyable, the soundtrack is enchanting, at times haunting and the seven dwarfs are beloved by millions around the world. It may not be technically the best of Disney's animated films but it was the benchmark of all that was to follow and still has a loyal fan base after all these years. A true classic.
0740748475|5.0|Great product ...If you love C and H You will love this collection.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Released in '89 `The Little Mermaid' marked Disney's triumphant return to the big screen. It had been thirty long years since the release of `Sleeping Beauty' (59) and a new generation of children were starving for a little modern Disney magic to call their own. Boy did they deliver! Who could've guessed at the time that `The Little Mermaid' was just a foretaste of what was to follow in the 90's.<br /><br />In my estimation `The Little Mermaid' is Disney at its very best; storyline, animation and character development are all done to perfection. Add to that Ariel, the most adorable heroine ever, Ursula, the evilest villainess to date and a soundtrack of songs you'll be humming for months and you have a classic on your hands. Definitely 5 Stars!
B00000K0DQ|4.0|The movie was suspenseful.  The reason I purchased the movie was for a project at school.  I very much enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to others.
B00005JKHN|4.0|I first viewed `Sleeping Beauty' during its original theatrical release in '59. It was a birthday present. I had just turned seven (you may now do the math). I loved it then and only recently have watched with my nineteen year old daughter at her request.<br /><br />`Sleeping Beauty' stands at the end of phase I in the history of Disney's production of feature length animation films. Following such early classics like `Snow White' (37), `Alice in Wonderland' (51) and `Peter Pan' (53) and preceding the modern masterpieces `Little Mermaid' (89), 'Beauty and the Beast' (91), `Aladdin' (92), `Pocahontas' (95) and `Mulan' (98) you can easily observe both the gains in production values from the earlier and the shortcomings in comparison with those that followed.<br /><br />Yes the characters are grossly undeveloped when judged by today's standards and the animation falls noticeable short of what can now be done, the colors are brilliant and alluring the three good fairies Flora, Flauna and Merryweather enchanting and the music memorable.<br /><br />Whether you love it or just like this film it's a piece of Disney history and should ultimately be judged by its main target audience, children.
B0000009TJ|5.0|The way Bolero flows into Zoot Allures is very clever.  In your face, Maurice, you no talent hack.  And imagine the guitars of Stairway To Heaven done in horns.   And rigt in the middle of Zombie Wolf, Joe Satriani's evil twin clone does some of his best work ever.  The band at it's peak, plus a jab or two at Jimmy Swaggart during his post-sinning period.  What more do you need?
B00003CX8Y|5.0|`Beauty and the Beast' `91 is yet another juggernaut of the  animated Disney classics that were released in the `90's. The list included; `Aladdin' in `92, `Pocahontas' in '95 and `Mulan' in '98. It's a close call, but this one is possibly the best of the four with 'Aladdin' featuring the madcap voice of Robin Williams a close second.<br /><br />`Beauty and the Beast' scores high marks in every category; storyline, character development, animation and cinematography, sound and music that says with you long after the final credits roll by. The only possible negative I can come up with about the release of this particular version is the inclusion of the song `To be Human Again.' It is rather redundant and definitely not equal to the caliber of the rest of the soundtrack. It's inclusion only serves to detract rather than enhance an otherwise perfectly done tale.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|If you've seen all the previous Bond movies, if you've read any of the bond novels by Ian Fleming, then this is just another action movie by our 21st century standards. Our \\"NEW\\" Bond (in my opinion) does NOT, I repeat does NOT capture the true flavor of the Bond personality. He's a fast shooter, but other than that, he didn't act like the bond we know. For example, he allowed himself to be poisened by a drink at the Casino (not careful enough for 007!). He over trusted his lady partner with millions of dollars. He's too serious and even harsh, no Bond usual charm. For the new generation that has not seen Sean Connery's best and Roger Moore's best and even Brosnan's best, this maybe a good action movie. I think the new Bond (Daniel Craig) is a fine actor, but definately not a credible James Bond! Also, what happened to the beautiful Bond movies Blondes? there aren't any here!!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|It was just a plain old DVD, im not sure if it was suppossed to have a chapter index inside, but it wasnt there...quality of movie was great though!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Not your Father's James Bond to say the least. I grew up with James Bond, Seeing Dr. No First Run when I was just 11, and Have seen all of them except the other Casino Royale (Woody Allen Spoof).  Much as I thought that they could never bring Phantom of the Opera to the screen, and was blown away by the success they achieved, I was similary impressed with Casino Royale.  By the end of the film you can understand why James Bond was the way he was.  From Dr. No onward.  Daniel Craig fit the part. It is almost impossible to put him with the others who have played the part, but he is similar to Sean Connery, for the gritty dangerous person who no one knew at the time and would take over the part.  I am very impressed. I am anxious to see what they do with him next.  I like the new direction, or should I say the new starting point.  There is room for this Bond beside Connery, Dalton, and Brosnan.  Moore is a nice guy but he isn't in these guys league, nor was Lazenby but maybe only because he was not given much of a chance. May the next one be as textured and engrossing. and don't cut one minute from it.
1594200823|5.0|Michael Pollan's book, Omnivore's Dilemma, addresses one of the most fundamental questions that have bothered humans sinct the beginning of time: \\"What should I eat for dinner?\\"  To fully understand the concepts, Pollan explores three of the major ways that people today gather food.  He explores industrial agriculture, the \\"organic\\" farming system, and the classic hunter-gatherer method.  With each method, Pollan looks at the social, ehtical, the political and the environmental ramifications of the impact that meal can have.  <br />   Pollan has a unique style of writing that i have never previously seen.  He tends to pack in a ton of information into each sentence but also using humor and wit.  Pollan is one of the cleverest writers of the 21st century that i have laid my hands on.  With Pollan's help, i have become more aware of what goes into my food and i consciously think twice before i eat a product.  Pollan has now become one of my favorite authors.
B000ILYYJE|5.0|Yes even having to pay the full price from Amazon (and not setling for a second-hand used item at a much lower price), it was definitely worth paying and waiting for this box set to arrive all the way to Japan. Highly recommended for all Doors Fans!!
096798467X|5.0|We built an earthern oven using Kiko's first book. We wanted to replace that book with this third edition. I was pleased to see the new material that was added. In this book, all the separate pieces of information were gathered and each placed into its own section, which makes it easier to find all the information related to a specific process that I'm using on during the large process of oven building. I also appreciate the history and the philosophy that Kiki intersperses in his chapters. <br /> <br />The chapter on bread baking by Hannah is a new and welcomed addition. <br /> <br />Thank you for another great book!!
0743496728|5.0|This book was excellent. I have already read some of her books but this one kept me on the edge of my seat. A lot of what happened in the book I can totally relate to when it comes to what happens in highschool, very realistic in that part.<br /><br />It did seem like she wrote the book a little to fast and seem like there were some errors in the write but that didn't keep me from reading the book and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and I just couldn't stop reading. I got in trouble sometimes because someone was talking to me and I would be to indepth in to the book to realize they were talking to me. The book really gets you thinking as well.<br /><br />The only thing i didn't really like was the ending. It was just kind of plopped there it didn't seem to summarize the ending as much as I would like, and there was one character that I didn't like the ending for as well. But! I am certainly looking forward to the next book she writes!
B000NA77YO|4.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />Because the Ozzy Osbourne era of Black Sabbath is regarded by most fans and critics as the band's golden era, the Dio-led era ('80-'82, '92) is sometimes not given the credit and praise it deserves. Because the first six Sabbath albums are so (rightfully) highly regarded, it's easy to forget that the band floundered towards the end of the 70s. Releasing two commercial and critical failures, (1976's \\"Technical Ecstasy\\" and 1978's \\"Never Say Die\\") being blown away by opening act Van Halen, as well as the loss of vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, by 1980 Black Sabbath was left for dead.<br /><br />But just when everyone thought the band was through, Black Sabbath reemerged with a new singer, former Rainbow frontman Ronnie James Dio, and the band was given a second era to add to their legacy.<br /><br />Ronnie James Dio's creative imagery and themes, veteran status as a heavy metal frontman, and killer, killer pipes were exactly what the band needed. The Dio-led era of Black Sabbath created two classics, \\"Heaven and Hell\\" (1980) and \\"Mob Rules,\\" (1980) which proved to be as good as anything from their legendary first six albums with Osbourne. More focused than the last two Ozzy-era albums and armed with some of the band's most memorable, well-written songs, \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"Mob Rules\\" stand as two of the best albums in the band's catalogue.<br /><br />Alas, the Dio-led Sabbath proved to be short-lived. After feuding over the mix of the band's \\"Live Evil\\" (1982) Dio and drummer Vinnie Appice (who had then replaced original drummer Bill Ward, playing on \\"Mob Rules\\") left the band to form the successful, aptly named, Dio.<br /><br />For the next decade Dio and Black Sabbath (with numerous line-up changes, at times with only guitarist Tony Iommi) soldiered on, until finally reuniting for the \\"Dehuminizer\\" (1992) album and tour. Although not nearly as strong as \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"Mob Rules,\\" \\"Dehumanizer\\" was a decent album, featuring at least a couple great songs. But again the Dio-led lineup proved to be short-lived. Sabbath went on to resume work with singer Tony Martin (who had played on many of the band's post-Dio albums) and then Ozzy Osbourne, while Dio sporadically recorded and toured.<br /><br />2007 sees another Sabbath/Dio reunion (now calling themselves \\"Heaven & Hell\\" as the Ozzy Osbourne led-band is still together and on hiatus). To commemorate the new reunion tour, the band has released a new compilation, \\"Black Sabbath: The Dio Years\\" (2007).<br /><br />Although one could argue for some songs in favor of others, (i.e., the best cuts from \\"Dehumanizer\\" are left off in place of weaker ones) \\"The Dio Years\\" does a pretty good job of capturing the best of the Dio-led era. The sound quality of these songs is superb, sounding crisp and fresh, and is a huge improvement over the quality of the original CDs (which badly need to be remastered and reissued).<br /><br />Two of the new songs, the sluggish \\"The Devil Cried,\\" and \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" are good enough, but not all that great. The hard-rocking \\"Ear in the Wall,\\" however, is fantastic and shows that the Dio-led Sabbath still has something to offer.<br /><br />While the track-list could have been slightly better, \\"The Dio Years\\" is a near definitive collection of the Dio-led era and is definitely worth buying for the outstanding sound quality alone.st a couple great songs.

B000MGUZMU|4.0|Fantastic album. One of the best albums that will come out all year, but I was hoping for a bit more angsty weirdness on Neon Bible.<br /><br />\\"Neon Bible\\" is definitely more mature and consistent than \\"Funeral,\\" and maybe that is why it is not as exciting. It is a developed album and so well orchestrated that it does not burst into your heart, but rather burns slowly for the full 47 minutes. One can immediately recognize the content and know you are hearing something great, but that doesn't mean I love it.<br /><br />The characters and passion that exploded in sound on \\"Funeral\\" won me over immediately with the grand weirdness of it all. \\"Neon Bible\\" has it's moments(\\"Keep the Car Running\\")where I begin to be swept into the salvation story, but it is just not as pervasively seductive as Funeral's themes of connection and community.
0007205236|4.0|McCourt's childhood memoirs make for a superb read. A number of people are greatly saddened by the abhorrent conditions in which McCourt, his family, and many, many others had to suvive. Alcoholic father unable to hold down a job, abject poverty, deplorable living conditions, mother doing everything she can to put food on the table and limited clothes on their backs, death of siblings, church washing its hands of them to avoid embarassment, begging for food, just the daily struggle in mind numbing poverty. Through it all the telling of the bigger story: the strength of humanity in the face of adversity. And here is where McCourt delivers...even in the most desparate of situations the will to struggle on wins the day (people are facing these conditions, and much worse, elsewhere in the world today)...through it all there is the ability to draw from the well of humour, companionship, and pure bloody mindedness.   If you are shocked, stunned, depressed by what MCCourt relates then I'd recommend you go and visit some of the Third World countries - McCourts story is their reality.  A wonderfully written book. Is it all true? Having spoken with someone that knows him personally then No - hence it being labelled memoirs. Does that detract from it being a good read? No. Pay heed to the circumstances of poverty and squalor that the book relates but most importantly take a leaf from McCourt and laugh.   A superb book.
0307383415|3.0|There were three major parts to Barack Obama's story.  His childhood in Hawai and his journey to Kenya were interesting. His work in Chicago as a activist was unimpressive and the narrative dragged and was confusing in this section. His  grandparents on his mother's side were the stable force in his childhood  and were very accepting of their biracial grandson.  Barack's mother seemed to pursue her own interests. His father was not in the picture.  The strongest part of Barack's story was his meeting with his African relatives and his reflections on this
B0006A9FMI|5.0|I don't think it is fair that everyone is rating this 1 star because of the subtitles. The hearing impaired subtitles do not appear as often as other reviewers make it seem.<br /><br />Theres about 1 or 2 every 5 mins and they are very brief.<br /><br />The animation and the story line is fantastic. Toshio Suzuki from Studio Ghibli was brought on board as producer and his effort reflects that.<br /><br />This is one of the most beautiful looking anime around and we all know that anime is always better in Japanese with subtitles then English dubbed.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|This was probably the worst Bond ever. The bounding at the beginning belongs in a Superman or Batman movie. Bond would never, rental or not, drive a small Ford. I've been a Bond fan from day 1 and bought this to complete the collection but it doesn't belong with the rest.
0743496728|5.0|I put \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" on my mental list of best books I have read before I was even finished reading it! This is by far one of the best books I have read and in a long time. It builds very slowly and intricately, almost like Jodi Picoult is weaving a web. I loved how she went between the past, present and future and gave little glimpses of the characters until finally at the end you have this whole amazing and unbelievable clear picture.  <br /> <br />Not once did this story lose my interest or did I find myself reading quickly to get through it. I read and savored every moment of this book and was somewhat sad when it was over. My most favorite quality of the story is that it is seen from each characters eyes and you get to see each point of view seperately. I found myself not knowing who to empathize with the most.  <br /> <br />I think this book would make an excellent movie. Hopefully it will get picked up and the world can see the brilliance of Nineteen Minutes on the big screen!
B000LAZDQA|3.0|I started hearing about \\"Shortbus\\" quite a few years ago (maybe 5) and didn't think much of it. It's, essentially, a movie that will be seen less than the average porno that has a bunch of non-actors having real sex. Before this movie debuted, another movie called \\"9 Songs\\" came out. This was about a couple, non-actors, who went to concerts and had real sex. That's it. It was bashed deservedly and I expected the same for Shortbus. Oddly enough, this film got fairly good reviews and continues to get praise right here on Amazon. The movie is written and directed (although the cast is responsible for the storylines) by John Cameron Mitchell, who is probably most famous for writing, directing, and starring in \\"Hedwig & the Angry Inch,\\" which is one of my least favorite films of all time. \\"Shortbus\\" contains some of the same visuals that makes a lot of people like that film, but has even more homosexual content. I don't want to sound like a perv, but I rented this movie because I heard it had graphic sex and I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. The first 5 minutes of the film is nothing but graphic sex and some of it is a bit disturbing. What the character James does is highly unlikely. The film just weaves through various relationships (the title comes from the name of a sex club they all attend). For a quick synopsis: There's James and Jamie, a gay couple going through a rough patch in their relationship. There's Sofia and Rob, a married couple also hitting a rough patch. Sofia, a sex therapist, is unable to experience an orgasm. Then there's the dominatrix Severin, trying to find meaningful communication with someone. Ceth, a gay frequenter of Shortbus, who is one of the most annoying people I have ever had to watch act. There's also a stalker, who watches James from across the street in his high-rise apartment. The film is, without a doubt, realistic for the most part. It's massively better than the aforementioned \\"9 Songs,\\" but it's not a very good movie as a whole. It's kind of disturbing, but don't get me wrong...It's not porn, nor erotica. The way the film deals with relationships is realistic and some of the sex seems realistic (it is real, just more movie-like than one would expect)...As for the end of the film and many other scenes, it's a bit pretentious. The ending especially, which is both annoying and completely unrealistic...But look, I'm one of the only reviewers on here mentioning this stuff about the movie. I don't know what kind of audience to recommend this too, so I'm just stating my opinion and leaving the decision to you. I just, personally, didn't think it was a great film and I will not be watching it again. <br /> <br />GRADE: C-
B000NDIAWO|3.0|Apparently over 2,000,000 copies sold is just not enough for superstar diva, Beyonce Knowles, who's 2003 debut disc, Dangerously In Love, shifted over twice that figure. Despite being one of the most successful releases of 2006, Knowles and her management plan to not only re-release the album, but add a \\"3rd chapter\\", a live disc to come out later this year. With it's heavy beats, aggressive vocals, unique titles, and effortlessly addicitive hooks, does B'Day fair better or worse with a few added tracks?  <br /> <br />Disc 1 opens with Shakira duet, \\"Beautiful Liar\\", a sultry mix of latino-pop and r&b flavors, but with a video that overshadows the song itself (and makes you realize that the song may not have been as dazzling as you first imagined). Well it might find a better fit on the re-release of Shakira's Oral Fixation Vol. 2 (2005/2006), this \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" sibling is still catchy all over. It's no surprise when horribly overplayed #1 megahit \\"Irreplaceable\\" occupies the second spot, but you're thrown for a loop when the more \\"out there\\" original B'Day tracks, \\"Greenlight\\", with it's so-so verses but increasingly catchy chorus, and the sexed-up slow jam, \\"Kitty Kat\\" take the next 2 seats. And once again, in a very interesting method of beginning an album, Knowles throws in her rapper boyfriend, Jay-Z's \\"Kingdom Come\\" album track, \\"Welcome To Hollywood\\" (which she's featured on quite a bit of). While the title sounds promising, you find yourself puzzled about 30 seconds in, on whether or not the song should be sent packing back to Jay-Z's disc, or still sitting on the shelves of Columbia Records collecting dust.  <br /> <br />Finally, the album has the sense knocked back into it, and the simple but terrifically pumping track (\\"Upgrade U\\", yet again ft. Jay-Z), starts up with just Beyonce's vocals and a beat. The intricately twisting lyrics will continue to amaze you all the way into a new track, \\"Flaws And All\\". The non-belted half-ballad will mystify you forthe full 4:10, and becomes increasingly enchanting throughout, with a rather floating effect. But with a hit, there had to be a slight miss. The cover song, \\"Still In Love (Kissing You)\\", bores in comparison, but does have a few good moments half way through.  <br /> <br />Then comes a flood of old B'Day tracks, all of which still perform to high standards. Despite \\"Get Me Bodied\\" being unnecessarily turned into an extended mix (with a tedious extra 1:30 tailgating the brilliant beats), \\"Freakum Dress\\", \\"Suga Mama\\", \\"Deja Vu\\", \\"Ring The Alarm\\", \\"Resentment\\", and \\"Listen\\" are pitch-perfect. However, with hidden track, \\"World Wide Woman\\", it's clear why Columbia would want it \\"hidden\\" as it's a big mess of a miss, sounding like a good leftover track from her first album, but completely out of place on this release.  <br /> <br />Disc 2, where Beyonce naively takes on several spanish efforts of previous tracks, turns out to be nearly pointless. \\"Amor Gitano\\", the only new track on this disc, lacks anything special, even with a feature from Alexandro Fernandez. And with Spanish versions and remixes of tracks like \\"Listen\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\", \\"Irreemplazable\\" (the spanish version of, you guessed it, \\"Irreplaceable\\") is the only one that is striking when switched in language. But maybe that's just because it puts a fresh spin on what some call the best track of Knowles career.  <br /> <br />A plus is the paper-produced simple, yet \\"cute\\" packaging, but it seems that B'Day may have been better left alone, with the exception of \\"Flaws And All\\" (which you should just download, as opposed to buying the whole re-release). Maybe Beyonce should just try and get it right on the first try and leave it at that, instead of possibly poisoning the whole idea all together, with an over-dose of new tracks and new releases.  <br /> <br />Note: If you don't own the original release of B'Day, you'll probably find this pretty pleasing. But for those who do have the original, this is notmuch to brag about.  <br /> <br />Best Old Tracks: \\"Irreplaceable\\", \\"Suga Mama\\", \\"Upgrade U\\", \\"Freakum Dress\\", \\"Resentment\\"  <br />Best New Tracks: \\"Beautiful Liar\\", \\"Flaws And All\\"  <br /> <br />Original Release Score: 8.0  <br />Re-Release Score: 6.75
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|I've never really listened to Incubus. I heard their first album, which I didn't like, but then I saw the music video for \\"Anna Molly\\" fell in love with the song and bought the album. My knowledge of Incubus is small, but this is a great album. Way better than their first anyway. I need to listen to their others, but this could even be their best. \\"Light Grenades\\" boasts 13 tracks, 10 of which are 5 star songs...It's also interesting to hear how much they've progressed musically since their first album. When I first heard Brandon Boyd sing, he sounded like Anthony Kiedis back when RHCP first came out. On this album his voice has matured and he's now capable of singing the pain-filled, melodic songs that he and his band writes. The album is very melodic, with very catchy hooks and some interesting ways of making music. Chris Kilmore plays instruments I've never even heard of and it sounds great. Anyway, here's the run down on the songs: <br /> <br />5-Star: <br />A Kiss to Send Us Off, Dig, Anna Molly, Love Hurts, Light Grenades, Oil & Water, Diamonds & Coal, Rogues, Paper Shoes, and Pendulous Threads. <br /> <br />4-Star: <br />Earth to Bella Pt. 1 & Earth to Bella Pt. 2 <br /> <br />3-Star: <br />Quicksand <br /> <br />Incubus isn't the strongest band in the lyrics department, but \\"Love Hurts\\" and \\"Pendulous Threads\\" have some pretty good lyrics. Rogues, Anna Molly, and Diamonds & Coal rank as the catchiest songs on the album. Dig is just a fantastic song. Even if you're not really into Incubus, you should check out this album...It's really good. It's made me a fan anyway. If you're already an Incubus fan, I have no doubt in my mind that you'll love this album. <br />GRADE: B+ <br />
B00000IFP6|5.0|One man's view:  Amazing! Every one of these is full of energy, joy and \\"snap.\\" The sense of exuberance makes all a pleasure.

B000JLTRJ0|1.0|My father, my friend mandy and i watched this movie last night. we were all very disappointed. we thought the movie wasn't realistic. we watched the news and saw all the firefighters and police officers running into the buildings trying to help the people. in this \\"movie\\" we saw them leisurely walking around, even stopping to have nice conversations with each other about what they thought was happening. we were really disappointed with the search scene.  it made the men and women of our country look like quitters because it was getting dark. we were under the impression that they search through the night. at least that's what we saw on the news. guess we were wrong. all together i would have to say i'm glad i borrowed this movie from a friend instead of wasting my money buying or renting it.
0743496728|5.0|This is one of Jodi Picoult's best ever novels. I was enthralled right from the first page. Her amazing ability to bring the characters to life and involve the reader in their situations makes it impossible to put the novel down. In this story, the timely plot makes it a definite read.
B0001CCXY8|4.0|This was a pretty good album, better than most of their recent stuff, and you have to love the cover art.  Brutal isn't it?
0375704027|5.0|i just had read \\"The Bell Jar\\" two days before, and picked up \\"Norwegian Wood\\" without really thinking about it.  i didn't realize mental illness figured so prominently in this one as well.   <br /> <br />i'd grown up in japan and remember hearing about the book \\"Noruwei no Mori\\" that everyone was talking about.  i finally know what all the fuss was about.   <br /> <br />i've never heard the beatles song, though.  i'll have to go and listen to it now.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Like a few other reviewers, I wasn't a big Tool fan.  However, after Aenema and 10,000 Days, I'm convinced that this has to be one of the hardest working bands around.  10,000 Days has to be one of the coolest CD's I've ever owned and that is saying that without having listened to the music yet.  Bands try gimicks and new sounds and they change their images often.  However, Tool seems to be just about fusing art and music into one quality package every time.  I'm can't wait to see if their shows are just as great.
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|I bought this DVD and CD set because it is a demonstration of human kindness from people who really cared. Nowhere on this DVD can you see the ego of these music legends. They played for the love of music and also to help out people who were in need. <br /> <br />George Harrison made this concert happen because he genuinely wanted to help the people of Bangladesh. I was born many years after the concert but it struck me how kind people were in the 1970's to want to help a bunch of people who really had nothing. <br /> <br />I am also a Bengali and a high school teacher in the US. I use the concert in my classes to show examples of human kindness and a willingness of Westerners to give back to the poor. The cover of the DVD speaks volumes and really makes an impact on anyone who looks at it. I was sadden and heart broken that when George Harrison died the Bangladeshi government did not send a letter of condolence to George Harrison's family or that there were no steps taken to honor the fantastic work done by George Harrison for the Bangladeshi people. So on behalf of a grateful nation and Bengali's everywhere, thank you George for the fantastic concert, music and your love for a nation of people who needed it. <br />

B000GY729M|2.0|After the dust has settled from the hype of Sam's Town's innitial release, it is unfortunately dissapointing. After such a brilliant debut cd, the killers appear to hit a sophmore slump. The first single When You Were Young sounds like reminance of Hot Fuss and similiar to Mr. Brightside. Definitely the stand out track on the album, Bones and Bling are decent songs but the depth drops off after that. Not only are the riffs and rythems dismal, the vocals and lyrics are not up to par to Hot Fuss. It feels as though they rushed this album by trying to ride the wave of their debut. The Killers need to put some more time into their next album, rather than produce such dribble every two years.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I loved this cd and was not dissappointed.It is exactly what I expected.I love her style ,and will be looking forward to the next cd.
B000001IPL|5.0|Arguably one of the most influential rock albums of the 90s by one of the best bands. Smash, easily Offspring's best album to date came out at a time when Nirvana's Nevermind and Green Day's Dookie albums rocked the radio. Definitely all classics, worthy of 5 stars. Smash is raw energy in every one of Dexters vocals and Noodles' guitar riffs. Relentless fast paced hard hitting tracks that can get you pumped for anything you do, not a weak song on the cd. A** kickers like Bad Habit (the whole thing is about road rage, you dont hear that much), the popular Self Esteem, and my favorite It'll Be A Long Time. Through and through an iconic masterpiece. If you dont have this cd, go get it, NO EXCEPTIONS. Anyways \\"it's time to relax and you know what that means a glass of wine your favorite easy chair and ofcourse this compact disc playing on your home stereo\\".
0316010669|5.0|In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell offers us a fascinating survey of recent research in neuroscience and psychology. Much of the book is an examination of \\"thin-slicing,\\" which Gladwell defines as \\"rapid cognition . . . the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience.\\" When we experience gut-level responses, form a first impression, or make a snap judgment, we are thin-slicing, making a decision outside of consciously controlled logical processes. <br /> <br />Late in the book, Gladwell describes Blink as \\"a journey into the wonders of our unconscious,\\" and as a reader moves through his various case studies, you can see why that characterization is fitting. But Gladwell's enthusiasm is always grounded in seriousness. \\"We have, as human beings, a storytelling problem,\\" he writes. \\"We're a bit too quick to come up with explanations for things we don't really have an explanation for.\\" The book's case studies, especially the ones on communication patterns between married couples and on war games, are surprising and disturbing, and frequently contain public-policy ramifications. <br /> <br />The brain is a chemical and physical marvel, and Gladwell's balanced account of thin-slicing, which often provides better results than our conscious deliberations but which also exposes us to the errors and damage of mistaken conclusions and subtle discrimination, only deepens our respect for its complexity. <br /> <br />Blink presents scientific research in clear and compelling language. Gladwell's curiosity, enthusiasm, and humor permeate the book, and idealistic intellectuals should delight in his call to use \\"practical problem solving,\\" grounded in our understanding of how our thinking actually works, to address social ills such as racially biased criminal convictions. <br /> <br />As a reminder of the frequent flaws of conscious decisions and an introduction to the potential of the brain's unconscious power, this bookis highly recommended. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Important message for everyone.
B000M4RG42|4.0|I learned much from watching Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers.  I did not know that there were actually two flag raisings atop Mount Sarabachi, that three of the men that took part in the \\"second\\" flag raising embarked on a nationwide bondraising tour effort, or that families were confused as to whom was actually photographed in the famous photo. The battle scenes in the film are grim reminders of how brutal, violent, and unforgiven war can be.  The Iwo Jima landscape looked like the surface of the moon.  I cannot imagine the courage and valor that it must have taken for U.S. servicemen to advance on a sulphurous, barren island that Japanese troops were literally entrenched in.  Director Eastwood holds nothing back in transporting viewers to the surreal battlefield known as Iwo Jima-5 stars here.  The glimpse into the preparations, psyche, and nervous anticipation of young men preparing for the assault on this 5 mile island of hell also warrants-5 stars.  What was a bit disappointing was the back and forth editing between the 3 remaining flag raisers lives as posterboy heros for the U.S. war bond effort and their roles as soldiers on Iwo Jima.  For instance what actually became of the soldiers that hoisted the first flag? Wouldn't they feel compelled to tell the press that it was their platoon that first raised the flag?  Also the film never really clarifies the confusion over the soldier who was thought to be one of the six flag raisers. Overall, Flags of Our Fathers is a compelling film that shows the reseliency of the Japanese forces, the machinations of politics and the press behind the U.S. WW II effort, and the plight of the brave men who served our country so valiantly.
B000001ESN|5.0|Consider this a 4.5 star review. <br /> <br />Permanent Waves is one of Rush's best albums.  This is a total 180 degree change in direction from the prior album, Hemispheres; the songs on this album are much more accessible and radio friendly.  Geddy Lee's singing also started to be singing, rather than screaming, starting with this one.  Even though this is a 27 year old album, it still sounds fresh and current. Every single song on this album is a winner (my personal favorites are \\"Freewill\\" and \\"Jacob's Ladder\\").  I think the only negative about Permanent Waves is that you can start to feel the limits of Terry Brown's production abilities starting on this album (which is why Rush dropped him two albums later).  Anyway, this is a classic album and highly recommended for any fan of good rock music.
B00007GZQI|3.0|This is dark comedy with surprisingly famous actors making cameos thruout the movie.  It should be by todays standards listed as 'R' rated for BN/AC/AL but very brief.  The overall story line is slow but almost believable. It reflects the 60's with it's theme & music.  It was a almost a Beatles style cult film.  Everytime I hear \\"If you want it here it is, come and get it\\" I think of this film when I saw it in the theatre in 1970.  It was fun to go back!  Carl age 52
B00005JPLU|4.0|This is a movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen.  For history scholars that look for accuracy in the documentation of the battle between the Spartans and the Persians, think again. Afterall, the captive audience is never intended for the privileged few. For those of us that had seen Robert Rodriquez's rendition of Sin City, 300's presentation is arguably more poetic or romantic with its brown grainy hue.  Every frames seemed to be well defined and planned & they are achingly beautiful to watch. Certain battle scenes defied reality such as 300 Spartans literally pushing back hordes of Persian warriors in the thousands; giant mutants, elephants, rhinoceroses added into the mix to defeat the gallant 300s until the Spartans were betrayed by one of their own. There were certain scenes reminding me of Hunchback of Notre Dame, Lord of the Rings, & even Gladiator. One must always remember to regard 300 as an entertainment movie but not a factual movie.  The reason being when Spartans fought for freedom & they spoke of individual liberty in here, in reality, Spartans kept slaves themselves (ratio 8 Helots to 1 Spartan). Perhaps, the Queen was given a bigger acting role so as to soften the over-the-top masculinity of this movie.  To make audience feel and have empathy towards the characters, at times, there needs to be a villain or two that made us genuinely vouch for the underdog & in this instances, it comes in the form of King Xerxes from Persia (modern day Iran).  If we were Iranians ourselves, perhaps, we would understand why they regard 300 as a propoganda to undermine its glorious history and culture. Gerald Butler once again proves his versatility in playing varying & memorable roles. David Wenham, an Australian is effective as the narrator to this movie. Kudos go to the whole team for being able to come out with such a slick production especially when the actors and actresses are only been given a backdrop of green or blue screen & imagination to bring 300to the fore.  Once again, what's the story with the English accent in drama piece?  Highly recommended and an unmissable experience!
032147404X|5.0|This is a terrific beginner's book on Photography.  It doesn't teach much about photographic theory but the author makes it clear from the beginning that is not his goal. I already understood the basics of exposure, focal lengths, etc. and still found it very enlightening.  It offers over a hundred tips and techniques covering topics from shooting sharper pictures to photographing weddings in an easy-to-read format.   It's most useful as a reference that you can refer to quickly about particular topics or situations but it also stands up to continuous reading if you want to go through it from cover to cover.

B000MCH5P4|4.0|This movie was on the screen sometimes ago in Switzerland.Much to say that it's not a bad movie at all for  those of Brad Pitt's fans.The story relates more to how careless some adults can be in guarding little ones.On some opinians,not mine anyway,the little ones should be cared by those who have knowledges,not by those who are just bigger.<br />My nephew called me that evening and said,\\"Don't you want to see Bad Pritt?\\".I said,\\"No,my dear,it's Brad Pitt!!\\"
B000NDIAWO|3.0|This album this time around I must say was done much better. Some of the songs I must admit took a little time for them to grow on me but I like most of the songs off the Deluxe Edition. Since I am from Puerto Rican decent I listen to the spanish songs and I must say she is not that bad. \\"Amor Gitano\\" was my favorite. When two months ago I heard it on the soap opera I fell instantly in love but by the time they decided to come out with the CD I lost interest in the song but it still is a beautiful song though. But sometimes I wonder about the spanish songs. Jennifer Lopez after all had her whole spanish album come out a week before hers so I sometimes think it was a competion of some sorts which I don't understand but that's the music biz for ya. I think though it was a bit rediclous to have like 5 different versions of \\"Beautiful Liar\\" I mean it would have been good if it was one version in enlgish one is spanish and just leave it at that. To have one song done by her so called alter-ego \\"Sasha\\" was kind of cheesy. I do love the CD case in comes in and the CD booklet is beautiful as well. I can now donate my other plain B-Day CD and this Deluxe Edition is a keeper. So when it comes down to it's not really bad it's a good CD with some good songs. Also make sure you pick up the video album(DVD) that's in Walmart cause she made every video for every song. I mean not EVERY song but most of the songs on B-Day. This CD is also good for when you are taking a long drive you pop this in and it's pleasent to listen to while your on the road.

B000L43AN4|5.0|Nobody does grizzled and world-weary quite like Tom Waits, and coming off 2004's incredible Real Gone, the mammoth three-disc collection Orphans is yet more proof of his bizarre genius.  Even putting aside the abundance of great music it contains, it is, if nothing else, a fitting tribute to Waits's persistently uncommercial, marketing-be-damned approach to his music.  Comprised of a whopping 54 songs (both Waits originals and covers) and clocking in at about three hours, Orphans is vintage Waits from beginning to end-unvarnished, unconventional, and uncompromising.  Given the enormous amount of variety to be found here, everyone's going to have their personal favorites, but whichever tracks one prefers there's no denying that Orphans makes the perfect testament to Waits's endless creativity, stinging wit and gritty, PhD-in-life sensibility.<br /><br />Waits has long been a a man of many personas-demented carnival barker, old testament prophet, Jesus freak, depression-era bluesman-and even more than his more traditional albums Orphans shows off his chameleonic nature to the fullest extent.  With its ample available space, Orphans allows Waits to induldge in genre exercises ranging from rockabilly (Lie To Me); to baroque pop (Little Drop of Poison); to swamp blues (Buzz Fledderjohn); to gospel (Lord I've been changed) without ever sounding like just an imitator of his varied influences.  That said, Waits is still at his best when he dwells in a musical territory all his own, be it noisy, free-form experimentation or more reflective, sparsely instrumented balladry.<br /><br />Each disc brings with its own unique feel, with the first one feeling the most like a proper Waits album in the vein of such all-encompassing classics as Rain Dogs and Bone Machine.  Waits gets his classic-rock fix taken are of early with the scorching Low Down, whose big, brash guitar riffs wouldn't sound out of place in the '60's.  The clamorous percussion and dizzying time signatures of Fish in the Jailhouse should please fans of Waits's more eccentric side, or just those like this writer who crave something abrasive and weird.  Providing a sharp contrast to these tunes, but still very much in line with Waits's overall approach, are the downcast resignation of the bluesy, guitar-driven Road to Piece (a seven-minute examination of the conflict in Israel) and the closing lament of Rains on Me.<br /><br />The ballad-heavy second disc, while occasionally a tad forgettable, is still home to some of the most brilliant material of Waits's career.  The triumphant Take Care of All of My Children is driven by a stirring, martial drum beat, while the following Down There by the Train manages to expertly combine sadness, regret, and hope through Waits's singularly poetic lyrical imagery (\\"There's no eye for an eye/There's no tooth for a tooth/I saw Judas Iscariot carryin' John Wilkes Booth\\"-brilliant).  In somewhat of a curveball for Waits, Never Let Go is inspiring and poignant in its straightforward message of devotion.  There's also a great, booze-sodden lament in Goodnight Irene, which finds Waits's nicotine-stained voice at its most raw and unhinged.<br /><br />The third disc is a nod to every side of the schizophrenic last two decades of Waits's career, with unstructured noise explorations (the mutant jazz-blues-rock workout Heigh Ho is hard-edged and ominous even for Waits) to a slew of spoken-word pieces to some more tender ballads.  Waits starts off the disc by breaking out his classic rasp on the delightfully malevolent What Keeps Mankind Alive, and backs himself up with some inspired vocal beat-boxing on the Spidey's Wild Ride and King Kong.  The latter track is especially interesting, with Waits's pained wail augmented by some ear-piercing guitar squeals and a subterranean bass line as he declaims the tragic story of, well, King Kong, with all the gravity of a character delivering the closing monologue of a Shakespearean tragedy.use should please fans of Waits's more eccentric side, or just those like this writer who crave something abrasive and weird.

B0001WANCM|3.0|\\"Field of Dreams\\" another Kevin Costner ([[ASIN:630460291X Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves (Snap Case)]]) baseball movie, was originally released in 1989, and is now nearly twenty years old.  Most viewers would agree that it's held up pretty well, and is still one of the best baseball movies around.<br /><br />It is, of course, the story of that famous Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella (It's not heaven, it's Iowa, folks), who regrets his abrasive relationship with his late, baseball-loving, father. One day, he hears a voice telling him: \\"If you build it, he will come.\\"  He therefore believes he's being told to plow under his prime cornfield and plant a baseball diamond.  So he does. The voice then sends him to Boston to find reclusive 1960's cult writer Terence Mann (James Earl Jones,[[ASIN:B00066FABM The Great White Hope]]), and to Minnesota to find mysterious \\"Doc\\" Graham (Burt Lancaster,[[ASIN:B000056HEE Elmer Gantry]].)  The baseball diamond will, we know, call forth somehow, from somewhere, some historic ballplayers --principally the disgraced (for throwing the World Series, to the benefit of some notorious gamblers, including \\"Funny Girl\\" Fanny Brice's husband Arnie Rothstein) Chicago White Sox of 1919.  They are led by famed \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta,[[ASIN:B000LPS4BG GoodFellas [Blu-ray]]]; shooting sparks in this portrayal).  Costner's character is supported in all this, despite the fact that it's driving his family into bankruptcy, by his loyal wife Annie ( Amy Madigan, [[ASIN:B0000VV4AY Nowhere to Hide]]). The movie's clearly well-cast, though, after paying Jones, Lancaster, and Liotta, in addition to Costner, the producers probably weren't willing to spend big bucks on casting wifey, as well.  Nevertheless, Madigan acquits herself honorably.<br /><br />The film is generally considered a guy thing, and, in fact, a guys' weepie, but it ain't necessarily so.  It's crisp as a new ten dollar bill, moves at speed like a good fastball, and is, in reality, quite witty, as was noticed upon its release.  It's also got a resonant subtext.  Kinsella, we're specifically told, is actually neither a farmer, nor an Iowa native, by family background; his dad worked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  The Kinsellas are characterized as left over 1960's hippies,  He wears an old University of California Berkeley t-shirt, there's a peace sign on the old Volkswagen van, and Annie's big PTA speech would do any Berkeley-educated mom proud.  When Costner tracks down the Jones character, the writer sprays him with Flit, probably not distributed since the 60's, and tells him to get back to the 60's while he still can: it's a frequently-cited scene.  In Minnesota, Costner experiences a little more time travel -- he finds himself in 1972.  \\"The Godfather\\" is playing. And there's a poster hung by the Committee to Re-Elect the President--Nixon, that is-- giving us CREEP, of Watergate notoriety.<br /><br />We're told that \\"Shoeless\\" was forced to finish his career on a 10th rate team in Carolina, an interesting echo of Costner's other baseball movie, \\"Bull Durham.\\"  In addition, \\"Shoeless\\" Joe's best speech, about that Carolina team's travel and hotel arrangements, echoes one of Costner's most-quoted \\"Bull Durham\\" speeches.  Finally, Madigan's character is named \\"Annie,\\" as is Susan Sarandon's in \\"Bull Durham.\\"  Supposedly, ballplayers call their groupies \\"Annies.\\"<br /><br />In sum, yeah, the movie's probably a guy thing.

B0001611DI|5.0|I first saw this movie in May 9th 1992 when I was 13.  I found it at the public library during our small-town's annual carnival.  I had either heard of it somewhere or remembered the plotline from my video review guide (which was my own personal \\"Bible\\").  When I saw it on the shelf, my jaw dropped. Obviously, this was going to be a cathartic moment in my life. Unfortunately, I had to wait until the next day (Sat).  I remember barely being able to sleep, full of the anticipation that only happens when you are 13.      I popped the dusty VHS in the VCR.  The picture quality was less-than-perfect which hardly mattered.  For the next 2 hours, I was transfixed. Sure, the gore was more extreme than I had ever seen before and would end up giving me nightmares for about the next 6 months.  But it was worth it: I watched it 4 more times before I had to bring it back.     I won't go into a plot outline or anything like that as there are people on amazon.com as well as [...] who can probably get to the point much quicker and easier than I.     However, I will expound on what I have always enjoyed about this film:    1. The quasi-documentary feel which is much amplified by the lack of over-acting by the cast.    2. The soundtrack which is easily one of the most scary and eerie soundtracks in film.  It is also one of the most memorable.    3. The over-the-top gore emphasizing the violence used by the living to thwart the advance of the dead. Yeah, it is nowhere near realistic but does show the comic-book appeal of the movie.    4.  The humanity of the characters (both living and dead) adds to the pesudo-realism and makes you care about the characters.    5.  And of course, the zombies.  It's hard to find a good zombie movie (and hard to find one that hasn't ripped this classic off shamelessly.

1582701709|2.0|Albeit the secret is good enough to know all the 200 pages are harping you the same, change your mind to good thoughts. This is very good but the book keeps telling you the same once and again and that makes the book boring. You'll read this book in one afternoon, but is not what I was expecting of it. Maybe this reading will be good for you but is not easy to do what in the book is written.
0743270754|5.0|Kudos to Doris Kearns Goodwin - this is an extensive book that really puts you inside the innner workings of Lincoln's cabinet.  Did the 'team of rivals' really work to help Lincoln?  Perhaps - but it seems more likely Lincoln kept the Republican party together by his appointments and then relied heavily on certain advisors and not others.<br /><br />I am sure this is nothing new and will not change as time goes by.  Lincoln was a political genius.  This book only cements that legacy.  The book is quite a read - I give it a high rating and my full endorsement.<br /><br />JVD

B000063DIH|3.0|I somewhat have a softspot for this album, just cause it was my first (yeah yeah i started being a maiden fan way late in the game) and i actually found out about them on accident. needless to say when i first heard the album I liked it a lot, so there you have it i bought all the other maiden albums. with that being said, after hearing all the other albums and years later of listening to maiden and following their stuff i have to say that this is probably my least favorite album. Not that its bad, its still better than 90 percent of whats out there today, but compaired to their earlier works, this one just dont hold up. fear of the dark, is an outstanding song, as the albums epic, catches my attention and rocks hard. be quick or be dead is another solid rocker. other than that though i feel that the album is pretty much filler. no garbage in this album, just nothing that really grabs me. <br />some people will say that this is an improvement over no prayer for the dying. I might agree just cause of the prescense of the title track Fotd but other than that its pretty much equals.
0061148512|4.0|I picked up this book purely out of curiosity. I wanted to see how someone with mental illness was able to construct such a well-known novel and in the end found that I was deeply impressed with the skill of Plath's writing. She is very talented in her use of words and I found the book engaging to read.   <br /> <br />I assume (because I have never ready any other book like this) that it's a rare thing for a book to capture a glimpse into the thoughts of someone that is mentally ill.  I was expecting a fragmented and disjointed writing and was surprised that many of her experiences and thoughts were reminiscent of other women at a post-college age--perhaps, to an extent, even my own.  Thoughts of inadequacy, self-doubt, and direction-less-ness often plague young adults and Ester showed all of the symptoms that coincide with \\"growing up.\\"  Of course her problems run much deeper.  Caused by something that I cannot figure out and that society is still looking for answers on.    Plath's real life story is a tragic one and you can only hope that books like this can help society find the answer to lifting the bell jar.   <br /> <br />All in all I liked this book.  I found there is a theme to the books that I enjoy most--female heroine and time period setting.  Like Francie Nolan growing up during the depression (A Tree Grows in Brooklyn), Cal Stephhanides with the riots of Detroit (Middlesex), I very much enjoyed reading about the experiences and thoughts of Ester Greenwood in mid-1950s New England.   <br /> <br />The forward of this book mentioned that 80% of female poets suffer from mental illness.  I was astounded by this number.  In today's society you don't really hear about sanatoriums, asylums and the shock therapy that was depicted in the book set in the 1950s--today you hear about anti-depressant medications and sessions with psychiatrists.  It was interesting to read about how mental illness was treated.   <br />
1556850255|3.0|This review is for the Recorded Books Classics Library on CD.<br /><br />Austen is Austen, so the quality of her writing and character observation will ultimately elevate any spoken performance of her text. Of the dozen or so books I've listened to in the Recorded Books Classic Library series, though, this is the first where I really felt the reader let me down.<br /><br />Flo Gibson reads fast, notjustbriskbutfast. I understand the desire to keep things moving, especially in a text that has as many descriptive passages as narrative ones, but I also think Austen needs to be savored a bit to be optimally enjoyed. The cadence never quite gets to the point where the reader is talking so fast that you can't understand her, but it does get to the point where you really have to listen intently, which can be hard to do while driving (which is where most people I know listen to books on CD). I found myself rewinding or back skipping the CD several times to say, \\"What was that phrase?\\" Again, not enough to ruin it, but enough to make it a more frustrating experience than a pleasurable one.<br /><br />Acceptable for those familiar with the novel who want to revisit it, but if this is your first time through, do yourself a favor and curl up with the book first. You won't regret it.<br /><br />[For a good contrast or alternative, check out Barbara Caruso's reading of Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth in the same series; it is superb.]

B000063DI8|3.0|This is the turning point album in Maidens career I think. SSOASS was the last album with the classic line up, Adrian smith left before this one was made, and only had a hand in writing \\"Hooks In You\\". the album is absent of a killer epic, mother russia is the epic on this album and it is weak to say the least. and although the singles tailgunner, holy smoke, and BYDTTS are good, they dont meet the same standards set by Maiden of old. And although Bruce still has the strong voice we all know and love, he seems to be trying something new in sound and approach, which he will continue in FOTD album. I am not too fond of it.Im not trying to sound like one of those negative ninnies complaining about how they changed their sound or they arent like they used to be. This is a good album worthy of a purchase, its just nothing special. and contrary to some peoples reviews, this was not the end of maiden, cause they are still coming out with good albums. i feel brave new world and a matter of life and death are up there with the classic stuff. and you cant have every album be a classic. every band has gone through a slump. and as i said before maiden in a slump is better than half of whats out there on good days.
B000EWBKM6|2.0|The finale for this show is really bad. It totally unbalances what took many years for this show to keep balanced. We are really expected to believe that Will and Grace stopped being friends for a few years? Come on! Every episode of this show was about how their bond became stronger. And Jack and Karen ending up together? Oh, please! This finale keeps jumping around to different events in their lifetimes. And Vince and Will together? I can't stand Vince! This finale was a total bomb. I gave it 2 stars because of Karen's amazing singing voice near the end.
0143038419|5.0|In buying this travelogue, I bought with the intention of joining along the author's travels and 'virtually traveling.' I thought what a treat in in itself. She travels to Italy, India, and Indonesia.  <br /> <br />Italy's stories are just laugh out loud funny and so refreshing. The tales from India show a little more thoughtfulness as she is studying at a guru's hideaway. And Indonesia is now winding down a year of fierce self study.  <br /> <br />However throughout the entire book, the author has quite a delightful way of self reflecting thoughts and discussing some philosophical life questions in a light and playful manner that invites you to do the same. I found myself learning so much about myself and letting it plant little life questions in my head to ponder as I slept. Almost a subtle guide to philosophical and life questions we all should think about but never are triggered.  <br /> <br />Loved it for the lightness, laughter, and thought-provoking discussions she brings to light. I read it with tremendous wonder.
1594200823|3.0|I loved this book, as I have loved Michael Pollan's others. However, reading it was an annoying experience because it is riddled with many typographical and editing  errors of all types. It's as though nobody at the publishing company even read the draft before it was published, or  an earlier draft was mistakenly sent to the printer. I have never seen so many errors in a published book. Indeed if this were any other type of product it would qualify as \\"defective\\" and be recalled and replaced by the manufacturer. The publisher should issue a corrrected version of this book and offer a free replacement to everyone who bought it.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|megadeth is by far the best American heavy metal band out there. far superior than Metallica. its unfortunate that metallica got all the hype and hoopla surrounding them, because dave and co. are the superior musicians and songwriters. this is probably my favorite album by them, and if you are not familiar with megadeth i would wholeheartedly recommend this cd to be the first in your library. every song on this album is a masterpiece, and never gets old. I rock this cd almost as much as i rock Seventh son by Iron Maiden (my favorite band). i cant really comment on the remastered vocals, im not even sure which version i got, its been awhile since i bought this one. but with that being said, with or without altered lyrics and vocals, the music on this cd is totally worth your time. if you dont have this album, you need to get it ASAP.

B000002J1M|5.0|\\"Foxtrot\\" is another winner from the Gabriel led Genesis with it's mix of prog rock, social commentary, and tales of fantasy.  The major highlight of this album is a song that many consider to be one of the all time great progressive rock epics \\"Supper's Ready\\".  The 23 minute track basically covers the biblical book of Revelations as it's subject matter with the return of Christ after the apocalypse.  Pretty heady stuff, and in lesser hands this could have been a disaster, but Genesis ultimately produce what may be the ultimate prog rock piece of work.   The lyrics, music, and vocals all mesh perfectly on this one and the result is truly stunning.  The rest of the album is great as well.  It opens with one of the band's all time classics \\"Watcher Of The Skies\\".  This track was a concert opener for several tours featuring frontman Peter Gabriel in his \\"batwing\\" outfit prowling the stage.  After all these years the song remains a must listen.  \\"Time Table\\" follows with it's relatively simple music and lyrics about medieval times.  Two songs of biting social commentary follow with \\"Get `Em Out By Friday\\", and \\"Can-Utility And The Coastliners\\".  The remaining track \\"Horizon's\\" is a short acoustic guitar instrumental by Steve Hacket that serves as a transition into the epic \\"Suppers Ready\\".  The music on this disc is all top notch.   Collins, Hackett, Banks and Rutherford are all at the top of their game here with outstanding solos and ensemble playing.  Even Gabriel gets into the act with several nice flute interludes.  \\"Foxtrot\\" is a great album and still serves as an inspiration to a myriad of prog rock bands to this day.  \\"Suppers Ready\\" stands as one of progressive rock's finest moments and makes this album a must own for any fans of the genre.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|this is the second album put out by maiden with their six man line up, and i have to say its their weakest. brave new world and a matter of life and death are better IMO. this is a good album, but i feel like a lot of songs have strikingly familiar sounds to them. Im in the middle of Montsegur and ill be like that sounds like...put old maiden song title here...and so forth. i mean being the 13th album they put out i guess you can expect a band to recycle some riffs. and its been three years since their last album BNW so its not like they rushed it out or anything. i just dont think its as solid an effort as the previous album nor the upcoming MOLAD. I think face in the sand is my favorite track, and while Pashcendale is a good epic, its somewhat repetative, and drawnout. maybe it wouldnt sound so drawn out if they were a little more complex, but its pretty much the mercenary only 9 minutes long. the title track although doesnt really suffer from this as much, doesnt capture my interest as much as it should either. over all an average album.
B00006DEFA|4.0|Having watched the original cut a dozen times over, the extra footages in this director's cut are somewhat refreshing. Especially helpful was the footage where Constanze visits Salieri at night, since this sequence explains the animosity she displays towards Salieri at the end of the movie.

B000002J1O|5.0|After the epic masterpiece that was \\"Suppers Ready\\" on the \\"Foxtrot\\" album, Genesis had a significant challenge in trying to top it with their next release.  What they did was produce a follow-up album of shorter songs (although 2 clock in at over 10 minutes) released as the album \\"Selling England By The Pound\\".  Although somewhat different than it's predecessor, \\"Selling\\" was another top notch Genesis album with not a weak track on it.  When you hear people talk about Genesis 70's period they tend to think of fantasy imagery as the main source of the subject matter.  In truth Genesis spent a lot of their time pondering social and class issues in their home country of England.  On no album is this more apparent than on \\"Selling\\".  Many of the lyrics on this one are as biting and cynical as any of Europe's angry punk bands, yet Genesis pulls it off with such class and subtlety that it is often overlooked.  Genesis had their first hint of chart success with this album as the single \\"I Know What I Like\\" was a minor hit in England.  The song, along with \\"Firth Of Fith\\" has become concert staples to this day for both the band and guitarist Steve Hackett.  The rest of the album is chocked full of great material.  \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\", \\"Battle Of Epping Forest\\", and \\"Cinema Show\\" are all fantastic.  Some of Hackett and keys man Tony Bank's best and most famous solos are to be found on this disc.  Phil Collins foreshadows things to come with his lead vocal on the pop-ish \\"More Fool Me\\", and Hackett is showcased on the short instrumental \\"After The Ordeal\\".  This is a great Genesis album, although it seems to often be overshadowed a bit by the ones that came directly before and after it for some reason.  This is essential Genesis.
B000NA28HU|1.0|Believability is everything in science fiction. The magic has no consistent workings by consistent limits. For instance, a person cannot be killed in one scene by certain magic, but can be by the same magic in a later scene. The hero uses Elf language to invoke the help of the trees against an opponent, but facing another opponent in the same forest, is at a loss for what to do. Convenient to write, unbelievable to watch. Making the characters work within limits, makes it believable, but then the writer must work within those limits, the writer now cannot just do anything, and if a power is given in one scene, then it must be available always in later scenes. Technically proficient in special effects. The same convenience is in the dialogue, easy to write, empty to watch.
B00000DGSN|5.0|Last May, VH1 did a special on the history of heavy metal which was broadcast over four nights and while it was enjoyable it was also remarkable who they had elected to omit and who they included. Calling KISS's landmark lp 'Alive' metal's first live album was grossly inaccurate as Deep Purple, an genre innovator whose contributions to metal seem to be neglected by revisonists, actually released THE first heavy metal live record in December of 1972. 'Made in Japan' can not only lay claim to being one of the first warts and all live documents of super heavy music but it also one of the genre's finest early momunments and the shining jewel in the Purple catalogue. Though they were falling apart at the seams internally, the Mark II lineup was in its fabulous glory and totally unified on the stages of Osaka and Tokyo during August of '72.  The band was playing the greatest versions of their best songs which is always the mark of a great line record, historically relevant and outdoing what was recorded in the studio. The epic length of such cuts as \\"Child in Time\\", \\"Strange Kind of Woman\\", \\"The Mule\\", \\"Lazy\\" and closer \\"Space Truckin'\\" feature not one wasted note. Gillan proves his worth as emcee of the loudest and most exciting live band in the world and his performance is magnificent (\\"Child in Time\\" - scary good, \\"Strange\\"- virtoistic and funny at the same time). Blackmore is the master! (\\"Highway Star\\", \\"Strange\\" and of course \\"Child in Time\\" - just the best in the business at playing lead guitar). Lord, organist supreme and causing pain and pleasure during \\"Lazy\\" and \\"Space Truckin'\\". Paice shows he may have been John Bonham's biggest rival as he shreds during \\"The Mule\\". Glover's bass raises goosebumps as he enters \\"Smoke on the Water\\" - for many the definitive version of that song, though you could say the same for all seven cuts. Bonus CD is emmense with \\"Black Night\\", \\"Speed King\\" and \\"Lucille\\" contributing to the sonic celebration. Deep Purple may not be respected much today in the heavy metal annals but they are right up there with Zeppelin and Sabbath in my humble opinion. Neither one of those bands created a lasting live document during their peak years (though we waited 30 years for 'West Was One'!). Purple should be in the insanely stupid hall of fame for many reasons but maybe because of what happened on three nights in the Far East most of all.
1590581814|4.0|The name of the book is the name of the major character and it is his occupation.<br /><br />This is a short book (take it with you if your flight is not a real long one, I finished this book in a few hours), but it is excellent (gritty, grimy) crime fiction. If you are looking for noir in a modern book, look no further.
B000IOM0WY|5.0|First of all, the film is terrific for its plot, acting and beautiful scenes but when you see it in Blu Ray you feel as though you can reach out and touch it.  Crystal clarity and natural colors elevate the movie experience causing me to want to see it over and over again. Enjoy
B000002J1L|4.0|\\"Nursery Cryme\\" for me is the album that really started things off for Genesis.  Although this was not their first album, it was the album where the band really came into their own and forged the sound that would initiate them as one of the all time classic progressive rock bands.  It was also to feature what most people consider to be the ultimate lineup of the band with Peter Gabriel up front, Phil Collins on drums (and occasional lead vocal), Tony Banks on keys, Steve Hackett on guitar, and Mike Rutherford on bass.  \\"Nursery Cryme\\" is not as good as some of the albums that came after it, but it is still a solid piece of work and a must own for serious Genesis fans.  One of the band's all time classics \\"The Musical Box\\" opens things up with Gabriel playing the dirty old man role culminating in a bombastic \\"climax\\".  Other highlights include \\"The Return Of The Giant Hogweed\\" which was a fantasy tale with a serious subtle commentary on England's diminishing wetlands.  \\"Harold The Barrel\\" is a cool little song about a restaurant owner standing on the ledge of a building contemplating suicide.  \\"The Fountain Of Salmacis\\" is prime progressive rock clocking in at just under 8 minutes to close out the album.  This was Genesis first truly great album and would serve as a springboard for even better things to come.
B00008NRI8|4.0|I rate this highly because it was an excellent movie.  Your service was also excellent.  Thank you!  Mary Beth Harden
1582701709|1.0|Positive thinking? OK. Positive attitude. OK. <br /> <br />That's about it. The rest is just new age gibberish told by psychics and motivational gurus. It's almost as bad as \\"What the bleep do we know\\".
B00008O0WN|5.0|If you like star trek at all, this video is a must.  Being the last movie in the Next Genenation era, and a culmination of 20 years of Next Gen content, this movie will blow you away (especially the ending!!) <br /> <br />
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This was the most entertaining version of this classic story I've ever seen - I sat in my living room and clapped at the end!
B000LXHK2C|1.0|A beautifully shot movie plagued by a terrible script and bad acting. Russell Crowe shouldn't try the Hugh Grant shtick! The movie had all kinds of potential as a story but it falls back into Hollywood's story template mire. Hollywood won't take any chances, it has a few plot lines that it uses over and over. Hollywood believes that audiences are too stupid to think for themselves so they put out movies with few surprises, are totally predictable and feature characters that you have seen before. You know how this story is going to unfold within the first 15 minutes. The only reason to watch this movie was for the cinematography and Albert Finney's performance. He commands your attention, fills the screen with his acting. A superb performance. Many have said it is the new \\"French Kiss\\". Though the story lines are similar, the direction and character development in \\"French Kiss\\" was much better. Kevin Kline's acting and character development were excellent. If you want to see this genre done really well, watch the film \\"Mostly Martha\\" directed and written by Sandra Nettelbeck. No, it's not about Martha Stewart. \\"A Good Year\\" would have been a much better film in her hands.
B000A59PMO|4.0|Veronica Mars is not only a great show, it's a smart show.  Not many shows these days except maybe Heros or 24 can carry a story arc over an entire season.  Mars does this very well while adding shorter storylines to each episode.  As far as versus season 2, #1 is much better.
B00000ILBK|5.0|It's like one bit fat sweet Next Gen episode with a much bigger budget, you'll love it.  Just buy the video and see.
B000J103WK|5.0|I owned Eagles' Hell Freezes Over DTS DVD some years back and was amazed on how a live concert DVD could be that good, and now with this new HD DVD release, it definitely brings the experience to another level.  Like all other people commented here how awesome this HD DVD is, I was impress with the words Don said in the interview portion of this DVD, he said, (not the exact words), it's not just happened, Eagles practice a lot and make sure everything is perfect before bring it to audience and give audience the best possible performance, that statemetn tells it all! <br /> <br />Go get the HD DVD and enjoy it!!
B000IMUYJM|5.0|This is one of those gem that sliped under the waves in 1974 that is really very creepy and still holds up well today. <br />  A killer (we never know anything about him, but in the case of this film it works and serves to make the tension that much higher) has entered the attic of a soroity house around Christmas time and begins to taunt and kill the girls still left in the house. It's that simple and that great. Bob \\"Porky's\\" Clark take the plot and makes the most of it and although both films are different, just like \\"A Christmas Story\\", has made a classic that still works after all these years. Now don't get mad at that statement, I just mean that just as that movie has proved to be a classic of movie history so this movie should be thought of also. Put the kids to bed TURN THE LIGHTS ON AND UNPLUG THE PHONE and enjoy this one
B0000CABJ1|4.0|Excellent CD! Donnas voice is timeless. The second CD is all 12\\" dance mixes. I forgot how great the MacArthur Park Suite was. If They included the Hot Stuff/Bad girls Mix (Anthology) in the CD, It would have got 5 stars from me!.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|He sido lector fanatico de los cuentos de asimov, desde la saga de los robots, pasando por el imperio y terminando con la saga de las fundaciones, Isaac asimov desarrolló un mundo de ciencia ficción, que hace que las guerras de las galaxias parezca un cliché de un cuento de hadas espaciales. Este cd, inspirado no solo en el libro de yo robot, si no en los demas cuentos de asimov (por ejemplo Dont let it show relata el sentir del robot R. Daneel en fundacion y tierra). este disco, junto con el de Tales, son los que mas me gustan, debido a que son discos conceptuales basados en historias que me parecen espectaculares, y ademas, reflejan lo que sus autores escribieron. por eso cuando digo que este disco le hace justicia a los cuentos de asimov, me refiero al disparate filmatografico de holywood titulado con el mismo nombre. <br /> <br />Sin suda alguna, para mi, este es uno de los discos que mas me gusta de APP, (todas sus canciones). Estoy esprando que me llegue la nueva edicion que tiene nuevas canciones ineditas para seguir disfrutandode buena musica.
B0001EFTTM|1.0|I bought this for my SciFi class.  We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film.  It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach.  Everyone was so disappointed.  I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up.  The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff.  Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long.  Bela Lugosi is a much better bet.  For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|This is one of the strangest and disturbing movies I've seen in a while. Christian Bale loses so much weight in this movie that it's hard to look at him. Filled with some really cool nightmarish visuals, this well written story may not be for everyone, but if you like weird movies..... Give it a try! Another great performance by Bale!
B000NDIAWO|5.0|I'm a fan since Destiny's Child and will continue to be because this artist is a real whole artist. She's not only a great singer but a great dancer, great performer, great songwriter, great producer, great designer!. People are talking bad about this re-make but I think  she did a great job. First, as a Latina, I'm very proud of her recording in Spanish for the first time! She's a smart girl and now she will expand her territory to Latinoamérica. Second, people don't see that Beyonce wrote every single song and produced this record, and she's only 25 years old! I'm proud of you Beyonce! Great job! Must have it!
B000001FN3|5.0|Este disco tiene la particularidad, de que su concepto es basado en los cuentos de edgar allan poe. La introduccion narrada por orson welles es genial, (yo solo la sustituiria por Vincent price, ya que el actuo muchos de los cuentos de poe), luego vienen 3 de las canciones que mas me gustan de toda la discografias de APP, esta son The raven , tell tale heart y cast of amontillado, que dicho sea de paso, son, junto con el asesinato de la rue morge y el pozo y el pendulo, los cuentos de poe que mas me gustan. <br /> <br />Este fue el segundo disco que compre de APP, y sin duda alguna, junto con el de I robot, son mis preferidos.
0743454537|5.0|I am sorry, but the unpredictableness (is that a word?) of the ending of the story is what made this book the best. I bought this after so many great reviews by my peers, and found that I could not put it down till i finished it. The ending just made me want to read every other book she has written and will continue to write. The quality of writing and the eventful way she wrote this book kept me on my toes the whole time I was reading, always gasping at unexpected parts and watching relationships unfold. It was great how she also had side relationships that did not really have to do with the plot, but all came together in one way or another. I would recommend this book to anyone in the world, and I am looking forward to creating a vast collection with all of the books by this amazing author. GREAT JOB!!!
0743496728|4.0|I enjoyed Jodi's latest novel. She certainly has a knack for roping you into her books. I was certain there would be no empathy for the main character, but there I was tearing up for the daily torment he had to endure. I found myself reading late into the night to find out how this one would play out. If you have never read a Jodi Picoult novel you will enjoy this a lot. If you are a fan you will fall right under her spell and not be able to put down until the verdict is in......
B000LE1FAY|4.0|I have been a Go-Go's and Belinda Carlisle fan since the 80's and found this release to be more interesting than anything she ever did before.  Her interpretations of French standards, done in French even, are very interesting.  If you like French music, I strongly suggest getting this CD.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Moralmente me siento obligado a escribir en relacion a este DVD. Para mi, este es el mejor concierto que dió queen, algunos comentan que mejor son los de los años 70 (live killers, paris, Raimbow,etc) Yo creo que este concierto reune todo lo mejor, ademas, este es queen en su mejor epoca (dicho por ellos mismos en las entrevistas) Freddy Mercury dió lo mejor de si, tal vez por que sabia en aquel momento que posiblemente nunca mas lo iba a poder hacer. Este concierto lo tengo en VHS desde hace 15 años y siempre lamenté que no estuviera el set completo (en el cd si aparecen todas las canciones). Es muy grato ver el impromptu (demostrandole a los que dicen que freddy ya en los 80 no tenia voz)el tremendo registro vocal que tenia, siguiendo con el brighton rock solo de brian, (para mi el mas completo y el mejor de todos los tiempos) seguido de una de mis canciones preferidas Now im Here. El concierto fue planificado de tal manera que arrancara con mucha fuerza, pasando por canciones olvidadas como in the lap of the gods, llevandolo a un punto mas intimo en un recital umplugged, donde tocan canciones de rock & roll rindiendole tributo a sus origenes rockanroleros, para luego recobrar energias y terminar de manera contundente con el clásico we are the champions. Este concierto reune lo mejor de queen, es el legado que nos dejó la mejor banda de rock en directo. Es mas, si existiese una máquina del tiempo, yo no iria a woodstock, yo iria a Queen Live at Wembley!!! <br /> <br />Adicionalmente este dvd trae un segundo cd con un ensayo inedito nunca antes visto de queen unos dias antes del concierto. Tambien trae algunas tomas del concierto del dia anterior(yo no sabia que este dvd fue grabado el segundo dia de concierto, ya que el primero llovió) y un documental del concierto en si, si no me equivoco, extraido del documental Magic Years. <br /> <br />Si te gusta queen, este dvd no debe faltar en tu coleccion. Lo recomiendo ampliamente.
159562015X|5.0|As a career counselor I have found the work of Donald Clifton and The Gallup Organization to be a breath of fresh air. Many of my clients have been unnecessarily burdened by a focus on what they are not doing well, rather than on what they do well. This book, as the earlier edition, Now, Discover Your Strengths, reminds readers why this approach makes sense. It is a compact summary of the process complete with an updated Clifton Strengths Finder (2.0). The book flap promises, \\"While you can read this book in one setting, you'll use it as a reference for decades.\\" I think it keeps its promise.
159562015X|5.0|I've loved the Strengthsfinder already but this thing rocks.  The personalized insights and action items are extremely practical and helpful.  I've bought several copies already and am telling all my friends to upgrade theirs.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I have come to know Renee Olstead ever since she appeared on the popular CBS comedy \\"Still Standing\\", but it is her singing that gets to me. She is like no other teenage artist in that she is the only one to date that can interpret jazz statndards in a very breezy manner. Not is she talented, but she is very adorable. If she were a contestant on American Idol, I would vote for her in a second. In fact, she should be a superstar based on her singing alone.  If you go into jazz, I strongly suggest purchasing this CD.  It will win you over.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|Gracias  a este cd, fue que comencé a escuchar a alan parsons project, hace como 10 años estaba escuchando en la radio eye in the sky un sabado en la mañana mientras iba a trabajar en la construccion de una planta de exraccion de petroleo, me gusto mucho y me sorprendió cuando dijero que era alan parsons, ya que pensaba que alan parsons eran puras baladitas de amor tipo air supply. Resulta que me compre el disco, y da la casualidad de que tenia otra gran cancion que me gustaba de siempre, pero no sabia que era de alan parsons, la cual es old and wise, me siento tan satisfecho con la compra de este disco, que tengo casi toda la coleccion, me falta solo freudiana, time machine y gaudi que no se consiguen. Acabo de comprar la reedicion de este disco, que trae nuevas canciones ineditas. Alan Parsons es uno de los pocos artistas que he escuchado, los cuales me gustan todas las canciones de todos los discos, eso, es bastante complicado de lograr.
B000NDIAWY|2.0|This cd is particularly disheartening. What we have here is the most beautiful voice to come along in years, but why all the gloom and depression? What we don't need is another \\"angst\\" singer. There are tons of 'em out there. I can't help thinking that this girl is wasting her talent. Looking for some uplifting, catchy and fun songs? You won't find any here.
B000N4SHPS|3.0|This is an entertaining film that far exceeds #5 in the series but falls short of the glory days (for me particularly 2 and 3 in the series).   <br /> <br />Rocky owns a restaraunt called Adrienne's.  His wife is dead for several years now, and Rocky, while successful and doing well, relives his past by revisiting his life with Adrienne too much.  It's unclear to me what drives Rocky back in the ring.  Is it his dissatisfaction with his current life?  It didn't seem to be the computerized boxing match with current champion Mason Dixon.  Rocky hardly gave it an afterthought.   <br /> <br />Dixon's character was underdone.  It would've been better if he was equally disatisfied with his life as champion.  He returns to his old gym and trainer, but that aspect of the story was under-written.  I think Stallone was trying to compare old-time athletics to new generation.  It didn't quite work.   <br /> <br />I think there should've been more animosity between Dixon and Rocky, particularly on Dixon's side.  Too much time was spent on Little Marie and her family and not enough on Dixon/Rocky and what leads them to fight.  While Little Marie was valuable to the film, it needed a little more in the way of motivation for Rocky to fight given the layoff and health risk. <br /> <br />Tony Duke's character was underutilized as well.  The training session was among the worst of the series.  (But at least there was one unlike Rocky 5).  The fight was very good, and saves the movie.  Although Rocky lost a split decision, it was a close call.  But then afterward there was no opportunity for the champion to say, hey Rock, you're better than me afterall.  Or at least I respect you. <br /> <br />Entertaining film.  3 out of 5 stars.  Good for Rocky fans especially.  A dud for Rocky haters or those who haven't seen 1 - 5.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|I watched this moving about 11:00 at night, and I could barely keep my eyes open. The lead character started off dry and boring. Her personality started to come through towards the end, but it never quite moved me like  <br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"(the mini-series/ Knightly) It seemed like a forced romance. I never really saw the sparks. I think I'll read the book to capture Jane Austens true intent...because this could not have been it!!
B00007149X|5.0|The Ground Hog Day wasn't my favorite movie I've seen but is okay movie
B00005NVDF|4.0|Directed by Herbert Ross, \\"Play It Again, Sam\\" (1972) is Woody Allen's film from the beginning to the final credits. Allen wrote the screenplay based on his Broadway play and he starred as Allan, a neurotic movie buff who writes the film reviews (what else?). Allan not just loves movies; he lives in the movies' world and constantly takes advices on how to get the girls from the legendary hero of his all time favorite movie \\"Casablanca\\", Humphrey Bogart's Rick. I am not a fan of \\"Casablanca\\" at all but if my favorite Artist is so much in love with it, maybe I should give it another try.<br /><br />When Allan's wife Nancy leaves him, his best friend Dick (Tony Roberts) and his lovely wife Linda (Diane Keaton) try to fix him up with several eligible pretty young ladies. Very typically for Woody's characters, he is a total failure with them. The only woman he feels comfortable with, he shares the same insecurities and neuroses, the one whose Birthday he remembers and who he desperately wants is Linda, his best friend's wife. \\"Play It Again, Sam\\" is a remarkable movie for several reasons and one of them - it was the beginning of a wonderful working (and not only) relationship between Allen and Keaton that would result in the movies \\"Bananas\\" (1971), \\"Sleeper\\" (1973), \\"Love and Death\\" (1975), \\"Annie Hall\\" (1977), \\"Interiors\\" (1978), \\"Manhattan\\" (1979), \\"Radio Days\\" (1987), and \\"Manhattan Murder Mystery\\" (1993) and will bring them both well deserved fame and Oscars. Made 34 years ago, \\"Play It Again, Sam\\" holds up very well and I would call it my favorite earlier Woody's film and the best Woody's film that he has not directed.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This movie is fantastic!!! I saw it 5 times in the theater and it was great everytime. Daniel Craig is awesome. The action/fight scenes were incredible. This guy is built, and VERY easy on the eyes!!   <br />
B000MQC9H4|3.0|This is going to be intensely unpopular, but while The Holiday was charming in many places, there were issues with it that ruined the watching for me. <br /> <br />I agree with a previous reviewer in that I couldn't wait to get back to the characters in LA. There was very little in Surrey that made it very English, and the of the characters themselves, Winslet and Black (who got hardly any air time) were by far the more sympathetic. Winslet's character also had the most baggage to work through, but it was done rather slap-dash so that we could see the innumerable make-out scenes between Diaz and Law. <br /> <br />Of the several badly-contrived first meetings, the worst was between Diaz and Law. For a brother and sister as supposedly close as Winslet and Law were, why didn't she tell him she'd left for the US? I don't care how screwed up she was in the head -- I don't know of a single sister who would let her brother go through the potentially embarassing moment of showing up at her home totally drunk while there was a stranger living in it. Especially if she cared so much about him not driving home while wasted. <br /> <br />Then there's the drinking. Despite the token moment when we learn that Law's character is allowed by his sister to stay over when drunk, almost every other drinking moment in this film (and there are a lot of them) is followed by driving(!), sex, or walking home blitzed, with no consequences whatsoever. Lovely message. <br /> <br />I won't say I didn't enjoy the movie at all -- Winslet's entire acting job was simply charming -- but when I begin thinking of ways I could have improved the screenplay as soon as the credits come up, it just isn't a five star rating.
1574535811|5.0|As the audio book is not even available yet, the previous reviewer was applying his comments to the book. I respectfully disagree with his assumption that the book has too much information. I wanted even more. <br />I personally have found the book the most important study I have ever read on nutrition and recommend it to each person wanting to take quality control of their health and life. I expect the audio book to be every bit as dynamic a presentation as is the book.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|As for this new boxset I loved it worth every penny I paid
B000N6U0DS|3.0|If you didn't read the book then, this is an excellent film, however, for those of us that read the book this movie is a big disappoinment. I know that a film based on a book has to be truncated to fit the average 2-3 hour movie time span but, the way that they told the story in this film is ridiculous. I won't give away the story but, the movie skipped a lot of important things in Mr. Gardeners life that explains where this man got his resiliency, determination, love, and will power. The movie also changed the story a bit too much, for instance, the way that the movie portrayed the split between Mr. Gardener and the mother of his child was way off the mark. I think that the movie should have \\"stuck to the book\\" and the director should have considered to at least introduce some of Mr. Gardeners experiences and influences throughout his young life (like director Spike Lee did with Malcolm X - which was an excellent book to movie film). Once again, Hollywood manages to destroy what could have been a monumental film. <br /> <br />As for the cast I think that Thadie Newton did an excellent job as the mother of Mr. Gardeners son. I'm not a big Will Smith fan (because I think his popularity exceeds his talent) but he did a good job of potraying the feeling and emotion in Mr. Gardeners life, not once during the film did I think , \\"hey thats Will Smith\\", So I have to give him credit. <br /> <br />Final words: If you didn't read the book and you want to see a film that is inspiring, then by all means get this movie, However, if you did read the book then you should not even waste your time.
B00005BKZJ|4.0|What starts off as an odd and disturbing story line, with severely dysfunctional relationships, turns into a delightful surprise. The way Bagdad Cafe unfolds, may throw a lot of viewers off the tracks, but eventually delivers a golden promise, with beautifully woven tapestries  and cameos of each bizarre character in the story. Jack Palance's role is one of his rare good-guy performances,  which displays such strong human affection and tenderness, that it may stand as one of the finest among many in his long career. Thoughtful and provocative, this movie requires an initial bit of patience, but will leave you feeling terrific about the way things finally evolve. A cult classic, a must-see!
0790729725|5.0|Brilliant movie! Brilliant the first time I watched it and brilliant now that I own it! One of the best gangster movies ever and one of my Top 10 movies of all time. I definitely recommend it. And how many of the actors in this movie went on to star in The Sopranos!
0714843377|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a co-worker on the fast track. He loved it, and so did I. It makes you think and at the end, it makes you want to start over and read it again. I already recommended it to a friend who bought it for two other friends. For the money, it's a worthy investment!
B00004REF1|5.0|Sinister. A combination of opulence and maliciousness. Exploitation. Decadence of the idle rich. The true Intentions are seduction, conquest and abandonment!  The result was even more than was bargained for! Yep, you found it...it's all here. I agree with the first reviewer and in addition, this is high art, spectacular scenery, photography and performances!  See it if you dare.
B0002KPIKA|4.0|The singing here is first class and V&eacute;ronique Gens in a dream! (She is perfect in every field - singing, acting, moving, looks ....)<br /><br />The orchestra under the direction of maestro Malgoire is very good. The countertenors and sopranists are very good (to listen to). The wigs don't work well. The makeup isn't good. The sets are not terribly interesting. The staging is very ordinary and, indeed, amateurish.<br /><br />However, the singing from almost all the cast is outstanding, especially from the various countertenors.<br /><br />Monsieur Jaroussky is a phenomenon, even if he stands of the stage looking like he doesn't know what to do much of the time! What a voice!<br /><br />V&eacute;ronique Gens saves this DVD with her voice, her beauty, her wit, her intelligence, her tolerance (apparently!), her abilities and her skills.<br /><br />A great work and a very good set of singers who could have done with some better stage directions and more drama classes! But I enjoy this recording anyway - it is great to have on whilst I am doing the housework and ironing!
B000001FI7|5.0|Amazing. Beth Gibbons voice has a wide range on this CD. Dummy is powerful and yet then has a sound that is soothingly hypnotic. This is a CD that I would recommend for anyone to purchase. I enjoy all of their albums though this has become an all-time favorite.
B000M5AJQS|2.0|What's good about the movie: the acting (except for poor old Leo who is playing poor old Leo, AGAIN!) and Boston scenery <br />What's bad about the movie: pretty much everything else, especially the plot but also the characters,  <br />Why did it win? Was it because they wanted to give it to Scorsese?
0440237688|5.0|Read it as a big kid - loved it.<br /><br />Read it as a not-exactly kid - loved it.<br /><br />Arguments that \\"The Giver\\" is not a suitable book for kids come from adults. I'll put it simply. When my fifth grade teacher told the class we were going to be reading this book, I was happy. I'd already read the book. Every week, once a week on Fridays, the entire class gathered round and we listened to our teacher reading \\"The Giver\\" out loud. We analyzed it in class, and every single one of us (including those who hated books and reading) loved it.<br /><br />Some people say that \\"The Giver\\" is inappropriate for children because it deals with death and other difficult social issues. This is the reason adults don't like it? If that's the case, they need a reality check. We'd already studied about the Civil War in school (mentioned in the book). We knew what the word \\"starvation\\" means. We understood the concept of \\"death\\". Maybe we didn't fully understand population control, but we knew it existed. Unnecessary sheltering is silly. This book drew us in with the first sentence. It opened our minds to things we knew OF, but didn't fully understand. It brought to light things that nobody ever wanted to mention because they were concerned we were too young. This is exactly what made the book wonderful.<br /><br />It's not just the world image that's interesting. I fell in love with Jonas the moment the book started. He's an easy character to relate to, no matter what sort of a person you are. I connected to his need for accuracy. Others connected to his friendships and personality. All of the characters felt real at the beginning, but only halfway through do we realize how fake everything is. It was wonderful to reread the book and note all of the little things that had been hinted at, that only later became clear and necessary.<br /><br />This book is not just about a future void of differences. It's about relations between people, it's about being different, and it's about a boy who's trying to do his job, stay normal, but is realizing that he can't. The Giver himself is also a fascinating character that we very quickly learn to love like a grandfather. We see him at his best, and at his worst. We see humanity in an ignorant way.<br /><br />And yes, it's a children's book. Adults may find that the writing style is too simple for them. It's perfect for pre-teens. It's got enough of a plot to keep them interested, and isn't too difficult to read. It's a wonderful book that I don't think I'll ever stop loving.<br /><br />I recommend this book whole-heartedly.

1582701709|4.0|I heard about the book from a co-worker.  My co-worker and I share our experiences using the techniques each and every day we work together.  She supports my visual pictures and my picture wall. I support her and give her the same positive feedback that I receive.  We are much happier and calmer individuals.  We have both received comments that we look different, in a good way, and that we both appear to have lost weight and look younger. We both smile. Our lives have been changed for the better.  We are the ones that have made the change due to knowing the true secret to a better life. <br /> <br />This book has helped me to realize the negative effect of the 'programming' that has occurred throughout my life has contributed to who I am today, how I react to various situations that have occurred in my life and what I can do to turn the tables around and live the rest of my life as a truly happy, strong spiritually and emotionally; and financially better person. <br /> <br />The key is to take what you need from the book and apply it every single moment of your life.
1582701709|1.0|I find it very sad everytime I see hordes of troubled people find a new massively hyped panacea to fix their lackluster lives; \\"Oh goody!\\" they say, \\"a magic thing to make all the bad go away!\\"    Two months later where are they? Do they still have issues with relationships, finances and health? Yes! Do they still look with optimism towards the future? No! It is time people learn that a) self discipline is the biggest factor in improving your life, and b) really rotten things can happen anyway. You are going to have to deal with it.     Gratitude and a positive outlook are wonderful things, but this is hardly a \\"secret.\\" Obsessing over your goals and \\"positive thinking\\" about them all the time is hardly the way to a full and worthwhile life--at least by any measurement I am comfortable with.
B00003CWTI|5.0|It's one of those movies that I will watch over and over again and see something new each time.

B000LAZDQA|1.0|This film is the first film I've seen in a theater that is about sex that actually shows sex. This sex is real too. This movie is so sexual it makes Sex and the City look like Sesame Street. The film is about a handful of characters, all with their own stories and problems, search for, well, sex. This film covers all bases. There is straight sex, gay sex between two men and two women, and men and women pleasuring themselves. There is even a scene with group sex. And it's all real. It shows about as much as any porn would show. The stories are not fantastic, some characters are not developed enough outside the bedroom, and some senarios are silly or unrealistic. The acting was about as good as the acting in a real porn, and the script they were working with was packed solid with cliches. If you want a film with wonderful acting and a compelling story, go somewhere else, and even if you want to see the film for the sex, go get a porn. It is not satisfying in either aspect.
B000LC55F2|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen.  Even if you guess some of the surprises during the film, keep watching.  You won't guess everything.  I thought I had it figured out, but continued to be very surprised, all the way up until the shocking ending!  Then I immediately wanted to see it again.  I'm not a huge fan of Christian Bale offscreen, but I have to give it to him;  he does whatever it takes to bring his characters to life.  He is a great actor and really goes the extra mile for his audience.  The entire cast does a wonderful job with this one.  No complaints.  And that's not something I say about a movie very often.

B000N6TX1I|1.0|I have been looking forward to this movie since I saw the first trailer, and I feel like I just wasted 2 hrs of my life.  I love Clive Owen and Michael Caine, but I just kept saying to myself, \\"Why would these actors choose to do this movie?!\\"   <br /> <br />It seems to me like it just picks up in the middle of the world falling apart (flimsy reasons for that) and you follow  Clive's character around during some serious misadventures, then, it's over.  What just happened?  The script leaves me scratching my head.  (no, I don't have lice). <br /> <br />Clive is another regular guy turned hero by accident.  He is great, and Michael Caine is wonderful, but it just did not matter.  It is not sci-fi.  (so Clive says during bonus feature)  By the way, don't waste your time on the bonus features, they did not help me figure out what this movie was about.  I just don't get it.  And now I see all these rave reviews by critics and regular joes.  I absolutely cannot understand what is so great about this movie.  To me it was BAD.  (Sorry Clive & Mr. Caine). <br /> <br />

As he heads out to find it, he comes in contact with a king, a merchant, a camel rider and an Alchemist, all of whom help him to reach his goal.  <br />One of the greatest lessons repeated throughout the story (although there are many) is that when a person really is on the journey to find his destiny, the whole universe opens up to help them. The universe including birds, deserts, mountians, rain and people. In order to notice them you must look for the omens/signs, which are everywhere.  <br />Though out the story, he is tried and tested because the universe wants only those that are worthy.  <br />On his journey he discovers truths about people, nature and learns the unspoken language that is taught to those that see it. <br />There is a Santiago in all of us.
B000005H3M|5.0|This album came out a year after I'd caught Rich with Sinatra, a period when, above all, the great drummer wasn't afraid to swing!  Beginning in 1968 Rich, like so many other jazz musicians, practically became paranoid of the walking-bass 4/4 swing pattern that had served everyone from Basie to Charlie Parker to Bill Evans so well.  A pulse as fundamental to life as a heart beating  or a lung breathing was no longer sufficiently \\"emphatic\\" to be heard, or understood, by the '60s generation.  Rich tried to \\"connect\\"  with the Beatles-Stones audience by going to a quasi-rock repertory along with the addition  of electric bass.  Fortunately, this phase lasted for only several years, and by 1974 Rich was once again validating the swing tradition of Basie, Goodman, Dorsey and his own roots.<br /><br />\\"Big Swing Face\\" captures the band at an optimal period, especially for listeners who don't require for every tune the double-eighth-note, on-the-beat, slam-bam feel of much rock-pop music.  And a previous reviewer's point about Rich's later incorporation of electric bass is well taken.  A recently released DVD video of the Rich band from the late '70s features an all-swing program but retains electric bass (even Dizzy Gillespie made exclusive use of the instrument for a while).  The instrument, quite frankly, sounds loud but penetrating and out of balance with the rest of the band.  The band may swing as much, but from a listener's perspective the sound is less buoyant, less integral with the overall sonic textures of the ensemble.<br /><br />Fortunately, by the end of the '70s, the great bass debate was fait accompli: the acoustic instrument had proven its inherent worth and staying power--at least in the jazz idiom.  It's refreshing, though, to hear a recording made before all the fuss interfered with simply enjoying the music.  \\"Big Swing Face\\" is such a recording, boasting, moreover, a total of eighteen tunes (admittedly, a couple of them \\"period pieces,\\" though Buddy's 12-year-old daughter's singing makes it easy to forgive one such instance), making it a great value and assured winner for any fan of Rich or just plain swinging, great big band jazz.<br /><br />Finally, for an \\"on location\\" recording the audio is first rate--better, in fact, than many studio dates with the bonus of the electricity that only a responsive audience can bring.ddy's 12-year-old daughter's singing makes it easy to forgive one such instance), making it a great value and assured winner for any fan of Rich or just plain swinging, great big band jazz. <br /> <br />Finally, for an \\"on location\\" recording the audio is first rate--better, in fact, than many studio dates with the bonus of the electricity that only a responsive audience can bring.

1400031362|5.0|This series of books has been a favorite of mine since they were first published, long may they continue.<br /><br />In this the third in the series of books about the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency we are drawn into several little mysteries, some more serious than others, like the important man who thinks his brother's wife is poisoning his family, the man who wants to make sure that all the girls in a beauty pageant he is holding have good morals and are not \\"bad girls\\".<br /><br />Also there is the worrying mystery about Mr Matekoni's strange illness, is  he sickening for something or does he have a strange illness called depression and if he does have depression, how can it be treated?  And who is the strange little boy in the Orphan camp who can't speak, only growls and why do people think there are lions about when lions are only found in the Kalahari?<br /><br />Add to this a smart secretary from the Botswana Secretarial school with a passion for shoes who got 97% in her exams, along with a plethora of delightful and understated characters, including the enigmatic and shrewd Mma Precious Ramotswe who knows what makes the human mind tick, and you have yet another wonderful book from the Master author Alexander McCall Smith.

B00067189O|1.0|This is a dual disc with a nearly standard resolution mix (16bit@48KHz) deliberately published by Sony (the creator with Philips of the SACD!) to infringe the Dual Disc reputation. Dual Disc itself is not good or bad: can have up to 24bit@192KHz in stereo mode and 24bit@96KHz in multichannel mode. The system is garbage in-garbage out: if you put garbage *in* (16 bit resolution) you get garbage *out* (16 bit resolution).<br />If you wish to enjoy Dual Disc / DVD-A go elsewhere: PCM is superior to DSD (but you'll hardly listen the difference if the recording is well done, though).<br />Miles Davis music is outstanding, of course - this is out of question!

B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Mystic River is a triumph for Clint Eastwood. Truly a moving film, Mystic River never lets your eyes wander from the screen as you're completely focused on this very disturbing story. A film capturing the adult lives of once childhood friends, played by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon, you watch as they come together once again after what appears to be many years of brief and intermittent run-ins with each other.<br /><br />Sean Penn plays somewhat of a wise, yet immature loose cannon of a man, Kevin Bacon as a MPD (Massachusetts) detective and Tim Robbins as the man whose life was forever altered because of a shocking childhood trauma, these three play off of each other very well. I wanted to reach out to each of them. There are moments where some may see Kevin Bacon's character as a bit flushed out, but it appears that this is more effective than not. We jump from age 10 to probably late 30's, early 40's of these three men and we learn little about them that helps to explain so much.<br /><br />After Penn's daughter is brutally murdered, Bacon and Laurence Fishburne (a fine choice to partner with Bacon) take on the case to find her killer. The three friends are all shaken up (obviously Penn is destroyed over hiss loss) and the mystery seems to unfold quite rapidly. This is definitely one of the most intriguing mystery films I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />Fans of those earlier mentioned should really enjoy this film. There are also some excellent and shocking performances by Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden. I highly recommend this film. Its disturbing and almost heart-wrenching (perhaps even angering) subject will attract any looking for a solid dramatic mystery with some very memorable characters. This is one to add to your collection.
B000009EAD|5.0|To most metal critics and some fans as well, memorable, simply undiluted metal was pretty sparse during the mid-late 90's. I mean, in my opinion also, bands didn't exactly put out their most classic albums during that timespan. Just to list a few examples: Maiden put out their Blaze Bailey albums \\"X-Factor\\" and \\"Virtual XI\\" which I liked a lot, but most people bashed the crap out of 'em. Priest was basically dormant during this time, only releasing \\"Jugulator\\" and \\"98 Live Meltdown\\" both not up to par with Halford's classics by any means. Metallica experimented with their albums \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" (both of which scared away many fans), Megadeth released \\"Cryptic Writings\\" which was quite good, but then put out their lowest point \\"Risk\\", and bands like Dio, Black Sabbath, and Ozzy were either releasing their worst albums or not putting any out at all. However, there was this one band in the 90's (don't worry, I know other bands were delivering the goods in the 90's like Pantera, etc) that held the thrash-metal torch high and proudly, not wanting to let their influences down. That band is the one and only ICED EARTH!<br /><br />Just a devoted and humble group of guys who wanted metal to live forever, the crew of Iced Earth stood against the norm, beat all odds, and released some true, nose-to-the-grindstone classics during the 90's. \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", which came out in 1998 is a perfect representation of their talent and reputation. The riffing can be thrashy, in-your-face, and aggressive-as-hell at times (on tracks like \\"Disciples of the Lie\\", \\"Stand Alone\\", or \\"My Own Savior\\") but it can also be quite melodic and emotional (i.e. \\"Melancholy\\", \\"Watching Over Me\\", or \\"Blessed Are You\\"). Basically, if you like Schaffer's heavier side then this cd is for you. But also, if you like his more melodic pieces that have passion and depth, then get this classic! Matt Barlow couldn't be better on this album as well. His voice is so well-ranged and powerful, it's just insane. He sings in his best thrash voice on the heavier tracks, but also really reaches low when the slow number comes up, singing emotionally and very sad on some songs (which is a unique and welcome effect). The drums and bass are also very much involved, taking the rhythm section to great heights.<br /><br />As far as the songs go, SWTWC has great depth. There are almost an equal number of slow tracks as there are heavy ones, and for the first 10 songs they go in a pattern (heavy track, then a slow one). The heavy tracks are of course amazing, grabbing you by the balls and never letting go, but the power ballads grab you by the heart and act as a nice contrast to the heavy-hitters. Now I know that most fans are really dedicated to the thrashy, no-holds-barred style of earlier IE releases like \\"Burnt Offerings\\" or \\"Night of the Stormrider\\" but I really ask that you open up to their emotional side too. As for the tracks, \\"Burning Times\\" starts off the album and everyones knows that Schaffer never lets a sappy opener make an appearance. This heavy number isn't blinding fast, but it's a nice mid-tempo song with heavy riffage and soaring vocals from Barlow. The second number slows it down considerably, but is just as good. \\"Melancholy\\" is a very emotional song with some great guitar strumming and some of those \\"Sad\\" vocals from Matt. However, at the chorus, the heaviness is cranked up as the power chords rip through the speakers. Barlow then hit those high notes and really adds a lot to this hit. EVERY song is amazing, and while I don't have time to talk about all of them, I must mention the \\"Something Wicked\\" trilogy. What an amazing, all-out incredible way to end this masterpiece. All three songs (Prophesy, Birth of the Wicked, and The Coming Curse) are perfect thrash tracks, complete with fast-paced riffs, double-bass mania, and above-average vocals from Matt. They have their slow and emotional moments as well like the beginning two minutes of Prophesy, andthe opening, classical piano piece on The Coming Curse. Just great, undiluted metal!<br /><br />Get this plus every other Iced Earth classic. You won't regret it!and the opening, classical piano piece on The Coming Curse.

B000MZHW40|5.0|For a number of years filmmakers have tried to translate the troubles in the \\"developing nations\\" to lukewarm public reaction.  There was \\"Cry Freedom\\" and \\"A Dry White Season\\" that essentially treated the blacks as peripheral characters.  About the most honest was the gripping \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" with a superb Don Cheadle as a protagonist.  Director Edward Zwick here has managed what other filmmakers couldn't do.  He has fashioned a thrilling action film without compromising the polemics of the dire situation of some Africans.  It helps that this film sports a cast that includes the most dynamic actors of this generation, Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou, and Jennifer Connelly.  There is an urgency to this film where the makers demand that attention be paid to the people who have suffered for so long but it is done in a subtle way.  To paraphrase another film, everybody should bear witness to the inconvenient truth on display here.

Anyway, I was very curious to hear this album so I pre ordered it. I didn't know WHAT sound this album would have. But I was willing to take a chance on it.  <br /> <br />Let me begin by saying WOW. I CANNOT BELIEVE this album came from Jennifer Lopez. This is an album that I Loved from start to finish. ALTHOUGH I could have done without adios. I was shocked to hear such a smooth album. The lyrics were written to PEREFECTION and Marc's back up vocals were the icing on the cake as far as I was concerned.  <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Jennifer's other music, then you'd probably dislike this album. But if you love GREAT LYRICS, Smooth Vocals, and the wonderfully creative sound of Latin Music, this album is for you.  <br /> <br />I Applaud Jennifer Lopez for taking a risk and not trying to do what's \\"HOT\\" at the moment, but doing a smooth ballad filled album that has surely has quenched my thirst. As a fellow Puerto Rican, she has SURELY made me proud. Keep taking Chances Jennifer..  I am proud of you. Que Dios Te Bendiga. <br />

B000MV9026|1.0|I was particularly unimpressed by this movie when I watched it in the theatre with my five-year-old son.  He enjoyed it, but fortunately many of the issues that might frustrate adults went over his head. <br /> <br />First there was the sexual suggestiveness of the movie.  It was far too mature for young children. <br /> <br />Second, there was the plagaristic issue.  As many have noted, this is a ridiculous animated rip-off of March of the Penguins (which was interesting and educational unlike this). <br /> <br />Third, there was the overt racist stereotyping of many of the characters.  I don't belong to any of the ethnic groups affected, but I found the over-the-top charicatures to be mildly offensive. <br /> <br />Fourth, It was excessively preachy.  I am used to Hollywood pretentiousness in their socio-political values, but I am getting tired of them using cartoons to brainwash my children with the whole 'humans bad' agenda. <br /> <br />It staggers me to recall that this waste of film won an oscar over cars.  It just goes to prove that the Academy follows their own agenda, and that the entertainment value of a movie is irrelevant.

B000N3T0DW|4.0|Writer and director Pedro Almodovar has been looking to his childhood for inspiration lately. \\"Bad Education\\" (2004) was a dark, labyrinthine film noir inspired by the experiences of childhood friends. Now \\"Volver\\" returns to Almodovar's roots in La Mancha for a more optimistic look at mother-daughter  relationships. Two sisters living in Madrid, Raimunda and Sole, ritually return to their hometown in La Mancha, Raimunda's teenaged daughter Paula (Yohana Cobo) in tow, to clean the grave of their deceased mother. When their elderly Aunt Paula dies, Raimunda (Penelope Cruz) begs off making the trip to La Mancha for the funeral due to an emergency at home. Sole (Lola Duenas) goes but comes back with a stowaway: The ghost of her deceased mother (Carmen Maura), who wants to talk to Raimunda from whom she was estranged. Raimunda is having troubles of her own, having just lost her husband and opened a neighborhood restaurant without its owner's knowledge.<br /><br />Pedro Almodovar has a great talent for making improbable situations seem completely natural. \\"Volver\\" shifts between comedy, melodrama, and poignancy and unravels a couple of family mysteries as well. The triumphs and tragedies of these three generations of women are, above all, a tribute to mothers who give their energy, their protection, and even sacrifice their self-respect out of love for their children. \\"Volver\\" isn't as visually lush as Almodovar's films often are. The focus is fully on the characters, who are vibrant and captivating as always. Penelope Cruz' makeup is overdone to reflect Raimunda's spirited personality, so the actress doesn't look as good as she could. But this performance will leave no one wondering why Cruz is a major movie star in Spain. Blanca Portillo as family friend Agustina is such an essential and perfectly articulated supporting role that it can't be overlooked. \\"Volver\\" has that Almodovar verve that no other filmmaker can produce. In Spanish with optional English subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony Pictures 2007): There are 5 featurettes, a Poster Gallery (20 posters), a Photo Gallery of 71 production and behind-the-scenes stills, and an audio commentary by director Pedro Almodovar and actress Penelope Cruz. \\"Making of Volver\\" (8 min) is behind-the-scenes footage edited together and put to music. In \\"Interview with Pedro Almodovar\\" (10 min)(English & Spanish w/ subtitles), the director talks about La Mancha as an inspiration, \\"Volver\\" compared to \\"Bad Education\\", and the rural view of death as assimilated into life. In \\"Interview with Penelope Cruz\\" (5 min), Cruz discusses the film's themes, in English. \\"Interview with Carmen Maura\\" (8 min) (English & Spanish w/ subtitles),  discusses her character, the mother, and working with Almodovar again after 17 years. \\"Tribute to Penelope Cruz\\" (18 min) is an interview with Cruz from AFI Fest 2006, where she was honored.

B000NDIAWY|5.0|\\"The Story\\" is by far the best collection of songs by Brandi Carlile I've heard.  From the first track \\"Late Morning Lullabye\\" which opens with the line \\"As soon as my eyes shut the slide show begins...\\" continuing on with the title track \\"The Story,\\" and concluding with the hidden track \\"Hiding My Heart\\" which begins with the line \\"This is how the story went...\\" The entire albumn is beautifully presented.  Brandi's vocals start out strong and sweet and erupt into an explosion of gritty passion.  The upbeat \\"Have You Ever\\" reminds me of my days as a camp counselor, and the melodious harmonies in \\"Cannonball\\" are soulful and numbing.  Her self-titled Debut was good - but this one is fantastic!

He was able to speak from presence itself and in a way that was literary and poetic.

I could not read one more page of the main character's self-indulgent and arrogant thoughts and actions.  I guess, if you are the type of person that needs to love the main character in order to read a novel, then this is not your book.  I couldn't stand him and I really hope that the main character isn't a reflection Paul Coelho.  I almost threw this book away, but I instead donated it.  I loved \\"The Alchemist.\\"

In fact, I think this is my favorite album ever by my favorite band ever and it includes my favorite song ever, This Must Be the Place.
1594200823|4.0|It is hardly surprising that most Americans have very little idea of where their food originates and all of the processes involved. Isn't that the nature of modern society where vast enterprises have transformed the particulars of our lives? Who knows how their computer or the Internet works, how their house is built, or how their car works. In addition, the real impacts and costs on our society and environment in producing the modern structure of life are scarcely known, if not well-concealed.<br /><br />But food is different - we all know what food is - don't we? A Chicken Nugget is just chicken - right? We may not all be farmers and chefs, but surely growing and preparing food can't be too complicated. The author explodes those simplistic and comforting thoughts. It turns out that the production of food has not escaped the demands of capitalism including the marketing and selling of half-truths. In the first part of the book, the author shows how corn, the production of which is heavily subsidized by the government at the behest of huge agri-business firms, is, in many different forms, the foremost component in most processed foods, with Nuggets being no exception. In addition, corn is the primary feed of cattle and chickens enclosed in truly repulsive feeding enclosures, located in remote rural areas. The increased use of oil in fertilizers, pesticides, and transportation and the heavy use of antibiotics to counter diseases caused by such unnatural production have immense costs to our environment and to us. Americans know virtually none of this.<br /><br />In the second part of the book, the author contrasts the industrial production of corn, beef, and chicken sustainable only by costly artificial inputs with the self-sustainability of modest-sized farms where grasses, crop production, and animal feeding can form a symbiotic closed loop system. Such farming requires much attention with constant rotation of crops and animals. However, not only do adverse environmental effects not appear, but the exchange of nutrients between plants and animals is far more complex than the \\"monocultural\\" production of corn to our ultimate benefit. In the last of the book, the author shifts away from the present to gain some sense of what man in the wild experienced in hunting game and harvesting naturally growing plants - probably unnecessarily.<br /><br />While the book is not exactly unfocused, the author really does not seem intent on driving home a resounding point. He begins with noting the falsity of the supposed vast selection that we have in the local supermarket. In fact, the choices are mostly marketing hype, as an examination of products' makeup demonstrates more uniformity than not. Our ignorance of food, of our inability to make informed choices, is readily seen in our susceptibility to fad diets, such as a low-carbohydrate diet, etc.<br /><br />The section of the book describing the dominance of corn in our food supply is by far the most compelling. The biological breakdown of corn is interesting. The role of corn starches and sugars in obesity can scarcely be denied. The book wanders after that point with excessive adulation directed towards sustainable farming, agonizing over the meaning of organic, a long debate on the ethics of killing animals for consumption, and long-winded descriptions of dinners prepared with ingredients from industry, the farm, and the forest. His equating the dilemma of sifting through corporate obfuscation in the grocery store with the life-and-death choices of man in nature is not compelling.<br /><br />He does not try to make the case that small, sustainable farming is the answer to our food supply and environmental preservation. Yet he suggests little in the way of controlling our dominant industrial food production paradigm, despite its deleterious consequences. He seems to be putting out mostly a \\"Now you know\\" message concerning food past and present. A far bigger alarm needs to be raised. Theprofitability of a few mega-corporations should not be allowed to dictate the production of foodstuffs in a way that is creating problems for our long-term health, if not survival.ons should not be allowed to dictate the production of foodstuffs in a way that is creating problems for our long-term health, if not survival.

B000089RVX|5.0|Amy Lee is an inspiration to female vocalists (like myself) everywhere. In all of Evanescence's songs, especially 'My Immortal' and 'Hello', her voice, coupled with the music, is heart-wrenching. I love this Cd, and this band.<br /><br />1.Going Under - 10/10 - The opening to the song is enough to get your interest. But the rest of it is so great, that you can't help but love it. BTW, this song's written about crazed fans (like, maniacs). Who knew?<br /><br />2.Bring Me to Life - 10/10 - This was my introduction to Evanescence. It's a great song, and the male/female balance in the chorus makes it stand out somewhat from the rest of the album. That's a good thing.<br /><br />3.Everybody's Fool - 8.5/10 - I don't know.  This song just never really grew on me that much. I guess it's okay, though.<br /><br />4.My Immortal - 9.5/10 - I just love this song. One of their more mellow ballads, but the topic is something many people can relate to, including me.<br /><br />5.Haunted - 9/10 - This song's kinda creepy. Like, a stalker's song. But I still like it. ^_^<br /><br />6.Tourniquet - 9/10 - Written by Rocky when he was in a Christian band. I like the 'my wounds cry for the grave' part.<br /><br />7.Imaginary - 9.5/10 - One of my personal favorites. It's a very pretty song.<br /><br />8.Taking Over Me - 9/10 - Again, kind of a stalker song. 'I'll give up everything just to find you/I have to be with you/to live/to breathe' It's...a little odd, but like all the others on this album, I love it.<br /><br />9.Hello - 7/10 - Oh, man. This song is just soo depressing. It's about Amy's little sister that died when she was three. This song makes you wanna cry.<br /><br />10.My Last Breath - 9/10 - ...Sort of a nothing-special song by these guys. It's just as good as all the others, but...I don't know.  It's lacking originality.<br /><br />11.Whisper - 10/10 - I LOVE this song. It's so awesome, the part near the end of the song, '...Forsaking all I've fallen for/I rise to meet the end' It's a little depressing, but definitely one of the most beautiful songs on Fallen.for/I rise to meet the end' It's a little depressing, but definitely one of the most beautiful songs on Fallen.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I love this show, and it is great to be able to see each episode back to back.  This set is beautifully packaged and looks great just sitting out.  I have not yet read the book included with this set (I have not watched seasons 4 & 5 yet and do not want to spoil it by reading the book first), but I am pleased that it is a part of it.
B000002U8G|5.0|For Floyd fans who are also prog heads it doesn't get better than Meddle. \\"Echoes\\" is worth the price of admission alone and is often overlooked in the \\"prog epic masterpiece\\" stakes next to pieces like \\"Supper's Ready\\" or \\"Close to the Edge\\" (It pre-dates both). The band's more pastoral side shines brilliantly in \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" and \\"Fearless\\" while \\"One of These Days\\" must be one of rock's greatest album openers -- a scorching tour de force instrumental that shows off David Gilmour's slide guitar mastery. The sort of blending of pop, prog and space rock that was hinted at on Atom Heart Mother is far better demonstrated here and Gilmour and co. have been playing out this formula ever since.

B000KRNCYY|5.0|I'm rather fond of the ladies.  To moi, there is nothing more appealing, alluring, soothing, gratifying, satisfying, hypnotic or sensuous than a woman's voice in song--a voice as distinct, gentle, and clear as a bell on a brisk winter morning.  The Celtic Women lasses aptly fit my perception of lusty damsels seducing me in song, and their A NEW JOURNEY CD is hotter than Halle Berry in a see-through catsuit.<br /><br />This CD is a compilation of outstanding Old and New World music, augmented by an orchestra second to none.  Chloe, Orla, Lisa, Meav, and Hayley sing solo--or blend in delicate, outstanding harmony--a heady variety of songs:  from \\"Lascia Ch'io Pianga\\" to \\"Scarborough Fair.\\"  There's even an a cappella rendition of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" that has to be heard to be believed.  And then there's Mairead (you can't get more Irish than that, now can you?), the fiery, feisty blonde fiddler who can rosin up a plethora of good vibes with her dancing fingers.<br /><br />With their delicious voices and extraordinary talent, the Celtic Women put on one dazzling gig.  And their CD A NEW JOURNEY is seduction supreme--red hot musical Viagra.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, THE RECKONING
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I wasn't crazy about this version the first time I saw it, but I have grown to love it. I was accustomed to a certain stiffness in other film versions and a (rightful) fixation on the period's rigid social mores. So, the ambiance of pigs and mud and barking dogs threw me at first. When a co-worker asked me how I liked it after my first viewing, I complained, \\"Too rustic,\\" but had to admit that the lushness and the cinematography are gorgeous. That's what made me watch it again. And again.   <br /> <br />Some of the narrative choices are a little strange (why does Darcy make his first proclamation of love in a gazebo during a downpour??) and some of the casting doesn't work (Donald Sutherland is so wrong as Mr. Bennet). The actors who play Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins in the A&E version are impossible to outdo. And while a Colin Firth or a Laurence Olivier is probably more physically appropriate as Darcy, Matthew Macfadyen conveys a disarming vulnerability in the character.  <br /> <br />I'm not usually very moved by romance, but the scene in which Darcy crosses the meadow at dawn to find Elizabeth (yeah, well, it works here) is the singularly most romantic sequence I have ever seen in a film. It's lovely. <br /> <br />So I think of this as the \\"outdoorsy\\" version of the story. It's worth seeing just for the beautiful cinematography and the unexpectedly charming ambiance.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I anticipated seeing Kate Winslet in a romantic comedy, and was not disappointed.  For an enjoyable, carefree hour or so, it met the requirements, and gave me a greater appreciation of Jude Law as a well-rounded single father, and introduced me to the charm of Jack Black.  Cameron Diaz's character was predictable, but Eli Wallich was a surprising charmer.  Some may consider it a little light in story line, but I appreciated the joy of just enjoying the various actors as they excelled in their roles. <br />

A lot different then the other bond films, since this is like the first one story in the series. Same sexy action packed fun like the others. This is a must buy movie!!
B000MV9026|4.0|This is a well intentioned film with a very entertaining storyline. The animations is quite good but nowhere does it outshine or outclass Disneys CARS. This film did not deserve the academy award. It was weak in alot of ways from anination to plot...Cars on the otherhand was outstanding from top to bottom and is one of the best animated films of all times. Was Disney robbed yes....The only reason This Penguin movie won the award is for thhe topic of pollution and global warming. It is a good movie to have in your collection by all means. It is funny at times and the musical tributes are wonderful a film for all ages BUT as IMHO Ill take CARS over this film any day...

B000MCH5P4|4.0|There was something about this movie which grabs the viewer's attention right from the beginning.  There are four intertwined stories. An American couple is visiting Morocco and their children are in the care of a Mexican nanny in the U.S.  There is also a fourth story which involves an adolescent female from Japan. During the whole movie I was wondering how the Japanese story would relate to the other stories but you find out towards the end. <br /> <br />The acting by everyone is great. Besides Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, all the other actors are unknown.  A lot of the movie is in Arabic, Japanese and in Spanish. In addition, the female in Japan is deaf/mute. It is interesting when they turn of the volume sometimes during her scenes to show us how she sees the world.  The movie has great acting, and a great storyline.  The scenery in Mexico, Morocco and Japan is nice and it really gives you a feel for those countries. <br /> <br />I would just give it four stars because I don't understand why the young boy from Morocco looks at his sister while she is changing or why the lady from Japan is naked in front of her Dad. I don't understand what the director's purpose was in showing those scenes. <br /> <br />When I finished the movie I was wondering what kind of message the director was trying to relay.  The only thing which I could thing of was how privileged the American couple where in relation to the Moroccan people.  I know if any Moroccan person in that village had a fatal wound they definitely would not be flown by helicopter to Casablanca. But maybe there was no message, maybe the director simply wanted to make a good movie. <br />
B0009MAP9A|5.0|I must admit that I'm one of those people that just didn't get Dylan. I liked many of his songs but actually prefered the cover versions to the originals and being more into the music rather than the lyrics, really didn't see what the fuss was about. Well I've gone back and revisited Bob and now I get it, both his folk flavored material and his band oriented works.<br /><br />On The Times They Are A-Changeing Dylan manages with just acoustic guitar, occasional harmonica and Bob's ragged voice, to make one of his most powerfully emotional albums. Perhaps the darkest of his career, certainly the starkest and it's just beautiful. Beautiful in it's simplicity and beautiful in the directness of the oftimes sad and timeless stories he tells.This is Dylan's most overt protest album, quietly yet powerfully raging against social injustice. Now while I very much like Dylan's band oriented material such as Highway 61 Revisited or Desire or Blonde On Blonde this album, Dylan's third, is a distilled essence of pure Dylan. There arn't any frills or fat, no drums or overdubs. It's just Bob and has become my favorite album by him.

0767811070|3.0|john singleton was in hisearly 20s when he directed this movie and was supposed to become one of the great directors; unfortunately he has done nothing in the nearly 20 years since to justify that early bit of over-praise. what we DO have here is a good but uneven debut feature drawn from the experiences its creative team had lived thru in growing up in the LA ghetto, highlighted by solid acting turns by laurence fishburne, cuba gooding, and especially morris chestnut. like so much of the african-american community, singleton seems to be an artist of unfulfilled promise. sad. <br />
B000MV9026|5.0|Exceelent movie all because, it's good for growing kids to know there more to entertainment than just being entertained.  I think it's pretty brave and daring to open up such a subject for the world to take out time and pay close attention to.   <br /> <br />Let's continue to raise our children with being entertain, but also with some sort of light to shine on their conscious to also repsect other living things on this planet that need our assistance to survive.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Movie series can tend to get worse as they go on--for various reasons like lack of new inspiration, stories getting stale, etc. However, this movie breathes new life into the bond franchise. <br /> <br />Despite the controversy with the new Bond actor, you'd be wrong to say that Daniel Craig doesn't rate among the top Bond actors...if not THE top. Being a fan of Sean Connery and finding it hard to believe that anyone else could say that he wasn't the best Bond, it wasn't even hard for me to come to a new conclusion after seeing this movie...Craig is now the best. That should say a lot... <br /> <br />Aside from that, the movie begins with some old-school filming tactics, and once the action starts your heart rate is sure to be on a continuous rise until the very end. We see Craig shaping a new Bond, despite our view of the character over the years. I can say confidently that as long as he is at the helm, we'll see some great things over the next few years for Bond...
B000MGUZKM|5.0|This is the CD we have all been waiting for. Randy and Joe together again.....Randy Crawford doesn't disapoint on such tracks as \\"Feeling Good\\" and \\"But Beautiful\\"...but really every song is a winner!

B0000009OP|5.0|My heart is all over Cure for Pain. The album details heartache, deceit, letting oneself down, fear, worry, pain and other miserable topics with such beauty and levity that it makes your real pain feel okay. There is a kind of catharsis after listening to the album in it's entirety - which to me is the only way to listen to it. I agree with most the other reviewers that the standout tracks are \\"Buena,\\" \\"In Spite of Me\\" and \\"Cure for Pain.\\" I love \\"All Wrong\\" because it is just SO sexy - the lyric \\"She had black hair like ravens crawling over her shoulders / All the way down\\" gets me every time! But \\"Thursday,\\" which simply tells the story of an adulterous affair gone awry always puts a smile on my face because it is so right on. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, and what other band can you think of that has a saxophone playing lead? WTF!?!?
0517201658|5.0|This novel is truly unforgettable. Comparisons to the mini-series will always be made and whilst the mini-series makes for gripping viewing, this book with its touching story and expert writing offers something deliciously tangible to savour and enjoy...  <br /> <br />The story runs for generations, following the lives and evolution of a range of extremely well crafted and complex characters, involving unrequited love, death, passion, betrayal and the sweetest kind of heartbreak...this book has it ALL and that is not an understatement!  <br /> <br />Individual plot lines are intricately woven, generations pass, words spill across the pages evocatively, and scenes so real will chill you and create lasting imagery. You will go back to re-read lines simply to savour favourite phrases... You will cry and laugh with the characters... You will forget your troubles and lose yourself... <br /> <br />There is the mother who can't love and the tragic reasons why... There is the husband who will never quite posses her... The son who never really belongs, yet is the only one who matters... The man whose lifelong struggle amounts to exquisite pain, just like a fable... And of course at the centre, the woman who longs and loves - and loses.   <br /> <br />I would say a love story is the centrepiece of the book. Well, not so much a love story, as a love SAGA.... Don't be put off thinking this is a mushy romance, as that would be your grave misfortune. This is a book to immerse yourself in, as one would immerse a cold body in a hot bath. You couldn't hope to do that without getting wet, and you can't hope to read this book without becoming completed absorbed. This is compelling stuff.  <br /> <br />Masterfully, the writing is clear and captivating - not at all 'flowery' or overtly crafted. At the core of this book, i would say is a study of our strengths and weaknesses, of our inescapable longing to be loved, and of the deseration that arises when we can't have what we want. Team that with original characters, stories and dialogue and you have a story that will be with you long after you have said goodbye to the last page. READ it!

How anyone could get an Oscar for this tripe is beyond me. No story line, not funny, vulgar beyond comprehension (when you can't write, you write vulgarity...really takes a lot of skill to do this), basically a total waste of time.

B00005JPKC|2.0|and it bored me to death by watching it. and there were lot of movies about the second world war, but this movie unfortunately carried the most boring and dead-beat storyline. while 'flag of our fathers' was full of hollow parties and big words, 'letters from iwo jima' was even worse, not just boring, but subtly insert a message to let you see how cruel and abusive the japanese high ranking officers were to their subordinate soldiers. there almost nothing worth to be seen in this hollow and boring movie. i just have to say that both the 'flag' and the 'letters' sucked big time. they were two of the worst movies in my viewing experience, and they didn't even deserve my time to write reviews, because it's simply dumb after i've already wasted almost over 5 hours sitting through them.
B000NVIGC0|2.0|this is boring. really boring. these songs, except for the first track, sound like outtakes from the third Wilco album, released in 1997, or perhaps songs that should have been free with a purchase of \\"The Wilco Book\\". Some of it is okay, though.
B000000YG5|5.0|This is a milestone album, not just in jazz, but in the history of recorded music. I will never forget walking into a record store as a child and hearing this music for the first time. Sonny Rollins had the genius to create music on an new level; one that took the elements of BEBOP and created a deeper melodic and rhythmic foundation. And the recording of this album pointed to the music of the Beatles and beyond. This is jazz at its greatest and most alluring level. This album rocks, it rolls and it grooves in a way that no other \\"recording: had done before, and that few have done since. If you want to learn what the hightest art can achieve, you can listen to this for an entire life time. Sonny, you are the greatest. And you will always be remembered for this masterpiece.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Mind-boggling beautiful and such an intense reminder of our precious world.  Yes, I'm a total environmentalist/hippie type.  I've been digitally taping the American version w/ S. Weaver & then stumbled upon this version.  Just like with Walking with Dinosaurs - BBC version is with Kenneth Branaugh, and I can't remember the American version's narrator - the warmth and intelligence of the narrator MAKES the viewing so much superior... go BBC! So, guess what, I'm buying this version for a permanent keepsake & to enjoy D. Attenborough's mellifluous voice over and over.  Love ya Sigourney, but come one, who wrote your dialogue???  ...once again proving how we can thoroughly muck things up here in the new world.  What, do we think people won't understand someone speaking with an British accent, and have to be reminded every other sentence about the never before seen (outside of cinematic production) the quality of the filming? har har.  Okay, enough of my ranting.  Enjoy Enjoy Enjoy!  Just being given the opportunity to see so much of this teeny tiny planet that 99.9% percent of us will never normally get to see is more than worth the price of admission.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is hands down one of my favorite movies of all time. It's dark, it's in your face, it's reality. I personally do not like sugar coated movies with the superficial ending. Give it to me raw. That's just what this movie will do for you.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movie, I won't give away the plot, but it makes you think about our behaviors when we are so pressed to reach a \\"dream\\" or a goal. Sometimes we'll do anything just to get \\"it\\"...hence the name of the movie.<br /><br />If you like dark movies with the internal views portrayed, this movie is for you.<br /><br />Now that I think of it....I may watch this movie, this weekend.

0307346609|4.0|Brooks' \\"World War Z\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable, gruesome piece of not-quite-the-apocalypse fiction; I would recommend it to anyone looking for something that they'll have finished within 24 hours, and who does not mind being terrified of the dark for at least a good week afterwards.  The story, pacing, and explanation for the zombies was just the right mix of camp, action, and \\"woe is mankind!\\" reflection, sort of a Buffy meets Michael Crichton's \\"Jurassic Park\\" with a healthy dose of Stephen King's \\"The Stand.\\"
B000N6TX1I|4.0|This is a movie that grows on you and comes back into your mind days after viewing it.  The level of detail demands rewatching, or at least reflection and digestion.  From background graffiti to signs and advertisements, \\"Children of Men\\" creates a near future of unusual thoroughness.  The sets, vehicles, matte paintings, soundtrack, and creation of factions that have riven Britain all combine to immerse the viewer in an imagined society.  Check out a fantastic recreation of the album cover to Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\" complete with huge flying pig, and if you missed any of the film's technical brilliance, the special features will tell you all about it.  The most stunning aspect of \\"Children of Men\\" is the continuous shots where hundreds of extras and the main characters interact for minutes at a time, as opposed to the usual breakdown into dozens of sequences.  The film ends with an urban firefight every bit as good as anything in \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" and is even reminiscent of the final shootout in \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" If you liked \\"Nineteen Eighty-four,\\" \\"Blade Runner,\\" or \\"Brazil,\\" you will be in good company with Clive Owen and Julianne Moore in \\"Children of Men.\\"
B000MXPE74|5.0|This album reminds me of light Rancid.  It has some great rhythms and the lyrics are surprisingly good for a pseudo-punk sound.  The first 2 songs start the album off well.  Personally, I think \\"Henrietta\\" is a much stronger tune than \\"Flathead\\".  The rest of the album switches from more melodically punk to some slower stuff.  All in all this is one of the best and most original bands I have heard in a while.

It's a five song set, with incredibly varied, consistently high-quality material throughout.  It arguably has no real down time or \\"filler,\\" with the possible exception of the wandering experimentation on Moonchild.  Even that is debatable, however, as some experimentation is always welcome on any album.<br /><br />The album is great from start to finish, and really has no equal.  There is no other album which compares to this one in style--not even King Crimson's later efforts.  This \\"golden period\\" in their career was one which was never repeated.  Though they were able to capture a similar level of originality and grandiosity in later albums (In the Wake of Poseidon, Red) they never did reach the same level of quality as on their debut.<br /><br />1.  21st Century Schizoid Man - Sets the perfect tone for the album.  Epic, overblown and sporadic, moving in many different directions all at once.  Mystical, political, jazzy and experimental, this is one of King Crimson's most well-known and noteworthy tracks.  It isn't the absolute best on the album, but does an excellent job of grabbing the listener and making them wonder what else is in store over the course of this unique album.  The band's creative, free-form style is showcased excellently on this opening piece.<br /><br />2. I Talk to the Wind - If you thought that the whole album was going to be comprised of the hyperactive, jazz-infused rocking out which was flaunted during the previous track, think again.  I Talk to the Wind is a laid back, introspective song.  It's dreamy and folk-like, and makes evident King Crimson's ability to restrain themselves as a band, and resist the urge to rock out in order to write varied material.  A wholly satisfying song, which complements the album perfectly.  Includes a cool little jam with mellotron and drums at the end.<br /><br />3. Epitaph - After the break that was I Talk to the Wind, King Crimson take us on another extravagant adventure.  This time, the tone is less quirky and more sincere, with lyrics that verge on heart-wrenching.  The subject matter is earnest and grandiose, with otherworldly, expansive instrumentation and a reflective, powerful vocal performance by Greg Lake.  The creative, off-beat and glorious drumming talents of Mike Giles are put to excellent use, especially as the song builds to its towering climax.  This is easily one of the most enjoyable songs on the album, and stands as one of the greatest examples of King Crimson's importance.<br /><br />4. Moonchild - Here is another more relaxed, toned-down track, with a greater emphasis on experimentation than I Talk to the Wind.  Esoteric and unpredictable, Moonchild is quite mysterious and beautiful in its downbeat, fractured nature.  Though the song can be eerie and unappealing to listen to on its own, due to its lack of resolution and meandering nature, when taken in context with the rest of the album, it's an eccentric masterpiece.<br /><br />5. In The Court of the Crimson King - This is the track which everyone has been waiting for, by the time they're through with the rest of the album.  The title track is a sprawling, prog rock masterpiece, which utilizes every single one of the band's strengths.  The lyrics are especially fantastical and relevantly surrealistic.  Robert Fripp's mellotron once again steals the show by adding a healthy dose of psychadelic, awe-inspiring, layered harmony over the rest of the band.  The song is over 9 minutes in length, with a false-ending 7 and a half minutes in.  The song goes quiet, and then a keyboard plays a twisted, stripped-down version of the main melody, before the other instruments join in for an encore of the song's infectious, inspiring chorus.  This time, however, Greg Lake takes a break and a strange \\"electricity\\" patch is used on the keyboardto great effect.  Some of the finest moments in prog rock come at the end of this magnum opus.used on the keyboard to great effect.  Some of the finest moments in prog rock come at the end of this magnum opus.
075640407X|5.0|I would say that there are three types of books. One is the book that you cannot finish no matter how hard you attempt to, the next would be the ones that you read and enjoy but you are eager to finish so that you can move to the next book, and a few are the ones that you enjoy so much that as you get nearer the end you are saddened, the book is so enjoyable you do not wish it to end. This one falls into the third category for me. I found the characters well developed and admirable and I am saddened that this book is finished. An outstanding first book, Kvothe's story held my interest from start to finish and left me sad that I must wait for the next book.

B000KJU182|5.0|Billy Budd is a moving, engaging and well acted and produced movie from the early 1960s.  Its depiction of good vs. evil and the blurred lines between these two extremes is as relevant now as it was then.  Its black and white art direction and cinematography are outstanding.   <br />Its presentation on this DVD is excellent - sharp and crystal clear.  As a huge and long-time fan of Terence Stamp (this was his first film), his commentary during the movie is very interesting (especially how he got the role).  Highly recommended for lovers of fine classics.

B00005KK4P|4.0|There is no way for me to make my review short and sweet, so instead I will point out EVERYTHING I can about these CD's, and then you can decide if this product is right for you. I have always been a big fan of Mozart and Beethoven, and only recently have learned to appreciate the genius of Schubert. I have listened to over four versions of the 4th, 8th, and 9th symphonies, and I would put these versions somewhere in the middle of the pack. In my opinion they are better that The Academy of St. Martin in the Fields's version (Which is TOO FAST) but not as good as Claudio Abbado and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. Abbado's versions are BEAUTIFUL recordings, but that set costs over $150. Let's face it, you get what you pay for. (FYI -I have never heard Muti's versions). Now, as far as the actual fidelity/ sound quality of the recordings, they are just a notch below the rest. I did notice this when I played several versions back-to-back with this one. (Once again- you get what you pay for). If you are a casual listener of classical music, or you are looking for an economical way to get exposure to all of Schubert's symphonies, then this is probably the right set for you. (How can you beat the price ??) If you are a real die- hard classical listener, I want to point out one other thing: These versions do not repeat the exposition in the first movements. They play it once and then go right to the development section. For those of you who don't know what I am talking about- ignore this- never mind, and think about the other things that I said. I hope that I have been helpful. I will finish by saying that I'm amazed by the genius of Schubert and his music, and I encourage anyone who loves classical music to listen to these symphonies (esp 4,8, and 9) regardless of which version you buy.
B00002EPJH|5.0|Let's hear it for music. I actually stood up and applauded after typing that first sentence. I really did. But now I'm seated again about to tell you what I think of this great album. I like moonlight and I like music. Call me sentimental. Keith jarrett has created something right up my alley here. Eleven fine melodies, and he coaxes the charms out of each one with exquisite sensitivity and taste. Each note played sounds about perfect. Notes twinkling between thoughts and feelings. A perfect late night album. As I sat and listened last evening it felt that life is indeed good. What more can an artist do for you? This is quiet and contemplative piano jazz at its best. If it sounds like something you might like, then it is. Don't miss out. <br />
B000MQC9H4|1.0|I'm sorry but this movie is just so cheesy ,people do not act like this. Your not going to have a hi powered movie executive switch places with a frumpy poor girl. Jack Black is just a horrid actor, why do we have to spend one more second looking at his dumb face. Listening to him doing the humming,duba dooodle dooo doooo, made me want run from from my living room, and jump off the nearest bridge. Not to mention that the trailer guy in the movie was really getting old after the fourth or fifth time. Stay away from this if you demand good movies,this is just gloopy yeck.
B000002GVO|4.0|the hotel california, baby. in my neck of the musical woods (been listening to a lot of john coltrane lately) you are supposed to dislike the eagles. pure snobbery. i will have none of it. this is a fantastic album. the closing number, \\"the last resort,\\" is reason enough alone to have this thing in your home. an absolutely beautiful song. seven minutes and twenty-five seconds of exquisite songcraft. not really a dud song anywhere on the album, in fact. this is the eagles masterpiece. no doubt. commercial music that is heartfelt, emotional, and fine. don't be a snob. check it out.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|The movie was ok ,somewhat tedious at times ,alot of the same thing. I think it must be said though that although Chris Gardner was an ambitious guy who never gave up. He was guilty of making many bad decisions. Buying all of those machines, with no distributer. Taking an internship with no salary for 6 months with a small child. I'm glad it worked out for him. It seems like I've known guys like this throughout my life ,sometimes they do make it,but more often they take a nosedive and pull people down with them.
B0000025D0|5.0|springsteen's 1973-1978 years were an amazing run, almost as great as the rolling stones 1968-1972 years. each album that he released in this stretch of time was fantastic. \\"darkness on the edge of town\\" is his starkest production from that era. a masterpiece that is intense and dramatic, with a big drum and bass sound, and several of the finest songs in our rock and roll canon. \\"badlands,\\" \\"the promised land,\\" \\"prove it all night,\\" and the title track are all powerful, heavenly rock performances. \\"adam raised a cain,\\" \\"something in the night,\\" and \\"streets of fire,\\" may be less known, perhaps less lauded, but are each great in their own right. the lyrical guitar solo and sax solo on \\"promised land\\" are both gorgeous; and the raw, wild telecaster sound of the solo on \\"streets of fire\\" is soul-stirring. bruce's voice is uninhibated, soars with emotion and drama, and is tremendous throughout. johnny cash. bob dylan. bruce springsteen: my trio of homegrown american voices that are indispensable (if you want to make it a quartet and throw in billy joe shaver, i won't argue). your life will seem vaguely empty without lots of music from these gentlemen around the house.
B000A3VTT8|5.0|I have this on VHS and it remains the standard so far as I'm concerned.
B0002KVULG|2.0|This is not a critique of the film itself.  That's been admirably done by all the above interested parties, pro and con.  I've got to put my two cents in about this DVD's visual quality.  As a film buff, I was eager to see Mr. Badham's original color concept.  If the transfer were bright and clear, I think I would have been well satisfied.  But beware!...Most key scenes are so dark as to make the viewer squint in frustration trying to make sense of the visuals.  Worse yet - The \\"bright\\" scenes appear to have been photographed through a misty, gray cloud.  If you truly admire this film, please think twice about purchasing.  Rent it instead, if you must.
6305308659|5.0|When I first started watching this movie I thought it was going to be silly and fun, but it was much, much more than that. As the plot thickens and the storyline goes deeper we see a growing metaphor not just for racism, but for bigotry in general. The struggle for safety vs. freedom is a struggle we face in our world today, and perhaps always have. Freedom involves taking risks, and in the process we lose the security we thought we had - like when the men no longer can count on a hot meal on the table when they come home - but actually gain by seeing their wives in a new light.<br /><br />The book burning scene was, of course, particularly moving to me. I cried. I would. As each character discovers their passion, they change from black and white to color - much to their chagrin, as \\"coloreds\\" are relegated to back rooms and alleyways. Once they find their passion, however, there is no going back.<br /><br />As nostalgic as I can get at times, would I go back? Would you?[[ASIN:B00005OLBC Aimee and Jaguar]]
096798467X|5.0|Kiko Denzer's gifts as an artist and teacher shine in this 3rd edition. Building an earthen oven is the perfect project to satisfy many desires and \\"Build Your Own Earth Oven\\" speaks to many of those desires eloquently and practically. With Kiko as a guide you can make something that is fun, useful, artful, cheap, practical and beautiful. And then, thanks to Hannah Field's expertise as a baker, you can enjoy delicious and healthy artisan breads, and so much more.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the simple explanations of the physics of building with mud and baking in earth. The numerous illustrations beautifully support the clear instructions on building and finishing an oven, and the thorough and practical advice about using the oven well, troubleshooting and baking make this book a very useful tool.<br /><br />As a natural builder I've found that building an earthen oven is the ideal first project to gain experience, insight and enthusiasm for the beauty and benefits of building with natural materials. If you use the lessons offered in \\"Build Your Own Earth Oven\\" you just might realize the innate wisdom you already possess as a human being - engaging your hands, heart and head to create, to engage life, to do something useful. Or, as Kiko has also wisely pointed out, you can \\"...just make a mud oven so you can bake your own bread.\\"<br /><br />Beatifully illustrated, well-written and immensely useful, I heartily recommend this book.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Great movie, great acting.  I cannot believe people who do not like Daniel Craig as Bond.  I was skeptical like most but he was fantastic.

B000MQC9H4|4.0|I am not a big Nancy Meyers fan, but I did enjoy What Women Want and thought I'd give this a whirl.  The Holiday is a sweet, feel-good romantic movie that impresses in some areas and underwhelms in others.  More on that later. Amanda (Cameron Diaz), a creator of movie trailers from L.A., has just broken up with her boyfriend and wants to get away and be alone for a while. Iris (Kate Winslet), a London newspaper writer, is heartbroken as well.  The man, a colleague, she loves and has pined over for years has become engaged to another woman and she wants to put some distance between them.  So when Amanda finds a home exchange travel program on the Internet (using Google, a very obvious product placement ad within the film) and finds the perfect vacation spot -- a small, picturesque cottage in Surrey, England -- she contacts the owner (Iris) and they agree to trade places for a couple of weeks.  Iris has the time of her life in L.A., where she meets some interesting people (including a retired screenwriter played by veteran actor Elli Wallach) and becomes friends with a sweet film music composer (Jack Black), whereas Amanda is bored out of her mind... until she meets Iris's gorgeous and enigmatic brother (Jude Law).<br /><br />This is the sort of movie you either want to enjoy with your girlfriends or watch by yourself when you're in the mood for something warm and fuzzy.  The script is well written and it isn't the typical romantic comedy in that the characters are one-dimensional for the most part.  In this film, you get moving performances, especially from Kate Winslet.  She once again showcases her talent in this one and her character's kindness and transparency to loving and caring for others is wonderful.  I was also impressed with the fact that she and Black had chemistry.  I often avoid a Jack Black movie like the plague, but he was actually endearing in this film.  Cameron Diaz underwhelms as Amanda though.  She played a character not unlike most of her romantic comedy heroines.  Even though I liked the chemistry between her and Jude Law, I found myself more interested in Winslet and Black.  As for the setting, I loved the beautiful takes of Iris's English cottage and the village she lives in.  They were so much more eye-catching than the mansions and palm trees in Los Angeles.  All in all, this is a great film.  The DVD is not that great though.  The picture quality is not that great and you don't get any special features (at least not the one I got).

B00000AF95|4.0|As a tribute to the former KISS guitarist Mark St. John, I'd like to present a review for this very good KISS album.  ANIMALIZE is one of the best hard rock albums from the 80's AND one of the best ones KISS released during the period.  I kinda see Animalize as part of the KISS HEAVY 80's trilogy(Creatures of the Night, Lick it up and Animalize). With the departure of original guitarist Ace Frehley, KISS strived to put KISS back together with a revolving door for lead guitarist before finally landing Bruce Kulick (who was with the band for 12 years) after the fueding with Vinnie Vincent and the unfortunate sickness developed by Mark St. John forcing him to leave the band prematurely (Mark had an arthritis disease that would sometimes hinder him to play guitar).  <br /> <br />Animalize is just a great album.  It was produced by Paul Stanley and has some of his heaviest and best work on it. At the time, to me, it was the closest thing to sort of getting a second Paul Stanley solo album.  Paul really poured himself into the album. It was also recorded at a time where Gene was becoming MR. Hollywood while starring in a film with Tom Selleck-leaving Paul to oversee the album and the band! It also features some awesome, thunderous drumming by KISS' late, great drummer ERIC CARR (who also died tragicly from cancer in 1991).  <br /> <br />The best song on the album and still a very popular KISS Classic is HEAVEN'S ON FIRE.  It also contains the second single THRILLS IN THE NIGHT.  Other heavy hitters are UNDER THE GUN and I'VE HAD ENOUGH.   <br />The Gene songs are actually pretty good=Particularly my fav LONELY IS THE HUNTER (Which actually had Bruce Kulick on the track)and the cool BURN BITCH BURN.  <br /> <br />The album is just very heavy from start to finish and sounds very sleek to this day.  The order of songs gives the album a hot bone crushing feel and the mix is awesome=and even more polished since it was remastered in 1998! Though the band was kinda still in turmoil musicly with Ace gone, Mark St. John came into the KISS mix with some great guitar solos that really breathed new life into KISS and transitioned the band great into a powerhouse band that still could steal the thunder away from any rock band out at the time.  It's just too bad Mark got sick. Who knows how much more he could have contributed to the band.  After Mark was doing better, he did form a band called WHITE TIGER and released a self titled cd.  Also, in 1999 he came back on the music scene and did KISS Expos and released the MARK ST. JOHN PROJECT EP and then released a mostly instrumental cd in 2003 called Magic Bullet Theory--showcasing his outstanding, versitale and talented guitar playing.   <br /> <br />Sadly, Mark died of a brain hemmorage in April 2007.  Though he is gone, his music shall live on.  Mark was in KISS for not even a year, but made KISSTORY as being a feature player on one of the best KISS cds not to feature the original band and contributed to the band a new take on the KISS sound and moving the band forward in longevity.   <br /> <br />If you want a great hard rock 80's cd, get ANIMALIZE and get to hear the hottest band in the world play with the late great guitar shredder at the time-Mark St. John.
B00005JPLU|5.0|After the train wreck that was Troy and the passability of Alexander I decided that to go and see any movie that was adapted from the pages of history, one has to turn a blind eye and accept the fact that Hollywood will sprinkle it with stardust, romanticize it,  change the plots and endings, pretty it all up, tie it with a big bow and churn it out to the public.  300 was entirely different!  Firstly is was adapted from Frank Miller to screen and that is a huge plus straight off, then Zack Snyder brought it to the screen in all its dark glory.  This is noir film making at its best!!!  It also came very close the history of King Leonides and his 300 taking their last stand at Thermopylae. I'm not going to gripe about how they exagerated King Xerxes, the priests and oracle on top of that mountain, certain exagerated deformed monsters, (Ephiliates being slightly deformed but not to the degree depicted in the film). There is a lot of symbolism used here.  King Xerxes DID think of himself as a God like King and the Persians were a force to be reckoned with.  Sparta was depicted in a civilised light, BUT Sparta WAS a cruel society, harsh even, killing new borns that were deformed, not strong and underweight, training  boys for war and sending them off at the age of seven to face unknown horrors.  Having said that, I felt that the movie had the mood of war and death and watching those spartan soldiers fighting knowing that there was no hope, I truly felt the glory in their death and what it meant for them.  Gerard Butler did an excellent job of King Leonides, I could not imagine  anyone else playing him, and the rest of the cast were excellent.  I am so happy that they did not use the world's most famous actors, as I truly think that the film would have suffered for it.  (think of Troy and the campy acting of the overly roasted Brad Pitt).  And THANKYOU Zack Snyder for not changing the ending and having King Leonides and his 300 live and walk off into the sunset (think ofParis and Helen walking off into the sunset in Troy thanks to the over inflated ego of Wolfgang Peterson and his screen writer) For that is what I am most grateful for that this film has stayed true to the simple story of those Spartan Soldiers making their last stand at Thermopylae. Simply, a great film adapted from the visionary Frank Miller brought beautifully to the big screen.  Well done!!!!
B000J103N4|4.0|This is a 5 star recording, but with several caveats.  I agree with Adam Janson's review- I also know there is additional music around.  It's not hard to go on line and search for a bootleg called \\"Everybody Here Can Be In The Band.\\"  It has some earlier mixes of songs, and additional jams as well as other songs that didn't make the album.  There is another live bootleg of Crosby and various Dead members called \\"David And The Dorks\\" which was a live concert from December 1970.  Why wasn't any of this material used? <br />Also disappointing is the short picture gallery, which doesn't include all the original pictures from the original record sleeve.  And, although a video is listed, there is none. <br />What a sad way to disappoint those of us who consider this to be one of the greatest albums ever released. <br />Buyer- beware.  You're getting less than you deserve, especially at this high price.

B000LAZDQA|5.0|Well, with the opening scene of Shortbus, you know you're in store for a very different kind of film.  The explicit sex seen in the first few minutes is perhaps the most graphic, most real sex scenes I've ever seen in a \\"mainstream\\" movie.  Director John Cameron Mitchell most certainly knows how to grab your attention from the start.<br /><br />If you're not too shocked and stick around for the rest, you'll find this movie has much more to offer than cheap thrills.  This movie treats sex more honestly than any other I've ever seen.  The gritty, graphic nature of the sex throughout the film shows a side of relationships rarely captured on the big screen.<br /><br />There are multiples stories going on here - one deals with a sex therapist on mission to finally achieve her first orgasm.  Another centers around a gay couple trying to make their longterm relationship work, even though one of them has his own demons of severe depression to work through.  All the characters and stories come together in a free-loving type club known as \\"Shortbus.\\"
B00004W50T|4.0|Okay, so the self-titled second completely blows this away, but this is still one of The Band's better albums - I've only heard three, so I'm not much of a judge of it. Still, this is an enjoyably rootsy affair. Of course it's got The Weight, a landmark '60's tune with interesting, oft-analyzed lyrics, a well-known chorus, a cool descending bassline, AND great traded lead vocals between Levon Helm, Richard Manuel (whose voice gives me the chills) and Rick Danko. The perfect song. Same with Chest Fever, which is pretty funky - sorta reminds me of Up on Cripple Creek from the next record. And have you heard how many times that organ riff's been imitated? Seriously, it's almost become a cliche now.<br />Of course, The Band will always be linked to Dylan, and three of these songs were written or cowritten by him. I like - no, LOVE - Tears of Rage,  prototypical enigmatic Dylan. Same with I Shall Be Released, which Dylan later recorded himself and admittedly did a better job on because he wisely got that stupid high-pitched synthesizer/organ/whatever-thing out of there. But I love Manuel's vocals on the song, so I can't complain too much. This Wheel's on Fire was Dylan's third contribution, and again it's funky, with a clavinet-sounding keyboard. Probably the weakest of his additions, but still, a good tune.<br />As I said, Manuel's vocals give me the chills, especially on Lonesome Suzie. Admittedly, the lyrics aren't among Robbie Robertson's best. But Manuel almost brings me to tears when he sings it. No joke. It's a hard song to listen to because of that, but I like it just the same.<br />Long Black Veil is the most fun you'll find here, an old folk song from BEYOND THE GRAAAAAAAVE with Ultimate Multi-Instrumentalist Garth Hudson adding what sounds like a tuba. A nice, uptempo, swinging song, one of the more underrated ones here.<br />So far it seems like it should be a five-star, but I can't get into some of this. Like To Kingdom Come, In a Station and Candelonia Mission. I just skip right over 'em. Really boring songs with weak lyrics. And while We Can Talk has fun traded vocals, I can't see much reason to listen to it outside of that. That's just me, though.<br />Though the next outing was an absolute five-star masterpiece that likely tops everything else The Band ever did (as I've said, I only know three of their albums: this, self-titled and Stage Fright, plus I've got that one-disc Best of the Band), this is an effecient warm-up to that album and recommended to fans of '60's rock, especially roots-rock. If you like this sound, I also recommend Creedence Clearwater Revival and the Stones' stuff from '68 to '72.<br />The bonus tracks are kind of wastes... I like Yazoo Street Scandal, it should've made the original album, and their version of Key to the Highway is good enough (partially because no-one can make that song bad, really), but most are poorly-written and recorded (Orange Juice Blues, Katie's Been Gone, Ferndidad the Imposter, etc).p right over 'em.

Jeff Kober(in a very rare comedic turn for this great character actor)managed to keep Booga the vigilant warrior,yet infuse the character with the innocent,childlike qualities,as called for in the original source material! Ice-T,grumpy,profoundly arrogant,scored as the Ripper,T-Saint. Malcolm McDowell,as the wickedly dark,Kesslee,finishes out the stand-out members of the cast.  <br />     The DVD of Tank Girl was a quality production,but simply the film,itself. There were no extras and this was a bit disappointing. There was a lot of controversy between the director of Tank Girl,Rachel Talalay, and the studio over the edit of the film. It would have been just grand if a lot of the deleted footage could have been added to the DVD. A director's commentary and reflections from the cast would also have been a welcome addition. However,on the whole,the DVD of Tank Girl is well worth the buy. <br />
B000002P6R|4.0|If you're looking to start a classic rock-related argument, one of the best ways is by bringing up the quality of The Who Mach 2: that is, the two albums released between Keith Moon's death and the group's long break from releasing studio material (though we all know too much about those cash-in \\"farewell tour/reunion tour\\" albums). Out of the two, It's Hard is simply an affront to the Who's name, but I like Face Dances. Yeah, Moony's trademark insanity is missed, yeah, Pete indulges himself in a bit of insincere complaining (Did You Steal My Money?, Daily Records), and there are a few toss-offs such as The Quiet One and How Do You Do It Alone. But I like this one. I really do. You Better You Bet is indisputedly The Who Mach 2's best song. Yeah, it's pure pop, but it's also filled with hooks and funny, less-than-subtle innuendos, so I can't complain. Radio favorites such as Don't Let Go the Coat and Cache Cache (with an el strangeo refrain) add a lot. The record closes out with a fine ballad-y/putdown thing called Another Tricky Day, and You is one of Entwistle's hidden treasures, a thundering rocker in the vein of My Wife. So it's not Who's Next or Tommy, but it's far better than It's Hard (or its predecessor, Who Are You).

1582701709|5.0|I know there is a lot of controversy surrounding The Secret.  But I don't care about all of that.  There are always going to be opposing views, and if you are looking to pick apart something and be skeptical, then certainly the message will not resonate within you as positive.  I have the DVD and the book and I think both of them are great.  I understand that this message is nothing new, but the way it's presented, has allowed me to fully understand and put the tools together for use in my daily life.  The book is beautiful and the materials used are quality.  I keep it by my bedside and pick it up to read a chapter here and there, just to refresh my mind with positive thoughts.  I do recommend reading The Secret!
0618680004|4.0|THE GOD DELUSION is aimed at changing the minds of religious believers, specifically Christians, though I doubt that many believers will be able to stomach Dawkins' no-holds-barred criticism of their faith.  His examinations of prayer, the Old-Testament Yahweh, and the nature of miracles are always cutting and often hilarious: \\"[Suicide bombers] were taught [that duty to God exceeds all other priorities] not necessarily by extremist fanatics but by decent, gentle, mainsteam religious instructors, who lined them up in their madrasas, sitting in rows, rythmically nodding their innocent little heads up and down while they learned every word of the holy book like demented parrots.\\" (p. 308)  If Dawkins expects many religious people to respond rationally to an assertion like this, he's going to be disappointed.  <br /> <br />Fortunately, as a treatise on why God is a foolish and dangerous fantasy, the book appeals just as much to non-believers as believers.  Here is a well-thought-out, carefully-researched exploration of the fallacies of religion, with close logic and good arguments.  One of the highlights is a sample of the hate-mail Dawkins has recieved from Christians (truly frightening).  He also presents a long and thorough exploration of the misunderstandings spread about evolution, including explanations of the anthropic principle and so-called irreducible complexity.  Every atheist would be well-advised to look at this chapter, if only to have a ready answer for intelligent design cliches like \\"how could ______ have come about by chance?\\"   <br /> <br />This book leaves few religious arguments standing, and any believer who does make it through will have some serious thinking to do.  At the same time, it is refreshing for the atheist who is tired of the same religious propaganda and would like to see some nonreligious propaganda for a change.  Again, this book is not likely to make many converts, but as a thoughtful criticism of religion, it is excellent.

B00004NHCC|5.0|What do you get when you team one of the most beautiful voices in the history of Jazz music (or any musical genre for that matter) with perhaps the greatest trumpet player in Jazz history - pure magic!  I can throw out all the cliche's and hyperbole in the world trying sway the rest of you out there who don't own this yet to purchase it immediately.  However, what am I going to say that will trump all of the critics (both pros and Amazon ams alike) who give this recording five stars w/out hesitating a second after they listen to it the first time?<br /><br />When my first child was born just recently, I choose three CD's out of my collection of over a thousand to take with me to the hospital and this was one of the three.  Believe it or not, everytime our baby boy has a crying fit, this is the only CD that will consistently get him to stop.  So obviously it has a huge place in my heart.<br /><br />I would give this two extra stars if I could.
B000M4RG4C|4.0|Good movie that tells the horrors and price that young men pay in war. There are many moments in the move that touched me and the story of the three men who raised the replacment flag and were proclaimed heroes is very interseting. <br /> <br />I would reccomend this movie to anyone, I cannot wait for the squel that shows the Japanese side.
B000784WMW|4.0|For those who haven't seen this it is a great version of the classic novel. Originally done as a BBC mini-series, it is a detailed but extremely engaging version. Timothy Dalton is wonderful (though probably too good looking for the real Rochester character). Since it was originally a miniseries with multiple episodes - it is a little annoying that each segment is separate, but other than that it is a wonderful purchase.
B0009R1T7M|3.0|I must begin by saying that this album is more creative, innovative, and meaningful than most music being processed today.  There are quite a few standout tracks that get stuck in the head, like \\"Come On, Feel the Illinoise!\\" and \\"The Man of Metropolis Steels Our Hearts.\\"  However, I only give the album three stars because overall, the album is a bit too bloated and fluffy.  Let me explain.  The album is a little over 70 minutes long.  There are over 20 tracks on the album.  This being said, alot of those 70 minutes during those twenty-something tracks are filler.  Yes, yes, they are minimalist-influenced tape loops and drones, but they drag the album down.  In between the standout tracks are tracks that--well--don't stand out.  Some of the songs are good for the first few verses, but just seem to go on too long without anything new to keep one's attention.  I've read many reviews that say you have to listen to the whole album all the way through to get the full impact of it, but honestly, I can't listen to this album without using the skip button.  So overall, the album is inconsistent in songwriting and varies quite a bit in pace, dragging in many places.<br /><br />I don't mean to \\"trash\\" this album.  I like the album.  I'm glad that I bought it.  But I cannot give it a glowing five-star review, because I think that the album is only a hint of Sufjan's full potential.  I greatly admire his enthusiasm in experimentation, however it's not always as rewarding to be on the receiving end of musical experimentation.  So, should you buy the album?  I would say yes: I think it's a major part of our musical landscape today, and will be looked upon in the future as a major part of popular musical history.  However, don't buy the album thinking it's perfect.  Buy the album expecting something different, something that's a bit rough around the edges, something that will throw you all kinds of unexpected twists and turns, and enjoy it for what it is, and skip the boring parts.  There's at least thirty minutes of good music here.ts.  There's at least thirty minutes of good music here.
B000002J1U|5.0|Third time around, and they get it right again.  From the squeak of Bonham's kickdrum (the requisite blues \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\") to Page's only performance on banjo (the gotcha-anyway \\"Gallows Pole\\") there ain't a duff track here.  It's a quantum leap sideways from the heaviness of LZ II, and the landing is perfect.  Criminy, \\"Celebration Day\\" is brilliant enough even with (actually, I think, because of) the botched intro - - when Jones's bass and Bonham's drums finally clamber in, the track takes off and carries the album with it; Page's guitar work on this track is awesome.  And Led Zeppelin had flirted with acoustic music before, but the full-blown folk rock on III proves their eclecticism once and for all - - \\"That's The Way\\" is simply beautiful in its melancholy.  It's a wildly diverse album, and as such shows that Led Zeppelin was at this point bursting with ideas.  Anyone remember Lucifer's Friend?  They copped Plant's Viking wail from the high-octane, octave-riffed \\"Immigrant Song\\" for the first song on their own debut.  So what, you say?  Exactly.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|Have you ever really looked forward to seeing a Film? I mean Really Excited and then after you watch, it is a Major Dissapointment! Sadly that was my experience with the Good Shepherd! I am Shocked at just how bad this film was! This Film had so many things going for it: MATT DAMON, ANGELINA JOLIE, WILLIAM HURT, ALEC BALDWIN and ROBERT DENIRO(acting and Directing), a Story Line that really hasnt been explored much in films, that is the beginning of The CIA. This Movie Should have Been Great, So what Happened? Well, to start off, this movie is LONG and SLOW, clocks in at 160 Minutes(felt like 160 hours). There really isnt any excitement, no major cloak and dagger incidents. The Cold War with Russia should have been explored way more but in this film, it just gets a glossy over. The film kept going back and forth from the late 1930's-early 1940's to the late 1950's-early 1960's but what Deniro forgot to do was age Matt Damon when they did go back and forth, Matt plays a 20 year in  1939 and in 1959 , he still looks like a little boy, this was very distracting in the film and I had a hard time figuring out what period the film was in. I guess after the producers paid Matt, Angelina and Deniro, their huge salaries, they couldnt afford a decent makeup artist. The Film is also very depressing, not many happy people in this film, matt damon's character is miserable throughout, keeps everyone at a distance.   On The Plus Side, Matt Damon was Excellent in the role, he really does get into the character and the film does offer some interesting history about the CIA. Still, I was VERY Dissapointed in this film and I cannot recommend it!
B000MNP2K8|5.0|i bought the dvd for my boyfriend, i usually dont like james bond, but i LOVED it...and watched it twice in the first week we got it!
B000AYEL6U|4.0|I love Elizabeth Gaskell's \\"Wives & Daughters\\" so much that I just had to try this mini-series also based on one of her novels.  It didn't disappoint me -- I cannot honestly put it up there with Wives ... only Pride & Prejudice can go on that shelf ... but it sure runs a close second!  The very first hour of the series had me alittle skeptical and semi-hooked, but then it got really intriguing and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole series!  The tension between the two main characters reminded me so much of Pride & Prejudice ... I just loved it.   If you're a fan of either of those aforementioned series, you will love this one too ... maybe not as much, but it's well worth your time to watch & find out!
B000N6TX1I|4.0|The HD-DVD edition has both the HD & the standard DVD versions.  That means that if you currently don't have an HD-DVD player, you can still watch this film on your DVD player.  You can enjoy the HD-DVD version later on if you decide to upgrade.  According to the review on DVDtimes.co.uk, the extras on this HD-DVD edition are the same as on the DVD (non-HD-DVD) version.  On the other hand, 2 reasons to buy the standard DVD version are to save some money (at least $7) and/or if you know that you won't hop on the HD-DVD bandwagon at all. <br /> <br />I'm glad that I saw Children of Men in the theatre because it's a great film that comes to life on the big screen.  The apocalyptical atmosphere was utterly convincing and tragic.  Someday, our world may experience a similar predicament.  I was blown away by the long sequences that appeared to be continuous, not unlike news reporting camerawork.  My favorite aspect of the movie is Clive Owen's performance.  I could feel his desperation to survive, even though the society he inhabited did not offer much to live for.  What he decided to do that set the course for the rest of the film reminded me of Léon (aka The Professional).  Without a doubt, he  is one of the finest and most charismatic actors in film.  Can't wait for Sin City 2 to come out. <br /> <br />
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Alfonso Cuaron has done it again.  After the masterful, underrated \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\\" he has directed the motion picture which sums up the anxieties of our post-9/11 age with an astonishing, poetic intensity which sears the soul.  I haven't felt this unsettled since the first time I saw Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\"  Yes, it's that good.  Cuaron is truly a poet of the seemingly random moment which takes your breath away ...
B00005JMAH|5.0|This film, because it's a fantasy and features children, has been underrated and overlooked by most critics.  What Alfonso Cuaron has achieved here has not, in fact, been recognized by any critic.  His true subject is not Harry Potter, but rather the magic of cinema itself.  The clues are too be found in the literally magical camera moves, such as through windows, and the use of transitions from scene to scene which have not been generally used since silent cinema.  This movie is the most perfect film fantasy yet made, which is an enormous achievement because fantasy movies are the hardest to bring to a state of perfection.  The proof is to ask yourself:  what perfect fantasy movie do I remember watching?  Probably you will answer with \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" which is an immortal achievement, but probably the only real competition to Cuaron's Azkaban.
0151013047|5.0|One of the ironies of this powerful tale is that the narrator uses the power of narrative not to postpone death, as Scheherazade did in the \\"Arabian Nights,\\" but to bring about its occurrence at the end of this tale.  I read this book because of Philip Pullman's favorable comments, and I must say that I was glad that I did.  Other ironies, such as the use of politeness and courtesy as weapons, emerge as the tale unfolds itself.  By the way, I challenge anyone to come up with a more concise summation of this book than the one I gave above as the title of my review.
B000E1MXSW|4.0|`The Nun's Story' is an engaging tale about an aspiring nun who wishes to serve in the missions of the Belgian Congo. Multi-faceted Audrey Hepburn makes the story absorbing enough with her excellent performance as Sister Burt.  There's the drama of the Congo, World War II is breaking out in Europe, and her vocation is on the line, but mainly we care about her own development. <br /> <br />The inner conflict is written all over Hepburn's face as she grapples with self-will. Obedience being the hardest vow, she, nevertheless, finds perfectionism, a manifestation of pride, her biggest stumbling block. Having a low tolerance for her own failures, she meets into agnostic-skeptic Dr. Fortunati played with colorful zest by Peter Finch. He challenges her motivation and makes her contemplate \\"a change of habit\\" to sport another movie's title. Then, with war beginning in Europe, she struggles with the community's edict to remain nuetral.   <br /> <br />Constrasting Hepburn's role in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's,' she really demonstrates a conflicted, resolute, yet fragile nun with great skill. Hepburn is the centerpiece because even with a good story, she makes us care deeply about her character. The movie makers painstakingly put together a movie that really understood the religious aspects and got it right. Absorbing and genuine, `The Nun's Story' makes the movie a must-see mission. <br />
B0001HAISQ|5.0|This is a top notch adaptation of the Peter Pan story. So much more so than the lame Disney version. So much of the script is language right out of the original book and it's beautiful! I felt the characters were perfectly cast and the \\"coming of age\\" aspect of the movie (which seems to turn some off) was handled very gracefully and with much sensitivity. It's so subtle and sweet. And the soundtrack! Love it! This is an excellent movie!
B000MRA5NS|5.0|This is an amazing movie. I recommend to buy this item. Very good picture quality with an LCD tv.
B00005JPAO|1.0|This is probably one of the most boring films I've seen in a long, long time. I can't really think of any redeeming qualities. It's not because it's slow: I will most likely take a slow, foreign film over an American action film anyday. I love them, and they usually affect me in ways that fast-paced movies often cannot. This film is just...empty.  <br /> <br />I went to see this with my whole family (who are mostly British) and we all hated it. So this isn't a case of \\"we don't understand the complexities of the royal family\\" or whatnot. Frankly, there is a lot more they could have done with the royal family, instead of just focusing on this one, boring thing. I just feel like this movie is pretentious, trying to be deep (the scene with the stag...so contrived). I feel like a lot of people I know that say they like this movie are trying to seem sophisticated (not all people, I'm only pointing out those who don't usually like these types of movies and suddenly say this is the best thing ever). Er...I don't mean to offend anyone, I'm just a little bitter that this movie gets so much praise.
0375836675|3.0|Ok, this was a nice book. Interesting (albeit quite unbelievable) premises and a quite readable writing style keep it moving along nicely. I thought about the book every day after I had read parts of it, and looked forward to reading more. BUT then I got to the ending... It's not a BAD ending, just a puzzling and completely improbable ending--one that made me suddenly feel like I had just wasted a bunch of time reading the book. Did the author just get to the end of the book and realize he didn't have an ending, and quickly make something up? Or maybe he actually meant to end it that way. Whatever the case, I don't want to spoil the plot for people, but I'll just say that the identity of someone in question throughout the book turns out to be someone completely out of the blue, and it just doesn't fit the facts and plotline of the book very well.<br /><br />Oh, well. Obviously many people have enjoyed the book, and I did as well, but the tacked-on ending just left me unsatisfied and disgruntled.
B000Q76K24|4.0|After reading a new biography of Robert De Niro,  I was anxious to re-view De Niro 's directorial debut, 'The Good Shepherd'. It is as I had first thought a first rate film. However, for those not entrenched in the 'spy' folklore, it may not be as exciting. Indeed.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, one of the first CIA operatives, and the story is a takeoff of a real person. We meet Edward as the Bay Of Pigs debacle is taking place. We then move back to Edward's time at Yale, his initiation to a secret club for WASPS. This leads him to the secret service life in England during the War. Before he leaves Yale, he meets Angelina Jolie,who he impregnates, marries, leaves fir 6 years while he is secreting in England. They have the child, a boy, who Edward meets when Jr is 6. The marriage is not good, strangers  in the night, so to speak.<br /><br />Edward moves into the CIA at the behest of the big guy who has the ears of Washington. Life becomes work all the time. Not much time for the boy. Russian spies and secrets. This is a fabulous look at the CIA and the secret agent man. The ins and outs, the secrets. Matt Damon is superb as the gaunt, humorless Edward Wilson. All work and no play makes a dull boy.  I wish the film had become a hit, but it is almost three hours long, too dull for most people.  I loved it.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 09-16-14
B000G759LW|5.0|these two cd's are unbelievably amazing! i thought stripped was pretty good, but after coming back with this cd i was blown away. i think christina does an awesome job doing the whole 50's thing and she can definitely pull it off. this cd is pretty much made for any one that likes music from the 50's with a little bit of pop and hip hop added. some of the slow songs on this cd give me chills, and no other artist out there can compete with her voice. her voice is so powerful. i think this cd is so cute, and by this cd you can tell that she is very much in love with her husband, she talks about him in alot of the songs. overall this cd is fabulous and i recommend it to everyone!!
B000N3SS80|5.0|Jennifer Lopez has taken a big important step in her music career and deserves admiration for her efforts. No, she is no Gloria Estefan, but she is original and sounds great. Beautiful effort and great sound throughout the production makes for a great release. Viva Puerto Rico!
B0001XTIUO|5.0|Sometimes the genius of an album can be overhyped by it's obscurity. It is maybe hard to tell if people can be objective or does it even matter when your presented with this stunning set of songs. 'Call of the river' and 'Delicous' are maybe my two favourites but you simply can't go wrong any of the tracks here. Variety is a key ingredient. Listen to 'Moons and Catails' then 'Paralelograms' then 'hey who really cares' this is not simply strummed chords and some stupid lyric. The vocal arrangments are gorgeous as evidenced by the title track (why can't people write intelligent backing vocal anymore. This album is pure sex.
B000NA28I4|2.0|Great actors, great marketing, great special effects. This film is not so bad, but it pretends to be so much more than it is. When we got to the talking dragon I understood why.  <br /> <br />We're spoiled with good children's movies which are fun for the grown ups as well, but this movie is a kid's movie for kids. Would have loved it when i was 12. But then I even loved the \\"Narnia\\" TV-series. Actually, the Narnia movie (2005) was kind of like this one, in my opinion. I didn't like that film either. <br /> <br />Fantasy freaks might enjoy it as well. Maybe it should have had 3 stars, but the story is kind of dull, and I was disappointed.
B000N6U0DS|2.0|I expected a fair amount from this movie, and maybe that's why I felt left down. But I don't really think so. I believe the movie was mediocre at best. To me, the objective of a film is not just about telling sad or funny or any other kind of stories, but more importantly, to create a cinematic experience which the viewer can immerse him / herself in, and come out of feeling altered in some small way at least. This movie completely fails to do that.  <br /> <br />There are a countless sad stories in the world to be told - tales of debilitating poverty, of fatal sicknesses, of sexual abuse, of mass genocide, war tyrannies - the list goes on. But in a film, what matters as much as the story is how the story is told. Movies like \\"Life is Beautiful\\" created magic when they told of suffering. \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" rips the soul out of your body. The Pursuit of Happyness - does nothing. I could barely feel for Chris Gardner (the protagonist), as he went through his motions. The effect on his young son, which I am sure must have been immense, was completely absent. His relationship with his wife is terrible from the start, but somehow lacks the tension it should cause, and becomes all the more forgettable as she walks out of the movie effortlessly. Everything, while looking superficially bad, just feels acceptable because you know it's going to be alright very soon. <br /> <br />To be fair to the movie, the movie does have a few genuine \\"tear drop\\" moments, but those are far and few in between. I think the acting, dialogue, cinematography - everything was just plain mediocre. But above all, I think it was the direction which let the movie down. I believe this movie could have been much better done in the hands of a more able person. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to watch this. If you're just flipping through channels one day and really have little better to do, then go for it. Otherwise, invest your time in something else.
B000MNP2K8|4.0|I was a little disapointed in this movie, but I will attribute it to the change of main character and this representing the begining of James Bond's career.  I eagerly await the next movie, to see if the character will grow into what I am more accustomed to seeing in a Bond movie.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Robin Trower is another \\"over-looked\\" \\"underated\\" guitar of the Rock era. His chord work excellent, his solos melodic. His songs have very catchy rythums and timings. If your ears have been beaten to death by pull-ups and hammer-downs, and a-million-notes-a-minute rock music, Robin Trower will be a welcome relief. Keeping the \\"Soul\\" in rock is a very rare commodity, and Robin does this with rare form. Robins guitar sound is constant, but his application is diverse. This project is a must for any \\"rock-music\\" addict.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a very well thought out product - you get all of the pro features you need in a very small and affordable package. <br /> <br />It's a full TTL flash for Nikon cameras - meaning that the camera will meter the scene and adjust the flash timing and power to match what you are shooting, all automatically. As such, it is very hard to take one of those terrible, washed out flash pictures. <br /> <br />The flash unit itself is mounted so that it can easily be tilted for flash bouncing to give a warmer lighting effect off the ceiling - and the way it is put together means it is still very compact. Very clever. In fact, the unit is so small that it is easy to carry with you just in case you need it. <br /> <br />Finally, you get Nikon quality - build is very good, and it is supplied with a nice padded case. <br /> <br />All of this for little more than the price of a generic flash unit from a camera store!
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|If you are a fan of the movie, then this CD is a must-have!  Surprisingly, Hugh Grant is a very talented singer, and his voice was very well suited to the songs he performed.  I particularly enjoy the song \\"Meaningless Kiss\\", which is reminicent of George Michael's \\"Careless Whisper\\".  \\"Pop Goes my Heart\\" is another favorite, it really captures the sound of 80's pop music.  The songs on the CD were all just as they were performed in the movie, which is not always true of soundtracks.  Overall, very highly recommended!
B00000IQC8|2.0|Clerks has some funny moments, but overall, i felt like it was a bit too long for such a pointless plot (or lack of it). I don't see why this movie is so hyped, i was expecting to get more laughs from it. I dunno, i just didn't find it as hilarious as people make it out to be. It's just an okay, mediocre, decent comedy.
B000E33VWW|2.0|Laughably bad acting. Adam Sandler would have done a better job. Hoffman sounds like he's doing a bad imitation of Sandler's retard voice, or Mr Mackey from South Park. He's talking like he's had half his tongue cut off, and every vocal lilt smacks of laboured premeditation. I haven't heard the actual guy he's playing talk, but I don't need to to know he didn't talk like that.
B000NA28I4|3.0|First of all...I LOVE sword and sorcery fantasy!!! So I was really looking forward to this movie. The name put me off a bit because it was just suspiciously close to the name of the hero from LOTR. Should have followed my gut and rented instead of buying because this is a one time viewing event.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, LOTR set the bar so high for this type of movie that the chances of anything even coming close are zero to none. Remember that what gave LOTR its greatness was the source material. Tolkien was a genius and his meticulous development of a whole realm of existence was amazing. LOTR is (and will probably always be) the gold standard for fantasy, sword, and sorcery. Good acting and special effects can NEVER make up for a weak story. This is the problem with much of Star Wars for example...and most modern films (Fantasy/Sci-Fi) in general. And then there is the whole bugaboo about adapting books to film... <br /> <br />That being said. If you go into this movie not expecting something \\"great\\" but just enjoyable, most \\"young\\" fantasy buffs should enjoy this film. The strengths are the visuals. Unfortunately the weakness is just about everything else (plot...yawn, acting...a whimpy \\"hero\\", predictable villains, sassy dragon, etc.). <br /> <br />The female lead is enchanting and I hope to see more of her in the future. The male lead on the other hand was totally miscast. Even in the film he admits \\"yea you probably expected more\\". Even the black leader of the resistance somehow seemed like a token of political correctness. He seemed very out of place.  <br /> <br />All in all a pretty average film with some nice special effects and cinematography. <br /> <br />BTW..I have not read the book but it did feel like the movie was compressed and rushed. I suspect a lot was left out.

His interpretation of racial identity matures and demystifies as he travels and meets his relatives.  This memoir is a great start for someone who wants to understand the roots of his politics and why they apply to so many people.  An awesome read.

B000MNP2K8|5.0|Forget Connery, Moore, Brosnan and all the others, Daniel Craig has revitalized a long-withering character. Maybe the filmmakers could have come up with a more captivating script, but Daniel's got the magic touch. He's ultra-cool and the whole thing pulls through very well. I wait to see what comes next, but this Mr. Bond is already unrivaled!
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins recently won the Galaxy Author of the <br />Year Award in the UK (and boy, doesn't he deserve it)!  <br />For that reason alone everyone should want to read this  <br />book, but this is also his most important book, one which  <br />should be read by all teachers and politicians. <br /> <br />Every page contains an amusing or shocking anecdote, or a  <br />fascinating fact, or an interesting idea, put forward <br />with great force, clarity and scalpel-like logic. For <br />this reason alone anyone who gives less than four stars <br />is being mean; and as for the one-star reviews, they are <br />being just plain daft, like children throwing their teddy <br />in the corner when they are found-out. <br /> <br />I was aware of several criticisms before I read the book <br />and was interested to see how valid they are, and the <br />answer is not very much at all, in fact the author <br />answers some of those criticisms in the book. <br />Parts that stick in my mind are <br />1. his demolition of the \\"Hitler and Stalin were atheist\\" <br />attack used by critics of atheism, <br />2. the explanation of why anthropic reasoning is an <br />ALTERNATIVE to the god hypothesis and not evidence for it, <br />3. the story of the 6 year old Italian child who was <br />forcibly removed from his jewish parents in 1858 by the <br />papal police after an illiterate catholic babysitter <br />baptised him when she thought his life was in danger, <br />thus making him a Christian who therefore had to be <br />protected from his parents, and <br />4. the account of a conference sponsored by the notorious <br />Templeton Foundation, where he was the token atheist <br />faced with 12 Christians and three agnostics a Jew and a <br />deist. The journalists reporting this event were paid <br />$15,000 plus expenses to attend. Fancy paying the <br />audience to attend! However, Dawkins had his opponents <br />outnumbered; one journalist reported that some of the <br />believers found their faith wavering under Dawkins' <br />dissection of religion! <br /> <br />

B000N6TX1I|3.0|\\"Children of Men\\" does a good job of keeping up the suspense and your curiosity continues to grow wondering what happened to the women across the world as to why they'd suddenly become infertile. Unfortunately, we never find out. That was a big let down. From the beginning of the film, I felt as if I'd missed the first 10 or 15 minutes of the movie to explain why in 2027 things are in such chaos. A little mystery can be good for a story, but not one filled with such obvious political overtones. It just seemed like people were randomly attacking each other for no reason. Yes, I get the fact that there is an underground alliance trying to overthrow Britain's government but the audience doesn't actually \\"witness\\" any reason in the 2 hour film that warrants such drastic actions. It almost comes across like its pro terrorism. Sorry, but the film in the end just left me even more confused. I still give the film 3 stars for Clive Owen because as usual this underrated actor delivers a stellar performance.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|I'm always interested to read about classic films that flopped upon their initial release and only got appreciation years later.  <br /> <br />\\"Man of the West,\\" \\"Vertigo,\\" \\"Seconds\\" ... um ... \\"Office Space\\" and especially in this case, \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Touch of Evil.\\"  <br /> <br />To that list, I believe we'll eventually add \\"Children of Men,\\" which I honestly feel was the absolute best movie of 2006.  <br /> <br />When the end titles flashed up on the screen, I was jolted. I had one of those rare moviegoing experiences where I felt I'd just seen something amazing and awe-inspiring.  <br /> <br />But apparently about half of the people who saw the film completely disagree. After I saw the movie, I wound up in a lot of conversations with people and kept hearing (and, on Amazon, reading) the complaint, \\"Well, we never found out WHY the women in this movie became infertile.\\" And although I understand the curiousity, I was actually proud of the film for not breaking it all down for us. I think we can suspend disbelief, especially given the conditions of the movie's world. And, really, had the movie in one of its many flashes to the television, offered up a \\"Jurassic Park\\"-style primer on the mass infertility, I still don't think the naysayers would've been satisfied.  <br /> <br />Admittedly, for some, \\"Children\\" is a long row to hoe. Writer-director Alfonso Cuaron makes the viewer really work to piece together the plot, and some of the stories questions go completely unanswered, but I'd much rather walk out of a movie still wondering than exit with everything neatly wrapped up. That's why I buy/rent movies on DVD and watch them a second time. <br /> <br />And given the movie's apocalyptic and distopian premise, it would've been completely presumptuous for Cuaron to give viewers any kind of concrete resolution. <br /> <br />But there's so much to like here: The totally plausible background story about Baby Diego; those three amazing extended takes; a really braveand against-type turn by Clive Owen (who, all through the movie, looks like a shirt that's been pulled out of a washing machine and not properly dried -- hey, he picks up the change that the bad guys throw to him, you gotta love that); little touches like the use of Guernica, the Pink Floyd pig and the statue of David with a prosthetic leg; a Ken Russellian shot set to King Crimson; and especially the widwife's explanation of *how* (not why) the infertility began, which is really all the explanation the problem needs.  <br /> <br />It all adds up to a challenging, somewhat mind-boggling movie. I wish more people had liked it as much as I did, but then again it's not really the kind of film that people immediately reach out and embrace. Hey, there are wars going on.  <br /> <br />*** As much as I liked it, I will for balance lodge a few complaints: I hated that awful cover of \\"Ruby Tuesday\\" that got trotted out not once, but twice; I felt Michael Caine's otherwise excellent performance was marred by his excessive use of the word, \\"Amigo\\"; I don't believe a man could disable three vehicles while standing within whispering distance of armed guards; I didn't believe a certain medical procedure that occurs toward the end of the film could be performed as easily as it was under the conditions depicted; and I really wish Cuaron hadn't called the Human Project's boat \\"Tomorrow.\\" But, hey, in the overall picture those problems are minor, especially compared to the wonder of that last six-minute tracking shot, which, as it happens, is the only tracking shot the DVD's extra features *don't* explain. And there again, I'm not sure I really need to know.
B000MM1F5A|5.0|The concert CD is lovely, with Mariza soaring over a band led by Brazilian cellist Jaques Morelenbaum (known for his recent live work with Caetano Veloso...) They work through a variety of fado styles, from the weepiest love songs to giddy folk dances, each style performed with good humor and power.<br /><br />The added bonus documentary film DVD is a real treat, not only for the glimpses of Mariza and other contemporary fado stars, but for its look back at the roots of the genre and its meaning to Portuguese society.  Particularly interesting is its examination of fado's political and social significance -- originally the fado was type of left-wing protest song, but it was subverted in the 1930s by the dictatorship that ruled Portugal until the mid-1970s.  The junta made fado music into a propaganda tool, emphasizing romantic love and family values, to the exclusion of older themes about hard work and hard times.  After the dictatorship toppled, fado fell into disrepute, but regained popularity in the 1980s and '90s when a new generation cast about for a way to guard Portuguese culture from the encroachments of globalized (American) popular entertainment.  A fascinating story, laced with many soulful performances.
B00005JPLU|3.0|Sparta, the first eugenic city-state, is under threat from Xerxes, a pesky Persian who has clearly taken the Village People's advice to \\"go west\\" and seems to have brought the stage set and costume trailers with him. Sparta's King Leonidas is having none of it. The mild Athenians might be willing to fall at Xerxes' feet, but they're a bunch of \\"philosophers and boy-lovers\\", while these Spartan bruisers instead spend their days cavorting about in crimson capes and leather underpants and wrestling with semi-naked 7-year-olds. They're MEN! Xerxes will be repelled or die! But Leonidas can't get his plan past the pox-ridden minders of the nubile oracle, so in the spirit of unelected rulers everywhere (and a few elected ones), he decides to go it alone. His plan is to take 300 soldiers with him and serve it up to Xerxes right down the Thermopylae passage... Based on Frank Miller's lurid comic-book rendering of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. - a scrap that arguably kickstarted the notion of the West - \\"300\\" is another effects-intensive Hollywood spectacle that doesn't quite add up to a great film. What might have been a moving tale of noble sacrifice at the birth of democracy plays more like a self-indulgent visual exercise in balletic fight sequences, digital blood spatter, and the beauty of the male body (for we all know Spartans didn't dress like that). Much has been made of its groundbreaking look, which is admittedly gob-smacking at times, but little else here is new. It plunders lines from \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", \\"Braveheart\\" and \\"Gladiator\\", and when it comes to wringing emotion from the blood-soaked narrative, it simply steals an aesthetic created by Ridley Scott and which is already feeling tired: quasi-Celtic keening, swaying wheat fields, and scenes of familial loss. Still, \\"300\\" looks great, sounds great, gives the sturdy Gerard Butler a real chance to become a star, and certainly delivers some magical moments. And it speaks to an undeniable part of every man, even if it's a part we rarely let off the leash: our love of violence, of the idea of mortal combat, and the adoration of our own wondrous physicality. All of which is quite thrillingly entertaining, and more than enough to compensate for Miller's gross historical inaccuracies and apparent delight in fascism (both way overemphasized by the critics, I think - it's a movie guys, get over it). Ultimately, though, it isn't enough. Much like \\"Sin City\\" before it, \\"300\\" never rises to the next level. It never overcomes its self-consciousness as an exquisite object of beauty for long enough to become moving and meaningful - and thereby manly - in all the ways it should be. The result is a film about real men that is, on reflection, surprisingly effete.man, even if it's a part we rarely let off the leash: our love of violence, of the idea of mortal combat, and the adoration of our own wondrous physicality.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Have watched P and P (Firth/Ehle) probably 10 times, thought it was the best ever.  Bought this because of other reviews mentioning it.  Criticism of Austen for lack of social conscience is clearly reflective of time of writing; this- written a generation later, like most enduring writers of that time (Hugo, Dickens, et al) was loaded with intelligent social comment.  Interesting to observe that at the same time the US was having North/South division, so was the UK (less bloody, thankfully).  The lines were somewhat different and may explain subsequent cultural variances.  In the UK the north was industrial but lower in the class system, not the educated elite; in the US, the north was industrial but was the intellectual and social \\"upper class\\".  Roots of value differences between US and UK are here,  That closing scene of North and South is the most wildly romantic I have ever seen.  The impact is exponentially more emotional and passionate than the graphic sex typical of modern writers and movies.  Beautiful, moving, brilliant.

B0019X3ZZY|1.0|I watch movies for enjoyment.  I don't scour for deep meaning or artistic feelings or any type of artsy fartsy mumbo jumbo.  I heard so much about this movie.  I heard it was truely horrifying, disgusting and blah blah blah....So I finally broke down and purchased it.  It was soooooooo boring.  A group of old German guys goes though a town and takes teenage/young adults to an abandoned mansion..while there...they engage in voyerism, orgies, and ect.  One person eats poop off the floor, more orgies, the captives gather around for story time.  There is even a woman who plays the piano and sings for the groups enjoyment.  In my opinion, her singing was horrible.  I was glad she threw herself out the window.  So the annoying singing, the boring torture, the slow pace of the movie, no dramatic escapes or edge of your seat moments....it took me about three times to watch the movie becaue I kept falling asleep.  I wasn't appauled, horrified, moved....it just made me sleepy.
B00004YTXH|5.0|The inspired melodic vein of Ennio Morricone is simply out of this world.

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|My favorite version of my favorite novel remains the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version because it follows the book, for the most part, in spirit, manners et al.  The acting, in my mind, could not have been better in that version, especially in the casting of those who played the Bennetts senior - Mr and Mrs., Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine De Bourgh and others.  While I very much like Keira Knightley in other things she's done and I think she does well enough capturing the spirit of Lizzie here (and I very much like the actress here who plays her friend, Charlotte Lucas), I think the way the director and screenwriter strove for naturalism in this version made the Bennetts and their house and grounds in particular, as one other reviewer here has described it, too frumpy and dumpy for what one would expect from what Lizzie describes herself as being a 'gentlemen's daughter.'  There is almost a total LACK of gentility and manners in this Bennett clan - forget impropriety - we've gone way overboard.  Keira Knightley's hair, while more 'sexy' looking as modern standards of beauty go, would have been considered quite unkempt and wild when she goes to Bingley's to visit Jane in this version.  Her skirt is '6 inches deep in mud' but otherwise we can assume Lizzie had some idea of the proprieties, otherwise Darcy would not have exempted her and Jane from his condemnation of the rest of the family for not always following social mores/conduct/propriety.  While the scene with Darcy walking across the field with his shirt open is romantic, it's not in the book and seemingly out of character with the Darcy Austen wrote.  I loved Colin Firth's Darcy, and I also loved Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivier's portrayals.  Knightley and MacFayden do ok - I just term this version the Fabio version of the book.

1401307957|3.0|I suppose I had some misperceptions of this book. I was assuming there would be more inspiration that would cajole me into journaling and artwork.

As a disabled person, I thought there would be some insight into overcoming disability to do what you want. I do however, love the way he draws and journals. In the end I saw this as a simple journal that anyone might have done. I still have his other book and I have higher hopes for that.

B000M5AJQI|4.0|I had a love/hate relationship with \\"The Departed\\".<br /><br />I love Martin Scorcese's work. \\"Casino\\" is one of my all time favorites, so I went into \\"The Departed\\" with very high expectations. To be honest, the first hour of the movie was too slow. I understand that Scorcese was establishing his characters and slowly massaging the audience to \\"feel\\" for each character - but it took too much time. I feel like the first hour could have been condensed into 35 minutes without losing any of the \\"flavor\\" for the individual characters and their development.<br /><br />The second half of the movie was the part that won Scorcese the best picture Oscar. It was brilliantly conceived, brilliantly acted and kept you glued to the screen. The second half was the payoff for the painfully slow first hour. Each character seems to come alive and you really get the sense firsthand of the tension and drama as it builds through the second half of the movie.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson was great, as usual, but I really think that Leonardo diCaprio was the star of \\"The Departed\\". He's the guy you latch on to from beginning to bitter end. (By Scorcese's design)<br /><br />All in all, without giving away too many plot points, don't judge this movie by its first half. The second hour of the movie is worth the wait. Scorcese delivers again... although better late than never.<br /><br />4 stars
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie ever since I was a child. I have a copy of it on VHS but the DVD is much better quality and sharper.

B000MRA5NS|5.0|Move over Pierce Brosnan and Timothy Dalton. Daniel Craig is the best Bond in 20 years and has resurrected the franchise that was on life support.<br /><br />The first thing you notice about Casino Royale is that it is absent of all of the cheesy gimmickery of the old Bond movies. The stunts and effects are believable. The acting is understated and real. The plot is fresh and new.<br /><br />Daniel Craig's performance gives a hint of Sean Connery. But it's not an imitation of Connery. Craig makes the role his own. This is a whole new Bond. The cliche is that this movie is Bond for the 21st century (the terrorist angle), when it actually just brings Bond back to his roots. He is cunning more than he is charming. (unlike Roger Moore) He is different, he is new, he reinvents what you think a secret agent in her Majesty's secret service should be.<br /><br />If you are looking for the trademark Bond staples such as the Martini (shaken, not stirred) - the easy women, the endless supply of Aston Martins etc... this movie may disappoint. Craig is rough around the edges but just smooth enough to make you believe that he deserves to be the newest \\"double-oh\\".<br /><br />I suggest buying this DVD in 1080p Blu-Ray because of the spectacular cinematography, shot on location in Prague. It won't disappoint.<br /><br />The best part about the movie, without giving too much away, is that the ending leaves you wanting more. Isn't that the goal of any great series?<br /><br />I give it 5 stars.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|There aren't too many movies that I get really excited about, but this one is exceptional.  It's so beautifully made; it's touching, but not so melodramatic that it's gushing; you really get to feel everything the lead character is feeling.  I was pulling for him, and wanted him to survive and prosper.  It's so inspirational, and the music is incredibly perfect.  The only thing I can criticize is that \\"Bridge over troubled Water\\" was waaaaaayyyyy too short; it was so beautiful.  Everything else about this movie is perfect, especially Will Smith.  Wow!

B000J10ERO|1.0|I'm shocked that having spent, (what was it?) $200 Million, they couldn't have at least employeed a writer/director who cared about the original medium, Comics, and that pre-existing fanbase. <br />I wouldn't be complaining, but to base it off of the original films, and then ignore so many gems that made the original films enjoyable, simply left a lot to be desired. <br />I feel looking back, that the writers simply wanted to reach non-fans by writing a 'cutting-edge' 'non-traditional' Superman story. It wasn't necessary. <br /> <br />Lastly, while I love Lex Luthor, I found it a shame they chose to keep the Version of Lex who is a Real-Estate Obsessed Super-Villian, who lacks forethought. <br /> <br />I'm beginning to think the heads of WB don't know of any other villians for Supes to fight. <br /> <br />Most shocking is that they signed the writer's up for a trilogy deal, before this movie even hit theaters.
B000EZ7ZZE|4.0|Its an average blu-ray, but I love the movie itself. I guess I am a Milla fan.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|I really can't believe this won an Oscar for Best Picture. Personally, I didn't think it was that good. Maybe I'm missing something, or, maybe I just like being entertained more, or, maybe I'm  not a fan of a movie where everybody dies. The acting was good. I LOVE the actors in this movie. Maybe because of the all star cast (including Martin as director) was a big reason it won.
B000ICLRJ8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and think it should be part of everyone's collection. It kept my attention and did not get boring.
0060254920|5.0|This has got to be one of the greatest children's books of all time, being brilliantly written and illustrated and more than worthy of every award and rave review it has gotten over the years. Sendak's simple words are precisely chosen and deliver stirring impetus to spark any child's imagination. Though the wonderful artwork helps the story along, it is produced in such a way as to enhance rather than replace the child's creative thoughts. The stream-of-coonsciousness dreamlike quality of sentences that carry on over several pages invoke a dream-like experience for the child, and just might make the work the first ever example of modernist children's literature. What's more, the parent will enjoy it too and it leaves the child with a positive outlook about home. Not to mention that it really does settle children down and get them ready for sleep!<br /><br />J. Lyon Layden<br />The Other Side of Yore
B000A88EVE|5.0|I saw this movie years ago on VHS. This is the ultimate for collectors.<br /><br />Lots of extra goodies ala Criterion. Beatifully remastered. I have a couple other Roeg films released by Criterion, and again Criterion has come through with a quality product. If you've seen this film and liked it<br /><br />than this is a must have. When I rented this on VHS, it was an unrated version, but this one has had some additional footage added. Charlie S.
1878424319|5.0|This is such a wonderful book for anyone of any spiritual tradition.  I always say that \\"Truth simply is\\" and this book is Truth, plain and simple.  It is so easy to read and clear to understand....if practiced, it can really make an impact on your life.  I really like the first chapter as it explains how people get stuck in agreements that bind them to judgment, fear, guilt, belief systems, etc.  This is such a helpful book for those looking for true Truth.
B000BBOUU4|1.0|I feel like I should say something about this movie even though I care very little about wether people liked it or not, i just don't understand how people should like this movie or even let their children watch it. Willy wonka was clearly a psycopath in this movie, purpousefully trying to get the children harmed in some way or other, I would even prefer my kids to watch sleepy hollow than this crap, at least it was not about some crazy man wishing to kill kids (though they twisted it at the end showing the kids so people would not think they got killed). Also the kids in the movie were not even spoiled but pure evil themselves, except for charlie which was sooo poor and good that almost made me want to throw up. I for once prefer the other movie, even though it's a little bit silly.  <br /> <br />They came up with this whole deal with willy wonka's father being a dentist which had no repercussions whatsoever to the story line, they could have cut out that part completely and in the end it would have been the same ending, but less stupid. Chop off a man's arms and replace it with chicken wings and that's exactly what you'll get in this movie. I am ashamed that they came up with this bad remake, i like jhonny depp and tim burton, but this is a no go. I think giving it one star is too much.
0060557818|1.0|Besides of all the annoying parts, and there are plenty, this book goes nowhere and gives you nothing.<br />It is just a very, very light read, and it seems to be written without any passion and respect neither for the book itself nor for the reader.<br />I cannot see a dramaturgy at all, and dramaturgy is the least bit I should expect from a book.<br />The whole story is like a lot of weak ideas just poorly linked together. It gives me the impression that the author is not able to create a story with inner logic, suspense and dramatic peaks.<br />For example the fight between Hunter and the beast:<br />It was announced for chapters and then it was over in just a few seconds.<br />Another example is \\"Richard's Ordeal\\":<br />What could have been a key sequence in the book, what should have been Richards catharsis, was just a mediocre nightmare from which Gaiman steals himself away without any solution.<br />Then there is the moment we all learn who is the villain. It couldn't have been more crude, could it?<br />And is there really a true conflict in Richard regarding his real life and his girlfriend? For me it rather looks like he just wants to slip into this underworld for good out of reasons a kid in real life would slip into the world of video games.<br />The one star is for the sometimes funny murderer duo.
B000A6T262|5.0|I've waited a long time to buy this complete set, thinking I know each movie by memory, why should I have to pay for them? Well, after purchasing it, I can say that what I remember is no way near what is contained in this 10-movie DVD set. Watching each movie triggers a pleasant memory from my life, and I don't know why I waited this long to re-affirm my love for something as close to kin as Star Trek. You've waited long enough. You deserve it, too!
B000MVQ9P2|3.0|It isn't the typical hollywood horror film and thats what I liked about it.  <br />WHY YOU SHOULD SEE IT.  <br />* There is real character development. You may not like them but there is development.  <br />* The team of heros don't all survive.  <br />* The team of heros don't really like one another that well.  Dysfunction is fun. <br />* The heros get widly separated and belieably brought back into the key moment.  <br />* The victim the heros are after has a compelling little story in the beasts lair. <br />* The wide angle running escape scene after the brain tap was fun to watch. I reminded me of a fight scene in Old Boy. <br />* Its probably better to watch it on DVD because as you will see below I assume the Korean version had a few extra scenes.  <br />* This director has a weird eye and is coming from a different angle and after making Old Boy and a less wonderful but solid Sympathy for Mr. Vengence you gotta give him credit for trying something totally different. <br /> <br />WHY YOU MAY NOT LOVE IT. <br />A) There are scenes that don't make sense: The pouring out of the formaldhyde for failing to dust a military morgue somehow leads to a mutation a few years later but there is no scene of direct linkage just arbitrary blame.  You also don't know why the doctor is such a good as to dump probably a hundred gallons of formaldhyde down the sink just cause there is dust on it. In addition there appears to be a missing scene between the brother getting hit in the head with a bottle by one character and then suddenly being in a car with that character and a man in surgical scrubs while making molotov coctails in the back seat.  They also never develop that guy who hits him with the bottle and all of a sudden he is helping make coctails, and later pouring gas on something at a crucial moment. <br />B) Several very anti american scenes and oddly subservient doctors, politicians and military Koreans.  Lots of radio and TV broadcasts about the Americans and WHO andother organizations criticizing Korea for its failure to capture the \\"virus\\" carriers and governmental acquiescence to let them come in and do something.  <br />C) The cheesy end scene where a weirdly shaped egg like thing on a crane is going to drop agent yellow to kill all viruses in the area. One crane was going to drop some yellow smoke that would cover the area for 12 kilometers around.  It made no sense.
B000EQH2QK|5.0|I would be shocked if you didn't feel the urge to dance and sing.  Only ever heard \\"Hips don't lie\\" before buying this.  Glad I did.  Love the whole thing.  She has a big full voice that makes you want to sing.
037571457X|5.0|This is a work of genius.  In a series of strung together episodes, this graphic piece constitutes a sort of autobiography of growing up Iranian.  The author/artist was born in 1969.  Following the Islamic Revolution and the Iran-Iraq War she was sent by her parents to school in Austria.  In Iran for at least part of the time she attended a French school.   <br /> <br />The account of an Iranian upbringing is political and funny.  Childhood and young adulthood consisted of the the usual fascination with clothes and fads and with the absurd stances of significant adults.  Iranian tragedy is made palatable to the prospective reader by the use of the graphic format.
B000000HU0|4.0|This 1975 album found the band without founding member Daevid Allen and exploring the mallet heavy jazz rock that characterized the Pierre Moerlen fronted version of the band.  Although some folks do not like this album too much, I actually think that musically it is in pretty good form.  Come to think of it, the tunes consist of a nice mixture of the spacey, heavy prog of 1971-1974 and the jazz rock of 1976-1977.  Nick Mason (Pink Floyd drummer) produced the album and it sounds excellent.<br /><br />The lineup at this point included a few holdovers from the Daevid Allen era Gong and some new members including: Mike Howlett (bass guitar, vocals); Didier \\"Bloom\\" Malherbe (Tenor and soprano saxophones, C and G flutes, bamboo flutes, and gongs); the superb Pierre Moerlen (drums, vibraphone, tubular bells); Miquette Giraudy (vocals on Bambooji); Mireille Bauer (marimba, glockenspiel, xylophone, assorted percussion and gongs); Steve Hillage (acoustic and electric guitars on Bambooji and Wingful of Eyes only); and Patrice Lemoine (electric and acoustic piano, mini moog synthesizer, and Hammond organ).  Patrice was an active member of the French prog scene and played with members of the great French band Atoll and the band Arc amongst others.  Although Patrice is a great player, I really miss the spacey synthesizers of Tim Blake.  All of the musicians from the Shamal lineup are excellent and it was clear that although a major upheaval in personnel had occurred, the playing did not suffer one bit.<br /><br />The six tracks on the album range in length from 3'03\\" to 9'54\\" and consist of a mixture of tunes with vocals and instrumentals. Unfortunately, I really do not think vocals were Mike's strong suit although they do not bother me too much.  Although there are a few moments that hearken back to the heavy space prog of albums like You (1974) and Angels Egg (1973), this album contains a lot of instrumentals with jazz rock overtones.  In fact, the musical direction had changed quite a bit - the emphasis had shifted to from trippy \\"Pot-head Pixies\\", \\"Octave Doctors\\" and the like to virtuosic jazz rock.  This is however, extremely interesting and \\"weird\\" sounding jazz rock and is not to be confused with the music of Mahavishnu Orchestra or Return to Forever.  The music of Gong was still quite distinctive even during this transitional period.<br /><br />All in all this is a good album that shows the band moving in the direction of full blown jazz rock that they would adopt on albums like Gazeuse (1976) and Expresso II (1977).  However, there are shades of the Daevid Allen period of Gong here and there, which makes this a pretty enjoyable listen.- the emphasis had shifted to from trippy \\"Pot-head Pixies\\", \\"Octave Doctors\\" and the like to virtuosic jazz rock.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|Why else do you think writers write?  Probably one of the ultimate dreams is having their worlds come to life. The theme's been addressed in book, song, and film. First time I encountered this phenomena was \\"Typewriter\\" by L. Ron Hubbard, a story where the protagonist did his best to take over the story.  \\"Where Failure Goes\\" is a 70's song by Rupert Holmes which talks about where the characters from his failed songs ended up.  \\"Stranger than Fiction,\\" carries on that theme.   <br /> <br />Harold Crick (Ferrell) is an IRS agent, who lives by the numbers, from counting how many times he brushes each of his thirty-two teeth twice a day, to how many seconds he saves tying a single Windsor knot instead of a double each day (43, according to his watch, which bears silent witness to Crick's life every day and personally thinks the double would look better on him).  When Crick starts to hear voices, he contacts a shrink, who tells him he's schizophrenic.  Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffmann) a notable expert on literature has a different take on Crick's experience based on four words he can remember... <br /> <br />\\"Little did he know...\\"   <br /> <br />Since this is third-person omniscient, Crick may well be the character in a novel and the narrator he's hearing is a novelist. The prof designs a 23 question survey to determine who is writing the story. Crick only has a matter of time, because the narrator has revealed to him that he's going to die.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) can't seem to finish her contractual obligations.  She's sent an aide from the publisher (Queen Latifah) who works to break the logjam of her writer's block so she can kill her character and get the book published.   <br /> <br />The result is a funny, very revealing look at writers and the way they write and think.  This movie took a bit for me to warm up to.  In my opinion, the front portion of the film is somewhat slow to set up and grab your attention, but once it does, you want to know what's going to happen to both Crick and Eiffel.  This is definitely worth a watch if you are a writer, enjoy the process, or just like something really different once in a while.
B00004Z459|5.0|I didn't buy this CD when it first came out. I went to basic military training and my brother bought this CD for me as a gift. I did not usually listen to rock but mostly R&B at the time so I thought I wouldn't like it. But I had to live in the dorms while I did some more trainng and my roommate would always talk on the phone at 3 in the morning so I would play this CD in my CD player with the headphones on to get me to sleep. It got to the point where I would play it every night regardless if my roommate was on the phone or not. Every song on here is classic and I love how it flows. I think that LP was the first in coming out with this new sound and I think that they set the bar for all other groups out there. I love their creativity and I have every single one of their CDs. Even the remakes. Yes, I am an avid fan. I just hate how they take so long to come out with a new CD. I am always craving more when I hear a new LP CD. All in all, if you are not wanting to hear the mainstream types of music they play on MTV over and over, try this CD. Its awesome!
B000059Z8J|5.0|I don't know why it took me so long to buy this film. I picked it up at the video store last week, brought it home, and I've been watching it every day since then! I first saw the film in 1978, when everyone was excited about seeing a film about the mythical superhero (before we all became jaded by endless superhero films). I remember being surprised by Margot Kidder's performance as Lois Lane; I was a child then, and I had always thought that Lois was supposed to be a very passive character, not an assertive, hard-working woman. Kidder changed that for me. <br /> <br />This film, regardless of the input of many talented artists, will always and indelibly belong to the late Christopher Reeve. It makes my heart ache to see him, young, strong, beautiful, and able-bodied. I had forgotten how good he really was; he's so good, you can easily miss the little subtleties he brings to his characterization. It was his first starring role, and he holds his own effortlessly even against such heavyweights as Brando and Hackman. He manages to be believably self-effacing and klutzy as Clark Kent, and believably strong and moral as Superman - NOT an easy task, by any means. <br /> <br />I believed that he would walk again, after his tragic accident. Then we suffered the bitter, heartbreaking loss first of Christopher Reeve, then of his incredibly strong wife, Dana. Now, THAT is a story worth telling. <br /> <br />This is the single best casting job ever performed in Hollywood, and nobody knew, at the time, how perfect or compelling it would be. Reeve had less than two decades of able-bodied life ahead of him; he would be gone from us before thirty years had passed. He didn't just play the part of Superman; he WAS Superman, with a strength, courage, and determination that even the Man of Steel didn't possess. <br /> <br />You are sorely missed, Mr. Reeve/Superman.
0307276902|4.0|I read this book right when Oprah introduced it a couple of years ago. I found it intriguing because coincidentally my older brother was entering a year long stint of drug rehab at the same time. It was insightful as a caring family member to be able to see inside of a former drug addicts mind. Even though we know he didn't tell the whole truth in parts of the book, I found it very insightful and it truly didn't matter to me whether all of it was the complete truth or not. It was a story that one person wrote that had some truth to it and that story helped me get through that hard part of my life with my brother. It made me be more empathetic towards him. So while he is getting a lot of critcism for the book and his truthfulness, I would still recommend this raw account of one person's struggle with addiction.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|While I didn't go quite as nuts for the Arcade Fire's debut Funeral as some did, there was little question that it was a powerful, emotive offering that established the band (or collective, whatever) as a unique presence in an indie rock world too often glutted with knockoffs.  That album's everything-but-the-kitchen sink approach, highlighted by driving rhythms, mammoth swells of orchestration, and of course the frequently wild wail of vocalist Win Butler all added up to musical anomaly that was lumped into the \\"indie\\" category mainly because it didn't fit any other ones.  Sure, there were a few less-inspired tracks, as well as a couple that bordered on wussy, but the potential shown on Funeral was obvious, and it's a potential that's very much fulfilled on the band's second full-length, this year's Neon Bible.  With Butler soundly signicantly more assured this time out, Neon Bible serves up a string of transcendent cacaphonies and plantive meditations, all of them at least good and several brilliant.<br /><br />Right from the start, with the opening sonic headrush of the propulsive Black Mirror and the righteous, swinging Keep the Car Running, it's apparent that Neon Bible is only going to up the ante on its predecessor in terms of both ambition and focus.  Funeral was highly notable for the way it managed to combine so many disparate influences and so much seemingly mutually exclusive instrumentation, and while Neon Bible certainly continues in that vein it's impossible not to notice how much the band has refined its songwriting, to say nothing of the way the album's rawer, more cavernous production enhances its already considerable emotional directness.  Some songs build inexorably toward their big payoffs, while on others it comes seemingly out of nowhere, but the band shows a remarkable aptitude at making you wait for it.  Just check out the accordian-backed Intervention, which steadily moves from a minimal beginning to an all-out, head-banging climax, with a succession of additional instruments joining the fray along the way in a manner that would make Godspeed You!Black Emperor proud; or The Well and the Lighthouse, which inverts Intervention's approach by racing out of the blocks at top speed before capsizing into a slower, harder-hitting version of its own first half.  The title track is a hushed, almost childlike meditation, while the Rambling, user-friendly anthem (Antichrist Television Blues) makes Butler's repeated proclamations of \\"I don't wanna work in a building downtown\\" into a Springsteen-esque mantra.<br /><br />So, to conclude: I like this album.  If you liked the first one, you should like this one too, probably more.  In what's been a good year for music so far, with several excellent new releases, Neon Bible should still end up standing out.h a succession of additional instruments joining the fray along the way in a manner that would make Godspeed You!Black Emperor proud; or The Well and the Lighthouse, which inverts Intervention's approach by racing out of the blocks at top speed before capsizing into a slower, harder-hitting version of its own first half.

032147404X|5.0|The format is superb. The writing is succinct and funny and the content is spot on (tact sharp). I read the amazon.com reviews and decided if this book was anywhere close to as good as peole said it was, I had to have it immediately. I paid alot more at my local store, but it was worth it to get it the same night. I have since purchased another copy of it to send to an experienced photographer friend. No matter how experienced or inexperienced you are with photography you are guaranteed to find useful tips because of the wide range of topics (wedding, sports, travel), this book will pay for itself in savings on equipment and potentially costly mistakes. It's a fun read written in a style so funny you will laugh out loud, handy reference and inspiration. One caution: If you do not own a SLR, reading this book will probably end up costing you at least $500 to upgrade, but you will be happy you did. Enjoy!
B000MNP2KI|1.0|Let me start by saying that I love the \\"James Bond\\" movies in general.  I have read all of the books by Ian Flemming and seen all of the movies more than once. <br /> <br />Now to the movie. <br /> <br />It is quite possibly one of the WORST movies I have ever seen.  The story doesn't have an \\"arch enemy\\" to begin with.  We have to sit through a 10-minute foot race over roof tops and through back alleys (the stunts are fantastic though) that left me wondering who was being chased and why are they important at all?!   <br /> <br />The movie slows down to about 30 minutes of watching some of the actor's play poker.  Who cares about paying money to watch a poker game in a movie!!!!!  If I want to watch poker I will watch Texas Hold 'Em tournaments on TV for FREE!!!! <br /> <br />There were at LEAST three points in the movie (possibly) more that the story could have ended gracefully.  Yet we have to watch this movie continue to CRAWL, LIMP and gasp and wheeze for another 45 minutes to the end. <br /> <br />PLEASE just stop the movie and avoid the agony of watching this to the end.
B00002DE0S|5.0|Mr. Zimerman and his Polish Festival Orchestra have produced a very fine recording of the Chopin Piano Concertos No. 1 and 2.  Mr. Zimerman has hand picked young Polish musicians to form this orchestra. While it is quite possible for the musicians who are not Polish to completely succeed in interpreting Chopin, I think that it does help if one absorbs Chopin with the mother's milk, so to speak. Mr. Zimerman plays piano and also conducts. He lets the orchestra flourish.  They produce a big wave of intricate music.  One can hear that the musicians in the orchestra are pouring their hearts and creativity out.  One can feel the freedom of the orchestral expression.  The orchestra follows the gentleness and the lyricism of Mr. Zimerman's interpretation.  <br /> <br />Mr. Zimerman will immediately touch your heart.  He is a great master of Chopin.  <br /> <br />Mr. Zimerman plays beautifully, with delicate soft dynamics. He achieves the full emotional effect without any over-expressions.  He goes softer and more delicate in many places in which others may add more sound and strength.  His effect wins. <br /> <br />My favorites are the Rondo from the Concerto No.1, in which Mr. Zimerman plays energetically and with determination, but without any harshness of tone, and the Maestoso from the Concerto No. 2.  In the latter the orchestra initially goes for less sound, rather than for the bigger sound often heard in other orchestras.  There is a vein of Chopin's sadness that would be lost if the orchestra were too bright.  The piano enters dramatically, but then becomes whimsical, and later quite sad. More moods follow. This is the most beautiful movement. After the great introduction and the middle part the momentum is lost.  It is regained towards the end of the movement, but one could feel the recovery.  I guess there is a trade-off when one uses the tempo changes as a way to express subtle points in music. The loss of the musical momentum could be possibly looked at positively, as a stopping point for the reflection, but I did not like it.  Here is where the stick of an external conductor would be welcome. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great recording, characterized by finesse, tenderness, lyricism, and gentleness, and a nice capture of the dramatic moments. It is Chopin at its best.  <br />
B0000640SA|1.0|unfortunately, i suffer the same condition as guy pearce's character, so i kept forgetting what the heck was going on.  but that's probably the case for anyone with this movie.  the only scene worth watching is when dodd goes to take a leak, not knowing that leonard is in his shower (leonard probably clueless about where he is or what he is supposed to be doing).  leonard jumps out stark naked (surprising dodd, who i believe at that point has no idea who leonard is), beats the daylights out of dodd, ties him up, throws him in a closet, and snaps a polaroid.  that scene on its own deserves an emmy.  the rest is garbage and a total waste of time.
6305064679|5.0|An excellent movie, The Full Monty, brings to the screen the story of six unemployed men living in an economically depressed region of England, who in an effort to make ends meet decide to put up a male striptease act...   <br />Robert Carlyle, Mark Addy, Tom Wilkinson and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the HUMOR and the MUSIC are all wonderful! <br />In short, The Full Monty is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! <br />
B0001KZM3O|4.0|This is not a \\"typical\\" Pink Floyd album, it has accurately been called a Rodger Waters solo project. Waters wrote the material as a follow up to The Wall, the final cut so to speak. Lyrically more critial of politics and society than previous, and focused on the death of his father in the war. It is a concept album that features some of Pink Floyd's most ambitous special effects with the use of hollophonics, that give a 3D effect. The missle zomming by and exploding in \\"Get Your Filthy Hands Off my Desert\\" and the car zooming past at the begining of \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" are excellent examples. <br /> <br />Musically it is very theatrical. Many songs are performed with an orchestra or a string quartets instead of the band itself. David Gilmour appears very little but when he does, he shines brightly. Rick Wright and the synthesizers are not part of this album. Replaced with organ and piano and orchestra. This album furthers the departure from the \\"Pink Floyd Sound\\" of classic albums like Dark Side of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, and Animals and heads more towards the sound of The Wall. Which isn't really a bad thing here. Artistically it works wonderfully. Roger Waters provides some his most emotional and heartfelt lyrics and singing to brilliant pieces of music. But is it Pink Floyd? The band was falling apart while this album was being made and perhaps it could have been Roger Waters solo album. But it sounds too much like Pink Floyd for that. The production is more focused on detail and there is less \\"bombast\\" than The Wall. The songs are well written both musically and lyrically, proving Roger Waters was the heart of Pink Floyd. But Gilmour and crew were able to play the material with the proper spirit. <br /> <br />All in all, this is one of those really good albums the was critally hailed, but met with weak sales. The Final Cut is probably not for the new fan, you're better off starting with one of the classics mentioned above and venture forward or backwards from there. But I feel it was inexplicably ignored or critized as not up to par. To those I say, give it another listen.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000NA28I4|3.0|Eragon was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Robert Carlyle, and Djimon Hounsou among others, though by no means is it a bad movie. <br />A young farm boy comes across a strange stone that holds the key to the past, the present, and the future... <br />In short, the acting is pretty good (but really nothing great), the dialogues are weak, the plot is average, the setting is good, while the special effects are very good.  <br />On the negative side: <br />1) The unoriginal story/plot, which is heavily \\"borrowed\\" from LoR, Star Wars and the Dragonlance Chronicles by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis (all three being AMAZING btw...)  <br />2) The rather poor choice for the lead actor. <br />3) Jeremy Irons and Robert Carlyle being given poor lines and majorly cliche roles to play. <br />4) Djimon Hounsou looking completely out of place in this film. <br />5) John Malkovich counting 2-3 minutes of actual play.   <br />On the positive side: <br />1) The Fantasy setting <br />2) The very good special effects; Saphira was great! <br />3) Sienna Guillory (!) who definitely has potential.  <br />So it's an average plot, weak dialogues, decent acting, an interesting setting, respectable music (though it could have been better), and a good cast, which when put together fail to take off.  The potential for a great movie was definitely there and although it's far from being a masterpiece, it will provide for an evening's entertainment. <br />
1592402690|5.0|HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE: MY LIFE RECORDING THE MUSIC OF THE BEATLES comes from Grammy winner and recording industry legend Geoff Emerick, who provides behind-the-scenes insights related to the years he spent at EMI Studios at Abbey Road working with the band on some of their key albums. He was their main recording engineer for Revolver, and his work with the band lends important insights into their collaborative efforts and personalities perfect for Beatles fans - even those who already have many books on the group and its members.
B000J103PC|5.0|Meryl Streep was absolutely astounding in this movie.  I'm not a fashionista or even pretend to understand the whoopla surrounding that world.  However, TDWP is a character study movie that entertains and spins out some life lessons.  I do agree with Andrea's take.  If Miranda was a man no one would have said jack about his impossible demands or even blink of what is sacrificed for the sake of success in the business world.  Andrea's ugly ducking transformation is but a small part of the movie.  And frankly if she thinks the rules are any different in the world of hard hitting journalism then she's in for another eye opening experience.  Tucci was also equally impressive in his performance.  But over all I think the screenwriters and the director did a remarkable job on such mediocre \\"best selling\\" book.  I love how in the special features section the trip to the big screen that they all but admitted that the book was just one dimensional.  Over all.  Great movie.
B000002GBK|4.0|This album sounds very contemporary. Great vocal, diverse and higly dramatic musical themes - you will listen it again and again!  <br /> <br />The only serious drawback - mediocre quality of recording.
B000FA57N0|5.0|Love this movie.  Would recommend watching the series too, but it's not a must.  In fact, I saw Serenity first, and since I enjoyed the movie so much, I decided to rent the series.  Really enjoyed it.  Highly recommended.
B000002JR8|5.0|Although I do not have The Great Southern Trendkill, I own every other Pantera release and can say without a doubt that this is their heaviest, hardest, most extreme album to date. It is pure metal mayhem, sheer madness. The only slow songs that we see on here are Good Friends and a Bottle Of Pills and the Black Sabbath cover- Planet Caravan. Good Friends is the only mediocre track and in my opinion is pretty unnecessary, yet pretty humorous. It's really hard to pick and choose favorites. I'd have to say that I'm Broken, Slaughtered, and Use My Third Arm are the best tracks. Slaughtered is incredibly heavy and catchy as hell, but it's Use My Third Arm that is really insane and sounds like it could be death metal at some times. I'm Broken has a nice, dirty, southern style riff that will no doubt be stuck in your head. Of course, the fan favorite-5 Minutes Alone is one of the other great tracks on which Phil's vocals are the real standout.<br /><br />The whole band sounds excellent on here. Phil stays mainly to a low, heavy growl, but at a few points demonstrates his unique singing voice. He does some death metal screams which are also awesome. Dimebag is of course in grade-A form here and has some very complex riffs and trademark solos. Vinnie is in top notch form on the drums and his double bass is heard throughout and he even brings the ole' cowbell out for some parts. Rex \\"Rocker\\" Brown also does a superb job, and although Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills is the worst song, it does have a real cool bass line throughout and he puts down some sweet riffs during Dimebag's solos. Also, the cover that you see on the cd is not the original. They had a different one, but it was to explicit for the record company's likings so they changed it to this.<br /><br />This is a must have, classic 90s album. This is their heaviest album and is also complex. It will definitely keep you occupied listening for all the time changes and different riffs. So if you want something heavy and different and you love thrash metal, go for Far Beyond Driven.and you love thrash metal, go for Far Beyond Driven.
B00000J2PH|5.0|this is a great cd and it arrived in a very timely manner I am very happy with the service I have recieved through amazon
B0000AUHPK|5.0|It's a great pairing of actors, moody, gloomy, romantic, it's everything it should be.
B000I5X81A|5.0|Eric Clapton has made it thru much in the past 40 years: drugs and alcohol, personal tragedy, and horrible 80's synthesizers. This CD is just plain good-it doesn't try to be something it's not, and Clapton doesn't have to prove he's a guitar god anymore. J.J. Cale writes some good bluesy rock songs and together they sound great. The addition of Dereck Trucks on slide guitar is terrific, as is Billy Preston on the organ. This recording is not \\"slick\\" or \\"overproduced\\" as some have said-it sounds smooth, clear and accurate. I have a feeling that this CD will receive regular playing time on my stereo for many, many years.
B000002H33|5.0|this is metallica like they should be. brutal, fast, well thought out lyrics, and killer riffs through and through. this album is why metallica were considered metal gods. (i say were due to the fact that the last few albums they came out with have severly soured there reputation). arguably metallicas best album ever, and possibly one of the best metal albums period. i do feel that metallica is somewhat a product of the american hype machine, but to be fair this album here deserves all the hype that it gets. cliff burton was a magnificant musician and will be sorely missed. i highly doubt the tragedy that was load, reload and st anger would have ever came to light if he was still here today. <br /> <br />all the tracks on this album are all classics, but my favorite are orion (one of the best metal instrumentals ever) the title track and damage inc.  <br /> <br />If for some reason you have lived under a rock for the last 100 years and have never heard metallica before, this is by far the one album you need to start with. actually if you are trapped on an island and can only take 10 cds with you this should be one of them.
0061120081|5.0|There used to be a time that the word \\"classic\\" meant something.  Nowadays, it seems to only mean \\"more than ten years old\\"; quality doesn't come into the equation at all.  Take, for example, the cable channel American Movie Classics, which typically features movies that are forgettable regardless of age.  I prefer the classic definition of \\"classic\\", one that means something that is not only really good but withstands the test of time. <br /> <br />Put another way, look at the Da Vinci Code.  A decent book and a phenomenal best-seller, but will people still be reading it decades from now?  Only time will tell.  Time, however, has already told on Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, and it is clearly, by any use of the word, a classic.  Although forty-seven years old, it is still as good as ever. <br /> <br />Set in the town of Maycomb, Alabama during the Depression, To Kill a Mockingbird tells the tale of the Finch family:  widower father Atticus, young son Jem and younger daughter (and narrator) Scout.  Atticus, an attorney, has been appointed to represent Tom Robinson, accused of raping a 19-year-old girl named Mayall Ewell.  Since Tom is black and Mayall is white, guilt is assumed by most of the town and the trial a mere formality.  The truth plays little part. <br /> <br />Maycomb is a stratified society.  There are the \\"respectable\\" people, who - with or without money - are considered the aristocrats of the community.  The Finches fit into this category.  There are the poorer white people, from the poor-yet-proud Cunninghams to the \\"trashy\\" Ewells.  At the bottom are the blacks.  Though Atticus refuses to participate in this classism (and tries to lead his children to do the same), he is pragmatic enough to acknowledge its existence. <br /> <br />This novel may have the trial of Tom Robinson as its centerpiece, but there is plenty more going on as we take a tour of an impoverished town in the Deep South.  With this book, Lee has written one of the Great American Novels.  And while some great authors are not easily readable (for example, Faulkner), Harper Lee holds the reader from the beginning to end.   <br /> <br />Has there been any author who has written something so great in his or her only effort?  Yes, there are authors like Margaret Mitchell who wrote Gone With the Wind (which has a far more romantic version of the Old South), but her career was cut short by an early death; Lee is still around and still has no other books published.  The one book she wrote, however, is considered one of the greatest novels ever written.  It is a true classic. <br />
B00005JPOE|5.0|There is not much I can add to the previous review as far as importance and story.  A period costume piece this film most certainly is not: it's a timeless story of the triumph of good, determination, and perseverance, and a very human telling. Well-written, beautifully scored, finely acted and gorgeously filmed, \\"Amazing Grace\\" is a treat for the eyes as well as a balm and inspiration for the heart.  I must give kudos to the excellent makeup team - they've done an exceptional job with the entire cast, particularly Ioan Gruffudd (Wilberforce) and Benedict Cumberbatch (William Pitt), both of whom portray men often battling illness and addiction throughout the film.  As a former makeup artist I am very impressed with their work, especially with regards to ageing the characters. <br /> <br />The cinematography is beautiful and lush as well, rich with texture and very fine small touches.  The colour is gorgeous.  Some of the images will stay in my mind for some time!  The score - which I purchased immediately after seeing the film the first time - is beautiful and organic.   <br /> <br />Finally, the cast is absolutely perfect.  Gruffudd as Wilberforce turns in a wonderful performance, portraying a man driven by his dream and hope for a better world.   Benedict Cumberbatch, as yet unknown on this side of the pond, was particularly excellent and absolutely sublime as Wilberforce's best friend and PM William Pitt the Younger.  His acting and carriage is quite impressive, and if he chooses his scripts wisely, he's likely to have a golden career.  The beautiful Romola Garai plays the intrigued-by-Wilberforce and abolitionist Barbara Spooner; her character wanting to hear Wilberforce's story is our vehicle for hearing the backstory as well as encouraging Wilberforce to continue his work.  Albert Finney convincingly and honestly plays a minor role as John Newton, composer of the great hymn \\"Amazing Grace\\".   Finney has a few of the film's best lines.  Michael Gambon does a sound and often entertaining turn as Lord Charles Fox (in general Pitt's fierce enemy but aligning himself with Wilberforce anyhow); Ciaran Hinds is perfect as Lord Tarleton (really, he is).   Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour plays the former slave Olaudah Equiano, a prominent abolitionist; I found myself wishing he'd had more screen time and opportunity to flesh out his role.  As Equiano, his screen presence is quite powerful. <br /> <br />I do wish at least a little more attention had been paid to Wilberforce's faith, a vital part of his life.  That aside, \\"Amazing Grace\\" is free of the heavy weights political correctness and the twisting of history in order to make sides look good.  It's the story of Wilberforce's battle to abolish slavery without silly, vapid or disparaging embellishments. <br /> <br />Overall this is an excellent and enjoyable film, but more than that, it somehow manages to soothe and inspire at the same time.  I cover world events, politics, and culture, which can be exhausting and depressing to the spirit.  This film was definitely part of the cure for me, and others have said the same thing about the movie.  We saw the film for the third time this evening, and the theatre was still half full although I suspect its run here is just about over (of course we have to make room for more inanity and torture-tainment, don't we?).  But if you can find it, I can't recommend it highly enough.  It is rare for me to give five stars to modern films, but \\"Amazing Grace\\" deserves it.
B000F5GO0A|4.0|kind of repetitive by the end, the songs all start to sound like each other.  Great in small doses, but not an album I can listen to all the time. Very talented group however, I love the vocals!
B000094HMU|5.0|Gorgeous scenery and gorgeous voices and james levine conducting.  how can you not love this?
B000MXPE88|1.0|Well it played fine on my XBOX 360 plugin, but to bad this movie sucked.  Many times it was confusing as it switched back and forth between years, and many times whenever the actor was trying to be dramatic I guess he spoke so softly that you could barelly hear what was going on.  It was long, and could have been greatly improved if only it was better edited.  Lots a parts were just fine, but after nearly three hours, it was like get to the point ya'll.  So if somebody could copy the movie to their harddrive, and then edit it themselves it might be worth watching.  Oh well, major letdown unless your one of those artist types who thinks that you have to look beyond the picture to get the meaning.
B000J10ERO|2.0|Before I get started with my review i must say one thing. Im not just a mindless hater, trying to bash a fanatical fanbase of the legendary superman franchise. I liked the original movies, with the real superman christopher reeves and the real lex luthor gene hackman. with that being said here is why i really didn't like this movie. <br /> <br />i felt it was too long and drawn out. Too much time was spent on Lousi lane crying and complaining about superman not saying goodbye before he left. she whined to her reporter friend, she whined to her husband, she whined to clark kent, she whined to her boss, and finally she whined to superman in another overly long melopdramitic flying scene. essentially making this movie a quasi chick flick/comic flick. and although the soundtrack was stunning at times, too much time was past just showing different scenery and background environments while letting the music play. yes atmoshere is great in movies but enough is enough.  basically im saying this movie was 90% melodrama and atmoshperic mumbo and 10% action.  <br /> <br />and although the action scenes where pretty cool, it is nothing we haven't seen before in a superman flick, or any other super hero flick.  <br /> <br />acting wise, i think the guy playing superman did a pretty good job, nothing compaired to reeves, but im not going to complain about that too much, he was servicable. and noone can complain about kevin spacey, he is just awesome, although i dont think he had the charisma that hackman has as lex. did not like louis lane. too whiney. <br /> <br />story wise, this movie didnt really make much sense. it was way too out there. i mean yeah its a fantasy story and you have to use your imagination but i mean come on. lex luthor is going to basically destroy over half of the worlds population by creating the new continent and people are just going to go \\"yeah lets move there\\" and lex is going to make lots of money. not likely. i mean it would take years among years tomake that crytallic and dark damp place to be somewhat livable. i dont think that lex would really be the type to want to put years of planning and prep to make this work. i mean most criminals want their power NOW, instant gratification. maybe im being overly harsh on a fantasy storyline, i just think they could have thought of something better, and more feasable. <br /> <br />this movie was alright, it would have been helped a lot if they trimed about 30 minutes of melodrama away. and no i am not saying more action and less character development in movies, cause character developement is one of the most important aspects in the success of a truly great movie. however whiny crying does not constitute as strong character development in my book.

B000J103PC|3.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />A sweet, clever but fashion challenged girl Andy (Anne Hathaway) who dreams of becoming a writer suddenly finds a job, \\"million girls would kill for\\", as a second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the draconian demanding editor of the most prestigious fashion Runway magazine in New York City. The job description - to be available for her boss 365/24/7 and to be ready for the labors that even the legendary Hercules would not be able to accomplish.<br /><br />The movie about fashion industry is always fun to watch and \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is not an exception. I loved the look, the clothes, the shoes (OMG!!), the bags, the clips from the fashion shows. Stanley Tucchi is memorable in the supporting role - this guy is seriously underrated. Anne Hathaway is very likable and she's got beautiful eyes and lips. But THE main reason to see the movie is Meryl Streep who reigns and over-towers everything in it as the Uber-[...] Miranda Priestly. She should play the roles like that more often. Big thumbs up! She looked very sexy too. What I did not like - in the film her Miranda comes up somehow sympathetic. In the book she was totally heartless, self-obsessed and manipulating. There are some changes in the script comparing to the book that make Andy's final decision rather unconvincing. What happened in the book made it much more believable. When it comes to the story and the reasons for Andy's feeling guilt, the movie gets weak. I did not see any betrayal or losing the integrity or selling the soul there. Quoting a friend, \\"She did NOT manipulate or back stab or undermine her co-worker. She did a better job. And was rewarded. That is NOT betrayal.\\" And one more thing - why did her friend make such a big deal out of Andy's rather innocent conversation with Christian Thompson at the Art show? With all these \\"serious\\" conflicts, the movie should be called \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\". Once again, bravo to Meryl Streep for her fantastic performance.ic performance.
0743454537|5.0|This book got my attention from the very first page. The reading was made interesting as it was written from the different perspectives of all the characters involved. As a parent you always want the best for your child but when is the \\"best\\" going to far and hurting others that you love?  I have since gone on to read more of Jodi Picoult's books; each one raises questions on dealing with issues of today. Great author!

B000K7VHJQ|5.0|People so often review this film out of ignorance. Christ couldn't have been so scourged. Well, in fact, many historically died just from the scourging alone. He couldn't have shed so much blood. Yet not every condemned prisoner had hundreds of men, not shown in the film, beat him with reeds just to kneel before him in mock. In fact, the film couldn't show how bloody he really was, how severely injured. They tried. But the reality, back then, would have been worse. Some say, the Jewish temple guard would never have laid a hand on him, much less beat him up. And yet that's likely just what they did. He survived to utter the seven last phrases or 'words' from Scriptures because he controlled when his spirit left his body, unlike in the case of any of his creatures. He likely bled more than there is blood in the human body, which is supernatural by itself. <br /> <br />It's holy Saturday, today. And The Passion is a reminder that Christ so loved mankind that he suffered in this way, as the innocent, hated by some of his own priests, particularly the chief priest who was the only one allowed into the holy of holies in the temple, who mocked him as he hung on the cross (as shown in the film). We commemorate his resurrection in another day, rising after three days dead, not a full three days though, and three being the accepted measure by Jewish custom for declaring death. 2000 years later, and he is not forgotten, nor was the new church he founded. And those who defend what his priests and church at the time did to him are still aggressively defending what was done - 2000 years later. And there is no quarter given, and no compromise possible, between the two. It's not unlike the incredible polarization of views on this film, therefore, and about Gibson himself for daring to create this film. <br /> <br />I have some reservations about the depictions in the film. But it was the answer to all those naysayers who complained that previous Biblical epics never showed a bloodyChrist during the Passion. Gibson's film did. And other naysayers proved that you are to be scorned if you do, scorned if you don't, much as in the case of Christ, himself (not that I'm comparing Gibson to Christ, really in any sense, sadly). <br /> <br />The one thing missing from the first release was - everything. I said so in that review. This 'definitive edition' makes up for it and should have been included in the first release, instead. It probably would have sold much more, worldwide, as a result, as well.
B000002H97|4.0|a lot of people are talking about this album being the sellout album of metallica. although i think it was the beginning of the end, i still feel this ablum is metallica. maybe not as technicle and complex as the old stuff, but its still cool. i mean you can say all day long this album is crap sell out stuff, but come on, you'd have to be lying if you said enter sandman, unforgiven, nothing else matters, and where ever i may roam were not classic tunes. good album in my opinion. 3.5 stars.
0060763280|4.0|Want to adopt the mind set that motivates one to get out of debt, and start aquiring wealth? This is the book to do it. Like a dieter who wants to quit dieting and actually change the way they think and feel about food, Secrets of the Millionaire Mind helps you understand how to adopt a healthy way of thinking about bills, debt, and true wealth. Think you have to start making a million dollars a year to be a millionaire. Wrong! Just properly handle what you are making now, and wealth comes to you! It's not magic foofle dust, it's cold, hard economics; the kind that are never taught in average public schools throughout western culture.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|I started to watch Eternal \\"Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\", and after first 15 minutes I realized I could not turn it off and drive to work (which I was supposed to do). I did what Jim Kerry's character Joel did - I called my boss and left her a message that I would be late. I stayed home and I watched the film. I cried, I laughed, I sighed, I felt - I lived through it. There are not so many films that we don't just watch but live through - for me, ESotSM was that. Finally, the Charlie Kaufman's film that I absolutely love. \\"Being John Malkovich\\" amused me; \\"Adaptation\\" irritated me - too much of Charlie in there for my taste even if he looked like Nic Cage. \\"Eternal Sunshine...\\" is Kaufman's masterpiece about relationships, memories, reality, and about intolerance, impatience, inability to listen to the others, to understand them. How easy it is to insult the one you love the most. How difficult it is to forgive yourself for that. How often we rely on the modern technology to fix our inner problems. How seldom we realize that painful and happy memories go together. You can not get rid of ones and keep the others. It may not be the best romance film ever but it is damn close. It is a tender and poignant Valentine Card that Kaufman sent to all of us - to remind us that the love exists, that relationships can survive, and even if they die, we have the memories of them, and nobody or nothing can take our memories from us. Is it just a coincidence that Kaufman references for the second time to the tragic and great love of Eloisa and Abelard in his works?<br /><br />I applaud to Michel Gondry for his brilliant directing; to the supporting cast, including Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet played their best roles ever and I hope to see Carrey more often in the dramatic performances. But in the beginning of everything there was a word - without Kaufman's screenplay the film would not have happened. Thank you, Charlie./> <br />

B00005O3VC|5.0|in the late 70's when i was a pre-teen sitting in front of the tv, i was aimlessly clicking the channel until i came across a sword fight with this trash talking black knight and a crusade leader. every time the crusader would swing his sword, the black knight would loose a limb and blood would stream out of his wound, yet never phasing the knight's determination to engage in combat even when he was only a torso and head. it became my favorite comedy movie of all times. encountering the french was my favorite part.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|A solid movie about the early history of the CIA. Robert De Niro is not among the most fluid of filmmakers, but his movie is consistently informative and interesting. The movie is surprisingly balanced, neither blindly apologetic of the CIA nor wildly condemnatory. De Niro even plays a small role, as a General based on Bill Donovan, the founder of the OSS (the characters in this movie are thinly veiled portraits of real people, but with different names). The protagonist in the movie is Edward Wilson, played by Matt Damon and clearly inspired by James Jesus Angleton (the counterintelligence chief at the CIA for many years). Though the fact that Angleton was half Mexican is omitted here, most of his professional life appears here: his early life as a student of poetry in Yale, his role in World War II as an intelligence officer, his relationship with Kim Philby (who goes here by the name of Arch Cummings, and is played, against type, by Billy Crudup), his role in the Golitsyn-Nosenko affair. He also appears as having a role in two operations he wasn't directly involved: the 1953 coup against Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz and the 1961 failed invasion of Bay of Pigs. One of the few flaws of the movie is its try at amateur psychology by having Wilson's motivations based on the suicide of his father (something which did not happen in Angleton case). But this is, overall, a fine movie, especially if you are interested in its subject matter.

B00005JMJG|4.0|Scenarios of memory-erasure like the one pictured in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind are no longer science fiction... according to an article I read on howstuffworks, researchers at New York University's LeDoux Laboratory have successfully deleted a single, targeted fear memory using drug therapy in rats. Their results, published in Nature Neuroscience, show that the removal of one memory from a rat's brain did not affect other memories there, and that the overall memory system was unharmed.<br /><br />Of course once developed for humans, it could pose treatment for conditions like post-traumatic stress and anxiety disorders. That's all fine and giddy, but the last line of the article made my blood run cold:<br /><br />\\"And of course, the rest of us could use the process to wipe that person who broke our heart out of existence.\\"<br /><br />It seriously makes me wonder what technology will do to us as humans and whether there can be a line drawn between people who seriously need this kind of treatment and those who would do better with a little therapy... as of right now, I know there are several debates centered around the diagnosis of mental disorders and consecutive drug treatments. One simple example that comes to mind is the misdiagnoses of children exhibiting ADD-like symptoms. Popping pills to gain a 'quick fix' without weighing properly the implications and side-effects seems to have become part of our culture.<br /><br />That being said, I loved the movie - it has a unique, twisted sort of humor that is quite fresh. Jim Carrey plays his role well, able to meld his acting to a drama-like atmosphere while still able to evoke his humorous expressions throughout the scene where his memories are being erased. Kate Winslet seemed a little distant to me, but overall still made a satisfying performance.<br /><br />4 Stars
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Embrace this Jane Eyre. It is sensational, the best drama I've seen  in years.            It's a well-known fact that good movies result from good scripts, and this is no exception.  Every word in this production rings true of the original text. It lives and  breathes of Charlotte Bronte's gothic novel, the story of the plain governess Jane who is rewarded for her virtue and of her mysterious employer, Rochester, who is redeemed from his dark past. The highest credit goes to Sandy Welch, who mined the text   and crafted a topnotch script for the screenplay.  How daunting the task when the book happens to be as famous as this one. Or when it has to be compressed into 4 hours.          I adored this novel when I was a teenager, but I'd never seen a movie that captured the spirit of its two main characters as I had personally envisioned them.......until now. And only, by accident. Very little publicity about this series was given here in America,  so sadly, it was not seen by many. (Boo! Masterpiece Theater dropped the ball on this one!)  Luckily, I happened to be channel surfing that night and caught it midstream.                   Within a minute, I was hooked  and from then on, I don't think I blinked once.  The actors were astounding.  I had never heard of either Ruth Wilson or Toby Stephens, so it was a revelation to discover these talented powerhouses.                  Ruth Wilson showed intelligence, inner strength, and suppressed passion in every thing she did. Her quiet, still manner contrasted with facial expressions that barely concealed her growing love for Rochester.             Toby Stephens, in portraying a complex character with conflicting emotions, revealed every inch of Rochester's inner turmoil: his contempt, despair,  cynicism, playfulness, heartbreak, and love. Every second of his performance was electrifying. It didn't hurt that Toby Stephens has the dazzling smile, exquisitely handsome features, and  thrilling baritone voice that easilymake hearts race.  That \\"Wow\\" factor certainly turned me into his fan.            But a great screenplay only works when paired with great acting, and these two actors more than met the challenge.  They invested every line with meaning, showing that they had researched the motivation for every line spoken by their characters. The result was nuanced and dynamic dialog and a richness in characterization that I missed when I had first read the book.            The chemistry between the two was potent -it smoldered like the fire in Rochester's bedroom. I wish the mini-series had been longer. I wish, for instance,  that the script had included Rochester's seductive conversation in the carriage where he tells Jane about their living together in an alabaster cave and comparing her to a fairy. But this is a minor gripe. Overall, this production boasts the highest values. The scenery, the costumes, the castles, and the music were wonderful and lavish. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if tourists soon clamor to Derbyshire to see where all this took place.            Watching this for the first time, be prepared for a fantastic ride. Then add it to your DVD collection for repeated viewing. I, for one, will cherish it as much as the book.            PS  This version has no \\"extras.\\" Another DVD, with deleted scenes and interviews, is supposedly coming out later in the US.  Anyone know the exact date?
1582701709|2.0|While I like the concept of positive thinking, visualizing one's bills in the mailbox as checks to \\"attract\\" money is a bit over the top. I was mortified when one of the individuals quoted in the book was on the Larry King Show and said little Jessica Lundsford, \\"...perhaps subconsciously...\\" attracted a child molester through her bedroom window. Huh??!!! Wait until one of these law of attraction types cannot vibrate their cancer or heart disease into remission, and they will see that not EVERYTHING is in one's mind. I suspect they are promoting the extreme to generate interest and attention, as most Americans (including me!) are always looking for the easy, quick fix. Alas! It is not here either!!
B000B5XOSO|3.0|I never really got Tim Burton. To me he is not much more than a populistic Fellini, a man child with an over active imagination along with the vision and skill to make it look appealing on screen. However, he is the favorite director of some of my closest friends so to say that he doesn't know how to connect with people would be off base. Here he tackles Gotham for a second time and his vision of it a quite festive. The criminals walk on stilts while juggling fire and wearing gaudy skeleton masks. The streets are filled with giant statues that invoke Ayn Rand. And the roofs are incredibly weak, which is convenient because people love crashing through them in this town. It all looks great and I did like this movie but, and forgive me for saying this, it was more of the same from Burton, too much surface.<br /><br />Here Batman battles Catwoman and The Penguin, two villains who really despise him although we are never really given a firm reason why. The other main player is Shreck (no relation to the ogre, played here by Christopher Walken) a Donald Trump type who has risen to the top by breaking laws and breaking necks. When he first meets up with Penguin he is called out for his corporate malfeasance so he does what any other self-respecting tycoon would do, he buys him off. From there they hatch a plan, similar to Bush's 9-11 plan, where together they screw up the city in a bid to get Penguin elected puppet Mayor of Gotham. And hey, in a world of McConnell and Lott he would hardly be the worst publicly elected official out there. This leads to some funny scenes where they try to incorporate Penguin into the world of politics, but the best he can muster is to lustfully leer at any female that walks by and to eat the nose off of his image consultant. To defeat Batman is the ultimate plan and for a while he is bested by the shapely Penguin, and when I say shapely I mean round. Time and again Batman is humiliated, his pride being a major liability, and soon it appears as though it is Batman alone who is sending the city down the tubes. So while I sat through the Wrong Man plot for the 150th time (\\"Batman pushed her off the roof!!\\"), I also had to sit through some serious fat chewing sessions between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle (Catwoman) as they discuss the pros and cons of duality. Of course when she isn't trying to pick Bruce up she is unleashing a litany of back flips and bad double entendres (\\"Be gentle it's my first time\\") on his alter ego. I understand bad one liners are the name of the game because the average fan is 8 years old (in mind and/or body) but this script really went for the gold with them.<br /><br />More than anything I am recommending this film for the Penguin and all his disgusting, creepy glory. This film had you believe that he truly believed that he was a ladies man and possible mayoral candidate. The fighting is more of the bang zoom variety as opposed to the more realistic, violent kind that Christopher Nolan rolled with in \\"Batman Begins.\\" So while this one is nothing special it is worth a look for its creative set design and guilty pleasure appeal. Burton never took the franchise to the heights that Nolan did, but he never sank it like Joel Schumacher did either. So while you watch be sure to count your blessings that rubber lips are nowhere to be found. ***1/4s as though it is Batman alone who is sending the city down the tubes.

0307237699|1.0|A warm, enthusiastic, and hopeful read especially in the context of our current political crisis.  I found Barrack Obama's worldly experience, positive attitude, and youthful spirit refreshing.  Tempering idealism with pragmatism, stressing values over religiousness, and holding strong to the tenets of the US Constitution, he points us to hopeful possibilities.  In essence, he maps the world's future success to its ability to improve the state of equality for its people.<br /><br />For those looking for a step-by-step approach on how to achieve this destiny, you will not find it here.  Barrack Obama offers no magic pill.  However, his proposals although not unique on an individual basis do offer a breath of fresh air when considered collectively.<br /><br />Overall this book helped me recognize Barrack Obama as a model for tomorrow's leader, someone who can see our country though modern eyes reflecting its multiracial character and a value system based on a God of no particular brand.<br /><br />Addendum, September 3, 2010<br /><br />I recently read my old reviews and realized the need to update a couple of them, namely this one and my review on the book, An Inconvenient Truth.<br /><br />What I said in my review still holds but it is only words and they have no power without conviction and follow-through.  Admittedly, I didn't vote for this man yet I am hugely disappointed by the mismatch between his words and his actions as President.<br /><br />In my educated opinion, Barrack Obama is a traitor to our nation and therefore an Enemy of the State.  It is obvious to me from his actions in office that he is beholden, a slave and puppet to the power brokers known in politically correct terms as the &quot;international community&quot; whose agenda is nothing more than creating of a one world socialist state.<br /><br />We are at the brink, ladies and gentlemen, of losing our once great nation and that genuinely depresses me.  God help us
1582701709|3.0|This book may do a lot of good for a lot of people. There is an old saying to the effect that \\"When the student is ready, the teacher appears.\\" Many people may be ready for the teachings of \\"The Secret.\\" This is a difficult age that we live in, and many people are discouraged, anxious, insecure, and unhappy. They might be ripe for the proverbial magic bullet, so this book will do the trick for a lot of those in need of encouragement, inspiration, and empowerment.<br /><br />That being said, I don't find a lot new in this book. It doesn't strike me as groundbreaking or remarkable as much as it is neatly synthesized and packaged. If you are well read in philosophy, psychology, spirituality and the like, the likelihood is that you've heard the main message before in some way, shape, or form. Throw in a dose of karma, positive thinking, visualization, eastern philosophy, and western psychology, and add a dash of Yoda - and the secret just may be that there is no secret. There are so many forces outside our control, that the main tenet of the book strikes me as being a little naive. I am not discounting that the book may help great numbers of people, but I am skeptical that it will provide enduring answers to the complex questions raised by life.
B000957O82|4.0|One of the better romantic comedies I've seen in a while. I was very happy to see Kevin James in this film. He really steals the show considering the screen time devoted to him. The relationship between Kevin's character and the upscale object of his affection is very believable. I would have liked to have seen more of the two of them in this picture. Will Smith is very good as usual and his story adds a good contrast to the people he helps win their dreams girls. All in all it is a funny lighthearted film that I enjoyed. The DVD transfer is very good.

B000NDIAWY|4.0|I was really, REALLY looking forward to this album, since her first really blew me away with her soulful voice, interesting mix of blues-country-folk, and painful lyrics. Just to state my position, she is one of my favorite female singers EVER, and i own all of her cds, specials, and live albums.  <br />this album is VERY good by any standards, so don't let my 4-star rating throw you off. it is a wonderful album, but knowing her first album, i have to say that it falls short. I feel like not as much of her heart was in this album as her previous, and it tends to lean a LOT more towards country than her first. I sense some outside influences and a bit more production than her self-titled.  <br />The best tracks (or the ones i feel that are more apt to represent her originally) are 'The Story' (which makes my heart absolutely ACHE), 'Cannonball', 'My Song' (which i feel was better on the 'Live at Neumo's cd) and 'Hiding my Heart' (a bonus track on the end, that starts at the 7:00 mark on 'Again Today'. It was also on her EP 'Live at Neumo's).  <br /> <br />armed with this information, i really hope you give the cd a listen yourself. however, if you greatly dislike country music, please listen to her self-titled first. OR give 'My Story' a listen. It will win you, easily, and the cd is worth it just for that one song.
B00002E233|3.0|This is one of those movies that you think will really be bad. It turns out it is a pretty good little thriller with some sci-fi thrown in.

B000002MJ0|5.0|With 1991's \\"Loveless\\", My Bloody Valentine produced a landmark album that would redefine the boundaries for independent music. Yet if \\"Loveless\\" was the \\"Revolver\\" of the early 1990's, then \\"Isn't Anything\\" was the band's \\"Rubber Soul\\"- the moment when the band took the game to the next level of sophistication, setting themselves another notch above the competition. This album, judged by the production values of 1988, was the great leap forward. The melodies are lush and beautiful but you have to go searching for them in the opiate fuzz of the shimmering layers of guitar noise. It is well worth the effort. The interplay of melody of distortion on this record is what makes this record so rewarding. The sweetness of the best tunes finds its perfect counterpoint in the drone and fuzz of the guitars. The mix of acidity and sweetness is just right here- a feature that is oddly reminiscent of the other great alternative album from 1988, Sonic Youth's \\"Daydream Nation\\". Whilst My Bloody Valentine would raise their art one step higher with \\"You Made Me Realise\\" later in the year, they were already on the heights with this release. Buy this record, one of the best of the late 1980's and retire to a hazy, fuzzy, bittersweet nirvana.

B000C3H4MC|5.0|\\"Remain in Light\\" is one of the most progressive rock albums made in recent decades. At the time of its release it was a commercial failure for the band but critics have lauded it as a masterpiece since the time of its release and it was rated as the second best album of the 1980's by Pitchfork Media a couple of years back. I do not doubt that the praise is well-deserved. The album was so far ahead of its time that it is hard to believe it was released over a quarter of a century ago. Its synthesis of African guitar styles and rhythms with electronica, punk, New Wave and sounds coming from New York's early hip-hop scene indicated the way music would evolve over the coming twenty years more than any other record of its time. All of the songwriting credits are for David Byrne and producer Brian Eno but the band maintains the tracks came out of jams and certainly the musicianship is tight on the record. The songwriting is also remarkable. The first single \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" finds Byrne in a supposed middle-class paradise with a beautiful wife and home asking himself, \\"How did I get here?\\" Other tracks with their Brazilian and African rhythms seem to depict life the struggles of the poor in teeming cities. \\"Born Under Punches\\", the album opener, falls into this category. The second half of the album shows some highly innovative production. The gorgeous ballad \\"Listening Wind\\" is built around an infectious chorus and rather ominous sounding digital effects. The record culminates in \\"The Overload\\", a song that seems full of dread and gloom. Its slow, deadpan vocal and brooding arrangement set a truly apocylptic mood but this is not the type of music to hit you over the head with political slogans. The song's gloomy atmosphere hints at population overload, social decay and even doomsday but it is too subtle to overstate its case. What Talking Heads made with \\"Remain in Light\\" was one of the most innovative and haunting albums of their time. None of their subsequent releases were half as important as this. This is definitely one of those albums that every serious music-lover should know back to front.ses were half as important as this.

B000JBWWBK|5.0|The music on this cd is so different than what I usually listen to.  When I heard the Wedding Samba on the movie, I knew I had to have the cd.  The cd is just what I thought it would be, a great collection of music that takes me back to the French countryside and downtown London.  Great cd.
0553588486|5.0|As a contemporary author in the fantasy genre, for my money, George R.R. Martin (GRRM)is the best .  This is the book where it all begins and I highly recommend that anyone who is interested in fantasy literature read this book.<br /><br />I do want to post some caveats to reading GRRM.  If you fall in love with characters in a book that you read and it devastates you when these characters die, GRRM may not be the author for you.  GRRM is not afraid to kill off characters that you may think are the heroes of the story.  So, this is a two-edged sword, unlike other fantasy series where you know the hero(es) will prevail regardless of the circumstances, in a GRRM book, your hero(es) may die.  This makes the story much more interesting and riveting.  There are times when I read GRRM that my stomach is in knots because I don't know if one of the characters will live or die.  This is because characters actually do die.<br /><br />Another caveat is that GRRM writes slower than I can read, although this may be a reason that his books are so great.  So I will also list this as a reason to read GRRM.  However, his books are so great that you will finish the series (or at least everything that he has written in the series so far) and be disappointed that he hasn't written books 5, 6, and 7.<br /><br />Another caveat is that GRRM does describe some explicit sexual actions.  So if you are a parent looking for some good fantasy literature for your young teenager or pre-teen to read, this may not be the series for the younger audience.  Although GRRM is accused of gratuitous sex in his books, the sex scenes are far from gratuitious.  In many cases they are necessary to show how a character has developed over time, and keep the plot moving.  One of the greatest aspects about reading a GRRM book is that his characters are believable and perform actions consistent with who they are.<br /><br />The last caveat is if you do not like gray characters, GRRM has few if any characters that are black & white.  Some of the antagonists in earlier books are protagonists in later books.  So if you are one of those readers who likes to have a villain to root against and hate, GRRM may not be for you.  In fact, one of the most despicable characters Game of Thrones, is later on one of my more favorite protagonists in Storm of Swords and Feast for Crows.<br /><br />With the above caveats given I want to explain why you ought to read this book.<br /><br />GRRM does not waste words.  Even at the beginning of this book there is much foreshadowing, literary allusion, and metaphor.

The 'industrial strength' application of possible worlds theories can sometimes take a while to understand: why the dentist's $10m is worth more than the $10m of his lottery-winning former janitor neighbour, and so on.

0790740443|5.0|Although this movie didn't do great at the box office, it continues to provide a strong multi-level entertainment.<br />  Yes, the movie has good sci-fi action adventure complete with believeable sets, futuristic equipment and a Sparta like training regimine taken to an extreme end--but, we also find the emotional content of the soldier who was de-humanized from training become human again after meeting the loving family. We find a small tramatized child who shares a \\"quiet\\" in common with the soldier. The soldier is also dealing with \\"old age\\" after a fashion.<br />  For me, this movie makes it into my personal top ten.

6302426499|2.0|Given high acclaims this film has collected over time, I was glad to pick up a VHS copy at my local library sale.  Began to watch it last night.  I was able to sit thru the part 1.  When the tape ended, I was actually glad. I felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1!  The movie is DREARY to the max.  People portrayed are irrational, lost, uncommunicative, and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers.  In some way, this movie reminded me of the dreary winter (lasting 6 months!) I spent in Russia a couple of years ago...  <br /> <br />To me, the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of Soviet state (1920-1956).  For survivors, nothing made any sense anymore, except perhaps fear and evil, as people in this dreary film reflects.  People have been already destroyed in their souls.  They are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the Bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience.  <br /> <br />Maybe that is the real meaning of this movie.  To really reflect what happened to people's psyche after Lenin and Stalin's UNLIMITED TERROR, they found a parallel in Mongol's devastation and oppression of medieval Russia.  In both cases, people were left shattered, helpless, irrational, withdrawn,  and autistic.
B00005JPO8|5.0|\\"The Lives of Others\\" is a wonderfully thoughtful and provocative film that goes to the heart of the failure of socialism in eastern Europe.  Its languid, contemplative pace envelopes the viewer.  Indeed, at the showing that I attended, the film received warm and spontaneous applause.  This is not the norm!<br /><br />The film is set in 1984 (how appropriate!) and revolves around the lives of Georg Dreyman played by Sebastien Koch and his lover and partner Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck).  Their relationship is warm and loving.  However, as a writer, Dreyman is constantly being monitored by the dreaded Stasi or secret police.  He comes under the careful eye of Gerd Weisler as played by Ulrich Muhe.  It is this period of observation around which the film is built.<br /><br />Gradually, the cold and earnest Weisler comes to respect his suspects.  He slowly seems to admire what they have and what he and East Germany are missing.  In the end, he proves to be a man of honour within a system that is itself totally corrupted.<br /><br />Have no doubts, this is a great film that won the 2007 Oscar for best foreign language film.  And deservedly so!  Do not be put off by the obvious fact that the film is recorded in German with English sub-titles.  To use this as an excuse not to see the film would be asinine.  This is one of the best films of the year!
B0002W18MU|5.0|This CD is really one of Johnny Cash's best piece of work. I bought this for my husband who's a big fan.  My husband heard the song \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\" - and I was on a hunt to find the CD.  We have several Cash CDs and have an eclectic collection of music. We were surprised with the CD.  It's raw Cash.  \\"309\\" has now become a new favorite.  My favorite is the remake of Gordon Lighfoot's \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\".  Cash's scuffy, deep, voice gives great contrast to the songs softness -- it's a beautiful combination.
0812550706|4.0|Finished reading \\"Ender's Game\\" tonight, one of the most sadistic / political / depressing works of sci-fi I've ever read, combining the grey political bleakness of \\"1984\\", with the foreboding creepy space doom of \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\". The book is centered around a trio of Kwisatz Haderach-like siblings, one of whom (Ender) ends up endlessly tortured throughout the book in a \\"Lords Of The Flies\\" meets \\"The Lords Of Discipline\\"-type environment of sanctioned cadet abuse. The story is just beyond gloomy, and the unease never lets up. Every adult is using every other, as are the siblings and the cadets - none of whom feel like real children, ever. In fact, it's probably safe to say that the students in \\"Ender's Game\\" feel more like little Karl Roves and Henry Kissingers than anything else, at least when they're not conspiring to bully and/or murder Ender Wiggin. Note: Although the book was written in 1977, aside from a certain overuse of the rather quaint word \\"astronaut\\" and a few references to Pac-Man, it rarely feels dated. In particular, the descriptions of the \\"Nets\\" and interactive 3-D simulators are amazingly true today, and the Peter & Valentine Wiggin plan to take over the world through anonymous blogging & punditry is uncanny. Same goes for the imperialistic/hegemonic machinations of the world community (largely the US and Russia in the story, in a nod to the Cold War perhaps) and the hawkish discussions of plans to establish world domination by leveraging the propaganda power of exaggerated and misunderstood alien threats is timely indeed. A few politically incorrect (and mostly unnecessary) bits regarding Jews, Spanish, and menstruation probably wouldn't have made it into the story today. Oddly, Ender's sister Valentine is the closest thing to a love-interest that Ender has in the entire book - but given all the isolation and gore that comes his way as the Powers That Be warp his childhood recreating Earth's military savior (cue \\"The Boys From Brazil\\") there is no happy ending or pleasant morality to save the day. All there is a little bit of hope that Ender might be able to eventually atone for unknowingly leading Earth in a preemptive genocidal war against an alien race by rescuing its sole survivor.<br /><br />Although the recommended age of the book (\\"10 and up\\") puts it squarely in the middle of the Harry Potter set, this is serious reading and social commentary better aimed at the 10th and 11th grades. The fact that the story is built around such young kids (6-9 being typical) given the weighty and complex adult themes is just... weird. Same goes for the fart jokes, as has been mentioned elsewhere - this is a novel for older teens, and a weighty one well worth serious in-class discussion.

(and BTW, helped along in this area with some Teacher's Guidelines in the back) <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002IAS|5.0|From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:<br /><br />Delaney & Bonnie and Friends was a group started by Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, which featured the elite session artists of the day, such as Carl Radle, Jim Price, Bobby Keys, Rita Coolidge, Bobby Whitlock, Jim Gordon, Leon Russell, Dave Mason and revolving guest lead guitarists which would include Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Duane Allman and even some appearances with Jimi Hendrix.<br /><br />Prior to their marriage and collaboration, Delaney had been a well-regarded LA session musician, and Bonnie had the distinction of being the only white Ikette, performing with the Ike and Tina Turner Revue. In later years, she turned to acting, appearing most notably on the TV shows \\"Fame\\" and \\"Roseanne\\", under her new name of Bonnie Sheridan.<br /><br />In 1970, after Delaney and Bonnie & Friends, Eric Clapton formed Derek and the Dominos, with Delaney and Bonnie members, Carl Radle, Bobby Whitlock, and Jim Gordon as his rhythm section.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I just wanted everyone to know the whole story and the different cast members one might have seen while they were touring. Also notable; is that many of the Derek & The Dominos survivors, ended up becoming Leon Russell's \\"Shelter People\\". During this same era, Leon Russell and Bonnie wrote \\"Super Star\\" (Originally titled 'Groupie') and went to #1 by Karen Carpenter. Also written during this era, Leon Russell and Eric Clapton's song \\"Blues Power\\".<br /><br />I have had this recording in 8 track, LP, cassette and now compact disc. One reviewer was harsh about the CD quality. IMHO every form I've ever heard, this concert made me WELL PLEASED.
B00005JPLU|4.0|What a beautifully executed mess. Artistically stunning and dynamic on the large screen, \\"300\\" excels at sucking you into its big, empty-headed world just on the unbelievable visuals.<br /><br />Sadly, that is the best thing about the \\"300.\\" After that, I start to wonder why I see more 6-pack abs on the Spartans than on any men since I last visited West Hollywood's Gymnasium Row. In fact, this has got to be one of the most homoerotic movies to spit out such virulently homophobic dialog (the disparaging comments about \\"philosophers and boy-lovers\\"). Which leads me to my next gripe. \\"300\\" is so inundated with CGI that you begin to wonder if there really were any actors here. Who ever designed the computer application to slap every Spartan with that hyper-body must have made a mint. Same for the guys that worked on the decapitation program. And the flying blood shots. Also - for ALL directors of action movies from now on - ENOUGH of the fast/slow/fast \\"Matrix\\" digital roto-scoping battles scenes! Please make a movie that doesn't look like you're designing a video game!<br /><br />Which is, ultimately, why I can't give \\"300\\" the five-stars that Miller and company obviously thought they were making. This is less a movie than a propagandist's art project. Otherwise, why make Gerard Butler a Jesus look-alike (especially his final scene) who spends most of his dialogue time speaking in soldier bark; \\"SPARRRRTAAAANNNNSSSSS!\\" starts most of his major scenes. Or why have the leader of the Persians look like RuPaul with more bling than all the members of 365 Mafia and more makeup than The Cure? Or why that all the He-men of Sparta (another great line early in \\"300,\\" \\"Only Spartan women can give birth to real men.\\") are all big-muscled white Europeans in leather and loincloths while the Persians are pierced and tattooed punks, mutants and drag queens?<br /><br />Both \\"Alexander\\" and \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" were better than \\"300\\" as historical fact-based movies. And you've seen these battles in \\"Lord Of The Rings,\\" \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Braveheart,\\" done better. But for sheer big-screen popcorn action, the cartoon antics of the mighty Spartans makes \\"300\\" a good afternoon of empty-headed fun.Rings,\\" \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Braveheart,\\" done better.

1416914285|5.0|This book was a great pleasure to read from the beginning to the end. The world that Cassandra Clare built was a delight to visit,, had its own satisfying logic, and was deliciously detailed. I can't wait for more. The characters were great and written with a depth that made me feel like they were really people. The book was funny and made me smile and laugh out loud many times. It was such a fun ride as well as emotionally pulling me into the story and really making me care what happened. There were countless beautiful or quirky descriptions. I love how the world of Nephilim is interspersed with real life like taking the subway; my favorite kind of fantasy is the kind thats connected to normal life and it was very entertaining. As well as action, adventure, and mystery, it also had romance and angst that I'm dying to see more of:) eeeeeee!!:) I think the romance was well-written, and also that it is really fun to read about the rollercoaster that is teenager's love lives. I think the best books are the ones that create a world you'd want to live in, and I would definitely love to live in Cassandra Clare's world. I'll have to settle for rereading it many times:) I loved this book.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|A musical meditation of the \\"Rise Of Machine and The Decline Of Man,\\" the second Alan Parsons Project album hit all the notes that \\"Tales Of Mystery and Imagination\\" missed. For starters, this was a straight forward rock album, without the debut's classical pretensions. It was also where Parsons perfected his atmospheric instrumentals, opening the album with the (precursor to electronica) title track and then ending with the moody \\"Genesis Ch 1 V 32.\\" You do get the jarring soundtrack climax of \\"Total Eclipse,\\" which I always guessed was where man got terminated from the scene.<br /><br />For an album that dealt with the fall of the human race, \\"I Robot\\" is a surprisingly human affair. The slow beat disco of \\"I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You\\" and the dance floor paranoia of \\"The Voice\\" are anything but mechanical. The ballads of loss, \\"Don't Let It Show\\" and \\"Day After Day (The Show Must Go On)\\" could be about any typical heartbreak. Even Pat Benatar could spot the drama inherent to \\"Don't Let It Show,\\" including it on her debut.<br /><br />It wasn't just the drama and the sci-fi that made \\"I Robot\\" so interesting. It was the musicianship. Not as pretentious as ELP and bringing the acrobatics of Yes down to bite size nuggets, Parsons had no difficulty in constructing pop that was progressive, meticulously produced and built up like the studio architect that he is. The Alan Parsons Project recording an album in the period of the seventies this pristine when disco's big boom was steamrollering everything in its path was a pretty bold statement then. Because of Parsons' attention to detail overriding any urge to make music of the moment, \\"I Robot\\" still holds up almost 30 years later.
B000MRA5EM|4.0|Since this DVD is only 40 minutes long I passed on buying it, but it is absolutely worth the rental fee. The footage is up to the usual breathtaking IMAX standards. Crytal clear and with vibrant colors even on the small 19 inch set I watched it on. If you've watched any number of undersea documentaries, you're probably already familiar with most of the sealife that is covered, but again it's the visuals that make this so breathtaking as well as the message that much of this life is being destroyed by man (as usual) and most be conserved. I highly recommend it. The only reason I rate the DVD with 4 stars rather than 5 is that it's not even an hour long and there are no bonus materials what so ever. But the 40 minutes are well worth the a rental.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|I have seen all the James Bond movies several times, from \\"Dr. No\\" through this one. This movie, \\"Casino Royale\\" is without question the worst of all. <br />Oddly, Daniel Craig, plays a very realistic and authentic \\"James Bond.\\" He looks and acts very much like a man who has a \\"license to kill,\\" but even Daniel Craig's acting could not save this horribly written movie. <br />The leading lady, is possibly the ugliest \\"Bond Girl\\" ever, and wears so much eye-liner that she looks like something from a zombie movie. <br />The first half of the movie is barely worth watching, but it just gets progressively worse. By the time the movie was over I was very happy that it was FINALLY over. <br />This is the ONLY movie in the James Bond series that I will leave out of my collection. It is absolutely NOT worth your money.
B00004T9UF|5.0|When i first heard this album back in 2000 it was out of this world,i listin to the album the other day and it just sounds as fresh as it does today.I have to give a big thumbs up to DR DRE as he created most of the beats and backing music for this album, and produced it.As is all of DRE,S producing from past to present its top notch, big ups to EMINEM and DR DRE,i even own the EMINEM license plate in new zealand as when i purchased the plate back in 99 the operator said who or what is that never heard of him,how times change,come on EM get back with DRE and try and produced another album like this.Its your best.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|\\"The Good Shepherd\\" is an interesting, but ultimately frustrating, close to three hour slog.  DeNiro, who directed the movie, shows, for the most part, restraint in his CIA epic.  There are some preachy moments where DeNiro seems to be making some comment on current events, and even a few Oliver Stone like whoppers, cloaked in the movie's muted tone.  Whatever.  But at one point there is the inevitable Be-Careful-You-Don't-Lose-Your-Soul line.  The problem is that the movie, by the time that line is delivered, has established in the viewer's mind that what is being watched is pretty much soulless exercise in filmmaking.  As much as it wants to be, the film never seems to develop into an Epic.  The Length is there, the meticulous craftsmanship in the framing of scenes (why I'm giving this 3 stars), but when it comes to getting a real historical sweep, things get hazy.  Oh, there's the Bay of Pigs, and old Nazi clips, but historical hooks are surprisingly few.  The lead casting is also very questionable.  Damon as the robotic and detached \\"company\\" man, Edward Wilson, and the exotic Jolie as the wife and mother, Clover - Margaret, is bizarre.  Actually, both actors do very well, it's just that physically they seem to be wrong fits for the roles.  Further, neither actor seems to ever age in a movie that spans decades.  The model here, was obviously the \\"Godfather II.\\"  Unfortunately, the Good Shepherd lack both the scale and the story of what is one of the greatest American films.  And that should have been expected.  <br /> <br />The movie does have several \\"good\\" moments however.   The Skull & Crossbones stuff, seemed pretty authentic, even if you've read about it a dozen times in fiction and nonfiction.   And the plane ride murder is chilling, as is the brutal interrogation of a defector.  But three hours worth?  No. Try the \\"Quiet American,\\" it's shorter, and much better film that deals with the world of shadows.  <br />
096798467X|5.0|Kiko's new book presents a more in depth discussion than the previous edition, of clay ovens one could build in their backyard, from their backyard. The use of hand drawn illustrations and photographs leave little mystery as to designing, creating and using these ovens, with a great deal of freewill fanciful inspiration captured and relayed to the reader. From 'engineering' to trouble shooting, a down to earth (literally) guide to getting in touch with our true nature of living simply.
0385720920|1.0|Chief Justice Brennan in 1957 described this book when he wrote the Roth decision and defined obscenity.  When a work is utterly without redeeming social importance and when for the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest, it is obscene.  This book about a sex addict is marked by an immoderate and/or unwholesome interest in unusual sexual desire: the very definition of prurient. Choke could be subtitled: ' A Dictionary of Genitalia and Sexual Intercourse to Debase the Human Body and the Sex Act.'
B0000A118M|5.0|Like \\"Kind of Blue\\" this is a recording accessible to all listeners, resisting facile classifications (fusion, jazz, modal, musician's music, general public's music, etc.).  Coltrane's Promethean questing sweeps up and includes the listener, taking him or her through the hero's journey, which concludes on an affirmative note of thanksgiving and peace.  Moreover, the musical motifs are in themselves memorable, satisfying the listener's need for a musical stronghold in which to ground the spiritual thrust of the extra-musical religious-spiritual meanings.<br /><br />Of the recordings after \\"A Love Supreme,\\" \\"Transition\\" achieves a similar visionary ascent, though much of the recorded documentation of Coltrane's last two years is likely to prove inaccessible or at least less engaging to the average listener.  It's music \\"in\\" but also \\"of\\" the moment, a record of pain and anger, protest and revolution, carrying an unmistakable political subtext that frequently overwhelms the main musical text.<br /><br />Arguably the most influential instrumentalist of the past 50 years, Coltrane left the listener plenty of choices, should the recordings after \\"A Love Supreme\\" prove unsatisfying.  \\"My Favorite Things\\" is the perfect antidote to the cloying soprano sax sound of Kenny G. (as is the soprano sax playing of the deeply expressive and moving traditionalist, Sidney Bechet).  For every serious musician, however, perhaps the one recording by Coltrane that belongs at the top is \\"Giant Steps.\\"  Once a musician has mastered the dominant-tonic movement of popular harmonies, the next essential step is learning how to negotiate the \\"Giant Steps\\"/\\"Count Down\\" harmonic movement that Coltrane introduced.  Before learning the theory, however, a listener needs to experience the stunning freshness that is its musical result.  With the motivation, the theory is likely to be realized far more efficiently and effectively.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi's sophomore album, The Story, is proof positive that this band is well on their way to a happy ending! What is surely a match made in heaven, Brandi Carlile and her identical twin counterparts and songwriting soulmates (Tim and Phil Hanseroth) have crafted an album that exposes a soul that is much older and wiser than Brandi's 25 years. While her debut album was well-received The Story reaches deep to expose a vulnerability and willingness to wear her heart on her sleeve. Flanked by flawless twin harmonies, Brandi's voice paints a picture that is refreshingly imperfect and one that we all identify with. T-Bone Burnett's approach to recording this album lends itself perfectly to the underlying rawness often heard in Brandi's voice - especially during her live shows. Brandi and the Twins are well on their way...fueled by an integrity and wisdom that is sorely lacking in today's music.
0609610570|4.0|Larry and Ram talk about their experiences with managing big companies. However, their advice is not only useful to CEOs but generally makes sense for everybody: Be honest about your goals, ambitions, and resources and follow up with your people. A disciplined way of working is both efficient and effective. Stress is minimized and success is assured. Too bad that most people do not follow these simple rules and therefore spread a lot of grief, turmoil, and stress.
B000O178BY|5.0|I have been a NIN fan since day one. Since the first time I heard Pretty Hate Machine. I have never been disappointed with any single recording Trent Reznor has ever put forth into the musical stratosphere. Having said that, I will admit that With Teeth did seem like a step back in the progression of his genius. Not to say that I don't absolutely love With Teeth, it was just very hard for me to accept into the Halo family. It took me about 5-6 listens before I got it. I am one of the very few faithful NIN fans that will defend that album to no end. I was extremely concerned when I heard that Year Zero was coming out so quickly. Mr. Reznor is not one to be rushed, he makes no artistic compromises to his vision no matter the circumstances. Year Zero has effectively blown me away. I am very proud that I have been singing NIN praises for years. This album has it all. I am excited. I want every one I know to hear this recording, because if there were ever a NIN album that displayed the pure and utter genius of NIN, it is Year Zero. This is the new The Downward Spiral. There is not a week track on the album, and each one is intricately sewn together with the next. This is what a concept album should be. And I am only touching the surface of the brilliance of this album. Every artist in music no matter what their genre need to take note of this album. This is what music is supposed to be. This is a very exciting time for NIN fans. I would be very surprized if this album doesn't win every award and accolade it truly deserves. Thank you so much Trent and everyone that had a hand in this album. You have truly created a masterpeice. I cannot wait for what is to follow. I know I will not be disappointed.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|If you want to hear the definition of tight, this is the album.  Road hardened as all Hell, Clutch has managed to produce the most amazing neo-blues album ever.  This is the most dirty album I have heard in a while, and it's refreshing.  Most of the tracks on here sound as if they should have been written by blues greats like \\"Howlin'\\" Wolf, Tennessee Williams, and Muddy Waters.  Instead, Neil Fallon shows his lyrical love of the blues by paying homage through his own words.  On \\"You Can't Stop Progress\\" he lets us know that \\"I understand there are no victimless crimes, that being said, I feel rather victimized\\".  On \\"Electric Worry\\" the catchy hook \\"Bang Bang Bang Bang...Vamanoose Vamanoose\\" reminded me of when they played this live, six months before the release of this album. Now I look back and feel as if I was a small part of rock history as they honed this tune live.  There are so many other examples that I could site, but I don't want to leave the rest of the band out.     Though I was initally disappointed that there was no jam session for the last track, I now understand that this album was meant to highlight the entire band. Tim Sult,on lead guitar, manages to impress by the notes he doesn't play.  This is the sign of a truly mature musician.  When he does pull out a solo, they're at times minimalistic, which speaks to his character.  I have to say, that despite how much I love the sound of his guitar on such greats as \\"Tim Sult vs. The Greys\\", \\"(Notes From the Trial of) La Curandera\\" and \\"Swampt Boot Upside Down\\".  That does not mean that Sult lacks in any area.  The tightness of the turnaround blues of \\"Child of the City\\" is reminiscent of \\"Black Dog\\" by Led Zeppelin.  Also, whichever band mate is playing the slide guitar on \\"Black Umbrella\\" reminds us of the classic blues riffs of days long past.    If you are a bass player, listen to this album.  Again, Dan Maines is tight and proves that he's worthy to be called a \\"Master of the Electric Bass\\".  Maines does an amazing job from the turnaround blues on \\"Child of the City\\" to driving the bass of \\"Mr. Shiny Caddylackness\\".  This is a complete album that will challenge you, and let you learn the basics of blues.    The drums by, Jean-Paul Master, and organs by Mick Schauer play a laid back role on this album.  Master has shown his greatness on songs such as \\"Droid\\" (all future drummers out there, listen to this song so you know why you should learn your rudiments), but takes on the classic role of drummer in this venture.  This is not to say he is not impressive.  Master drives the songs with a unrelenting yet semi-subdued force, again, a testament to the bands musical maturity.  Schauer also does an excellent job adding color to the music.  In Clutch's prevous venture \\"Robot Hive/Exodus\\", Schauer's first album with the band, he was showcased on many songs to show that he was a worthy addition to the band.  And on this album, he proves it again by accenting and giving a warm undertone to the simple genious of the songs.     In all, this album is a definite pick up.  There is not a bad song in the bunch, and I would have gladly paid twice what I did.  Why this band hasn't gained commercial success is obvious, they are too sophisticated for modern pop music.  From the thickness of the grooves to the lyrical insanity, Clutch has once again proven that they are the best band in the last 20 years.    Hope that was helpfull,    PX
0060254920|5.0|My newborn is due on the 29th of April.  I am looking forward to reading this to her when she comes.  I had this book as a child and loved it.  The book came in on time and was in great condition.

B00000K19E|5.0|When I first saw this movie all I could think about was Logan's Run. I still do. Both movies deal with conformity and escape from a totalitarian world run by something computer-like. Matrix kicks it up a notch and is more entertaining and more technologically advanced (the original is from 1976?). I loved it a lot!
032147404X|4.0|This is a fantastic book covering all aspects of digital photography with dSLR's, although probably a little simplistic for veteran photographers.  The author mostly references techniques of Adobe Photoshop elements and/or CS.  If you don't already own or plan on buying either of these programs, you may want to look elsewhere.  Granted, the basic tips of shooting dSLR pictures are great, and the author covers all types of shooting situations and scenarios.  Additionally, the book covers presentation, printing, and even making money with your camera.  Fantastic book overall, and highly recommended to anyone getting serious with digital photography.
B00008AWNY|5.0|(This review refers to the LP Record version)<br />(I really wish I could have just posted this on the page for the [[ASIN:B00008AWNY Dark Side of the Moon LP Record]] instead)<br /><br />That's right, no further nastiness about how bad the CD layer is on the 30th anniversary re-release.  No debate over the goofy stained glass cover which isn't actually on this version.  I'm not even going to explain how many copies this album has sold and why (like every other reviewer on Amazon).  This is The Dark Side of the Moon as you should have been hearing it all along.<br /><br />The actual record is pressed on \\"heavyweight virgin vinyl,\\" which I assume means vinyl that hasn't been recycled previously.  Even on my hundred dollar [[ASIN:B00005T3XH Sony PSLX250H Turntable]], Dark Side of the Moon played at a very consistent, steady 33 1/3 RPM and with very little noise.  Nick Mason's cymbals come through high and clear as if he's playing in the same room, and Roger Waters' bass is equally clear on the other end of the spectrum.  Right in the middle are Richard Wright's keyboards and David Gilmour's vocals and guitar, which are undistorted and quite sweet.  From the 96/24 digital backup I made with my [[ASIN:B0002ZH6QY Creative Labs SoundBlaster Audigy 2 Platinum 6.1-Channel Sound Card]], it appears this vinyl version has an even better dynamic range than the stereo SACD.<br /><br />As for the package, have they missed ANYTHING?  I mean the original cover art is reproduced down to the gatefold and all the original posters, they've included two additional posters, though one was miniature and slid under the shrink wrap in front of the prism and just says what's in the package with another pyramid photo.  The only unfortunate thing is NONE are going to end up on any of my walls!<br /><br />I give this release an overall resounding five stars, as nothing has been retouched, simulated, digitized, or omitted from what I can tell.  Well ok, if they wanted us to all die happy they would have re-released the quad version as a companion, but... naaah.  I'm happy.n as a companion, but... naaah.  I'm happy.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I'll admit it. I'm a huge Brandi Carlile Band fan and as far as I'm concerned, they can do no wrong. But I didn't buy this cd with the idea that I would automatically love it. I've listened to older versions of these songs dozens if not hundreds of times before. Of the new versions, some of the arrangements are different and some of the lyrics have changed; I wasn't sure if I would like them or not. The great news is that I truly love this new album. I think the band made excellent choices in their material and in the changes that they made. <br /> <br />I am flat-out obsessed with the song 'Josephine'. I can't get over how beautifully simple it is. 'Cannonball' and 'Again Today' and 'My Song' are also favorites, but honestly, I can't say which song is my absolute favorite since nearly every single one of them has been my favorite at one time or another.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, one of the best things about this album is that it more accurately reflects the band's live sound. Not many bands can sound as good, if not better than their album but this band does it every single time. Their talent simply blows me away.
B000007489|5.0|You know why i like Suicidal?  I like how they have african americans in their band.  I am african american myself.  I like thrash, metal, punk, hardcore, and stuff like that.  I like to see other african americans involved in hardcore, and metal.  I like The dead kennedys, Bad brains, and other bands who have included other races like mine in their bands.  This album is incredible.  I got it quite a while back and was hooked from the first track.  It's fast and aggressive.  I am a skater too, and this is great skate music.  This is a great album so buy it.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|The first time I listened to this CD, I fell in love with it! It's absolutely fabulous, even better than her self-titled album. This album is a little country, a little folk and a little rock/pop. I would normally list all of my favorite songs, but in this case there are just too many! Brandi Carlile is very talented. What a voice she has and the lyrics to her songs are fantastic. Obviously, I can't say enough about \\"The Story\\". If you enjoyed her first album, you will surely love this one. Why this girl is not more well-known, I don't know!
B000I2MRHE|5.0|My newborn hated tummy time on the floor. Would lay his head down and just cry, just like my daughter had. I bought the lamaze spin and explore, and he loved it. Within days, he could hold his head all the way up for minutes at a time, and now that he is four months old, he spins himself around playing with the different toys attached. Great buy!

B00000AFGM|1.0|I was a pre-antichrist Manson fan.  Marilyn Manson was not only an inspiration to me, and a representation of what I myself stood for and believed, even as a preadolescent child, but he was a saviour.  I looked to him as the answer to life's most fundamental questions.  When I saw the video for the dopeshow in 1998 I became nauseous.  I suppose one could hurl invectives at me such as that I had or have no \\"life\\", or that I am a fool for believing so in another human being, but one must remember that we are all looking for answers, and when you think you find one, and then it's comfort is violently ripped away from you, it's bound to make you pretty sad.  It makes me sad.  I believe in the transforming powers of the arts.  Marilyn Manson was a great human triumph up until Mechanical Animals, it was a big disappointment.  This album gets one star for crushing my childhood dreams.
B000NA77YO|2.0|I am a die hard Sabbath fan and to me the first 5 Sabbath albums are must have cd's for any true metalhead. However in life, times change and so do band members.<br /><br />After major successes with their first 5 albums, the group was starting to have some internal issues. The writing seemed to be on the wall in that their next two release were sub par efforts. The band had come to the conclusion that continuing on with Ozzy was an impossibility and the search was on to find the right replacement.<br /><br />Ronnie James Dio was chosen to replace Ozzy after Ozzy was told his services were no longer needed. From the get go, the chemistry between Dio and the rest of the group was magic. Dio's far out imagery/fantasy lyrical style fit in perfectly with Sabbath's style of writing. The Heaven and Hell release was a fantastic piece of music and the follow up Mob Rules was just as good. They had given themselves a fresh lease on life with Ozzy's departure. However as I stated above, times change and so do band members. After they recorded Live Evil, the band ended it's relationship with Dio and moved on yet again. However years later, Dio was back in the fold and they recorded Dehumanizer with little or no fan fair. We Sabbath fans new this release would be very good because that's what we've come to expect from this collaboration. It was indeed a very good cd and yet, it never really took off like those early 80's releases did and Ronnie was out again.<br /><br />Well here we are again with a Dio Sabbath reunion tour/release and this time they have given us a greatest hits package that contains those classic tunes and a three new ones.<br /><br />Overall I have to say that I'm a very happy that these guys are again back together. I saw them in concert just a week ago and they still rock! However as excited as I was to see them again and to hear that they would be releasing some sort of new material, I was just as disappointed to hear what this new release would be. My biggest disappointment with this release is NOT because of what it contains, it's what it DOESN'T that bugs me. I was really hoping for a Black Box style release when Dio returned this time out. I wanted all the Dio stuff remastered and put into one nice bigass package. I wanted all the tunes to be present from those great releases and a book containing history/pics of those years in that package. This is what I wanted!!<br /><br />This release is good, but it's a far cry from what it could have been. The three new tunes rock and tell me these guys can still write together.

I wanted all the tunes to be present from those great releases and a book containing history/pics of those years in that package. This is what I wanted!!     This release is good, but it's a far cry from what it could have been. The three new tunes rock and tell me these guys can still write together. The older ones sound fuller and fatter and a whole lot better than the original cd's do. However I just can't help but wonder what a fully remastered Heaven & Hell would sound like.

0618680004|4.0|Dawkins is a celebrated evolutionary biologist who, along with Sam Harris (The End of Faith), has emerged as one of the better known proponents of atheism in contemporary literature. Both books have been New York Times best sellers.<br /><br />In my own work, New Pilgrim Chronicles, I have likewise argued for the critical need of the species to evolve from faith to reason:<br /><br />\\"Faith, as the antithesis of reason, is a barbarous relic that<br /><br />must be discarded if civilization, much less any prospect for<br /><br />freedom, is to emerge.\\"--from Chapter 5, New Pilgrim<br /><br />Chronicles.<br /><br />Apparently, being in favor of reason is the right thing to be these days: even Al Gore is getting into the act come spring of 2007 with The Assault on Reason.<br /><br />Dawkins' main thesis is the natural world and even sentient beings such as ourselves are accounted for by natural explanations. Thus, God is not a requirement for and has a vanishingly small probability of existence.<br /><br />Dawkins' approach is mainly to counter various arguments that have been made for the Supreme Being, e.g.:<br /><br />* Thomas Aquinas' propositions<br /><br />* Arguments from morality and beauty<br /><br />* The ontological argument<br /><br />* Argument from personal experience<br /><br />* Pascal's Wager<br /><br />His writing is crisp and clear, kindly devastating every common claim; the presentation is thoroughly enjoyable. He assembles some wonderful quotations from brave thinkers:<br /><br />\\"There is in every village a torch -- the teacher: and an extinguisher -- the clergyman.\\" --Victor Hugo<br /><br />\\"To talk of immaterial existences is to talk of nothings. To<br /><br />say that the human soul, angels, god, are immaterial, is to<br /><br />say they are nothings, or that there is no god, no angels,<br /><br />no soul. I cannot reason otherwise.\\"--Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />\\"I have never imputed to Nature a purpose or a goal, or<br /><br />anything that could be understood as<br /><br />anthropomorphic.\\"--Albert Einstein<br /><br />The Jefferson quote brings me to the objection that Dawkins doesn't start by defining God. If he had done so, he probably would have determined--as Antony Flew did in the classic God and Philosophy--that the standard definition of God from the Book of Common Prayer makes it difficult for the concept of God to get off the ground at all.<br /><br />...<br /><br />For my complete review of this book and for other book and movie<br /><br />reviews, please visit my site [...]<br /><br />Brian Wright<br /><br />Copyright 2007hropomorphic.\\"--Albert Einstein <br /> <br />The Jefferson quote brings me to the objection that Dawkins doesn't start by defining God.

B000IZJZLM|5.0|I just received Siempre by IL DIVO to complete my collection.  I can't believe it, but this one is beyond great!  The four voices and personalities blend better than they did previouisly, David and Carlos have finally joined the band rather than being two soloists working to outdo each other. They now very naturally work to blend their voices with Urs and Sebastien.  Urs' voice used to annoy me as it was presumably well trained but had an annoying white tone'd vibrato that made him seem insecure.  In this CD, Urs truly has found his place and he has modulated the white tone and vibrato (yes, in the same voice) and now presents a beautiful, clear, tenor to add to the outstanding music.  Most dramatically, Sebastien, the step-child from the Pop world, has found his voice. He is now singing in full voice, as well as gentle and quiet, has gained enormously in confidence and is a vital member of the band.  Carlos and David are better than ever as leads.  All the men have matured and Siempre is an outstanding work of art that meets Simon Cowell's criteria; the band was designed to 'cross-over' Pop and Opera.<br /><br />The back-up orchestrations are still magnificent and provide the perfect back drop for IL DIVO.<br /><br />This CD truly is incredible.
0060589469|5.0|This book was a staple of my college days, not among the Left--the Left in those days seemed to be as incapable of thinking for themselves as what we see in much of the Right today--but among more the more technical, individualistic reader types.<br /><br />Pirsig, a technical writer for IBM with a genius-level IQ, recounts his journey on a motorcycle (he doesn't mention the brand; Wikipedia says it's a 1964 Honda Superhawk CB77) with his boy, Chris. They head out across the high plains thru Montana, then down the Oregon-California coast.<br /><br />The bulk of the story is Pirsig's first-person reflection of the trials of his alter ego, Phaedrus, who is first a college English teacher, then philosophical questioner who ventures to the would-be sources of all understanding. An ambitious project to be sure.<br /><br />Pirsig all the while is connecting the thinking of Phaedrus to Pirsig's own contemporary thinking on his journey through the mountains and plains of the Great Northwest. Pirsig uses the motorcycle as a metaphor for life: both the work it requires and the joy it can bring.<br /><br />The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in<br /><br />the circuits of a digital computer or the gears of a cycle<br /><br />transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the<br /><br />petals of a flower. -- Robert Pirsig<br /><br />The book alternates between Pirsig making an observation or working out some difficulty on the road--either with his motorcycle, the people he's with, or his son--and engaging some large philosophical issue the ancients have discussed, which is of profound importance to living our lives wisely today.<br /><br />I remember when I first read it, I was so enthralled with the insights of Phaedrus, in particular into the nature of Quality, that I skimmed passages where Pirsig discusses current reality. But take your time with these, too. Here's where the need for gumption lies.<br /><br />Phaedrus was so intense he runs into \\"problems.\\" I won't describe them here because realizing the connection between Phaedrus and the narrator (Pirsig) is one of the chief pleasures of discovery of reading ZAMM.<br /><br />...<br /><br />For my complete review of this book and for other book and movie<br /><br />reviews, please visit my site [...]<br /><br />Brian Wright<br /><br />Copyright 2007o \\"problems.\\" I won't describe them here because realizing the connection between Phaedrus and the narrator (Pirsig) is one of the chief pleasures of discovery of reading ZAMM.  <br /> <br />... <br /> <br />For my complete review of this book and for other book and movie <br />reviews, please visit my site [...] <br /> <br />Brian Wright <br />Copyright 2007

0694013889|2.0|I totally disagree that this book flows well (it 's actually very annoying to read, especially since you have to say \\"I, Prudence's Mother,...\\" about four times). But I do agree with the other reviewers who said the potty looks nothing like a child's potty. So unless you want to train your child to urinate in a flower vase or lemonade pitcher, it might be best to choose something else. I really like \\"The Potty Book\\" by Alyssa Satin Capucilli, and my daughter prefers it to \\"Prudence\\" as well.

0375815252|2.0|After reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to my 5 and 7 year olds, I got down my childhood copy of Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. It made for a terrible read aloud! The plot was slow, the dialogue boring and I had to edit out some racist parts about China and the Chinese. We all decided to abandon the read aloud after Chapter 5. Very disappointing! I was actually surprised to still find the book in print!
0743289412|1.0|Not going to waste much time writing about Lisey's Story. I throughly read the first 150 pages and then pretty much speed-read the rest of the book in 30 minutes. King's my favorite author and I would NEVER skip through one of his books, but as somebody else suggested, the writing at times is embarrassing. I really couldn't care less about Lisey and Scott's relationship and the silly words made it all that much more impossible for me to even care about the story (a loss, a dark threat, some drama, some secrets and a resolution). If this becomes a move, I'll gladly check it out, but the book was hardly worth the time I put into it (nor the $20 I'll never get back). \\"Bad-gunky\\" is probably the stupidest term I've ever read - and its used quite a bit, along with \\"Bool\\" (which I'm not sure I ever found out what it meant) \\"smucking\\" (instead of the F-word) and some other words - Lisey's Story just seemed like a pointless exercise. Also reduced the fascinating magic of a relationship to silly and childish sentiments. Kind of turned me off of reading Stephen King - which I guess never hurts - time to discover new authors! (Or time to reread IT - LOL!)
B000000Y2R|5.0|There are some pretty excellent reviews already written about this amazing recording (C. Craddock's in particular).  It is one of my top five favorite jazz CD's that I own and definitely my favorite 'live' recording.  I love hearing the applause of the audience after each solo.  These cats were simply the 'DREAM TEAM' of Jazz music - Dizzy, Bird, Bud Powell, Max Roach, and last but not least the incredible Charles Mingus on bass.<br /><br />From the moment the first song \\"Perdido\\" begins your heart starts pounding quickly with excitement and glee cause you just know you are in for some kind of magical journey.  I still can't believe the story about Bird and his borrowed horn (the infamous white, plastic alto).  Talk about turning chicken sh.. into chicken salad!  How in the hec does he play like that?!! Especially considering how much he was drinking and shooting up at the time.  According to Miles, it never mattered how f...ed up Bird was on booze and heroin, it seemed the more trashed he was, the better he played.  Go figure.<br /><br />I don't think any fan of jazz will be disappointed if they make this purchase.  It's difficult for me to comprehend how you could be a fan without this one in your collection.  This one is a no-brainer!
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|As a forty-something, it is great to hear a record that understands what rock and roll is . .. it's audacious, it's funny, it's energetic, it's the kind of record that Alice Cooper or Queen might make if they were still young, relevant and (at least in Freddy Mercury's case) alive.  \\"Teenagers\\" is worth the price of admission for me - - I haven't heard a better single this year.  If you like the power-rock of the late 70's (which I do, to a certain degree), and want to recapture a bit of your youth - - check this one out - - I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|A truly beautiful film!  I was mesmerized throughout by the great writing, directing, cinematography, and above all the outstanding performances of all the wonderful actresses.  One of the legendary grand dames of Spanish cinema Carmen Maura (the Judy Dench of Spain) gives a brilliant performance in a supporting role as Irene, the tortured matriarch trying to reconcile with her long, lost daughters.  Penelope Cruz gives a performance that in almost any other year would have reaped her not only the Academy Award for Best Actress, but every other award known to man-kind as well (however, having seen the movie \\"The Queen\\" it was no doubt Helen Mirren's year).  I have never seen Ms. Cruz even come close to being as great as she is in this fine film.  She is not only breathtakingly beautiful as our main heroine Raimunda (ala Sophia Loren and Anna Magnani) but she seems to glide across the screen with such balletic grace and effortlessness that you can't take your eyes off of her for a second.  The scenes between her and Maura in particular are simply sublime beyond words.  The other three main actresses also give outstanding performances in supporting roles - Yohana Cobo (Paula, Raimunda's teenage daughter), Blanca Portillo (Agustina), and in particular Lola Duenas (Sole, Raimunda's loyal and lonely younger sister).<br /><br />This is not a 'chick flick'.  This is not one of those boring, esoteric, foreign films that you need to be of European descent to truly understand and appreciate.  Pedro Almodar truly weaves together an absolutely wonderful story with a great message as well.  These women exude such strength and inner beauty that it is almost impossible to not empathize with each one of them.  I was pleasantly suprised when I walked out of the movie theatre and I am planning on purchasing this DVD soon.  Also, anyone who has been to Spain and fell in love with the people and culture (as I did) will truly love this film!  It is such an enchanting, charming land full of benevolent and passionate souls.<br /><br />It is definitely a five star movie in my opinion and one of the finest films of it's kind that I have seen in years.full of benevolent and passionate souls.   <br /> <br />It is definitely a five star movie in my opinion and one of the finest films of it's kind that I have seen in years.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|We found this movie to be quite enjoyable with an unexpected ending. The story had much humor, as well as some sadness. One got a glimpse of everyday Ukrainian life as a young man from NY went in search of his family's history in WW II and after.
0312983867|4.0|Janet E's Stephanie Plum series is one of my guilty reading pleasures.  I brought Hard Eight with me on a six hour flight and it entertained me the entire way (wish I could same the same of the airline...).  This particular offering doesn't really break any new ground - Stephanie is still the bad luck bounty hunter with an attraction for blown up cars and dangerous men.  The regular cast of characters is out in full force - Lula, Grandma Mazur, Joe Morelli, Ranger, and Cousin Vinnie - as Stephanie tries to find a missing woman and child on the run from a mobster and capture a few bond hearing deadbeats (always amusing).  The dialog is sarcastic and snappy, but in a few scenes it felt a bit overdone and contrived - no matter though, it's still an entertaining and fun read.  I always wondered why they haven't turned any of these stories into a film or TV series - it could really be a great combination of comedy and action/adventure.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I'm 49 years old and I was too young to appreciate \\"The Beatles\\" as a group when I was a kid. Thank God I matured into thinking (no, knowing)that they are and always will be the greatest rock & roll band ever!      I have had their music playing in my car (8-track, then cassette, then CD, now Ipod)since I got my drivers lic.in 1974. I Have never heard them sound soooo good as they do with this new CD. I can't wait till I get 5.1 surround sound so I can listen to the DVD.      I went to Vegas this last Oct. just to see the show. If you truly love their music you must see this show! It's really amazing!
0743496728|5.0|I was just looking for a good book to read at a bookstore one evening so I picked her book up.  I've never heard of this author let alone read any of her books.I was very surprised on how much I enjoyed this book. <br />I would recommend this book. <br />Good job! <br />
B000001ELL|3.0|This was the first KISS album I ever owned, my folks buying it for me as a youngster, so while I had heard other KISS songs on the radio and through friends who owned older KISS albums, I really didn't have the frame of mind that this was their \\"sell out\\" album. I simply enjoyed it for what it was - part musical exploration, part snapshot of its time. And my impressions have changed little since then. <br />Sure, \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\" was a \\"disco\\" song, but that cannot be said of the rest of the album. \\"Hard Pop\\" might be a better description, as the album still has a strong rhythmic rock underpinning, but is shaped by a production quality that shines with the sheen of a radio programmer's wetdream.  <br />Once passed the opening track, you get into the meat of some fine KISS tunes; \\"2000 Man\\", a cover of an obsure Stones' song, is reworked by Ace Frehley with amazing results, though the song is a tad lengthy. \\"Sure Know Something\\" contains one of Gene Simmons' best bass riffs, and would be a minor hit. Peter Criss checks in (or actually, checks out, due to drugs and a growing distaste for the music business) with \\"Dirty Livin'\\". The song is odd, but works. Sadly, this would be Criss' last track until the reunion album 20 years later, Psycho Circus. He also provided drums on this one track only, with Anton Fig (of Late Show with David Letterman fame) filling in on the rest of the disc. <br />\\"Charisma\\" (as well as \\"X-Ray Eyes\\") are typical, formulaic Simmons lyrics, but musically they work - he knew how to turn a phrase and the underlying \\"darkness\\" drives the tunes.  <br />\\"Magic Touch\\" is a hit or miss Paul Stanley tune, and is the one song of which my opinion has changed over the years -- I used to hate it, now I see it as a decent, interesting track. <br />In my mind, however, this album was elevated by Frehley's contributions - his two original tracks are two of his best, \\"Hard Times\\" being the B-side of the \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\" single, (and Ace'sbest track here), and \\"Save Your Love\\" being alluring, with an off-kilter arrangement for the chorus that still works. <br />My only disappointment is the fact that there are only 9 tracks here. Two more solid rockers and this would have been considered KISS' greatest discs. There is a lot of variety and attempts at exploring a more commercial sound, but there is also a very plain, grayness to some of the arrangements; they lack the fire, color, and spirit of earlier material. These reasons are what keep me from commiting to a 4 star rating. <br />Still, all in all, the album, marred by years of spite from older fans, deserves to be recognized on its own merits and seen for being better than you would think, and actually very enjoyable, after all these years.
0582435676|4.0|Finally, a novel that captures the effects that the; \\"Vietnam War experience\\" portrayed in pop culture entertainment media has had on some individuals. In this case a certain Richard -the protagonist- of Alex Garland's novel The Beach. I personally appreciated this as a twenty something who like Richard has grown up with too many movies, and video games in a world where wars could be seen on TV alongside soap operas, and sports.  <br />Hence he is told by an ambiguous and dead character named Daffy Duck somewhere deep in the novel that: \\"you wanted Vietnam\\" from his sought after beach experience.  <br /> <br />In Richard's case his Vietnam experience is getting lost with a French couple on a remote Thailand beach. Lost in a community with barely any contact with the outside world, near pot fields guarded by armed natives. The only meat around; fish, is to be fought for underwater, while there is an eternity of days and nights to bond with like minded individuals from all walks of life to reach the ultimate point of self-realisation in between essential daily tasks or details as it is called. Sound more fulfilling than your gap year? Not for Richard, as trouble is around the corner with the possibility of mass exposure of the beach due to his revealing of the map to some travelling pot heads back in Bangkok. And so what follows is a fast paced narrative about discovering something new and the lengths we will go through to protect it.  <br /> <br />The characters that are fleshed out are pretty believable, Jed, the mysterious watchman who has been somewhat casted out from the group,  Sal the unofficial, but strong leader, my favourite character in the book,  Keaty the dread locked Nintendo playing close mate of Rich, Bugs, the closest thing to Richards antagonist the other being the effects from experience itself, and Daffy Duck, the Scottish sounding sidekick to Richard who provides the map. A severely tense moment which I thought showed a lot of character was at onepoint in the story when a plan of escape was dependent upon the inevitable but slow death of a victim of a shark attack. The build up and setting was so tight to the point of captivity.  <br /> <br />I felt somewhat let down by the fact that the narrative is in first person though, as it indicated that Richard gets out in the end, but I guess the journey is in how. At the end I felt the author asking; \\"are we living at a time when the young and detached feel the need for personal Vietnams?\\" And can it be found among; gap year student plans, reality TV survival game shows, Ibiza club holidays, WTO protest camps, or enlisting for Iraq as avenues to lose or find oneself as Richard does? Maybe this is answered when Richard mentions his scars from the experience; \\"yeah i like how that sounds, ...I carry a lot of scars.\\" <br /> <br />Leyman

B000MNP2KI|3.0|This has a few of the reference points that assure you that you're watching a Bond film: the Aston Martin, 'M', the exotic locations and the girls. But as others have said, there's no Moneypenny or Q, and not many gadgets besides a mobile phone obsession -- Sony Ericsson must have paid a fortune for the repeated product placement.<br /><br />But it's in the changing pace of the movie that it feels least like a Bond film: e.g. the mundane toilet killing that kicks the film off, the rather slow recovery sequence leading up to the building collapse in Venice.<br /><br />The worst aspect of this film is the way it tries to ape '24' -- far too much torture, and little sexual content. The theme song sung by Chris Cornell is also bitterly disappointing. (It must now be more than 10 years since a Bond song zoomed up the UK pop charts.)<br /><br />The best aspects of this film are the opening credits (there's even a witty Mandelbrot reference), Daniel Craig throughout, and the staccato end. The movie also a serious, realistic tone lacking in the Roger Moore and Brosnan eras; you finish watching the movie feeling that not all ends have been neatly tied up. It's more like real life.<br /><br />Craig deserved his Bafta nomination. I strongly suspect that the movie largely got its Bafta nomination because the year is 2 007. The movie/DVD is recommended, but not outstanding.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Like many, I was skeptical of Daniel Craig as Bond.  Boy, was I wrong.  This is one of the BEST BOND FILMS EVER!  He's terrific, the plot is good, the actions sequences are amazing and all the actors are excellent.  Go, you'll like it.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|I am sorry to say that I was slightly disappointed with this adaptation of one of my best Jane Austen's novels. I heard so much praise of it so I was really excited to see it. But we all have different sensibilities and for me, the adaptation didn't manage to reproduce Anne's inner world and the depth of the love between Anne and Wentworth.  <br />For me, the beauty of the book relies on the tension between Anne and Wentworth and on the looks that they can't help exchanging despite their long time of separation and despite Wentworth's resentment. Eight years ago, although Anne fell deeply in love with Wentworth, she was persuaded by her father and her deceased mother's friend to refuse his proposal, on account of Anne being too young and of Wentworth's lack of fortune. The story starts when Captain Wentworth returns to the country from the war with the intention of living peacefully and of finding a wife. They are to meet again unexpectedly as Anne's father, Sir Walter, is a heavy spender and the family has to let the family house, Kellynch Hall, to the Crofts who are closely related to Wentworth.  <br />This love-story is really wonderful as it is all about undying love and about meeting again the person that you fell in love with so many years ago and in the case of Wentworth, meeting the woman you loved but broke your heart by rejecting you...These questions are still relevant today and that is what makes this story so original. Not only, Austen manages to create an incredible tension between Wentworth and Anne but also to describe to the perfection Anne's feelings of sadness, of solitude, of regret, of distress at seeing Wentworth for the first time.  <br />But somehow, I didn't see any of that tension in the BBC film or Anne's real suffering. I am sorry to say so but I was not convinced by Amanda Root's performance as Anne Elliot. And it is not merely because she seems a little too old for the part, it is just that her face didn't display any emotion. I am probably shallow, but I need to see on the actress's face that Anne is very much affected by Wentworth's return. Unfortunately, I didn't feel any connections to this Anne. I really couldn't relate to her. I was not overwhelmed by the adaptation. I just watched it but I didn't feel the incredible urge to watch it again as I have felt for other period dramas like BBC North&South or BBC Pride &Prejudice.  <br />However, I put three stars because I thought that Ciaran Hinds was rather good in the part of Wentworth and I liked the settings for the film. I have watched the 1995 version only once and I will try to make the effort and watch it once more. But I've seen the 2007 ITV adaptation and in my heart, this one has already met my expectations. Even though it is not as faithful to the book as the 1995 one and despite the poor performances of some actors, the 2007 version has blown me away, simply because Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones are perfect in the parts of Anne Elliot and of Captain Wentworth!!!  <br /> This BBC version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds is not a bad film in itself. But it is just not 'my' adaptation of the book. Just see it for yourself and maybe you will be 'persuaded' by it.   <br />
1400049628|4.0|After enjoying [[ASIN:0307346609 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]], I decided to try this book since it was the only other book that the author had written.  Potential readers should be aware that these books are quite different in every way.  This one is written as a true survival guide.  The subject matter is limited to what you might find in a genuine guide and the tone is very dry and factual.  The illustrations are very crude.  I have seen some reviewers criticize the drawings, by the way, and believe that they miss the point.  Guides of this sort would typically be done on a shoestring budget and would not have lavish art.  The crude drawings only add to the authenticity of the illusion that the  author is attempting to build.  In short, this book mimics what you might expect to find in a genuine survival guide in every way that matters.    The question, then, is whether you have a desire to wade through a lengthy treatise on surviving zombie attacks written in a dry, factual style.  It's obvious from the reviews that a lot of people enjoyed the experience immensely.  Originally, I wasn't going to buy this book because I wasn't interested in the subject but relented after enjoying World War Z so much.  That was my mistake.  Regardless of how well written it is, I simply wasn't interested enough in the material to make this a compelling read.      In terms of rating the book, I am giving it four stars because I recognize the quality of the product.  It's my own fault that I bought a book that was not of great interest to me and I don't think it's fair to dock the book because of that.  I strongly suggest that people trying to decide whether or not to read this title consider that point for themselves and buy (or not) accordingly.
0800141660|5.0|I am saying this because a new BBC Sense&Sensibility is being filmed right now and I must say, the actress who takes up the part of Marianne after Kate Winslet has a hard job ahead of her! I was really blown away by her performance and her portrayal of the passionate, idealistic and beautiful Marianne! She was so convincing in her role that Marianne has become one of my favourite heroines by Jane Austen after Elizabeth Bennet and Anne Elliot!  <br /> <br />'to die for love, what could be more glorious than that?!' This is what Marianne says to her mother very early in the movie. And with this statement, Marianne already gives a glimpse of the passionate side of her character, how far she can go for love, to win the heart of the dashing Willoughby. But this statement also raises some important question about the meaning of true love? 'Is love a fancy or a feeling?' Is it better to love like Marianne intensely, passionately and to be so blinded by it that you don't even see the flaws of the person that you love? Doesn't passionate love involve some pain sometimes? The film gives us some answers implicitly and it is up to you to see if the answer is to your liking.  <br /> <br />Kate Winslet is surrounded by an impressive cast, Allan Rickman (what a man!!!, great performance and his intense looks towards Marianne!) as Colonel Brandon, Emma Thompson as Elinor, Greg Wise (I think) as Willoughby (the ultimate heartbreaker, he embodies the tall-dark-handsome womanizer to the perfection) and Hugh Grant (not spectacular but still worth it). Nothing bad to say about all these wonderful actors. They know their job. Plus, they are in a Ang Lee film...Ang Lee`s filming technique (Brokeback Mountain) is seen again throughout this adaptation, in the camera long shots of the actors, horse- riding or walking in the countryside, in the setting too.. <br /> <br />I just have one more thing to add, E. Thompson's screenplay is brilliant, she has managed to give a sexy, very manly touchto the male characters. Sense &Sensibility is a wonderful adaptation that you can see again and again with still the same pleasure. Don't miss it if you haven't seen it yet.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|The camera crew must have been drunk.  Impossible to watch without getting queasy.  Slow, slow moving plot and tons of worthless scenes (all the while moving the camera with what must have been a horrid hangover)- save yourself 2 hours and just read a one sentence review.   <br /> <br />Sucks, sucks, SUCKS BADLY.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I love this quote and the metaphor of the twin birds because it perfectly describes the beauty, the depth of the love between Jane Eyre and Rochester, this love that is magnified by the two charismatic actors, Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson.  <br />I never felt before any particular interest in this love-story but now that I've seen this brilliant adaptation, I even want to read the book again and to pay much more attention to the love-story between, a rather plain but intelligent governess and her master, Mr Rochester. Even Jane Eyre' s childhood is dealt with (quickly, I grant you, but dealt with nonetheless) in the film, her dreams and her terrible childhood with the Reeds first and then at Lowood school.  <br />I think no one better than Ruth Wilson could embody Jane Eyre with passion, sadness,   great strength and acuteness. She is perfect in the part but Toby Stephens as Mr Rochester is the one who really blow me away. His performance is simply fantastic and even if Mr Rochester is not my favourite character, I can't help being impressed by the actor's performance. He brings charm and humour to the dark, impassioned character.   He is definitely `thud-worthy' as C19 members would say! The two actors are supported by a superb casting, (Christina Cole performs very well the part of Blanche Ingram, Francesca Amis tends to annoy me a little but simply because she has the part of a cold, hateful character, Mrs Ingram, so in a way, Amis succeeds very well there, Lorraine Ashbourne, Andrew Buchan and the little Tara Fitzgerald are worth mentioning).  <br />The dialogues have been a little changed but they are still following the spirit of the book; They are simply mesmerizing and with the talent of the actors it is with deep interest that you listen to Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester's conversations and passionate scenes.  <br />The chemistry between the actors is the great force of this adaptation and there is such sexual tension between Jane Eyre and Rochester that somescenes really makes me blush... The photography is very good, the landscapes and the Derbyshire moors are spectacular (I was pretty excited to notice that they used Haddon Hall as the setting for Thornfield as I visited Haddon Hall and went to that part of Derbyshire not so long ago!)And I love the music as well (with oriental notes). But I love the outdoor scenes when there are some long pauses between the lead actors; These are delicious silences too!!!  <br />I can't find any flaws in this adaptation. It is perfect in every way even if, for me, it may not be as 'overwhelming' as North and South (screenplay written by the same person, Sandy Welsh) partly because I still prefer Thornton (Richard Armitage) to Rochester. In any case, it is probably one of the best period drama I've ever seen!!! <br />
B000E41MS6|4.0|Wow, it's wonderful to finally know what goes on behind the scenes.  The first disk is a \\"behind the scenes\\" tour of how this show is produced.  How all the aliens are invented & created in a 3-d manner.
B000NDIAWO|5.0|When I first reviewed this CD. I didn't fully understand Where Beyonce was coming from as an artist. But,now with the release of B-Day I now have a better understanding of What B-Day is all about. Which is female empowerment. The duet with Shakira was a song that needed to be said and sung,which is call \\"Beauitful Liar\\". The reason I say this is beause I'am tried of seeing yong ladies fight over gentlemen Who can care less about them and more about there precious male male ego. Other then, the lyrics of the song. I enjoy the latin rhythm as well as the middle easten sound to the song. For the song \\"Irreplaceable\\" is petty much speaks for itself that you can be replace. To me the song \\"up Grade U\\" is about making each other better not only in life but,also in business as well.    \\"Freakum Dress\\" I think as I sad before, we ladies all have that dress that makes us feel good ultimetly sexy. \\"Suga Mama\\" is What I like to call that fantasy song . \\"Green Light\\" Is given that gentlemen or lady permission to leave the relationship if they are uphappy in anyway. For the track \\"Listen\\" it's about finding your voice from with in after you,ve been told you didn't neecessary have a voice in the beging ,but now you some how found the strength from within to say. I have a voice and What I think and say matter. I'am not going to lie to you lovely people I had no idea What \\"Get Me Bodied meant until Ms. Knowles explained it. Which means out doing your dance partner, with your dance moves, on the dance floor.     The song I'am about to tell you  is a song I absolutely love with out a doubt. Whch is called \\"Flaws& All\\" to me this song is worth buying the album period,if only for this song. Not only are the lyrics beauitful ,but the melody is incredible. I love Beyonce's opera Inflence vocals. If you are a person Who enjoys singing Beyonce will for sure challenge you vocally. \\"Welcome To Hollywood\\" talks about the down fall of this industry. \\"Still In Love\\"(Kissing you) is a song expressing that ultimetly love for someone. \\"Deja\\" is a song about, I guess a man or women who catches your eye. \\"Kitty Kat\\" for me is a song about feeling physically neglected. \\"Resentment\\" is about that women that put up with eveything over years and knew in your heart of hearts What was going on,but you didn't want face it. Because you think he'll change. \\"Ring The Alarm\\" is about for me at least being angry at your ex for doing stuff you thought were special ,but now is being shared with someone else along with a little jealousy. \\"World Wide Women\\" is a hidden track basically talking about she's all over the place.
B000MXPE88|1.0|I'd love to rate this high because it looked fascinating from the reviews, but I can't watch it - it will not play in the Xbox HD player which I use.  The player cannot recognize the disc.  I'd blame the player except the other 20+ HD movies I've watched on it work just fine.  Poor quality disc production I guess.  Anyway, if you've got an Xbox player, perhaps wait until the release a new version of this disc.

B00003CXV4|5.0|When I saw this movie, I was not a fan of Reeves, and I only knew Theron by name. I had never seen her performances before. As I happened upon this movie on cable one night, just as it started, The first 30 minutes, I sat through with a cocked eyebrow, watching Reeves weave his character, Nelson Moss, into life. Then along came Theron, as the quirky, mysterious, wise beyond her years, captivating, and poignant Sara Deever, and after that, I was hooked.  <br />Truly, as it is infamously told in the reviews, the last act of the film, to it's end was absolutly heartwrenching. I was just starstruck by Charlize Theron's character in this movie, her performance, everything. I also found that this is actually a REMAKE of the original from the 50's with Sandra Dee. I've yet to see it, but it peaked my interest. Although I doubt it would hold a candle to this version. I am now a starstruck fan of Theron's, and have since obsessively seen every one of her performances since. This is a MUST SEE.
0399226907|4.0|I bought this book in Chinese and English, it teaches many concepts at once. Pictures are great, counting and language learning is excellent.
6305079900|5.0|One of my absoulute FAVORITE movies. I was literally dragged into the theater by my friends, who insisted I HAD to see it, and after 10 min. into it, I didn't blink for the next 2 hours. I've seen this movie over 100 times since, and have yet to tire of it. The sequel is equally fantastic, (see the Special Ed. with the additional footage), but the third left me disappointed. <br />Truly a marvel of storytelling. James Cameron proves his skills as a director and writer, in this masterpiece of 1984. Who would think, he would become one of the greatest directors of all time afterwords?

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|It's refreshing to hear at least one new band that recognizes where the real power of heavy rock was birthed and joyfully mixes snippets of Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd and too many others to identify on first listen into a sound that becomes their own.<br /><br />  Andrew Stockdale is very reminiscent of a young Ozzy or Robert Plant, sometimes at the same time, and his guitars slam and shimmer with equal ease.  Most impressive is \\"Woman\\", the third cut that dares you not to fracture your skull playing air guitar along with the simple but titanic riff.  Ditto for \\"Pyramid\\" that somehow crosses \\"Paranoid\\"-era Sabbath with Floyd's \\"Astronomy Domine\\".  Kinda like if Syd Barrett had fronted Sabbath.<br /><br />  Despite the obvious comparisons and influences, \\"Wolfmother\\" stands on its own merits as one of the best debut rock albums of recent memory.  This promising set hopefully will repeat itself with a great follow-up soon.  Fans of Queens of the Stone Age must check these guys out, although I imagine most of them already have.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|I am a real fan of matt damon but this was not a good shepherd of my movie dollars.

B0000027RL|5.0|I remember when this album was first released - I was 12 years old, and just really starting to get heavily into music.  My real captivation with grunge started with Nirvana - I saw the music video for \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" and was just captivated - it was a far cry from the music that had been extremely popular in the late eighties (songs like \\"She Drives Me Crazy\\" by Fine Young Cannibals, for example).  Then, here comes Pearl Jam, with a very different sound than Nirvana (more influenced by classic rock than punk), but  an equally invigorating and new one.  This album was just HUGE in its time, and the main hits (\\"Even Flow,\\" \\"Alive,\\" and \\"Jeremy\\") were played EVERYWHERE.  Even if you were a fan of Pearl Jam, it was pretty hard not to get tired of them as this album continued to sell in massive quantities all through the nineties.   <br /> <br />In retrospect, it was truly an important album that helped shape an entire decade of music, and ushered in a truly legendary (albeit brief) era.  Grunge.  All of a sudden, sounding original and being musically talented were in style, and \\"Ten\\" is one of the key albums that paved the way for nearly all of the now legendary bands of the 90's (such as Radiohead and The Smashing Pumpkins). <br /> <br />And, musically, it truly holds up over time, because Pearl Jam are a band that are truly talented.  The time in which \\"Ten\\" was released may have helped catapult them to the top of the charts, but their artistry is what has kept them there throughout their career.  Listening to \\"Ten\\" now is actually more enjoyable for me than it was, say, ten years ago when I'd heard it so many times I knew every word.  <br /> <br />Recommended strongly to any fan of rock music.

014017821X|5.0|Angela Carter is a superb author with a vivid and utterly compelling style. Her short stories are graphic, sexy, and page-turning. She doesn't disappoint! If you loved fairytales as a child but need that little something extra now that your older and wiser then you simply must read this book!
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|First of all, STOP MAKING IT SEEM LIKE HAYLEY IS THE ONLY REASON THE BAND IS SUCCESSFUL! Yes, she's gorgeous and she has a great voice, but josh and she write the songs together, zac is a passionate drum player, jeremy rocks on bass and Josh is an amazing guitar player. <br /> <br />This album may not be the best in the world, but it's worth buying. It's the first album made by a young band, with another one coming out on June 12 (WHICH I CANNOT WAIT FOR!!) <br /> <br />Many of the songs do have the same sound, but the lyrics and drums really set them apart from each other. My favorite tracks are Franklin and My Heart.  <br /> <br />And some of you complain 'oh, they just entered the emo scene' when that's not it at all. They've specifically asked for people to NOT call them emo, and they really do try to set themselves apart from other bands. <br /> <br /> <br />For instance, if you listened to their new single off of RIOT! (the album coming out on june 12)called Born For This, you'd be amazed at how different they sound. They try to give as much as they can to their fans, six of them helping with the back up vocals in this song. <br />Heck, they even hired a mariachi band for one of their songs, and THAT'S stepping out of the box.  <br /> <br />These four people are definitely getting somewhere, and I would highly suggest buying this album, along with the Summer Tic EP and RIOT!

B000K7VHQE|4.0|Everyone has a dream.  A project by which they define themselves, their self-esteem, and as Ernest Becker would have it, deny death.  This movie takes that concept to illogical, entertaining, and heart-warming extremes.  Not to mention the wonderful acting.
B00005JPMC|3.0|Surprisingly, for an elaborately staged revenge action piece, this 2007 movie is too politically ambitious for its own good. Director Antoine Fuqua knows how to stage an over-the-top battle and a desperate chase scene with plenty of eye-popping firepower and expert stunt work, but along with screenwriter Jonathan Lemkin, he also wants to make the story a topical commentary on the current political landscape. They are caught in cross purposes that don't mesh well at all, especially toward the end, because the movie is basically a man-on-the-run B-picture with an A-picture budget.<br /><br />Based on \\"Point of Impact\\", a suspense novel by Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter, the densely plotted story focuses on the aptly named Bobby Lee Swagger, a former military sniper who happens to be one of the most expert marksmen ever. Abandoned by the U.S. military during a deadly secret mission in Ethiopia, he has since become a mountain-man survivalist who is recruited three years later by a shadowy figure, Col. Isaac Johnson, to help prevent a predicted assassination attempt on the President. A sudden, Hiitcockian twist occurs a little over the half-hour mark, and the rest of the movie is a series of convolutions that spiral completely out of control by the overblown series of finales.<br /><br />All of this may have had a chance for resonance if the characters were developed beyond the level of action figures. Looking seriously self-possessed, Mark Wahlberg does his best to make Swagger a more dimensional character than the Rambo-constrained script demands, but the film doesn't give him much breathing room beyond his angst over his spotter's death and his burgeoning anger at the U.S. government. On the latter point, he suddenly articulates his perspective like a McLaughlin Group commentator, one of many laughable elements that seem to multiply once Swagger takes charge of his mission of vengeance. As the initially reluctant FBI agent who searches for the truth, Michael Pe&ntilde;a brings mush needed humanism to the story, but his character's arc is absurdly presented in broad strokes.<br /><br />With a convincing Kentucky accent, Kate Mara looks at first to be playing the spotter's widow as a feisty, vulnerable figure, but she is reduced almost systematically to a nearly mute damsel-in-distress as the story progresses. Similarly, Danny Glover plays Johnson with some interesting texture at the beginning but then quickly moves into Simon Legree territory. The worst casting occurs late in the movie with Ned Beatty as a pompous U.S. senator pivotal in the political conspiracy behind Swagger's set-up. A far cry from the Machiavellian corporate tycoon he played in \\"Network\\", Beatty plays to the rafters with zero subtlety. Still, it is hard not to be impressed with the film's technical aspects, particularly the sharp cinematography of Peter Menzies, Jr. and the propulsive editing by Conrad Buff and Eric Sears. Lemkin's polemic-heavy script, however, cannot begin to elevate the movie beyond its testosterone-driven genre.ichael Peña brings mush needed humanism to the story, but his character's arc is absurdly presented in broad strokes. <br /> <br />With a convincing Kentucky accent, Kate Mara looks at first to be playing the spotter's widow as a feisty, vulnerable figure, but she is reduced almost systematically to a nearly mute damsel-in-distress as the story progresses.

B000KWZ7VU|5.0|It is truly unbelievable what Daniel Barenboim did in the lapse of three weeks in these 8 concerts given in Berlin in 2005, what a precious gift to be able to watch these superb performances of the complete Beethoven 32 Piano Sonatas in wonderful sound and image and a really beautiful camera work, it takes more than eleven hours to play them all, Daniel Barenboim is an extraordinary musical genius, not to mention the superb quality of his playing and the fact that he didn't even read a single note.<br />I really didn't know Daniel Barenboim is such a fantastic pianist, his playing in this set is simply unsurpassable, he shows a deep feeling and connection with this music, his understanding of the music and the piano in particular is totally amazing and that is completely reflected in the unique way he plays, he is never boring, his interpretations are so vivid, each phrase played with such care and passion, his musicality and expressiveness are outstanding, and his technic is absolutely of the highest level, truly astonishing, it was like the piano was actually singing all the time.<br />This whole set is a magnificent masterclass, truly in the same league with the greatest masters of the piano ever.<br />The format of the film is widescreen and for the audio we have the option of Dolby Digital 5.0 Surround for optimal sound.<br />So if you love the piano and feel passion for it do not miss these magnificent, spellbinding, breathtaking and electrifying performances beautifully captured on film.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Although I was not around during his peak of popularity, I am a huge fan of Bing Crosby. The first album I ever personally bought was a cassette of Bing Crosby's Christmas songs, and my respect for Bing carries over into this wonderful classic as he showcases both his acting and his singing. <br /> <br />This is one of those wholesome films that captures your heart right from the start. The characters are easy to relate to and the musical score that accompanies this is excellent. There is nothing vulgar about the film at all, making it a top pick for family viewing (or for any type of viewing, for that matter--who needs the awful junk that makes up 95% of Hollywood's output today?) <br /> <br />The film brings feelings of nostalgia to me despite the fact I am significantly younger than the film. It makes me feel as if I am a few years younger and makes me remember the Christmases of years past, all of which have their own special memories. They are vintage wine--the oldest ones get even better with age--and the movie is the glass to hold that metaphorical wine. I just watched it for the first time last Christmas but plan to make it a tradition. However, I should note that the movie is good at any time of the year--after all, there are other holidays featured in this film!
B00000612P|5.0|yes children, there was once a time when rod stewart made good albums. even a great one. this is the great one. great rock and roll numbers. beautiful ballads. music with soul. listen to \\"mandolin wind,\\" for instance. that's great stuff. so is the title track and \\"tomorrow is a long time.\\" and hear what he does with the tim hardin classic, \\"reason to believe.\\" that's certainly great. \\"maggie may,\\" you may even have heard this on the oldies station. fine tune, isn't it? lots of excellent guitar on this album, as well. ron wood, who would soon become a rolling stone, plays here; and the boy sure has a feel for rock and roll. somebody needs to get ahold of mr stewart and make him listen to this album. couldn't he do something like this again? just for his old fans. maybe rick rubin could slap him upside the head and talk some sense into the old geezer. anyway, children, this is how it was, back even before the days of disco. those were good times. oh, nostalgia.
B00005JPO8|5.0|Winner of the 2007 Oscar for best foreign language film, \\"The Lives of Others\\" (Das Leben der Anderen)\\" deserve every word of praise. You may watch this riveting German film as thriller, romance or a glimpse of history about East Germany, or DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) and its Staatssicherheit, or \\"Stasi,\\" the secret police and intelligent office that monitored \\"The Lives of Others.\\" I promise whatever your expectation will be fully rewarded in the end. <br /> <br />The film opens with the lecture of Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), able interrogator of Stasi, demonstrating before the astonished students how he does 48 hours of chilling questioning as if nothing happened. Then Wiesler is assigned to a new mission, around-the-clock surveillance of internationally famous dramatist Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his girlfriend and acclaimed actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). His job this time, however, involved knowing \\"The Lives of Others\\" - others in this case meaning the people behind Berlin Wall. <br /> <br />\\"The Lives of Others\\" offers the multi-layered worlds of characters and their relations, which are bolstered by the intelligent script and the strong acting, but there's more to the intriguing complexity of the story. The thrills and suspense of the film is enhanced as the character we relate to undergo changes, which represents something dangerous in the strictly monitored society where status quo is the ultimate goal. <br /> <br />You may think the coda of the film is unnecessary. Otherwise, \\"The Lives of Others\\" is perfect with first-time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's sure-handed storytelling that has no let-up. The film is a bit long (137 minutes), but watching experience is more than rewarding, especially when you realize that there is no `big actions' used in the story to maintain the emotional tension throughout.

B000NA2776|5.0|This album is simply amazing. Mika's vocals are literally breathtaking, and he has a superb falsetto. A lot of people have compared him to Freddy Mercury, which is true, but he has a style that is all his own. And all of the songs are so catchy!

0385474547|5.0|This book merges the African spirit of Alexander McCall Smith (\\"Lady's Detective Agency\\" series)with the prophetic rhapsody of Paolo Coelho (\\"The Alchemist\\") or  Yann Martel(\\"Life of Pi\\"). But, unlike the other books, this twists and turns you through a tangled web of the seemingly simple African natives (and their beliefs) and the white man's interpretation and treatment of the same when confronted by \\"progress.\\"<br /><br />Okonkwo, the main character  --  whose manliness would be a leader in a hunter/gatherer world, or in the world of his farming land for annual survival --  is someone you admire and dislike.  His strength is his weakness.  He physicality conquers all challenges delivered to him.  But, coming with his masculine heroics is a personality which commonly beats his spouse(s) and children.<br /><br />His \\"heathen culture's\\" worshipping of many gods and honoring men with polygamist rewards may appear unforgivable to some - especially conservative Christian moralists.  But, as this book succinctly and proficiently explains in narrative fashion how these people honor and worship their social mores, an anthropological analysis compels us to understand that these people hold the basic Judeo-Christian ethic, and have a strong justiciable system which actually surpasses many of those in our own \\"civilized\\" society.<br /><br />The \\"golden rule\\" is the glue in which the village controls the behavior and morals of the inhabitants. The greatest example is the accidental death of a boy caused by the protagonist. Trial? No need. Blame? Not really. Penalty? Absolutely. Seven years of exile from the tribal clan - even though all understand he was not at fault.  While gone, friends tilled his land and delivered his land's profits to he and tenant farmers.  Amount of time for this application of justice: two days.  And,  we have always been taught that our civilized society depicts justiciable efficiency. In contrast, a British judicial ceremony involves the protagonist being heisted and hoodwinked by surreptitious deceit.<br /><br />This book awakened an understanding of the tribe better than any other novel that I have read.

B000MZHW40|5.0|So, next time my wife insists that she wants a bigger diamond I will remind her of this story and why we shouldn't buy it. It's a win-win deal between the African people and myself.<br /><br />Somewhere in the film it's mentioned that 15% of the diamond business is out of 'conflict'. Does this mean the remaining 85% of the business is coming out of completely invaded and decimated lands that there is no longer any conflict there?<br /><br />This movie probably displays Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance; even better than the DiParted. While the diamond that is the center of attention in the story is priced at two million Dollars and a safe return of a family, that DiCaprio and Jennifer Connelly never kiss is priceless.<br /><br />Perhaps the most poignant part of this story is the parent-child love triumph over the influence of corruption...while there is still a chance.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban's third album does not even come close to his first two. There are a few good songs on it but it's much more mainstream and experimental at the same time. A new artist has their whole life to put into a first album, a good one will have two in them, however it's the third one that will make or break them. I'll be more cautious to listen to the fourth album before I buy it. Josh needs to be very choosy about what he sings from now on. If he can come back from a bad third album with a terrific fourth album he'll be cemented in the pantheon of great singers of the late 20th Century as well as the 21st! I hope he does it, it's so nice to hear a well trained voice with a great song! This is something all too rare, his producers and A&R guys need to be working double time to find him the right material. Obviously they were sleeping the last time.
B000NHPCS0|5.0|I absolutely loved this film....It was one of those rare cinematic occasions when I sat through the entire two & a half hours without getting up once. It is a spellbinding tale of Corruption, Deceit and Murder, set in the heart of Boston's underbelly. If you like Jack Nicholson...your in for a feast, this could possibly be his best performance since \\"The Shining\\". I do want to warn you however, If your someone who is offended by course language...STEER CLEAR, this film has the F-word throughout and also an ample helping of brutal violence...All of which, however adds to the realism of the story. Also starring Leonardo Dicaprio (In His Best Role Since \\"Titanic\\"), Matt Damon, Mark Walhberg, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen.....And directed by the legendary Martin Scorcese. This is one film that will blow you away. A definate must have for any movie lover.
0345347951|5.0|To start off, I think this book is a masterpiece of ideas and science fiction. That said, I'll begin by mentioning what I see as my one significant squabble with the book.<br /><br />Clarke posits an ultimate destiny of man where we find all our childish squabbles, essentially every bit of struggling and conflict we undertake, is abandoned as childish for something much larger-- namely, the energies of a far more powerful, incromprehensible [to us] universe. This is the premise, and he carries it out winningly. But there is a key few pages, a crucial scene, where the overlord we come to know best, Karellan, shows remorse for only being a mechanism of that higher energy in the universe, and not having the ever-yearning passion of humanity. This, to me, seemed to need some more reconciliation, or development, in the face of his very ambitious hypothetical of man's existential leap into a hive being of the universe, an ultimately powerful creature/being.<br /><br />That said, this novel is a landmark, and delivers brilliantly. From beginning to end, his words intrigue you and keep you reading, and ideas litter the chapters. He manages one of the difficult tasks of huge-idea science fiction, bringing the entire story of the human race, and even their interaction with an alien race, onto the scale of a real story. That is, he shows the fate of humanity from the perspective of a tale and thus we remain interested and are astounded at the fate of humans.<br /><br />So far as books go in terms of ideas, Childhood's End is one of the best. It is more glaring than many novels, at the end, that we are left without answers, but this is a characteristic of literature and of really anything short of hard science which, in itself, relies on the presumptions of sensory experience. Thus it may leave you a bit unsatisfied, but who among any of us can provide truer answers than the most we currently know from recent quantum mechanics articles, or string theory experiments?<br /><br />So, if you'd like to be amazed by a sojourn of man into one potential way which the universe may turn out for us, sit down and crack this open- you won't be disappointed.y a sojourn of man into one potential way which the universe may turn out for us, sit down and crack this open- you won't be disappointed.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|The first thing you see when you go to buy The Good Shepherd is that it's being hailed as \\"The Godfather of CIA Movies.\\"  Big boast, right?  Does it step up to the level of The Godfather as a classic movie?  Robert DeNiro directs and stars, Matt Damon, Angelin Jolie, Alec Baldwin, William Hurt and the list of supportng castmates goes on.  At two hours and forty-eight minutes it's definitely got epic written all over it.  Well...<br /><br />I look at good long movies like this: if I start to squirm in my seat, it's too long for it's own good.  If I don't even notice the extended length, it's a damn good.<br /><br />I squirmed.<br />Sorry.<br /><br />The Good Shepherd is the story of Edward Wilson, a Yale graduate and all around good guy who happens to belong the the Skull & Bones Society. Neat little upper class cult that it is,  like Frat Boys meets The Illuminati.  Creepy.  Edward witnessed his father's suicide at the age of six and actualy stole the suicide note before anyone got there.  He confesses this while lying naked in a sarcophigi surrounded by his hooded, black-cloaked Skull & Bones brethren. Okay...  Hitler is rising in Europe and even though America is still firmly out of the conflict, the OSS decides it's time to start doing things to keep the U.S. in the game without being directly involved.  The CIA is born.  Counterintelligence.  Spies.  Networks.  The whole nine yards and Edward Wilson is right there from the beginning, traveling to Europe for six years, leaving behid a wife (Jolie) he barely knows and a son yet-to-be-born.<br /><br />The human side of The Good Shepherd is interesting.  Edward fel in love with a deaf girl named Laura and had planned to be with her always, but during a little Skull & Bones reunion, he is taken into the woods by a Senator' daughter and seduced.  She gets pregnant.  He marries her.  So long Laura.  Damn.  We see the rise and fall of Edward Wilson not only as a spy, a counterintelligence agent for the newly spawned CIA, but as a human being.  His morales are tested. His allegiance, too.  His trust in others is absolutely extinguished.  He winds up having hs son's pegnant fiance thrown from an airplane on her way to their wedding because she was working for the KGB.  Nice.<br /><br />Overall, The Good Shepherd is a good movie sharing time between the year leading up to WWII and the faled CIA-sponsored rebellion against Cuba's Castro at the beginning of The Cold War.  De Niro directs masterfully and the cast is well-rounded.  But...I still squirmed and that means that something was lacking.  When you bring up a movie like The Godfather and then compare it, no matter how casually, there is bound to be problems. The Good Shepherd had too many slow spots where a good editing by De Niro might have made it better.  Still a good movie.  I would definitely watch it again, but not too soon.  It may take a while to digest it, perhaps nurtue a fondness for it. Could you spend your money more wisely?  Maybe.  But there aren't too many flick coimng out of this caliber, however, so make your choice.  You should not be too disappointed.<br /><br />Dig it.are tested. His allegiance, too.

B000AWYOGE|3.0|Dark Water is  remake from a Japanese film from years back.  They don't really tote that around, but the movie buffsa will know it.  And being how it isn't original, that is where it comes up lacking.  First off, they push Dark Water at you like it's The Ring or The Grudge or one of those new-fangled hack-slash-scare-and-scream bits of tripe that have been spewing out of the gullet of Hollywood for the past few years.  The New Breed of Horror Flicks.  Well...  The first thing you will realize is that Dark Wateris not scary at all.  I didn't even flinch once.  But once you get past the preconceived notion that you're supposed to be afraid or grossed out or whatever, you realize that Dark Water is actually a pretty good movie.  Filled with dark amosphere and creepy settings, this is definitely not one of those semi-retarded ultra-gore Saw movies.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly is a recently divorced single mother with past mental issues who finds a place to live in the most god-awfully creepy tenemant in New York.  This place looks like Attica prison turned into condos.  Seriously.  She and her small daughter take an apartment on the ninth floor and everything seems to be going fine.  New school for the daughter.  New job for the mom.  The occasional spat between ex-husband & ex-wife.  And then the leaks begin.<br /><br />This movie is the most straight-forward ghost story you will ever see and when you realize where the story is going, you'll slap yourself in the head.  Duh!  But it does have  freaky ending and that's cool.  Not overly gory.  I like that.  Not that gore bothers me.  When it's used gratuitously for no pupose other than shock-value, that's f*cking irritating.  Definitely a flick worth seeing.  Wouldn't pay full-price for it because it's pretty predictable.  But it's a good mid-range suspense ride.  When you watch the dark, creeping, oozing dark water slittering down from the ceiling, you will cringe.  That's movie atmosphere at it's best.<br /><br />Dig it.it.
0743289412|5.0|I am a little surprised by the bad reviews here. Maybe that's because I never read a Stephen King book before and find this one quite remarkably good. Maybe his normal standard is so totally different that his habituados are frustrated?<br />Some review are complaining that this is 'just a love story'. Well, if you review a book, you better read it, unless you want egg in your face. This is definitely a love story, but also a lot more.<br />People are bitching about the slowness of the story or about the strangeness of the language. Strange language is needed for strange worlds.<br />There is good and bad writing. Among the good writing, there is 'realistic' writing and writing that invents new worlds. King invents a new world here; he uses appropriate language for it. His narrative style is a mixture of bareness and inventiveness. It is never poetic or enchanting or even elegant. I miss that sometimes.<br />King is more a macro-master, i.e. he excels at plotting, while he neglects to some extent the micro-level of story-telling. You can rarely love his details.<br />The story puts up some resistance to your understanding. Maybe that's why some find it slow. You need to fight against some obstacles if you want to get inside this world. If you make it past the hurdles, you are somewhere else. I find no fault with that.<br />I know of SK's broad scope of subjects through the diversity of movies made after him. Making a movie of Lisey will be a challenge, but not an impossible one. It will be hard to stay away from overindulging in cheap tricks.<br />I may try some more of his books.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Every time I see this film I am left in silence, unable to speak.  It is the most powerful film I have ever seen.  The focus of this movie is primarily on the 24 hour period of Jesus' life where he is arrested, tried, sentenced to death and crucified.  Flashbacks to events in the gospels and imagined events in his life provide power allusions that help someone who is unfamiliar with Christianity to capture a little more of who Jesus was.<br /><br />I cannot mark this movie down for the blood and gore because that is the direct subject of this event.  Of all the passion scenes or movies I have seen, this one captures more of what I read in the Bible than any other movie. (I have a bachelors degree in Bible).<br /><br />Let me recommend this film for almost everyone. For those who are having trouble loving difficult people, this movie will change you.  For those who are having trouble forgiving others, this movie will enable you.  Not because of the movie itself, but the content of the script-much of it comes from the Bible and is itself exceptionally powerful.<br /><br />As far as the technical side of the movie.  The music generally enhances every step of the 'Via Dolorosa', and the slow-motion cut ins are not over done in my view.  They enable you to meditate on what is happening.  It's like our souls have been marinated in the power of what Jesus did.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar...the movie takes place on the Passover Feast of the Jews.  This feast celebrates the Exodus of Israel out of Egypt.  Another famous movie, The Ten Commandments, has the scene where the Jews put blood on the doorposts of their homes and the death angel passes over them.  On that night the firstborn of Egypt died, and Pharoah finally let Israel go.  It was memorialized as the Passover Feast.  The actual meal was a hastily prepared lamb (blemish free, year old male).<br /><br />Jesus himself is cast as the Passover Lamb, who takes away the sin of the world, but this is never explicitly stated in the movie.  One must know the meaning of the allusions to Passover and to the 'Death Sentence' of Jesus to understand.<br /><br />For Christians who grasp all of this, it is a deeply moving visual impression that causes many of us to consecrate ourselves freshly to God.  That's always been the effect on my spirit as I have seen this incredible movie.<br /><br />I would not recommend it for children under about the age of 8 or 9 because they cannot understand the real meaning of all these things and it is exceptionally graphic at times.<br /><br />If you have avoided this movie because of the graphic nature of it, I think you ought to sit down and watch it, especially during the Easter season.

B000N3ST7K|5.0|When I discovered that the soundtrack for Grindhouse was split in two, I was honestly very pleased. This meant a complete set of songs for both films (and each is certainly long enough to qualify as a feature film) and therefore another complete Tarantino score to add to my collection. <br /> <br />Tarantino has made a misstep or two in his career like most filmmakers, but his soundtracks have never, ever missed the mark. Death Proof is no exception. Regardless of how you feel about this one, the soundtrack is fantastic. As per usual, it is a collection of quasi-obscure 70's rock and R&B, interspersed with film dialogue you're likely to smile to, and some vintage Ennio Morricone. <br /> <br />In my opinion, this is in close competition with the Pulp Fiction soundtrack (which I feel is a benchmark for good scoring), and makes for excellent listening in the car, as it flows quite well, genre-jumping around a little less than the former. <br /> <br />The verdict... Buy it!
0743243153|5.0|How amazing that we are still writing reviews on this record-breaking book 30 years after its writing!  As another reviewer said, \\"The Road Less Traveled had an epiphany effect on my life.\\" That has surely been the case for thousands of readers. Peck's insights into spirituality (not to be confused with religion) had a far more profound, immediate and direct effect on my adult spirituality than did my strict religious upbringing and my entire education at private religious schools (without disparaging the lessons of my childhood rearing).    The section of this book titled \\"Discipline\\" taught me that \\"spiritual\\" means more than just religious--and I have been infinitely more in tune with my spiritual side (the non-physical aspects of who I am) in the 20 years since the first of my many readings of this book than I ever was before.    The advice on love is indispensable. I used to tell everyone I dated that our relationship could not proceed until after they'd read that section--so they'd know what love is and is not! Another favorite section is where Peck talks about how most people stop drawing their maps of the world (their view of reality) at an early age because it is extremely painful to make revisions. But wise people embrace the pain of constantly redrawing our maps because it results in great rewards of meaning and purpose.    Some have mocked Peck's first sentence, \\"Life is difficult,\\" as a great big \\"duh.\\" They fail to mention the point he makes... how he builds on that. According to testimony, entire lives have been changed by the end of page one. Life's most important truths are the simplest ones (I learned that from this book, and it is so true!), and once we understand that life is difficult by definition, instead of assuming it is expected to be relatively easy, then suddenly it no longer seems the world is against us personally, and life is no longer so difficult. One page, changed lives!    I have given 20 to 40 copies of this book as gifts over time. But I always recommended only the sections on Discipline and Love. I told them I really didn't get much from the section on Grace, and that they should take it or leave it as they wished. (I can't deduct a star for this, since the rest of the book is so good.) I also agree with those who have said parts of the book are a difficult read. My first copy was a gift to me, and I didn't read it for several years, not until too many people recommended it for me to ignore it any longer. I had gotten bogged down in the case histories--the psychiatry talk. But be patient. The good parts are always just around the corner.     A book this successful, this enduring, and with so many accolades and favorable testimonies cannot be ignored by wise, thoughtful people.

Alexander Perchov, portayed by Eugene Hutz, who is hilarious with his interpretive American -Ukrainian dialogue. When something is good, he calls it premium and this movie was that. Light hearted, not heavy, a good fit to offset all the [...]-ola on tv these days. Get it. You will love it. It's zany, yet believable

0792843584|2.0|What in \\"heavens name\\" were they thinking? Probably the most gorgeous western ever filmed and they chose to release it in non-anamorphic format? <br />This is unthinkable! Never mind that this epic flopped because of a viewing public with the attention span of a gnat, this film deserved to be released in the best format possible. This edition is the best so far but sorely lacking English subtitles. After repeatedly backing up the scenes in busy downtown Casper I am still to decipher much of the dialogue. The audio mixing could have been better here. What has happened to the directors hand in this release? Was he banned access to this film for all time? This is not the only film for which I have been awaiting a deserving release. The studios often have themselves to blame for their losses when butchering a directors vision simply because they think that the public doesn't have the potential to appreciate. \\"Reds\\" was another epic film that failed at box office, yet here it is 25 years later with it's long overdue proper release on DVD. I hope it won't take that long to see the proper release of this film.

I saw the non cartoon movie back in 1990 or 1991 so why do i need to watch a kiddie CGI cartoon with whiny kids in the theatre who are always talking or screaming or kids who are always flashing their cell phone lights every 2 minutes like it's some kind of rave in the movie theatre. For you kids who has to flash your cell phone lights ever minute or so, it's very annoying to the people who are sitting behind you in a stadium seating.

B000026156|4.0|seeing the names anthony braxton and sam rivers, this recording turned out to be not what i expected, breakneck playing, some screeching, screaming sax, with some atonality and those abstract sketches by anthony braxton. the track, interception, comes close to what i had in mind, breakneck playing and some screeching. otherwise, there are the differences, pleasurable and surprising, four winds and see-saw both appear blues inspired sax pieces. listening to the flutes on q&a, that track sounds a lot like a conference of birds, whereas the track, conference of the birds, with the stately bass sounds like a piece commissioned by a european royality in the early 18th century. now here (nowhere) sounds like it could had been written by anthony braxton. <br /> <br />not what i expected, but very enjoyable.
B00003CXDV|4.0|The humor in this movie works on two levels.  First is the comedy that results from the movie's basic premise: a bunch of TV actors suddenly find themselves in exactly the same sorts of adventures they used to act out on screen, only now it's real.  But second, and even funnier in my opinion, is the humor derived from parodying the entire world of science fiction, and its all to often rabid, religiously devoted fans.<br /><br />It also showcases the darker side of being involved with a pop-culture phenomenon: actors who become so closely identified with their roles, they find they simply can't get work doing anything else.  I imagine the real cast of \\"Star Trek\\" could feel how close to the mark this hits (and George Reeves, TV's Superman of the 1950s, may have even killed himself in despair at suffering this fate).  The most memorable scene in the movie for me was Alan Rickman's delivery of the line \\"By Grabthar's Hammer, I've never seen such savings.\\"  His rigid posture, hesitant speech, and stony facial expression are hilarious.  He's a classicly trained actor who's become pigeonholed in a role he considers beneath him, and he has been reduced to the humiliation of uttering childish drivel at store openings.  For all that much of the movie is made in the spirit of William Shatner's famous SNL \\"get a life\\" skit, the movie takes an affectionate look at fans, and two sci-fi geeks even provide indispensible help to the heroes in the end.

B000O178BY|5.0|Breaking the tradition of a five-year gap between albums, Trent Reznor has released the new Nine Inch Nails album \\"Year Zero\\" (2007) a mere two years after \\"With Teeth\\" (2005). Reznor attributes the long periods between albums in the past on alcohol and drug excess that comes from touring. Sober now for the last several years, focused and confident, Reznor's \\"Year Zero\\" is perhaps the best album of his career.<br /><br />\\"Highly conceptual. Quite noisy. F@!#ing cool\\" is how Reznor describes \\"Year Zero,\\" which I think, really hits the (pardon the pun) nail on the head.  Stepping outside himself and eschewing NIN's usual self-involved angry and depressive themes, \\"Year Zero\\" portrays a bleak picture of (presumably) American society sometime in the not too distant future. Conflict abounds, militarily and between classes, which is the major theme of the album. Different songs offer different perspectives of this futuristic world--from soldiers (\\"the good solider,\\") to greedy industrialists (\\"capital G\\") to extra-terrestrials; the listener sees this corrupt society from different vantage points.<br /><br />While Reznor took a more rock oriented, organic, almost live sounding approach with \\"With Teeth,\\" \\"Year Zero\\" sounds more like old-school NIN in that it is more \\"industrial\\" sounding, with less live drumming. And whereas when listening to most past NIN albums, one gets a sense of what the singles will be, with \\"Year Zero,\\" this is not so obvious. While some of the songs have an infectious hook, it's hard to imagine most of these songs as radio-staples, as the album is kind of \\"out there.\\" And while with many albums one can listen to individual tracks and enjoy the songs, separate from the album they are part of, \\"Year Zero\\" definitely sounds best when listened to in its entirety--as the listener can appreciate the songs more fully when the album is heard as a unit.  Like any NIN of course, there are a lot of textures, often with a lot of instrumentals and effects going on at once; so while this album sounds good with just one listen, it just gets better and better with repeated plays. And while \\"Year Zero\\" is \\"quite noisy,\\" the album doesn't hit you over the head the way \\"The Downward Spiral\\" does. \\"Year Zero,\\" while at times chaotic, is more restrained, but no less powerful.<br /><br />The short chaotic instrumental \\"Hyperpower,\\" in its urgency, sets the pace of the album. \\"The Beginning of the End,\\" with lyrics like \\"watch what you say they can read your mind,\\" paints the future in Orwellian terms. Tuneful and straightforward, \\"The Beginning of the End\\" is somewhat similar to the styling of \\"With Teeth\\" era NIN. The rocking \\"Survivalism,\\" already a radio hit, while not terribly challenging or one of the album's strongest songs, is effective and good enough. The somewhat subdued \\"The Good Solider,\\" is taken from the perspective of a soldier, who is seriously questioning why he is fighting. The chimes towards the end of the song are especially effective.  The bizarre, totally off-beat \\"Vessel,\\" sounds \\"big\\" but also spacey. When I listen to it I visualize a Tyrannosaurus Rex romping through some prehistoric jungle. I interpret the song to be about some kind of drug/mind control devise. The meaning behind the eerie, sluggish \\"Me, I'm Not\\" is ambiguous. A cool song, this one needs to grow on you. The industrial anthem \\"capital G\\" is perhaps one of the strongest songs on the album. From the perspective of \\"the machine,\\" the shakers and the movers behind business interests and the military-industrial-complex, \\"capital G\\" depicts the ruthlessness of those who hold the real power. \\"My Violent Heart,\\" which goes back-and-forth between a restrained verse and loud, frenzied chorus, is quite captivating. The meaning of the song is somewhat vague--with the clear message that actions have consequences, as Reznor proclaims:<br /><br />\\"you have set something in motion<br /><br />much greater than you've ever known<br /><br />standing there inall your grand naivety<br /><br />about to reap what you have sown\\"<br /><br />Another very off-beat but cool song, \\"The Warning,\\" describes the world from the perspective of some kind of alien life-form, perhaps \\"the presence,\\" the four fingered being that appears on the cover of the album. The religiously themed \\"God Given\\" has a real danceable beat to it, and could probably get a few spins in the clubs. \\"Meet Your Master,\\" both thematically and musically, sounds like a cross between \\"Head Like a Hole\\" and \\"Burn,\\" but is more three-dimensional and intricate. The instrumental \\"The Greater Good,\\" a medley of several different instruments is very low-key, creepy, and effective. The melodic and dark \\"The Great Destroyer\\" moves the album along nicely. One of Reznor's finest instrumental compositions, \\"Another Version of the Truth\\" is hauntingly beautiful and melancholy in its' understated elegance. The low-key \\"In this Twilight,\\" describing one's emotions on the eve of Armageddon, is stunning.  The submissive finale \\"Year Zero,\\" is the perfect closer, leaving a lasting impression that sums up many of the albums themes:<br /><br />\\"shame on us<br /><br />doomed from the start<br /><br />may god have mercy<br /><br />on our dirty little hearts<br /><br />shame on us<br /><br />for all we've done<br /><br />and all we ever were<br /><br />just zeros and ones\\"<br /><br />While I loved \\"With Teeth,\\" there is no doubt in my mind that this is a superior album. Even though I'm a huge NIN fan and tried my best to be objective while reviewing this album, there really isn't a negative thing I can say about it. \\"Year Zero\\" is a total triumph, musically and thematically. With the state of the world the way it is, living in George W. Bush's America, an album like \\"Year Zero\\" needed to be made. Not offering any simplistic solutions and without preaching, Reznor has made the definitive album of this decade--an album encompassing the feelings of anxiety and despair one feels living in the `00s, while taking NIN's music to new heights. Reznor's \\"Year Zero\\" is an undisputed masterpiece that is essential listening.in all your grand naivety <br />about to reap what you have sown\\" <br /> <br />Another very off-beat but cool song, \\"The Warning,\\" describes the world from the perspective of some kind of alien life-form, perhaps \\"the presence,\\" the four fingered being that appears on the cover of the album.

B000N4SHPS|4.0|To each his/her own. For me I enjoyed this movie and felt that Stallone has finanlly made up for it; for making part five which was least enjoyable one of the Rocky series in my opinion. Yeah some say that the idea of him coming out of retirement at 60 years old is silly but then again before he did this movie, wasn't there an actually boxing match that had two boxers coming out of retirement? any way I liked and that my opinion. Those that did not like it, that's ok too for that is your opinion.
B000FP2Z0S|4.0|This is quite simply a refreshing album. For me anyways it is. I had heard of Rise Against before but never really gave them a chance or second notice. But my friend played a long drive a few weeks ago and what I heard made me want to hear more, much more. I'm glad I decided to do so as this is all that I've been listening to since. Upon listening to the album its readily apparent that Rise Against has loads of talent. Another thing this album does right is grab you by your upper ear loab and not let go untill its ripped off and bleeding. Like previous albums, \\"The Sufferer & the Witness\\" is relentless from start to finish, but its utterly addictive during the whole thing. There really isn't a weak track on the whole album, but certain tracks are certainly stronger than others.<br /><br />I personally have found this album to be a breath of fresh air, and this really is not even my style of music. It has a unique feel to it, a big part of that being the vocals, which I find to be quite good. The only complaint I could have against this album is that it does tend to sound all the same. But on the other hand, if you like what that sounds like, its all good. You just don't have any slower songs to really break up the pace of the album.<br /><br />Great album, give it a chance, I dare you not to get addicted to it. The only question I have is will it stand the test of time and be a \\"classic\\" album years from now. Only time and perhaps only you can tell. Will you?
B000MXPE7O|3.0|Even though this movie got mixed reviews, I still went to watch it and enjoyed it. Now that it is out on DVD I can add it to my collection, and I only buy DVD's of movies that I enjoy.  <br />
B0006Z2LH4|5.0|I liked this sequal to the Cube movies. It does have it's scary parts of the movie as well as it's tense ones as well. The Cube series is a much different thriller than most of the movies in this genre. That is why I do like it so much because it is \\"different\\". In this sequal, it does give a \\"2 level lab rat\\" story and does also give a reason for their being \\"trapped\\". I highly recommend this movie to all of the Cube fans out there. You won't be disappointed.
B000NA28IE|3.0|I thought this movie was great on story line, Visual Effects, the action, heck the whole movie itself until I read the book and then I realized how much this movie sucks.  For one there is like 50 thing's in the book that weren't included in the movie.  The people who did this movie completely did a horrible job, I don't really know if I want to see eldest when it comes out.  Peter Jackson did a great job with Lord of the Ring's when it came out and maybe missed a few points out of the books, but when the producer made this movie I seriously think he was crossing his eyes when he read the book before he started making this movie.  If you haven't read the book then this is an awesome movie to see or even own, but if you read the book you'll realize how horrible this movie is.  I just wish I read the book before I made the mistake on spending $22.00 on this crappy movie.  I however do recommend this to the people who haven't read the novel, but if you have I would seriously pass on seeing this or even buying it.
B000001E3V|3.0|The heart and fire that made Derek and the Dominos is sorely missing. Without Duane Allman, this is simply another Clapton led sound alike diversion. Duane made \\"Layla\\" and the album one of rock's masterpieces. He carried Clapton to a new level that he had not seen before. This album's performance is an honest effort to keep the band going after Duane's sudden passing after the release of Layla, and is enjoyable listening, but anyone has who heard the Dominoes with a \\"Derek\\" (Duane Allman) will be well aware of the missing brilliance of the great SkyDog. I highly recommend that you consider the expanded version of Layla with Duane and all the jams with the Allman Brothers Band.
0452282152|5.0|I am not a big art fan, but this book made me fall in love with Vermeer's work! I know, its fiction, but I love looking at the paintings and imagining the version of Vermeer portrayed in this book.  The story is beautifully written.  Chevalier's description on the art is flawless. However, do not skip this book even if you aren't an art fanatic. The story itself is breathtaking! Who knows, you may even discover that you love Vermeer's work as well!
0060530839|5.0|I read this book as a teenager, learning of Lewis from my passion for Tolkien. The book totally fascinated me then, and made me hungry for more. I remember reading a few more of the books in the series, and though I enjoyed them, I never did find the original magic in them that this one inspired. I lost one of the books or two and never completed the series, but years later I returned to it in order to read them to my step-son, and now I'm very glad to have read the whole series in it's entirity.<br />  First off, this and the first book are absolutely the best ones.  This time we started with the first book, which I think is named \\"The Magician's Nephew,\\" and I daresay that as an adult I enjoyed it even MORE than \\"Wardrobe.\\" The origins of the breach into Narnia and the original sin that freed the witch were fascinating to me.<br />  But returning to \\"Wardrobe\\" was a true delight. Now that I can better digest the symbolism and glean more from the story with the added info learned from \\"Nephew,\\" the book claimed a new tantalizing power over me. My step-son enjoyed it immensely, and couldn't wait to have another chapter read to him each night for bedtime.<br />  As an adult I am now able to better appreciate Lewis's incredible talent for character developement and symbolism, as well as his strong imagination and elegant writing style. The rest of the books were also great, and I'm happy to have finally gotten around to reading them all. Certainly the least in the \\"Narnia\\" series is far and above the vast majority of children's chapter books. But for me, the first two are by far the best, approaching the status of even 'The Hobbit,\\" and from me that is saying worlds.<br />  J. Lyon Layden<br />The Other Side of Yore
B000MXPE7O|3.0|Everything from the plot, dialogue, directing, and acting is just average. Matt Damon's character is beyond boring, Angelina Jolie wasn't needed, and the other top actors just have bit roles that don't amount to much. Like another review here mentioned, the deaf girl was by far the best and most interesting character. When your watching a movie about the birth of the CIA, you expect a little action, especially in a three hour film.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|In 1997, I saw Titanic in the movie theatre at least 10 times (and cried each time!), and I wore my VHS to shreds. Although I had purchased the regular DVD, I was totally thrilled to get this collectors editions. It is a MUST for the serious Titanic enthusiast and amateur historian.<br /><br />The deleted scenes are fantastic, especially the scene where Rose tries to undress herself and can't manage it and she gets so angry...the emotional buildup in that scene helps to explain how she came to nearly killing herself but instead meeting up with Jack. I wish they hadn't cut that scene from the movie...very powerful! I appreciated having the other documentaries regarding the Titanic story, and of course Celine Dion sounded wonderful singing \\"My Heart Will Go On.\\"<br /><br />Yes, this version is a winner overall.
B00005JPCF|2.0|... But most likely in boredom, unless you're really young. If you're older, skip this and watch March Of The Penguins instead. This is pretty much a happier version.<br /><br />As I quite often mention in reviews of animations, these days it's more spot the famous voice, than actually paying that much attention to the film. Here, we have Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, a poor effort by Robin Williams, and Brittany Murphy. But in this, it's also a case of spot the song used. Yes, there are some full songs used, but there's also a couple where just a line or two is used. How many did you spot? I managed to spot all of these:<br /><br />Somebody To Love (bad vocal from Brittany)<br />My Way<br />Kiss (Nicole Kidman doing her Marilyn Monroe impersonation)<br />Boogie Wonderland<br />I Only Have Eyes For You<br />Unchained Melody<br />Hello<br />Let's Talk About Sex<br />Heartbreak Hotel (when's Hugh Jackman releasing an album?)<br />Chantilly Lace<br />I'll Make Love To You<br />Shake Your Bon-Bon<br />If You Leave Me Now<br />Baby Got Back<br />Leader Of The Pack<br /><br />Quite a handful yes?<br /><br />The also problem I have is that many animations these days, with talking animals, are all \\"animals vs humans\\", which is getting a little bit tired. But at least there's no drug references in this, like some older Disney movies. It's also too long for a kids film, and I was getting antsy watching it, so I guess any kid will be totally bored and annoying their parents by some point.<br /><br />The film also throws across a very strong political message, about global warming, humans wrecking the environment and animals suffering. Is that really what you want in a kids movie? I know very old Disney shorts were very pro-war but in this day and age, it's not really appropriate. I recently bought the two Ice Age movies, I wonder what message I'm going to get that I'm old enough to understand.<br /><br />It may be a cute movie, but if you've already seen March Of The Penguins, you will notice a few similarities. And the whole scene where the penguin is being batted about by a whale's tail - hello, if that was real, the penguin would have all its bones broken, and would be dead. It's a whale's TAIL. Ouch!<br /><br />I was expecting this to be a nice happy Easter movie, as it was released in time for it, but was disappointed once again, by an animation film. When are they going to release all their fancy motion capture and CGI aren't going to save a movie?ale's tail - hello, if that was real, the penguin would have all its bones broken, and would be dead.

0743496728|5.0|Jodi Picoult's latest novel, Nineteen Minutes, begins on a normal morning in a normal town on what would appear to be a normal day. Alex Cormier leaves her daughter Josie to finish getting ready for school as she rushes off to the courthouse where Alex serves as a judge. Families begin their days and children settle into another day of school tedium. That is until gunshots tear through Sterling High School. Chaos ensues, fear is palpable in the air, and when all is said and done, 10 students are dead and the town of Sterling, New Hampshire, must pick up the pieces of their shattered lives.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult is one of my absolute favorite authors. The way she constructs images and detail is amazing. Nineteen Minutes was fantastic. Picoult's best work since My Sister's Keeper. The plot was gripping. I had trouble putting this book down. In a post-Columbine world, I think the reader is searching for an answer as to why something like this would happen, even if it is a work of fiction that provides it. I cannot praise this novel enough. I highly recommend this novel and all of Picoult's works.
B0002234LS|2.0|I was really disappointed in this movie, as Johnny Depp seems to sleepwalk through the entire role, and shows none of his previous greatness from other roles. And the two tone hair? Not a good look.<br /><br />My dad has all of Stephen King book's but the last couple he has read, he has either struggled to get into, or found it was too similar to previous novels. I've read a couple, but watching this, I discovered every Stephen King stereotype/cliche is included. The loner eccentric writer, by himself in the middle of nowhere, the strange man - just everything about this film.<br /><br />There's also a very unexpected twist, which not only ruins what was already a mess before the twist hits, but comes so abruptly, that you have to actually pause the film and work out what on earth is going on. The 'twist' has become the most overused solutions in Hollywood in thrillers etc of the past few years, and they're getting worse, and more predictable each time. For me, the twist completely ruined this film. Other reviewers disagree.<br /><br />Maria Bello, the fabulous bar owner from Coyote Ugly, is seriously underused, and underdeveloped as a character, that it's a waste of time in even having her in the movie.<br /><br />Major disappointment. See some of Johnny's earlier films for his best work. And if you want to see something really off the wall, watch Benny & Joon.<br /><br />And on that note: \\"Rah! Rah! Rah!\\"<br /><br />Quite.<br /><br />And there was absolutely nothing 'thrilling' about it.
B000M4RG4C|3.0|Flags of Our Fathers (2006): For a movie about the flag, Clint Eastwood does not wave it enough. After his death, the son of one of the six flag raisers on Iwo Jima, wrote a terrific book (read it) on which this movie is based. Three of the flag raisers later died in the fight on Iwo Jima and the remaining three were brought home for a bond tour. Before the movie, I knew the strategic reasons for taking Iwo Jima, the failure of the pre-landing bombardment, and the impossible task asked of the Marines. Still, the manner in which the movie skips back and forth between the interviews of the son in preparing for his book, the actual battle on the island, and the bond tour, left me confused.  Eastwood apparently wanted to make a movie about the futility of war, an up-to-date Paths of Glory, but to the American people, Iwo Jima will always be remembered as the highest example of valor. The movie should have alternated between the Marines on Iwo Jima and the three flag raisers at home on the bond tour. Their confusion and guilt over being called heroes while their friends were still dying would have given the movie a context that made it understandable to the viewer. The flag raising occurred four days after the landing, but the hard brutal fighting, basically Marines with rifles against entrenched positions, went on for three more weeks. We suffered 26,000 Marine casualties on Iwo Jima, one third of all Marine casualties in the Pacific war. 6,800 died, more than double the deaths in the Twin Towers and 27 men (22 Marines and 5 Navy corpsmen), won the Medal of Honor, of which one half were posthumous. Eastwood thinks the loss of 20,000 Japanese is due to some equivalent concern, apparently shared by some of the reviewers who look forward to seeing Letters From Iwo Jima.
B000GIWRIY|5.0|Well, I suppose that quite a few hard-core Tull fans may have heard this, but by 1995, they weren't such a huge commercial force to be a reckoned with. Not since 1980's A had Tull released such a uniformly strong album, and one that would have fit in snugly with their 70's masterpieces.<br /><br />Everything is here: Ian Anderson's lyrics are at their very best, as are his compositional and flute-playing skills. Martin Barre sounds positively rejuvenated, as his playing is even more supple than usual. The rhythm section is good, with Doane Perry's creative and dynamic drumming, and Dave Pegg and Steve Bailey both providing credible bass.<br /><br />There isn't a weak song here. Roots to Branches is a majestic piece, and one with beautiful lyrics. Rare and Precious Chain, This Free Will and Out Of The Noise are all vintage Tull, with Tull's mixture of progressive rock and world music. A word here about Tull's progressive tendencies. Personally, I think that the reason why Tull has aged so much more gracefully than their 70's progressive-rock cohorts is that Anderson always ensured that there was an organic, folk base to their music. This basis gave Tull's music a timeless quality that eludes most of their contemporaries.<br /><br />At Last Forever is a gorgeous song that evokes Autumn; a lot of Jethro Tull's music does this for me. Dangerous Veils is one of the all-time great Tull songs, and Valley is a work of genius.<br /><br />It's simply a travesty that this came and went commercially in the States. Not only is it one of Jethro Tull's greatest albums, it's one of the greatest albums of the Nineties.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|I found Children of Men to be slow-moving, predictable, overtly political, and unoriginal to the point that I turned it off.<br /><br />And you can see by the way the army of leftist fanatics are spamming the negative reviews that this is a very political movie. You are warned.<br /><br />I don't care for Bush, but I dislike propaganda more.
B000M5AJQS|2.0|The parallel story of a police informant within a Boston gang and a gang informant within the police.  Well filmed and generally acted well, this film is nonetheless over-rated.  The plot is excessively complex with realism sacrificed in the interest of making the stories of the 2 informants parallel.  This allows a lot of well done cross-cutting between plot lines but strains credulity.  Some of the dialogue verges on self-parody.  Most of the principals and supporting cast do well but Jack Nicholson's performance as an evil Nietzschean egoist is rank scenery chewing.  The French Connection this isn't.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|I can't believe the depth of this album.  Rich, complex....not your average metal.  Brutal and beautiful..like football.
B0000009RX|5.0|In college, our \\"hippie\\" friend Lowell W... introduced our group to Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention.  Soon, I was adding Mothers LPs (They came on vinyl, you know) to my ecclectic record collection.  So, what was this stuff anyhow?  Political comment? Rock N Roll?  It certainly was not Country & Western!  What a puzzle!  (However, it might have been political satire because Zappa seems to have written a song about my family friendly congressman before he was even elected.  \\"Just have your fun, you old son of a gun, and drive off in your Lincoln...\\"  So, Lowell up and writes Frank about what's it really mean anyhow and signs it Lo W...  Now, Zappa was not one to waste a stamp on a fan.  But, a few months later a full page ad appeared for the newest Mother's album in \\"The Rolling Stone.\\"  The headline read:  \\"Dear Lo:  We're only in it for the money!\\" and there was a large photo of the album cover and some other stuff.  Well, we still did not know what it was all about, but I enjoyed the album.  I cannot speak for the entire listings of the Mothers on Amazon, but \\"We're only in it for the money\\" is my favorite Zappa CD.  I still do not know what the goofy thing is all about, but I think the title is telling the truth.
B000000OAA|5.0|I first heard this on a used LP years ago but I'll spare you the history lesson. This is a fantastic collection of tunes where heavy metal and cabaret collide with Beatle-type song structures and - somehow - it all holds together perfectly. The musicianship is amazing and, perhaps because none of the songs here were played to death on the radio, virtually all of this CD sounds as fresh as it did years ago. Even if you're sick of the few Queen songs that are still in heavy radio rotation, you will find much to cheer about here. The production is sleek, the riffs are furious, and the harmonies are stellar. <br /> <br />Highlights? \\"Brighton Rock\\" is an incredible guitar workout (including multiple overdubbed guitar harmonies) but has enough signature and tempo changes to have done most prog bands proud. \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" is speed metal years before anyone could imagine such a thing, with heavy fleet fingered riffs that owe nothing to blues rock. And then there's the pop perfection of \\"Killer Queen,\\" the alienated balladry of \\"Tenement Funster\\" and the operatic strangeness of \\"In the Lap of the Gods.\\" <br /> <br />
B000KX0IOK|5.0|I saw the short film this was based on, and I'm glad they decided to<br /><br />turn it into a full length film. Ryan is outstanding in the lead, and<br /><br />Shareka sure holds her own.<br /><br />Excellent film.
B000068OCS|5.0|No plot, no dialogue, only great music, great images, and a great message... <br />Quite an outstanding movie, to be watched in concentration, with your headphones on... <br /> <br />It leaves something in you and helps you put things into perspective. <br />It has been produced back in 1983, and I found myself wondering what those human beings caught by the camera were thinking at the time... what they were worrying about, what they were their ambitions and above all - what became of them. <br />Thinking of these things, things fell even more into perspective...
B00005V9HH|4.0|If you like complex, action filled films with a mystery element that keeps you guessing, this is definitely your film.  Perfect?  No--that title for me goes to the film where this film's title came from, \\"Casablanca.\\"
B000J4QWMC|1.0|The concept of a movie based on Miami Vice is such a good one, we had high expectations that just weren't met. We could not clearly hear most of the conversation in this movie and the plot was hard to follow because of this. Ultimately I fell asleep. The cast, cars, boats and scenery were all beauties and wasted on this production. (How did Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell get sucked into this lemon?)
B000062Y98|5.0|my friend pointed this band out to me a while ago, and i am glad he did, this is one of the most amazing bands i have heard in a long time. great musicianship shines throughout this album. and in my opinion this is their best album. nightfall on middle earth was also a great album but i think this one is just a little bit better. every song on this album shines and is like a symphony of awesomeness flowing through my ears. the best songs on the album are definatly battle field and the epic monster that is one minute of silence.  <br /> <br />trust me on this folks. if you are a fan of any type of metal you need to get not just cd but all the cds this band has put out. these guys are the reigning champs of power metal.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|This was a pretty good film. Farrel and Foxx were good enought for me. I could have done without the affair between Li Gong and Sonny (it took too much time).  This movie feels kind of like the movie Heat but not the same caliber of movie.  MV can be fairly intense. The gun battles were good.  This movie is at least a rental and $5 for a used copy is probably worth it for several viewings. I am hoping for sequels.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This could have easily been the movie of the year.  Will Smith plays Chris Gardner, a down on his luck Medical Equipment Salesman who decides to push back when his life gets rough.  He pursues through very tough times, and manages to keep his son happy, and finally is able to find real happiness with the success of his word, his morals, and excellent work ethic.  An inspirational story for all.  The characters in this film are all believable, and it is great to think that this is based on a true story.  Weather you have read the book or not, this film is worth renting or buying.  You won't be dissapointed.
B00005JPCF|2.0|I'll start with the positive: The animation is great and a visual treat.  Now the bad news: This movie is an excuse to expose kids to sexual themes (inappropriate songs & situations) and the \\"humans are the problem\\" philosophy.  Besides that it's just not a very good movie.  We've seen this kind of preachy stuff before.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|The film opens, the youngest person on the planet was just killed.  He was 18.  The second youngest person is a woman only a few weeks older...and there have been no children since.  <br /> <br />Britain seems to be the one place that everyone wants to go and the UK Immigrations people have an illegal alien problem that'd put the TX border to shame.   <br />\\"Fishes\\" are a group of radicals who want every British immigrant to have equal rights.  <br /> <br />The one pawn in this game is a young Fiji woman who is pregnant.  Radicals are trying to sneak her out of the country onto a mythical ship called \\"Tomorrow\\" where human reproduction is being studied.  <br /> <br />The story's fast-paced and fascinating.  You really didn't dare get up to get a drink or lose attention or you'd miss an important detail. The acting was particularly good-Michael Caine as an aging hippie type was wonderful.   <br /> <br />I definitely need to read PD James' book so I can understand some of the concepts better.  In many ways, I wish I had seen this film in the theatre--yes, it's worth full price.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|I was really mad last winter, when the Pursuit of Happyness was released in theaters and my busy schedule kept me from taking a trip to the cinema to see it. Well one day in browsing Blockbuster I realized it had come out on DVD, so I take it home with me. <br /> <br />It was a 2-day rental. I still haven't given it back. <br /> <br />Inspired by a true story, Will Smith stars as Chris Gardner, the poor salesman who has a problem with parking tickets and paying rent. He's a very smart guy, though, as he is able to complete a Rubik's Cube in only a few minutes...talk about skilled! He has a son, Christopher, who he had with his girlfriend who leaves him towards the beginning of the movie. Chris applies for an internship as a stock broker in hope that he will be able to produce the money to provide a better living atmosphere for he and his son. <br /> <br />Will Smith has never given a finer performance. As a Hollywood multi-million dollar actor, the way he is able to portray a poor man in such a realistic way is beyond me. Little Jaden Smith (Will's son) does a surprisingly amazing job as Chris's son.   <br /> <br />But, in my opinion, the best part about this movie is the message: \\"If you want something, go get it. Period.\\" I couldn't agree with this statement more, and the true story of Chris Gardner proves it. Also, as American citizens, the Declaration of Independence says that we are entitled to the priveleges of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The PURSUIT of happiness...it's like happiness is something we can never gain...only pursue. :) <br /> <br />Highly recommended. Two hours well-spent in front of my TV.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|Arcade Fire proves to be one of the indie-rock bands that will truly \\"conquer\\" the music scene in due time.  Their debut FUNERAL sold surprisingly well to be an indie-rock album and even garnered a Grammy nomination for best alternative album (it lost to The White Stripes's GET BEHIND ME SATAN). NEON BIBLE seeks to heighten the profile of Arcade Fire to even loftier heights.  It definitely accomplishes this goal;  the buzz for NEON BIBLE has been lingering for months and rightfully so. I was inspired to purchase NEON BIBLE after a couple of noteworthy events: a free promotional download of the great \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" from FUNERAL, numerous magazine support (Rolling Stone, Spin), and an MTV segment promoting the album, particularly the pipe-organ laced \\"Intervention\\".  The minute that I listened to it, I was instantly impressed by the great musicality of this group as a whole and how much they bring to the table. If you buy NEON BIBLE, you will definitely not be disappointed.<br /><br />\\"Black Mirror\\" opens up NEON BIBLE very strongly, and the recording quality seeks to reflect the sound of an indie-rock band; there's a certain old fashioned 60s/70s sound here- a sound that makes you infee that the studio was mic-ed in such a way that all the mics were distant from the instruments and the lead vocalist (NOTE: The studio was a church in Quebec, Canada). Regarding the track itself, the chord progression is great and the use of piano adds a certain timbre to the arrangement. The vocals are strong, and even when he ventures  bit out of tune, the idiosyncrasies are what craft this independent form of rock. \\"Keep The Car Running\\" proves to be just a strong, if not stronger, while \\"Neon Bible\\" has an inherent folk/country-rock feel to it. It isn't quite as memorable as \\"Black Mirror\\" or as rocking as \\"Keep The Car Running\\", but it is definitely solid. My personal favorite and the most touching track in my opinion is the pipe-organ laced \\"Intervention\\", perhaps one of the very top rock tracks in my opinion of 2007.  I'll be the first to admit I'm not a fan of bands like Nickelback, but biased  or unbiased, I think that a track such as \\"Intervention\\" is much more credible than \\"Photograph\\" or any of Nickelback's other singles.  \\"Intervention\\" is truly poetic and dynamic with the message that lead vocalist sings so convincingly.  It is the perfect track, and will definitely go down as one of Arcade Fire's best or definitive tracks.<br /><br />\\"Black Waves/ Bad Vibrations\\" definitely has a different feel than most of the preceding tracks to it.  Interesting about NEON BIBLE is that the album as a whole has this same vibe-  \\"Black Mirror\\" is quite different from \\"Neon Bible\\" and \\"Neon Bible\\" is quite different than say \\"Intervention\\".  \\"Black Waves/ Bad Vibrations\\" proves to be another worthwile track, with two basic contrastings sections-- one with a lady as the lead vocalist and the second with a male.  It doesn't allure as much as \\"Intervention\\" (though I'm incredibly in love with that particular track), but it is pretty great.  The background harmonies are definitely worthy of praise. \\"Ocean of Noise\\" instantly grabs the listeners attention with a plethora of sound effects including low piano rumblings, and ocean noises among other things.  I love the way the band embraces the lower, \\"muddier\\" register of the piano here; it truly gives off the effect of the ocean.  The songwriting as always is top notch, and the lead vocalist sounds as strong and as convincing as ever.<br /><br />\\"The Well And The Lighthouse\\" keeps the tempo moving along and once again the beauty of indie-rock is preserved via NEON BIBLE. The raw feel of the guitars and lovely string work are combined to create utter indie-beauty. I love the change of style towards the end of this track; it is absolutely brilliant.  The string runs are awesome and the lead vocalist has never sounded better.  The representation of a hymn via an indie-rock band has never beenarticulated so well nor so convincingly.  BEAUTIFUL! \\"(Antichrist Television Blues)\\" features some nice production touches with dirty-sounding guitars, boxy sounding drums, hand claps, organ, and nice touches of piano. The lead vocalist isn't really accurate where pitch is concerned here, but again, it is the idiosyncrasies that truly help and make the character of NEON BIBLE.<br /><br />\\"Windowstill\\" is one of the loveliest and sincerest tracks on NEON BIBLE. You feel a certain passion, emotion from the singer being emoted throughout the track.  The nice touches of strings add to the effect being captured here by Arcade Fire. \\"No Cars Go\\" is another of my personal favorites, and I'm sure other fans agree as well. It begins with live acoustic instrumentation (brass, strings) and then breaks into a great easy-going rock feel laced with interspersed strings and brass.  Last but not least is closure \\"My Body Is A Cage\\", which is different from all the other tracks from NEON BIBLE. Chilling pipe organ sounds support the lead vocalist along with an incredible \\"haunting\\" drum groove.  It is a very proper way to close this great album, particular when full instrumentation is added in.<br /><br />I have no qualms really about NEON BIBLE.  It is honestly very strong, innovative, and interesting to listen to.  From a production standpoint, I think it is interesting to listen to the different sounds used, the quality (obvious that it was recorded in a church), and such. I think it is an album that will stand the test of time. 4 stars.never been articulated so well nor so convincingly.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|This thrash classic is considered by many to be the greatest thrash metal album ever recorded, and they have excellent reason to think so. This is Megadeth at it's finest and the only album to even come close to this masterpiece is Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? Even that isn't quite as good as this though. The real spotlight on this album is the guitars which Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman just shred on. This is pretty much a guitar players' dream. Just listen to Hangar 18. That song alone has enough solos to occupy a whole record alone. They're just insane. I don't know how those guys get their fingers to move that fast. This is exactly what thrash metal is supposed to sound like. So Far So, So Good...So What! was released two years prior to Rust In Peace and on that many problems arose, mainly due to Mustaine's drug addiction. And seeing that he is the front man, those problems kind of trickled down throughout the band. So what they released was a very good, but not great album. Rust In Peace marked a milestone for Megadeth in the sense that it was the first time the band worked sober in the studio writing music. What did that make for? An extraordinary, better than ever before album. This was also a hit to fans and most critics alike, marking it their strongest album to date.<br /><br />The musical complexity on this album is unparalleled to almost all other albums. I don't know how Dave can sing and play guitar at the same time on these songs live. All the instruments are intrically played and extremely tight together. You would've thought Friedman and drummer, Nick Menza, were in this band for numerous years. There are three fan favorites on here, those being- Holy Wars, Hangar 18, and Tornado Of Souls. Tornado is my all time favorite Megadeth song. The whole thing is fast, agressive, non stop in-your-face metal, as is most of the album. There is real cool background singing about 1/3 of the way through chanting \\"who\\" when Dave belts out the rest. Holy Wars would be my second favorite song on here and maybe second favorite song ever by Megadeth. Of course it's a live encore staple. Hangar 18 is probably the most overall complex song on here, mainly because of the near ending, countless amount of solos. Five Magics is also a cool song with mythological lyrics. Take No Prisoners is lightening fast and the ending has an awesome metal chant. The only mediocre song whatsoever is Dawn Patrol, which is a tedious/noneventfull song with no guitars. Just drums, bass, and Dave talking the whole way through with a droning kind of voice. The bonus tracks are a cool extra, but I usually just stick to the studio tracks. My Creation is a real cool song though that would've have been a much better replacement for Dawn Patrol.<br /><br />If you don't have this album yet, you are missing out on a huge part of thrash metal and metal history for that matter. This is one of the finest metal albums ever recorded and it is a must have for everyone. If you haven't heard Megadeth much and want to get into them or here more stuff, what better place to start then Rust In Peace. Believe me when I say that this album WILL NOT dissapoint.e my second favorite song on here and maybe second favorite song ever by Megadeth. Of course it's a live encore staple.

B000MCH5P4|3.0|Much like the human condition, Babel is not a superficial or an easy tale to follow as the film examines the commonalities among people separated by language. The stories of four families intersect across 3 continents with each confronting life's adversities and the consequences of their individual decisions. Innocence, loves, lives and dreams are lost but the people persevere as a tenuous string of interconnected events weave through their lives.<br /><br />An American couple is at the center of the film trying to salvage their marriage after the loss of a child. Taking a trip to Morocco their life intersects with a family of a simple mountain shepherd trying to survive. Meanwhile the American's maid strives for the freedoms and future she can touch but not possess. A Japanese Widower and his teenage daughter try to come to grips with each other, the daughter's sexual maturity and the suicide of the mother. How does this all come together? Amazingly enough it does but only if you too can persevere!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I own the anniversary edition and I have seen the Platinum edition and I did not see that much of an improvement. They did add some sound effects, but it was not enough for me to buy another version of this movie. If you don't own the anniversay then buy the new one,but if you do own it, don't bother. The movie itself is excellent and one of Pacino's most famous and greatest roles. A excellent supporting cast and well written script round out one of the best gangster films of all time! The anniversary edition has an excellent transfer and some interesting extras.
B000002LGQ|4.0|The year 1989 was no doubt the pinnacle of Madonna's success. The release of \\"Like a Prayer\\" reinforced her status as a pop culture icon, gifted musician, trendsetter, fascinating persona, and the reigning Queen of Pop. This album challenged people's thinking and gave pop music more integrity than it ever had, which is why it is still hailed by critics in the present day as one of the best pop albums ever released. The title track, \\"Express Yourself,\\" and \\"Keep It Together\\" are the most obvious standouts; anthems that rallied for empowerment, faith, and humility. \\"Oh Father,\\" \\"Til' Death Do Us Part,\\" and \\"Promise to Try\\" offered glimpses of hidden vulnerabilities that were (and still are) often overshadowed by some of Madonna's outrageous antics, while \\"Spanish Eyes\\" and \\"Act of Contrition\\" are as shrewd as pop music gets. The album has its share of duds though as well. \\"Love Song\\" and \\"Dear Jessie\\" are both critical flukes; songs that weren't intended to be anything more than filler but garnered accolades nonetheless, and even though \\"Cherish\\" is one of the most inviting tracks on the album, it still sounds like a leftover from \\"True Blue.\\" Despite the album's lack of cohesiveness, its emotional, spiritual, and cultural impact remain unrivaled to this very day. It also marked one of the few times Madonna's craft matched her ambition. An undeniable classic.
B000ASSDVA|3.0|I love the story, it is great, length of film is no problem, my problem is that Amazon advertises that there is \\"closed caption\\" on it, non at all, we have deaf in family, a major disapointment to them, I believe this is a bare bones copy from Japan, so if you are in need of \\"C/C\\", don't buy this one, I wish I hadn't.
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|When will My Chemical Romance realise that they're just a bunch of light-weight pop musicians and that the rest of the not-pre-pubescent-teen-girl world wants them to shut up?  It's really annoying that they're clogging up the airwaves with their trash.  Not like there's much on the airwaves that isn't trash already.  If you watch MTV for all the so cuuuuuuuuute boys on it, then yeah, you'll love this radio-ready, corporate contraption designed as music.  The rest of us will shake our heads, go put on something much better, and shut out this terrible pop phenomenon.  I hope emo dies, and along with it My Chem. <br /> <br />Speaking on a different note, bravo to the Queen comparisons, because Queen are just as terrible as My Chem.  Why?  Because they too were a carefully produced, designed, and marketed product disguised as music.  If you want realy seventies music, go listen to Joy Division, Gang of Four, King Crimson, or Yes.  Way, way better.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|How's Jack going to play his next character? That's half the draw of this movie...Face it you just gotta love Nicholson as an Irish mobster. Add Scorcese, Wahlberg, DiCaprio and Matt Damon and you're in for one great ride! The character-play between Nicholson, DiCaprio and Damon is some of the best I've seen in years with a plot as twisted as Miller's crossing. Frankly you can't go wrong with this gangster flick and it shines as one of the best but it's no Goodfellas. It's mean and gritty New York done Scorcese style.<br /><br />You're going to read other reviews about the plot so I want to talk about the best bits between the characters. Frankly, I think DiCaprio deserves kudos for his portrayal of a deep cover investigator working to get the goods on and identify the moles Nicholson has placed at the highest levels of the state's special investigative units. If you're a fan of counter espionage plots you will enjoy the dance between DiCaprio and Damon as well as Sheen and Nicholson. The drama is riveting and suspenseful--rarely leaving you a chance to relax. Wahlberg does an admirable job adding that essential spice to the recipe of intensity and pressure upon the characters. All in all this is a great film---one that neither the Gangster nor Espionage aficionado should go without seeing!
B00006AUIG|5.0|April 7 2007 <br /> <br />I put the local news on when I woke 6 days after first visiting the new \\"condos\\" on the site where this film was shot. It was Danvers State Hospital burning again!!! I could'nt believe my eyes and ears. I was there only last week for the first time in my life and here it was looking like Ground Zero. Yikes...I've lived only a half an hour from the infamous Hathorne Hill over my 39 years. I was finally drawn to it's walls when I first saw this film in 2006. <br /> <br />The Kirkbride buildings are not completely destroyed yet. They are saving three buildings which have been gutted and are going to be restored. But what of the tunnels? And what of the cemetary \\"back there\\". And all those bad vibes on the hill? <br /> <br />This film requires multiple viewings to understand Gordy's character. He is a \\"weak\\" or \\"wounded\\" man because of his meta-physical exhaustion due to the his newborn who is sick and keeping him and his wife up all night. <br /> <br />During the final segment you'll \\"hear\\" David Caruso's character tell Gordy to recall all of the \\"boiling water\\" incident. And if you listen closely you'll hear him \\"silence\\" everyone in the vicinity. The use of sound in this film is what makes it so penetrating. <br /> <br />There is nothing more \\"scary\\" or rather traumatizing than psychological horror. Why...because it's real and can happen to anyone.
B000JIHP88|4.0|Check to see if the crib or play-yard you intend this for will actually work with it.  When mine didn't, I decided to attach it (secure and safe) to my headboard.  Curious about reports that it's not loud enough, I laid down and had a listen.  It's plenty loud enough, even at a distance of 2.5 feet overhead.  Remember, your infant hasn't spent time in front of the speakers at a Counting Crows concert!  When the baby (9 weeks old) finally got a shot at it, he was enchanted, stimulated, very excited.  So much for soothing -- but it's wonderful to know that while I'm having to fold laundry he's watching the bright colors and listening to lovely music.  A great addition to the day with baby...
B000KXXM34|5.0|I could not honestly say I knew the world until I read this book.  For Chomsky fans out there, particularly lay ones, this is a must.  Most books with his name are authored by him and are filled, every other line, with quotes he uses from other people.  Basically, they are in speech form, with half the speech being a reference.<br /><br />This one, however, is quite different.  It's a series of free form discussions where people ask him whatever comes to their minds.  His ability to span a world history of information to respond on his feet is dazzling.  He's very direct and uses very little quotes from others (naturally because he's giving a talk).  In other words, indispensable might be inaccurate, pure and unfiltered is more like it.  I have many of his books, but this is the only one I could read all the way through and I find myself constantly coming back to it.  CAN'T RECOMMEND ENOUGH!<br /><br />Btw, I don't know why this wouldn't be available new or used.  I just got it less than a year ago at my local Walden Books, which is incredibly small.  Look around for it a little while and you'll find it (I'm sure as hell not selling mine!).
B000N3ST8O|5.0|A Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks fan for over 30 years, I welcome any material that's new to me at this point.  I love the making of Belladonna portion of the dvd but be forewarned this was recorded on old vhs tape and it shows.  Even so, it's a pleasure to hear Ms Nicks in the recording studio and also to see her hamming it up.  The Blue Lamp photo shoot was gorgeous and there's also a clip of Stevie dancing with graceful abandon.  The package is well put together although I was disappointed in the booklet.  The photos in the Enchanted booklet are far superior.  I'm waiting for the day when an entire concert from perhaps the Wild Heart period is released, I know there are out there.  I still love Stevie Nicks but she was at her peak in her younger days and we fans want more, more, more!
B00004W50T|5.0|Music from Big Pink was one of the first albums I bought as a teenager in the late 60s. It came at a time in my life when I was discovering the world around me, becoming conscious of social issues and discovering who I was. <br /> <br />The music touched my soul and gave life meaning and wonder at a time so much  was uncertain. I still listen to the album on occasion and it remains astounding in it's simplicity, beauty and imagery. My favorite album of all time.
B000O75F7C|4.0|I've got the entire PT catalogue: PT to me are Pink Floyd for the 21st Century, and Steve Wilson one of the few truly creative rock musicians around there. <br /> <br />The disk being a concept album about the \\"amusing ourselves to death\\" culture, it is probably their darkest one ever.  <br /> <br />I had the album running in heavy rotation on my iPod for the past few days. I like all of it except for the last song. The long \\"Anesthetize\\" is  probably my favorite --- it also has a guest spot by Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson (Rush are fans of the band). <br /> <br />And yes, some bone-grinding heavy riffs, but that's only one ingredient of the PT sound. All the other ingredients are in evidence (ambient-ish keyboard textures, elaborate sound processing by studio virtuoso and band leader Steve Wilson, vocals going from mellow harmony parts to distorted solo singing, sometimes surprising harmony changes,...). Bass playing and drumming are especially tasty in the less heavy parts. <br /> <br />The members are all competent musicians, but compared to, say, Dream Theater, I'd classify their playing as \\"tasty and atmospheric\\" rather than virtuoso. There is challenging stuff being played here, but it won't break any \\"notes per second\\" record.  <br /> <br />My personal rating would be 4 to 4.5 stars. It's a great little album, but I keep 5 stars for the ones that leave me floored when I hear them.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|I ordered this CD for my daughater and for myself.  My \\"ERIN\\" was thrilled to receive something she had loved for so long.  Neither of us knew the other was even aware of this beautiful, clear CELTIC sound. <br />I actually love the beginning music with the flute and harp as much as the rest of the clear, wonderful Irish music, sang in such a high soprano. <br />The results are inconceivable for a human voice to reach.
B000MRA5NS|2.0|Misconceived portrayal of James Bond 007 is not true to Ian Fleming's creation and cannot hold a candle to Sean Connery. No knowledge of food or champagne.

Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet
B000005YZM|5.0|This record has so many melodies, harmonies and hooks that just come one after another like a 60 foot wave.  The Zombies sophomore release puts so many other records to shame, with such an elegant grace.  The most unfortunate factor is that the band broke up as a result of the album not becoming as successful as it should have been.  <br /> <br />Love's \\"Forever Changes\\", is a good record.  The Beach Boys \\"Pet Sounds\\" is a really good record.  The Zombies \\"Oddessey and Oracle\\" is a Great record!  Now keep in mind almost all reviews are subjective.  However, if you live for discovering hidden treasures lost under the vast ocean of musical history then this is truly one of those great gems. <br /> <br />Rod Argent, the main writer for The Zombies is no household name like say Brian Wilson or any of the Beatles, but he may be just as clever as some of those legends.  The harmonies composed with Colin Blunstone are sheer beauty.  Songs like \\"Care of Cell 44\\", \\"Changes\\", and \\"Beechwood Park\\" are perfect examples.   <br /> <br />\\"A Rose For Emily\\", \\"Hung Up On A Dream\\"  and \\"Brief Candles\\" should have all been hit singles but most people have probably never even heard of these songs.  \\"Butcher's Tale\\" opens up like a Tom Waits song with a much gentler vocal performance.  It's eerie and spooky, but definitely cool.  \\"Time of the Season\\" is their biggest hit and pretty much the only hit from this album.  This song is incredible, and once again I will rave about the hooks present.  This song is an anthem for it's time.   <br /> <br />\\"Oddessey and Oracle\\" is now hailed by artists and critics as a wonderful record full of illuminating pop songs.  This album may have been overlooked during it's release but it's never too late to appreciate quality music.  This is one of the great ones.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|This movie cannot hold a candle to Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  Gene Wilder simply outperforms Depp as Wonka.  Nice visual effects, but the older version is simply much better.

Melt, ye <br />darn snow, I wanna dig some clay!
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I really think this movie is the best that Will Smith has done, and I liked that his real life Son played his Son in the movie.<br /><br />The movie is based on a true story of a man who was dealt more than his share of bad luck, grief,burdens and poverty.<br /><br />Nothing just seems to go his way at all. His wife gets tired of the daily struggle to make ends meet, and she leaves him alone to raise his Son on a meager salary, and times just keep getting tougher for him.<br /><br />They continue to move down in the world instead of up, and finally, they are homeless, and have to stand in a line every night to get a bed in a homeless shelter. It is so very sad, and you really feel for these characters!<br /><br />Things begin to change however, when he sees what stockbroker's make, and gets into a competetive internship, where out of 20 people, only one will make it. While he is studying for this, He not only has the pressure of work, but has raising his Son to deal with.<br /><br />Of course all his ambition pays off, and it is a joy to see things turn around for him-FINALLY!!!<br /><br />This is really a movie to cheer about.I am sure if you see this that you will love it! It is Will Smith at his very best, and in the most tender role I have ever seen him in!
B000HC2LI0|4.0|The DVDs are not great quality for the first season (4:3) because that was how it was produced but the rest of the 8 seasons are wide screen and look much improved.<br /><br />For the price, if you are a West Wing fan and you want more than 2 seasons this is the way to go.<br /><br />I was impressed with the quality of the box and it closes with a embedded magnet of all things!<br /><br />The extras on the DVDs are the same (or similar) to the ones you get on the season box sets. The big difference is that the DVDs here are single sided (4 shows per disc) while the individual season box sets are double sided. I think that makes this set just look bigger but since the price it better than buying them individually it does not matter. The quality seems the same.<br /><br />+ Good price if you want more than one season<br />+ Good packaging<br /><br />- First season quality is ok (but what do you expect from an old TV show that was filmed 4:3.<br />- The contrast seems a bit washed out at times.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Very haunting, very enthralling and the actors were all fantastic, its only sad that Ms. Biel dies--after only ONE night with Edward Norton....tragic.
B000063V8R|4.0|This season is worth purchasing for the finale episode alone.  Patrick Stewart made a simply wonderful borg, and seeing Riker in command with the feisty blonde as his 2nd made that episode (in our opinions) the best in the entire series!  When it viewed on the original air date we both remember literally standing up and cheering when \\"Locutus\\" came on screen! <br /> <br />The season also includes our second favorite episode of the series, \\"Q Who\\" where Q is banned from the continuum and forced to become human.  That episode was pure fun!  The biggest disappointment of the season was the return of the wimpy Dr. Crusher.  We had really hoped that Dr. Pulaski would last for several seasons at least (if not the entire series!); she was so much better and stronger in the role as Chief Medical Officer--her you could believe people would follow as a leader in a military operation!   <br /> <br />Overall, the third season was a very good one, and it was exciting to see it end with a bang (and a cliffhanger!), ensuring its continued existence... very satisfying for those of us who wish the original series had seen the same continued success.
B000002UAI|3.0|I received Beatles '65 as a Christmas present on December 25th, 1964. Several months later a relative in the UK sent me Beatles For Sale as a birthday present. I must have played '65 many times as I have a second vinyl copy, purchased in 1980.<br /><br />After the stellar A Hard Day's Night this record is mildly disappointing. From the very beginning I always felt that the Beatles' original compositions surpassed the covers. This is not a knock at the quality of the covers. The Motown songs covered on With The Beatles are uniformly excellent. The lesser known songs covered on Please Please are also first-rate. It is, rather, that I want more Beatles music. The reversion to six non Beatles tunes is therefore a regression.<br /><br />The cd starts off promisingly with three dark originals. Rock and Roll Music is a good tune, well done. Sun and Moonlight keep things going nicely. However, Kansas City sounds like filler. It destroys my flow and my mood. Side two is choppy. I love Eight Days, Every Little Thing and What You're Doing. Unfortunately these excellent Beatles songs are surrounded by a couple of Carl Perkins songs that, well, honestly, I do not like! I now realize why I tended to play Beatles `65 and not Beatles For Sale. Side one of the North American vinyl is superb - No reply, I'm a Loser, Baby's in Black, Rock and Roll Music, Follow the Sun, Mr. Moonlight. Side two is marred only by Honey Don't. We also add She's a Woman and I Feel fine and drop the other Perkins song and the Buddy Holly tune Words of Love. Sounds like a good deal to me! This is a case of less being more. Therefore, three stars for  original UK release and four for Beatles 65.
B000NA28I4|3.0|`Eragon', directed by Stefen Fangmeier, is based on a screenplay by Peter Buchman, from the first novel by teenaged author Christopher Paolini. To point out that the story is loosely based on themes from and the style of the `Lord of the Rings' films is less interesting than to say that it is also based heavily on themes from `Star Wars' and Anne McCafferty's `Dragonriders of Pern' series, both of which are themselves heavily influenced by the `Lord of the Rings' novels first published in 1955 through 1958 and even more so on the first Middle Earth quest described in `The Hobbit'. So, since Tolkien's tales from Middle Earth have had a pervasive influence on fantasy fiction and role-playing gaming for the last 50 years, we must take their influence as a given and move on. The immediate influence on the novel and the movie is not Tolkien's books so much as the great success of the `Lord of the Rings' movies. I also detect some influences from the Matrix trilogy in some scenes, although these influences are minor.<br /><br />The problem now faced by `Eragon' the movie is that with the `Lord of the Rings' movies, Peter Jackson's realization of J.R.R. Tolkien's story has raised the bar so high, practically no one outside of fantasy creative powerhouses such as Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas have the juice to put the kind of creative energy and money into a film to match Jackson's benchmark. The film version of `The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' comes close, but basically served as a proof of my contention that even with a classic script based on a C. S. Lewis' novel and all the resources of the Disney studios, we get a movie which at best comes in a distant second to `Rings'.<br /><br />It may be just a bit less obvious than with `The Fellowship of the Ring', but `Eragon' story is clearly the opening chapter of a series. Virtually the only area where `Eragon' is superior to `Fellowship' is that like the first (Episode IV) `Star Wars' flick, the story is fairly self-contained, with a reasonably satisfying ending. Otherwise, the story is weaker than `Fellowship'. My first observation is that while `Fellowship' had at least fourteen (14) interesting characters, `Eragon' has barely three, and that's counting the dragon. `Fellowship' had the nine members of the fellowship plus Bilbo Baggins, Arwen Evenstar, Elrond, Galadrial, and Saruman. And that's not counting the black riders, Barliman Butterbur and the Balrog! I count Jackson's greatest achievement with the filming of `Rings' is his (and Elijah Woods) making the character of Frodo Baggins interesting and sympathetic. Through countless readings of `Rings', I could never shake the notion that Frodo was a wimp. In the movie, he is beset with doubt, but he does not come off as a wimp! So, compared to the character of Eragon, the filmed Frodo Baggins is much more interesting. Eragon's mentor, played well by Jeremy Irons, is simply no match for Viggo Mortensen's realization of `Ring's Strider / Aragorn character. Again, I was never entirely happy with Aragorn on the written page. Director and actor really make the most of his character.<br /><br />While there was no dragon in `Rings', we do get a superb realization of an intelligent, speaking dragon in the gloriously limned picture of the great Smaug in `The Hobbit'. In comparison, our friendly dragon Saphira, voiced by Rachel Weisz, carries her own.<br /><br />The primary heavy, the `shade', in the employ of king Galbatorix (a waste of the talents of John Malkovich) is no match for the heavies in `Fellowship', that being primarily the black riders (who still give me nightmares after reading about them one late Saturday night, forty years ago), the Balrog, and the Uruk-hai (Saruman's own special breed of orc).<br /><br />When it comes to pivotal scenes, `Eragon' pales in comparison to `Fellowship'. One can claim that Jackson actually drags out some scenes just a bit too much to milk them for all they are worth, but I totally forgive him for his totally convincing realization of the encounter between Gandalf and the Balrog. Director Fangmeier has nothing that comes even close.<br /><br />The other speaking characters in `Eragon' seem to never be adequately introduced or explained, and in the world of grand mythical fiction, that is the cardinal sin, as it is the primary legacy of Tolkien's work. In no other world of science fiction or fantasy do we have the depth of realized legend, language and lore as in Tolkien. McCafferty in `Dragonriders' and Lucas in `Star Wars' come close, and that is why the work as well as they do.<br /><br />The director's commentary on this DVD was interesting, but it failed to provide much of the mythical background I so much want in works like this. This is a fair effort, but the series has a long way to go to come up to its legendary model.tally forgive him for his totally convincing realization of the encounter between Gandalf and the Balrog.

B000NA28I4|3.0|Let me start by saying I am an adult in my 40s and I really enjoyed the books!  Yes, the writing is a little immature in book one (it gets better in Eldest), and the plot is something of a rehash.  Big hairy deal, LOTR fans need to get over themselves already!!!  It still is a fun read, and I was really looking forward to the movie. <br /> <br />Biggest weakness--103 minutes, what are you kidding me??  The first \\"act\\" up to the part where Saphira flies was very well done.  Yes, they changed a lot from the book, but I thought it still captured the spirit of the books.  Jeremy Irons was not what I expected for Brom, but he's such a terrific actor I found myself liking him anyway.  However, they really should have added 5 or 10 minutes in there to show an implied time span and a scene where Eragon helps Saphira pick her name (with or without talking to Brom first, as he does in the book).  The sudden growing up thing just came across as stupid, and from there the movie morphed into breakneck speed so fast to be virtually unenjoyable.  The day after we watched the film, my teen son and my spouse both separately asked if we could sit down and watch \\"the rest of the movie\\"!!  (We saw the normal edition, not realizing there was a 2-disk with cut scenes at least!!) <br /> <br />There was also an annoying lack of attention to character details.  Some of this could have been solved by adding more time to the film (even the 17 minutes to make it a full 2-hour film would have been appreciated!!), but some of it was just sloppy inattention to detail.  The man with the beard who was maybe 3\\" shorter than Eragon at best seemed to have been intended as a dwarf.  The director explains in his commentary that he \\"wanted to do something different\\" with the urgals by neglecting their horns and/or heavy makeup, but what he mainly did differently was nothing at all!!  Their red eyes was the only thing that helped us recognize them as anything other than rather dirty poorly dressed humans!We can forgive the director for casting Arya as blonde, but could he not spare a couple of dollars in his budget to give her pointy ears??  Elves are portrayed differently in different books, I realize, but ALL of them have pointy ears, and as it was she came across as some kind of human amazon woman.  :(  Galbatorix also needed... something.  He came across as whiney with bad dialogue, not evil or frightening.  This is all the director and screenplay, as Galbatorix does not appear in the first book at all (except as a topic of conversation). <br /> <br />The film is still a fun watch though, and they definitely took pains to make it family friendly.  The special effects on Saphira were really wonderful!!  I gave it 3 stars largely for this reason alone, because if the dragon was bad the whole movie would be hopeless.  I thought the casting overall was very good, and the actors did a good job of pulling it off even when the lines were rather lame on occasion.  Although they changed a lot from the book, I thought it still would have worked if they had just stretched the length enough to make it work.  My biggest disappointment in terms of changes was the fighting scene with the shade at the end riding his smoke monster.  If the shade was as powerful as all that, why did he bother listening to the mewling Galbatorix?  It just didn't work within its own plot, as well as changing too much and wasting screen time that could have been devoted to developing the characters and story.
B000002UAF|5.0|Boy, things really moved quickly in 1964!  On December 26th, 1963 I Wanna Hold Your Hand was released in the US. On February 9th Ed Sullivan introduced the Fab Four to American audiences. Almost 41% of the US population watched. By April 4th The Beatles occupied the top five spots on the Billboard \\"Hot 100\\". Their third LP, A Hard Day's Night was released on July 10th. The movie, filmed during 16 weeks in the spring, debuted in July in the UK and in August in North America. Before the year was out Beatles For Sale (In North America this was re-named, we lost a few songs, gained a few - it was released as Beatles '65) had hit the shelves. In the midst of all this the band toured the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the US (twice). I saw them on September 7th at Maple Leaf gardens in Toronto - last row, greys, $4.00!  That the Beatles were able to write and record such a uniformly excellent LP as AHDN is a real testament to their immense creative talents.<br /><br />As is so often the case the band starts off the record with a memorable sound. - George's instantly recognizable Rickenbacker. What follows are thirteen gems. There isn't a weak song amongst them and there are several masterpieces - the title track, If I Fell, And I Love Her and Can't Buy Me Love. I think that the songs that complete the album, that missed the cut for the movie, are just as strong as those that were included. The first Beatles LP had strong covers and some nice originals. The second had terrific originals. With this release Lennon and McCartney really hit their stride. I've listened to each of these songs dozens of times and I still get goose bumps.  After a slight stumble with their next (Beatles For sale) the band never broke stride again.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Spoiler Alert!! <br /> <br />Not as musical as [[ASIN:B00005QW5X Hedwig and the Angry Inch (New Line Platinum Series)]] (even though there are more songs on the [[ASIN:B000IOMXZ8 Shortbus]]), not Porn, and definately not what everybody was expecting from the talented John Cameron Mitchell as a follow up to his tour-de-force. <br /> <br />It didn't make back its initial budget in its U.S. run.  But this Little Movie that Could did something much more amazing, it reached right out there and touched folks.  Some it touched in the gut.  Some ran from the theatre, demanding their money back.  Some laughed at the silly parts.  Some laughed at the sad parts. <br /> <br />But for those of us who it was designed for, it did something really amazing, it helped remind us that 9/11 didn't destroy us. It helped us recall the '60's (but as one character so wisely points out, without as much hope).   <br /> <br />Though there is hope, and joy, and laughter, and more actual sex (gay and straight) than any other movie you've seen without a second of porn in it.  All this, and a triumph of the human spirit. <br /> <br />My best friend went with me to see this film primarily because he'd really loved HaTAI.  He is a straight guy, he saw way more mano-a-mano love-makin' than he'd ever seen in his life, yet he was the one saying at the end how we needed to see it again, and soon.  So we went again. <br /> <br />Sure, the whole thing revolves around a woman who is unable to find her Big 'O'.  But it is essentially about how all the folks in this film are unable to connect.  It is like their lives are happening around them, but they can't really feel them, can't really let anyone know what they really need. <br /> <br />And in the end, they all get it. <br /> <br />So will you if you take a chance on this great little film. <br /> <br />Great music.  Silly singing sequences.  Non-simulated sex.  And best of all, a story about folks you'll come to love and care about.
B000062XFG|4.0|Although later seasons had more really good episodes and saw more development in the core characters, this season is worth buying just for the stellar performance of Diana Muldaur as Dr. Pulaski.  We never liked the character of Dr. Crusher, who was weak at best, and were greatly disappointed when she returned to replace the far superior Dr. Pulaski.  My families' favorite episodes were the one with Lor, Data's brother, and the one where Pulaski operates on Captain Picard, which did a great deal to develop the characters of Picard and Wesley Crusher as well as the good doctor.  We give it 4 stars for Diana Muldaur's sake.
B000002UAC|4.0|I arrived in Canada in April, 1963 having just attained the age of 14. The Beatles had released two relatively successful singles (Love Me Do, Please Please Me) in the months before my emigration. Their first LP was released at the end of March as I headed north to Liverpool to board ship. I arrived in Toronto and enjoyed the many pop music stations dotting the AM radio dial.  In the UK we had, at that time, just ONE station playing music for the teenagers - Radio Luxembourg. It really did emanate from the continent. Even in the south of England the reception was often poor. However, whilst I loved the accessibility of so much music I did miss the British voices that I had grown up with. I subscribed to NME. I read about the new breed of music exploding from Liverpool and else ware. The problem was that, in those days, Britmusic hardly got a spin in North America. This was about to change!<br /><br />In November, 1963 Capitol released \\"Beatlemania! With The Beatles\\" in Canada. It wasn't until 1990 that I realized that the first US release was so different. Anyway, this cd plays as I remember it. As I listen now and hear the last note of one song I know exactly what follows! It must indeed be disconcerting, as some have written, to listen to the cd and have different songs in a different order.<br /><br />Eight of the fourteen songs are Beatles originals. Those that aren't disclose precisely who influenced the fledgling Beatles - Motown's Holland, Berry and Bradford, Chuck Berry, Smokey Robinson. Although the boys do a more than creditable job with the covers the highlights of this record are the originals. From the opening chorus of It Won't be Long to the closing notes of Not a Second Time  it was obvious to everyone that a new era had begun in popular music. These lads were English, wrote their own best material, played their own instruments and looked completely different. To a fifteen year old today the look of the Beatles as shown on the album cover is unremarkable. In 1963 the look was revolutionary. We thought that their hair was just so long! We fought our parents when they insisted that we fans get our hair cut before it reached such lengths. And the music. It was truly like nothing that had preceded it. There are rockers & ballads. The rockers are carefree, let it rip, two minute blasts of youthful exuberance. There are no wasted seconds here. You could always rely upon the Beatles to start and finish their songs efficiently. No long and tiresome fade-outs here.<br /><br />So how do you rate such a landmark recording? As an eight song EP of purely original material this would undoubtedly be worth five stars. Although they do a solid job with the six covers, when all is said and done, they are just covers. So, let's say four stars. I suspect that this may be the last Beatles album meriting only four until Let it be.markable. In 1963 the look was revolutionary. We thought that their hair was just so long!

B000002UA9|4.0|This, The Beatles debut LP, was released in the UK in the spring of 1963. In my native Toronto it was released as Twist and Shout in February, 1964, two months after With the Beatles! My vinyl release includes From Me to You and She Loves You and omits I Saw Her Standing There and Misery. The liner notes are completely different from the UK and the US LPs.<br /><br /> Has any band launched its album career more auspiciously than The Beatles? Paul shouts \\"1 2 3 4\\", George enters the picture with his guitar, and then Paul begins to sing \\"Well she was just 17. You know what I mean...\\" Thirty seconds later the first loud \\"Whooooo!\\" Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your seat belts for the commencement of a six year musical ride of this or any other lifetime.<br /><br />There are eight originals and six covers - a pattern continued with their next LP. I have always felt that the covers here are more interesting than on With The Beatles. There is a miss-step (Honey) just as there would be later (Till There Was You). However, John's searing rendition of Twist and Shout more than makes up for that lapse of judgment. They also do a terrific job with the two Shirelles' songs, Boys and Baby it's You, making the songs their own rather than just parroting the original material.  The original material is mostly very strong.  Has anyone noticed that on the cd the credits for their own compositions are McCartney-Lennon while on the vinyl (my vinyl anyway) there are five where Paul's name comes first and three where John receives the lead credit. It is amazing what one discovers forty-three years and two months after buying the album! On With the Beatles all eight are L-M on both the record and the cd.<br /><br />The emergence of the Beatles in 1963 was a seminal moment in the history of popular music. From that point forward everything changed. Suddenly, and seemingly from nowhere, rock and roll groups (the word \\"band\\" didn't replace \\"group\\" for several decades) appeared. They certainly looked different. They played their own instruments and wrote much of their own material. They sang with abandon. They screamed and they whooped and they hollered. They had strange accents. As much as I loved, and still love, the professionally penned hits that seemed to dominate the early sixties ( Goff in-King, Lieber-Stoller, Neil Sedaka and many more) popular music had somehow lost its way after the mid-fifties when rock and roll burst upon the scene. It seemed as if we, the young, had discovered a form of music that we could call our own and then had it appropriated from us. The Beatles grabbed it and gave it back to us. Our parents were once again forced to start shaking their heads in bewilderment. As long as parents continue to do so music is on the right track!<br /><br />As a record of immense historical importance Please Please Me deserves the highest rating available. It deserves its own category. Had the Beatles never released another recording this would deserve five stars. However, we all know where they went so quickly and what they were capable of. And there is the fact of six covers and A Taste of Honey! If I give this five then what do I give Rubber Soul? Five with and asterisk?

6305897786|4.0|Even though this movie has received its fair share of scathing reviews, I must say I enjoyed it. I read the book too, and yes, the movie does not do justice to the book, nevertheless I found the movie to be entertaining. Johnny Depp is famous for playing understated roles, and here he plays the ruthless book dealer Corso with a measure of indifference, and yet, his character sucks you into the plot as he ventures deeper into a web of deceit & evil. Frank Langella's Boris Balkan is intellectual and possessed of a greed for forbidden things. Lena Olin as the 'grieving widow' with devilish designs is sexy as always, but nothing more. I found the character of the 'guardian angel' who is always getting Depp out of trouble [played by Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner] to be the most intriguing...her glances and looks [esp those eyes] hint at something more sinister underlying the surface.<br /><br />The score is haunting...one gets the feeling there are malevolent forces at work, and permeable evil throughout the movie. Although some reviews found the movie to be plodding, I didn't...if you are a serious book collector as I am, then you will be able to understand the thrill of the hunt, oftentimes very ardous and slow as you search for that one elusive title...so here Corso's quest in tracking down the other two copies of the Nine Kingdoms & unearthing their secrets...only his quest takes him into a dark, forbidding world filled with devil worshippers, and a stranger who holds the real key to all his questions.
0812975219|3.0|As a mathematics teacher who was formerly in the world of business, I enjoyed Taleb's examination as to the hidden role of luck in success. Though other reviewers discuss some of the errors in reasoning, his overall message is a valuable one. <br /> <br />However, throughout my reading it, his style continually grated on me.  <br /> <br />First of all, it is often of a rambling nature, with long-winded philosophical expositions that did not speak to me. Some may enjoy it, but for someone who is not philosophically inclined, it can put you to sleep.  <br />Second, as others have said, he definitely comes across as an arrogant s.o.b., but it seems more born out of insecurity than intelligence. It almost seems like this is someone who was not popular in high school trying to vindicate himself through his intellectual pontificating, dropping names of authors he has read right and left. I can't point to a particular passage to highlight this, but it remains my overall impression after reading the book.   <br /> <br />To sum up, it wasn't a bad book, but I would have enjoyed the book more had it been more in the style of \\"Innumeracy\\" - more geared to the intelligent layperson than the intellectual elite.
B00005JM8V|5.0|This DVD set is very expensive.  The contents of this DVD is usually only obtained in libraries, research institutions and colleges.  Only after years of Amazon.com recommending this set to me did I finally caugh up the bucks to buy it and experience it for myself.<br /><br />One may ask why they should pay over $150.00 for his DVD collection.  Yet, if one desires to get a complete understanding of the Holocaust and it's result, there is not a better investment you can make!<br /><br />Unlike stereotypical black and white Army documentaries of the result of Hitler's \\"Final Solution,\\"  \\"Shoah\\" brings to light the personal human stories of the Holocaust, both from the side of the surviving perpretrators and the victims.  Also brought to light are the testimonies of the casual witnesses in the countries that were involved.  It is far more personal than Schindler's List.  It is over 9 hours of history in your face.<br /><br />No archival footage was used in this presentation.  It was filmed in the late 70's and early 80's by Claude Lanzmann.  He interviews hundreds of surviving victims, SS officers and native populations of that era.  Vividly through filming of the extermination camp sites, the \\"De-Jewed\\" villages in Poland, the forests where hundreds of thousands were burnt and buried, he brings the Holocaust to us in a personal, gut-wrenching manner.<br /><br />This is especially important today.  One must obtain a heartfelt experience of the Holocaust to appreciate the efforts of the hundreds of thousands of American lives sacraficed then to put an end to that mad \\"Thousand year Reich\\" that sponsored the industrial scale butchery of humanity.  Relying on the thousand year hatreds of ethnic groups in Europe, Hitler and his goons fanned those fires in the hopes of \\"purifying\\" humanity of those they personally hated.  Never in the history of humanity has this been possible until the Industrial Revolution made possible the machinery, technology and science required to make death an industry, where even the by-products of the butchery were a commodity.<br /><br />In this movie you will see aged Jewish survivors of the \\"Aktion Reinhard\\" program.  You will see them open up to Claude.  You will see them break down in tears as he makes them remember the horrors that will haunt them the rest of their days.  You will see many native Poles of that era, now as old people, as they reenact the slitting of their throats- the sign that they gave the trainloads of jews as they passed by them on their way to Treblinka.  You will see hidden camera interviews of some surviving SS personell of those camps.  As these people are being interviewed, Claude takes us on a visual tour of the camp properties as they appear today.<br /><br />It is as if ghosts come back to life.  We witness the ghosts of forgotten landscapes give up their dead to our view.<br /><br />I cannot more powerfully reccomend you to obtain a copy of \\"Shoah\\" whatever the price. These days we are assaulted by Holocaust deniers, whether thay are Neo-Nazis spewing their excuses and hatreds through the media of Community Television of the internet, or Presidents of countries!  Worst of all, there are even regimes in the world who sponsor Anti-Holocaust conventions in their country to discount and deny the reality of the Final Solution.  This film is neccesary for everyone to examine the truth and examine their conciousnesses.  ONLY through personal experience that this film depicts can collective humanity purify their souls so \\"never again\\" can such inhumanity and horror be revisited upon the world.<br /><br />After viewing this film, you will never hear a train whistle in the same way again!<br /><br />Look at the cover of this DVD set.  You can see that aged train engineer, and the sign Treblinka.  What you can't see there is shown in this film.  It is that same engineer slitting his throat with his finger after the train passes that sign!  All the people shown in this film have now died.

B00000K29E|5.0|Simply titled Big Brother & The Holding Company (1967), the album is Janis's one attempt to be part of a group ensemble instead of the \\"star.\\" The performances are proof-positive that Janis never succeeded at blending in - she had too much power. In the opening number, \\"Bye, Bye Baby,\\" Janis's voice is double-tracked. Thanks to the elegant re-mastering job, the raw beauty of that performance can now be fully appreciated. The group itself produced a fine debut album, but it's doubtful that the album would have been treated to such a lavish re-mastering job without the historical connection that Joplin provided. This is the best of the San Francisco sound: raw, driven rock where the musicians were genuinely talented.  Sounds great!!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Image Quality, Cinematography, Content, Narration, Accomplishment, Innovation... THIS SERIES IS GREAT!    I am a Discovery, Science Channel, National Geographic, etc fan and watch more TV than I probably should.  Of all the nature series that I can remember, this is easily the one I like the best.  Its content is divided into types of environments (mountains, deserts, caves, etc.) therefore, you travel around the world in each episode.  They include spectacular imagery from space.  The explanations are not too detailed, they point out the biggest facts and the unique details about each scene; informational enough to enjoy but not so much that you feel like taking notes.    This is a great series for anyone who even enjoys nature and it for those who have not gotten into it, it provides a great primer.  Image quality and great cinematography make everything look more interesting and spectacular.  Unlike many documentaries where you feel as an outsider looking at the subjects/situations, many of the scenes have managed to make me feel as if I were part of the action.    ...if you own an HD system I cannot think of a better use for it.      enjoy!
B000LXH0AE|4.0|This is story of ordinary man who becomes involved in an extraordinary tale. Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS Agent who lives a monotonous and mundane life. But one day starts hearing the voice of a women with an British accent narrating his life. He really wakes up to the reality of the situation when the narrator says that he will die. After seeking some help from a psychologist and eventually a literature professor, Jules Hilbert, played by the ever brilliant Dustin Hoffman, he begins to explore a life he only dreamed of living. And as with all the best stories there is a love story at the epicentre of this tale.<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the contemptuous and rowdy Ana Pascal, a direct opposite of Harold Crick. She tempts him, teases him and confronts him. They begin a love affair that drives Harold's life into new territory. Because he actually begins to care about his life. He enjoys is now because he is living his dreams. And he is having an adventure.<br /><br />Some of the best moments in this film is when Professor Hilbert instructs him to determine certain outcomes. Like whether he is in a comedy or a tragedy. And also whether he is in control of the plot or the writer/narrator. And while he spends the whole day in his house, not even going to the bathroom or answering the phone, the dreaded answer is revealed. A crane smashes through his living room as the complex is about to be demolished. The conclusion - it turns out the writer is in control and Harold has to accept his destiny.<br /><br />There is moments of madness, moments of laughter, and moments of angst coupled with beautiful cinematography in this film. And it reminded me so much of [[ASIN:B0009UC7QQ The Truman Show (Special Collector's Edition)]]Truman Show with Jim Carrey.<br /><br />Anyway this is a film that stretches the imagination just a little bit. You may discover you are in fact the writer of your own destiny. So like Harold Crick take action. Don't wait until it's to late. After all you are going to live the rest of your life in the future.t's to late. After all you are going to live the rest of your life in the future.

B000NDIAWY|5.0|A little more sombre than her stunning eponymous debut, 'The Story' is another excellent album by Brandi Carlile. Her wonderful voice is on centrestage here more than the first album. It allows her to display the full power and range of her voice. <br /> <br />The album lacks the lighter moments from her first album. Most of the songs here are darker in tone and so is the music. However, this fails to bog the album down, and it's still a great listen from start to finish. It grows on you at every listen, as the depth of the songwriting reveals itself. Don't forget to listen to the hidden track 'Hiding My Heart' at the very end. <br /> <br />My personal favourites include the title track, the strident 'My Song', 'Cannonball', the beautiful 'Downpour' (which really shines on the album compared to her various live performances) and 'Hiding my Heart'.
B00001OH7U|5.0|a fantastic and profound album that comes to new light with this  version. It is truly a timeless work that shines in any form. Captures Bowie in his occultish-musing incarnation and of course adding brilliance to the classic \\"wind.\\"
B000N6U0E2|3.0|Watchable film, based on real-life story, about young African-American father, Chris Gardner, and his son (played by Smith's real son). Smith's character is doing poorly selling an overpriced med-tech bone density scanner to physicians. He applies for an internship to become a stockbroker at Dean Witter, but there is no pay. He can't pay his bills, and his wife leaves him. He is evicted from two different rental units, spends a night in jail, and nights in homeless shelters and subways (always in the company of his son). Everything bad that can possibly happen to him does happen. It happens so much that I was uncomfortable watching much of it. I think what is missing from the film is any in-depth relationships that Chris Gardner has with anyone besides his son. They seem to be alone in an indifferent world. He doesn't seem to have anyone he can turn to for help and support. There is closure at the end, but it's questionable whether it is enough to balance out the titanic struggles Chris goes through to find his \\"happyness\\" (and yes, the misspelling IS explained in the movie).

0205313426|5.0|I have obviously learned a lot from this little book as shown in my title. OK, all kidding aside it is a book that is simple to read for a manual and as others have stated it is actually interesting. For a grammar book that has got to be a first. Now I know that Woe is I and The Richard Lederer books are enjoyable but they are not exactly manuals and came after this book anyway. I like this book quite a bit and would recommend it to anybody looking for some help. Now It is not going to replace APA, Chicago or MLA as much as I wish it would; but it will be an instrument for your good. PS. If any of you grammar aficionado's wish to edit my post, you may feel free to do so.
0375831002|5.0|It's rare to find a book that makes you cry before the first 100 pages are up. This one succeeded spectacularly. I was touched by everything because from the first moment, I felt like I really knew the characters well. I cared about them and related to them.<br /><br />The thing is, I thought at first this would be a typical WWII novel. For the most part, they describe Jews struggling to get along. I bought this tentatively at a used bookstore, and discovered that I loved it. 550 pages went by like 200. I couldn't put it down. I cried at least seven times, and I don't usually cry more than once in even the most touching books. Maybe it has something to do with the narrarator. After all, Death did tell us a about things many times, causing a tear to escape here or there.<br /><br />Because that's how it is. Unlike most books, this is narrarated NOT by a character IN the story, but by an outside character who occasionally joins us. There are light moments, too, when Death sticks in a silly definition or some funny comment. The style of the book is so unique and wonderful to read that I honestly want it to continue even after it's over. I don't want the STORY to continue, but the book. Zusak wrote something incredible here, and I can't put it down.<br /><br />\\"The Book Thief\\" isn't just about one girl. It's not just about one problem. It goes over growing up in Germany during the war. It shows the internal struggles of some people, and the very external ones too. Liesel is a very real-feeling girl, with her nightmares, her outbursts... and her occasional kleptomania.<br /><br />This book surprised me, and was well-worth everything. If given the opportunity, I would steal it, it's so good. Every moment with Liesel is a moment with a fascinating child-hero, but the book is not for children. Liesel's life isn't for children either, and this is part of what makes the book so good. Death's stories add so much too, giving us a general background to the world at the time, and the war. Often, it is Death's little anecdotes that reveal things before their time, and then by the time the even comes around, it's even more powerful.<br /><br />\\"The Book Thief\\" is so well-written. It's well done. It grabbed me from the first moment, and didn't let go. Even at the end, I want to go back and reread it all over again. It's touching. It's amazing.<br /><br />Buy it. Borrow it. Don't steal it, because that's illegal. READ it. It's amazing. It's wonderful. Highly recommended. Just know that you're missing out on so much if you don't read it.ime, and the war.

0060005424|4.0|I've finished \\"Abhorsen\\" now, so it's easier to come back and write this review. I say that because \\"Lirael\\" doesn't qualify as a stand alone novel. \\"Sabriel\\" did, no doubt about that, but as you head toward the end of \\"Lirael\\" few of the major struggles/issues are resolved. (Well, some minor ones are, but the big ones are entirely left until the end of \\"Abhorsen\\".) I think it's fair to say that. The book certainly held my interest, but I was surprised - not really pleasantly - when it ended with everything left open.  <br /> <br />That said, together \\"Lirael\\" and \\"Abhorsen\\" make a marvelous two-volume story. Admittedly, both Lirael and Sameth are pretty annoying at times. Lirael is so caught up in a dream of belonging that it takes her too long to acknowledge the ever-growing evidence of her special abilities. And Sameth can be a drip in a variety of ways. A lot of people have commented on this, and I'm glad to say that, although frustrating, Nix does bring the story and the characters home and makes something wonderful from their flaws. <br /> <br />Mogget remains interesting - when he's awake. The Disreputable Dog is even more fun, though. It's a pleasure to watch his relationship with Lirael develop. By the way, I'm an adult. I think this series is enjoyable both for a YA audience and for older readers. It's smart and unique. Start with \\"Sabriel\\", of course, but this series is definitely worth your time.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I bought the dvd \\"Pursuit of Happiness\\" while I was in Mongtomery.  This has got to be one of Will's best movies.  He really set it off in the movie.  It was a powerfull story of struggle.  I enjoyed this movie from the begining to the end.  It helps remind you that not every wealthy person had it easy or just given to them.  It reminds to you to focus on what YOU want and to go after it no matter what roadblocks may be thrown in front of you!<br /><br />Oh yea, can't forget how precious lil' Jaden was in the movie.  He's going to be a heartbreaker!!!!  This movie is worth adding to YOUR movie collection!!!
B000C4SHRW|5.0|I gave \\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Lirael\\" positive reviews at a four-star level. This one closes out the series in a way that deserves that fifth star. There's nothing surprising in terms of the characters heading toward ever more difficult challenges - most of which seem completely insurmountable. You know you're going to get that, and you know the characters are largely going to find the ways to prevail.<br /><br />What's great about this is that Nix's characters find surprising answers to the things challenging them. As the novel heads towards it conclusion many different threads are tied together into a satisfying, surprising and emotionally involving conclusion. I enjoyed it right up the end, and I recommend it to all readers of quality fantasy. Be sure to start with the earlier novels, though. It would be a shame to start at the end, especially as so much of what makes this one special are things first begun in \\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Lirael\\".
0375507256|5.0|While I agree with another reviewer that this is not a \\"difficult\\" book, it is also not for the casual reader. It requires patience and sometimes careful reading to get the most out of it. I was tempted from time to time to jump chapters and to follow one of the six storylines in sequence rather than as they are presented. I resisted, and I'm glad I did. Each reader will have their favorite; after some initial difficulty, I fell in love with Zachary's voice (a futuristic Huck Finn!) and with the humor of Timoth Cavendish. For lovers of literary fiction with multiple themes and storylines, you are in for a real treat. I also highly recommend listening to the audio version, with each of the six storylines read by different actors. The language jumps to life, particularly in the two episodes I mentioned above. When you feel overwhelmed, you can consult your hard copy for reference. I found this the best way to enjoy the novel completely.
0140620664|5.0|I am not really a Jane Austen fan per-se but I have to admit Mansfield Park is a top ten classic read and this particular edition has pride of place on my bookshelf.<br /><br />Welcome to the world of Fanny Price, the impoverished niece of a English Baronet, Sir Thomas Bertram who is taken from her squalid overcrowded family home in Portsmouth and raised in abject gentility amongst her four cousins, Tom the heir to his father's estate, Edwin the spare to the heir and the two girls, the spiteful but spirited Maria and the air headed Julia.<br /><br />Add to this brood, their mother, the indolent Lady Bertram who can only sit on a sofa with her pugs and look pretty (how she had four children in the first place is beyond me!), her sister, the social climbing Mrs Norris who endeavors to put across a show of piety and and humility but is in fact and out and out snob who has no love for the gentle but surprisingly shrewd Fanny who fools everyone in the household and gets her man in the end.<br /><br />This is what I love about Mansfield Park, on one level it is a love story in which the deserving heroine gets her man in the end after much trial and tribulation and even saves the day after a fashion.  On another level it is darkly clever, with sharp portrayals of human nature in alls its prickly glory.  The Crawfords are a brother and sister enjoying their personal fortunes by living recklessly and fashionably.<br /><br />In turn another character Mr Rushworth is a buffoon who owns a manor house which turns a good income and with whom Julia marries not out of love but from avarice, her desire to \\"be someone\\" blinds her to her real passion, Mr Crawford who is happy to take what she offers him but not marry her even when they elope together, causing a terrible scandal in the family.<br /><br />Comic distraction comes in the form of the aforesaid Mrs Norris who is wonderfully grotesque, she fawns over Lady Bertrams children, not one of them worth their salt, even Edwin who is likable but lets be honest he is just a milksop, puts Fanny down whenever she gets the chance, and sees her as the \\"lowest and the last\\" not even family really though she is her younger sister's daughter and also the niece of the indolent and worthless Lady Bertram.<br /><br />All in all Mansfield Park is a very satisfying book, it has a few cliches but I would like to think that Austen has put these in her novel on purpose, deliciously witty, sparkling and full of intelligent humor, this is a book well worth its five stars and more.likable but lets be honest he is just a milksop, puts Fanny down whenever she gets the chance, and sees her as the \\"lowest and the last\\" not even family really though she is her younger sister's daughter and also the niece of the indolent and worthless Lady Bertram.<br /><br />All in all Mansfield Park is a very satisfying book, it has a few cliches but I would like to think that Austen has put these in her novel on purpose, deliciously witty, sparkling and full of intelligent humor, this is a book well worth its five stars and more.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This is one of the few movies I can think of that has so much extra material in in addition to the movie, that the extras are actually as good as the movie! No filler here; after watching this great film, I spent another hour seeing a terrific feature about the Italian Director and his approach to movie making, which was very well done; an interview with the real life character,and his evolution into who has become something of a diplomat, and an excellent segment on Will Smith and his son, and the dynamics of their relationship.  All of these \\"extras\\" are almost essential to the context ofthe film, and I tell friends who have seen the theatrical version to rent the DVD simply for the wonderful bonus features, which are at least an hour of fascinating material. Buy the DVD, watch the movie, it was terrific, then kick back and spend an hour or so with the cast and crew. Remarkable!

B000MXPE7O|4.0|This is a movie that you must pay close attention to at all times or you may get lost in the twists and turns. It's a good thriller with a complicated plot and worth the rewinds if you do have to watch again to digest everything between and during the flashbacks.

B000ICM5VW|5.0|This one's a big movie! Three hours and eight minutes of a very watchable version of King Kong.<br /><br />Excellent HD DVD video and audio (Dolby Digital Plus 5.1) transfer.

Great special effects, although a couple of the scenes are too computery to captivate through subsequent viewings.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film; however, this film does contain a few scenes that are unsuitable for impressionable young children.
0140187650|2.0|As a lifelong admirer of Hannah Arendt, especially her thrillingly suggestive \\"The Human Condition,\\" I was surprised, when I finally picked up her \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem,\\" to find it a poor account of the subject: disorganized, digressive, meandering. Arendt seems to start the story in the middle and assume too much background from her readers, a fault that grows only more irritating with the distance of time. Every straightforward discussion soon degenerates into a thicket of scholarly throat-clearing and asides. This is the sort of thing best handled by a clear-eyed journalist who starts the story at the beginning, introduces every strand properly, nails every discussion with plenty of concreta, and never abandons the reader. Properly told, it should get more interesting as it proceeds; with Arendt, it only gets more obscure and tiring.

B00005JPCF|3.0|My wife and I, proud grandparents of a couple of children - one of them a highly verbal and bright 5 year-old Kindergartner - took her to see Happy Feet. Our decision was based, largely, on two factors. 1) The TV reviewers who raved about how appropriate it was for youngsters and 2) the trailers we saw ourselves in the theaters - none of which showed any of the frightening and suggestively gruesome parts. Thirsty-five minutes into the film, she was in Grandma's lap - and five minutes later - after covering her eyes at a scene showing the business parts of a leopard seal's mouth (though she thought it was a shark!) - looked at me saying, \\"Papa .... Why do they put this kind of scary stuff into a movie for kids ?!\\" And you know what?.... Her reactions and her question were both a lot more appropriate (and, incidentally, entertaining in their own way) that was the film itself - that we left after 40 minutes of, going home to play some Sorry, draw some pictures and practice reading and counting. These things were FUN for her - Happy Feet was not.<br /><br />Without getting into the details of the plot, the voices (well done by famous 'real' actors,) or the animation (nice drawings that mime naturalism) - suffice it to say that this is definitely NOT a film for children under 10-11 years old. Reviewers who say that it is suitable for younger kids simply either have been away from the company of young children for too long or are in the company of ones conditioned to be unafraid of this type of imagery. As a child therapist, I must say that the latter possibility is not a good sign interns of future development or the ability to discriminate frightening scenes from \\"fun entertainment.\\"<br /><br />The media 'hype' of this film has been extraordinary. And, for fans of detailed animation, I can see where this would be an interesting and entertaining film. For penguinism fans, the documentary showing real penguins (\\"The March Of The Penguins\\" is FAR superior) and covers much of the same material - sans, of course, the Hollywood requirement for created adventure and unnaturally frightening images.<br /><br />I like penguins. They, along with pandas, are perhaps amongst the cutest animals in the world - kids love them too. But in the venue of this film, they are vulnerable and as frightened as the production will leave many young children.<br /><br />One final word: As we were leaving, we could hear many of the young children in the theater complaining about being scared and beginning to cry. We were aware that their parents (or the adults who were with them) were not picking up on this heartfelt and honest cue and were staying there. Ultimately, this concerned us more than the inappropriateness of the film itself for young children. Adults who don't listen to them.<br /><br />If your kids are 10 -11 years old and don't mind a little scare and a lot of cute - Happy Feet may be a good couple of hours spent. If not, find something to do with them that does not describe fright as fun.

0440236304|5.0|This is one of the best first hand accounts of combat ever written.  Within a mere 200 pages<br /><br />the author manages to bring across the harrowing ordeals the paratroopers went through<br /><br />preparing for and then invading Normandy.  I have heard stories about the same war from my<br /><br />grandparents, and what I found amazing is that the book feels like a transcript of such stories,<br /><br />and I mean this in a good way.  My grandparents recounted their experiences in the form of a series of<br /><br />anecdotes, observations, and remembrances of small details that may have seemed insignificant a the time,<br /><br />but stuck in their minds for more than 50 years.  This book has the very same feeling, with<br /><br />the remarkable exception that Donald Burgett is unflinching in his description of the horrors<br /><br />of combat, as well as his reactions to it.<br /><br />Be sure that you have set aside a few hours when you start reading the book, because it<br /><br />is almost impossible to put down.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Another review by PD's Daughter :<br /><br />The reason I bought this DVD is because I heard all about how wonderful it was and how it was deemed \\"the best BBC production ever.\\" Well I have to agree!! (actually I really love most of the BBC productions)<br /><br />After I watched this 233 minute program all in one sitting way past by bedtime (I just had to know what happened!!) I couldn't resist reading the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell (which is a really good book, it's now one of my favorites)... the movie is kinda like the book, although the production is (i confess) much better because of the modernization for us younger female watchers.<br /><br />The story begins with Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) at her cousin's wedding in London where she is talking to a young man (who would later propose to her but she would refuse) about how wonderful her country life is where her father is parson and her mother is a sweet yet delicate woman.<br /><br />Mr. Hale moves the entire family (including the maid Dixon) up North to the mill town of Milton (for a reason I wont tell!!!) and they are set up in a little house.<br /><br />Country girl Margaret absolutely hates the dirt and noise and the utter gruffness of the millworkers in Milton and the town itself.  But there is nothing Margaret hates more than the handsome, intellegent, lovely, mean, handsome mill owner John Thornton.<br /><br />Being an obsessed P&P watcher and reader, Mr. Thornton really reminded me of Mr. Darcy (accept much meaner) and well Richard Armitage is such a great actor and such a good looking man that I was very happy with the choice of him for Mr. Thornton.<br /><br />The choice of Margaret was a dissapointment.  In the book Margaret is suppose to be a strikingly beautiful young woman but I felt that Daniela Denby-Ashe was a little bit too Eastern European looking and tough.  I knew that she was making her voice sound very ... delicate... but I just felt that Margaret was not presented in the way that she should have -- strong willed, intelligent, and beautiful buuuut I did get over that by the end, the wonderfully romantic ending.<br /><br />In the romance department (which I'm quite aware of since I did a huge project on romance novels and I'm in love, literally in love, with Barbara Cartland) there were parts that just made me ... sigh.<br /><br />I especially loved how the writers of the script put in the \\"looking over the shoulder at Mr. Thornton\\" and added that part in the swirling snow where Mr. Thornton squints his eyes and hoarsly whispers \\"look back..look back at me\\" ... sigh<br /><br />but the end... what can I say.. my heart flutters just thinking about it.  I wont tell you'll just have to watch it.<br /><br />The plot of the movie has a lot of twists and turns, and I feel is quite accurate to the time period of mills and unions, where the worker had no right and could only hope that their demands would be met through striking.  For some reason though, Mr. Thornton and Margaret are always in the right places and the right time to see the wrong things about each other.<br /><br />The entire story is a relationship built upon misunderstanding and confusion and about the supression of truly passionate feelings.  North and South is such a good movie and novel. I would HIGHLY recommend watching this incredible BBC production!d beautiful buuuut I did get over that by the end, the wonderfully romantic ending.

It's a delicious idea....to think that the happier, shinier, more successful people of this world have access to a certain \\"secret\\" that causes them to attract good things.  Unfortunately, as much as I hoped this book would blow me away, it didn't. <br /> <br />I found it difficult to stay awake while reading the first four chapters.  The same basic themes (\\"Your thoughts become things\\" and \\"The Great Secret of Life is the law of attraction\\") were repeated over and over again.  Mixed with the boredom was a sense of surprise that the book was so focused on material things.  A chapter called \\"The Secret to Money\\" came before chapters on Relationships, Health, \\"the World\\", You and Life, which definitely made me go \\"Hmmmm.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Secret\\" starts with a great idea, but develops a credibility problem when it uses All Or Nothing and Overly Simplistic language.  For example:   <br /> <br />(a)  \\"Nothing can come into your experience unless you summon it through persistent thoughts.\\"   This would seem to suggest that everyone working in the World Trade Center on 9/11/01 somehow INVITED the terror attack through their own persistent thoughts (which is, of course, pure hogwash.)  Or terminally ill cancer patients fighting for their lives... SUMMONED the disease.        <br /> <br />(b)  \\"You have two sets of feelings:  good feelings and bad feelings.  And you know the difference between the two because one makes you feel good, and the other makes you feel bad.\\"  This seems to wipe out several dimensions of human emotional experience.  What about ambivalence?  (\\"I'm happy about the job offer in LA but, gosh, I'll really miss my family and friends in Boston.\\")  Are we wiping out the conceptof bittersweet?  Isn't it a balance of a range of emotions that makes us human?   <br /> <br />It is fine to say that, within reason, what you take the time to visualize for yourself in glorious detail is more likely to manifest itself in your life, or even that you can accomplish things you never thought possible by first seeing yourself doing, feeling, and thinking like you have already accomplished them (and, of course, following up with massive action to get you where you want to go.)  I also realize that repetition and simple phrasing can be useful tools for teaching new concepts; however the scope of \\"The Secret\\" is too broad to use these techniques.  (We're trying to learn a new blueprint for life here, not how to care for a potted plant.)   <br /> <br />\\"The Secret\\" takes a valid concept to extremes.  The unrealistic wording is unnecessary and raised red flags that were distracting and interfered with my ability to remain open to the overall excellent and useful message of the book.  If you seek to learn more about the fascinating power of positive thought and creative visualization but do not wish to be brainwashed with extreme claims, then this book is probably not up your alley either. <br />
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I found this movie to be very entertaining.  Kevin was good and believable and Whitney was refreshing.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|I don't mind that this starts slow, and stays that way. But the casting seems off. Jolie can do many roles, yet this wasnt one of them. Damon does a decent job but at when his kid is a teen, he looks just a smidgeon older.  I think Clive Owen would have been perfect.  Damon falls more into a Cruise-like category.  The hugeness of the stars somehow detracts from the potential.  Deniro just does not pull it off as director.  he did a great job acting the part he played.  The woman who played the deaf chick was great. you really felt her plight.  None of the other characters came alive.  Jumping back and forth in time is very difficult and even with the not-so-subtle annotation on the screen, the jumps seem erratic and poorly timed, leaving the audience clamoring to follow the script.  In 20 years, someone should re-write the script, and re-make this.  It has a lot of potential. And leave the big name stars at home.  A lesser known can give the character more life, intrigue, and depth.
0792841344|5.0|I first saw this movie as a teenager at the theater.  After the movie, as my boyfriend and I were walking though the parking lot back to his car and guy with a deep voice came up from behind me and shouted \\"Boyyyy!\\" in a deep voice just like Angus Scrimm.  Well, I about peed myself.<br /><br />This movie is great.  Today my kids ejoy watching it and my son has a plaster mask of Angus Scrimm.  Speaking of Angus Scrimm, he is a legend in his own right.  The Tall Man will always have a place in my best nightmares.<br /><br />Recently I was happy to learn that he is still alive and kicking!  Perhaps they will make another sequel to Phantasm.  I would love to see The Tall Man back in action, terrifying Michael, Jody, Reggie, and millions of other daring souls!<br /><br />Watch this classic then run for your life!

B0000634EV|5.0|If you like your hard rock southern style, you really need to pickup both of the Down cd's.<br /><br />These release are fat and very full sounding. Phil is well Phil and his heavy voice and style of delivery only adds to what already is just a great piece of music. Seriously, both the Down releases are simply amazing sounding efforts with boatloads of feel and passion.<br /><br />These cd's have a very heavy groove to them and are truly righteous listens.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get these A.S.A.P.
6305558167|5.0|Simply put..this is the best sword and sorcery movie of all time. And....arguably, one of the best films of any genre. I wish there were more footage available of this movie. A nice long directors cut would be nice.
B00005JPCA|1.0|Sony's DRM protection will prevent this DVD from playing in many DVD players, and suprisingly several Sony DVD players also.  My Toshiba SD-4800 will not play this DRM protected DVD. <br /> <br />We were not able to watch the movie, no comment on how good it would have been.
B0009ML238|4.0|First of all, if you are wondering if this is some reunion or retrospective on the 60s folk-art band, Circus Maximus, the answer is no. But read on anyway.<br /><br />Second, if you've read most of the other reviews, there would certainly seem to be almost nothing but good things said by people, so why add another review? Because one reviewer observes that Circus Maximus are nothing more than a dated Dream Theater knock-off, and that if you already own \\"Images and Words\\" then you will have no need for this disc. And while it is almost certainly the case that this disc would appeal to Dream Theater fans, it does in fact have more to offer than just that.<br /><br />Two basic points first. Simply by coming 13 years after \\"Images and Words,\\" one could say that Circus Maximus take their inspiration there, rather than that they are derivative. Amongst blues guitarists, it is no crime to sound like your forebears. The same, then, may also be said for the instrumentation and some of the sound of the disc. However, it may not be correct to cite Dream Theater as the most likely \\"sounds-like\\" band; for that, Everon seems a better choice. And lastly, the most important difference is that Circus Maximus hail from Norway, that wellspring of modern metal that has birthed everything from Mayhem and Satyricon to Dimmu Borgir.  However \\"dreamified\\" their sound might be, there is still a Norwegian backdrop of sheer metal mania in it that Dream Theater has not ever boasted of. As such, this album might be too \\"metal\\" for some Dream Theater fans.<br /><br />\\"Sin,\\" the disc's opener at 5'53\\", kicks things off in grand no-nonsense style right off the bat.  I don't want this review merely to be a song-by-song comparison of this and \\"Images and Words\\" but at a bare minimum, the sound here is bigger, and the riffs are very much more Nordic than Dream Theater's. Different strokes for different folks, of course, but there /is/ a difference here.  In fact, until the vocals kick in, it seems unlikely that Dream Theater comparisons would occur at all. Once they do, however, the difference will again be noted as pointed out by another reviewer: the lyrics describe a murder from five points of view. Also, the song's break in particular veers into an area of greater sheer intensity than almost anything in the Dream Theateresque genre; if there is a fault to be found here, it is in the band not stretching this section out more<br /><br />\\"Alive,\\" at 5'38\\", is more recognizable from the very beginning as Dream Theater, but considerably heavier. In fact, the whole song up to the finale is a rather heady mishmash of different kinds of metal gestures, including (very amped up) 80s hair metal, and even Pantera's \\"Cemetery Gates\\" (for about 2 seconds). To the extent that originality frequently consists of different structural combinations of existing styles, the way this song makes it way through these gestures is fairly interesting. But it's at the finale, \\"Together we will make it through alive,\\" that the song really jumps out of the speakers. The vocalist's high, sustained note plays against a suddenly rather jagged, Gothic riff, which somehow throws everything that went before in the song into a strange, or unsettling light.<br /><br />\\"Glory of the Empire,\\" at 10'27\\", is the second-longest song, and might seem strange subject for a metal band outside of England, except that the lyrics merely recount a warrior-type's realization that he has contributed to an unjust cause, an empire \\"built by the hands of slaves to fulfill the master's will\\". Although the song is not terribly captivating up to its bridge, it manages to get through 5'30\\" rather quickly. Around 6 minutes, the music becomes more lush, and a piano and vocal bit provides a welcome relief from the somewhat trudging first half.  This bridge becomes properly vast, melodic, with a slightly mis-mixed piano and guitar duo before the guitar-bridge itself.  The vocals return, with a decidedly more martial stomp to the music, and the piece begins to make its way to the end conventionally. If nothing else, this song does not seem to drag despite its length.<br /><br />\\"Biosfear,\\" at 5'22\\", is the album's only instrumental. Once again, it kicks off with a riff that will remind one of Dream Theater (primarily due to the guitar tone, and guitar-keyboard interplay), but this lasts only 41 seconds, before launching into a progressively slowing set of three riffs (the first a series of linear variations, the second a satisfying bunch of varying time signature licks, and then an octave growling thing). After that, it gets more complicated &lt;hah>, including an adorable jangly keyboard section, banged out of the park by heavy swinging thing with two of the best placed power chords ever I'd venture, followed by the obligatory extended guitar showpiece. The piece ends first with the usual arpeggiated finger riffs on guitar and base, followed by full-band workout--and while one can mentally connect this back to Dream Theater, if you weren't predisposed to do so, you wouldn't. In all, a crazy little tour de force which has great relistenability, unlike many similar types of pieces.<br /><br />\\"Silence from Angels Above,\\" at 4'07\\", is the album's ballad, including falling rain (to match the lyrics) and a somewhat ill-advised keyboard wash. This certainly is not the band's strong center, and the piece is content to stay in acoustic guitar mode the whole time. Despite its comparative innocuousness and blandness, the song is again about making a decisive choice, which figured prominently in the song \\"Sin\\".  Thus, there is a certain poignancy in the silence of the angels above once again, though whether or not this can spare the song from being programmed out is probably a matter of taste.<br /><br />\\"Why am I Here,\\" at 6'05\\", wastes no time dispelling the mood of the last song. And if there is one song on the album that shows why this supposedly Dream Theateresque band is not, this is it, if only because of the much more self-evident metal sensibility it exhibits, while still remaining melodic prog metal.  Off-hand, I'm not sure I could ever quite imagine myself headbanging at a Dream Theater concert. If I saw this song live, I would.<br /><br />\\"The Prophecy,\\" at 6'44\\", is the album's minor epic. Whether or not it succeeds may largely depend on how well you take the quasi-acoustic and \\"soulful\\" opening 2'30\\". Once it gets going, it kicks around ably enough, even as the chorus falls squarely into pure pop, and the return to the chorus after the bridge seems to be almost badly spliced.<br /><br />\\"The 1st Chapter,\\" at 19'07\\", is the album's official epic. It gets things going with a martial keyboard stomp, giant theatrical chords, and full orchestral pomp for exactly 2 minutes, followed by a second 2 minutes of high energy Nordic metal and keyboards leading up to the vocals, and another tale of a young man going astray.  While the structure at this point becomes a conventional verse-chorus, the chorus itself is very nicely crunchy. More Nordic metal then heralds the fall of our hero, but instead of spiraling into musical doom, it switches to grand, epic chords, as the hero realizes he is being chosen for a particular destiny. More martial crunching then, and the \\"keyboard no-no\\" another reviewer mentioned (bad patch choice). A piano-vocals section follows, as a prelude to the considerably extended sectional journey of hero's battle with darkness, ending on the expected big chord, that then lingers, and lingers as a cloudy, airy howl. Enter the calliope music (no really), pitched shifted and all to make it \\"creepy\\". The saving grace here is the still-lingering airy chord, that sonically does things to the otherwise inexplicable circus music (sure, sure, Circus Maximus).<br /><br />\\"Imperial Destruction,\\" at 6'30\\", dispels any possible kitsch from the end of the last song with one of the best riffs on the album, and then drops into another vast-sounding verse-chorus structure, including the usual keyboard and guitar break.  This far into the disc, so much of their usual good thing becomes almost wearing--something that definitely is (again) reminiscent of Everon.<br /><br />Supposedly, the keyboardist has left the band. I suspect this will prove to be a blessing on Circus Maximus' sophomore effort. In the first half of the disc, the keyboards are just fine, but they seem to run out of steam later on. Similarly, the basic intensity of the album is fairly unrelenting, again belying its metal roots.  As a debut, one can chalk this up to over enthusiasm, and the necessity of filling 70 minutes on a disc, but all told, it is hard not to be enthralled by this disc, if not always all the way through. By no means a perfect disc, nevertheless hopefully it is clear now that calling Circus Maximum a Dream Theater knock-off is beside the point.s not, this is it, if only because of the much more self-evident metal sensibility it exhibits, while still remaining melodic prog metal.

0743298020|3.0|This one came highly recommended so I was dissappointed that it wasn't more.  I sruggled to get to the end as well but anticipated great closure and kept going.  There were too many random possibilities that became the end of the story that didn't tie in at all.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|Ben said in his review that it was Hypocritical and blasphemous.  Being that he is not a christian I think he might have missed the reason that this film was such a success even though it was very bloody.  I bought this film when it came out on dvd several years ago and had my parents who are christians come to my house to watch it.  My mother had to leave half way thru the film.  My father and I finished watching it.  I made the comment to my mother that if Jesus had been able to go thru all that pain and suffering for me..yes for ME!, then I could at least sit thru this film and watch what he had to go thru.<br /><br />I have watched many \\"Jesus\\" films in my life, but none have truly made me stop and think of the horrible suffering and pain that the son of God had to actually go thru to pay for my sins and the sins of this world, until I watched \\"The Passion of the Christ\\". I think to view this film as the aforementioned reviewer did, with contempt and scorn, because it happened to be symptomatically in league with todays horror films of gore, is sad.  Only because he missed the whole point of the film and has yet to see what truly happened in these historical events.  Christians flocked to this film because they have now truly seen the pain that Christ went thru to save them from their sins and the wrath of God to come, which has been revealed to us in the book of revelations.
B000NA28A2|5.0|I guess I'll have to be the first English review.  Sorry about that.  I've been listening to Juan Luis Guerra y 4.40 since 1991 when I was introduced to [[ASIN:B000003MZU Bachata Rosa]].  I have all of their non-collection albums.   <br /> <br />I would have bought this album without hearing a track, they are just that good.  I immediately fell in love with a few of the songs (La Travesia, Qaue Me Des Tu Carino, La Llavae De Mi Corazon).  I like this album more each time I listen to it. <br /> <br />If you like their past albums, you will not be disappointed.
B000LC55F2|4.0|To explain precisely what I like about The Prestige would necessarily ruin the film for you, because it's the narrative structure that impresses me the most.  In many ways, the movie is about filmmaking, about telling a story, about suspending an audience's disbelief.  Because the story happens to be about magic and magicians, I watched the film more closely than I normally would.  I purposely distrusted everything, and so I saw the ending far before the credits rolled.  I still enjoyed the final reveal. <br /> <br />This is not to say that the film is overly obvious.  On the contrary, it's quite magnificent in its resistance to being a period piece.  It's clear that the director, Christopher Nolan, wanted to interpret the Victorian Age for a modern audience.  I think we tend to look at the nineteenth century as a dirty, repressive era that erupted into the War to End All Wars.  There's likely some truth to that, but there was also majesty of invention and vibrancy of ideas.  This is the era directly before television, and all of the science that would later be concentrated as entertainment was still in the raw, and it captivated and motivated many famous minds.  Scientists of the Victorian Age approached science with much greater rashness and risk of physical harm than scientists do today.  Political correctness, frivolous lawsuits, restrictive grant procedures, and a beaten down sense of adventure have all conspired to stifle much of the passion and magic of scientific discovery.  Interestingly enough, much of what most of us know as science comes to us in the form of entertainment, a la Mythbusters and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.  The Prestige reveals the birth of modern entertainment as the meeting of magic and science.  <br /> <br />The movie captures something else about the Victorian Age.  When you see a Victorian machine or tool, you see the labor and intellect that must have gone into its production.  When you look at your television or your dishwasher,there's nothing to see.  All of the humanity of invention is gone. <br /> <br />The Prestige is not a perfect film.  When it turns its final few tricks, and the story becomes clear, you might review the film in your head and question Christian Bale's performance.  It seems like Nolan was too afraid to let Bale give any clues for fear of giving everything away.  At first, I was annoyed with the choppy storytelling, because it seemed like a cheap way to create suspense.  In the end, I still think it was cheap, but it works because the film, as I mention above, is on some level about filmmaking and the production of entertainment. <br /> <br />My experience with the sound of the DVD was not favorable.  The dialogue is too quiet and muffled at times.  Nolan brings a lot of people (not only actors, but much of the crew) from Batman Begins, and the result is a movie that looks very similar.  David Bowie is a pleasant surprise as Tesla, one of the greatest scientists in history. <br /> <br />Memento remains Nolan's masterpiece, but The Prestige will satisfy a much larger crowd.  I feel like Nolan had one important thing to film, which he announces in Following and finishes in Memento.  His post-Memento films seem to me to require much more work on his part, because he's trying to satisfy his Memento fans as well as appeal to a general audience.  The Prestige accomplishes this dual task quite well.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|One of the great film music composers, Ennio Morricone, and one of the best cello players in the world, Yo-Yo Ma, have joined their refined forces to record this album. The power and the beauty of the music is mind-blowing and Yo-Yo Ma's performance is astonishing. There is a mixture of gentle and emotional tracks beside some high-energy numbers. Altogether, this is a remarkable musical & artistic feast for anyone who wants to recall some eminent movies while listening to this music, or just enjoy and explore the wide range of emotions. Either way, one is always inspired by this album.

0679746323|5.0|I realize that I am just one of over 200 people to review this book so I won't waste your time with a long review.  Mao: The Unknown Story is simply breathtaking in its scope and details.  I already knew more than a little about Chinese history when I first opened it.  Yet, I had no idea about the depths of Mao duplicity in every single aspect and facet of his life.  He was honest with no one.  He prized no one (except for his or her utility in his schemes).  He loved no one but himself.  Halliday and Chang not only expose Mao's murders, thefts, depredations of every kind, but fully explain how he successfully used terror on a massive scale, and how he easily manipulated the western press.  The details of how fellow traveler reporters were his willing or duped press whores are shocking.  Mao had an obsessive love of swimming pools and took pools away from the public.  He didn't properly bathe for 25 years - instead he was wet toweled clean every day by attendents.  He demanded his food be prepared in exacting ways that bordered on the bizarre.  All the while he was shooting people left and right for daring to own property.  He was the only millionaire allowed in China by the way. <br /> <br />I realize that the book is controversial.  It is controversial because some Maoist holdouts want to pretend Mao actually accomplished worthwhile things.  When one murders 60 million or more people - YOUR OWN PEOPLE - no matter what else you might accomplish, you're still a bloodsucking, murdering scumbag.  Yes, I know that many Chinese still think he is a hero.  Of course they do.  You can STILL go to prison in China for criticizing Mao in anything but the most general terms!  They should just count their lucky (red) stars that Mao is dead so he can't torture and kill them.
B0002B15XI|4.0|It's very hard to find this movie anywhere else. The copy we ordered worked perfectly well, and we got to enjoy a classic comedy.
B000NA28IE|3.0|I can understand that people dislike the Eragon movie because it plays like a super-fast-forwarded versionof the book which, much like the Harry Potter movies, leaves out essentiall plot bits and basically changes the whole story. I have read Eragon and I love it, but it is an unfilmable book. It simply has too much plot, thanks to Mr. Paolini's excellent writing skills. Like LOTR, it could be filmed only in the semi-distant future.     The main quibbles I have with the movie are (1) the abysmal screenplay: How on earth could someone change the plot of the book so much that it is barely recognizable? What could possibly be the motive? (2), the film's editing was off somehow. It was, in its condensed form, difficult to see where the plot had gone after that bit with Durza. Or was it the bit with Galbatorix? Anyway, the film just doesn't flow. (3), It feels too greedy, as if it was a quick-and-dirty play to leach a few bucks out of the wallets of Eragon-fans, and darn what epople think of it, they'll see it once.     There are two things, however, that cannot be faulted. (1) The acting is extremely good. Before I had seen the movie, I had read reviews that described Speelers' (Eragon's) performance with adjectives like \\"wooden.\\" This is a blatant lie. Speelers was almost faultless in what I believe is his first film performance. Although, given that critics have crucified this film, he may have doomed his career by starring in it. Jeremy Irons as Brom was also a delight to watch, and it made me truly sad when he was killed. (2), The special effects were almost surreally good. Saphira was possibly more realistic than the hallmark of digital, intelligent, movie creations: Smeagol from Lord of the Rings. All magic effects were likewise well dealt-with, and I found myself wishing the overall film was as good as the special effects forecasted.     In conclusion, I reccomend forming your own opinion about the movie, and ignore the bloodthirsty critics. Perhaps the second film will shine as the first did not. Give it a watch, and decide then whether it is worth buying.     P.S. The special edition is worth the extra money. The deleted scenes and storyboards help you see what this film might have been.    P.P.S. To the people who didn't find my review helpful: did you say that because you don't agree with me, which would be an improper use of the voting buttons, or because it was a bad review? Think about it. Also, please comment, whether you agree with me or not.
B00007AJF9|1.0|Part music video, part historical epic?  Some of the film's shots were inexplicable: circling ministers shot from above--why???  Straightforward shot?  make up your mind!  Choppy and ineffectual.  I had heard good things about the film, but I must go back and examine the heads of my informants,  Someone here wrote Blanchett was pale and ethereal.  That's nice--but not enough to tackle an iconic ruler such as Elizabeth I.  Give me Glenda Jackson or Helen Mirren . . .even Bette Davis for crike's sakes--at least they have the CHOPS to tackle a great role. I was bored and irritated by this film which didn't seem to tell a great historic bio as much as it used the film to allow Blanchett several costume changes and some wacko camera-person to occassionally film from MTV-ish angles (for no consistent or apparent reason). To borrow from Snow White's two dwarves: Dopey and crappy . . .
B000007492|5.0|I bought this for other songs, but \\"Crime of the Century\\" was the surprise for me. I missed some of this music, being slightly before my time, and was mostly familiar with \\"The Logical Song\\". \\"Give A Little Bit\\" has always been a favorite of mine as well. It's a good collection, and I'm sorry I missed the experience the first time around!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is an excellent Bond movie!  In fact, it is a great movie up to and including the casino scenes.  However, the non-actors decide to go for special effects and a disconnected story line in a poor attempt to justify Bond, James Bond's misogynistic ways.  Some will really like the timely torture scenes (e.g. Abu Ghraib) and the tragic double-cross at the end.  However, I just found it to be inconsistent.  Bond can't \\"tell\\" what Eva Green is going to do.  Here is a hint James... That uncontrollable crying is trying to tell you something.  Also, what is with the half-man half-honed lizard bad guy? My Dad always said never play pool with someone named after a city, I will add don't play poker with someone who squirts blood from his eye. <br /> <br />The acting in the movie is excellent!  I enjoyed most of the characters.  The violence is way too much for PG-13 movie.  Also, the sequence of the whole movie is a little awkward.  Bond gets his \\"00\\" promotion but still seems to be in or need training. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the movie up to the casino scenes.  In fact, I'd recommend turning it off there. <br />
B000GFLE86|5.0|I enjoyed MP's previous album, and picked this one up based upon that success. I was not disappointed. It's a great jazz vocal effort, one of my favorites of the year so far. It's definitely an album, and not a collection of songs, to me.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|After many weeks of listening to this new album from Machine Head, I find the Blackening to be the most complete, complex, and exciting metal release that I have listened to in a very long time.<br /><br />There is definitely a new layer of sound present on this album that is missing from previous Machine Head releases.  The Blackening has a presence that indicates that Machine Head truly pushed themselves to create aggressive, technically pleasing music that crushes as well as intrigues.  The solos and riffs fit perfectly within each song and are both technical, and heavy.  The melodic moments are moody and help to add depth and diversity to this mostly metal album.  As for the lyrics, Rob Flynn tackles social, religious, political, and personal issues throughout the eight tracks on the Blackening.  It is very refreshing to hear a band that is not pleased with what is happening in our world these days.  I suppose the only weakness this album has is in association with the at times cheesy singing.  Halo is a great example of this.  An amazingly technical song with occasional annoying vocals.  I personally believe this album would have been much better with a more straight forward, aggressive vocal style.  At times, the vocals simply do not work well at all.<br /><br />I will end my review here by saying that Machine Head have done the impossible.  After their release of Supercharger, I thought a miracle would have to occur in order to get the band back on their feet.  That miracle came in the form of Mr. Phil Demmel (Machine Head's newest lead guitarist).  Everything that worked so well on Through The Ashes of Empires is improved upon with the Blackening.  Songs on Through the Ashes that sounded technical and complex pale in comparison to everything on the Blackening.  The most intense moments of Burn My Eyes as well as the More Things Change are matched riff for gigantic riff on the Blackening.  Also, at times, Machine Head approach a very progressive sound with the Blackening as well.  I feel as if Clenching The Fists Of Dissent is the most progressive and exciting metal I have heard in a very long time.<br /><br />Machine Head is a band that is loved by many, and scrutinized by many more.  With a few strange album releases in the past, I understand why so many have lost respect for Machine Head over the years.  I personally fell in love with this band when they released Burn My Eyes and The More Things Change in the early 90's.  For years, many have compared anything released by this band to those two albums, for good reason.  I feel as if the Blackening is an improvement on anything Machine Head have released in the past.  This band pushed their talents as far as possible, and the results are surprising and exciting.<br /><br />If you are new to Machine Head, start with Burn My Eyes.  That album is a great example of Machine Head's core sound.  The Blackening takes the Machine Head formula from Burn My Eyes, and adds depth, variety and complexity.  I'm excited to see if Machine Head can release a future album that matches or even improves upon the Blackening.well.

B000002UAR|5.0|This is one of the Fab 4's first truly spectacular efforts. \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is one of those songs that has stuck with me, all my life. I can't imagine that there were a lot of pop songs at the time that really explored the themes of hopelessness in life, the way that the lyrics did here. \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\" are also long-time faves. Definitely worth the listen.
B00006JDVV|3.0|My fifteen-year-old son had me watch this DVD with him and we ended up having a lot of fun with it. Once I got over the cornball acting and lame plot, I realized that I was essentially watching an English filmic answer to \\"Godzilla\\".No less crude in terms of acting, script and plausibility than that now classic Japanese monster movie, watching Reign of Fire is like watching an equation of the 1941 Blitz (which my parents lived through) with the Arthurian legends of old. In the same way that Godzilla mirrors the horrors and devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so too does Reign of Fire mirror the German firebombing of London, Coventry and Liverpool during the Blitz. Godzilla was an attempt by the filmmakers to make sense of the nuclear bombs in mythological terms, using their own ancient dragon legends. I suspect that the makers of Reign of Fire have attempted the same, or at the very least, given a nod to the Godzilla tradition - the height of B-moviedom. This is a well-known aspect of the Godzilla film, and it cannot have escaped the notice of the makers of Reign of Fire that there was potential for the same in this movie. Recently a great deal of attention has been paid to those with memories of the Blitz and collection of eye-witness accounts is currently taking place in the U.K. <br /> <br />If you watch this film with the same attitude with which you might watch Godzilla, you might be entertained on that level and this might manage to carry you over the other very obvious shortcomings of this film. Especially if you have teenage children in the house who are into fantasy story lines and are not too picky about the versimilitude of what they are watching. It might even open a discussion about film history, war, and the background of all creative efforts, even less sophisticated examples.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is a collection of mostly traditional Christmas holiday songs. Sarah's voice continues to be one of my favorites, and this was a perfect album for the holiday season.
0618680004|5.0|Let me begin by saying that this book is an extremely good read. It is written by the now uber famous biologist Richard Dawkins, writer of the best-sellers `The Selfish Gene' and `The Blind Watchmaker'. What I will say though, is this: Don't read it thinking it is the definitive volume on Atheism, that it will answer all your questions. Think of it as a fantastic Atheism 101.<br /><br />Dawkins' main justification for the book is that religion has the potential to be very, very dangerous. This is mainly because religion confers virtue on people who believe without evidence. This in itself is o.k. for the majority, but has the potential to cause great harm, since someone who believes without evidence can be compelled to do a great many irrational things given the right environment e.g. become a suicide bomber.<br /><br />He also gives the very interesting insight that religion is a virus of the mind (a meme) and that it has probably come about due to an offshoot of something else, something that probably has some value in natural selection. He guesses the pervasiveness of religion comes from the valuable quality of being naïve and gullible as a child and therefore believing everything your parents say e.g. a child that believes its parents when they say that if they keep on walking they will fall off a cliff and die, has a higher chance of survival than a child that doesn't believe his/her parents. This however, leaves us open to believing nonsensical things our parents say, like 'god exists'.<br /><br />Another example of Dawkins' points is that that children should not be labelled as having a religious denomination, claiming that it is similar to calling a child a `Marxist child.'<br /><br />Some of the book's detractors claim that it doesn't delve enough into the scriptures, I myself don't believe it delves enough into concept of human nature, but that's not the point of the book. This is a book written primarily to raise consciousness about atheism, and to lay out the broad ill-effects of religion on humanity. In my opinion, Dawkins doesn't need to waste time analysing all the scriptures to get his point across ' that Christians and Jews cherry pick the `nice' passages and stories from the Bible. He doesn't need to because it become quite clear that the criteria upon which they cherry pick is something that both religious and non-religious people possess. Therefore, to say that we get our morals and values from religion is simply wrong.<br /><br />This book is not written with the same eloquence of The Selfish Gene or the comprehensive analysis of the Blind Watchmaker, rather, it broadly tackles the overwhelming topic of religion, specifically Christianity and Islam. It is written primarily for the American audience, which means (and I don't mean this arrogantly) that some detail probably had to be forgone in favour of more punchy prose.<br /><br /> This is a tome that should interest any thinking person and propel them into more in-depth study. Books I further recommend to enhance understanding on the topics of evolution and `god' are Dawkins' \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" and Karen Armstrong's very in-depth (but perhaps not user-friendly) \\"The History of God\\" respectively.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0393315703 The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345384563 A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam]]ism, and to lay out the broad ill-effects of religion on humanity.

B000MNP2KI|2.0|I've just finished watching this movie, and I rate this 2 out of 5 stars.  This has got to be one of the worst James Bond movies that I've seen.  The script for this movie was absolutely way off from the James Bond movies that we've been accustomed to.  What happened to the exciting beginning, the fascinating gadgets, and the unique cars usually associated with Bond movies?  The writers, producer, and director made this James Bond seemed less experienced than the previous James Bonds - more trusting and just a little bit gullible.  What happened to the self assured and confident James Bond?  The writers, producer, and director all need to go back and review the old James Bond movies.  Perhaps after they've reviewed them, they can come up with a winner next time.  The only good things going for this movie are the actors and the beautiful settings where some of the scenes were filmed.
B00005ASHM|3.0|If enough people call a pretty good album a masterpiece, is it really a masterpiece?  For some reason, a lot of musicians rave about Pet Sounds.  I guess it's an acquired taste.  I've listened to it 100 times and apparently I'm missing something.  Maybe it was so different from anything else that had been released at the time, a so-called concept album, that it caught everyone by surprise.  It must be the unusual production values.  Who knows?  For some reason, Paul McCartney was blown away by the album.  Maybe it was all the acid that the Fab 4 was dropping at the time.  This is a great album like Revolution #9 is a great song.  For all you reviewers jumping on the bandwagon w/ this one, baaa baaa.  That's the sound a sheep makes.  Great albums:  Revolver, Dark Side of the Moon, Highway 61 Revisited, Born to Run, What's Going On (Marvin), Nevermind.
B000NA28I4|1.0|This was a very disappointing movie! If you are a fan of the book you will hate the movie.  <br />  <br />They left so much important information and changed so much else. Rohan is not leaving just to leave. Sphira did not name herself. Where was the dwarf that meat Eragon at the door of the Varden and road off with him and so much else.  <br />  <br />Although I read the book my husband was completely lost and asked a ton of questions. <br />This was like watching Lord of the rings and not telling you about Bilbo's impute or the back ground on the ring you would of been lost.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is my favorite Pink Floyd piece of work. It is full of individual performances by each of the band members layered in almost every song. <br />Put on your headphones, pick an instrument and listen to what each individual band member is contributing to every song. There was(and never has been) a band that would or could perform a record like this. <br />To me, every song on this album is perfect. <br />Sit back,close your eyes and enjoy!!
B000MG1ZGA|4.0|Pros: <br /> <br />The sound is absoultly phenominal.  This should be an example of what the standard should be in re-releasing material.  It honestly sounds as if you are in the studio with the band.  Side by side with the original issue of the cd this blows the older version away.  Everything is so crisp and clear.  This should be expected with technological advances. <br /> <br />The price.  If you're looking to update the original cds without all the fancy packaging it's cheaper to by these new issues rather than the latest boxed set. <br /> <br />I'm a purist at heart and don't think albums should be remixed but I'm indifferent here.  The one thing that I didn't expect was the additional lyrics during \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\". Knowing the song the way it was originally released, it threw me for a loop when I first heard it and was totally unexpected.   <br /> <br />Cons: <br /> <br />None.  Hands down this is my favorite Doors album.  Next in line is to upgrade my Morrison Hotel cd (the 2nd best in my opinion).
B000LW9PY4|5.0|I can now reflct upon the unfolding of Young Americans in 5.1. <br /> <br />I must say it's not the same experience as the hearing the 5.1 mixes of Talking Heads material, since Young Americans wasn't recorded as expensively - and doesn't have as many overdubs as much of the Heads works. In other words, don't expect a total revelation here. <br /> <br />On the other hand, there are new things to be found, especially when you get to side two and such tracks as Across the Universe and Somebody Up There Likes me. Putting the backing vocalists into the rear is a master stroke. Sitting the center of my setup is like sitting in the room while the album was recorded, surrounded by Bowie in front, and the singers behind.  <br /> <br />Some of the new seperation does allow you to fully realize the depth to some of the songs - the use of handdrums on Young Americans is a stand out, and you can really enjoy them now like never before. <br /> <br />The DVD also includes a show Bowie did at the time with Dick Cavert. Dick was a bit, erm, straight for Bowie, but it's interesting none-the-less. You get to hear Bowie do two tracks (annoyingly the note say he did three, but they didn't inlcude the third). He starts with 1984, and ends with Young Americans. 1984 is simply superb, and it's fascinating to hear such a song played in a mainstream show. Young Americans wasn't fully gelled yet, so it has slightly different lyrics, which is always fun. <br /> <br />Bowie was at the height of White Soul image, and he's clearly thin and well on his way to next persona - the Thin White Duke. Sadly, it's also clear he'd been snorting some chemicals before the show was aired. All the usual signs - fidgetting, jerky movements, lack of concentration, and a perpetual sniff, are evident. Despite that the longish (20 minutes or so) interview is interesting in that Cavert keeps trying to paint Bowie as an elite artist with fantastical ideas, while Bowie keeps his feet well on the ground and is quite dismissive of airs and graces. It's a good watch. <br /> <br />Now for the negatives. As with the Talking Heads 5.1 mixes, in all honesty they can be a bit hit and miss. Sometimes a certain song just... well falls apart. It loses its balance, its drive, and sounds like something deflated, and/or, completely different. With Young Americans it's Fascination that just, well, goes to pieces. Perhaps I wil come to terms with the new mix, but first time around it sounded fractured and messy, as though the4 band are no longer playing together. The familiar melody has been lost as the indivudal sounds of the band playing go in seemingly different directions. It's the only true mistep here, and I'm not sure what to make of it. The rest sound great. <br /> <br />The worse thing though, the heinous thing, is EMI's assinine decision to make the default playback on the DVD a PCM Stereo mix! Wtf?!?!?  <br /> <br />Let me explain - the disc ships with two discs - one a CD including the new stereo mix, the other a DVD with the 5.1 mix. You get three mixes on the DVD, PCM Stereo, 5.1 Dolby, and 5.1 DTS. With the Talking Heads discs (packaged the same way), you could put the DVD in the player, and simply press PLAY. What you get is the 5.1 mix. This makes perfect sense, because if you wanted the damn stereo mix, you'd put in the CD, surely?!? <br /> <br />With Young Americans you get the stereo mix from the DVD by default. To switch to the DTS track, you have to circumvent the menus. Which is crap, because the player I use for DTS is hooked up to my projector, and I'm not going to start that up just so I can listen to Young Americans!  <br /> <br />And no - the damn AUDIO button does not change tracks on the fly. What a poor decision! Yes, you have to simply learn the remote sequence to get what you want: UP - SELECT - UP- UP - SELECT - PLAY. But really, it's completely stupid and I don't know what they were thinking. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a very good release of the classicalbum, and is definately worth picking up. It has a couple of annoyances, but I can live with those. They've slowly been given the ultra-deluxe treatments to classic Bowie (ziggy, Aladin Sane, Diamond Dogs, and now this), so I suppose Station to Station is next. I hope so. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Bowie and this album, this is a no brainer.
B000KQGP2G|5.0|for me, everything that daniel gildenlow touches turns to gold and this is no exception...once again, POS has released a jewel in music...progressive, metal, technical,whatever...it's music on its top form...just buy it!
B000BAQ8A0|4.0|Anything with Florez is great because of him, but his performances are better if the staging is superb and the rest of the cast too. Madrid falls down in these categories. His performance at the Met recently with DiDonato was better overall and the staging much better. It is a pity that Decca will not bring out his best performances. See my comments re his Daughter of the Regiment.
B000002I6X|4.0|While not his best effort, this is still a good album.  It was a top 10 hit in the US and was certified GOLD.  It produced two singles that just missed the Billboard Top 40, Change Partners (which peaked at 43) and Marianne (which hit 42).  Stills departs from his accoustic folk-rock roots for a remake of his Buffalo Springfield classic Bluebird, which he probably would have been better off to leave off the album.  He seems to try to redo it with a big band sound and it just does not work.  But there is more than enough good material on the album to make-up for that miss.
B00003XAVA|5.0|This is my favorite Crosby - Nash album.  It came three years and several solo projects after their first release and was a big hit in 1975 (reaching number 6 on the Billboard album chart in the US and being certified GOLD).  Many of the songs on this album was intended for an aborted CSNY reunion.  It produced one minor hit single \\"Carry Me\\" but many other songs received airplay on FM stations that played album cuts including: Bittersweet, Take The Money And Run, Love Work Out, and the classic To The Last Whale.  A very strong effort!
B00000C3G6|4.0|After the initial demise of CSNY, David Crosby and Graham Nash decided to continue working together.  This was their first album together and one of their best.  It was a big hit in the US (reaching number 4 on the Billboard album chart and being certified GOLD) and produced their only top 40 hit \\"Immigration Man\\" and the minor follow-up hit \\"Southbound Train\\".  This was a strong album and provided a needed \\"fix\\" for fans who wished that CSNY had continued.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is probably one of the best movies ever produced by Pixar and Walt Disney.  It was a hit at the theaters, and also a hit on the DVD release.  This two-disc set features the same movie as the original theatrical release, plus lots of extra features.  There are extra scenes and deleted scenes, but these are mainly sketches and hence are not included as part of the regular movie.  The movie itself is worth buying this set; its bright and flashy with cool visuals and special effects that make it attractive for kids.  The soundtrack is considerably different from the traditional classical fair found in Disney's motion length pictures.  This movie's soundtrack is laid back and different, but paces well with the action.  The voice-overs are great, and the comedy is unique and hilarious.  Vegetarian sharks!  Fish without memory!  Disney takes family entertainment to new heights with this great movie, and I highly recommend it.
033041836X|4.0|This book was a good read. There were moments when it was incredibly intense, but other moments were you feel like you are wading through the words. I was crying into the first few pages, but I thought I was in for a lack-luster ending when I reached the last chapter of book. Sebold pulled through that though. The ending was not as it first appeared to be headed, but wasn't quite up to the level of the rest of the book. <br /> <br />However, I applaud her for writing this memoir. I could see it helping a number of people. We all have our own stories, and these stories do mold us through out our lives. I know this all too well. It's encouraging that she was able to turn such a negative experience into a driving force and not allow it to diminish who she is.
B00005JSGK|4.0|Hatari means danger in Swahili. And so it is. A group of animal-catchers, operating from fast-moving trucks, capture wild animals using rope (no tranquilizers!). The animals frequently attack the trucks, for which the trucks are protected with old tires mounted on their sides. Attempts to corral a rhino lead to one of the men being severely gored. A tourniquet does not stem the loss of blood, and the man is near death. In the end, it takes a blood transfusion to save the man's life, followed by days of recovery.<br /><br />There are scenes showing the capture of giraffes, wildebeest, and other animals. Natives help in the roundup of escaped ostriches. A woman raises one, two, and then three unweaned baby elephants. These are fed goats' milk, which turns out to be not so simple to get from the goats! In time, the woman leaves the group unannounced, and attempts to return to Europe. Her baby elephants sniff her out when she doesn't want to be found, enabling the others to locate her.<br /><br />Throughout this flick, John Wayne is his typical self.  He engages in blustery talk to others, including women. Diplomacy is not exactly his forte--but then who would expect the Duke to be diplomatic? And, as one would expect in a western, there are fistfights.<br /><br />There are funny scenes in the film as well, as when a man builds rockets to be fired in order to scare monkeys into going up a tree. In the end, ironically, he is the most scared of all when one of his rockets is launched. He cannot even bear to look at it from a distance!
B000NA77YO|5.0|Black Sabbath: The Dio Years is my favorite era of Sabbath. Sure, the Ozzy era is classic and is what started it all, but Ronnie James Dio's talent as a singer/songwriter is far greater in my opinion. This greatest hits package gives us 16 songs and is overall a near flawless compilation. Of course, as in all compilations, not everything could be included and some gems were left out. All three Dio-era albums are well covered and almost all the classics are here.<br /><br />The biggest omission is certainly The Sign of the Southern Cross from The Mob Rules. Due to the song's length, at nearly eight minutes, it's understandable why they would choose to leave it out in favor of putting an extra song on there. The only song I'm not too happy to have on this disc is Lonely Is the Word. The Heaven and Hell album was already well represented with 6 out of its 8 songs; it's just not that memorable of a song as say Time Machine from Dehumanizer (a pretty good, often overlooked album) and could have been left out in order to give us the afore-mentioned 1992 gem. I was worried about the decision to include a live version of Children of the Sea, one of Sabbath's best songs ever, but the live version sounds crisp and Dio's vocals soar; it's just as good if not better than the studio version. I still would've gone for a Dio rendition of an Ozzy song if I were going to include something from Live Evil; a track like Iron Man or Children of the Grave. Last but not least, the three new songs aren't the best the band has written, but deserve their place here nonetheless. The Devil Cried is an acquired taste; give it a few spins, you'll see, it's a cool song that fits well with the other Sabbath songs on this disc. Shadow of the Wind is good, but the weakest of the three, in my humble opinion. The best one has to be Ear in the Wall; an energetic and catchy tune.<br /><br />The final verdict is if you only have one of the Dio-era Sabbath albums or none at all, this album is perfect for you. The songs have been remastered and the sound quality is crisp and remarkable; another reason to update your catalog of Sabbath CDs with this disc. I saw Sabbath with Dio two weeks ago in Montreal, Canada when they stopped here for their tour (along with Down and Megadeth) and it was an evening I won't soon forget; the set list was awesome and the show was one of the best I'd seen in years. I'm hoping the boys will enjoy working together again enough to decide to release a new full-length album in the near future.ave been remastered and the sound quality is crisp and remarkable; another reason to update your catalog of Sabbath CDs with this disc.

B000002LLC|3.0|Madonna's 1990 album \\"I'm Breathless\\" is often considered her worst (for good and bad reasons), but there are a few gems on here. For example, \\"Now I'm Following You (Part 2)\\", which is a dancified version of the previous track. It's more than a little weird and VERY dated-sounding, but I like it. Other notable songs are \\"Hanky Panky\\", a somewhat bizarre song about spanking, and the obvious choice, \\"Vogue\\". However, the rest of the songs range from okay to just plain horrendous, particularly \\"I'm Going Bananas\\", in which Madonna sings in a high, nasal, Betty Boop-esque tone which is just painful to listen to.<br /><br />My advice is to buy this only if you are a Maddy completist; if not, skip it.
B00005NC66|5.0|I finally did it. I finished watching \\"&Agrave; bout de souffle\\" aka \\"Breathless\\". I kept putting it off because I usually have problem when everybody tells me that such and such film is the epitome of its era or it breaks all the rules, starts the revolution, and reinvents the cinema. Well, \\"&Agrave; bout de souffle\\" does not put you under the pressure, it takes you for a ride, and you follow for 90 minutes its incredibly young characters, common crook (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his American free-spirited girlfriend (Jean Seberg) on their journey on the streets of 1960-th Paris along with Raoul Coutard's legendary camera. I am not going to tell here how great the camera work was, how fantastic the music score and the views of Paris were - the fans of the film know that already. They also know about the beginning of French New Wave, and how it influenced the future cinema. I just want to say that the movie was made over forty years ago - the smoking was cool back then, and Belmondo made smoking look very sexy. Belmondo fascinates me in this film. I've seen him in a lot of later movies - he's always been good (I recommend Le Magnifique, 1973 and Le Professionnel,1981 ) - but in &Agrave; bout de souffle he is not just good - he is embodiment of cool, his face changes its expression every moment, you can not take your eyes off him. Is it me or he does remind the very young Mick Jagger - not commonly handsome but irresistible and sexy? He and young (she was 21 at the time) Jean Seaborg made one of the best screen couples ever. My favorite scenes:<br /><br />Michel drives the stolen car in the beginning of the film, and he starts to talk to us, the audience. The day is nice, the sun is shining, and the life is beautiful...<br /><br />Michel and Patricia drive in the convertible. The wind plays with her short hair. We only see the back of her head and her neck. Michel tells her that he loves the girl with a beautiful neck, wrists, knees, but she is a chicken...<br /><br />Patricia comes to the hotel to find Michel in her bed. They start talking about nothing and about very serious things. They smoke, she tries to find a good place for her new poster, and he wants to sleep with her. In the end of the scene, his face, he looks at her - there is love in that look...<br /><br />There is more - I am sure everyone who saw it has his/her favorite scenes.ricia comes to the hotel to find Michel in her bed.

B000JIHP88|5.0|My little girl has had this mobile in her crib since she was a couple weeks old and she has always loved it. She used to just watch the animals move around and fall asleep to the soothing music. Now she will turn her head to watch the base when it lights up. This was a great buy for us. My only complaint would be the little remote that comes with it. The clicker is very loud... which, if you are using the remote, it's because you are trying to turn the mobile on without being seen and the loud click gets my girl's attention every time. We just don't use the clicker anymore but the fact remains that she loves the mobile itself. She'll be bummed when we have to take it down!
B00000IREA|4.0|Jane Fonda stars in a title role of this famous cult sci-fi sex comedy as a space beauty in the variety of skimpy outfits. She looks great - all male (and female) creatures on a strange planet SoGo (Sodom and Gomorra?) drooled over her.<br /><br />\\"Barbarella\\" (1968) directed by then Fonda's husband, Roger Vadim may be the silliest, the cheesiest, the campiest movie ever made but it is certainly one of the most entertaining comedies I've seen and is Fun with the capital \\"F\\". It is also very \\"pretty - pretty\\".<br /><br />So, what do we have here? In the year 40.000, Barbarella \\"the Queen of the Galaxy\\" is sent by the President of Earth in search of the disappeared scientist named Durand Durand (finally I learned how the band got its name.) While looking for him, her space ship crashes on the planet Sogo where she encounters Pygar the Blind Angel (yes the man with the wings), Professor Ping - kind scientist (the celebrated and the finest mime artist Marcel Marceau in the rare speaking role), Dildano (David Hemmings of \\"Blowup\\") - the revolutionary who plots to overthrow the evil empire, Marcan - the barbarian who introduces Barbarella to an old fashioned love making (the advanced one is achieved by taking a pill and holding hands - welcome to the brave new world!) and The Great Tyrant - dangerous and very attractive ruler of Sogo (Anita Pallenberg, the object of Mick's, Brian's and Keith's desire and Mrs. Keith Richard at the time) who calls Barbarella \\"pretty-pretty\\" and invites her to come and play.<br /><br />Fonda is quite good as a naive Barbarella and sometimes there is such an ironic and intelligent smile on her face that it should not surprise you what a fine actress she would eventually become.
1400079179|3.0|I HATE the way this book jumps from sceen to sceen every two or three pages. It really breaks up the continuity of the narrative. I am sick and tired of reading books that were obviously written as a screen play.<br /><br />I wish the autor had just picked a point of view and stuck with it. I found the book very tough going. Every time I would become involved in the story he would kill my interest by jumping to a different character's point of view.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|This movie requires a heaping helping of \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\".  The plot is way out there, but the intelligent script, seamless directing and strong acting make it work.  This film promises to be a pleasant surprise to you.<br /><br />IRS Agent Harold Crick begins hearing a female voice in his head.  He comes to realize that this voice is narrating his life, in all of its tedium.  One day, the narrative takes a disturbing turn as Crick learns that he is to die.  Crick seeks the help of a psychiatrist, who advises him that he is schizophrenic and in need of medication.  Crick doesn't accept this, and the psychiatrist suggests that he enlist the help of a literature professor, since the narrative in his head sounds like a novel being written.  Crick turns to Professor Jules Hilbert, and together they try to determine who is narrating Crick's life.  As it turns out, the narrative in his head is a novel being written by a famous writer, Karen Eiffel.<br /><br />Subplots add interest and dimension to this film.  Karen Eiffel appears to be quite insane, and her publisher sends an assistant (Penny Escher) to help her finish the book.  Along his journey, Crick meets a quirky bakery owner named Ana Pascal.  Ana becomes the love interest in the film.<br /><br />Exceptional supporting performances help make this movie special.  First is the gifted actress Emma Thompson as novelist Karen Eiffel.  She found just the right level for this character: off balance enough to make the character interesting, yet not over the top.  Ms. Thompson is nicely balanced by Queen Latifah as Penny Escher.  Latifah just gets better and better.  Dustin Hoffman lends his considerable talent as Professor Jules Hilbert.  His performance is understated; showing enough clinical detachment to be a credible academic, but enough compassion for Harold to make him likeable.<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal is Ana Pascal, a role she appears born to play.  She was incredibly cute and fiery.  The script may have made her a bit cliche.  Ana is a former Harvard Law student who discovered a talent for baking, and thus devoted her life to bringing joy to others via baked goods.  Nonetheless, Gyllenhaal found the soul of the character, and gave an honest and engaging performance.  Ana hated Crick initially, after all, he is an IRS Agent who is auditing her.  In the end though, she sees the lonely man within Harold Crick, and her empathetic and nurturing personality take over.  It is through Ana that Harold finally finds happiness and release, starting with his first homemade cookies.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is just brilliant in this film.  I was a Will Ferrell fan long ago when I saw him join with the magnificent Cheri O'Teri in their \\"Cheerleader\\" sketches on Saturday Night Live.  Since then, he has shown that he has serious talent.  This role may have funny moments, but it is a dramatic role.  This character has an arc with a capital \\"A\\", and Ferrell hits all the right notes.  There are many wonderful scenes with Ferrell, but I have two favorites.  First is the scene where he tears his apartment up looking for the \\"voice\\".  People in the theatre laughed, but it was probably from discomfort.  Here was a desparate man afraid that he is going insane.  I loved the long scene he had with Gyllenhaal where they fell in love.  To attempt to seduce a girl was a big step for Harold.  His nerves and sweetness were charming.  That night, Harold Crick became a full man.  Ferrell and Gyllenhaal were unbeatable scene partners.<br /><br />This is a creative, intelligent film with comedy, drama, and a lot of heart.  It features a stellar cast on top of their games.<br /><br />Highly recommended.he script may have made her a bit cliche.

0151013047|5.0|This is probably the only novel of its kind, a novel with no lyrical descriptions of people and places. It has no dialogue at all; in fact, the entire novel is a long, gripping monologue.<br /><br />A novel in the form of a monologue and without a dialogue is a brilliant and novel idea, and it works magnificently in this case only because Mohsin Hamid is a superb writer with formidable prowess. He grips the reader's mind with polished and haunting prose.<br /><br />The hero of the novel, Changez, a student from Lahore, Pakistan, attends Princeton University. After graduation at the top in his class, he secures an excellent and well-paying job at the elite valuation firm Underwood Samson. He becomes well-adjusted and well-accustomed to the American way of life, falls in love with the beautiful and elegant, Princeton-educated Erica, who hails from an aristocratic family. For the first time in his life Changez is happy. Then, unexpectedly, on September 11, 2001, two planes crash into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in Manhattan. As a result, the towers collapse. And along with the towers, Changez's personal world also collapses. When the terrorists are identified as Muslims from Saudi Arabia, and people, anchormen, and the media speculate about the reasons for the attack, Changez finds himself questioning the injustices perpetrated by America abroad. His priorities in life change, and he neglects his job. And as a result he loses his job. He returns to Lahore, where at a market in the district of Old Anarkali, he meets an American stranger. The novel is narrated as a monologue addressed to this stranger.<br /><br />Read what Changez says to the stranger about Princeton University: \\"Every fall, Princeton raised her skirt for the corporate recruiters who came onto campus and-as you say in America-showed them some skin. The skin Princeton showed was good skin, of course-young, eloquent, and clever as can be-but even among all that skin, I knew in my senior year that I was something special. I was a perfect breast, if you will-tan, succulent, seemingly defiant of gravity-and I was confident of getting any job I wanted.\\"<br /><br />A few readers have felt that the ending of the novel, though stunning, was all too sudden. But the author has explained in interviews that the ending was intentional. \\"It was always intended to end as it does. For me, the reader is a character in a novel, and the way one reads it shapes the outcome. So a reader who is more suspicious of Pakistanis might read it differently from one who is more suspicious of Americans. But it is the fear we are all being fed, the sense that something menacing lurks in the shadows of our world, that has the potential to make the novel a thriller,\\" he has said.<br /><br />Because the events in the novel occur in the shadow of the fall of the Twin Towers, and the novel is written from the perspective of a typical Muslim's mind, and a Muslim from Pakistan, the book has generated a minor storm of controversy. But most of the professional reviewers, and major magazines such as Time, and newspapers such as the NYT, The Guardian, and even the Publishers Weekly and the acerbic Kirkus Review, to name a few, have been fair and kind to the author, and all have written glowing reviews.<br /><br />I found the novel riveting. Using words smooth as pebbles in a riverbed, the author has produced a novel with a thousand sharp edges. The wounds inflicted by the incidents on September 11, 2001, on Americans' minds, have not yet healed. The author has touched the living scabs of the wounds, rekindling the pain. This novel will make you think about our prejudices and preconceived ideas and it will prompt you to look deep within yourself also, and to ponder about our world which has changed so drastically, almost overnight. It's a masterful feat befitting a great writer. A graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School, Mohsin Hamid is an impressive master of English prose.<br /><br />Reading this novel will leave you spell bound, and it will also literally take your breath away.ish prose. <br />Reading this novel will leave you spell bound, and it will also literally take your breath away.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

0345440900|1.0|If attachment parenting feels right for you, skip this book. Hogg claims to be a moderate, but clearly she sits well in the camp of those who believe that a baby (even a newborn) can be \\"spoiled\\" by paying too much attention to it. She stops short of the \\"cry it out\\" method, but there's only shades of difference between allowing a baby to cry it out and Hogg's notion that parents should avoid holding the baby for too long, rocking the baby to sleep, doting over the baby, etc in order to \\"foster independence.\\" Independence? In a newborn!?   <br /> <br />On the plus side, there is some merit in the E.A.S.Y. System (that being the baby should Eat, have some Activity, and then ideally take nap). Also, the concept of treating the baby with the respect that you would any full-grown person is difficult to find fault with.  <br /> <br />If you're going to read this book, you'd do well to read Dr. Sears to get an alternate perspective on a baby's needs and wants. <br />
0066620996|5.0|This is an excellent book and also it is a great option for everybody to read and understand the different between good and great companies and how a mediocre company can be transformed to a great company. Years ago, Jim Collins asked the question, \\"Can a good company become a great company and if so, how?\\" He concludes that it is possible, but not easy to do the transformation. At the beginning of the book appears this statement \\"Good is the enemy of Great\\" I totally agree with that, this book is intended to understand how a good company can be an excellent company. Collins and his team explore what goes into a company's transformation from mediocre to excellent. Based on empirical evidence and volumes of data, the team uncovers timeless principles on how the Good to Great companies produced sustained great results and achieved enduring greatness, evolving into companies that were indeed Built to Last. <br />Collins and his team of researchers began their research by electing 1,435 companies, looking for companies that made great improvements in their performance. Finally, they elected only 11 great companies and they found that those have common patterns to be success. He and his research team interviewed most of the good to great executives.  This book analyzes the practices that 11 companies made transition from good to excellent performance. Collins focused his research in very well-known companies, this issue makes the book interesting and the fact that technology did not in itself generate corporate transformation; and the scant attention that these upward-trending companies paid to such issues as managing change or motivating people. This book shows a new concept to me \\"Level 5 Leadership\\"; the term level 5 refers to the highest level in hierarchy of executive capabilities. It is surprised that a type of leadership is required for turning a good company into a great one. The good to great leaders are self-effacing, quiet, reserved, and even shy. The level five builds enduring greatness through a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional. This concept is empirical and not an ideological one. This equations summarize the level five leadership personality (Humility +will= Level five)  <br /> <br />

B000NVIGC0|2.0|If there's one thing that I truly appreciate about Wilco, it's that the band has been able to mature ever so gracefully over the course of their career while fundamentally staying true to the original intent that attracted me to them in the first place.<br /><br />To me, it seems like Wilco has always been able to identify and expand upon the raw strenghts of their prior albums in order to produce a more polished and refined sound in each subsequent release.  Regardless of how far they have strayed away from the core sound at times, somehow the root structure has always managed to remain healthy and in tact.<br /><br />Many would argue that the band had a sub-par outing with \\"A Ghost is Born\\", but you'd be a fool to deny that there were threads of the balls-out rock of \\"AM\\" and \\"Being There,\\" the swirling pop and dark undercurrent of \\"Summerteeth,\\" and impeccably layered landscapes of \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" present throughout.  There's something in every Wilco album that sets it apart from the rest, and in the case of AGIB, it was certainly Jeff Tweedy's emergence as a lead guitarist with the sprawling solo at the tail end of \\"At Least That's What You Said\\" being the high-water mark.  In spite of its many faults, I found it to be a very unique and rewarding album.<br /><br />With that being said,<br /><br />It's hard to understand why Jeff would come out and publicly declare to the world that he and his legion of yes-men were working on releasing what he promised to be a \\"super-dirty soul record\\" that would be devoid of all of the hoity-toity poetry that has apparently plagued all of the band's previous releases.<br /><br />Ironically enough, this is, without a doubt, Wilco's most emotionally and creatively shallow effort to date.  Soulful is certainly the last word that comes to mind.<br /><br />With the exception of Jeff Tweedy's voice, there is no Wilco to be found anywhere within any of the 12 jingles featured on \\"Sky Blue Sky.\\"  Each song meanders aimlessly into the next, with hardly a change of rhythm, tone, or theme to be found.  Most of the songs are lyrically driven, which doesn't fare well for Tweedy & Friends since the lyrical passages contained here are some of the most un-effecting and trite that Jeff has ever written.  I can say without a doubt that \\"I Hate it Here\\" is an outright pitiful song.  But, sadly enough, it's about par for the course as far as this album goes.<br /><br />If there was any dynamic of AGIB that I would have liked to have seen them carry along with them into the studio for this album, it would have been Jeff's blistering guitar work. Alas, Rock and Roll guitar has given way to the lounge-pop and easy listening sensibilities of the ever-dexterous Nels Cline.  I liken the guitar noodling on this album to my excruciatingly annoying aunt who makes a sport out of talking more at the dinner table than the rest of the family combined without ever really having anything to say. On a grander scale, the thing that ultimately disappoints me the most is that if this album is of any indication, the current incarnation of Wilco no longer has any aspirations of carrying on in the studio as a Rock and Roll band...<br /><br />I never thought that I would ever see these guys flounder around in a sea of such mediocrity and lameness.  There is truly no substance here to really hang your hat on, and if one thing is certain, no new ground has been broken.  This is without a doubt the most cumbersome album that I have listened to in a very, very long time.<br /><br />Un-eventful, subdued, and monumentally disappointing. A dry-hump if there ever was one.<br /><br />I guess that it can only get better from here.  I don't know, apparently all I have to do is listen to it 257 more times and I'll end up liking it.<br /><br />1.5 Starsone, or theme to be found.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|... and it's not only the Bond of this film which is shaken, but the entire franchise.<br /><br />Fans of the James Bond films have reacted with vituperative insults, slamming the film and (as Daniel Craig mentions in the special effects DVD of the 2-DVD set) sending scathing and vicious hate-mail to the new Bond. I can see why - many watchers of the James Bond films have a very specific idea of what they want in a Bond film, and it's often NOT a case of knowing the books and wanting the films to be faithful to that. How could it be, after all? From Roger Moore onwards, there does seem to have been quite a noticeable swing towards the concept of making James Bond almost a spoof of himself.<br /><br />This film is actually truer to the books than the earlier films were.<br /><br />The \\"traditional\\" James Bond (by which I mean the Bond many viewers today expect, based on the Bond films, especially on the more recent ones) is then not really the \\"real\\" Bond whom Ian Fleming created.<br /><br />I can't pretend to be an avid Bond fan - I'm not. But I've enjoyed pretty much anything that Sean Connery has done, and I feel that Connery did a superb job of creating a ruthless, hard character who was in many ways a sexual predator, a dysfunctional being, but one who was brilliantly unstoppable as a secret agent, and blazing with intelligence, sexual power and suave charm. Roger Moore's Bond was too reminiscent (in my opinion) of Simon Templar, the Saint (a role which I think suited him much better than Bond). And so on... I felt the recent Bonds had wonderful potential, but were hampered by increasingly silly plots and overwhelmed by gadgets. Yes, we all love the spoofiness of all of those gadgets, but they were already too much over the top - they could no longer be taken seriously. Ditto for the villains - they were caricatures rather than serious characters, and because of that, they failed (in my opinion) to present a real source of tension in the films.<br /><br />I'd heard that this film - Casino Royale - was a break in the tradition. I'd admired Daniel Craig's acting in Munich, and thought that this was a Bond film worth watching...<br /><br />... and in my opinion this is a very interesting film, well acted, well scripted, well directed. The film achieved what those involved wanted to achieve - this Bond is a harder, quite brutal Bond without the experience of the later Bonds (because he only gains his double-oh status in the beginning of this film), but still self-aware and with a disarming self-knowledge that has him able to laugh about himself. I found myself believing in this Bond, and that is not something I can say of previous Bonds (except for Sean Connery, but then... Sean Connery, after all... what more need I say?).<br /><br />I think those who want Bond films to have a spoof-like quality with amazing gadgets and unbelievable and over-the-top villains will probably not like this film. For those who want an intelligent and intricate action/thriller, the film will probably please. Daniel Craig is of course an extremely good actor, and he has the right face for this sort of hard-edged role. He is able to express so much just with the look of his eyes and the tiny movement of muscles around the mouth - he does most of his acting with his face. But his physicality comes in very useful here too, in some of the most realistic fight scenes (and a taxing torture scene) that have made it to the screen.<br /><br />The various villains are believably played, and Le Chiffre is particularly well done. Le Chiffre is the sort of villain that previous Bond films would have overplayed.<br /><br />The women are of course all ravishing, and as Vesper Lynd, Eva Green does a good job of creating an initially armoured woman with her own secrets.<br /><br />Unlike many, I very much enjoyed the intricacy of the card game - it's a hard thing to shoot, and it worked for me.<br /><br />There are several quite breathtaking extended chase scenes orfight scenes, and I don't think I'll forget the fight scene on the steel girder, the car chase where Bond's car rolls seven times, and (ouch) the scene in a cellar where Le Chiffre uses a rope on Bond to illustrate how elaborate gadgetry for torture is completely unnecessary.<br /><br />I give this film 5 stars for being successful in its genre. I don't think it's a film without flaws, but the successful tension, exciting look and good acting throughout make it work.tended chase scenes or fight scenes, and I don't think I'll forget the fight scene on the steel girder, the car chase where Bond's car rolls seven times, and (ouch) the scene in a cellar where Le Chiffre uses a rope on Bond to illustrate how elaborate gadgetry for torture is completely unnecessary. <br /> <br />I give this film 5 stars for being successful in its genre.

B000M5AJQS|3.0|I always like Jack Nicholson and I could occasionally (for once) forget <br />that Leonardo DiCaprio was Leonardo DiCaprio, but mostly it just seemed <br />like the movie went on until they had killed off all of the main <br />characters and then it ended. It seemed like there must have been a <br />quota for the f-word (\\"We have to have the f-word in there 100 times <br />with 25 at high volume.\\") And cell phone tricks are rapidly becoming <br />clichéd.

B00005JPDR|4.0|If you're looking for something unusual, unconventional and unpredictable, \\"Perfume\\" is your film. I am not saying this will give a pleasant smell to you. Probably some people would be attracted to the complexity of the strange world where olfactory perception means everything. Or some would loath the film's story and main character itself, especially the conclusion. Whatever you may find it, Tom Tykwer's \\"Perfume\\" remains intriguing throughout as allegorical tale, dark comedy or serial killer suspense. Pick your choice. <br /> <br />With John Hurt as narrator with slightly mocking tone, the eventful life story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is introduced, and from the very first moment you realize \\"Perfume\\" is no ordinary film. The film successfully conveys how Paris in the 18th century (at least one certain district) smelled really bad, with too realistic scene of its fish market, which is followed by the birth of Jean-Baptiste. His life is destined to be a different one, and the first chapter fully convinces us of his fate. <br /> <br />Ben Whishaw plays adult Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, and his wonderful acting as the (anti-)hero virtually carries the entire film to the last. Typical rags-to-riches drama is given a twist when other characters step in his life. First Jean-Baptiste is apprenticed to Giuseppe Baldini, second-rate perfumer who lost his skills. Dustin Hoffman's fake Italian accent may annoy you, but wait for what happens. Jean-Baptiste creates a \\"hit\\" perfume with his superb olfactory sense, making Baldini a rich person, and then ... see it for yourself. The story is not definitely Charles Dickens. <br /> <br />Beautiful Rachel Hurd-Wood and Alan Rickman are both memorable as aristocratic father and his only daughter. Tom Tykwer relies much on their acting talent to create the credible relations between them, which is I think still underwritten and not interesting enough. His skills as director are more effective in presenting Jean-Baptiste who can createthe perfect scent in the most unique and terrifying fashion. <br /> <br />As to its conclusion - don't worry, this is spoiler-free - you will find it either fascinating or just awful. But maybe we shouldn't take the story too seriously for \\"grenouille\\" also means \\"frog\\" in French. \\"Perfume\\" defies easy explanations like real perfumes you smell every day. \\"Perfume\\" has that inexplicable quality that makes itself all the more attractive to us.
6305232660|3.0|The governments of the world find out about an asteroid on a cataclysmic path with our planet.  Our government decides We the People are too stupid and brutish to be trusted to act responsibly with that knowledge, and they use billions of our tax dollars to build a massive shelter for favored citizens, all with great secrecy, with a few remaining slots to be rationed out to the taxpayers via lottery. <br /> <br />The catastrophe wasn't as bad as anticipated, and had the U.S. government not decided to use our tax dollars as their personal piggy bank to provide an \\"ark\\" for politicians and their families and friends, individual citizens could have built shelters or made other provisions that might likely have let them survive the disastrous strike that sent a massive tidal wave surging halfway across the country. <br /> <br />The real disaster was that millions of U.S. citizens died, but all the politicians were saved.  Yeah, that's what I want when it's time to rebuild civilization:  the privileged political class ready to resume Big Government As Usual.  Ugh! <br /> <br />Of course, the movie was fiction.  The bunkers our government has built for themselves and not us, those are real.  While I pray such survivalist measures are never necessary, it does give one a moment of pause to realize that we've financed the safety of a pampered ruling class, while they're telling us to stock up on duct tape and a month's worth of canned goods in case of emergency.
B000L45YEW|4.0|\\"Rob-B-Hood\\" (\\"Bo bui gai wak\\") features the misadventures of three ne'er-do-wells Fong (Jackie Chan), Octopus (Louis Koo) and Landlord (Michael Hui), to whom a new job is assigned from a mobster on the worst day of their lives. That lucrative job involved kidnapping a baby, but because of their slight mistakes gambling bachelor Fong and lady's man Octopus are forced to take care of the baby on their own. <br /> <br />\\"Rob-B-Hood\\" is a Jackie Chan film, which means it contains actions. Though the film has several above-average action sequences, Chan and director Benny Chan (who helmed Jackie's \\"Who Am I?\\" and \\"New Police Story\\") is more interested in character-driven dramas. Consequently the film's middle part slows down considerably with subplots about Jackie Chan and Louis Koo's characters, both of whom act out of selfishness at first, and then begin to behave like mother and father to the kidnapped baby. The plot is predictable and overlong, and you may say these non-action sequences could be left out in the finished version, but the drama part is not bad as you may think. (By the way, the episode about the illness of Fong's father is part based on the real-life event that happened to Jackie's own mother, and this may explain his acting which is more intense than usual. <br /> <br />It is amazing to see Jackie Chan (52 years old, remember?) is still nimble and doing stunts himself, but at the same time the obvious use of special effects in some actions may be disappointing to some fans. This is not to say his stunts are not dangerous - see the end credit bloopers, and you know it - but well-choreographed as they are, action sequences could have been much better with new ideas like more original use of props. <br /> <br />Comic thesp Michael Hui is always funny, and Louis Koo shows some wonderful action stunts. \\"Rob-B-Hood\\" also stars familiar faces in Hong-Kong films such as Yuen Biao, cute Charlene Choi, plus lovely Yuanyuan Gao from mainland China. Many cameo appearances from Hong Kong film industry would also delight the fans, but the greatest scene stealer of the film is of course, Matthew Medvedev or Baby Matthew, who actually is nominated as Hong Kong Film Award's Best New Performer. <br /> <br />\\"Rob-B-Hood\\" is a quite entertaining popcorn movie with great set-pieces. There is nothing new storywise, but it delivers with its real stars, thrilling actions and the adorable baby
0195145925|4.0|This book, which is flawed & a bit messy, is a fascinating mind-game about what happens if we nix Time or rather Time directionality. We get time-stop-photography wave-function \\"manifolds\\", eigenstates, machine-thought, reductio ad absurdum. Humans see at 70 frames/second, so, no chance of us handling light-speed + quantum, unless we get implants.<br /><br />I like Barbour's Platonia analogy of \\"quantum stasis\\" (P.305). Also his Zen-like Gaussian \\"becoming-ness\\". Time is a self-referential human artifice (Leibnitz). To explain Barbour's dogmatic idea of illusion, he posits that the stasis-Platonia is 'fixed' like the 3D turntable of Manhattan in Lauryn Hill's 'Everything is everything\\". Except the turntable is quantum-flux static. There can be no real Alpha point or Omega point, so one assumes the Big Bang was an illusion. Quantum particles do not obey distance or time & are 5th dimensional. In reality, all 'snapshots' are synchronous. Hence, we and all things that ever were, are alive and dead at the same time in the ETERNAL NOW. Just with \\"Platonian\\" separations.<br /><br />Heisenberg's dE * dt > h means time is subordinated to energy flow. How we \\"see\\" a movie (film strip) is because of the film strip's movement (energy) creating a forward sequence. Time-v-energy is determined by E = mc2 so that the 'now' of different objects is different. One needs a grasp of Mach's principles here.<br /><br />If absolute time is DEAD, it means revising all previous metaphysics.<br /><br />Also \\"time travel\\" becomes a whole different prospect, & curious questions then arise. I don't think Barbour has anything like the total picture, but he's dipping into a Pandora's Box of quantum weirdness. An open mind is categorically required for this stuff.

Crosby had been the \\" Bad Byrd\\", Stills was the hub of Buffalo Springfield, and Nash headlined The Hollies. Each talent was restless and in search of support for their respective artistic visions. Never has a blending of styles, as well as  vocal harmonies, been so compatible.<br /><br />CSN released their debut in the spring of 1969, just in time to fly up the charts before Woodstock. One of the special features about this recording is the stamp each artist places on his work, while allowing the other two to join in for a unique sum that's more than it's parts. Taken apart these men are talented, but something is missing after hearing them together.<br /><br />Crosby is the rebel, Stills the perfectionist and Nash the heartbeat. \\"Suite Judy Blue Eyes\\", a classic rock staple/tribute to Judy Collins, opens the album. Stills makes it his by trailing off into speaking Spanish at the end, leaving  Crosby and Nash to provide the pretty melodies. Graham Nash's \\" Marrakesh Express\\" is a hold-over from his days in The Hollies, but fits in perfectly here. It rolls along like a train, giving the listener a sense of being high on travel and in love.<br /><br />Crosby gets in a word with \\" Guinevere\\", a beautiful ballad written as a composite of Joni and another girlfriend. One of the greatest compliments a song can receive is providing inspiration for another great song; \\"Wooden Ships\\" gave Jackson Browne the desire to respond in his superior work \\" For Everyman\\". I must admit that \\" Wooden Ships\\" sounded like a song dedicated to Holocaust survivors to me when I first heard it, and in some ways I found it more poignant in that vein than it's real meaning, thoughts from refugees in a nuclear stand-off.<br /><br />\\" Lady of the Island\\" is another highlight; wouldn't all ladies like to have a Graham Nash in her life? \\" Helplessly Hoping\\" is another timeless classic.

0743298020|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I loved the language, the spellbinding storytelling, the characters. I couldn't stop turning pages to find out what was going to happen but at the same time I wanted the story to go on forever.<br /><br />I was slightly disappointed in the ending - it seemed a bit pulled out of thin air - and I still don't understand how Margaret could have seen the ghost since we found out what the ghost was. (I don't want to say more for fear of spoiling the story for those who haven't read it.)<br /><br />Anyway, the ending does not keep me from recommending this wonderfully, enjoyable novel. I've already started reading it again myself.
B000002MFE|5.0|The universal concensus in fall of 1992 was the brilliance of Eric Clapton's new release \\" Unplugged\\". My seventeen year old peers loved this disc with equal devotion to match the lifelong admiration of my fifty year old father. Of course, Clapton had touched a nerve with the beautifully written tribute to his sweet son, \\" Tears in Heaven\\". Once this disc was in possession, though, a whole new fan base was proclaiming \\" Clapton is God\\", at least God of the guitar.<br /><br />\\" Signe\\", a nice little ditty to set the mood, opens the CD. It's a warm feeling, as if sitting around a fire, listening to the best musician in the group show his chops. These Unplugged sessions have a plastic feeling many times, but not in Clapton's case. He brought a seasoned sensitivity that colors the whole album.<br /><br />Blues take a bow with \\" Before You Accuse Me\\" and \\" Hey Hey\\". \\" Lonely Stranger\\" is followed by \\" Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\\", a song where the upbeat melody contradicts the dour lyrics. \\" Layla\\" gets a sophisticated face-lift, while \\" Alberta\\" and \\" San Francisco Bay Blues\\" bounce around from strolling to skipping. \\" Old Love\\" sounds even better live than it did on \\" Journeyman\\". \\" Rollin' and Tumblin'\\", the closer, allows the artist to end on a high note, giving a mid-tempo flavor to an old blues classic.<br /><br />Essential.

1400079594|5.0|The Code of the Woosters opens with Bertram Wooster's favourite aunt arriving unannounced with a request that Bertie go visit an antique dealer and cast aspersions on a silver cow creamer as a ruse to bring the price down for Bertie's uncle, a fanatical cow creamer collector.<br /><br />Unfortunately a rival collector buys it before Bertie can get into his act and to make matters worse it is a judge with whom our hero has had a run in. We follow the further meetings and doings of Bertie Wooster through a mirthful chain of people and merry events which tangles itself about poor Bertie linking him to that blasted cow creamer like a prisoner to his iron ball, until finally Bertie's valet Jeeves as usual frees him from the whole mess and rids him of all worries.<br /><br />But what the deuce is a cow creamer anyway? It is a vessel, part of a dessert and coffee service, used to serve cream and shaped in the form of a cow. Of course that's what it had to be, and I would have figured it out on my own too. After all anyone will tell you that grand old chap Vincent is no stranger to the more rarified items of trivia and that he can trivialize with the best of them. There's always something working in the old bean as they say. In any case, I'd have been able to figure out the purpose of this object, from the name alone in fact, had I for a minute imagined it possible that such a silly thing could have existed in the first place.<br /><br />That the book follows P.G. Wodehouse's classic Jeeves & Wooster formula doesn't make it less entertaining, nor does it eliminate all surprises. Great fun.<br /><br />Trivia: The Code of the Woosters is set in the late 1930s, just before WWII and Wodehouse satirizes Hitler in much the same way Charlie Chaplin did in is film \\"The Great Dictator\\".<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Dublin
B000J103PC|4.0|\\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" based on the famously-hilarious novel, is a fairly conventional, if glossy, coming of age tale.  Despite a pretty funny script (watered down from the book) and the usual acting talent present in a major Hollywood production (Anne Hathaway in the title role, Stanley Tucci as a flamboyant designer, etc.), the movie is saved from mediocrity by the performance of Meryl Streep. <br /> <br />This wonderful actor, who made her name in such \\"difficult\\" movies as \\"The French Lieutenant's Woman\\" and \\"Kramer versus Kramer,\\" sinks her teeth into the role of Miranda Priestley, the editor in chief of \\"Runway,\\" a fashion magazine.  Priestley has dyed her hair the charming color of steel on a cold day and is one of the leading lights of the fashion world.  She also is the most demanding and unreasonable boss since Kevin Spacey in \\"Swimming With Sharks.\\"  To say that Streep takes on this role with glee is an understatement. <br /> <br />But Priestley is the villain of this piece (or is she . . .).  The heroine is Andrea Sachs (Ms. Hathaway).  A recent graduate of Northwestern University and editor of the prestigious student paper, Ms. Sachs has come to New York with hopes of writing for Vanity Fair or The New Yorker.  Thanks to the screenplay, Andrea gets a job that she doesn't want but is one - as she is told repeatedly - that \\"a million girls would kill for.\\"  This is one of those \\"too-good-to-be-true\\" situations one encounters only on movies or TV - kind of like the apartment on \\"Friends.\\"  But it's needed as a plot device - you couldn't tell a coming-of-age story about a girl who knew that a million girls got the job and still got the job, because that girl knows how the world works.   <br /> <br />So commences the education of Andrea.  At first, Andrea - like many in the audience - looks down on the fashion world as super-silly fluff.  Things begin to change as she sees what a dynamic business mind Miranda has, and also when Miranda gives Andrea the detailed fashion history of the frumpy blue sweater she wore to work that day.  Eventually, Andrea sees the light, and after a helpful fashion lesson from Stanley Tucci, starts to wear great clothes and also stop eating so she can become a reasonably satisfactory size 4.   <br /> <br />This sets up a typical scenario where Andrea starts to lose her old friends to the demands of her job.  Her boyfriend - who looks 18 but will end up becoming the sous chef for a pretigious restaurant (yeah, right) - is typically unsupportive.  The only friend who showed promise was a guy who showed an unnerving fascination with fashion, but that subplot goes nowhere.  But these friends serve as the counterpoint to Miranda, setting up the ultimate choice for Andrea - who does she want to be?  Rich, famous and unhappy, like Miranda?  Or herself?  Ten cents if you guess who she wants to be. <br /> <br />Ultimately, this is what is unsatisfying about the movie.  Miranda is not unhappy - she loves who she is and wouldn't be anyone else.  It's just for Miranda, things like a marriage come second.  But we never get a sense of who Andrea wants to be - she's nice, but we see nothing of what animates her as a journalist.  Does she want to be a globe-trotting foreign correspondent?  A literary critic?  An advice columnist?  We are left to wonder, but then we already know that we are more interested in Miranda than Andrea anyway. <br /> <br />A fine movie for the younger set - a lot of young people could benefit from even the most shallow bit of introspection.  But if you're looking for a great movie, skip \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\"  That is, unless you want to watch Meryl Streep give a master's class in acting.
B00065MDS6|5.0|The reason King Crimson's Lizard album is so great is simple- from beginning to end, the album is filled with little creative musical bits.  From \\"cirkus\\" all the way to the end of the 23-minute epic, this album contains hidden musical journeys in the background of the music, behind the lead singer.  Little entertaining bits of piano, drums, mellotron and other instruments playing throughout the entire album in the background, and many people who dismiss this album don't even notice what's going on back there.  It ends up making the whole album feel very jazzy and intense.   <br /> <br />I also don't get all the complaints about the lead singers voice.  He's not a gifted singer, but he's nowhere near the worst out there.  You might even say his voice can be quite pretty and believable during certain parts.   <br /> <br />For someone like me who likes music that's WAY out there, this is certainly a very comfortable listen for me.  Little bits of creativity are just bursting all OVER the place.  Great album.
B000O178BY|4.0|I grew up with Trent Reznor's music. I'm in my early 30s now, but at some embarrassing point in my early to mid teens, that magical time in every Westerner's life when you're especially susceptible to especially brilliant marketing (and Mr. Reznor is undoubtedly a marketing genius on par with Steve Jobs or Gene Simmons), I have to admit that NIN was pretty much a religion for me. I bought _Broken_ on the day of its release, and it's still my favorite of the artist's oeuvre-- perhaps not the most innovative thing he's ever done, but it's truly unmatched in terms of fury, and it helped me make the leap to my very belated love of metal. _The Downward Spiral_ came out toward the end of my senior year of high school, and I believe this release is not given nearly enough credit for its far-reaching and often imperceptible influence. Years later, I'd hear stodgy electronic composers in the academic realm singing that album's praises.  <br /> <br />But _The Fragile_ came out while I was in the midst of my first run through grad school, while I was indeed studying composition, and my NIN-love was quickly becoming a distant memory through neglect. Sprawling, uninventive, self-indulgent and totally unconvincing, the release of _The Fragile_ was the definitive point at which I stopped caring very much about the acquisition of any further Halos.  <br /> <br />And while I had hopes that _With Teeth_ might be some kind of return to artistic form circa the halcyon days of TDS, or at least a very much needed reinvention of the extraordinarily gifted Mr. Reznor... yeah... no. Here we have a guy, a millionaire in his 40s, whose sonic innovations of the early 1990s helped define whole genres and pretty much single-handedly inspired the industry switchover from tape to DAW technology, still trying to court a new generation of teenagers and convince them-- kind of like a creepy lingering guy in the Quik-E-Mart parking lot after the last school bell of the day-- that he is Tortured Just Like Them through a bunch of painfully \\"radio-friendly\\" but ultimately unmemorable tunes. His trademark sonic perversion and invention were nowhere in sight, replaced with nothing but totally confused cross-genre pastiche that copied others extensively as opposed to offering up any kind of musical innovation. I gave up all hope that there'd ever be a compelling NIN release ever again.  <br /> <br />All that said, I am surprised to find that I'm enjoying most of _Year Zero_ a great deal. The Bush administration and the continuing terrifying rise of the Evangelical crazy has given Reznor a shot of much-needed, and inexplicably belated, inspiration. Granted, songs like \\"Capital G\\" are so obvious that we right-minded, righteous liberals over the age of 18 will likely cringe a bit-- think Rage Against the Machine with (thankfully!) a little more refinement and a bit more of a lyrical point. But I'm glad to see Reznor has sensibly found something to rail against furiously that isn't a girl or something. It's so much prettier, more palatable and more satisfying to see a forty-something millionaire justifiably complaining about the present domestic situation than about his own personal woes, which I always suspected he was totally making up anyway after 1992 or so. I just wonder why he took so long... did his publicist insist that he wait until Dubya's approval rating had sat at under 50% for more than a year? <br /> <br />Anyway, musically speaking, Year Zero still isn't as innovative as I'd really like, with parts of it reminding me a great deal of the accomplishments of, say, Mouse on Mars 7-10 years ago... but it's very satisfying to listen to and far more experimental than his previous two full-length efforts. There's a much simpler, obviously more insular approach to creation on this record-- the clearest evidence being the general lack of real drums throughout-- that I find very rewarding and personal. It sounds like Reznor had a lot of fun making it, which-- at leastfrom my perspective-- has not been the case for a long time. As opposed to _With Teeth,_ _Year Zero_ doesn't make me shudder at its pop cynicism. It sounds like Reznor is shaking loose of the tried-and-tired lyrical / aesthetic formula that's been haunting him and holding him back for a long time, learning to forget the perceptions of his audience / cult just a little bit... and doing all this just enough to get back in touch with his real talents, to make some quality music that intelligent grownups can enjoy... the first time he's actually pulled this off in a long time. It's not compelling all the way through; there are still a few obvious filler moments, and the \\"new\\" sonic approach does get a little same-y as the album progresses. But there's a lot of great stuff in here-- a lot more than I was expecting for certain.  <br /> <br />Keep it up, Mr. Reznor. I'm rootin' for you. I now believe you have at least one more landmark album in you. You just have to be brave enough to find it, and _Year Zero_ is definitely a step in the right direction.
B000002L6U|5.0|For years I was led to believe this was Eric Clapton's worst album, and that the very first track was the only one worth hearing.  NOT TRUE.  Every song is quite enjoyable.  Just because it was recorded in the 80's when the recording industry was giving us big drum machines and loud guitars doesn't mean this album is horrible.  It's still Eric Clapton.  Granted, it's the studio version of Eric Clapton which produced normal-sounding songs that range from ballads to light rockers, but it's still a darn good listen.
0553582461|3.0|In my review of [[ASIN:0553582445 Fool's Errand]], I said that it took me a while to get into this series. Indeed, I had picked up that first book twice just to set it aside, so frustrated was I with its interminably slow pacing. In the end, I was glad I gave it a third chance, because the book held true to the promise that I felt any book with Fitz and the Fool should possess. It was a delight. <br /> <br />[[ASIN:0553582445 Fool's Errand]] finished with grand momentum, and that momentum didn't stall in [[ASIN:0553582453 Golden Fool]]. Yet, after reading 150 pages of this book, I found myself putting one of Ms. Hobb's books down yet again. Looking back at when I wrote the reviews for the other two books, I see that I set it aside for almost seven months. The first 150 pages of this book read like an encyclopedia. Every page felt like a chore. <br /> <br />Ms. Hobb is a meticulous writer, and I have always admired her for that, and been glad for it, as it has enhanced my experience as a reader. But here that meticulousness felt rather thin, and instead of necessary, things felt drawn out. I wasn't dazzled as I (eventually) was in [[ASIN:0553582445 Fool's Errand]], nor was I as mesmerized by the myriad plot threads evident in [[ASIN:0553582453 Golden Fool]]. <br /> <br />This book tells the story of Prince Dutiful, Chade, Fitz, and his coteries, as they travel first to the Out Islands and the Narcheska's mothershouse, and then to Askeyvjal (sp?) Island so that Dutiful can carry out the seemingly childish quest that his bride-to-be, the Narcheska, has given him - to bring back the head of Icefyre. <br /> <br />There's a *lot* of traveling and complaining in this book. We go over seas, and trudge over glaciers. And Thick, Dutiful's half-wit and part of his Skill coterie, isn't made of stern enough stuff for this journey. The boats make him sick, and the snow makes him cold. His constant whining was annoying, and I found myself hoping that they would dump him off the boat, or let him slide down a crack in the glacier and just leave him there. He had a purpose, yes, and I recognize and understand the necessity of his character. However, he was an unlooked for burden. Both to those he traveled with and to this reader. <br /> <br />Granted, Ms. Hobb does surprise us. Many writers would simply give their readers a quest to go and fight a dragon, and that's what the characters would do. Not so here. There are many subplots to this quest, and they broaden, again, our understanding of the vast world that Ms. Hobb has imagined. <br /> <br />However, I didn't find myself surprised or delighted as much as I believe I should have been. When the main subplot announced itself, I thought - oh, cool. And that was it. <br /> <br />I'm of two minds on this book, and several on the ending. It was a *long* ending, similar to what happened in [[ASIN:0788789848 The Return of the King]]after Frodo completed his quest and Gondor had its king. I appreciated the time that Ms. Hobb put into wrapping up some of her complex threads, especially the personal ones, and amongst those, prominently the relationship between the Fool and Fitz. <br /> <br />Their friendship is easily one of the most unconventional and startling ones in contemporary fantasy, and I applaud Ms. Hobb. Not many writers would tackle issues that could cause close-minded people to drop her book and write it off. She handled this so cautiously and carefully, and succeeded on crafting a love that has not, in my reading experience, been duplicated anywhere within this genre. <br /> <br />However, I found that when I put the book down, I was glad it was over. That's not the feeling I want after devoting so much time to reading somewhere around 1,800 pages of fiction. All the love and care and concern that I had for many of the characters was no longer there.  <br /> <br />It seemed to me that, while Ms. Hobb didn't shortchange us on any of the threads that she tied up, she didn't spend enough time - or didn't have enough time to spend - editing. There were numerous rookie mistakes everywhere, the most common of these was to use the same word within the same paragraph more than once - like throne. In one paragraph, that word was used around four times, and there were better sentences that could have been constructed without using that word. <br /> <br />So while the threads were all tied up, it felt rushed because it didn't have Ms. Hobb's usual stamp of perfection on it, and the book in general was much drier than the previous two - indeed, the previous eight in this series. She left room at the end for sequels, but truth be told, I doubt that I'll read them. <br /> <br />To give this a 2 star review would be to say that I didn't like this book, and I can't bring myself, even with all of the objections I have, to say so. While not up to her usual work, I'd still read this over anything by Goodkind, Eddings, or Brooks. It may have been dry, but it was intelligent and well-crafted. So, 3 stars. <br />
B00000IMTE|5.0|Rainbow's debut is a great thrill if you're a big fan of Deep Purple's classic lineup (Machine Head in particular).  Blackmore continues his melodically soothing guitar sound on this album.  \\"catch the rainbow\\" is probably the best song here because it will remind you of a sunset in Louisiana and hearing crickets.  \\"man on the silver mountain\\" is another highlight, and was even a big hit for a brief period in the mid 70's.  If you like \\"smoke on the water\\" you will like this song too, no doubt. <br /> <br />\\"temple of the king\\" is probably the song to stand out the most because it's a really good adventurous-fantasy type song.  It reminds me of that early 80's movie called The Neverending Story.  No, not the theme song, I mean the movie itself.  Remember that movie?  It was about a boy who goes on a magical journey using his imagination.  This movie and that song are so similar to each other it's not even funny.   <br /> <br />Despite that, this album is mostly about having fun and rocking out with lots of guitars and a really good classic rock sound.  Perhaps the best sound a rock record can have found right here.  This is mostly a guitar-driven album, with the guitar being the main feature.  Worth a purchase?  Absolutely.
0593055489|4.0|He's not Satan incarnate, Kirkus reviews, but D is definitely his pawn. Doesn't matter if you believe in Satan's existence or not, D's methods are as old as sin - Discredit and displace God. D says as much on pg 12, he wants himself via his books to have the same power he claims religion had in past centuries - \\"transcendent wonder\\". Satan has always been after Gods glory.  <br />I'm definitely not in `the choir\\" but I read the book. Not only did I read it, I think it's safe to say I read most of it twice with all the interruptions I had and the notes I took. Out of 374 pages in this book I took 236 notes (found a typo on p 264) on things I found fault with. What should be a concern is all the fence sitters out there, or Christians who don't know their stuff. They'll read this book and believe its lies and deceit, there's much to choose from.  It would do everyone well to read alot of the `other view'. Let's imagine that there is only one `other view' since D very obviously is only out to discredit Yahweh though he hides, not very well, behind the banner of all religions must go. <br /> <br />*D starts off with the victim's cry. His wife's story (and others) about how she was forced into her parents beliefs because she didn't know she could speak out against them. (he'll gather a following from the liberal left on this point alone)  <br />*Later, D likens the atheists cause to the homosexuals and says that atheists need to follow suit (which they have been doing already in the powerful and well funded ACLU); <br />*He attempts to make a case of how politically powerful evangelicals are in the USA (yeah right, that's why Darwinism is still the only theory taught in public schools, abortion is flourishing, etc., etc.); <br />*He claims scientists, mostly atheist, are forced to keep it a secret or fake some sort of religious belief or lose funding, jobs, respect (see rae.org > interview with Dr. Larry Bergman who lists by name and location 3000 Ph.D. level scientists who are \\"Darwin doubters\\" and who says many more won't get put on his list for fear it could jeopardize their career)  <br />*He misquotes certain Founding Fathers of the USA and claims it was not started as a Christian nation. ( D was so ignorant to even go there, see Original Intent by David Barton.) <br />*He says religion is not a proper field where one can claim expertise then totally mistranslates everything he says about the Bible and tries to make it sound official by throwing in things like `most theologians agree'... <br /> <br />Of course D goes into natural selection (ns) and is an obvious lover of Darwin but there are plenty of `other view' books already written counteracting that. I hope anyone reading D's book would read them, you know, just to raise consciousness.  <br /> <br />In the God of the gaps section, he accuses the \\"fundies\\" of filling God in the gaps of everything they can't explain. (I found ns had similar tendencies, if certain things can't be explained then it's creative ns, stabilizing selection, resistance to extinction, mosaic evolution, invisible peripheral isolates, unconscious evolution, memetic natural selection of some kind, misfiring, Darwinian mistake or by-product, or fossils aren't needed anyway.)  <br /> <br />Having said in another reply on this site something to the effect of \\"I don't need evidence anyway\\" I was thrilled to find out that D doesn't either, which means he and his followers can understand what faith is. NS is not true and evolution is not proven (even if it were I still wouldn't like D's style), no matter how many times certain reviewers say so and the only `evidence' D has regarding the origin of life is: <br /> \\"stroke of luck\\" (p140); <br /> \\"lucky chance\\" (p139); <br /> And on p 137 + 144 +366 (I love this part) \\" The origin of life was the chemical event, or series of events...the major ingredient was heredity, either DNA or RNA. Once the vital ingredient - some kind of genetic molecule - is in place, true Darwinian ns can follow...\\" , \\"Why did it have to be the kind of universe which seems almost as if...it must have known we were coming.\\" , \\"Think about it. On one planet, and possibly only one planet in the entire universe, molecules that would normally make nothing more complicated than a chunk of rock, gather themselves together into chunks of rock-sized matter of such staggering complexity that they are capable of running, jumping, swimming, flying, seeing, hearing, etc.\\" Sure sounds like Genesis 2:7, eh? <br />D had to put this in here for laughs, he couldn't possibly be so obviously deceitful as to think anyone would believe this leap of faith is any different than `if God says so then it is so'. God formed us, He breathed life into us, He prepared the earth for us, He has a plan for us. Call it God or call it ns, it's faith in luck or faith in God, but D definitely has faith. <br /> <br />As if that's not enough he says a personal God probably doesn't exist and couldn't possible hear all prayers, be involved in all lives, etc., yet D attributes abilities like these to ns. On p 163 \\" Darwin explained ns as daily and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest...\\"; p 221 \\"ns programmed into our brains altruistic urges, sexual urges...\\"; p 217 \\"ns...predisposes individuals...to give...to solicit...remember obligations, bear grudges.\\"  <br /> <br />I could go on and on, this book is full of opinions, stereotypes, deceit. Was it worth the time? I've wasted time in worse ways. If nothing else it's put me on even firmer ground. What appeared as an intellectual group to me has turned out to be a delusion.   <br />I gotta go, it's time for my 3 year olds Bible study. <br />
B000002LMK|5.0|Ragged Glory is perhaps Neil Young's best album, and that's really saying something considering I own and love Rust Never Sleeps. <br /> <br />I can't help it- the overall sound of Ragged Glory is that of hard rock and a distint, muddy rock sound buried in the mix.  It really works.  Sometimes you hear these muddy guitars playing behind a country-sounding song and Neil's vocal work, while other times they're playing behind melodic, lengthy jams.  A really good album here, folks.  Nothing else like it.
B00005JPGO|5.0|I give this movie 5 stars.  The acting is great and the story brings home to America the price paid for one of our luxuries.  Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best.
B00005JPCD|2.0|That Oh! So! Slow! beginning - which went on to and even more Oh! So Slow Middle! <br /> <br />Playing Golden Oldies music does not improve or hide the fact that this is not really a Musical Movie. The last third was really the whole film. <br /> <br />This would make a really good educational short film for 5-10 year old in the classroom, it covers all the points needed to help children understand the impact human greed is having on the wildlife. <br /> <br />I suspect this is what Happy Feet actually started life as, and cannot understand why it was thought that adding upbeat music would add anything to the film. <br /> <br />Computerised cartooning technology has made it possible to take many short cuts and turn out cartoons extremely fast. It strikes me that more cartooning was produced than was actually needed to tell the story. Maybe this explains the over-usage of Golden Oldies music and heavy use of Bible Belt choir songs, rap and soul music. Surely there are more creative ways to present ignorance than that! <br /> <br />They had the footage they had to use it!!!! <br /> <br />Methinks that if they had spent more time studying musicals and tap dancing they would not have missed the opportunity to present tap dancing in all it's forms. The inclusion of tap standards could have improved this film tremdously. Somehow tap, rap and soul does not really work. <br /> <br />Yep it is different - but do be prepared to find something to do such as getting out the knitting for the first two thirds and just listen to the music. You won't miss much by not seeing the visuals. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JLKN|2.0|Nothing new here, this is simply a pale copy of the first movie \\"The silence of the lambs\\", there is absolutely nothing new here.  The kind of movie we have seen over and over again. Stick with the first movie.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|A very impressive package.  You simply must buy the CD/DVD combo.  I love the commentary of the videos; very informative and entertaining, and also I really love the making of BellaDonna segment (you all who are old enough will surely recognize the good ol' BETA videos!).  Don't know why \\"Gypsy\\" wasn't on there; I love that too!  There's other Fleetwood Mac songs on there; so who knows.  The \\"Scarlett\\" version of Stand Back is well worth the price of admission.  Very funny commentary on this as well.  Any hardcore Stevie fan simply must have this package.  I agree though about the photo book.  Not much to it.
B00000GAMF|5.0|This is a conceptual album, I have to admit that when it came out, I was still stuck in Fish's era.  My opinion at the moment was that Marillion could never create an album as strong as Misplaced Childhood.  This was a mistake, Brave is a masterpiece and the ending track \\"The great escape\\" is one of the greatest from the band, after all these years, I can tell that this is one of my favorite Marillion's album, if not my favorite. <br />Highly recommanded for any progressive music fans !
B000N3ST9I|1.0|This band sucks beyond belief, I saw them in concert with Lamb of God and Trivium, and they are by far the worst band I have seen.
B000031XCR|2.0|Once again the music industry must ask why so many users are turning to online P2P services, such as WINMX, Face facts, here is a Celine Dion's Greatest hits, and it does not include all her greatest hits. Instead they leave off songs such as WHERE DOES MY HEART BEAT NOW, and WATER FROM THE MOON, among others, WHY??? Simple, its a CASH GRAB!!! More than likely in a year or two they will release a double CD set with the previously mentioned tunes and more filler, as this CD has. HELLO!!!!!!!!!!! Wake up to reality and put all her greatest hits on 1 cd, and stop the GREED. Too many times you see greatest hits complilations from a group or artist and they have purposely left off great charted tunes, so they can put out yet another CD to make money. Once again trying to soak the consumer for more cash. Time to boycott these record company thieves. No offence too online CD services such as CD now or others, they are great and only deliver what is given to them.
B000M4RG42|1.0|The movie was well filmed.  The plot and dialogue while possibly accurate was dull and boring.  One of the worst war movies I have seen.  I own it but not for long.
055358202X|4.0|I just finished reading this yesterday.  Over the last few weeks I've read the entire Song for the first time.  Generally, I believe that even though this isn't the best book of those published so far (perhaps because he had to split the volume, but considering the time it's taking to release the other half, that seems to be a fairly empty excuse), I do believe that it is still a fairly good work that continues the story for a good set of characters in Westeros. <br /> <br />The main characters are progressing and have interesting plots, and it's starting to blur as whether the bad guys are really all that bad.  Exceptions like Gregor, the Companions, etc. are clearly bad, but are the Lannisters really so bad?  Is Jaime's reputation really a misunderstanding?  And even though Cersei may be bad... I certainly don't want her dead anytime soon, she's at her sexiest in this book. <br /> <br />As good as a lot of the book is, there are parts where it becomes irritable with descriptions of places or things that just don't seem to matter a page later.  I even found myself dozing off a few times, which I never did while reading the first two books, and only a couple times with the third.  Not only was this downright boring in places, it was also in sufficient amount to affect how I rate the entire book.  But, I have a theory that may explain it, or at least put it in perspective. <br /> <br />In each book thus far, imo, the book starts off interesting, slides into some a lot of explanations and foreshadowing, then ends on an interesting note.  Like each book, the series seems to be doing the same, A Game of Thrones was very interesting (Best so far, imo), and from there we're getting into a lot of explanations and foreshadowing, etc., you know to set up for the climax.  This being the middle of the series, as in the middle of the book can be boring, but you MUST read it to get the details and know the significance of things past and things to come.  There's no way around it, and thus this book does have importance to the series and should be read. <br /> <br />It's really not as bad as some reviews have made it out to be, it's actually pretty good and has those cliffhangers and makes you wonder... what was the word she said?  she's blind?!?!  and more. <br /> <br />I'm giving it 4 stars, only because 3 seems too low, 3.5 would be about right. <br /> <br />(imo = in my opinion)
B00005JPAO|1.0|I don't even know where to begin with my review of The Queen other than to say that it's so boring that you should ideally have another DVD going at the same time on a second screen, playing something like \\"Gone in 60 Seconds,\\" unless you want to catch up on some sleep. <br /> <br />Obviously when I saw \\"The Queen\\" in the theater I didn't have the capability of watching another movie at the same time, but that didn't stop me from spending my time wishing I did.  Here are my thoughts while watching \\"The Queen\\": <br /> <br />-This is great.  I'm going to learn a lot about The Queen of Europe watching this movie. <br />-What's she doing?  Walking from one room into another?  Well, I guess Queens do have to do that. <br />-I can't believe that The King of Queens has been on TV for so many years.  But Kevin James is very, very funny. <br />-You know what was a good movie?  Hitch.  I think Will Smith and Kevin James should do another movie where they have to travel across the country in a car and maybe one of them is a cop and the other is a bad guy.  That would be hilarious. <br />-Oh, the Queen is taking her dogs out.  Right.  I'm so sure she doesn't have people that do that for her.   <br />-Hey, how come there's nothing about the King?  No offense to women, but isn't the King more powerful than the Queen?  I mean, I have played Rummy before. <br />-Juice Newton should have done the soundtrack to this movie. <br />-Oh my God the Queen still isn't doing anything in this movie except talking and thinking.  No wonder people didn't vote for her for a second term! <br />-I liked that woman who played The Queen in \\"Naked Gun.\\"  She was hilarious and it taught me that Queens have a human side, which this movie is not doing. <br />-Tony Blair is a good actor.   <br />-I think the King is being played by the guy from \\"Babe\\"!  He should say, \\"that'll do, Queen.  That'll do.\\"  That would be awesome.  Wait a minute, did he just say something cool?  Oh, no.  My mistake. <br />-I'vegot to see \\"The Great Muppet Caper\\" again.  I spend too much time focusing on the first movie and when they took over Manhattan.  I wish I was alive when muppets took over Manhattan, because that must have dominated the news. <br />-I've got to go get a snack. <br />-Alright.  Twizzlers and cherry coke.  Sweet!  If I bite off the end of this Twizzler, I can totally have an edible straw.  What did I miss?  The Queen is making a speech?  Terrific.  That's new and exciting.  I'll have to remember to go back and watch that part when I rent the DVD in the month of Nevertember. <br />-Thank God for the closing credits.  I wonder where I parked.  Maybe the Queen can help jumpstart my car.  Not. <br /> <br />So basically, there are lots of plot holes and nothing interesting that happened in this movie, except things that were Twizzler-related.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|After watching the magnificent Sci-Fi series, I wondered if there would be some \\"spinoffs\\" of the masterpiece, finally I found Serenity, with all the crews back in the film, with even better performance. <br />Maybe It's the best farewell to the crew, to the director, to Serenity.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|All sex aside, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I laughed, I cried, I was intrigued, I was appauled. When I stopped watching this movie, I left with just an overall happy feeling. I immediately shared it with my best friend and she agreed. A very well done film, the sex is explicit, but it's clearly not a porn.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this film!!!
B000N4SHPS|5.0|When I first heard that Sylvester Stallone was making yet another Rocky film, I laughed to myself. I couldn't conceive how the movie was going to have any credibility. After all, Stallone seemed to have lost the plot in Rocky 5 and he is now sixty years of age. I anticipated this latest installment would be something of an inadvertent comedy. However, driven by curiosity and a sentimental attachment to the early Rocky movies, I ventured down to the cinema on saturday night for a late showing. Jaded, following two consecutive twelve hour shifts, I stumbled into screen 1 barely retaining my bucket of popcorn and diet coke. I found my seat, took a deep breath and regained my composure. <br /> <br />The Opening scene shows current heavyweight champ Mason Dixon successfully defending his title in a one-sided no thrills affair. The commentary team discuss the current poor state of the lack-lustre heavyweight division and cry out for a meaningful Dixon title defence against a passionate challenger. The undeniably skilful Mason reigns superior but without a serious rival remains an unknown quantity in the courage department. Meanwhile Rocky is struggling to come to terms with the death of his beloved wife Adrian. She passed away years earlier but Balboa is clearly still grieving. In moving scenes he visits her grave and the old neighbourhood in Philadelphia to reminisce about the good times, pausing by old haunts which include the pet shop and Mickey's gym. Rocky, now retired from boxing runs an Italian restaurant aptly named 'Adrian's'. He entertains diners with fight tales from a bygone age and cuts a sad though charismatic figure. A tv sports network discuss how champions from differen't era's would fare against each other. They pit Balboa against current champ Dixon in a simulated computer fight. The fantasy cyber match results in Rocky winning the bout via knock-out. This gets Balboa's juices flowing and the italian stallion contemplates a low-key comeback against small scale opposition. Mason's promoters have other ideas and generate public interest in a real Dixon versus Balboa exhibition match in fight capital Las Vegas. Rocky, against the advice of his son and Paulie can't resist. Determined to prove the last thing a fighter loses is his heart and anxious to get the demons out of his system, Rocky signs the fight contract. Out comes the famous grey tracksuit as Balboa embarks on a punishing training regime. <br /> <br />But this movie provides far more than just a pugilistic punch. It's about life's hard knocks, relationships, death, growing old and letting go of the past. Rocky has a new woman in his life, little Marie from the old neighbourhood, played by Geraldine Hughes. In the original Rocky, Marie was a lost and abusive teenager whom Rocky tried to help. Marie, now a single mother with a child of her own is re-united with Rocky. The dialogue in this film effortlessly fluctuates from hard-hitting to humorous. A movie which is simplistic yet intelligent. Proving that a film can entertain without special effects or complicated twists in the plot. Bill Conti's musical score is inspiring as always and the casting quite magnificent. Many of us grew up with the Rocky character, he has something of an iconic status. The working class underdog who achieves the american dream against seemingly insurmountable odds. It's easy to scoff at the idea of Balboa climbing back through the ropes but it's really no more ludicrous than George Foreman and Larry Holmes staging comeback's as over-weight grandfathers. Foreman actually regained the world championship during his second time around. <br /> <br />Despite Balboa's age, Rocky 6 is perversely more realistic than Rocky 4 and 5. The role of Dixon is played by former light-heavyweight champion of the world Antonio Tarver. Tarver's ring credentials lend an invaluable authenticity to the film and indeed the actual bout against Rocky itself. Stallone also respectfully pays homage to the earlier films. Wonderful to once again witness Balboa running up those famous steps in Philadelphia. Also a pleasure to see Burt Young (Paulie) and Tony Burton (Duke) back on the big screen. My one criticism would be that Duke (Rocky's trainer) has too small a part in the movie. However, Sylvester Stallone has certainly done justice to the Rocky legacy with this final farewell. He can now hang up his gloves as the undisputed champion of boxing movies. 'Rocky Balboa' is a writing, directing and acting knock-out. \\"Yo Adrian, we did it\\". <br />
B000MNP2KI|3.0|Daniel Craig is a terrific actor, and his Bond has some of the hard edge of Sean Connery's. But the world that spawned James Bond is gone, and that undermines this film. Like so many contemporary action films, it goes on and on, piling on the twists - mixing this with therapeutic character interactions (e.g., \\"M\\" advising Bond on how he should regard his girlfriend) that the real Bond would never have tolerated. Bond's casual ruthlessness, his old-fashioned masculinity, is permanently MIA. The book CASINO ROYALE was as simple and potent as a karate chop; the film loses much of that effect. It's often entertaining (especially the clever opening sequence) but it sure ain't DOCTOR NO.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I have been a fan of these guys ever since I first heard \\"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\\" when I worked in a record store and it remains my favorite of their albums, But it is a close tie between the other two. They changed a little bit on \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\" by making it slightly more radio friendly (But not in a bad way) and on this one \\"The Black Parade\\" they expanded on that sound to create a truly inventive and creatively dark experience. The listener is led down a road that alternates between darkness (Dead!) and beauty (I Don't Love You) to paint a unique and catchy portrait of a rock opera. This is hands down one of the best albums of 2006 and perhaps of all time. I haven't stopped listening to it since it came out. People need to stop giving these guys bad reviews, especially those people that admitted they don't even listen to this kind of music.....If you don't listen to it, why are you bothering to review it? Just listen to something else. For those of us that do listen to this kind of music, it doesn't get much better than My Chemical Romance's \\"The Black Parade\\"..Prepare to be amazed and delighted..this is no ordinary emo/punk record. <br /> <br />The best tracks include: The Sharpest Lives. <br />                         I Don't Love You. <br />                         Cancer. <br />                         Disenchanted. <br /> <br />I am going to see these guys live in three weeks and I can't wait, it's going to be amazing.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This is your typical James Bond film.  It has plenty of action, sexy woman, fast cars and exotic places.  So what's wrong with the film?  For me, Daniel Craig doesn't quite do it for me as James Bond.  I will admit I didn't like him at all when I saw the film at the theater but when I watched the DVD I felt much better about him.  He definitely gets more beat up than his predecessors.  Judi Dench plays \\"M\\" and does a good job as she has in her previous Bond films.  I gave it 4 out of 5 because I'm not quite ready to accept Craig as Bond yet.  Still a very exciting film to watch.  If you collect Bond, then you'll want this one.
B000002MP2|5.0|This album is the reason there are so many Pop/Punk bands around today, In my oppinion. Green Day were rocking out long before there was a Blink-182 or Simple Plan. \\"Dookie\\" is often considered to be one of the best albums of the early nineties and it's easy to understand why. This album is loaded with catchy, sing-a-long type songs and an unmatched musical energy. If you are a rock fan you've most likely found yourself flipping through the car radio, looking for something and landing on a Green Day song and whether or not you'll admit it, you soon found yourself singing along to it as you drove. This is the band that started it all for Pop/Punk and this is the record they did it with. \\"Dookie\\" is an absolute essential for any rock fan's collection.....If you don't have it in yours..GET IT!!!!
0790742780|4.0|In life we set our course and we put one foot in front of the other and we start along that chosen path.  Every so often something comes along and pushes us one way or the other and we fight to remain on the path we've chosen.  We hold on with tenacity, with hope and sometimes through sheer faith that everything will turn out like it's supposed to.<br /><br />Michael Douglas does a fantastic job of playing the part of a man who is sort of yanked from his path, then as he tries to pretend that nothing has changed is given the final push towards oblivion.  His actions seem to be those of a psychotic, but the end result, which he outlines for Robert Duvall at the end of the film, sadly, makes sense.<br /><br />He realizes his path is gone, he realizes he is too broken to fix, but some good can still come from his lack of usefullness.<br /><br />He does what we all fear doing while following that path we set for ourselves in life.  He falls down and doesn't have it in himself to get back up.
B000MR1V22|5.0|The title of this movie almost made me steer clear, It has \\"Chick Flick\\" written all over it. But I heard so many possitive reviews of it that I decided to give it a try. This is no chick flick.....It's a touching and somewhat disturbing story thrown together with a huge amount of laughs. I really enjoyed this movie. It is about a disfunctional family, each of which is dealing with their own personal problems. You have the father (Greg Kinnear) who works too much and the mother (Toni Collette) who is starting to lose interest in the marriage because of it, Then you have the gay suicidal uncle (Steve Carell) who tries to kill himself after the man he loves rejects the feelings. Then there is the mute, rebellious brother (Paul Dano), The foul mouthed grandfather (Alan Arkin) and finally the little sister (Abigail Breslin). This is part road trip comedy and part disfuncional family drama. It's about the family getting into their old volkswagon bus and heading out from new mexico to california for the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in which the little girl is a contestant. The ultimate idea behind this movie was this...they had their problems, things got in their way, but they realized that if they stick together as a family they can overcome the odds, all the while learning more about themselves in the process. I would recommend this movie to anyone that's sick of all these teen comedies and bathroom humor and just wants a good, clean laugh. If I could give this film ten stars I would...definately.
B000060OFT|5.0|The trailer parks and custom hot rods notwithstanding, this movie features some of the best acting I've seen in quite some time.  I've read the book many time and have never felt closer to the characters than I did with this production.<br /><br />I wanted to hang out with Benvolio and Mercutio, I wanted to ride with Romeo and watch his love for Juliet grow into a montrous thing that would take both their lives.  I wanted to hate and fight Tybalt and the rest of the Capulet boys but at the same time understood their thought that Romeo's appearance at the party was an affront to them.<br /><br />In all I wanted to be in every scene and feel every word, and because of the production quality and the strength of the cast I was able to do that.  This is one of the few movies to make onto my Ipod so I can always have it with me.  If working, I listen, if bored I watch but always, always, it's there.  Kudos to Leonardi DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo and all the rest who truly brought to life this classic tale of woe.
B00005MP58|5.0|Absolute BEST 'Pride and Prejudice'. Not much more to be said. I have not seen a version that compares.
B000N6U0DS|5.0|I didn't get to see the Pursuit of Happyness at the movie so I bought it the first day it came out on video. I think Wil Smith demonstrated how great an actor he really is in this movie. The dept of emotion he conveyed throughout this story truly touched my heart. It would have been nice to see what happened to the wife and a little more about Chris Gardener after he started his career at Dean Witter. But I think those involved in the story wanted to show the bond between a father and son which they did.  <br />Kudos to Wil Smith and Chris Gardener for telling this life-story. <br />If you haven't seen this movie, it's not too late. It is a very inspirational story. See it.
0743454537|4.0|A standard Jodi Picoult rollercoaster.  The story was interesting - though difficult to relate to, and not necessarily factual.  The pace is good, and I found myself turning pages rapidly - as I do with most of Picoult's works. <br />I found the end dissatisfying, and know others feel the same, but if you like Picoult this is still worth picking up.
B000KGGLCU|4.0|Very nice and excellent dvd. The  shipping for this item also very fast even though I m from Asian. There\\"s only one thing. The dvd cover is very simple. But it doesnt mean I didnt like it. All my friends also enjoy and like it. They also want to have this dvd.  <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|This is a masterpiece of art. If you really don't feel this than your taste buds are roasted. There is nothing close to this. Nothing so save your agruements. Listen to it over and over you might grow your buds back. This is all fact by the way. For fully developed brains only.
B000LXH0AE|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell. I also adore the work of Emma Thompson. To pair these two together had the potential to create one of the best comedies ever. Sadly, the writing on this flick was less than comedic. Will Ferrell's comic timing was dead on, and Maggie Gyllenhaal's appearance as his would-be love interest was perhaps the single most believable aspect of this movie, due to spectacular onscreen chemistry. The story, however, failed to deliver all that it promised in the previews. It's sad when the only funny moments in a comedy are those presented in the 30 second commercial advertising its release, but that is the case with this movie. As a writer, I had such high hopes for this flick. It was an interesting concept which flopped big time in the hands of a writer that stopped with the conception of the idea rather than seeing it through to development.
032147404X|5.0|This book is easy to read and is plastered with the author's dry but witty humor. The author's humor coupled with the light-hearted down-to-earth approach make this book very amusing and easy to read.<br /><br />The book does not cover the technical aspects of photography, such as aperture, ISO and shutter speed setting in grand detail - which the author pointed out is not the goal of this book.<br /><br />Think of this book as a personal companion or a quick reference guide filled with scene-specific techniques on how, what, where and when to shoot in different situations. Not only does the book answer the previous sets of what/where/when/how questions, but also the why. For example, why shoot a photograph of a flower on your knees instead of standing up? Why diffused lighting works best for floral shots and why you should include a foreground, a middleground and a background in landscape photography. Kelby makes seemingly general techniques that once seem mundane to the average photographer/photo-viewer now an indespenable tool of the trade.<br /><br />The author's chapter on photo gear recommendation near the beginning of the book is also a plus for beginning photographers. Although this book is geared toward D-SLR users, the techniques employed can also be used for point-and-shoot compact users as well. Remember, this book's main objective lies in the techniques of digital photography and its compositions, not the techinical configuration of a camera.<br /><br />All in all, this book is one of the few photography books that deserve a spot in my photography library collection.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|First of all, this album is worth the trouble i just went to. <br /> <br />I, like many of you, hate the fact that my itunes won't import this album due to copyright protection. What I found though is that if i allow it to copy to my computer through the designed copyright program and import the copied files in Windows Media Player, I can then burn a new copy on a blank cd-r. Once i have a cd-r copy of the album, i then pop it back into the computer and import the cd-r. It rips without the copy protection crap. My itunes picked it up and imported it fine and I am a happy customer. <br /> <br />The only thing i regret is that i had to make a copy of something i own but it was worth the trouble to get it on my itunes with the other Foo Fighters albums. Go Ahead, Try it if you want the album.
0553588486|4.0|Though a ponderous read and slow moving at times, this book kept me engrossed throughout.  By the end, I wanted to keep reading - always a good sign for any book.  However, I felt both satisifed and queasy, like I'd eaten five big Macs in a row.  Looking back on the story with its human sacrifice, incest, murder, rape, degradation, and plain old human misery and suffering, I'm not sure I want to keep reading despite the excellence of Mr. Martin's writing and story telling!
0805066691|5.0|I was really surprised by this book. I had expected to read nothing but senseless slaughter, but what I really read was the story of battles, most of which were fought valiantly by native peoples. Obviously, history is nothing like in the movies. There were a few cases of outright carnage, but the worst was done on paper through trickery. It was not a story of outright despair: I was uplifted by the honesty, tenacity and intelligence of the natives.<br /><br />I hope that somehow their spirit is integrated into the American culture. We would do well to remember Black Kettle, and forget about Custer.

0743289684|4.0|This is an autobiography with historical significance, which provides a glimpse into life in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya. The author's life is laid bare even to the point of discussion of sexual restrictions physically imposed in the name of religion. A vivid description is given of hardships of living in Somalia around the time of its civil war.  The author, Ayaan Hirsi Ali grew up to become very disenchanted with the life of women in the Muslim world and devoted her life to exposing the hardships they faced. <br /> <br />A key turning point in her life was her refusal to live with the man her father selected for her and to whom he accomplished her marriage without her presence.  She became a refugee in The Netherlands and involved herself in the integration of Muslims into the Dutch community.  She continued to be outspoken against Muslims particularly with their treatment of women and became the target of their anger.  After becoming a member of the parliament of The Netherlands with greater public exposure, her life was threatened and she spent a great deal of time in hiding in the United States and other places. <br /> <br />Following the 9/11 attacks, she turned from the Islam religion.  She did not turn to another religion such as Christianity, but resolved to forget about the \\"hereafter\\" and only concentrate on meeting some of the goals of religion in her daily life. <br />
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Rod Stewart, apart to be a living legend on stages through over three decades and a half, , is a singer who has known to reinvent himself over and over. This successful idea, so desired for many others singers have found in his original voice, the perfect instrument to bring us back to all these vanished memories,<br /><br />Unforgettable melodies that found the widest resonance in the decade of the forties, fifties and sixties.<br /><br />Supported by a fabulous big leaguer musical team, Stewart has know to sharp every song he sung, with adequate emotion, accuracy and commitment. The result of this initial experiment has been materialized until this date in four extraordinary registers.<br /><br />In what concerns this special album the result has been particularly gratifying. The achieved maturity has been reached until the last consequences. He is a crooner of a huge charisma and extraordinary melodic vein, reason which this CD has figured so many weeks in enviable ranking sellers as one the most fortunate since its release the last year.<br /><br />Under any circumstance you should miss this fabulous compilation, that somehow complements decades that will never get back but that certainly feed and flamed the romantic imagination and were motives of special and pleasant attention for many couples around the world that nowadays are grandfathers or even great grand fathers.
0385336691|4.0|I really enjoy the work of Lee Child.  If you enjoy pure escapist entertainment, he is easily one of the best thriller writers out there.  THE HARD WAY is the tenth in his highly successful series about ex-military investigator Jack Reacher.<br /><br />Most of the Reacher novels focus on non-stop action.  THE HARD WAY is a bit different, and is more of a detective story.  A man's wife is kidnapped, and Reacher is enlisted to investigate the crime.  I thought Child did a very good job setting up the story, although I must admit I found the big plot twist at the end of the novel to be very predictable.  Still, THE HARD WAY is a lot of fun, and Child is an real expert at plotting a novel so that you can't stop turning the pages.<br /><br />Keep in mind that Child's stories are not exactly realistic.  Coincidence plays a large role in every Reacher novel, and the characters in THE HARD WAY are far from nuanced.  The villain in this story, for example, is so thoroughly despicable that I didn't find him particularly believable.  But that's okay -- Child is aiming for escapist fun here, not hard-core realism.<br /><br />You can read the Reacher novels in any order, because he is the only recurring character in the books.  Still, my personal favorite of the series is KILLING FLOOR, the first book.  So I would strongly recommend starting with that novel if you haven't read it already.
B000OVLNII|1.0|I was very disappointed, although it was a great book to put this reader to sleep at night .. and quickly.
0316010669|5.0|This is the author of \\"The Tipping Point\\" and Blink is about how we make choices, decisions, impressions in a blink of an eye with some doing it very well and others not so well. How some people can go with their \\"instincts and win while others stumble into error\\". Gladwell tosses on it head the notion about waiting to get all of the information necessary, making analysis before making decisions. Whether one is looking at great or fake art, the reasons why \\"New Coke\\" failed miserably or why police make split-second decisions that can be horribly wrong or predicting a professional tennis serve in or out or whether a marriage would succeed or fail was fascinating.<br /><br />Gladwell writes of a concept called, `thin-slicing' or `the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience.' Whether one is concerned about marriage, suing a doctor, marketing, speed dating, taste tests, electing a president, pop music or `listening with your eyes', this book is fascinating and has a lot to say to us about our decisions, our context, our environment, our experience and how we process information in a moment, make impressions and make decisions.<br /><br />This book will change the way you.......
B000NA28IE|1.0|I was completely unprepared for just how bad this movie was. I believe it is the first time a movie has made me want to NOT read the book. If the dialogue was taken ver batim from the book then woe betide the poor reader who has to wallow through such grisly tripe.<br /><br />As for the story line....think of every fantasy you've ever read....now put it in a blender and hit puree. The story is a cliche even of itself.<br /><br />Let's cover the acting...ok on second thought let's not...except to say that Malchovich hit the melodramatic \\"high C\\".<br /><br />Finally my children both fell asleep watching this movie, and they were the one's responsible for putting it in the DVD player to begin with. I shan't forgive them anytime soon.
B000EXZI28|5.0|I feel that this is one of the best albums the Bee Gees ever did. Sure, it has a few weak spots, as all of their albums do, but overall it's the album some of us always wished and knew they could do. The orchestration is toned down or non-existent as opposed to almost everything in the first phase of their career and the disco tendencies are almost completely gone as well. These are outstanding pop songs in the tradition of the Beatles--great harmonies, inventive arrangements. Nobody planned Maurice's departure but if they had planned to close up shop altogether, this would serve as a very fitting finale and shows what these fellows were capable of doing when they wanted. Of course, this is only a subjective reflection of my tastes. Others may prefer the disco Bee Gees or the ballad Bee Gees. This just happens to include many songs in styles that I prefer personally.
0393327655|5.0|If you are a reasonable person, or even think of yourself as a reasonable person, this book is for you.  It documents the problems with religion as a whole, as well as specifics against popular religion.  This book also speaks to the hopefully reparable harm that religion has caused in America's politics.  If you are truly faithful to any religious belief, it is definitely a must-read.  Some of it may upset you, but the rest of it will help you effectively balance your religious beliefs with modern society.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|It is the film that should have won Best Picture from the Academy. That's besides the point, though. This film, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", is now 'locked' into the American landscape as not only one of the best films of all time, but one of the most important. The Two- Disc Collector's Edition only re- confirms the majesty and brilliance of Ang Lee's direction and deserved Best Directors Award from the Academy. One cannot resist being pulled into this film and being apart of these two men's struggle. The first 'male sex' experience for Ennis in the tent is raw, intense, shocking and beautiful all at the same time. You are left speechless and your heart pounding. The first kiss between Jack and Ennis is tender, gentle and sensual... both are capable of loving. Hollywood has always chickened out in following through from here. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" does not. I believe this film will soon go down in the American history books as a vital and all- out important work and contribution to art, film and literature, alike.
B0002KVUL6|5.0|This movie is fantastic!! It pays homage to the great monster movies of the Golden Age. All the horror films of today have sunk to mindless gorefests instead of making you think. The Ultimate collector's edition is even better since it includes the original classis's Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf man. Ignore all the nay sayers and get this set, just pop it into your DVD player and enjoy!!
B000N3T0DW|2.0|I admit that my expectations were totally wrong concerning this film. I was expecting a Spanish reworking of Noel Coward's famous play about the dead returning to humorously haunt the living. The advertising for Volver in the local media certainly led me to have this expectation. Maybe this is why I found this film to be so perplexing and disappointing. But even on it's own terms I found Volver a difficult movie to enjoy. Others see a celebration of strong women. I see a movie about murder, incest, deceit and theft. Every main character here is a criminal. Raimunda, her mother, her daughter, all commit one crime or another, some truly monstrous. Who is there to admire? This is empowerment? I'm trying to avoid spoilers here but suffice to say there is not one truly likable character in this whole film. <br /> <br />Aside from the overall unpleasantness of the movie a director as experienced as Almodovar should have produced a tighter work than this. There are numerous loose plot threads here. The whole subplot concerning the Jerry Springer-like tv show didn't really make any sense. The restaurant owner seems to like Raimunda but nothing comes of this. In fact the whole restaurant subplot just peters out, with no resolution. When the movie ended my first thought was \\"What, that's it? It's over?\\". People might say \\"Well, life has loose ends\\" but this is a movie, not life. It should have an ending.  <br /> <br />I know I'm definitely in the minority concerning Volver. My wife thinks I'm nuts for not liking this film but I really think the emperor has no clothes here.
078322947X|5.0|Never saw &#34;Wages of Fear&#34; but &#34;Sorcerer&#34; is definitely a weird creepy movie due to the score from Tangerine Dream. Notable credit must be given to Keith Barret who supplied some nice mood music during a great panaglide helicopter shot overlooking the oil fire in the movie. Great jungle locations...something about jungle movies creep me out  (Romancing the Stone comes to mind). Excellent scenes of suspense involving the trucks transporting nitroglycerine through the rugged jungle country. Steve McQueen was considered first for the role that Roy Scheider would eventually play. Mcqueen would have been fine for the role and it would have definitely been a different movie although maybe not for the better. Roy Scheider brings an element of believeability and succeeds on all levels...Im glad he was cast and not McQueen. Anyway, pure suspense, creepy music, weird locations and the great idea of putting 4 strangers in a dangerous situation make &#34;Sorcerer&#34; a winner in my book.
B000J103PC|4.0|THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA features the fabulous Meryl Streep in her most cattily-comedic performance since \\"Death Becomes Her\\".  She plays Miranda Priestly, the revered and feared editor-in-chief of Runway, the most popular fashion magazine on the planet.<br /><br />When an idealistic writer named Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway, \\"The Princess Diaries\\", \\"Becoming Jane\\") becomes employed as Miranda's new assistant, she soon finds herself playing gumshoe to Miranda's impossible requests, and fending off her hurtful insults.  But along the way, Andy gains in confidence and style, and proves herself more than a match when the going gets rough.<br /><br />Streep and Hathaway square off hilariously in this great film.  The supporting cast is led by Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci.  The film was based on Lauren Weisberger's novel of the same name, and reportedly inspired by Vogue Magazine's legendary editor, Anna Wintour.<br /><br />The DVD includes director's commentary, deleted scenes, several Making-Of featurettes, and the trailer.
6305546789|5.0|Halloween is the creme della creme of horror movies. Everything about this movie is fantastic; the camera angles ( The POV shots and the wide panaglide shots); the evil shape or blank slate known as Michael Myers;the superb cast, and of course the music. Without a doubt, John Carpenter revolutionized the horror film genre not only with his stylish direction and photography but with his synth score. Forget GOBLIN, forget TANGERINE DREAM. Those guys were around before Carpenter and couldnt raise the bar...John Carpenter did. He borrowed ideas from european horror films and made them his own and did a much better job. EVERY horror film following HALLOWEEN had to have a synth score. John Carpenter is a master storyteller and musician. His talent outshines all of his peers.
B000NA28IE|1.0|I have read this book and part of Eldest, the sequel, and the only reason I understood the movie was becuase I had read the books. The acting was pretty good and it was actually a good film for children who aren't allowed to whatch gory moveis. The goriest part of the movie was when a carchter inserted his poisened fingernail into sombody's body, and another character's forehead. To sum it up it was a movie going a mile a minute and not explaining well
B000IMUYJM|2.0|BLACK CHRISTMAS is not as effective as HALLOWEEN. The killer is annoying, some gurgling lunatic who uses obscene language to get his point across. The direction and editing is weak. How many times do we have to see the woman wrapped in cellophane up in the attic...she's dead ..I get it...Move on! I wasnt routing for the characters or the killer for that matter...this movie just didnt deliver. HALLOWEEN and WHEN A STRANGER CALLS \\"borrowed\\" from this film and both movies were scarier!

B00005JPCF|1.0|I saw this movie yesterday at my brother's house, one of my nieces and my sister in law thought it was a great movie.  To borrow from the Ferris Buehler movie, \\"I weep for the future.\\"  Most of the penguins look pretty much the same so how to tell them apart?  Make one Marilyn Monroe and give the rest ethnic accents.  There's russian, jewish, jamaican, scottish, hispanic, etc.  And then there are the covers of decent songs, re-done for the generation that thinks America Idol is good TV.  Morals aside this was just a rip-off of culture to make a lot of cash.  And guess what?  I just saw the preview of the next penguin movie, this time they go surfing.  Just like Fonzie!
B000KX0IOA|5.0|If only some of our world \\" leaders \\" were like this ! Seriously a film I think everyone should see before they become an adult or get idea's in their heads that they know what's going on in this world. The acting and cast are superb and the content well thought out and factual. Never boring and does make one think of some of the exceptional people who have walked this planet. If you you like war and fast action rent another movie, if you want a serious movie that you can enjoy this is it.
B00005JPCF|2.0|Despite the title, this is NOT a happy movie. It has very little laughter or joy, and it didn't leave me feeling happy. There are so many ways in which it is bad that I'm really surprised to read the positive reviews here on Amazon. And did it win an Oscar? Unbelievable! <br /> <br />First the good stuff: the animation is amazing, if you understand that they were going for realism and not cute. Both \\"Cars\\" and \\"Happy Feet\\" are animated movies, but it's quite a stretch to use the same term for both of them because their styles are so different.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, that's it for the good stuff. Here's a list of some of the bad stuff, some of which I didn't see mentioned in some other reviews: <br /> <br />+ That super-realistic animation has a negative side. It doesn't work to put \\"people\\" personalities in realistic animals when the animals do very unhuman things, like feeding their young by regurgitating fish into their open beaks. That kind of thing is fine if they are just animals, but it backfires when the producers are trying to get us to relate to their people-like personalities. <br /> <br />+ The super-realistic animation has another problem: how do you let the audience know which Emperor penguin is Mumble when they all look almost exactly the same? So they gave Mumble blue eyes and had him keep half his downy fuzz far longer than any of the other penguins that were hatched when he was. Sure, I realize why they had to do that, but it conflicts with the realistic presentation of all the other animals. <br /> <br />+ The movie is way too long for the content. The few fun scenes didn't make up for the overall slow and dragging pace.  <br /> <br />+ The message is way too heavy-handed. Really. I can be generous and assume that the writers and producers thought that the \\"save the food chain\\" message was too important to try for subtlety, but the weighty message really conflicted with the occasional times when the movie tried to be cute or funny. Were theytrying to entertain us or whack us over the head? It really didn't work to try to do both. <br /> <br />+ The songs seemed to have all been picked with the primary purpose of producing a mild chuckle from the adult audience because of the situations in which each song is sung. They get no points for originality, and there's no attempt to explain how the penguins would know \\"alien\\" songs. Once again, are we supposed to think that they're penguins or humans in little tuxedos? <br /> <br />+ On a related note, the penguins always sing with musical accompaniment (including percussion) that seemingly comes from nowhere, but they can't seem to grasp what Mumble is doing with his tapping feet. It's a glaring inconsistency that the penguin's can't seem to recognize rhythm in their own \\"heartsongs\\" while they persecute Mumble for having rhythm. <br /> <br />+ Mumble gets rejected by the other penguins because he can't sing. And he gets rejected again. And again. And again. Please give us a break -- we get the point.  <br /> <br />+ Lots of other reviewers have commented on the obvious sexual content of several scenes. There is nothing clever or subtle here, and nothing as fancy as a double-entendre. The dialog and the words of several songs have very explicit intent. Not vulgar, but I was surprised by how explicit it was. Is this a kids movie? Is it an adult movie? I really couldn't figure out who the intended audience was. <br /> <br />+ Several other reviewers also mentioned the scary scenes. The leopard seal especially was really scary. I guess this isn't a kids movie. And that scene ends with the seal saying something like \\"I know where you live\\" foreshadowing that we would see him again, but (thankfully) that never happens.  <br /> <br />+ I could go on, but I'll just mention one last point that really puzzled me. Of all the animals in the world, why did they pick a penguin for tap dancing? Penguins have very short legs, plus they have feathers and/or down that pretty much covers their feet. So you really can't see much at all when Mumble is doing his thing. Unlike some other reviewers, I have no doubt that Mumble's feet were perfectly in sync with the sound track of recorded tapping, but a penguin was the wrong animal to try to show that. A flamingo or a stork would have made sense, but why pick a bird whose feet are mostly hidden?? <br />
B000I5YCCO|4.0|The true appeal of Taylor Swift's debut is her nuanced performances of good songs.  She doesn't possess the best or strongest voice in country music, but she knows how to place the right emotion into her voice.  \\"Tim McGraw\\" drips of sadness and heartbreak, \\"Picture to Burn\\" and \\"Should've said No\\" are on fire with her anger, there's laughter in \\"Our Song,\\" and wistful longing in \\"Teardrops on my guitar\\" and \\"Stay Beautiful.\\"   <br />Not every song is a homerun.  \\"The Outside\\" and \\"Mary's Song\\" are very generic, and Taylor herself seems puzzled by which emotion she wants to invoke.  Additionally, Swift spends most of the album sounding worried or sad; I'm hoping her next offering shows a bit more of her happiness. <br />The album and Swift's vocals are enormously helped by the understated production and light touch with background vocals, which always compliments Swift's voice without overpowering or crowding her out.  Additionally, Swift's well on her way to becoming a major force in country music songwriting if this album is any indication.  Most songs are well-put together and catchy. <br />I'm enjoying this album and looking forward to what Taylor Swift has to offer next. <br />Favorites: Tim McGraw, Teardrops on my guitar, Tied together with a smile, Should've said no, Our song
0385486804|5.0|I really didn't know how to feel after I read this book.  I felt both irritation at this kids innocent idealism as well as a goodly amount of respect for what he wanted to do and his insistance on doing it his way.  the book is a great investigative memoir, retracing the steps of a young man trying to find his way.  A great read and a VERY unique story.  Truth can be stranger than fiction.

0316010669|4.0|This book has a very interesting opening that will draw you into the theories and ideas that make this book a great read. It doesn't preach and it isn't too intellectual. It gives examples on how sometimes, our first thought is the best one, and that maybe, just maybe we are designed that way.
B000002J1F|5.0|I became enamored with this record nearly 35 years ago and I literally wore out my first copy and had to buy a second. It should go without saying that this is one of THE MOST important recordings of the prog-rock genre and it may very well be Yes' best record. No other Yes album features such tight grooves and unison lines played at dizzying speeds. Fragile is prog rock's answer to jazz-fusion snobs who claim that the genre lacks virtuosic musicianship.  <br /> <br />As GREAT, and unprecedented, as this album may be it does suffer from some serious flaws that without them would have made this album even better! <br /> <br />The small pieces showcasing the individual artist's solo work and classical interpretation and/or composition are superfluous. These were probably included to show critics and fans that Yes were SERIOUS musicians; or to help sell subsequent solo efforts. Well, whatever the case, they didn't have to do any of that to prove to anyone with two good ears that they were the real deal! Their egos got the best of them and they littered an otherwise PERFECT recording with unnecessary doodling. What a shame. This is not to say that Mood for a Day is bad; it's great and IMO the only solo piece that merits any space on this record(I'm an ardent RW fan, but the Cans And Brahms piece is ridiculous). <br /> <br />That being said, if I had been the producer of this record(ah, Mr. Eddie Offord, please let me fantasize for a few minutes, will ya?!) I would have taken all of the smaller, individual ideas from the ego massaging pieces and used them to extend Long Distance Runaround to the 8-12 minute mark. The track really grooves with Steve's quasi-jazz guitar and the tight rhythm section put down by Chris and Bill. It's a solid piece, no doubt, but way under-developed. LDR could have easily been extended to include solos by each member, hence satisfying their individual thirst for the limelight.   <br /> <br />There are, in essence, five meaningful pieces on this record(including MFAD). If the record would have kept to these five(with an extension of LDR), IMO, Fragile would have been the crowning glory of prog rock and may be considered the very best the genre has to offer. <br /> <br />----------------------------------- <br />If I would have produced the record: <br />----------------------------------- <br /> <br />1. Roundabout (8:29)   <br />2. South Side Of The Sky (8:04)  <br />3. Long Distance Runaround (3:33) &lt;---extended to 8-12 minutes <br />4. Mood For A Day (3:57)&lt;---- Not essential for a Yes album. <br />   I may have even left this one out. <br />   Steve has solo records and he should <br />   use that space for his solo stuff. <br />5. Heart Of The Sunrise (10:34)  <br /> <br />A note for the bass players out there:  This record features some of the VERY BEST bass playing you will ever hear. Chris Squire rips the Rick to shreds on Fragile! He plays hard, fast and precise...and sweet when called to do so. Amazing, amazing work by Chris!!!
B000HT2P9S|4.0|I originally bought this book for my husband, who decided he didn't want to read it (isn't that always the way?) so I did.  I never had heard of this author and had no pre-concieved judgements about what I might find. And I was pleased at the interesting set up!  This is really an interesting book about the nature of religion.  What happens when everybody stops believeing in a God?  makes you think.  Warning!  I am a dork, so perhaps that may have something to do with my enjoyment.
0812975219|3.0|This book could have been great, but I found it very difficult to read at some points. It was written for academics. Having said that, it is definitely worth it, because the lessons that you can learn about probability and risk are amazing.

B00004XPPK|5.0|\\"Gilda\\" was Rita Hayworth's vehicle to  cinematic immortality. She plays the  Grande Dame of Femme Fatale; the seductive  High Priestess of all bad girls and  Women of the world.  Blatant voyeurism  is more than justified when it comes to   reasons for watching this film. Hayworth is   perfect and she strolls through this movie  with the confidence and sex appeal of a   super model down a runway.    The plot is no disappointment, either. Johnny Farrell (Glen Ford)  wears multiple hats: first, Gilda's \\"chaperone/protector,\\"  and later, her husband. In between, Gilda makes  life hell for Johnny (the man who wronged her way back when)  by leading a care-free life of hedonism;  at Johnny's emotional expense, no less. The two are later married  after Ballin Mundson (Gilda's husband and Johnny's boss) fakes his  death to escape the law.  Johnny inflicts emotional anguish on  Gilda by restricting her freedom. Gilda rebels and runs away. Her  famous \\"Put the Blame on Mame\\" striptrease is her classic  statement of rebellion. From there, more clever twists  and turns finally result in Gilda and Johnny finally recognizing  their true love for each other.    Don't think twice; get this movie. It's guaranteed enjoyment  for any fan of Hollywood's silver screen era. It's also  a \\"must-buy\\" for Rita Hayworth fans.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret by Rhonda Byrne is a wonderful compilation of information that has been available. I picked up a book 35 years ago illustrated by Peter Max that was titled \\"THOUGHT.\\" It was the sayings of a Vedic sage and said in 20 small pages everything that  \\"The Secret by Rhonda Byrne\\" says in 10 times as many pages. <br />Nonetheless, \\"The Secret by Rhonda Byrne\\" is an excellent presentation of the same concepts and how to apply them in daily life.
B000002MJ0|4.0|As the quiet before the storm, or the alchemist for \\"My Bloody Valentine's\\" zenith album Loveless-- which was a benchmark that culminated the modern shoegaze/dream-pop genre--Isn't Anything is more mainstream (you can actually hear most of the vocals here) but is no less sexual, and trancelike, utilizing dreamy and almost tangible soundscapes that make it seem like you can actually sink your teeth into their sonics.  Many of the nation's current youth might actually like this better than Loveless, as the approach to the material is more \\"Sonic Youth\\" by way of \\"Joy Division,\\" less \\"Cocteau Twins\\" by way of \\"The Jesus and Mary Chain,\\" and is an incredible album showcasing Kevin Shields as possibly the best guitarist/musical composer to get a start in the late 1980's.    Started with the sensual track, Soft as Snow (But Warm Inside), with Shields clear vocals, and alluring lyrics, and Blinda Butcher's soothing, lush, and lustful backing voice; mixing to create a warm `n fuzzy sensation down there, and engorging the listener with hormonal intuition. \\"My Bloody Valentine\\" is hot n' saucy, showcasing a come-hither flirtation, and giving the listener a heartening mood with such excerpts like, \\"Soft as velvet eyes can see, bringing me close to ecstasy:\\" that blisters into a blazing and crusading instrument solo that spirals into some fuzz tone, and Butcher's \\"ohhing\\"-backing chime to bring the song to its final conclusion. Then moving into the track, Lose My Breath, a delicate mood piece of beauty, with an airy subtleness, making it tantalizing, and despite its seemingly skimpy backbeats and languid feel, it's still never futile. Then shortly later, the hard-rocking,  When you Wake (Your Still In a Dream,) shows that they are a band that never gets into shambolic lengthy babble; rather its predetermined entropy.    All I Need is the least interesting and unmemorable spot on the album, at least when propped up to their other tracks,  that also contain this backing \\"ohhing\\"and that off center vocal, yet is gladly remedied with Feed Me With Your Kiss, and its grueling instrument line, giving the listener a hurtling frenzy of kinky sex; while, Sueisfine, has this hard-rockin' edge, and features one of the most brilliant lyric tweaks, from the chorus that changes from \\"Sue-is-fine\\" into \\"Su-i-cide,\\" a true change of mood into bleaker darklands. Or take the wispy, Several Girls Galore,  the poetic and subtler, No More Sorry, and, You Never Should, as well as the concluding waves of noise in, Nothing Much to Lose, and I Can See It (But I Can't Feel It,) all seeming like \\"My Bloody Valentine\\" is dropping bombs of musical ingenuity into the  audiences eardrums to get them to no know what good musical noise is made of: thus bringing this album of sexuality to a close, and creating a memorable and nerve-pleasuring experience.    **** ½ (Out of 5)
B000G8NXYG|5.0|I've seen this film about 6 times and never get tired of it.  Only this time I'm going to buy it and add to my library.  This is truly a classic.  Jerry K. \\"JFK\\"
B000NA28IE|2.0|And to sayI was sick would be an understatement. I love the books, and this movie was a travesty. In that bare thirty minutes, I realised just how much of the story got chopped for the sake of Hollywood. Too much John Makovich by far. It's not that I think he's a terrible actor, I really don't. But Galbatorix was not featured. Was it part of his contract or something that he had to have more than three lines or something? <br /> <br />Taking movies for what they are, entertainment, I still wasn't entertained, not even by the decent graphics. Some people really try to quash them, but they were decent. I really tried to get into this movie, and was very sad to see Hollywood trashing yet another really good book for the sake of money and time. My father watched it through to the end and was saddened by this movie as well. Dwarves? There were no dwarves! <br /> <br />The acting was all right, the graphics decent and Jeremy Irons is the only reason this movie doesn't get one star from me. He seemed to really get into the role of Brom. <br /> <br />I would rather have seen this done as a series of CG works than this piece of el-crappo. This almost ranks up there with the tragedy they turned Harry Potter 3 & 4 into... It's a close call... <br /> <br />I wonder when Hollywood director prima donnas will learn that there ARE some standards!
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|Obviously, I don't expect everyone to share my opinion here, but when I went to watch the movie I'll admit that I'd read no reviews and didn't know what genre the movie was in.  Usually, if there is a mystery involved the viewer has some sense that there is a mystery to solve.  In this case, however, most of the movie felt like I was watching a poorly told story of a romance between a duchess and a magician.  It wasn't until the mystery was reviled in the last 5 minutes that I understood that there was something to uncover.  As such, I found the movie to be boring and poorly planned for the genre it was in.  The good news is that it wasn't a bad romance movie after all.  Perhaps if I were to watch it for the first time again with my new understanding, I would enjoy it.  As I've already watched it though, I don't want to go back and have to start from the beginning.<br /><br />A quick note on the positive here, I'd not been much of a fan of Jessica Biel's in the past.  When I saw at the beginning of the movie that she was in it, I was a bit disappointed.  However, she did an wonderful job and was so good at portraying her character in the movie it took me some time to realize that she was who I was watching.  Kudos to Jessica on doing such a great job!  All of the acting was good (Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti also being great actors) but Jessica really surprised me.

B000MV8ABS|5.0|Ok, I was 7 when I first saw this and it scared me. With those sphere's flying around and Mike having his hand caught in that box. There are so many memories attached to this film for me. I was glad to see that they FINALLY released Phantasm I and III but what about two and four. Or why not a box set. I do understand why two was not up. Not the same \\"Mike\\" as in the first one. But it is still part of the story. Glad that they did get Baldwin back though. The other guy was a bit weak and confused. All in all, this is one set I plan to get. Can't knock movies that were fun and scarey to watch. True fans know what I mean.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|Once again, as with most movies, the hype for this waste of celluloid far exceeds the reality. I've slept through boring movies before but this movie isn't boring, it's simply terrible. I walked out of the theatre shaking my head. When I'd heard it had been nominated for an Oscar, I was more stunned than when Milli Vanilli (remember those lame lounge 'singers'?) when the Grammy for Best New Artist. <br /> <br />The first - and most basic rule - for a movie to succeed is that the movie must make the viewer suspend belief in reality temporarily to buy into the premise of the film. Little Miss Depressing never makes it out of the starting gate in that aspect. Scene after scene is simply not believable. If one doesn't suspend belief in reality early in a film, each successive scene shows its limitation. Over halfway into the film, when one of the characters dies, is the biggest insult to a moviegoers intelligence. That a family would proceed to a \\"beauty contest\\" for a white trash girl who didn't even finish first in her local pageant instead of making preperations for a family member who died while traveling with them is the epitome of absurdity. <br /> <br />If Hollywood thinks this kind of weak and limited film is what will build the next generation of moviegoers, they are sadly mistaken. On the other hand, perhaps Hollywood understands the stupidity and ignorance of the average American. For people to love Little Miss Idiocy portends a sad future for America.

B000001FO4|5.0|THE BAND: Tom Keifer (vocals, guitars, harmonica), Jeff Labar (guitars), Eric Brittingham (bass), Fred Coury (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1988) 10 tracks clocking in at approximately 44 minutes. Included with the disc is a 4-page foldout containing song titles/credits/times, song lyrics, 2 band photos, and thank you's. Recorded at Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, NY. Additional players included - Cozy Powell (drums), Rick Criniti (synth, piano), Denny Carmassi (drums) and Kurt Shore (keyboards). Label - Mercury Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Though not quite in the same league as Cinderella's '86 debut (\\"Night Songs\\"), this sophomore release is still a great rocker. Where \\"Night Songs\\" was for the most part straight ahead 80's hair/glam rock, this \\"Long Cold Winter\\" continued to rock, but also showed Keifer's love for the blues. Highlights include the opener \\"Bad Seamstress Blues / Falling Apart At The Seams\\"; the piano ballad \\"Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)\\" that coolly reminds me of Motley Crue's \\"Home Sweet Home\\"; the album's first hit \\"Gypsy Road\\"; the slow and melancholy title track; and two minor hits with the mid tempo rocker \\"The Last Mile\\" and the heaviest track on the album \\"If You Don't Like It\\" (in the same vein as their earlier \\"Shake Me\\"). \\"Don't Know What You Got\\" reached #12 on the US charts - and turned out to be the band's biggest hit to date. Two filler songs with \\"Second Wind\\", and \\"Fire And Ice\\". As an album, \\"Long Cold Winter\\" failed to top the #3 \\"Night Songs\\" (reaching #10 in the US) - both albums have sold 3+ million units. One of the hidden gems on this album is \\"Coming Home\\" with it's slow acoustic intro and Keifer singing, well, sounding almost normal... I like his voice here and often wondered what would've happened had he sung more songs like this. The music on this album is varied - fast, slow, bluesy... and a sign of things to come - their 3rd album \\"Heartbreak Station\\" (1990) was very bluesy. If I'm going to grab one Cinderella album, more times than not it will be \\"Night Songs\\", but this \\"Long Cold Winter\\" comes in a close 2nd. A very accomplished record at the time (4.5 stars).la album, more times than not it will be \\"Night Songs\\", but this \\"Long Cold Winter\\" comes in a close 2nd.

B00028HBKC|3.0|Despite the strange character portrayals (Satan, Pilate) and gory violence (possibly the bloodiest movie yet), 'Passion' has many enduring moments. Scenes such as Mary rushing to help her son during his fateful walk to the hill at Golgotha, as well as Christ passing on his duties as son before his death are indeed unforgettable.<br /><br />James Caviezel portrays Christ with riveting authenticity, See for yourself.<br /><br />This movie is gripping and visceral, definitely worth seeing for persons of every faith. Film critics immediately attacked Mel Gibson's portrayal of the Jewish people in this film, setting in motion a massive publicity bonfire that fed the flames of the movie's success. Personally, I felt the presentation of the Jewish people was roughly parallel to that of the New Testament account within the Bible (with the exception of the demon kids, and additional punishment to Christ on his way to trial). The controversy surrounding this picture was immense, Hollywood was outraged but helpless to stop the film's release due mainly to the heavy audience pull and box office power of Mel Gibson(who also wrote,directed and starred in the violent smash-hit Braveheart). Movie-goers were intrigued by the growing controversy as well as Gibson's sudden, and intense faith-based statements. This film was most successful amongst protestant Christians here in the US, Entire churches bought out showings all over the country and helped to push the already controversy-driven box office gross past the $300 million mark. A landmark blockbuster was unleashed, What will Gibson create next?
B00023RZTE|3.0|I got this watch because I love flight watches and I really wanted to get a Breitling but found out it costs more than I thought so I go this instead to satisfy my urge and my wallet.  It looks great and similar to the Navitimer but like ten times less?!  There is another similar watch that Seiko makes that also has the world time, so you might want to get that instead but the extra LCD display kind of ruins the classical face for me.  The only downside to getting this is that there is really cool technology out there by Seiko and Citizen that eliminates the use of the watch battery, basically you never have to change the battery again.  That is really cool as cracking open the watch every year or two cannot be good and not to mention extra costs.  Kudos for you, bad for the watch repair guy.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|This might not be the bands greatest CD(Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Califonication are better) but it nonetheless stands apart as a cd where John Frusciante's guitar work really captures the listener. The solos from Dani California to 21st Century are excellent.  I recommend this to any RHCP fan but do not expect something hard hiting like Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  I can honestly say that when this cd was released in 2006 I did not play guitar, John Frusciante has inspired me to learn.

B000N6TX1I|3.0|My wife and I (in our late 40's) watched this with our two sons (19 and 17).  We had heard good reviews and my son was especially interested as he had heard a lot of talk about it at college.  At the end we were all a bit disappointed.  The cinematography was great, the future scenes horrible but credible, the plot a little difficult but not too hard to follow as described in other reviews preceeding this one. The chaos and destruction of the world other than the refuge of Great Britain was unexplained at the beginning as was the significant group the \\"Human Project\\" that was the destination of the plot.<br /><br />We liked the music, I especially enjoyed and was suprised at the use of \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" from King Crimson and the scenes right off from an old Pink Floyd album cover.  The acting in all parts was good, expecially Michale Caine in his old John Lennon like role.  Clive Owen was a little passive and lacked emotion for all the turmoil that he passed through.  Even if he was acting as trying to survive day by day it came off as too casual.  Some of the scenes especially in the ruined city of refugees were impressive and powerful and made you feel that you had to dodge bullets and run for your life.<br /><br />What was the problem?  At the end we all felt that there was not the resolution we hoped for. I won't ruin it by telling you exactly what happened, see for your self what you think, but it ends with a boat named \\"Tomorrow\\".  I will say that it was difficult to see which side you could feel an allegiance for other than the poor young woman with the first baby in 18 years.  I kept wanting to have a side to cheer or hope for but all seemed dismal, gray and blown apart, each side with it's own significant problems, too like a situation in real life that has no satisfying resolution.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|\\"Reloaded\\" turns out to be a whopping disappointment. I caught the midnight preview of this movie and was expecting a satisfying sequel building from the strengths of the first Matrix film, which was an instant sci-fi/action classic. Instead, we were treated to a terribly botched effort. Apparently, the first film was a fluke for the Wachowskis, whose writing and character building skills simply evaporated after the smash success of the first film. Alongside the likewise awful \\"Matrix: Revolutions\\", the once promising team proceeded to demolish the legacy of what could have been the next \\"Star Wars Trilogy\\". Hence, a potential all-time classic series of Matrix films was not to be. What went wrong?<br /><br />Plenty.<br /><br />For starters, the original characters were not refreshed or developed adequately. We fully expect to see Neo's awesome powers on full display, and here the Wachowskis do not disappoint. However, the Neo character remains virtually the same, his realization that the Oracle's prediction was correct and that he truly is \\"The One\\" failed to boost his confidence or convince him to truly lead his comrades towards victory against the machines ( Imagine Luke Skywalker in \\"Return Of The Jedi\\" still behaving like a whining farm boy). Instead, Neo takes a back seat to Morpheus again. The relationship between Neo and Trinity is still flat, I sensed no on-screen chemistry between the two at any time.<br /><br />The supporting cast have a small degree of development, but it is too little, too late as the movie plods along between killer (if not clich&eacute;) action sequences. Central character Agent Smith is altered into a more powerful \\"Smith\\", OK. This classic villain has been ruined by an awful script long on existential rhetoric but short on captivation. The CGI \\"Squidies\\" are badly overdone here as well as in \\"Revolutions\\". We expect to see more sophisticated and diverse machines introduced, especially in a world of machines such as this. Instead, the squidies are the only muscle the machine empire can produce to combat the Zionites. The program-run-amok characters such as the Merovingian are silly and lame.<br /><br />This movie was a financial blockbuster due mainly to the action sequences, which were superb despite the overdone CGI effects. It's a shame that the excellent storyline introduced in the first movie was thoroughly trashed beginning with this sequel and continuing into the third and (thankfully) final installment.e squidies are the only muscle the machine empire can produce to combat the Zionites.

0393312836|4.0|Unlike most dystopian novels, which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" focuses on the nature of the individual in the future. Our protagonist is Alex, only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal, roving the streets with his band of friends, taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him. The boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless. In fact, the more helpless the victim, it seems, the more pleasure the boys take in the act. The most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes. They aren't doing any of this out of malice toward their targets; in fact, it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim. They are creating mayhem just because it's fun for them.<br /><br />Everything changes, however, when one particular break-in goes horribly awry and Alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder. There, though he manages to create an illusion of good behavior, we see that the experience has no real impression on his sense of morality. Then, after two years, he is chosen for a new, experimental rehabilitation program, designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in, or even contemplate, any acts of violence. As we see, however, this \\"treatment\\" also leaves him without any choice in the matter of being good or not. He HAS to be good because he is programmed to be. This, of course, raises the question central to the book: Does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you have no freedom of choice?<br /><br />The book can be a little difficult to get in to at first, predominantly because of Burgess's unique style. The story is narrated by Alex and thus, is written in the complex slang language, invented by Burgess for this book, that the youth of this society engage in. For example, a sentence taken from the opening chapter: \\"He looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that\\" (pg. 5). There is no glossary, but if you stick with it, you will start to develop a feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters. However, if you find yourself having difficulty, a nice, comprehensive lexicon can be found on Wikipedia if you search for \\"English to Nadsat\\" (due to review guidelines I am not allowed to include a direct link). Unfortunately, it is alphabetized by the English equivalents, not by the slang terms, so looking up a word can be a little difficult.<br /><br />One final note of interest: The original British publication of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" had 21 chapters, as does the current American edition. However, when the book was first published in the United States, the last chapter was dropped. As Burgess explains in his introduction to the restored version, publishers considered this 21st chapter a sellout. Whether it is or isn't is up to you to decide, but I can tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book. Without the final part of the story in place, the book offers a bleak message, implying that human nature cannot really change. On the other hand, reading the book with the final chapter in place gives us a little more hope. Beyond that, Burgess tells us in his introduction, interpretation is up to you.when he viddied the four of us like that\\" (pg. 5).

B00005JPCF|5.0|Watching this Academy Award winning movie was time well spent.  The lineup was incredible, consisting of such voices as Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, and Steve Irwin.  Robin Williams was actually the voice of two characters. Well, the things that stand out to me from this movie most are first of all spectacular visuals, and then good music.  It also had a creative storyline and an unexpected twist at the end, which was a nice surprise.  Furthermore, I liked that there was the theme of being different that in the end turned out to be their salvation.  In a way, Mumble the outcast turned out to be a real hero, their savior of sorts.  He really had a knack for tap dancing, and as you may see, the talent comes in very handy.  The baby penguins were adorable, and very hard not to like.  The Leopard Seal evasion sequence was very exciting, and so was the Killer Whale scene.  All in all Happy Feet is a fun film and I am happy to have added it to my movie collection.  I would call it a \\"family\\" film except for the suggestive lyrics in one of the songs by Prince called \\"Kiss\\".  The lyrics go \\"You don't have to be beautiful, to turn me on... I just need your body baby, from dusk till dawn\\".  Other than that, this movie is suitable for kids too.  One can easily overlook those lyrics when weighing in the overall benefit and enjoyment potential from such a film.  If you have young kids, it's your call. Enjoy!
B000AYEIZY|5.0|A review I read about the Live CD's of Cream in the 1960's not inspiring, well I can say to you, \\"Cream's reunion 2005 DVD\\". I can not stop watching this performance, it is so outstanding. Eric Clapton's fantastic guitar work during this reunion is inspirational, and is essential listening to any Cream or Eric Clapton fan. <br />  Eric, with original members Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker performing like the superstars of old, rock the Albert Hall to the delight of thousands who were fortunate enough to be there. For us, the unlucky, this great 2 DVD Set can be ordered, and when played on a surround sound/ big screen system, this show comes alive. With outstanding editing, a high quality soundtrack, excellant near HD quality picture, this concert is at the top of my top ten list. This DVD sets the standard for outstanding music DVD videos.
0060723513|3.0|I was assigned this book as a college student several years ago in one of my religion courses. It accompanied me on my many moves since college in my boxes of books I keep in storage. I read it again just recently and realized once again that it has to be one of the most amazing, uplifting, and inspiring books that I've ever read. It seemed to connect with me in a way that very few books have. When I finished the book I was completely at ease, and thankful that there was a group of people somewhere in Australia with such a clear and beautiful understanding of all of life. I felt reminded of what true wisdom is and free to let go of some of the lesser important aspects of life (competitiveness, anger etc.) that sometimes cloud our everyday thinking and reasoning and exhaust and deplete us emotionally. <br /> <br />       Now, onto my newfound realizations that there is quite a bit of controversy surrounding this book regarding its truthfulness (Did it, any of it, actually happen?)To be honest I was shocked and dismayed by the fact that it may not be true at all. Why? As Oprah Winfrey has expressed eloquently just in the past year, even if something touches you emotionally and spiritually the truth does matter. Yes, it matters if this group exists because even if it sold as fiction, the reader is strongly relying on the fact that such a journey did take place-based on the author's own statements. <br /> <br />       Far more important than the reader's personal feelings is the welfare of actual Aboriginal Australians, many of whom have expressed shock and dismay at the picture that this book paints of their culture and people- a picture which they believe is inaccurate. And if this book touches a nerve in the very people the author intends it to honor, that is significant.  <br /> <br />        I will still hang onto this book. Truth be told, I did learn a lot from it, and part of me still hopes that it is true story- even though much evidence points to the contrary. If not, I am disappointed that the author chose to claim that such an experience happened to her instead of just writing a novel. <br /> <br />       One positive thing that did come out of the reading of this book is an interest in Aboriginal Australian culture. I hope to in the future find some authentic and verifiable ways to honor and learn about their culture. In the meantime I'll keep this book in storage and keep the Bible on my night stand for reference in spiritual matters!
B00062IVKS|5.0|\\"Raging Bull\\" stands out as an all-time classic, easily director Martin Scorsese's greatest work. The film chronicles the life and times of 1940's middleweight boxer Jake Lamotta. In stark contrast to Sylvester Stallone's \\"Rocky\\", this film is more visceral and even ugly at times. LaMotta's personal demons are exorcised in gritty black-and-white, his struggles and rage fleshed out with unflinching realism.<br /><br />The performances in this film are so relaxed, the viewer sometimes feels as if he/she is watching a documentary, a black-and-white reality show set in 1940's Bronx. Frequent improvisation on the part of the actors also contributes to a sense of captured reality. This style of film-making has been widely imitated ever since; such realism in film was virtually non-existent at the time \\"Raging Bull\\" came to the screen.<br /><br />Robert DeNiro gives the performance of his career as the iconic LaMotta. His performance earned him an Oscar for Best Actor. As the \\"Bronx bull\\", DeNiro is tough and passionate. The viewer is drawn to care about this character primarily because of the strong personal connection formed as a result of the realistic, and totally original Scorsese exhibition. Witness the brutal odyssey of a struggling fighter, shot through with flashes of rage and violence. Jake's condition is all too human, his personality illustrated through various conversations and fight sequences. It is an angry and impatient portrayal, Jake simply wants to win, and to do so with his two fists and burning heart. Outside the ring, Jake is restless, impatient and defiant against the rigged establishment that keeps him from getting his title shot. Respect is paramount in Jake's world, any perceived sleight against him is returned with fiery anger. These issues of respect and retribution are instinctive to male viewers, every man can identify with another's struggle for respect and identity, as well as adolescent testosterone flare-ups and territorial immaturity in relationships. All of these essentially male experiences are magnified by Jake's boiling anger, which he unleashes in the ring with nothing short of ferocity.<br /><br />This film avoids clear-cut resolutions. Jake's struggles continue long after his exit from the ring, through physical decline as well as divorce, his peace and happiness remains elusive as he plummets to a variety of lows throughout his retirement. The Mascagni score is passionate and this music provides a steady comfort throughout the peaks of Jake's life, creating an emotional and bittersweet counter-balance to his sad decline.<br /><br />Joe Pesci's portrayal of Jake's brother Joey is also memorable. Joey's own bursts of anger echo those of his brother and Pesci's brilliant performance is a preview of his character Tommy in Scorsese's \\"Goodfellas\\".<br /><br />Cathy Moriarty also shines as Jake's girlfriend (and later wife), Vickie. Scenes between Moriarty and DeNiro reveal genuine, and crucial chemistry between the two.<br /><br />Above all, \\"Raging Bull\\" is a biopic brought to life by Scorsese's genius as a filmmaker. Alongside film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's cuts are imaginative and clever, action in the ring is captured up close and personal and shots are beautifully interchanged to create the right mood for each sequence. As mentioned before, the theme music for this picture is the Intermezzo by Mascagni, a gorgeous Italian piece which accents the bittersweet nostalgia of Jake's career and personal peaks, as well as underlining the sadness of his low points.<br /><br />\\"Raging Bull\\" continues to endure as a classic film as well as a milestone in movie-making.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have nothing but praise for this realization of Jane Eyre.  I saw what aired on the BBC as \\"Episode 3,\\" the third hour, last October in Scotland and was on pins and needles waiting for Masterpiece Theater to bring Jane Eyre to my TV.  Jane's childhood seems to go by quickly, but her experiences and associations are never forgotten and this adaptation makes connections throughout.  Ruth Wilson's Jane is completely fresh and true.  She is on screen throughout and is always in character, her face always expressive.  Toby Stephens is also a powerful Rochester.  Yes, he's handsome!  But he brings more of Rochester's humor and intensity to the role than I've seen in other actors, and he is \\"eyes-open,\\" a Rochester whose past is never far from his mind -- very interesting.  The script ties in incidents beautifully and uses much of the text of the novel.  It is very clever.  There is a scene in the novel that is one of my favorites that is altered here but to me works better for purposes of this program:  Jane returns to Thornfield after attending Mrs. Reed -- in the novel she is overcome with emotion and tries to sneak past Rochester unseen.  This is used earlier in the dramatization, when she unexpectedly comes upon Rochester watching dragonflies on the grounds of Thornfield.  However, her speech (\\"Thank you for your great kindness\\") on returning from Mrs. Reed's deathbed -- is used intact and in context.  Anyway -- it is a very good production in my opinion.  I have edited this review to add praise for the entire cast.  In particular, praise for Pam Ferris in giving Grace Poole depth.  The BBC website, in its section on this production of Jane Eyre, includes Grace Poole's story, written by Ms. Ferris.  The soundtrack is beautiful and brings me to tears!  I hope that we will someday have a CD of Rob Lane's soundtracks.  He also composed the soundtrack for \\"To the Ends of the Earth.\\"<br /><br />Make note of the other reviews here!  You may wish to wait for a coming version that includes the extra features included in the British release.includes the extra features included in the British release.
B000002J27|5.0|After releasing the mammoth two disc concept album \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" original Genesis vocalist Peter Gabriel decided to leave the band.  After an endless string of auditions the band finally decided that Phil Collins would move out from behind the drum kit to front the band on vocals.  Since the beginning Gabriel had been so much the focus of the band that for most fans it was just about impossible to imagine the band going on without him.  Collins moving to the front was viewed as very desperate move and many fans of the band expected the worst.  Much to just about everyone's surprise the resulting project \\"Trick Of The Tail\\" was an outstanding album that both captured the classic Genesis sound, but also moved in new directions.  The band was out to prove the point that Peter Gabriel was not the only reason for the band's success, and prove it they did.  Every song on this disc is strong and many of them have become Genesis classics.  \\"Dance On A Volcano\\", \\"Entangled\\", \\"Squonk\\", \\"Mad Man Moon\\", \\"Robbery Assault And Battery\\" (for me the weakest track on the disc), \\"Ripples\\", \\"Trick Of The Tail\\" and the finale \\"Los Endos\\".  All of these are great with each band member contributing to the writing.  The music here is top notch too, with Hackett and Banks especially standing out.  Collins is great on lead vocals as he proves to have a voice equal to, if not better than, that of Peter Gabriel.  The later Collins era Genesis albums would eventually sink into much more commercial pop territory, but at this point Genesis were still at the top of their game.  This album is essential for fans of progressive rock.
B000063DI8|2.0|What the heck happened to Maiden on this album?  OK, so they lost Adrian Smith, who was a great & versatile guitarist and replaced him with Janick Gers, who is basically just a generic heavy metal guitarist, but that doesn't explain why this album is so horrible.  The lyrics are pathetic and the music is just sub-standard for Maiden. To me, this album seems like it wants to go in the direction of Bruce Dickinson's first solo album (\\"Tattooed Millionaire\\") but can't quite get there. <br /> <br />\\"Tailgunner\\" is a good song, but that's about it.  Just pass on this one; nearly every Maiden album before and after it is a lot better (except for \\"Virtual XI\\", maybe).
B00080ZG1A|3.0|This 2004 Howard Hughes biopic stands out amongst the best biographical pictures of the last 10 years. Although not as gritty and intense as Scorsese's greatest film \\"Raging Bull\\" (1980), this picture is well-crafted and sleek. The life and times of the enigmatic Howard Hughes make for compelling subject matter and Socorsese's effort does not disappoint.<br /><br />Those of us Scorsese fans that look upon his work as commercially defiant, and nuanced towards sophisticated viewers have witnessed a gradual, relentless modifying of his technique toward a wider demographic. This evolution of Scorcese's once radical film-making style towards a more commercial, big budget approach is natural and expected given the increasing commercial success of each successive Scorsese film, (not to mention major studio desire to release the next potential Scorsese classic i.e. \\"GoodFellas\\"). These changes in style and presentation are also closely linked to the diverse screenplays and proliferation of new A-list talent (such as Mr. DiCaprio) headlining Scorsese's recent pictures. Given these considerations, \\"The Aviator\\" still manages to showcase quite a few original Scorsese sequences recalling his raw and intensely personal early films.<br /><br />Howard Hughes was a filmmaker as well as an aviator and it's no surprise that the chaotic production of Hughes first film ,1930's \\"Hell's Angels\\" (which Scorsese clearly admires) is chronicled in detail at the outset of the movie. We witness the continuous nervous energy and persistent drive of Hughes to achieve his daring goals, all the while breaking new ground in aviation, film and big business. This film closely tracks Hughes' personal life as well, his well-publicized affairs with famous starlets of the day such as Katherine Hepburn (played well by Cate Blanchett) are illustrated in-depth with notable performances throughout.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio continues to grow and develop under Scorsese's direction, and the development is phenomenal to witness. Beginning with \\"Gangs Of New York\\" (2002) and continuing beyond this movie (2006's masterful \\"The Departed\\"), DiCaprio's acting chops are sharpening with each performance, eclipsing his previous work and establishing his talent amongst Hollywood's A-List actors. As the Hughes character, DiCaprio is able to captivate and compel us with flashes of OCD symptoms and manic behavior to the extreme, all the while struggling to balance these chaotic forces with his public and managerial personas. A fascinating example of this balancing act occurs when Hughes is confronted with a ruthless public relations attack, designed to coerce him into selling his airline TWA to his commercial competitor, Pan Am (whose chief, Juan Trippe is played by Alec Baldwin). Hughes collects his faculties and battles back with impressive vigor, this after nearly dying in a spectacular crash of his XF-11 spy plane prototype. All of these events unfold beautifully and the rhythm of this film holds our attention despite the nearly 3 hour running time.<br /><br />\\"The Aviator\\" holds up well on repeat viewings despite the long running time, it covers the entire first half of Hughe's remarkable life and career, and a second feature could easily be written detailing Hughes' subsequent years in Las Vegas and his premature death. All in all, DiCaprio's growth as an actor cannot be understated, this is a must-see performance!t is phenomenal to witness.

B000LXHK2C|2.0|I gave two stars to this movie for exactly two benefits I gained from watching it.  These benefits are illustrated by the next two paragraphs.<br /><br />There is absolutely beautiful cinematography.  Depictions of Provence, a region of France adjacent to both the Mediterranean Sea and Italy, were bountiful and beautiful.  Director Ridley Scott's showcasing of the scenes representing Provence is enough to make one consider clicking the \\"complete order\\" button for a 14-day European vacation extravaganza.<br /><br />That catchy little tune by Alizee, \\"Moi Lolita\\", made a brief appearance in the movie which catapulted the song back into my consciousness.  The song, of course, is one of many attempts by the media to capitalize on the cultural sensation of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel, \\"Lolita\\", but that is another story entirely.<br /><br />*plot summation information below*<br /><br />The essence of the story is the tired clich&eacute; of greedy, amoral pig finding meaning, love, and purpose via the simple equation of:  abandoned family estate + attractive native love interest + beautiful French countryside = happiness.  Max (Russell Crowe) is a wildly successful but unscrupulous power broker, who never met a market he didn't want to manipulate.  Following a particularly successful business adventure, his assistant clues him in to the possibility that he is at risk of being investigated by the trade regulatory commission.  As a partial solution, she and his superiors recommend that he take a temporary leave of absence from the company, preferably out of the country, until the heat dies down.  As luck would have it, Max's uncle recently died in Provence, and since he left no will, the winery previously under his care is automatically bequeathed to Max, as he is the closest known relative.<br /><br />*end plot summation information*<br /><br />Many have complained about the sheer predictability of the plot, and that is definitely a negative aspect of this film, but not necessarily a terminal one.  What did kill my enjoyment of the film is the utterly nonsensical editing.  Scenes flash by without any semblance of explanation.  Cut to a conversation, seemingly for no reason at all, explain nothing, and then cut do the next scene just as one is beginning to soak up the scenery.  Include several characters in scenes without any actual suggested or implied reason for their placement there.  Speed up the action in one or two semi-montage scenes in the vein of a physical-comedy film, with no pre- or post-scene comedic introduction or resolution.  Finally, splice in a post-\\"fin\\" scene which could only be described as surreal.<br /><br />In essence, this movie was 200 mini-films spliced into one.  At least, that's the impression I got, and it totally destroyed my suspension of disbelief.  There are other negatives:  the lame stereotyping (of secretaries, of Americans, of European humor), plots that go nowhere (\\"good\\"/\\"bad\\" wine secret \\"conspiracy\\"), and humor attempts which can only be labeled as \\"wince-inducing\\", among many, many other detrimental attributes.<br /><br />Not even worth renting, unless your friend has already rented it, AND you have cleaned all the gunk you could reasonably be expected to clean out of your fingernails already.<br /><br />Romantic comedy lovers:  this is neither romantic nor funny, so if you just HAVE to see the handsome Russell Crowe or the beautiful Marion Cotillard, buy a poster instead.<br />\\"Gladiator\\" or \\"Black Hawk Down\\" fans:  no, even with the breakneck editing, it is still not an action movie.<br />Scenery fans:  turn off the audio, fast-forward to the \\"scenery\\" scenes, and keep the Semillon flowing...I would recommend three bottles per person.enjoyment of the film is the utterly nonsensical editing.

0743455967|5.0|Who better to learn the craft from than Stephen King,  one of the masters of popular fiction?  This is what I thought when finally picking this book up a few days ago. As it turns out, I was quite right.  Having read this book, I have been re-inspired to try my hand at fiction, a life-long goal.<br /><br />The book is part memoir and part practical guide to breaking into the business.  The memoir part focuses on select portions of King's life that were key to his success on his road to publication.  Any fan of his books would find these portions amusing and enlightening.  The prolific author is as much a part of the cultural landscape as his stories are, and it was great to get an inside look into some of his life story.<br /><br />The best portion of the book, however, is the meat of it--the portion in which he lays down his \\"rules\\" for success.  He describes several important tools that any aspiring writer needs, including  a copy of Strunk and White's Elements of Style, which I have made a mental note to get a copy of. My favorite part of the whole book, however, in practical terms, was King's portrayal of a writer named \\"Frank\\", who is really a composite of three young, moderately successful authors who have some general things in common.  As I read this portion, I made a mental note of the steps I have already completed along the way, should I follow this pathway.  \\"Frank's\\" path to success includes a degree in English (check!), an eventual fallback career teaching secondary English (check!), submission to many little literary magazines (check!), persistence (check!), his eventual publication in these periodicals, garnering of a relatively prestigious award for one short story, his beginning crack at a novel, and his acquisition of a literary agent to help publish aforemntioned novel (um...not check). The way King lays this path out in the book reads like, well, a how-to text, which is how it's intended.  He states that an aspiring writer could do worse that following Frank's example.  It's inspiring to read about \\"Frank,\\" because I would never dream of having the success King has enjoyed during his long career.  It is practical and realistic to compare my potential with that of some other up-and-coming authors, rather than the multi-billion copy-selling author who penned this book.  While it is only one path one might take, \\"Frank's\\" method for success(not very different from King's, really) is one that makes sense to me, and it validated the decisions I had recently made to go the route of literary magazines.<br /><br />The funny thing about this book --besides King's often humorous take on the topics of life and writing--is that when it comes right down to it, his advice is very similar to every other honest author's opinion when asked what should aspiring authors do: write a lot, read a lot, and be persistent.  Nevertheless, it's a helluva lot of fun reading America's avuncular pop laureate pontificate on a subject he has proven himself to be expert at.  You'll find yourself inspired and enlightened when you close the book.hat following Frank's example.

B000002J2B|5.0|When fans talk about the great Genesis albums this one is usually not one of the first that come to mind.  The 2nd album of the Phil Collins era had a lot to live up to after the success of \\"Trick Of The Tail\\".  This one did not seem to go over as well, but for me it has always been an underrated gem in the band's catalogue.  The album is very moody and keyboard heavy, probably due to the fact that Tony Banks wrote the lions share of material here.  The album would prove to be guitarist Steve Hackett's last, and although his contribution is somewhat muted here, when he does get the chance to solo he really shines.  The album opens with \\"Eleventh Earl Of Mar\\" which has long been one of my favorite Genesis tunes even though I am still not sure what the heck it is about.  \\"One For The Vine\\" is next with prime Genesis storytelling.  \\"Your Own Special\\" way foreshadows the romantic ballads that would become a staple of the band down the road.  \\"Wot Gorilla\\" is a cool instrumental.  \\"All In A Mouse's Night\\" shows off the always present sense of humor.  \\"Blood On The Rooftops\\" is subtle social commentary.  \\"Unquiet Slumbers For The Sleepers\\" is an instrumental where Steve Hackett gets to show off his technique.  The finale \\"Afterglow\\" features what has become a somewhat clichéd prog rock climax, but works as a bombastic finish to the album with Phil Collins singing is tail off.  Although different from \\"Trick Of The Tail\\" I find \\"Wind And Wuthering\\" to be just about as good and another essential part of the Genesis catalogue.
B000001ESP|5.0|What more can be said about \\"Moving Pictures\\" that the other reviewers have not already mentioned?  This is simply one of the all time best rock albums, and any true fan of the genre should own it - even if you generally don't appreciate Rush.  There isn't a bad song on this album. Even though this was released in 1981, it still sounds modern and current.  In my opinion, this is one people will be listening to 100 years from now, and beyond. <br />
B000055X3U|5.0|Anathema, a band that has progressed from their slow, doom metal beginnings with the grunts and moans of Darren White to a more alternative, straight-forward rock, almost Radiohead-sounding at times band.   <br /> <br />I won't review each song individually so please read the below. <br /> <br />High points:  <br />- Vincent Cavanagh's vox on this record never seem to dwindle at points as they did on past efforts such as \\"Eternity.\\"   <br />- Great songwriting.  I must stress that this album MUST BE listened to in it's entirety for full effect.   <br />- Cohesiveness/flow - The songs flow together really well as the band has seemed to sew up that lack of cohesiveness demonstrated on the \\"Alternative 4\\" album (still a good album though). <br />- Production/sound - All instruments on \\"Judgement\\" are audible and sound great.  Mixing and mastering are done to a tee.   <br /> <br />Low points: <br />- The lyrics at certain points.  Historically, Anathema's lyrics are either very strong or mediocre and somewhat contrieved.  There never seems to be an in-between and there's no difference here.  Sometimes they go too far in emulating their idols, Pink Floyd, by seemingly stealing their lyrics.  \\"Hey you, rotting in your alcoholic shell...?\\"  <br />- Weakest link in the album flow is \\"Don't Look Too Far.\\"  Not a bad song at all by it's own merits (not filler).  Personally, it's just never appealed to me and grabbed me in a way the rest of the songs on the album do. <br /> <br />The minor lyrics issues aside, this is a must buy album.  That being said, if you want to hear some beautifully-crafted music, get this now!  It's by far Anathema's best work I've heard thus far.  I just completed my collection by picking up \\"The Silent Enigma\\" and \\"A Natural Disaster\\" and have yet to really LISTEN to these albums. <br /> <br />Bottom line: If you only own only one Anathema album, make \\"Judgement\\" the one. <br /> <br />
B0002PZVH0|5.0|Brian Eno's \\"Music for Airports\\" is so easy to misinterpret.  It's original purpose was simple.  Eno wanted to create soothing sounds to calm the nerves of frightened flyers.  Many people are afraid of flying and this was an experiment designed to relax and reassure passengers of their safety.  It was actually installed at the Marine Air Terminal of New York's LaGuardia Airport for some time.      Ambient music is not a very popular genre of music but that's because it forces the listener to think for themselves as opposed to music that feeds you pre-meditated thoughts.  When you listen to this you can think about whatever you want to think about.      These tracks will bring out the gentle side in anyone, if you allow it to.  With so much high-octane and hyper-kinetic pace in music, movies, television and entertainment in present times; it's nice to just meditate and get lost in your thoughts.      So turn off your lights and be ready to give \\"Music for Airports\\" a chance before you laugh out loud at your stereo.  With the right setting and proper introduction, this can inspire the world's most reputable cynic.
B000002J2D|4.0|\\"And Then There Were Three\\" marked a major transition point for Genesis.  Steve Hackett was gone and the band were down to just three original members, Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford, and Tony Banks.  The result of this would find the band moving in a more commercial direction and somewhat away from their prog rock roots.  The majority of the material on \\"Three\\" is shorter with the longest track clocking in at slightly over 7 minutes.  Most of the rest of the songs reside in the 3 to 4 minute range.  The album was also the first to find the band breaking into the top 40 singles charts in the U.S. with the album closer \\"Follow You Follow Me\\".  Mike Rutherford took over the guitar duties from Steve Hackett.  While Mike is a competent guitarist he is not in the same league with Hackett which somewhat diminishes from the music here.  This is somewhat made up for by Tony Banks wall of keyboards, and Phil Collins outstanding drumming.  This album gets slogged by a lot of Genesis fans as a \\"sell out\\" bowing to the lure of big money and radio airplay.  Personally I have always liked it.  The album is probably not as strong as it's predecessors, but most of the songs are good and there is still enough progginess here to please the hard core fan.  Highlights include \\"Down And Out\\", \\"Snowbound\\", \\"Burning Rope\\", \\"Deep In The Motherload\\".  All of these are solid and there really are no songs that I don't like on the disc.  The single \\"Follow You Follow Me\\" closes the album and almost sounds like something that was tacked on at the end.  It really does not fit all that well with the rest of the material in style.  None of the songs on this album have become what most fans consider classics with very few of them played in the Genesis live show very many years after this album's tour.  Still, this is one of those discs that I don't pull out very often, but when I do I am always pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoy it.
B000063DIH|3.0|This album is a big improvement over \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\", which was one of the worst albums Iron Maiden ever released.  Sure, there are still some dogs on \\"Fear of the Dark\\", but there are some highlights too, notably the title track and \\"Judas Be My Guide\\", both of which are strong songs.  The lyrics are still a weak point on this album - not that Maiden has ever really been about the lyrics, but these are generally pretty sub-standard and silly.   This doesn't compare to the classic period (Number of the Beast - Seventh Son) but it's still a decent album.

B000MQ54OO|3.0|I blind-bought \\"Happy Feet\\" thinking that since it won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, it would be pretty good, right?  Well, I was wrong.  This movie is some of the more boring family fare I've ever seen.  If it couldn't keep my attention, I don't know how it could hold that of a child. In the second half, it becomes a transparent plea for our environment.  An agreeable message, yes, but it feels forced, mawkish, and conflicting with the film's earlier theme of being yourself.  The ending is also extremely abrupt and unsatisfying.  The special features are unimpressive at best, featuring two additional scenes that are even worse than the movie, a \\"dance lesson\\" from Savion Glover, that serves only to teach what is your heel and what is your toe, the misleading trailer, and a vintage WB cartoon that is be no means a classic.  The only thing keeping this disc a 3 star is the stunning picture quality.  It almost looks like you are actually sitting in the Arctic.  Some images are simply beautiful... if only they had a good movie wrapped around them.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is another example of a great documentary.  Whether you agree with the statements here or not, it serves it purpose very convincingly of getting the discussion sturring about changing the practices we currently have going on that are affecting the planet we live on.  Gore goes beyond just talking about doing something, but has a few solutions and ideas on how to fix the problems as he sees them.   This is probably one of the best documentaries of the last 5 years, over those of michale moore and Morgan Spurlock.  Check this out, worth a watching.  The DVD has an update since the theatrical release which is great to find out about also.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|It's about a father, who doesn't want to become one of those statistic absentee Dads.  It's about a smart man, who's motivated to learn and be at the top of the heap.  It's about a strong man, who keeps on going despite life doing everything it can to knock him down.  And yes, it's about a Black man who succeeds and is still very much his own man.    <br /> <br />Will Smith and his son Jaden are amazing as the father-son team, but that's not where the story ends.  The minister for a homeless shelter is playing himself.  And the man whose life story is being told has a walk on role, too.   <br /> <br />By far, one of the most amazing movies I have seen in a long time.  Definitely a must see, if you're in pursuit of happyness or teetering on the fringes of hope.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|Don't wait--buy now!  They are remastering these, and the originals will disappear.  As mentioned in a number of reviews below--anyone who says the transfers are crap and the show doesn't run for 50 minutes has bought bootlegs from somewhere.  My set has beautiful, 50-minute episodes.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Little Miss Sunshine is a surprise. You didn't expect what you see. You laugh, you cry but you're always moved till the last minute. Every actor is just terrific, especially Steve Carell, so funny as usual. It's a brilliant comedy, that has quite rightly received a great amount of awards.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|Ever since Hollywood has been producing and releasing films,it has always been quite interesting to see how they depict history into an entire film. So,with \\"The Good Shepherd\\" taking place the eras of World War II and the Bay of Pigs,with a great cast of actors (Matt Damon,Angelina Jolie,Robert De Niro,Alec Baldwin,William Hurt,and,despite the fact that you only get a cameo appearance out of him,Joe Pesci),the film is great,right?    Unfortunately,the answer to that question is wrong.    First of all,\\"The Great Shepherd\\" has one of the strongest plots ever to be used for a movie. It is about a young man named Edward Wilson (Matt Damon),who has had a tough life. During the middle of his childhood,he lost his father to suicide. And,even though his attendance at Yale University gave Edward Wilson a strong chance for success in his adult life,Edward made two mistakes during his college years. Those mistakes? Accepting an invitation into the Office of Strategic Services (the CIA's predecessor)by a general named Bill Sullivan(Robert De Niro)during World War II,and getting a young woman named Margaret Ann Russell(Angelina Jolie)pregnant. Now,years have passed by,and as Edward realizes he made mistakes,he must deal with two hard tasks at the same time:1)saving his marriage,and 2)investigating the Office of Strategic Services (this is during the Bay of Pigs era)with Sam Murach (Alec Baldwin)and Philip Allen (William Hurt),while he keeps his work in the OSS during World War II a secret. Can Edward Wilson succeed at all of this,or has his past mistakes done too much damage to his current life?    So,what sends \\"The Good Shepherd\\" downhill? First of all,this film's script is completely messy and unarranged. The events that are documented in this film are not documented in chronological order,and are presented back and forth. This makes the film hard to follow and understand,and does not give its viewers the information they would want to know concerning Edward Wilson's servicein the Office of Strategic Services and his investigation of the OSS. Second of all,there are several events in this film that pop up out of the blue,and have NOTHING to do with the film's plot,with no explanation as to why the certain event (unfortunately,and most notably,this film's one and only scene that feautures Joe Pesci)is in the film. The acting here is strong,but does not even come close to saving this film.    Overall,a film that had potential to be a great film,but was unfortunately ruined by its lazy script. Unless you are just interested to see Joe Pesci after the total of eight years that Pesci was M.I.A.,\\"The Good Shepherd\\" is a waste of time and money.
0895260131|1.0|This is simply a propagada book. There are no facts, just fiction. The writer tries whatever he can to twist the facts about Islam. Every text written can be taken wrong. Not all 1.3 Billion muslims terrorists. Many are good loving people who follow the word of the Quran. Too bad people believe lies so easily.
B000JJ4PDK|5.0|Although Life After Death was excellent, Ready to Die was a landmark album. It is cool to hear the angrier Biggie on some songs and an others the smooth, slick Biggie we all know. His flow is outstanding and his lyrics and content truly capture his life's story. It will always remain one of the top hip hop albums of all time. <br />
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This is just an amazing movie. For absolute Scorsese fans, it's an unforgettable experience beyond all superlatives: superbly written, brilliantly directed, wonderfully acted, cleverly edited. Beautiful music, powerful dialogs, sex, drug and blood, we're so close to perfection. What craftmanship!
B000I5X81K|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Josh Groban's and listening to both of his previous CDs have moved me to tears on more than one occasion but after listening to Awake over and over again, I have to say that I'm disappointed.  I can't seem to find the same Josh in this CD, I know that he's trying to modernize his music but this \\"new style\\" of music doesn't really suit him, I particularly dislike his singing falsetto, he has such a powerful voice with an incredible range, he should use it. Of all of songs, I like the February Song and as much as I love the Romeo and Juliet song, I feel that his passion is somewhat lacking.  This is definitely not his best work and I'm looking forward to his next CD.
B000EJ9N6Y|5.0|I'm one of the listeners who isn't totally familiar with most of the 70s/80s originals ... and maybe because of that I really find that this album stands alone. The 'Nouvelle Vague' style given to all of these covers is intriguing and definitely catchy. Those who like bossa nova and the new soft-voiced European style should check into this album. The vocals unexpectedly drew me in and captured me after several listens ... but the instrumentation is excellent. Relaxing. Two tracks - 'Dance With Me' and 'O Pamela' - stand out in this album, both for their bittersweet intrigue. After listening to the album several times through, though, it was 'Ever Fallen in Love' and 'Escape Myself' that really stuck in my head ... so that later on I'd find myself humming different parts from these two ... and then have to listen to them again just to get them right. Bande a Part is standalone ... but I myself bought it with Nouvelle Vague's self-titled cd, so I feel that these two really go hand-in-hand, with the consistent style. Both are definitely keepers -- I can listen to them over and over regularly, and haven't tired of them yet.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is one of the greatest Pink Floyd albums out there, even if its ambition keeps it from being quite as popular. Waters' lyrics are becoming increasingly dark and even angry, especially on \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones),\\" but they're downright brilliant throughout Animals. The concept is clear, articulate, and powerful, and the music matches it note for note. This is a crowning achievement not only in Pink Floyd's outstanding oeuvre, but in the entire rock genre. Animals is proof that rock can be art; and, in fact, it can do so without being pretentious. Just listen to it!
B000LC55F2|4.0|The Prestige is both brilliant and entertaining. Thanks to a clever screenplay and a beautiful photography, Christopher Nolan creates a bewitching atmosphere, and directs a compelling movie with a great ending. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, perfect in their roles, are just mesmeric. A must-have movie in your DVD collection.
1878424319|1.0|Too esoteric for me....not what I would call outstanding writing...even given the cultural background of the writer.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|I would normally give this product 1 star but it did pick up everything so I gave it 2; however, when I got my Swivel Sweeper I couldn't figure out why they included a seam ripper.  After reading the instructions it stated to use it to clean the brushes...OK not a problem.  Well I have two long hair cats and every thing I just swept up got caught around the brushes.  I took me 3 times as long to clean the brushes than it did to sweep the house.  I bought this to save me some time...what a joke!
1592401791|5.0|Everyone knows of George Martin's relationship with The Beatles but many probably do not know Geoff Emerick, who was initially an incredibly young assistant when the Beatles came into EMI and he eventually graduates to become the engineer for many of the Beatles records. He offers an interesting and critical eye of the Beatles primarily from a working relationship. He is obviously a deep admirer of Lennon and McCartnery resulting in a more critical eye for Harrison and Starr. In the case of the latter two, some may be sensitive of his comments particularly when he makes sharp comments such as calling Harrison a \\"ham fisted\\" player on some recording attempts. However, he is comparing George and Ringo with John and Paul, which is an unfair comparison. Thus he views the Fab Four warts and all through studio time with only some personal contacts, mostly with with Paul who he obviously admires for his technical musical ability and his perfectionist preferences that later contribute to antagonize his mates by the end of the Beatles run. In Lennon he notes his sharp wit along with his quick sarcasm that could be searing at times and in contrast to McCartney his requests for a special sound was expressed in more intangible terms, perhaps due to a natural perception of music in contrast to a purely technical sense, that took more time to determine by an engineer what could be done to create the sound he wanted. Of course Emerick explains in great detail how he enhanced the Beatles sound particularly as they continually wanted to develop a unique sound and to experiment to create the music they wanted. The book evolves through the course of the group's albums, and Emricks notes that chaos picks up steam during the White Album as the group virtually peaks, as Emerick briefly quits working with them. Emrick claims a lack of enthusiasm with Harrison's songs, previously admitted by Martin in the early days, that often led to less then perfect play by John and Paul, which Emrick later admits was difficult for George's confidence.  However, by Abbey Road, Emrick notes that the Beatles could still pull of their great vocal harmonies and he recognized that Harrison became a very accomplished guitar player and song writer of merit and that Ringo, cajoled into entering the spotlight, provides the great drum solo. The book is a somewhat self serving for Emrick and it may be that he himself is a perfectionist, which may be why he has such great admiration for McCartney. Interesting look of the fab four who literally lived in the studio and Emerick was virtually on the deck as the Beatles split into different directions. Emerick also covers his realationships with the Beatles after the break, particularly with Paul, but the magic of the book is when they were still \\"The Beatles\\". I particularly enjoyed  McCartney's quite glib comment to Yoko who constantly referring to The Beatles in the third person such as  \\"Beatles must do this or that\\". His response, according to Emrick, \\"Actually, it's 'The Beatles', Luv.\\"ater admits was difficult for George's confidence.

B000HEWEE4|3.0|I watched this film with an open mind and through the first half hour or so, I was thinking....\\"is this as dumb as it seems\\"? I was interested in the story enough to watch the entire movie and in the end, I thought it was OK. I did figure out the ending long before it happened and some things don't add up, but....it's worth a look with your sweetheart on a lazy rainy day.
B00005PJ6M|2.0|I loved Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. It's one of my favorite \\"teen\\" flicks. This however, I did not like as much. While the first one was brilliantly stupid, this one was just stupid. Believe me there's a huge difference between the two films. If you watch this, I promise you, you are guaranteed to have your IQ drop. The characters they meet, Station for example, are so stupid looking they remind me of kind of monsters you would find in a little kid's Saturday morning cartoon show. Only in this case, the creature is not animated so it looks million times more ridiculous. I still don't understand why it needed to morph into two little creatures. And the evil Bill and Ted were equally stupid. I mean what was up with them trashing the place for no reason? And why on earth were they detaching their heads? Was this scene really necessary for the general flow of the film? This entire film was ruined by stupid stuff like that. However, if I had found this movie in my cereal box, like some people apparently have, I probably wouldn't be complaining as much. The movie did have some funny parts. At least Bill and Ted's dialogue didn't become redundant......... or at least not in an unfunny way. Their comments were still almost as funny as the first film's, if not funnier in some cases. And the showdown between Death and Bill and Ted was also hilarious, but considering I rented the film and didn't get it in my cereal box, neither of these things makes up for the unwanted appearance of the Easter bunny. What on earth was the director thinking? this film reminds me of a blend of funny jokes with stupid situations. So in conclusion, this movie could have probably been good, if they had changed a few things. Unfortunately, however, they didn't. In result this movie for the most part is unbearable.  <br /> <br /> <br />P.S. If you haven't seen Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, don't let your opinion of this film get in the way. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure was hilarious beyond belief.
0786867973|5.0|I received this book as a gift a few years ago and can honestly that I have tried at least 75% of the recipes.  I was always intimidated by baking (after numerous basic cake and cookie disasters) and before this book, would never have attempted recipes that appear so challenging.  Nigella is a wonderful writer who takes the intimidation factor out completely by using a down-to-earth tone.  It feels like you are baking alongside an irreverant, sassy girlfriend!
B000NPHGZO|3.0|About the last 50 minutes or so was the best part of the movie.  The beginning was very slow moving which frankly was tough to sit through.  I would recommend this movie only if you are a diehard mystery fan and can't find another movie.  Not bad for a rental, but I personally would not purchase it and I'm glad I didn't pay the theater price.
0780622553|3.0|This is a very cool film. A dreamlike movie with it's story of amnesia and surreal set design. It can get a bit confusing at times, but I thought it was a very bold attempt that succeeds on many levels. The DVD is excellent with some great extras and a good DVD transfer. Please don't call me a F***ing Tool for not giving it 5 stars!....LOL!;-b (someone did this in a comment).....too mucking fuchh! ;-)

B00005MP58|5.0|Born in Steventon, Hampshire in 1775, Jane Austen was one of two daughters of the Reverent George Austen and his wife Cassandra. She was educated in Oxford and in Southampton, finally attending a boarding school in the Abbey gatehouse in Reading, Berkshire. The environment provided by her home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her family, something that gave her the opportunity to present her stories and develop the characters in depth.     Jane Austen's works are imaginative, full of emotion and depicting relationships that transcend time. Jane Austen wrote about society, about propriety and about etiquette. She was highly critical of the snobbery with which the upper classes kept away from others. Her study of human flaws and prsonal relationships provide great material for the development of her characters.    Jane Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in 1813 and it still enchants audiences all over the world. The first time I read this book, I read as a child, back in Cuba, \\"Orgullo y Prejuicio.\\"     The writings of Jane Austen shaped my perception of true love as I identified with the love between Elizabeth Bennet and her one and only, Mr. Darcy. With this BBC adaptation completed in 1996, I have been able to relive the experience of exposing myself to a classic, one of the best books ever written. With this BBC miniseries we feel as though we were reading the book, for the adaptation faithfully follows the author's writing.     The filming is magnificent, offering us a view of gorgeous scenery, magnificent castles, and locations that bring the book to life, for we can see what we expected after reading the book. The love story presents the struggle of the times, as two individuals fall in love, regardless of class differences, or status, and yet, the antagonism and friction created as a result of said differences. Darcy is a wealthy single man who, upon meeting the family of Elizabeth, boisterous, non-polished, and simple, believes her to bebeneath him. The meet at a dance where his best friend falls in love with Elizabeth sister, but Darcy thinks he knows Jane's heart not to be true to these emotions. Elizabeth overhears a conversation during the dance and feels insulted by the proud and distant Darcy, keeping her distance and yet, without her awareness, falling in love with him. Jane Austen is masterful at creating enough tension to keep us all in suspense as to the path these lives will take as some members of Elizabeth family make the wrong choices.     The dialogue is almost verbatim to the book, making this series a true delight for those of us who identify with this work. Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth and Colin Firth as Darcy provide magnificent interpretations of this timeless classic, keeping us all dreaming of ever encountering love of this magnitude in our lives. As with most DVDs that we own, we watch by selecting English subtitles, which enhances the viewing by allowing us NOT to miss a single word said by the characters. Who would want to miss a single word in this marvel of the English language? There is a documentary as an additional bonus, where interviews with cast members are included... simply awesome! Interviewed are:  Jennifer Ehle [Elizabeth], Colin Firth [Darcy]. We also get to see those who played Mary Bennet [Lucy Briers], Mr. Collins [David Bamber, Mr. Bingley [Crispin Bonham-Carter] and Mr. Wickham [Adrian Lukis].
B00003CXA2|5.0|An engrossing story of a simple man. This movie covers so many facets of life that it just can't be summed up in a few sentences. If you haven't seen it, buy it now. The DVD is loaded with extras and has a nice transfer......what are you waiting for? You will not be disappointed.
0743496728|5.0|*****<br /><br />This is my favorite Jodi Picoult book; I have read seven. When you read this, it is like taking a terrifying, fast (because you can't stop reading it) dive deep into the circumstances and minds of those involved in a school shooting.<br /><br />As the author tells you what each character is thinking and feeling, you get to experience that character's point-of-view and become empathetic to their life. She alternates points-of-view repeatedly throughout the book, which I found a bit difficult and confusing at first, but very quickly got used to, giving you facts about the story from different views: the shooter, the shooter's father, the shooter's mother, the shooter's best friend, school bullies, incidental students, the various attorneys, the key detective, etc.<br /><br />The title represents an amount of time, the amount of time it takes to do many other things besides shoot up a school, killing many. Often we've asked, \\"How could this ever happen?\\" and \\"How did the parents not see what was going on?\\" and imagined that this could never happen in our town or in our family. \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" shows us the fallacy of thinking this way---it could, really could happen to us.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.<br /><br />*****
B000J103PC|1.0|I made my girlfriend a deal: I'll watch The Devil Wears Prada with you if you watch Kung Fu Hustle with me. We watched Kung Fu Hustle first and she enjoyed it, although she fell asleep near the end. The next day we watched this. I found it unbearable to even sit through the first half hour. Wow, what a horrible movie in every way. The over-the-top cuteness, the dumbed down script and generic characters - all awful.  <br />Despite their supposed intentions, it seems to me that movies like this are actually really demeaning to women. I know it's supposed to be a \\"chick flick\\" but how I don't see how most women don't find this movie completely insulting and condescending. <br />Aside from all that, this film uses the same old trick of finding a hot chick and dressing her up in a sweater to make her \\"ugly.\\" And \\"fat.\\" Oh, and I'm sure everyone who works at a fashion magazine making $40k a year is a ridiculously hot model. <br />I know I didn't finish the movie, but I find it hard to believe anything that happens in the second half could possibly forgive the first half. Although my girlfriend did say that even though she agreed with me on almost everything I said about the movie, part of her didn't really mind watching it. Must be something a man will never understand.  <br /> <br />P.S. At least Meryl Streep was good
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This disc is one of the finest live recordings to ever be released commercially.  Here is the young Neil at the peak of his artistry casually displaying his genius to his fellow Canadians (and now to the rest of us).  The initimate recording shows Neil's grace, humor and genius in one convenient package.  I could list highlights (Bad fog of Lonliness, Needle and the Damage Done, Man Needs a Maid/Heart of Gold Suite) but it's hardly necessary, every song is a revelation.  If you really want a treat listen to \\"Old Man\\" here along with Neil's ramblings and then compare it to the performance on last year's \\"Heart of Gold\\" film.  It gives you a glimpse into the life of this wonderful performer. It also gives you an idea of how lucky we all are to have had him lo these 40 years.  Thank you Mr. Young you have touched me yet again.
B00005JPO8|4.0|Early in this film, set in the waning years of Communist power, a minister in the East German government remarks that one thing he has learned is that people never change.  \\"The Lives of Others\\" is a testament to that fact that they do.  Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), an officer of the Stasi, the German secret police, has been assigned to establish a watch over Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a successful  playwright who may have anti-regime tendencies, and his beautiful companion Crista-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), a talented actress who has aroused the sexual interest of the aforementioned minister.  Wiesler, a master of observation and, up to now, totally committed to the East German state, becomes involved in the lives of the two he watches in secret, and gradually a change comes over him.  How matters subsequently develop gives us a window into the complications of human personality, and the many unexpected ways we cope with extraordinary pressure.<br /><br />A richly humane film, beautifully acted.
1400062756|5.0|Let me keep this brief by sorting out for potential buyers why they should consider buying this book despite some negative reviews.  <br />1. This is not a self-help book. It is a summary of a body of research in a scientific field. It is not SUPPOSED to tell you how to achieve riches or social popularity or zen, like self-help works. <br />2. The ideas expressed in this book are not necessarily totally new. Dr. Dweck has been doing research in this field for a long time, and many of the people she cites as growth-minded thinkers were doing it long before she came up with these ideas. However, the reason to buy and read this book is that it lays out for readers the beginnings of a unified theory of how humans learn. Specifically, it focuses on two very general approaches to learning. Yes, the anecodotes seem very simple and repetitive, but they all work to support this theory.  <br />3. I don't want to overstate the importance of the ideas Mindset presents, but in my mind, there's not a person I've ever met (including me) who couldn't improve their own life just by reading, understanding and applying the ideas in this book. Not surprisingly, those who come away from this book complaining that it didn't tell them how to apply the ideas it contains are missing the forest for the trees. It's very difficult to admit when one's faults are exposed . As I said earlier, we all have fixed mindsets about something or other in our lives. Consequently, someone who thinks too much in a fixed mindset hears all the ways that their life could be better if they embraced the idea that they can learn and do anything with the appropriate amount of work, their inate response is: \\"How?\\" The problem is that the solution is too simple for them to admit that they've been missing it their whole lives. There is no real big secret to this book. It simply provides evidence (and anecdotal support) for the idea that a growth mindset can enrich people's lives in a multitude of ways.  <br /> <br />So go out and buy this book if you think that there's something in you life that you'd like to change or if you'd like your children to have a chance to maximize their potential. However, if you recognize yourself as a know-it-all who's willing to suppress your own and other people's potential with strict ideas about what can't be done, don't bother wasting your time.

B000777J2S|5.0|It's been a long time since I last felt the desire to share my thoughts on an album.  True, I've never been a prolific reviewer. In the past, however, I was more receptive of things musical.  Or should I say I was more easily enthused?  Quicker at becoming attuned to the ways in which a textual object would lend itself to interpretation?  Perhaps I was a keener semiotician then, or liked to think that I was.  Perhaps I was more naïve and confident that I could grasp the complexities behind art, or at least that I might be able to uncover (and then convey) one possible meaning treasured within a work of art.  Sadly, a lot has changed in my life over the past two and a half years.<br /><br />Most significantly, I have been through an experience which seems to me to be so close to the one Antony describes incredibly well in I am a Bird Now, by means of the lyrics and the singing style employed.  Does he really describe it though?  I can't positively say.  It sometimes seems like a fallacy on my part, like an easy projection of my life onto suggestions which are polysemous and poetic more than they are specific to any one situation.  However, this realization would lead to self-censuring  and self-castration.  So let's for a minute pretend I'm right.  Let's assume that I am a Bird Now is about Loss, about Grieving, about finding Reason or at least Hope and some Beauty in the midst of personal tragedy.  Let's presume that it talks about the suffering of someone who doesn't feel at ease in their environment, both physical and psychological.<br /><br />That Antony is a gender-bending artist is a given.  That there is ample use of metaphor in his lyrics is likewise undeniable.  While this contributes to making the songs feel painfully sincere, it doesn't strike me as central.  Beyond Antony's gender-defying verbal and vocal renditions (which account for my lax use of pronouns), there seems to be a core topic, that of abandonment and loneliness, the sense that something has happened to place the bird in a cage, making it unable to fly.  That's how the album starts off.  If I am a Bird Now is indeed a story about survival and widowhood, as I like to see it, then it seems also to be a story about communication with those who have left us.  There are many instances in which I see the unrequited monologue of the widow to her (my) loved one and her (my) faith that silent answers can be heard through unexpected channels.  That's how pain and love become inextricably intertwined well beyond common masochism.  Ultimately, the narration seems to develop toward some kind of solution, although it is more about resolve and wishful thinking than it is about actual recovery.  It's an animal-like instinct to move on to a new prey, not by virtue of a predatory urge in and of itself, but for the sake of life over death.  The most innocent of impulses, the one that truly allows for the bird gerhl to fly and then go to heaven.<br /><br />Is it all a fallacy on my part, or is I am a Bird Now really to be taken so seriously?  I do not know, nor do I care.  What I do know is that listening to it made me cry those tears that I had been withholding up until then.  That it stirred me and made me feel like someone was expressing the emotions that I myself was unable to express, even though I wanted to and needed to.  What I do know is that this is the one CD that I have been wanting to review since I first listened to it, breaking my two and a half year reserve.  While this doesn't make my assumptions any more accurate, it does pay honour to Antony and the Johnsons and to I am a Bird Now.  This is a thank you, as well as a heartfelt five-star review.ng has happened to place the bird in a cage, making it unable to fly.  That's how the album starts off.

I do not know, nor do I care.  What I do know is that listening to it made me cry those tears that I had been withholding up until then.  That it stirred me and made me feel like someone was expressing the emotions that I myself was unable to express, even though I wanted to and needed to.  What I do know is that this is the one CD that I have been wanting to review since I first listened to it, breaking my two and a half year reserve.  While this doesn't make my assumptions any more accurate, it does pay honour to Antony and the Johnsons and to I am a Bird Now.  This is a thank you, as well as a heartfelt five-star review.
B000N3ST8O|3.0|Is there a reason \\"Gypsy\\" is missing frm this CD? That's one of my all-time fave Stevie songs....very disappointing!
B000MZHW40|4.0|It is about greed, murder, genocide, atrocities, injustice ...you name it.  Most of all, this movie is about hope for humanity within it all.  It is about a father's love for his son, which is much more valuable than any diamond.  It was about the lengths he would go to save his son.  It is about people opening their eyes to suffering and doing something about it.<br /><br />Yes, this movie was in part about bringing the atrocities to light, but it was also about showing that there is always still hope.
0974153001|5.0|Great book, very informative, in great shape and was received in short time.
0743454537|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the saddest books I've ever read. It not only made me cry once, but at least four times throughout.<br /><br />Okay, I'm not going to give a summary, since there's plenty of summaries, but I'm going to tell you what I think.<br /><br />I thought that the whole book was beautiful. And instead of focusing on just the one issue, there are smaller issues inbetween that are placed just in the right spot to keep our mind busy.<br /><br />Still, it was really fabulously written, and while the end was upsetting I can't really imagine it ending any other way.
0743289684|5.0|I was somwhat aware of Ayaan Hirsu Ali, [...] Now comes the full story. Prepare to be blown away.<br /><br />In \\"Infidel\\" (353 pages), Ayaan Hirsi Ali retells her life's improbable story, starting as a Muslim girl in Somalia, later moving to Saudi-Arabia and Keyna, where she lived for many years before eventually fleeing from an arranged marriage to end up almost accidently in the Netherlands. Along the way, the author exposes the abuse of women in the Muslim world (unspeakable female mutilation, beatings, honor killings, etc.) and eventually becomes an outspoken activist to stop these abuses, leading to what I will call becoming a \\"one cause\\" politician. Interestingly, the author joins the fiscally conservative/socially progressive VVD party. She becomes a superstar in Dutch politics, and ultimately a victim of her own success. She cooperates with Theo Van Gogh on a controversial film about women's abuse in the Muslim world, leading a deranged Muslim to brutally murder Van Gogh and forcing Hirsi Ali to go underground for many months, under full protection of the Dutch security forces as she is an elected member of Dutch parliament.<br /><br />I really admire the courage of the author to step forward and put the spotlight on these issues. She has now left Dutch politics and joined a think-tank in Washington, and I cannot wait what she will do next. In the meantime, this book is terrific, terrifying even, but essential. Be forewarned: this is NOT an easy read, nor something you'll finish up in a few hours. But don't let that deter you. Highly recommended!
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange had me asking myself a lot of questions as I was making my way through it. I'm still asking myself these questions.  <br /> <br />\\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\" <br /> <br />Is it better to be bad by choice or good because you're told to be?  <br /> <br />I can't help but think about the book even though I finished it a month or so ago. Certain scenarios are still racing through my mind and more than ever I am questioning the motives of the people that I interact with. Are they the Clockwork Oranges (with eggyweg in their tummywums) being good little soldiers for fear of the millicents paying them a visit?  <br /> <br />Am I? <br /> <br />That said, this book is fantastic. The lingo that Burgess has invented is very tricky to get to grips with at first, but thankfully by simply understanding the context of unknown words one can easily grasp their meaning.
B000A3H6EA|5.0|In 2005, Sony released without much or any fanfare the terrific \\"Essential Michael Jackson\\", which easily is the best Michael Jackson compilation available these days. It also released a slightly different international version, which I recently picked up while in China. No, I didn't buy it from a pirated-CD hawking character on some street corner. In fact I bought it in a regular CD store in Shanghai, for all of 39 RMB (about US$ 5.50), if you can believe that.<br /><br />The international version of \\"The Essential Michael Jackson\\" (2 CDs, 38 tracks, 156 min.) differs only slightly from the US version:<br /><br />1. The Jacksons' \\"Can You Feel It\\" replaces \\"Enjoy Yourself\\" (an improvement);<br />2. Somehow \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" (from \\"Bad\\") is lumped along with (and in the middle of) the \\"Thriller\\" songs on CD1, obviously not an improvement;<br />3. The title track from \\"Dangerous\\" is left off, and instead 2 tracks from 1995's \\"HIStory\\" second CD of new material are added (\\"Earth Song\\" and \\"They Don't Care About Us\\"), a wash as far as I'm concerned although \\"Earth Song\\" remains a greatly underappreciated tune. How \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" ended up on the \\"essential\\" list, is a head-scratcher (although I like the song).<br /><br />Would I have bought this again if it wasn't for the ridiculous low price in China? Almost certainly not. But I am glad I did, if nothing else, because it is just another memento from my trip to China (the Chinese version comes with Mandarin characters on the cover). That aside, \\"The Essential Michael Jackson\\" is a terrific album, whether you buy the US version or the international version, and it really showcases Michael Jackson at his best.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had heard of the series Firefly; but, being overseas when it was aired, I didn't get a chance to see it before FOX gave it an abortion.  I managed to get it on DVD and watched it for the first time.  Loved it!  Excellent cast, stories, concept.  Thought the western look in a sci-fi was a bit much; however, when you get into the story you over look it.  This was a great series that was shot down before it got a chance to spread its wings.  The movie Serenity gave the Firefly fans a little closer as far as the lore; but, left a lot of ends untied, as did the series.  I enjoyed it this series, I recommend it to any Sci-Fi fans who have not seen it.
B00005R8GU|5.0|Back when Fathers and Sons was originally issued, I was in the ninth grade. As kids in those days seemed to have broader musical tastes than many kids do today, whether or not you owned and liked Fathers and Sons quickly became a measure of musical hipness. Unfortunately, it seems that many of the older kids who were musically hip were also getting in trouble all the time, so it was a little difficult to be a big blues fan and not be seen as at least a potential troublemaker. But looking back, its amazing that we were sharp enough to detect the quality in the play of those who have stood the test of time.<br /><br />Paul Butterfield and Mike Bloomfield were both young white blues heroes of the time and they introduced many thousands of suburban white kids to the black \\"old masters\\" of the Chicago blues scene. Chief among these old masters were guys like Muddy Waters and Otis Spann, both of whom are featured on this album. The symbiosis that took place when guys like Butterfield and Bloomfield were on the front lines learning the blues became beneficial to both the old masters and the young turks. With the aid of guys like Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, white blues players gained both invaluable on-stage experience as well as the acceptance and grudging respect of black blues aficionados. What the old masters gained was access to the ears and to the purchasing power of millions of young white kids who would otherwise have remained largely ignorant of the blues scene.<br /><br />Fathers and Sons is one of the fruits born of that symbiotic relationship. Though both Bloomfield and Butterfield died young, they are still looked at today as titans of the blues renaissance of the late 1960s. As for Muddy Waters and Otis Spann, what real blues fan is not hugely familiar with their work? Throw in old session stalwarts Donald Dunn, Sam Lay and Buddy Miles and you have the ingredients for a smash album.<br /><br />I don't really have any favorites here, yet there is not a single song I dislike. For a measly ten bucks or so, the listener gets not only the original album, but also four songs not on the original. Those who hadn't heard the album yet will find on listening that they are probably familiar with a few of the cuts that have been covered by others.<br /><br />In retrospect, Fathers and Sons stands as one of the great albums of the 1960s. If you like the blues, particularly of the Chicago strain, then you should own this.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|I WILL SAY IT IS GOOD ENOUGH TO WATCH BUT AFTER YOU ARE INVESTED IN THE STORY <br />AND BEGIN TO INVOLVE YOURSELF WITH THE CHARATERS YOU WONDER WHY THEY DELETED SCENES  <br />WHICH I THOUGHT HELPED ME AND THE END WAS VAGUE BECAUSE YOU START TO CARE ABOUT  <br />EACH ONE AND THEN IT JUST ENDS AND YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT ULTIMATELY HAPPENS TO <br />THIS FAMILY?

B000NA1OXY|5.0|<br /> <br />Well, I got my hands on a preview copy of this new album from Avril Lavigne and I must say WOW! I liked her 2 previous albums a lot, but this is so far the best one ...  <br /> <br />This album is about FUN and I bet that Avril had a very good time doing it!  <br /> <br />'Girlfriend' <br />We all know this one, so I just say I really love this song, even though when I heard it first I was kinda \\"shocked\\" (as probably most of us) but then it just grow on me, it's not some stupid teenage pop it goes deep and deeper the more I listen to it ... ***** <br /> <br />'I Can Do Better' <br />Up tempo catchy song bringing back feelings from \\"Complicated\\" album, totally different then 'Girlfriend', when those who don't like 'Girlfriend' will just feel relieved and say old Avril is back ... ***** <br /> <br />'Runaway' <br />Now this is a real treat, amazing up tempo catchy song one of the best Avril has ever written! This must be a single! ***** <br /> <br />'The Best Damn Thing' <br />The beginning is like yet another cheerleader song, but then - such an amazing chorus ... It also has so funny lyrics (\\"I hate it when a guy doesn't understand why a certain time of month, I don't want to hold his hand ...\\") LOL! It's so funny! And the way hows Avril singing this one is just so great!! ***** <br /> <br />'When You're Gone' <br />This one I still cannot listen on public ... It's heartbreaking ... So beautiful! And Avril's voice is just amazing! I always feel like I want this song last forever and never end ... Best ever ballad from Avril ... Next single! ***** <br /> <br />'Everything Back But You' <br />Another up tempo song, one of my favourite! I love it, great funny lyrics ... <br /> <br />'Hot' <br />Probably the best song, amazing, catchy, fabulous ... I can't get enough of this one ... It's not enough to just listen to it, I'm feeling like I have to \\"eat\\" it ... The \\"Baby Baby\\" won't leave my head for a very long time ... Next single! *****  <br /> <br />'Innocence' <br />Another beautiful ballad ... Powerful song, stunning lyrics which reminds me a part of my life, so this song is also very personal for me ... ***** <br /> <br />'I Don't Have To try' <br />Avril is singing about her pants, maybe first song I won't like? No no \\"somehow\\" it's yet another favourite ... She use high pitched voice when singing \\"I don't care what you're saying I don't care what you're thinking\\" and it's so cool! ***** <br /> <br />'One Of Those Girls' <br />Seems kinda average with no strong melody ... I like the lyrics though ... (Blond girls with blue eyes won't like this one) LOL <br />Then there's goes the \\"between chorus\\": <br />(You know it's a game, you know it's a game She keeps playing around with your head, playing around with your head She's so insane, so insane She's the one to blame, she's the one to blame) and suddenly it's a pretty good song! ***** <br /> <br />'Contagious' <br />I like hows Avril singing in this one especially \\"out of my mind\\" part, she has such a great voice! ***** <br /> <br />'Keep Holding On' <br />We all know know this song, we all love it, nothing more to say ... ***** <br /> <br /> <br />To sum up, I can't help it, but I like this album the best! It's happy, funny, catchy and if Avril had decided to go to this direction I'm with her 100%!  <br /> <br />The best thing is that Avril really tried to come up with a great album, when all the songs has some value and I can tell the more I listen the more I love it!  <br /> <br />I'm glad she's not like the artists who just put 2 maybe 3 good songs on album and the rest just \\"fills up\\" the space ... (coz people are downloading just the singles on iTunes anyway, so why bother) <br /> <br />Awesome album, 5 stars!   <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000NDIAWO|2.0|i am an honestly big fan of beyonce. i have both of her cds and have always loved destiny's child. i even love her new song \\"beautiful liar\\". but i think that it is illogical for her to re-release this album, escpecially since releasing it in april defeats the purpose of naming the album \\"Bday\\" because her birthday is in september. but still, i can't help but love her new song. and i think that she did a great job with shakira. it is an unlikely collabo between two of the most successful artists of the decade, which makes it a great song. but shakira totally steals the spotlight with her stronger voice. i think this track should belong to shakira and she could use it as one of her tracks for her next album.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|The first time I saw this film was a copy of a copy of a Korean bootleg...and it was still good enough that I went out and bought the directors cut seen here.
B000FOQ0TG|5.0|Anyone reading these pages already agrees that the OPERATION MINDCRIME album by QUEENSRYCHE is a true metal masterpiece.  Arguably their best even those others might site EMPIRE as superior but I think that is lunacy.  The Mindcrime album holds a very special place in my heart.  The summer that it was released or at least when I discovered it was not one of my best.  I played the vinyl album (remember those?) daily until I wore it out.  I never thought that an album could be played until its death but I found this out and had to buy another copy.  I saw the tour for this when they opened for Metallica and did only a few songs from this plus other live favorites in about a 50 minute set.  I have since bought this on cassette and CD.  I have seen the VHS LIVECRIME years back and unfortunately, that did not hold my interest as much as the videos.  OK, I hear you, get to the point.  I found this collection and have to admit, it has everything that a Queensryche/Operation Mindcrime could ask for.  Remastered original studio album, how can that ever get a less than 5 rating?  New London live version which I think sounds better than the LiveCrime CD released a few years back.  4 ½ stars.  Third disc is the videos.  I like this so much more than seeing them perform this masterpiece live. The videos give the fan a view of what the band was thinking about with their presentation on film of the true concept of \\"OPERATION MINDCRIME\\".  Using Dr. X and Nicky with news clips other than band miming still makes for a more energetic and enjoyable view.  Some may complain about 5.1 sound and all that but I think this is the deluxe treatment, remastered studio, entire album performed live and videos.  If you are a Queensryche fan, you will buy this and enjoy it.  It may not be perfect but it is a great package!  I just wish Mindcrime 2 would have been better.  A new assassination plan with modern day terrorists or a story line like something from the show 24 would have been much better than thinking Nicky would be let out of jail and try and continue a story that really ended with Eyes of a Stranger.  My thoughts.r than thinking Nicky would be let out of jail and try and continue a story that really ended with Eyes of a Stranger.  My thoughts.
B000000W5N|4.0|Their best album.  And my favorite album of all.  But one star goes away for not remastering this one as they have the CD's of the early years.  Surely it is deserving.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|As D. Vance already stated before, the US Discovery Channle version has the lady from Alien, instead of David Attenborough.  I guess they needed to go patriotic with an American.  She's a great actress, but unfortunately, she isn't a narrator.  Her voice really doesn't belong.  In fact, when she speaks, your mind expects Aliens 3 to begin.   <br /> <br />Regardless of my opinion of the narrator, this documentary is the best ever produced.  My wife and I have been watching it on Discovery HD Theater and I feel sorry for those without HD.  If you don't have HD, get it.  YOU ARE MISSING OUT!  I tried watching a SD broadcast and I couldn't.  It was like playing Circus Maximus on Atari 2600 with a joystick.  I can't wait for HD-DVD or BR-DVD to become standard.  I will definitely get this series on either format then and hold out on buying the SD-DVD version... I doubt even 480p (progressive scan) will do this justice.  Luckily, I have HD PVR from Time Warner and will likely hold onto these for a very long time.   <br /> <br />So far, the best two series is the Deep Oceans and Ice Worlds episodes.  My wife was crying watching the emperor penguins struggle to keep their chick alive.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|This could have been a smarmy National Lampoon style effort, but instead I think they pulled it off beautifully.<br /><br />Funny, yet sobering in its accuracy. Watch, laugh and wince.<br /><br />Yep. This is the point we've come to, folks. Truth is a four letter word, and may the best B.S.er win.<br /><br />Check out the America: Living in Spin featurette.

B000NA28I4|4.0|I have read both Eragon and the Eldest.  The movie did a good job of bringing Eragon to life.  While somethings were not explained or explored the bond between Eragon and Saphria are  conveyed in a touching manner.  Saphrira's pain from the attack of the demon dragon was very heartwrenching, even though I know she would survive it was still a kleenex moment.  The ending gave way to a possible 2nd movie leading to The Eldest.  All in all, I enjoyed the movie and plan to add it to my DVD collection
B000J10EQU|3.0|\\"Superman Returns\\" starts off well - we quickly move through a lot of Superman's back story, because the filmmakers know we've all seen Christopher Reeve's original \\"Superman.\\"  Indeed, the theme music is the same; Brando's footage and voice as Superman's father are repurposed; this movie clearly acknowledges that the first Superman movie happened and is meant to be placed in the same universe.  Brandon Routh does a credible Christopher Reeve; Kevin Spacey maintains the same tone as Hackman did in the original; and indeed the tone of the picture is very much that of the original \\"Superman.\\"<br /><br />So why three stars?  First, there just isn't much of a story in this movie.  The first one wasn't a masterpiece of storytelling, but it had plot aplenty compared to this.  Second, \\"Superman Returns\\" lacks the iconic moments of the first movie that you remember even years after seeing the film.  Third, this movie isn't so much about Superman as it is about Lois Lane.  My wife pointed this out, and she's right.  Not that Lois Lane isn't an interesting or worthwhile character, but we want to see a movie about Superman when we are watching \\"Superman Returns.\\"  Instead, Superman is the cipher at the center of this film, a sort of Oliver Twist around whom all manner of events happens, but whom we never really get to know.<br /><br />It's worth a rent, and it's better than Superman III or Superman IV.
B000MV9026|5.0|After avoiding the movie in the theatres due to negative, UNINFORMED reviews that the movie showed a blown up church and cross floating in the water, a gay penguin, and immorality, my 7 and 8 year old children and I watched the movie this weekend.  We loved it!  They watched it three times in one weekend.  My son truly believes that they filmed talking penguins.  None of the negatives that were in the Internet messages circulating a few months ago were true -- it was one giant hoax. <br /> <br />Mumble is different, but he's not gay -- he has a girlfriend, Gloria.  His difference is that he can't sing like the other penguins; he dances instead.  He is shunned for this until he saves the day with his dancing.  My son has been teased about wearing glasses, and he absolutely related to this part of the movie.  They also were fascinated by the leopard seal, and we spent an hour reading more about them, making this quite educational. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a good family movie with great music and dancing!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband who is a Hugh Grant fan and knew that he had enjoyed this movie when we saw it in the theater.  Although I seldom watch a movie more than once, especially one I wasn't that crazy about the first time, I decided to watch it with him again during the Holiday break.  Well, I must have been in a bad mood during the first viewing because I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  It is a must for Hugh Grant fans!
B000N3ST7K|4.0|Once again, director Quentin Tarantino brings us a collection of forgotten treats for his latest movie's soundtrack. Opening with the throttle filled Last Race from composer Jack Nitzsche, I felt that I was going to be in for a ride. I don't find all the tracks to be pure gems, and the usual dialogue spots sort of get in the way, but some of these are worth ever penny and more. Eddie Floyd, a Stax regular, and Joe Tex bring the soul during their joint-juke scene, making you want to cry out your love's name. Smith's cover of Baby It's You outdoes the Shiriles' standard, and is the real hard-to-find long-lost track. The Dave, Dee, Dozy... track, Hold Tight, is great english mod, and lives up to its introduction from the movie's sexy DJ. The movie's closing track, April March's Chick Habit is a swinging, sleezy french-pop gem that borrows itself into the skull (at least mine)like the first time I heard the 5,6,7,8's (until Vonage started using it in their adds, ruining the insanly fun go-go tune). Although I don't enjoy the whole thing, these tracks make-up for any disappointment, and will become a favorite in my library.
0385751060|3.0|I just finished reading this book with my children (age 10 and 13). The book is important and reasonably well-written. It provides a good medium for discussing the Holocaust with kids, but I think it has some disturbing flaws.  <br /> <br />Bruno, the main character, is only 9, and he has an innocence that is taken too far. I think that if I was Jewish, I would be offended by the idea that this boy's parents were so involved in the evil that was the Auschwitz, and somehow not spewing hateful, anti-semetic rhetoric in their daily lives. Somehow this boy, despite a year of friendship with a little boy in the concnetration camp, just never made the leap of understanding that he was living in a family of people who were perpetrating hatred.  <br /> <br />His father is a Commandant, and to truly talk to our children about the Holocaust, I believe it is important to explain to them how hateful the fuhrer and his soldiers were. No child could be raised under the tutelage of such a high-ranking soldier, and not be aware of the hate and the brutality that lived within his home. He may have been raised to admire it, but he could never have been oblivious. Not even at age 9. Children are far more perceptive than adults, and could never maintain this hopelessly self-absorbed innocence for more that a year. It just went too far. <br /> <br />I also think that although it is brilliant marketing by the publisher not to include a summary in the front of the book, it is dangerous and somewhat irresponsible. This is a book that you should read WITH your children...make no mistake that it needs to be discussed and explained. When I read the brief \\"sell\\" on the inside front cover, I could make the leap that it was about the Holocaust, but the references are veiled and confusing, and even though my kids are gifted readers at the top of their respective classes, they would have been confounded, and perhaps even upset by the writing. That's okay, as long as I'm there reading it with them.<br /> <br />I'm sure the purpose of providing a mysterious introduction is to sell more books, and get over the problem of people saying, \\"I don't want to read a book about this depressing subject.' Again, great marketing and probably effective, but misleading and unfair to parents who are trying to pick appropriate subject matter for their kids.
B000M4RG42|4.0|Very well done movie about something most of us know nothing about - three of the soldiers who raised the flag on Iwo Jima being brought back to the states for a nationwide patiotism rally to raise money for WWII.  Great performances by all - especially Adam Beach.
B000BI0WOA|4.0|This is more of a Dire Straits collection than a Mark Knopfler CD, but who cares. MK always remained true to the DS sound, even with the latter day country tunes. A nice CD for any DS and/or MK fan.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|I can't say anything negative about this CD.  Everything from the song selection to the remastering is great.  One of the best features is the fact it was remastered by Eddie Kramer, the original sound engineer for Jimi, and the superb sound quality really shows.  RIP Jimi.
B00008H2LB|5.0|My music taste runs from deep house, techno and chill-out to rock (like 311, Helmut and Paw), Brit pop and some recent bands like Mutemath. And yet I seem to always return to Linkin Park, loving their blend of musical styles (heavy, electronic, hip-hop) and the band's raw energy. That energy is embodied in lead singer Chester Bennington, whose vocals range from liquid sweetness to soaring power. LP guitars, while sometimes dismissed as repetitive power chords, are highly appropriate for this music and VERY well done (It's also about the sound that guitarist Brad Delson gets; he's one cool dude). Moreover, LP are gifted songwriters and have very good ideas of melody; they have my full respect!
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Thank you!  This is the version everyone has been waiting for - all the scenes in wide-screen theater format - all the dialog is back - no more awkward, out-of-place close-ups.  It was a joy to sit and watch as it was intended, to share with my wife and kids.  I was amazed that even some of the hidden, background, dialog, by Ching especially, has been brought back.   <br />Frankly, it was worth the wait for Hollywood to get it right.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|The Holiday is the perfect movie to watch after you just finish a relationship, because it gives hope to men and women that there is a special someone for them. The movie is about two women trying to get over their last relationship and to do so they switching houses for the holidays. During the switch the two girls find the meaning of real love. In Iris's (Kate Winslet) case she was still in love with her ex that had left her for another woman, sometimes as women we tend to hold on to things that make us feel happy for moments but at the same times makes very unhappy. While Iris is in California she finds a new friend, a 90 year old man who advices her that by holding on to a friendship with her ex and that now takes advantage of her feeling towards him for his own benefit, is only hurting her. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) in the other side of the world finds a Graham (Jude Law) a man who has trouble showing who he really is; she discovers that is her problem too, and in the short time they spend together they find a way to be happy with themselves.  Iris finds Miles (Jack Black), who is going through something very similar to what she went through and helps him to solve it, and at the end get together.  Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet make this movie great. They both shine equally and neither tries to steal the limelight. This is one of the first roles that Kate has done as a comedy and it she does it very well.  If you want to lighten up your personal emotional baggage, set your life in perspective, here is movie that might just do that for you. Give it a try.
