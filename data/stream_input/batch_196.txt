B000002J0B|5.0|This is a very variety-filled album. Led Zeppelin sure know how to make a great album. They still had much to do with music also. The Song Remains the Same is a great mid-tempo classic, which has great singing from Plant. The Rain Song has a pleasent feeling which gets me sleppy. Not boring at all, just peaceful. Over The Hills and Far Away starts out as a folky tune, then an all-out rocker before returning to quit acoustics. The real shiner on the album. The Crunge is real funk, and intentionally funny. Well, the bass line reminds me of the Fat Albert theme. But can anyone explain to me at the end where Plant goes &quot;Where's that confounded bridge?&quot; Anyway, the next track is Dancing Days, and it combines Indian and rock influnces. Nice song. Dyer Maker is the only track that's not so great. It doesn't aound like them. Cool reggae variation, though. No Quarter has asome amazing jazz influnces. Very dark. And finally, The Ocean. Pure concentrated fun. Great album.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|To Prince & the NPG:<BR>Props & pounds on the most long awaited & honest work to date<BR>As for the listeners:<BR>(...)!<BR>(...)  This work has been a long time coming.  (...) <BR>This album is straight up beautiful.  It's a different Prince than you are used to for sure.  More fusion here than ever (maybe a little too much in some places - my only complaint.)He's way more open lyrically & T-I-G-H-to the T on production! <BR>The Rainbow Children picks up where Lovesexy left off.  I take the storyline as part diary/part vision/part testimony.  I dig the albums that you can't quite digest the first time.  <BR>(...) (...)<BR>I couldn't begin to pick favs.  It's an album that needs to be heard in its entirity. (...)  Real music & talent representin on The Rainbow Children. It's the funk for real.  Pick it up if that's what you're after. <BR>(...)
B000002J09|5.0|No, it's not because of &quot;Stairway&quot;, it's because of the whole album. Each song has it's own life and is so complex, you know that they took their time with each song. Jon Bonham proves to create new ideas, with the unbeliveable drumming sound on &quot;When The Levee Breaks.&quot; To me, that's their Stairway. Rock n' Roll and Black Dog are amazing too. Very good bluesy stuff. Battle Of Evermore is a really good folish song. It influnced a lot of power metal, but this is the starter. Stairway to Heavenn, however good it may be, is overrated. It's great, but not their best. Oh well, get this great album. You won't be sorry.
6300215512|4.0|Title of Film:  Sunset Boulevard<BR>Year Released:  1950<BR>Running time:   110 minutes long<BR>Director/studio:  Billy Wilder/Paramount Studio<BR>Actors/Actresses:  William Holden/Gloria Swanson<br />Joe Gillis is experiencing writer's block as this black &amp; white movie begins.  He owes money on his car and tries to fool two men who have come calling for the car.  When Joe takes the car out later on he sees the two men and decides to drive the other direction.  As he does he happens upon a mansion that is run-down and unkept.  The garage door is up so he pulls in to hide his only possession -- his car. <br />As he enters the mansion, Max the butler, thinks he has come to help bury the lady of the house's pet monkey.  Joe does not immediately correct this notion.  Rather, he jaunts up the stairs and discovers Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) grieving over the loss of her monkey.  <br />Joe recognizes Norma and now the plot thickens.  Norma is a has-been in Hollywood.  She is old and has had several men in her life.  She snags Joe into staying and begins a one-sided affair with him even though he is enjoying his new lifestyle.<br />He eventually decides to break away from Norma and she becomes bitterly jealous.  He sneaks out at night to meet his friend's fiance (who he has feelings for) and begins collaboration on a book with her.<br />Norma can't stand the thought of losing her newest status symbol and lover.  So, when Joe walks out she shoots him in the back with a pistol and kills him.<br />This movie was narrated by Joe and had some flashbacks.  It was a fun movie to watch.  I really enjoyed the banter between Swanson and Holden.  It was fun!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This is by far one of my all time favorites! I have watched it numerous times on TCM, pretty much whenever it's on. This is definitly a must see for people of all ages. I hope it's out on DVD soon, I'll be the first in line!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I saw the previews for this movie and couldn't help but want to watch it.<br />This movie starts out... pretty much poking fun at your classic fairy tale creatures. With Mike Meyers (austin powers), Eddie Murphy (Dr. Dolittle), Cameron Diaz (Charlie's Angels) and John Lithgow (3rd Rock from the Sun) paired in this movie it is a must see! The comedy is priceless. <br />Shrek, an ogre with a big heart, and a faithful side-kick (who he is trying to ditch) they set out to save Shrek's swamp/home by rescueing a princess. <br />It is a great film for both kid's and adults, with enough humor to keep both laughing through the film. <br />I *highly* recommend this if you are looking for a good laugh.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie makes me laugh so hard everytime I see it. The dancing sequences are the best.
0782008372|1.0|Funny that mjkobb said in his/her review of this DVD that it may make you think something was wrong with your player...  I actually bought this disc at the same time I bought my player...  And I was horrified, HORRIFIED by what I saw.  Worse, by far, than even my well-worn VHS copy!  I actually had to go rent some other DVD's to make sure that it was the disc, not the player.<br />I was very pleased that subsequent rentals and disc purchases showed me that it was merely a bad transfer.  Highlander is one of my all-time favorite films, but the DVD version is so bad that it looks like it was edited by a five year old with a box of crayons.  This disc needs to be redone...  And the only way I can recommend you buying it is if you have very bad eyesight or if it is cheap.  REALLY cheap, like five bucks.
B00005QCVT|5.0|This movie is evidence that &quot;Marketing Is King&quot;<br />Traffic is the worst movie I have seen, especially considering all the hype and oscars.<br />This movie is the one of the best from Hollywood. Not only did Ellen Burystn merit an Oscar ... but they should use her scenes as a teaching tool for future students of acting.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br />But don't watch it with your younger than 18 kids.
B00003CXXR|3.0|Usually film series degrade as they progress through sequel after sequel, but I would say that the Jurassic Park films are the exception. Perhaps my thinking is skewed because I went to the original Jurassic Park with such high expectations, and was let down, but went to JP III expecting a stinker, and well, it was a watchable film.<br />Most of the credit for the film's watchability goes to Trevor Morgan, a rare child actor who neither mugs for the camera nor delivers cute one-liners written by a screenwriter who has no idea how adolescents talk. Frankly, I was a little bored until he appeared, then the film picked up; he injected some life into it, even managing to act and react among adults who were giving less than sterling performances.<br />William H. Macy plays boring middle aged monotone guy that made him famous-- not to be confused with his occasion turns as shouting angry middle aged guy. This is all he's expected to do, and he delivers.<br />Tea Leoni is completely wasted. She is a fine comic actress, and G-d knows this film could have used a little comic relief, but as there is none in the script, she has little to do besides be shrill and whiny. Poor Leoni seems to realize how ridiculous her character is, and just can't help occasionally stepping outside her, just to let us know she knows. A fatal mistake, but I suppose better than letting people think you think you're delivering serious Oscar material.<br />Sam Neill squints at things, and makes lots of scientific pronouncements, and is believable if not compelling. For me, he will never do anything better than My Brilliant Career, though, so it's useless for me to comment on his performance.<br />The CGI is as good as ever, I suppose, although I never did get a good perspective on the sail-back dinosaur. I couldn't figure out how big it was supposed to be. At first it seemed at big as the T-rex, in their confrontation scene, then later, there's this jaw shot, where it seems to have a very long neck, but not such a big body; at the end it is huge, a real monster. But all the eyes were good; the dinosaurs had penetrating gazes that were quite frightening. To be able to achieve that effect of real eye contact is quite an attainment.<br />I don't really know how many people see these movies for the plot, per se. Isn't the plot really an excuse to show off the special effects? In this film, the writers have abandoned all pretense of science (all that ridiculous DNA frog fiction in the original film, e.g.), and made a fantasy. I enjoyed that much more.<br />I hope Trevor Morgan gets some kind of special Oscar.
B00005214X|5.0|Even if this is so, we miss you already, George.
B00005214X|5.0|George Harrison died yesterday and I wanted to review &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, his greatest album.  Almost every song on this is a classic...well maybe not the &quot;bonus tracks&quot;.  It begins with &quot;I'd have you Anytime&quot; a great mellow love song co-written with Bob Dylan, then launches into My Sweet Lord, a great spiritual catharsis that tries to create a symbiosis of Eastern and Western religion (Hallelujah/Hare Krishna).  Then Wah-Wah, another heavy upbeat track, then Isn't it a Pity (how we cause each other pain) pretty much sums up his enlightened Eastern vision.  What is Life? is a great rocker, but the lyrics are disappointing if you are looking for the answer.  &quot;If not for You&quot; is a touching rendition of a Dylan tune.  Let it Down another powerful intense rocker.  Beware of Darkness another great insightful song.  You will notice the originals are far superior to the new versions.  Apple Scruffs a bit of lighthearted fun.  Awaiting on you All is close to My Sweet Lord in intensity, even if I have a problem with the lyric &quot;you dont need no visas, before you can see Jesus&quot;.  Then All Things Must Pass....so true. &quot;I Dig Love&quot; is the most Beatlesque track on the album, and &quot;Art of Dying&quot; an admirable effort to delve into the subject of Death.<br /><br />  It's Johnny's Birthday is the Pythonesque track...something you'd hear on Dr. Demento.  Then the 3rd disc is one massive jam session...great 1970 feel to it.  This record is a must for any fan of classic rock.<br />  I spent today thinking of George, the incredible impact he and the other Beatles had on my life.  But George did not fear death...he knew he would live eternally.
B00004Z459|5.0|this is one of maybe 2 or 3 cd's i own that i actually like all the songs.  linkin park definitely has a unique sound.  hybrid theory has great lyrics and music that gets you pumped.  i'm glad i got it.
B00003CX8J|5.0|This movie is now one of my favorites. With A wonderful cast who all gave great performances, this movie is a must have for fans of the comics and anyone who enjoys movies.
B0000019PA|4.0|A little like Cake energy-wise, but folkier and with more passion. Technically, not a great voice - but who's complaining. (I've never minded Neil Young's vocal shortcomings either). A fresh sounding, uncompromising and idiosyncratic work.
B000000OU6|5.0|This album is hands down one of the best rock albums I own.  I dont care if everyone disagrees me.  Everyone seems to have a problem with the vocalist (Eric Dover) but he's not that bad at all.  The man's edgy, rough style fits with every song.  I was actually quite impressed.  Words cannot describe Slash's guitar play.  People say that he was trying to recreate GNR, but thats just HIS style.  GNR was based around his guitar play just as Snakepit is.  In my opinion this album is better than the new Snakepit album.  Dont get me wrong, the new album rocks, but it doesn't have as much solo time for Slash.  Anyway, buy this album, its well worth every penny.
0553208845|5.0|As a final year philosophy student at a British university much of the philosophy I have studied has been Western orthodox with no Eastern philosophy on the syllabus. For that reason this book was a breath of fresh air. If you want to widen your horizons, to envelop new ideas, thoughts and philosophies this book is a must. It brings together western and eastern traditions of thought and in doing so it serves to open up the mind.<br />It is a story about an individuals quest but ultimately the quest is a universal one. At some stage in Siddharthas journey we will all recognize ourselves, and hopefully we will heed the wisdom that lies within the book. A wisdom that doesn't consist in offering us a set of pre-packaged rules for living our lives, rather it is a wisdom that insists on our listening to and in following our hearts, in accepting the flow and ebb of life. It suggests that we can all  perceive the unity which runs throughout our lives, that in time we will see that true harmony requires a plurality of notes. There are aspects of this book which refer to that which has no name. Siddhartha's experience at the river reflects Hesse's unwillingness to communicate this to us, indeed the subject matter requires that it be inexpressible.  There are no recognizable directions or maps which will take us there,  it is a condition of our experiencing it that we find it within ourselves.<br />&quot;Truth must be lived not taught.<br />It is not found in theories and books.&quot;<br />It is found within.<br />What lives within is near, all other things are far away.<br />Everyday is full, yet somewhat inexpressible.<br />The water<br />Not just water<br />&quot;But...the voice of life.<br />The voice of Being.<br />Perpetually Becoming.&quot;<br />Ever changing.<br />The water continually flows, and yet it is always there.<br />It is always the same, and yet every moment it is anew.<br />Prevailing over the sequence of ripples,<br />Where we glide and sail,<br />Buoyant.<br />Rising and falling with the waves,<br />In the rain of aeons<br />Water washed and unexplained objects come to stay.<br />Exotic things.<br />Underline their solitude,<br />In the flux of melodies, played eternally in foreign harbours.<br />Composed of notes; high and low.<br />Melodies as soft as...<br />Tears<br />Falling as...water<br />The river knows everything.<br />There is no such thing as time.<br />The river, it is everywhere<br />&quot;At the source and at the mouth,<br />At the waterfall,<br />At the current,<br />At the fountains<br />In the ocean and in the mountains&quot;<br />In all places, at all times.<br />Binding.<br />Sea-breath, shall whisper...<br />The creatures it enfolds<br />Are related to the things they knew as human.<br />Only the present exists for it.<br />Not the shadow of the past<br />Or the spectre of the future.<br />Seperated only by shadows not by reality<br />Carefree, serene, secure from injury.<br />The water.<br />Not just water.<br />&quot;But...the voice of life.<br />The voice of Being.<br />Perpetually Becoming.&quot;<br />Ever changing<br />Beneath the silent cycle of the stars.<br />Reflecting the flux<br />Still.<br />Yet changing.with the waves,<BR>In the rain of aeons<BR>Water washed and unexplained objects come to stay.<BR>Exotic things.<BR>Underline their solitude,<BR>In the flux of melodies, played eternally in foreign harbours.<BR>Composed of notes; high and low.<BR>Melodies as soft as...<BR>Tears<BR>Falling as...water<br />The river knows everything.<BR>There is no such thing as time.<BR>The river, it is everywhere <BR>&quot;At the source and at the mouth,<BR>At the waterfall,<BR>At the current,<BR>At the fountains<BR>In the ocean and in the mountains&quot;<BR>In all places, at all times.<br />Binding.<br />Sea-breath, shall whisper...<BR>The creatures it enfolds<BR>Are related to the things they knew as human.<BR>Only the present exists for it.<br />Not the shadow of the past<BR>Or the spectre of the future.<BR>Seperated only by shadows not by reality<BR>Carefree, serene, secure from injury.<br />The water.<BR>Not just water.<BR>&quot;But...the voice of life.<BR>The voice of Being.<BR>Perpetually Becoming.&quot;<BR>Ever changing<BR>Beneath the silent cycle of the stars.<BR>Reflecting the flux<BR>Still.<BR>Yet changing.
B00004XOWM|4.0|People complaining about bad words?!?! That's why they warn you about it on the front of the CD!  <BR>Limp Bizkit is the best band I have ever heard of. They have dropped in quality a bit since their debut but they're still kickin'.  My only problem is how in some of the songs(The Secret track after I think it'll be okay) Durst gets a high pitched voice. Buy this CD.  Enjoy it.
B00004Z459|2.0|They have a little talent but it's all washed away by the completely annoying voice of the lead and backup singer.  Squeaky.  I bet this guy could pass up for a second for one of the backstreet boys.  Don't even think about buying it.  Go for something real like Staind, Limp Bizkit, or Korn.  That's all I have to say about it.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Some reveiwers are complaining about missing favourite tracks - Sgt Pepper, Drive My Car etc.  Well if you read the CD booklet you'll see that this is a collection (in chronological order) of the Beatles singles that reached Number 1 on the British and US charts, so by definition many favourites could not be included.  The amazing thing about The Beatles is that not only did they have 27 number 1 hits but that so many of their great songs were only ever album tracks (for example, no singles were released from Sgt Pepper or the White album).  How many other artists can claim to have had 27 hits - let alone number 1 hits?<br />So enjoy this collection for what it is, and if your favourite isn't here - get the album!
1859849296|5.0|In swift and sly prose, Hitchens relates his personal observations of Mother Teresa's clinics in Calcutta. He tells one story of a nursery full of starving, sick babies crying in insufficient cribs, which M. Teresa describes as the way &quot;we fight abortion.&quot; He writes of men dying of AIDS, denied pain medicine, because according to M. Teresa, their suffering will assure them of ultimate salvation. Paitients too weak to object are baptized in their final hours.<br />I have now doubt that all of this is true, and at first glance it is surprising, but it shouldn't be. M. Teresa is a Roman Catholic nun and Mother Superior; in fact, founder of an order. She is not merely Christian in a vague way, but a zealot for Catholicism. I knew this-- in fact I even knew that at one point, all she allowed her nuns was an impoverished diet of rice, and insufficient calories of that, because she thought they should the same thing as the people they served. This was not necessary, as her order had plenty of money. She began feeding her nuns a living diet only after the Pope ordered her to do so.<br />I suppose as a Catholic nun and zealot, she's did a fine job, but I don't think most Americans, especially non-Catholic Americans, knew this. Every year, millions of dollars are donated to her order, most of which sits in banks, while patients in her hospitals suffer from insufficient care. Some of this money comes from non-Catholic Americans who know next to nothing about M. Teresa and her actual mission. All people know is some vague idea that there's a lot of hunger and inadequate medical care in Calcutta, and M. Teresa order is doing something out there to help.<br />Christopher Hitchens lets people know exactly what she did; anyone who reads this book will never blindly donate money on the assumption that since there's poverty in Calcutta, any money sent to charity workers there must be doing some good.<br />More than exposing her clinics, Hitchens shows the disingenuous way M. Teresa has presented herself to the world. There is here in the book reprinted a very quaintly written letter on behalf of Charles Keating(!) reprinted here, yet plenty examples of her savvy that belie the innocent charm of her letter.<br />Hitchens does not hide his distaste for his subject, and while it is easy to accuse him of less than objectivity, he does stick to the facts; he just reports them with biting, venomous words. If you are a fan of M. Teresa, this book will offend you. If you seek the truth about her, you must read this book. If you have always harbored doubts about her, but never had any real evidence, this book will be a great relief, as your gut feeling is confirmed.
B00005QIPH|5.0|How long has it been since you've been absolutely blown away by a new cd - one where it takes only one listen to get into?  it seems like it's been a long, long time...until Is This It?  if you've found yourself mumbling about the current state of music in general and miss the days of intelligent, talented bands like the replacements and husker du, buy this cd!  there's hope afterall.  and you will not be disappointed.

0451526295|3.0|I love classical literature, and I am a big Austen fan. This book was not up to the standard I expected of the author.<br />On the plus side, the characters are engaging. Austen does a good job of helping the reader understand who everyone is and has a clear grasp of their motivations. I found it interesting that I liked all the main characters. I really empathized with Fanny's unrequited love for Edmund, and I understood why she was so passive, even though I often didn't like her passivity. The chapters were short and the book was easy to read.<br />The big problem was the book was far too long. Some sections could have clearly been shortened. The play was a necessary part of the plot, but it shouldn't have taken so long. I did find myself getting bored and frustrated at times. As I have found to be common with classical literature, the last half of the book was better the first. There were some characters who were underdeveloped to the point that I wish they hadn't been there - specifically Tom. Also found the section of Fanny's return to her family in Portsmouth a bit long. I found that I got confused at times; I needed to go back and read the introduction. The introduction, in my version, was only 2 pages, which was far too short.<br />In summary, this is a good book for anyone who enjoys the classis. It is a somewhat difficult read, so if you have never read Jane Austen before, I would suggest starting elsewhere - my reccommendation would be Emma.
B000001FS3|5.0|THE GOOD:<br />Basically, I see this album on two levels:<br />First, you have tracks 4 - 11, which are all excellent, diverse rock songs. Of these, I especially love &quot;Running to Stand Still,&quot; &quot;Red Hill Mining Town,&quot; &quot;In God's Country,&quot; and &quot;One Tree Hill,&quot; the last one an underrated (unless you're from New Zealand) lyrical gem. <br />Next, the first three track which are more than just excellent, they're unparalleled in rock. I can think of no better introductory crescendo than that of &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name,&quot; no better gospel song than &quot;I Still Haven't Found,&quot; and no better angsty love song than &quot;With or Without You.&quot; I think people will still be humming these songs a hundred years from now, along with the Beatles and Elvis.<br />THE BAD:<br />&quot;Trip Through Your Wires&quot; has grown on me, but it's the closest this album comes to filler.<br />&quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; is a classic U2 political song, but please don't listen to the ZooTV live version, because then you'll hear how unbelievable this song COULD have been if the Edge had the chops to pull it off back in 1987. Oh well...<br />THE VERDICT:<BR>It's a bonafide classic, folks. Die hard U2 fans will disagree, but honestly, this will always be the album that casual or non-fans associate with U2, for better or for worse. Me, I like the adventure and rawness of ACHTUNG BABY a bit more, but nothing beats JOSHUA TREE in terms of sheer beauty and timelessness.
B00005QK3W|4.0|I like this album a lot and thats why I give it 4 stars . Are all the songs excellent and historical ? of course not . But &quot;Shes given up talking &quot; is a wonderful song about a little girl who dont want to talk that really goes straight to the heart . &quot;From a lover to a friend &quot; is a pretty ballad,.&quot;Heather&quot; is a very well composed instrumental as &quot;I do&quot; is <BR>a nice song too. &quot;Ridin in Jaipur&quot; is a lovely theme. Mainly I give this record 4 stars cause Paul is taking risks doing what is less expected of him . He improvise , he sing in unexpected ways (Ive been a McCartney fan for years and some things that i have heard here have surprised me) . Hes doing things his way , bravo.
B00004TA41|5.0|In 1957 John Coltrane recorded his first masterpiece, Blue Train; in 1967, he recorded his last masterpiece, Interstellar Space.  Within 5 months of recording these duets with drummer Rashied Ali, he would die of liver cancer.<br />  Though it gets lumped with other &quot;late&quot;, post-1965 or avant-garde Coltrane recordings, this album sounds very little like any other Trane recording.  Even if you dislike Meditations or Ascension, there's a chance that you'll like this -- and vice versa.  The absence of Pharoah Sanders makes this record easier on the ears, and a lot less ferocious.  On the other hand people who love the hardcore intensity of stuff like Meditations or Sun Ship may find Interstellar Space to be a little too abstract or austere.  The absence of piano creates a lot of space, which may be a good or a bad thing depending on your tastes.<br />  There are still some similarities to Meditations, Sun Ship, etc. -- Coltrane's playing is very free, disregarding harmony and melody for sound.  The themes are short and range from serene beauty (&quot;Venus&quot;) to dense fury (&quot;Leo&quot;).  Though it might seem that this music is random or without structure, the order and structure are just in a different musical language.  In some parts, Coltrane is conducting a saxophone dialogue with himself.  <br />  I'm a fan of course, and must say that the music is unbelievable.  If you're a fan of Trane's saxophone playing, keep in mind that he just PLAYS on this album, with none of his abilities impaired in the least.  Rashied Ali is obviously not Elvin Jones, but he complements Trane perfectly and fuels his ideas.  As long as you know what you are getting into, this should be one of the first purchases if you want to explore Coltrane's late music.  And though very little of his other work sounds like it, the quartet sessions composing Stellar Regions and Expression come from the same time period.
B000008GEF|4.0|I suppose that &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is the seminole Harrison album. Maybe it's just me, but I've always thought it was simply too much and too long. More satisfying instead is &quot;Living in the Material World&quot;, the 1973 successor album to ATMP. &quot;Living&quot; is more coherent as an overall album, 11 tracks covering 45 min.<br />Best know is of course the lead-off track (and #1 single) &quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)&quot;. The overall theme of &quot;Living&quot; is found on &quot;Sue Me, Sue You Blues&quot;, where George agonizes over the seemingly omni-presence of lawyers. &quot;The Light That Has Lighted the World&quot; is a piano-lead ballad. &quot;Don't Let Me Wait Too Long&quot; is a beautiful love song, driven by accoustic guitars. The title track is the pivotal (and also the longest) track on the album, in which George despises the material world in which he grew famous while a Beatle. &quot;The Lord That Loves The One (That Loves The Lord)&quot; is the &quot;other side of the coin&quot; of the title-track, in which George urges us to loves the Lord, instead of materiality.<br />The last track is a foreboding &quot;That Is All&quot;. Hearing this song again, a few days after George's passing away, brings me goose bumps. &quot;That is all I'm waiting for/Your love and nothing more/And that is all&quot;... George Harrison has left us, but his music will live forever. &quot;Living in The Material World&quot; is George Harrison at peak musical creativity and in peace with himself and the Lord. BUY IT!
B000058983|5.0|Love are one of the most enigmatic bands in rock history, and rightfully so. Their first two albums only hinted at the songwriting genius that lurked inside Arthur Lee; &quot;Forever Changes&quot; manifested this gift.<br />Lee managed to weave sublime melodies together with lyrics that showed the darker side of the so called &quot;Summer of Love.&quot; 'Andmoreagain' and 'The Red Telephone' are two such songs which become more magical everytime one hears them. It was hardly a one man show though; guitarist Maclean had a couple of gems up his sleave in 'Alone Again Or' and 'Old Man.'<br />Put simply this is a rare album where the songs can stand on their own, but they are only elevated further when they are all played uninterrupted. Love disappeared after &quot;Forever Changes.&quot; but like the Beach Boys they managed to put together an absolutely flawless album before their principal songwriter lost the plot.<br />The remastering is well done, and the generous allocation of bonus tracks as well as the microscopically biographic liner notes make now the time to buy this relatively unknown gem.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This is a great movie, its a present day representation of American Graphiti and Gone in 60 seconds(1974) except with an import car craze. it shows how cars never go out of style and they are just represented differently, of course im a little bit more partial to a 1967 Shelby GT500, but this is definetly worth getting.
B000002TQV|4.0|This album was the first indication of the creative phenomenon that Radiohead were to become. While there were moments of great promise on their debut, &quot;The Bends&quot; showed that Radiohead were concerned with making music that pushed the boundaries of what commercially successful music was capable of accomplishing.<br />This is a guitar tour de force. Songs like 'Just (You Do It To Yourself)' and 'My Iron Lung' made Johnny Greenwood into a guitar god in Britain. Thom Yorke was beginning to truly blossom as a songwriter; 'Fake Plastic Trees,' High and Dry' and 'Street Spirit (Fade Out)' still stand up with the best Radiohead have conceived since.<br />This album is essential, not only as an important document from  the most influential band of their generation, but also as one of the best guitar based records ever put together.
B00003CXXJ|2.0|Cheesy.  The adult humor is stupid, and it makes it a bad influence on the kids.
6302824729|5.0|The first was good as well as this one in this film Daniel must travel too China with Mr Myagi .Anyhoo this movie is good .
B00005JKHP|2.0|I hadn't seen this movie in about 15 years and really couldn't remember why I didn't like it before.  I bought this hoping that I would be surprised and enjoy the movie.  I like all the star trek movies except for this one.  It puts me to sleep when i watch it.  It is bogged down with all the special effects they experimented with on this movie.  The shots in outer space are just too long and should have been cut down.  It seems like there are moments in the movie that last near 10 minutes with no dialog, but just the crew looking and reacting to what they see in space.  VERY BORING.  The dvd is nicely done with plenty of extras including deleted scenes, some of which would have made the movie more fun if included.  Don't waste your time with this movie, buy one of the other star trek movies instead.
B000059WH0|5.0|This is Toto's hard Rock album....Easily as good as any creed, Van Halen and Def Leppard. If you like any of the forementioned ... then go out and get this album! It has great guitars delivered to us by guru Steve Lukather and on top of that there are great keyboards, organ and piano parts by David Paich and excellent drums by Jeff Porcaro. In between the excellent rock riffs there are some beautiful ballads, three of my favourites 'Two Hearts', 'Only You' and 'The Other Side'.<BR>Great song writing by the band and some other contributers include Fee waybill (an excellent song writer) and Danny Krotchimar (I like his songs too). Highlights of the album include 'Kingdom of Desire' and 'How many times'. The words indicate a heartfelt look at life, also with 'never enough' and 'kick down the walls' comes that break free feeling. 'She knows the devil' sounds abit like Australia's INXS, a very cool, groovy slightly naughty song. And let's not forget the  instrumental 'Jake to the bone' ... this is rock fusion that shows the boys can really play their instruments! Get this album if you love great music, it Rocks :-)
B00005QK3W|5.0|What is wrong with people today? All these so called Macca fans won't leave the man alone. Sir Paul McCartney is an inspiration to the world and this album does nothing but enhance his reputation as one of the best writers/composers ever. Paul has found happiness in life again after the tragic passing of his much loved wife Linda and all people can do is slag him off for writing an album like DRIVING RAIN. Heather has obviously inspired Paul into writing again and for this the world should be eternally grateful. I am only 19 and have loved Paul McCartney since i can remember and i have never been dissapointed with an album of his yet and i am not with this one.<br />For any true Paul McCartney fans this is a must.
B00000JQFM|5.0|Surfing with the Alien is the finest instrumental guitar album I've clapped ears on.  Every song is a masterpiece.  The stuff Satriani can do on a guitar is amazing.  <br />Even though I've listened to it many, many times, my jaw still drops at his fretboard shenigans on tracks such as Ice 9, Always With Me, Always With You, Circles, Lords of Karma, Echo... This is certainly one of the best albums I own. <br />You really should buy 2 copies of it, one to listen to and one to keep in an air tight glass case to stick on your mantlepiece.  It really is that good!  I recommend this to anyone who wants to start off listening to instrumental rock.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki is amazing. He can direct offbeat, intimate masterpieces like *My Neighbour Totoro* and masterpieces of epic proportions like *Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind* (one my favorite ten movies of all times). *Princess Mononoke* belongs to the latter category:  it is a mythical allegory of man's relationship with nature, set in a medieval Japan filled with talking beasts, strange fairies with rotating heads, mystical deer and animal corpses animated by energetic, wriggling maggots.<br />I have always found that the better a movie is, the more speechless it will leave me. I once started writing a review for another of Miyazaki's masterpieces, *Kiki's Delivery Service*, but I never posted it because I was so intensely moved by his genius that I was not able to say anything articulate about it. This is sad, because I consider very few films to be as deserving of a good review as *Kiki*.<br />So I will let the five stars do their work of recommendation, and merely say that I personally consider Miyazaki (together perhaps with King Hu) the greatest moviemaker ever, and *¨Princess Mononoke* one of his highest achievements.
0385505833|1.0|Skipping Christmas is a disappointing, boring book, and that's a lot to say from a fan of John Grisham.  Its tone is grinchy, and what might have been funny comes off as simply a little dumb. The sarcastic, cynical tone is not balanced by any sense of redemption; even the gift given at the end of the story is not enough.  Blair proves herself to be a selfish, thoughtless child, and the way the neighborhood comes to the family's rescue on Christmas Eve is unconvincing; Luther Krank is no match for George Bailey.  Skip this one and read The Painted House instead!
B00005K3OT|2.0|I would not have rented *Chocolat* and would not have bothered to review it if it had not become such a sensation in Objectivist circles, after philosopher Leonard Peikoff declared : «This is the best movie I've seen in decades.»<br />As a former Objectivist who still sticks to a great deal of Rand's esthetic theory (if not much else), I was very curious to see this film, all the more so as Objectivist praise for movies is extremely rare and therefore tends to be quite reliable (I rather enjoyed early recommendations for instance, such as *Dangerous Beauty* and *October Sky*). Such enthusiastic praise from the highest Obejctivist authority - and a man who sells an 18-hour course on how to appreciate great drama- could only mean one thing : that *Chocolate* might reconcile me with an artform that gives me fewer and fewer memorable moments as years go by.<br />However, I found very little to praise in this manipulative little film, which did not seem to me to have anything great even by Objectivist standards. For one thing, like many books adapted from novels, it makes extensive use of voice-over, something which Rand specifically condemned as the very negation of drama in film (for an illustration of this, I recommend Scorcese's *Wise Guys*, whose inept script is so drowned in voice-over that one feels the movie never even starts.)<br />Of course, from an Objectivist point of view, *Chocolat* is good in that it has a theme (the opposition of catholicism and paganism) and is wholly integrated around it, down to its facile colour symbolism. But I suspect that what drew Peikoff's praise was not so much the dramatic skill evinced in the writing as the anti-catholic propaganda that infuses the whole film.<br />To believe *Chocolat*, Catholicism is a religion led by an autocratic buffoon, whose ministers are well-meaning but deluded simpletons, and the believers in which are a host of miserable souls to whom the pleasures of the flesh are sadistically and morbidly deniedin the name of a non-existent future life.<br />The film dramatizes the conflict between this religion and its secular foe by showing us a small French village of the 1950s which seems to have been drained of all its colour by a stifling, frigid religious authoritarianism. Into this lost village come two red riding hoods, red as the devil, a mother and child, who choose to open a chocolate store right at the beginning of Lent, a season where Catholics undergo voluntary deprivation in order to learn to strengthen their resistance to temptation.<br />Now the chocolates sold in this shop are no ordinary chocolates. Based on some forgotten, occult meso-American knowledge, they seem to combine all the effects of modern drugs, from Prozac to Viagra, bringing back life (i.e. mostly lust) to the mortified inhabitants of the village.<br />Confronted to this wonder-working technology, the Church- a mere puppet of the state- is simply powerless, as evinced in the gluttonous explosion of the repressed mayor and the parish priest's futile attempts to reform an alcoholic, moronic wife-beater with the rote-learning of catechism and the empty ritual of confession.<br />Of course the devil wins, the pleasures of the flesh (including extra-marital sex) are recognized as innocent, and the evil Catholic mayor redeems himself by joining the crusade of modern political correctness : the fight against «exclusion.» <br />I will not deny *Chocolat* has a certain charm, but I think this is precisely part of its evil. I found it an insidious, snide attack on religion, via caricature and the use of strawmen, suggesting ultimately that the very effort to control one's impulses is the very source of debauchery and violence, and that he who lets himself be gently led into temptation will find his own balance and moderation- a popularized Freudianism that is belied by the modern pandemic of obesity and increasingly depraved pornography, to mention only two examples.<br />As for the movie's depiction of life in a French village, as a Frenchman who has spent most of his holidays in one of them, I can say that it is almost as laughable as any attempt by Americans to capture things French. The nickname of the old-age pension itself, «le Mortoir » is not even good French : we would say «le Mouroir », and this is precisely how the French subtitles «translated» the term.<br />I gave the movie two stars however, as I would reserve the lowest rating (one star) to films I could not finish (like for instance *Jefferson in Paris* or *The Gospel According to St Matthew*) and I think any film that has Carrie-Ann Moss in it deserves at least two stars (even that Mars movie, for no other reason.)
B00000K2SC|5.0|One of my favorite all time movies and certainly a title that can be watched over and over.<br />First off this movie is simply one of the greatest sci fi movies ever made, much better than the Star Wars or Star Trek films simply because the writing of this script was so well done.  The incredible cinematography and special effects that went into making this film would make it worth watching alone even if the plot, story and characters weren't all that great, but thankfully they are that and more.<br />The story is a Christology in part and an allegory that leans so towards the Christian experience  that either the writers are believers or perhaps they just feel Christ and the beliefs that surround Him are such good myths that they'd high jack the premise and make a modern science fiction story about it.  The quickie dictionary definition of an allegory is this: &quot;the expression through symbolism of truths about human experience&quot; and this movie does a good job of using symbolism to show us where we really are (at least from the Christian stand point).<br />This world is not real in the sense that our surroundings are mostly just &quot;sensory perception&quot; our real persona has its existence in another dimension. And to believers this world isn't our true home, we are &quot;Strangers in a Strange Land&quot; (and like in  R.A.H's famous book of the same name, Michael is able to manipulate &quot;physical&quot; reality as is Neo in The Matrix simply because they see it for what it really is.)  &quot;What is Real?&quot; asks Morpheus (named after the Greek god of dreams) of Neo  (new) the one he believes might be the &quot;one&quot;, the messiah figure predicted by the Oracle.<br />Take the blue pill and continue your life as it is (reject true reality in favor of comfort) or take the red pill (symbolic of the blood perhaps?) and you can never go back.  Painful, yet necessary rebirth occurs, one's real self is allowed to be alive.  &quot;My eyes hurt&quot; - &quot;Because you've never used them before&quot;<br />Evil personified is bent on keeping humans blind so that they can be consumed.  In this movie the reason is technical and has to do with physical energy, but the premise is not new, in 'The Screwtape Letters' (C.S. Lewis) the consumption is of  spiritual energy, but the allegory remains constant and I think that the idea (whether one is religious or not) hits close to home in us all.<br />Of course the often shown highlight scene of Neo dodging bullets, the karate fight scene and many other great technical stunts make this movie a great joy to watch, but watch it several times, because many of the messages are caught the second, third or in later viewings.<br />When all seems lost Trinity proclaims that she is no longer afraid.<br />Too much from a techo/sci fi movie?  Perhaps... But maybe we could all use a reminder to live our lives with such trust.- &quot;Because you've never used them before&quot;<br />Evil personified is bent on keeping humans blind so that they can be consumed.

B00005RFQ5|4.0|Prince crossed that line between mad genious and utter fruitcake over a decade ago. If \\"The Rainbow Children\\" proves anything, it's that he's not ready to rejoin us on planet Earth anytime soon. <br />The album is heavily influenced by Prince's recent conversion to a Jehovah's Witness. Now if you don't want someone's religious or spiritual views thrown in your face then perhaps this album isn't for you. The lyrics are an epic story with some rather controversial views on religion, racism, and even the subjugation of women. It feels like you're learning about the Old Testament all over again. Or that he's trying to proselytize some poor soul into his cult followings.  It's a rather interesting story nonetheless.<br />Some of my favorites include the James Brown-inspired \\"The Work Pt. 1\\", the jazzy Book of Genesis-epic \\"The Rainbow Children\\", and \\"Family Name\\". The real clunkers in this album are his drippy love ballads like the D'Angelo-inspired \\"Muse 2 the Pharaoh\\" and \\"She Loves Me 4 Me\\". Remember when his love songs had more \\"umph\\" in them (sighs)?<br />Musically the album ranges in jazz to neo-soul to gospel to hard rock to even some electronica (actually he's just cranking up the synthesizers at maximum); very remiscent of his experiments in \\"Sign O' the Times\\". It's slower than his previous albums, but he manages to occassionally throw in his signature guitar solos. It takes some listens to appreciate it, but overall Prince hasn't put out a concept album this good in years.
0385505833|3.0|I have read every one of John Grisham's works.  His law-themed selections are stunning, they really probe me to think and expand my horizons.I reflect on them for days after I have turned the last page!  SKIPPING CHRISTMAS was not a selection that would make me want to read each of his other works.<br />The story was interesting but I feel the promotional made the book out to be better than it really was. The parental sacrifice was completely unselfish and truly in the spirit of Christmas.  Perhaps because I could have never imagined this sacrifice being made for me, I cannot relate to the book. Maybe it will cause us to dwell more on the true meaning of Christmas, accepting a wonderfully unselfish gift that was given freely to all mankind, on the first Christmas ever.
B000005S0D|3.0|... but definitely NOT intended to Camel fans. <BR>This is one more mid-80s commercial approach that followed The Single Factor which -confessed by the bands producer- was an attempt to keep the good relationship with the record company by that moment. Fortunately later releases like Dust And Dreams brought Camel spirit back.<BR>Stationary Traveller is an FM oriented work. A pop-shifted album made by one of the best proggressive bands. And youll notice this: they musicality is still recognizeable among simple and easy tunes.<BR>Classic Camel fans, avoid it. Pop FM radio lovers: perhaps youll find a couple of good songs on it.
B00003CXRP|4.0|An interesting attempt by Zemeckis. Hanks does a solid job of conveying the dementia brought on by four years of isolation. Zemeckis' decision to film the island segment in silence was well advised, and successfully evokes a feeling of isolation. One complaint I have about the editing was the heavy handed use of slow-mo - it made some of the segments seem innappropritely comical. <br />On the other hand, I appreciated that Zemeckis chose not to dumb down the film. The ending (which at least one reviewer has complained of as trite) was intelligent and consistent with the theme of the movie (as the unopened package was most definitely a reference to the myth of Pandora, representing Hanks' hopes of returning to civilization - and his hope was what kept him alive).
B000002J1B|5.0|This immense musical work was the present perfect continuum to the immediate two previous albums. In my opinion the very best Yes era, not incidentally the very best also for several other great great prog bands, like Genesis, EL&amp;P, etc. <BR>With only three tracks, you can travel form the soft celestial peaceful moods to very intricate polytonal passages, almost like in Tchaikovskys Overture 1812 or Stravinskys Firebird.<BR>Your must-have prog library will not be complete without this album.
B000002A3T|5.0|(...) As a musician and guitarist for 13 years, believe me when I say that this is one of Floyd's best albums ever. If you're a guitarist, it's especially enjoyable, but anyone who appreciates great music can delve into these lush, haunting soundscapes. Standout cuts are Poles Apart, A Great Day For Freedom, Coming Back To Life, and High Hopes, although every track is good. After a few listens, these dreamy tunes will have you punching the repeat function on your CD player more than once. Superb recording!
B00005N84D|5.0|This one, along with many other progressive masterpieces, saw the light back in 1973. Curiously several bands like EL&amp;P, Yes, King Crimson, PFM and of course Genesis had the the most wonderful music inspiration that year.<BR>It could be stated as the perfect partner to Fox Trot. Their tunes preserve those pristine moods, as well as another highly elaborate prog passages. Peter Gabriel vocals at their peak,  accompanied by a coherent sounding guitar and keyboard ensemble and a solid bass/drum framework conform an almost perfect mix to achieve a mastrpiece like this.<BR>Dont miss Nursery Cryme and The Lamb... either. With these four albums, youll get the real Genesis sense.
6305090564|5.0|If you like some of the quirky, anti-hero action/adventure films of the 1980's (e.g. \\"Indiana Jones\\", \\"Big Trouble in Little China\\", \\"Remo Williams\\", \\"Romancing the Stone\\", etc.), you'll at the very least LIKE this movie. You may even, as I do, find that you LOVE it and can't do without it.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you hate B-Movies, sea monsters that \\"drink you\\", goofy sidekicks, exploding speed boats, ensemble casts, killer toilets, elevators which can be operated remotely by shotgun, vague references to \\"the Posideon Adventure\\", international mercenaries, flying surf boards, torpedoes, champagne, the inevitable slower-than-human-running-speed hollywood explosions, and a little high-quality gore; do not see this movie.<br /><br />Be warned, if you choose to not watch it, or refuse to watch it regularly, you will doubtlessly grow tired and sad early in life, gain ten pounds over Christmas, and the lack of \\"Deep Rising\\" will leave you more susceptible to disease and infection. You will lose some hair in the places you want it, and gain hair where you least expect it. You will forget the taste of fresh peaches and find yourself living in Milwaukee.
B000006XDX|2.0|Sadly this excellent band had to make some concessions to the powers-that-be of the record industry. Because of that this album and the following -and better- Stationary Traveller were released. <BR>Particularly this one was named The Single Factor ironically honouring the whim the record company had to achieve that single FM-hit song which could raise some money.<BR>Just forget this poor work. No band is perfect.
B000002UAO|5.0|Released in December, 1965, this album represents, to me, everything that is good about music. The first really great Beatles album, R.S. features, as always, Lennon/McCartney and Harrison tracks, but it also features Ringo's writing debut &quot;What Goes On&quot;.
B000002KJQ|3.0|I have the original verson of Jesus just left chicago, and he does place quite a bit of CCCHHHIIICCCAAAGGGOO, so, your are part right, the remaster does place a bit more, but the originla had quite a bit.
B000002UDB|5.0|While the Magical Mystery Tour movie left something to be desired (let's face it. It (...)) the CD is teriffic. As an album it is one of the Beatles' best. Not only that, but, unlike the White Album, each and every song is impressive even when played alone. Just a great psychedelic disc.
B000002ORU|4.0|I am not a profound fan of The WHo. All I had was a compilation, MY GENERATION. I knew WHO's NEXT and TOMMY were considered their masterpieces, but never bothered buying them, because here in Brazil they are so expensive (you can find them only as imports) So, I went for the box set (import, of course) and spend my hard-earned money on it, risking to love or hate the band forever. I hit the bull eye. The music is fabulous.
B000002UAU|4.0|It may not be the best Beatles CD, but I have a hard time picking out a better album that is not by the Beatles (as a band or solo). If you like classic music, you'll love Sgt. Petter.
B0000064TT|5.0|This album is astonishing. The Dregs had a more varied style of music than Steve Morse's Band does now. Tha was what made it so revigorating, fantastic, absolutely phenomenal. 1978's WHAT IF is their finest hour.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver, released in '66, is quite different than the Beatles previous effort Rubber Soul. It features two &quot;firsts&quot; that the Beatles would become famous for: (1) First LSD influenced music, and (2) first song George really bases around a sitar. This album also features two of the greatest songs of all-time, John Lennon's &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; and George Harrison's masterpiece &quot;Taxman&quot;
B000001ELL|4.0|We all know it was not Peter who recorded the drums here (except for DIRTY LIVIN). Anton Fig was the drummer. Anyway, this is a fine record. No way it's in the same league of LOVE GUN, but it's still a little bit solid and well crafted. No reason to reap scorn upon &quot;I WAS MADE FOR LOVIN'YOU&quot;. It's a pop song with foolish lyrics, but KISS always did that, the difference to other bands being that they did it with skill and mastery of their instruments and songwriting techniques. I like DYNASTY. It's definetely not near any of their firs six albuns, therefore was really the &quot;beginning of the end&quot;, but it's a good rock record.
B000002UB3|5.0|This album really demonstrates why The Beatles' 1 is not a definative collection. While this CD does have some classics (&quot;Come Together&quot;, &quot;Something&quot;) it is the lesser known songs that carry this album. The Golden Slumbers medly (&quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;, &quot;carry That Weight&quot;, &quot;The End&quot;) is one of the best songs of all time. Ya can't find that on &quot;1&quot;.
B000002KIE|4.0|NEver, before or afterwards the Sex Pistols, a band who released only one full-lenght album in their career received so much attention!!! But his single albuns is really strong.
B000002UAX|5.0|If you are only going to buy one Beatles album, this should be it. It is hard to say what the best songs are on this disc, because (excluding &quot;I Will&quot; &amp; &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;) they are nothing special alone, but, if you play them with the whole CD, it is like MAGIC!!!
B000000OMB|5.0|This first album by ASIA is astonishing. To speak the truth, I think it's their only worthwhile album. THe production (by Mike Stone) is clearly slick and commercial, but the songs are top-notch. Howe's guitar never sounded so fresh, alive and hard before. Carl Palmer is explendid, freed from EMERSON LAKE &amp; PALMER's tendency to overblown their songs. Wetton's voice is one of rock's best, and Downes' keyboards fit in completely. It's a shame it didn't last long and, for their second laubm, Asia tried even harder to go totally mainstream, sealing the destiny of the band, with the departure of Steve Howe (Howe still tried to get total mainstream attention with the horrrible GTR project).
6304259093|1.0|This has got to be one of the biggest peices of (...) to ever come out.  This \\"movie\\" is the equivalent of being punched (...) by an elephant for 5 straight days.  Strongest possible recomondation to avoid.  Trust me \\"if it only (...), I'd tell you to rent it\\".
067144901X|5.0|I STILL remember this favorite...I know it by heart from reading it first to my nephew, then to my son, now aged 9 and 8.  I can recall them both as toddlers saying &quot;la, la, la&quot; when we'd get to those 3 singing sheep!  This is a MUST have for every child aged 1 to 2.
0345413377|5.0|This is truely a great book! I read the previous two books in the trilogy about a year before reading this one. In the third book of \\"his dark materials\\" he thankfully keeps the story going on the same track that he started it in, the only problem i could see with the book is the ending. I cant get over how he ended the book (...). It was very sad how he ended the book, and I truely hope he does something about it. As for people saying that it is satanic? lol, that is very funny, it is very far from being satanic, and to any christian that says it is demonic in anyway, isnt it true that god wants us to think in new ways and explore ourselves? if not, then we would all be catholic!!!(no offense intended)
6305622930|5.0|This movie gives an accuate account of both war and GEN Patton's lfe.  I would highly recommend to anyone.  Goerge C. Scott at his best.  Very realistic!
0767903862|4.0|Bill Bryson is the incredulous tourist, no matter where he goes. In this book, he sets his sights on Australia, that vast undiscovered and mostly-ignored continent-country in the Southern Hemisphere. <br />His descriptions of Australia, its people, flora, fauna, and landscape are by turns amusing and insightful. With wide-eyed wonder, he tells us the story of the Prime Minister who just disappeared into the surf, the American couple left behind on a diving expedition, and several stories of people just discovering something by walking through the bush. Imagine walking back into town with a 60-pound nugget of gold, that had just been sitting in the desert!<br />In some places, his writing is uneven. Sometimes we are walked though pages about something he finds interesting, but which made me yawn; other times he skips over what I think is fascinating. His humour makes up for the oversights, but these oversights keep me from giving the book a fifth star.<br />If you've ever lived in Australia, it's useful to see the country from an outsider's point of view. If you haven't been there, but would love to go, pick up this book for an entertaining introduction to the country. It's not a heavy-hitter, certainly not something you'd read if you want an introduction to Australia's vast history, but amusing and informative nonetheless.
B00000ILDF|5.0|Why does everybody think this is so terrible. I think its the best one made. Fincher directed it really well. Sigourney weaver acting was superb and the dark effect made it something different. The close shave between Ripley and the alien was the best bit. And the shaved head, great!

B00005NW02|4.0|SoaD has put out a very good disc with TOXICITY. It was probably one of the most anticipated metal releases this year and it doesnt disappoint. The album has some great melodies to go aling with some straight ahead in your face rock. (Chop Suey) It also has some pretty amusing lyrics (Needles). DEER DANCE is also a great song on this disc. Some of the lyrics are serious and try to make the listener think.  JET PILOT, BOUNCE, ATWA, FOREST, and AERIALS are also some of the stand outs here that you will want to listen to. Get this CD now
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a great movie. The animation is breathtaking and the plot is great! Two hours sound long, but I can assure you, it will only feel like 20 minutes. <BR>Simply great. Buy it now if you like good movies.
B00005OWEG|5.0|When I found out the APOCALYPSE NOW was being re-released with additional footage, I looked forward till it came out. I can say that APOCALYPSE NOW is one of the greatest movies ever made, and with the additional footage that we now have, the movie is even better. The additional sceens with Robert Duvall makes his looney character even loonier and thats a good thing. The only extra scene i didnt care to much for was the dinner scene. To me it slowed down the movie and wasnt all that necessary. The additional scenes on the boat were also good we got a better look into the charecters, something we missed in the original. I can say that this is an excellent DVD in my opinion and if you liked the original, you will love this one.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|It's been a while since I watched this movie at the cinemas, and I absolutely loved it then.  Coming back to it, this isn't so good.  Sure it's brilliant, but there are far better animated films out there, most of them including the words 'Toy' and 'Story'.  Of course, by choosing to use computer animation, Dreamworks' fantastic film will always fall short of the 'Toy Story' movies that it can't hope to compete with.<br />However, let me go onto why this film is good!  First of all, the voices are well chosen, with Eddie Murphy being completely hilarious in all of his scenes.  There's also Mike Myers with a Scottish accent and the excellent Camerion Diaz, who just defies to be pigeon-holed.  On top of that there is superb animation, with the viewer being able to see every individual hair on the animals etc.  Of course, that's all very out-dated now that 'Final Fantasy' has been released.  The most important thing about this film though is the fact that it's very funny.  There's toilet humour for the kids and jokes for the adults, who will lap up the Gingerbread Man who screams 'Eat me' at his torturers.  It's even quite touching at the end, yet however much you might admire the ending, you can't help but wish that Cameron Diaz's character had remained pretty.  For instance, why did she have to morph for her and Shrek to be in love?  Probably because it would have been too disturbing for a children's film, but still...<br />Now onto the bad points.  The funny send-up of the Disney films is actually quite bitter, with the guy that made 'Shrek' having parted company from the Disney studios.  After all, there's nothing wrong with good old-fashioned fairytale.  This is a decidedly modern piece, and this is perhaps why it doesn't quite have the magic of films such as 'Beauty and the Beast' and it's nowhere near as sophisticated as the 'Toy Story' films.<br />However, definitely one to watch, for adults and children.  And in appealing to both age groups it has certainly achieved something.
B00005JKHP|5.0|the directors cut is great for all the fans of star trek <BR> it goes into tht tech make up of the movie includeing a formore undisclosed info on gene rondenberry, the directors cut is a must see when the edited parts of the movie are put back it really makes for entertainment well beyond the frist movie , it's been worth the wait,buy it, rent, what ever,just do it go now and kick back and go where no dvd has gone before in star trek land!
B00003CXSP|3.0|When this film was released, every went expecting to be disappointed.  Every was upset that there was no Jodie Foster, who was so excellent in 'Silence Of The Lambs'.  Everyone had thought that Hannibal's role itself had become a little too camp.  Everyone was worried about the ending...<br />Well, I went with everyone of those thoughts in my head and was very surprised.  For one, I'm a fan of Julianne Moore and I'm not going to hear anything bad about her.  The role she plays is very different to the one that Foster played in that for 'Hannibal' the anti-hero and heroine are kept apart throughout the majority of the movie.  Although this makes for a lack of sexual chemistry until the very end, this fault is mostly that of the book and not that of the directors or actors.  Still, I do confess to preferring Jodie Foster.  Or perhaps I just liked the film better.<br />As for Hannibal himself.  He's fairly likeable, which means that he's not remotely scary.  Just funny.  He is not remotely creepy here and his role has been severely watered down.  Any part of the movie where you find yourself hiding behind your hands will be on account of gratuitous gore that punctuates the entire movie.<br />As for the ending, let's just say it's changed.  It's not exactly satisfactory, but it's a great deal better than the cop-out at the end of the book.  At the end of the day though, everyone was bound to like 'The Silence Of The Lambs' better.  Ridley Scott did well to salvage anything from this.  He's a talented director and he's employed talented actors.  However, entertaining and quite absorbing at times as this is, it's not a patch on the prequel.  It fades quickly from the memory but it's good whilst it lasts.
0380977281|4.0|This book is entertaining and well worth the time if you like fairy tales.<br />The main plot revolves around a young man who makes a rash promise to his first crush, and sets out on a quest to fulfill it.  The book is more about the adventures and journey through the magical land.  This is where the book really shines as it makes the setting come alive with lots of little details.  The characters are not developed in-depth, mostly stock fairy tale folk (hero, bad prince, evil witch) but you get a good feel for them.  It would be a great book to read to a kid at night. It's like cotton candy: light, enjoyable, but not a whole lot of substance.<br />For those who are familiar with Gaiman's work this is not as dark or detailed as most of his stuff.
B00005R87Q|2.0|From the first time I seen this movie I noticed something, it was a movie that was about a bunch of really nice cars and not much of a story plot.  I thought the movie was good but I am the time that looks for a good story plot.  If you are one of those people that like a good plot this is not the movie for you.  If you just like the cover of the book and not what is in it, then this movie is for you.  I would recommend renting it before even thinking about buying this movie.
0743420373|5.0|During the first 150 pages of this book, I kept saying, &quot;How did they sell so many of these books?  This book has too many grammatical errors, and too many statistics!&quot;<br />I was reminded of a passage in Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren's book, &quot;How to Read a Book&quot; -- &quot;Good books are over your head; they would not be good for you if they were not.&quot;<br />Then, I noticed, as I really pondered the messages of this book on frugality, that I had been writing 101 goals, in a notebook, while reading this book.  This book has been and is good for me.<br />Also, because I was raised with status symbols, with no education on how to be wealthy, I learned, while reading this book, that when I slow down, and really do what I love to do, when I really focus upon thinking like someone whose net worth is at least $1 million, I am free to appreciate all that I have, and all that will come to me, in due time.<br />I am grateful to these authors, because I no longer look at other people's status symbols, and decide to feel pain --- I have created a vision for myself, based upon what is right for me, as opposed to external measurements of what I should have to prove who I am.<br />Reading this book has definitely lifted a burden from my shoulders.<br />Thank you.<br />I will definitely read other books written by these authors, because I want a net worth that comfortably places me in the millionaire club, while I make a difference.
B00005QK3W|4.0|This is good, solid McCartney. Better than the average McCartney album. Paul said he played these songs to Ringo before recording them, and Ringo said, &quot;You're not going to put a bunch of stuff on top of them, are you?&quot; So Paul took Ringo's advice, and made rather stripped down recordings, with not a lot of effects and orchestras added. Leave it to a fellow Beatle to help another Beatle, still, after all these years. Because Ringo's advice is one of the strengths of this album: solid music, that is not overslick (God, check out Mick Jagger's new album if you want to hear overslick!). A few clunkers punctuate the album. But, overall, I was pleased to hear some of the best recordings AND compositions Paul has done in his solo career on DRIVING RAIN.
B00004Z459|2.0|People! This cd is [lousy]. I can't believe the phony hype surrounding it. The songs are written terribly, how many must a band use lyrics that have been said a 1,000 times over. \\"Gotta run away\\", \\"I need a place for my head\\", these have been done by Cold, then Staind(Cold was before Staind) then Taproot, and every othernu-metal act, and they've been done better. The song just sound like they were written to be hits, and are too catchy. The rapper...well, he's just not very good, and it sound like the only reason hes there is to make their music more accesable to more people. Then theres the music.<BR>I swear unless youve seen a video, or seen them live you would think there is no bassist in the band. Their music is almost always 4/4 midtempo flatness. The vocals and guitar is all you hear, nothing seems to overtake my ears, no matter how loud I put the volume up. The band (except for the DJ) has relatively no skill at what they're doing and Chesters voice is all studio. <BR>Yeah, put these guys up to any of the other nu-metal and its no contest, you like rap-rock listen to Nonpoint, you like 2 lead singers (one sings and one raps) listen to Darwin's Waiting Room. If you want emotionless music that has been done millions of times before....listen to Linkin Park.
B00003CXTF|1.0|This is the worst movie I saw in a theater. No one with an iota of good sense should see it. It cheapens the historical event it intends to honor. Even the explosions, the one thing Michael Bay can do well, aren't worth watching.<br />Spend your money on From Here to Eternity instead.
0440219078|5.0|In the wonderfully imaginative mind of Lois Lowry, a futuristic Community has been created where there is no more war, no more suffering, no more starvation, no more unemployment, no more choices.  Everyone is seemingly happy.  This is where a Twelve named Jonas lives.  He is selected one day to be the Receiver of Memory of his society by the Elders of the Community.  This is the highest honor to receive and at first Jonas is nervous, but excited to start training.  But once under the instruction of his mentor, The Giver, who teaches him the truth about the choices his ancestors made, Jonas begins to understand the pain involved in bearing the burden of truth.  Together with the Giver, he makes the tough decision to initiate change, if he can survive long enough to do so.<BR>This book was one of the most engaging books I have ever read. Lowry has a talent for creating memorable characters and uses stark details that place the reader right alongside Jonas.  She also has a knack for lucid pacing and dialogue.  This book examines the question of the choices we might make to &quot;make this world a better place,&quot; and the sacrifice that comes with comfort. I recommend this novel to readers of all ages.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THE MOVIE THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT, BUT AFTER WATCHING IT THE SECOND TIME, THE MOVIE MADE BETTER SENSE.  I'M A HUGE FAN OF ANGELINA JOLIE AND HER PERFORMANCE WAS GREAT, BUT I LIKED HER BETTER IN THE ORIGINAL SIN.  TOMB RAIDER DIDN'T REALLY HAVE MUCH ACTION, EXCEPT FOR THE ONE SCENE WHERE HER HOUSE WAS BROKEN INTO WHEN SHE WAS DOING THE BUNGI BALLET.  THAT WAS THE BEST SCENE OF THE ENTIRE FILM AND IT WAS GREAT.  TOMB RAIDER WASN'T A TERRIBLE MOVIE AND I'D RECOMMEND FOR IT TO BE SEEN ATLEAST ONCE.
B00000IQUT|4.0|Anytime I see a movie that has been \\"banned\\" and dubbed \\"the most controversial movie of all time,\\" I'm generally not pleased. Apparently that kind of \\"reputation\\" sets up too many expectations for me. This was not entirely the case when seeing I Spit On Your Grave, however. I did have those kind of expectations set up, but the film did what it was supposed to -- evoke emotions.<br />I Spit On Your Grave (aka Day of the Woman) is the tragic story of Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton). A young attractive writer from New York, Jennifer moves to a small town out in the middle of nowhere to work on her first novel. We quickly learn that this small town is something out of Deliverance country with Deliverance-type residents -- in particular, four men, all of whom work at the general store/gas station. Three of them are as mean as Hell and the other, Matthew (Richard Pace), is \\"slow,\\" going along with whatever his friends do.<br />Jennifer pulls in to fill up for the first time, the boys see her, and decide to go to her house across the lake and rape her. It may seem as if I'm moving too fast or skipping details, but really I'm not -- that just about sums it up. We soon learn that the initial reason behind committing these rapes is to \\"make Matthew a man.\\" That reason quickly becomes secondary, as the men turn into utter monsters, losing any sense of \\"right\\" they may have ever had. The rape scenes are quite graphic -- they leave the viewer with an acute sense of emptiness and despair -- Jennifer crawls nude trying to escape, having no idea how to. The men catch up with her and continue to rape her. This goes on for 30 minutes, if not longer.<br />Physically and emotionally shaken, Jennifer begins to plot revenge and viewers begin to root for her as we see her deserving revenge. Once Jennifer comes into contact with each of the four men, she brutally kills them, each in a different and very \\"creative\\" way.<br />One problem I had with this film overall deals with believability-- would the rapists have killed Jennifer having so many reasons and opportunities to do so? For example, in one scene, Jennifer has the ringleader at gunpoint, but hands her gun over to him (I assume this was all part of her plan). Would the rapist, who just begged the woman he raped for his life, have thrown the gun away as he did? It may just be that I'm forgetting that the rapists in this film are stupid and logic doesn't apply to them.<br />One aspect of the film that makes it especially eerie and unusual is the total lack of any musical score. Perhaps the only music throughout the film is Jennifer's classical music, which she listens to while killing one of the men. This lack of score oddly makes the viewer feel like an invisible observer -- there's nothing to distract us away from the woods, from the rapes, and from the eventual gore.<br />Camille Keaton is excellent as Jennifer Hill. She very accurately portrays Jennifer's transformations from sane writer to pitiful victim, from vengeful killer to satisfied woman. If you can look at the graphic nature of the rape scenes as purposeful, in that we as viewers can better understand why Jennifer does what she does, see this movie. Otherwise, you might just regret it. Rating: 3 / 4(...)
B00005MG2Y|5.0|This CD is the best CD I've ever bought.  All the songs are great esp. 'Papercut', 'A Place For My Head', and 'Cure For The Itch'.  All the songs have great lyrics, and are written by Linkin Park.  You won't be dissapointed if you buy this CD.
B00005NQGO|1.0|I am a Cirque du Soleil fan and waited eagerly for the release of the Journey of Man.  With the hype and previews, I expected this one to outshine the recent others.  Much to my dismay, not only was it about half as long, but had only two acts I considered equal to their reputation.  <br />Much of the time was taken up with scenes and music that are common to many a movie/performance.  I normally love the story lines that accompany the performances, but this one spent way too much of the already short time on &quot;nothing&quot;.  <br />The two performances that were worth veiwing were still not enough to make me want to keep the video.  I sent it back.
B00003CXXI|1.0|To start, he animation is good, and there are a few good visual jokes.<br />But the plot is so thin, so contrived that it would not have filled out an episode of Power Rangers.  <br />Shrek is an ogre who only wants to be left alone.  Lord Farquaad rounds up all the Fairy Tale Creatures in the land, and relocates them to Shrek's swamp, less than a mile away.  Why?  Apparently for absolutely no reason other than there is no movie if he doesn't.  Farquaad says he will relocate them again (to where?) if Shrek will retreve the Princess he needs to marry to become a King.  Only complication is that the Princess is under a curse (which seems to take the night off while Shrek and Donkey are talking by the light of the moon). <br />(Adult) inunendo and toilet humor make this unsuitable for small children.  Lack of characterization, plot or internal consistancy make it unsuitable for anyone else.
0671024256|4.0|I am not a writer, nor do I pretend to be one. However, aspirations to become a writer is an ambition we all have, at least those that appreciate good books. This Book, On Writing is a great resource from someone who has been quite successful at the craft. His thoughts on the subject are very candid, and amusing. I apreciate the time he has taken to put together such an exellent guide for those would be writers, and those who aspire to become writers, the nuts and bolts of writing. He fully illustrates what the writing life is like, and shows that it takes complete dedication to the art in order to accomplish such a task. Who am I to recomend such a book? a very delighted reader. A great read for a student of the written word.
B00003CXTF|1.0|Beautifully filmed, stupidly written.  Was there really a demand for a movie about Pearl Harbor involving people kissing amongst a cloud of parachute silk?  Very disappointing.

B00003CXXS|5.0|The 3rd installment of the JP franchise is without a doubt that darkest, fastest-moving, heart-pounding, and exciting movie in the film series.  Sure the 1st JP is a pure classic and The Lost World tries to recapture the awe of the orginal and The Lost World *tries* to do the same thing but doesn't pull it off very well.  Jurassic Park 3 tells you right from the start with a claw ripping through the JP logo that this time the dinosaurs aren't playing around.  Sam Neil returns and gives a excellent performance as usual. The supporting cast does well also with William H. Macy and Tea Lenio giving strong performances.  The real winners here though are the dinosaurs. As soon as humans once again arrive and disrupt their natural habitat they are just fed up it seems and don't play any games.  In the first two films the dinosaurs seem a bit hesitant to eat some good ol' human flesh but, not in this film though. The new bad boy Spinosaurus quickly claims himself as the king of the jungle by taking out one of the legendary actors of the series. (You will seat what I mean) The raptors return badder and smarter. The most immpresive new Dino by far in the flying Pterandons. The special effects are as usual .. amazing. This a perfect addition to any Jurassic Park fan's  DVD library.

B0000296SI|4.0|After buying the &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot; unedited version by accident, and having to shut it off because the foul language was just rediculous, I was certainly glad to have purchased the &quot;clean version of this one.&quot;Adam's Song&quot; was the cut on the radio that sold me on this purchase, it is a serious and beautiful song that touches the heart.  The rest is light, fun and refreshing catchy alternative, which is MY kind of music.  My other favorite on this CD is &quot;The Party Song.&quot;  I can imagine becoming blue faced singing this one, must've been challenging.  There's plenty to enjoy here, so go for it!  If you like Blink, don't bat an eye, buy it.
068480025X|4.0|The assignment to go assasinate Hitler in his own underground bunker is not your typical orders except for a super commando who is pitted against a German commando whose assignment is to stop our man who has been sent by Franklin Roosevelt.  The description of the anguish and futlility of the German civilians in Berlin during the constant bombing is very vivid and conveyed to this reader some of the misery that was being experienced.  This requires good wordsmithing.  The plot held my attention and I thought that for a cold blooded murderer, Captain Jack Cray displayed a unique sense of humor that should have been contrary to the imagine that was trying to be portrayed.  I found this very refreshing in lieu of the seriousness of his predicament.  This was a good read.
6304025831|5.0|Although not quite as thrilling as his previous pieces, Martin Scorsese still scores with a \\"Goodfellas\\" goes to Vegas film.<br /><br />I put it this way simply because, part of the appeal is visiting with so much of the same cast as 1990's \\"Goodfellas\\". Robert DeNiro is our leading man this time, as Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein a character based on the real Frank Rosenthal who'd been there, done that.  Joe Pesci plays an eerily similar character to his \\"Tommy DeVito\\" sociopath from \\"Goodfellas\\", as Sams associate with whom NO sane person should associate.<br /><br />Other fun \\"mobster\\" character actors like Frank Vincent are on tap too.  I personally think Frank is terrific, and has a wonderful presence and look with all that thick silver hair.  He reminds me a bit of Dennis Farina, another great actor who is far more famous.  Frank was classic as \\"Billy Batts\\" in \\"Goodfellas\\" and I enjoyed him here as well.  I wish we'd see him more often.<br /><br />The true original, James Woods, effectively plays the smarmy ex-lover to Sharon Stone's \\"Ginger\\", a Vegas hustler, who marries Sam (DeNiro) for his money and connections.  Love has nothing to do with this marriage as we soon see, when Ginger continues to love  Woods, and much worse.  Stone is believable, albeit melodramatic to the max, as she  entertainingly deteriorates in her marriage to DeNiro.  She deserved her award for this performance.<br /><br />Despite all the good factored into this film, something is intangibly missing here when you compare to \\"Goodfellas.\\" That's why a \\"Casino\\", great as it is, is so similarly done and themed, it  seems to pale in comparison. I think if we didn't have \\"Goodfellas\\" to compare \\"Casino\\" to this one, it would stand out on its own as an original masterpiece.  However, since it's the same director, similar and terrific soundtrack used in the same fashion, nearly identical cast, and mobster theme...you can't HELP but compare!  You kind of feel like Scorsese said, well, it worked once, so let's change a few elements, give the movie a new name, and have \\"Goodfellas Revisited.\\"<br /><br />If \\"Casino\\" had been first, would we think \\"Goodfellas\\"  paled by comparison?  No, we would say Scorsese topped \\"Casino\\".  No matter how you slice it, side by side, comparisons would have been made regardless of chronology.  Therefore, once an extraordinary film is made, it seems silly to attempt to recapture THAT magic, NEW magic is always preferable.<br /><br />Despite all that, this film is highly entertaining and definitely worth makng a place for in your movie library.nts, give the movie a new name, and have \\"Goodfellas Revisited.\\"      If \\"Casino\\" had been first, would we think \\"Goodfellas\\"  paled by comparison?

B00003CXZ4|5.0|If you haven't seen this (stunning, brilliant, wonderful) movie yet, don't read anything else about it. Just go see it. With as little prior knowledge as possible. Really. Trust me on this.<BR>That said, I know I'm basically just adding, with little consequence, to the near-universal (and quite well-documented) breathless praise that's already been showered on Memento. But so what? It's that good. I'll make it simple: This is one of the most fascinating films to come around in recent times (perhaps ever?). One of the few that I could describe as &quot;mind-blowing&quot; with a straight face. One that can be watched over and over--in fact it practically demands it--without getting dull. The script is snappy and the cast is top-notch. The backwards storytelling may be just a gimmick, but it's quite a clever one, especially in the context of this story. Not only does it raise the classic suspense/noir tactics to another level, but it puts the viewer in Leonard's head, forcing us at first to see things as fractured and stilted as he does. It's quite an experience. <BR>Just see it. Really. This is the kind of movie that makes you feel like part of a secret club after watching it. The kind you get into heated discussions with strangers over. The kind you implore all your friends to see. The kind that'll haunt you--and you won't mind.

0812567110|4.0|Oscar Wilde's strange and intriguing mind is apparent in this book, which is full of interesting concepts and bizarre happenings.  Dorian Gray, a young man who is obsessed with his own good looks, befriends an English Lord and a struggling painter.  After Basil, the painter, finishes Dorian's portrait, they are stunned by its magnificence and how lifelike it appears.  Seeing this, Dorian is angered when he realizes that the portrait will live forever and retain its beauty while he himself is left to age.  Dorian decides to trade his soul for everlasting youth, and to always retain his beauty, just like the portrait.<br />Since Dorian believes himself to be immortal, he dabbles into various sinful acts.  He carelessly pursues a relationship with Sibyl Vane, an actress, constantly letting her down and breaking her heart.  Dorian is involved in several mysterious deaths, and he even explores the London underground opium scene.  Even though Dorian does all of these things, somehow he remains young, to the surprise of his peers.  In the end, however, Dorian receives the punishment he deserves through a series of bizarre events.  The &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theme is strongly emphasized in the conclusion of the novel, which serves as a fitting end for Dorian's struggle with sin.<br />This classic literary work is frequently exciting, but can sometimes delve into the monotony of 19th century British affairs (which may be a little tedious.)  All in all, the novel is a wonderful concept which is given life by the genius of Oscar Wilde.  It is a perfect research topic as well because it contains many themes which can be applied to anything from English rhetoric to the Original Sin.  I myself wrote a term paper on the book and it was very easy to express my ideas because Wilde is so straight forward in his literary agendas.  So, whether you pick it for required reading or just for pleasure, The Picture of Dorian Gray is definitely a good choice.
0452282152|5.0|Captivating writing and tale of young servent Griet who become enamored and engaged in her duties to assist the great painter Vermeer.  This book intertwines some historical art history perspective with a slant of suduction of artistry.  Griet, only having become a servant, when her father, an artist himself of sorts in tile painting, becomes disabled.  She then must grow up almost immediately once she enters the Vermeer household.   She is not a well liked servent but catches the eye of the master, Vermeer himself.  An undercurrent of sexual tension in the book is often present and adds a strange twist to the ending.  If you appreciate good writing, good art and a good story, I can guarantee that you will absolutely enjoy this tale.

0066620996|5.0|In this book, Collins mentions about how, before Einstein, two other eminent scientists wrote down a formally equivalent theory to Einstein's theory of Special Relativity, but it was not until Einstein's piercing insight simplified the theory to some basic postulates, did scientists appreciate the truth. For people who were trying to build a solid business and get it on the path to greatness, the spectacular growth (atleast in market value) of companies during the Internet boom years did not ring true, but who would listen, least of all the hundreds of VCs fueling this exuberance. In contrast, the insights gained by Collins and his team, from over 15,000 hours of well-directed research done over five years, will ring true to anybody who is going through the process of building a great company through deliberate steps without being swayed by the most current management fad or the hottest unrelated market opportunity. <br />The \\"Hedgehog Concept\\" and the \\"Flywheel\\" findings explained in the book reiterate that, achieving true greatness is not simply a matter of capitalizing on being in the right place at the right time, but it is achieved through well thought out, focused, and sustained work. And in a highly competitive world, companies that want to stand out from the crowd need to get the best people on board first. <br />While these findings seem like self-evident truths, during times of trouble, companies almost always feel like they do not have time for such \\"idealistic\\" approaches. What this book does, is provide the right ideas to enable good companies to move towards greatness before getting into crisis. Collins great presentation of these findings, borne out of research on the present day good-to-great companies, brings a kind of clarity and understanding that will act like fresh fuel for companies on their way to greatness.
B000003S09|5.0|I'm glad I found this album. This is the beginning of progressive rock, or art rock if you want to call it. This sure is a work of art. Each song sounds diffrent, so you don't know what genre King Crimson is in. It's a shame that most of the members had to leave. Oh well, I found the originator. Each song deserves 5 stars. 21st Century Schiozid man is a weird jazz-rock song which is very loud and metalheads might like it. I Talk To The Wind is a very calm flute-ballad with excellent lyrics. Hard to believe that this song's on the album, judging from the 1st song. Epitaph is a great epic song, with some beatiful string arrangements. Once again, beatiful lyrics. Moonchild is excellent, all the way through. Yeah, I know it gets people mad that for 9 minutes they did almost nothing, but I don't mind. To me, it's a little break from the intense music you heard. Then, the best track on the album, In The Court Of The Crimson King. Very medieval sonding with another string arrangement, and exceelnt imagery with the lyrics. Does the song really end?<br />Beatiful album, goes up there with all the essentials.
6305922756|5.0|I can't believe that I hadn't seen this movie sooner.  I was very surprised by this very clever and hilarious &quot;mockumentary.&quot; (Yes, this isn't a real documentary.  Like &quot;The Blair Witch Project,&quot; a lot of people thought this movie was real.)  And now that it is restored and loaded with extras, the film is even better.<br />The movie is about a heavy metal band, Spinal Tap, who goes on tour and hopes to sell their new album, &quot;Smell the Glove&quot; to Tap fans everywhere.  Along that road to fame comes bumps and unexpected events.  The band starts to fight with each other while cities are starting to cancel their tours.  Though this movie is hilarious, it's funny in a very subtle way, so it makes you believe that you are watching an actual documentary.  As funny as it may seem, the movie does seem to have a ring of truth when it comes to the music business.<br />This DVD is loaded with extras!  The funniest part is when you go to the menu and you hear the band trying to figure out what the buttons mean.  (&quot;That one means `Play.'&quot;  &quot;But I didn't bring any of my instruments, I didn't know we had to play.&quot;)  It's pretty funny to hear the whole thing.  There are also lots of rare out-takes that are defiantly worth seeing.<br />The best feature of all is the audio commentary, which is done by Spinal Tap.  (Yes, they stay in character throughout the whole commentary.)  It's great listening to it the second time you see it.  You hear the band members accusing the director of the documentary trying to make them look bad, and using &quot;special&quot; cameras that they couldn't see.  They also try to figure out what the name of their skull head statue was.  It's pretty funny when they accuse the director of having a fake beard.  (&quot;Look, it's got glue all over on it.  Now, he's scratching it again.)  Definitely check out the audio commentary when you can.<br />&quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; is a cult classic, and is an awesome movie.  It's a very clever satire of documentaries on rock bands.  This is a classic film that you will not forget.ovie.  It's a very clever satire of documentaries on rock bands.  This is a classic film that you will not forget.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Compared to Dude Ranch, this definately sounds better (voice enhancement might have something to do with that). I liked the easy memorability and i thought 10 of 12 of these songs could have been hits. Good cd, i still listen to it though ive had it for a year and a half.
0783244320|4.0|An absolute side-splitter for Star Trek® fans, but stands on its own as well as a well-written, well-acted film with a good, exciting storyline and empathic characters. DVD watchers be sure to check out the Thermian soundtrack option - you can watch the ENTIRE MOVIE dubbed in Thermian with English subtitles!!!!!
B00005MP58|1.0|I decided to go to a local seller and after discussing the matter with a manager, bought a copy to try out, knowing I could return it if I was unhappy with the quality.  The colours are far to bright and washed out, characters are literally glowing white so that you cannot even make out their features and none of the lovely rich tapestry colours in the video came across on this DVD.  It is a pity, too, because A&E's Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful film and deserves to be presented with class, not failure.  The sound was wonderful, but because of the washed-out colour I returned it to the store and received a full refund.  (...)It is faulty (...).  Hopefully A&E will fix this error soon and put out a new edition, once more!!  In the meantime, do not hesitate to buy their DVD's of Victoria and Albert, Emma, Jane Eyre, Lorna Doone and Wives& Daughters.  I have those and they came out fine.
B00005R2M3|2.0|I bought Shakira's Unplugged album and subsequently all of her albums. Her sound blew me away. I learned Spanish so I could understand her lyrics, and when I had translated them I was amazed. What an artist. She was such a unique voice that spoke to your soul. She gave me shivers down my spine. This was a voice that spoke to everyone no matter whether you were fluent in Spanish or not. The fact that she made us want to learn the words she was singing was only a testament to her artistry. I was skeptical when I heard she was making an English album, and after hearing Laundry Service I was right for feeling so apprehensive. I do not enjoy Shakira in English. Why, why, do artists undersestimate the audience who even though they don't understand the language the artist sings in they forget that we do understand the universal language of music. And if we want to know what is being said we will learn. Sing in the language you feel comfortable in, artists please, we will follow, but when the translations are feeble like in this release we will not buy. And anyway the Blondie new wave guitars went out a decade ago and putting in a tango sound every other number or so does not fool anyone. Please Shakira canta Espanol. Be yourself.
B00005RFQ5|3.0|He is still searching, questioning, and exploring  religion nothing has changed. I don't want to here his rambings about God. It's old and tired. It's Jehovah Witness stuff other times his back to his same old nasty self. Prince is still lost. Well I'm tired of looking. I have been a fan for a long time maybe too long. This music is great, if it were an instrumental it would be even better. If you don't get put off by lyrics in music then this is great for you buy it .
B000002MFE|5.0|This album is perfect to listen to over and over again.  I like every song and so I used to keep it going at work.  For me it ranks in my top 3 albums, ever.
B000002L73|4.0|this is another one of my favorite ramones albums...it's also their most aggressive by a long shot.  it's got a neo-hardcore feel, although the songs aren't nearly fast enough.  dee dee gives us two of his best songs here with 'wart hog' and 'endless vacation.'  both are two of my favorite ramones songs as well.  'chasing the night' and 'howling at the moon' have a new wave feel (maybe it's the keyboards) but are great nonetheless.  the only songs i don't like on here are 'no go' and 'planet earth 1988.'  'i'm not afraid of life' is fairly mediocre too.  recommended nonetheless.
0060207051|5.0|I loved reading this book to my 2 year old. When she had it memorized I would pause and let her fill in the blanks.  I think that reading it out loud in a soft voice that gets even softer adds to the magic.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I never write reviews on web pages, but after seeing The Strokes <BR>play in Hartford last night,I simply can't get their music out of my head, and I need to share.  I have not been as struck by an album since Radiohead's &quot;Ok Computer&quot; took over my life three years ago.<br />Lovers of rock music, no, lovers of music need to check out this band's sound.  Buy it and listen to it two or three times over, let the melodies creep into your head and they will not go away.  There are bands out there that dont have songs as good as &quot;Hard to Explain&quot;, &quot;Is this it?&quot; and &quot;Modern Age&quot; in their whole catalogue.  The Strokes have these songs on their debut album.  <br />Player Haters step back. Everyone should make their own decision on this brilliant band.
B00003CXRM|3.0|First - the movie.  Three convicts escape from a chain-gang and set of on a quest, supposedly based on the Odyssey, although the Coens later claimed to have never read it.  However, we have Sirens who abduct one of the escapees, a Cyclops (played by John Goodman), and a Penny (Penelope).  In addition, we have less obvious characters, such as a manic-depressive bank robber, a KKK-belonging gubernatorial candidate, and his populist encumbant opponent.  All of these characters provide some big laughs, little chuckles, and a healthy dose of bluegrass music.  It's all presented in a washed-out colour that lends a beautiful visual style to the piece.<br />The film has most of the hallmarks of the Coen brothers.  This depression-era Mississippi didn't ever exist, but we wish it did.  It's filled with caricature characters with amusing quirks and one-track minds.  Missing is the occasional brutal violence that has a tendency to crop up in some of their work.  As such, this is one of the most good-hearted of the Coens' films, and I enjoyed it more than, say, Fargo.  However, it's probably more forgettable than their other work.  In addition, the film is almost a musical with its profusion of tunes.  However, I'm not much of a bluegrass fan, so found that the musical parts, though well-done, could have been shortened.  It moved just a little too slowly and lingered just a little too long in these passages.<br />Secondly - the DVD version.  Obviously, the sound and picture is very good, but the DVD left me disappointed.  Who could be more interesting in a commentary track than the Coen brothers?  Alas, there is no commentary - the best we get is a making of featurette that is only 20 minutes or so.  It's okay in itself, but too short to compensate.  Of equal length is a piece on the digitisation of the film to achieve the desired look (which could have been told in 1/2 the time) and a storyboard-to-film comparison, which was not particularly interesting.<br />The film might rate a 4, but this DVD edition is disappointing, and drops the rating to a 3.  I would certainly recommend it as a renter, but not worth the cost of buying the DVD.
0385505833|1.0|This book was very disappointing - very boring.  The story line was weak.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

The story seemed to drag on forever...and i found myself just reading it so that i could be done with it...(i can never put a book down once i start&gt;&gt;&gt;unfortunately...)<BR>If you know the arthurian legend all too well...like me...than u will be disappointed because you end up anticipating every move of the author...
B00003CXXI|5.0|This is one of the best movies i have ever watched and most definetly the best cartoon. It's not ur typical cartoon movie, and the jokes are just hallarious. It makes fun of all the other movies and just cracks u up!WATCH IT i promise u won't regret it!!!!!!
B00005QZWI|5.0|After becoming somewhat entralled of Tolkien's trilogy over the summer, I'm now greatly anticipating the film, which appears to be incredible. The score for this film turns out to be quite good. When I learned that it would be Howard Shore who would compose the music, a composer I am somewhat familiar with, I was a little apprehensive; he had never done something that promises to be so epic in proportion. I was pleasantly surprised, however. The music is never overbearing, though at times dark, and the choral additions are wonderful. &quot;Lothlorien&quot; is surprisingly melancholy, while the closing of &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-dum&quot; is particularly standout in its grief-stricken single voice. Interestingly flexible, the music often fluxuates in its mood, as in &quot;A Journey in the Dark&quot;, which starts off and ends pitch dark in tone and contains a moving mid-section, and &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;, an upbeat, catchy little tune that stands out in comparison with the album's more solemn selections. &quot;The Breaking of the Fellwoship&quot; remains my favorite song, and while it's pretty sad in color, it reamins hopeful, just like the end of the book and the upcoming film. Enya's contributions are suitable, fitting the mood of the score well. This is an admirable piece of work, and the film can't come soon enough.
078062999X|5.0|After watching the movie 3 times in one week (with my husband and two children) I checked the book out at the library. I have Hamlet fever. Excellent acting! Kenneth Branagh is phenomenal!!!!
B000002UA5|4.0|Ummagumma is definately in the &quot;love it or hate it&quot; category, simply because there is little of anything that goes down easy here. The first is a live disc that contains performances of their previously released material, my favorite goes to &quot;Careful With That Axe, Eugene&quot; because of the truly bizarry spacy atmosphere that had a big impact on many prog rock bands from the 1970s, that is those who wanted to be spacy. This version of &quot;Set the Controls&quot; is really fascinating, because it builds up and becomes extremely intense before the band decided to go in to outer space. Listening to these songs, they seem to have more of a 1970s feel to them, than a '60s feel, meaning that this has aged better than most of the early Syd Barrett-era material, in my book. But it's the second disc, the studio disc that is the epitome of &quot;love it or hate it&quot; basically each side is divided in to two halves, each half given to each band member, and most of it is extremely experimental, disturbing, and definately not recommended to those who expect everything from Pink Floyd to be just like &quot;Another Brick In the Wall Part 2&quot;, &quot;Hey You&quot;, &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;, etc. &quot;Sysyphus&quot;, Wright's piece, is divided in to four parts which demonstrates his keyboard abilities in a very avant-garde fashion. Here he plays piano, Hammond organ, and even Mellotron, as well as some strange noodling around I can't determine the origin of the sounds. Roger Waters' half includes the acoustic &quot;Grantchester Meadows&quot; and very easily recognizable as Pink Floyd. Next is &quot;Several Small Species of Small Furry Animals...&quot; which contains lots of different vocals sounds, some of them sounding like little creatures, and a person speaking what I guess is to be the old Pictish language. &quot;The Narrow Way&quot; is often overlooked as another one of those pioneering space rock songs. It starts off acoustic, but the second half features all sorts of electronic effects, which I'm pretty sure had a big impact in Hawkwind, as a lot of effects sounded like it came off a Hawkwind album (a lot of these similar spacy electronic effects could be heard on albums from Gong, and more recently Ozric Tentacles). Of course Pink Floyd did have a couple earlier space rock anthems, &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; and &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;, but it was with this song that was expanded on and even more fully realized. The last half is Nick Mason, which is the weakest, him just playing on percussion and little else just doesn't cut it. While Ummagumma isn't something I'd listen to everyday, it's truly one of the most fascinating albums I have ever heard, and the only albums I think can top this one in strangeness is some of Tangerine Dream's earliest works, like Zeit. So if you want strange, get Ummagumma, but if you want a tuneful Pink Floyd, look elsewhere.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Orson Welles' classic film depicting William Randolph Hearst's life, a man striving to regain his childhood, is a great film from both a technical, and a writing perspective.  Welle's incredible directing has been used as the basis for all great directing of our time.  His use of low/high angle shots, flashbacks, deep focus, and contrast are widley used nowadays. Not only is it a great movie, but a great DVD with two commentaries, and a great 2 hour documentary &quot;the battle over citizen kane.&quot;  Also, for those reviewers that dont like the fact that the movie isn't presented in widescreen...the film was made in 1941!! it was NEVER shown in widescreen!!!
B00005R2M3|4.0|I was first introduced to the music of Shakira when I moved to Costa Rica five years ago.  Her first CD, \\"Pies Descalzos\\", was a a huge hit here, as it was throughout Latin America.  She followed this up with a slightly different, but equally successful CD, \\"Dónde están los ladrones?\\", produced by Emilio Estefan (Gloria's husband), and then with an MTV Unplugged CD.  Under the guidance of the Estefans, Shakira learned English so that she could conquer the English-speaking market, and \\"Laundry Service\\" is her first foray into that market.<br />Shakira is a major-league talent.  She is Colombian, with a Lebanese father, and her genius lies in her ability to fuse pop, rock, and various rhythms from different countries in an original and sophisticated way to produce immanently catchy songs which people of different cultures can identify with.  Prominent examples of this are found on her second CD, where she uses a Mexican mariachi sound on \\"Ciega, sordomuda\\" and an Arabian sound on \\"Ojos Asi\\" (my personal favorite Shakira song, an English version of which appears as \\"Eyes Like That\\" on Laundry Service, translated by Gloria Estefan).  On Laundry Service she also uses Peruvian flute sounds on \\"Whenever, wherever\\", the first single from the CD.  And it is appropriate that for a CD aimed at a North American audience, one can hear, for the first time from Shakira, distinctly American sounds.  A surf guitar sound appears on two songs, reminiscent of the guitar intro of Kenny Loggins' \\"Footloose.\\"<br />Whoever compared Shakira to Alanis Morrisette doesn't really know Shakira's music.  Unless you can say that anyone who sings a song or two about unrequited love is like Alanis, they are not in any way comparable. Her phrasing in a couple of songs reminds me of the lead singer for No Doubt, though I certainly wouldn't categorize her as being like anyone else.  Her voice is powerful and unique.<br />Shakira has become more commercial over the years - she has dyed her hair blondeand she shakes her hips a lot in her music videos.  But she is no Britney Spears clone.  She is an intelligent, sophisticated artist who writes her own music, and her music is original.  Having listened to \\"Laundry Service\\" three or four times now, I like it a great deal, though it doesn't grab me as much as her first two.  This may come with time, however - I didn't like the second one so much when it first came out, and it eventually became my favorite.  But you really can't go wrong with any of her CDs - they are all top-notch.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Though this movie does not stand well compared to episodes 4, 5, and 6, it is still a decent movie (and would have been much better had there been less anakin and less jar-jar binks).  It has a good story line (and saying there is no plot is erelevant because so did the earlier movies) and GREAT CGI. Also, i hate to comment on another review but had this movie premeired back when star wars did...it would definitely NOT be a flop, the exact opposite, it would have no hype whatsoever therefore no other movies to live up to.  Had someone watched this movie without knowing about the previous films, i think they would have enjoyed it.<br />  The DVD is great though.  good commentary, good LONG featurette, and many deleted scenes, some of them were put back into the film (its a directors cut) i heared george lucas also took out some of the anakin-jar-jar scenes.
B000023X9W|4.0|Yes, it is not the Young we know. And yes, I still like him.
6304698658|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you have to watch it. It's a classic. I've been watching in for years with my family. We break it out on Thanksgiving and play it repeatedly over the following month. <BR>Like some others have said, the DVD version isn't the best quality, but I bought it just because my VHS version had been watched so many times, and for the durability factor. I hope they re-release it some day &quot;digitally remastered&quot;, or whatever they do. Get this movie and you will not be disappointed.

B000007XUQ|5.0|CHRISTMAS COLLECTION is the only jazz standard album that karen carpenter ever recorded and it is a masterpiece-equal to ella fitzgeralds famed SONGBOOK albums.these 2 albums were recorded in 1978{except for 3 instrumental tracks added in 1984},and utilize jazz and symphonic orchestras on this stellar collection of torch and swing arrangements.More of these jazz-type arrangements can be found on VOICE OF THE HEART and LOVELINES.Outtakes from the CHRISTMAS PORTRAIT sessions{ &quot;look to your dreams &quot; , &quot;little girl blue&quot;,etc} were included on those 2 albums.
0316779237|4.0|Heartwarming stories of Christmas are common - tales of holiday cheer, families coming together to celebrate, and perhaps an unexpected miracle.  This book doesn't have those stories.<br />Rather, what it has is a laugh-out-loud funny look at David Sedaris's stint as a SantaLand elf at Macy's in New York City.  This story is both believable and uproarious, and shouldn't be missed.  Any holiday shopper needing a pick-me-up from the hour-long lines at the mall will certainly get it from this story!<br />The most poignant of the stories is contained within the chapter called (if you can believe it), Dinah the Christmas Whore.  This story points out the importance of serving others, and how families can come together.  <br />The four other chapters are worth reading for an interesting, if cynical, look at the role of the season in contemporary culture.  They aren't nearly as enjoyable as the other two, and have some dark twists, so do be forewarned.
B000006NUW|5.0|I bought this Box set a few years back and haven't stopped listening to it since. Born in '66 I had never realized that most all my favorite 60's pop songs were from Motown. Also, It turned me on to lesser known Motown artists and had me seeking out their individual discs. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED, NOR WILL THE LUCKY PEOPLE YOU GIVE THIS BOX SET TO.
B00003CXE6|1.0|Ugh. I consider this movie a total waste of time for anyone who has been to see more than 10 movies in their lifetime. That's because anyone who might have,has seen every lame trick in this movie used again and again. I don't know where to begin as the list would be too long.I prefer the real life action like Ultimate street brawls at least thats real.<BR>I liked Russell in LA Confidential and that's about it. The mere thought of him having a Best Actor trophy makes me shudder.I mean, come on-all he had to do to prepare for this role was cut out 5 hours of sleep every night. His routine with the scowling and talking raspy got so old after the first half-hour, I still ask myself why I didn't leave the theatre at any point thereafter. My bad. <BR>I will give the movie credit for the few fightscenes that came across as very brutal and somewhat epic, but these moments are basically few and far between. Sets are pretty much flawless and the costumes are well done, both of which create total believability in the environments. Ok, enough with the compliments.
B00005R62N|5.0|First of all let me say that Unleashed in the East is a great record and is the best live record by Priest. it kicks off with Exciter, probably the first real speed metal recording. Next is runnig Wild, and this versoin sounds twice as heavy as the one on Hell Bent for Leather. Sinner is next, and is one of the best songs on Unleashed, and has an awesome solo with lots of different effects done by K.K. Sinner is followed by The Ripper, Green Manalisi, and Diamonds and Rust, all exeptionally done. Victim of changes is next. WOW !!!!. A very powerful song. The riff is great too. Genocide is next and has exeptional guitar work done by Glenn Tipton throughout the song. Then Tyrant. The last solo is simply amazing. Just listen to them playing it at the same time. Then come the bonus tracks, Rock Forever, Delivering the Goods, Hell Bent for Leather, and Starbreaker. All of the bonus tracks are great, but they were all released before on the Japanese version of Unleashed called Priest in the East, and most Priest fans probably had that one already. It would've been nice to hear tracks like Dissident Aggressor, Stained Class, Beyond the Realms of Death. I really hoped to see more of Stained Class on this remaster because Stained Class is favourite Judas Priest album, with Unleashed being the second. This remaster sounds a little better than the original one, u can hear the drums and the base better. The drummer Les Binks is simply amazing! Too bad he left JP a short time after this album's release. He even does double-base drumming, which was very rare in the 1970's. Unleased won't dissapoint!
B00005RIKD|4.0|The way the old favorites have been re-worked is quite clever and a very welcome change, although if I never hear another Police song, no matter how much it's changed, I'll be just fine. Sting has so many excellent pieces post-Police that I don't know why he continues to toss those things out to us. Guess it's for the &quot;fans&quot;. <br />Why not five stars for this? Too much baggage with the band. If he could have left out the backup singers, drop Kipper and his toys, lose the cello, and mixed the Hammond B-3 organ a lot more prominently, this would be an amazing set. Yes, there's a definite jazz feel to many of the items, but with the horns and B-3, there's a real Memphis R&amp;B groove at times that should have been exploited. The solos were too short. These cats sounded like they really wanted to cut loose, but just couldn't get over the hump; maybe 9-11 was dragging them down. Jason Rebello on piano has some nice moments, with obvious heavy Lyle Mays influence, maybe a little too obvious. Manu Katche is OK on the skins, but let's face it, he's no Vinny Coluita.
B00005RDAF|2.0|I Love Britney and I think she's amazing but this DVD is NOT worth the money. I was expecting to feature all her videos from &quot;Baby one more time&quot; to &quot;Not a girl&quot; but it only has 3 actual videos on it. The DVD runs a total of 27 minutes and includes a Pepsi commercial which I'm upset cause they didn't include the actual 2 1/2 minute version one. This ones only 1 1/2 minutes. the only good thing about this DVD is that it's Britney and the sequences that they did are really cool.
B00005QW4K|5.0|Girl, &quot;But I thought you said I was pretty...&quot;<br />Ash, &quot;Honey, you got real ugly.&quot;<br />One of my all time favorite quotes from Ash's final adventure with the Necronomicon. After the unfortunate opening of a time portal in the prequal Evil Dead II, Ash must pull himself together, new arm included, and battle the deadites. More comedy than horror, Army of Darkness is devoted to those fans of quirky and often violent humor, and no specific taste is necessary to savor the gritty expression's. Definately a Saturday or Sunday afternoon flick of the highest form.<br />Despite the previous 2's blatant/effective uses of gore for humor, Army of Darkness relies on wit and obviously time consuming special effect's. It barely earn's the R rating! If only for an off-camera shotgun blast to the face (believe it or not, daffy-duck can do the same without an R rating), I am sure another rating would have been given.<br />Bootleg this bad boy, and play it to the bone!<br />&quot;Give me some sugar, baby.&quot;
0345350499|5.0|I thought this was a very good perspective of arthurian legend.  While it took me a considerable amount of time to read it, I couldn't put it down.  Some people seemed to dislike the book because of it's anti-christian view, but it isnt so much against christianity,  but against christianity during the time period and the priests.  I found it to be very well written, and though it is sometimes difficult to remember who is related to who or who specific characters are, it is definitely worth reading.
B0000025DV|5.0|This is probably my favorite ELO disk and may be my all time favorite disk period.  I saw ELO in concert twice, the first time at Glassboro State College just after Roll Over Beethove hit the charts and the second time in Phila during the Out of the Blue tour.  At the Phila concert, when the top of the flying saucer began to rise with the lasers and strobes flashing, I could not believe my eyes and ears, what a rush. This is the ultimate ELO disk. It has that fantastic mix of driving rock and classical from the fertile mind of Jeff Lynn and company which gave ELO their unique sound.  If you want to sample ELO, this is the disk to get.
6305657947|5.0|Very light but thoughtful. Crisp but well textured. It might not be the most convincing story, but it does not have to be given the delicious twists and stylish direction.<br />Brosnan might not be more handsome than Alec Baldwin, but with his knowing smiles and cunning eyes, he fits his part as Thomas Crown perfectly. And Rene Russo? What more can I say? I cannot agree more with the previous reviewers: beautiful, confident, sexy, emotional and everything.<br />The photography and score are excellent. I especially like the scene where Crown wretched his hundred thousand dollar boat just to catch a splash. Red sail and yellow wind breaker against the blue ocean. What a feast. And the &quot;let's play ball&quot; scene where Crown &quot;put&quot; back the Monet is a pure excitment, no less because of the delightful accompanying soundtrack &quot;Sinnerman.&quot;<br />Overall, a very enjoyable movie. It might not be the kind of movie that would &quot;change your life.&quot; But it's definitely a movie that can refresh you and make you smile.
B00005A46T|4.0|After not being all too thrilled by their debut album, I wasn't sure what to expect with &quot;Iowa&quot;.  I had heard it be compared to Slayer's classic &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; in terms of extreme metal, and I did not believe it.  WHile &quot;Iowa&quot; isn't on the same level of creativity as &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, I will say this, Slipknot is not just another trend metal band.  Behind the masks and outfits there is a real band, and a good band at that.  &quot;Heretic Anthem&quot;, &quot;New Abortion&quot;, and my favorite, the epic 15 minute title track, are Slipknot's best songs ever.  In terms of ferocity, the band is explosive, and the riffs and beats are pounding, Joey Jordinson is one of the best drummers in metal today, and it shows throughout the album.  Slipknot's &quot;Iowa&quot; is what Slayer's &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; was 15 years ago, the most extreme metal release on a major label.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|\\"Moulin Rouge\\" marks the return of Baz Luhrmann, the man who made Shaekspeare hip for the MTV generation with \\"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet\\". Whilst he has a lot to answer for in terms of his influence on how Shakespeare has since been portrayed (I recently saw a production of \\"Othello\\" that played the Pretenders' \\"Don't Get Me Wrong\\" seventeen times before the play began), with \\"Moulin Rouge\\" he gives us a full-blooded, intoxicatingly frenetic reminder of why the moviegoing public swooned in the first place. Infusing the classy tragic lovestory trappings of the melodramatic musical with twentieth century love songs, the result is an all-out riot.<br />The setting is nineteenth century Paris at the infamous Moulin Rouge club, made so for its penchant for pantie-less can-can dancers. Luhrmann, however, throws every modern filmmaking trick into the book to free up a risque bohemian spirit that spreads itself throughout the film in a massive chaotic sweep. Everything is increasingly weird and wonderful to behold, from the giant elephant that holds home to Nicole Kidman to the deceptively huge nightclub itself. And the musical numbers are wonderfully performed as well as being very witty; revelations include an early floorshow mix of \\"Lady Marmalade\\" and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and Kidman and Ewan McGregor's \\"Elephant Love Medley\\", a bold medley of classic songs that could have gone terribly wrong. It is a testament to Luhrmann and his team that they never ever do.<br />Performances all around are faultless. Kidman and McGregor throw themselves into the film mercilessly, at first appearing as deranged and gaudy as the caricatures around them, until the film's second act shifts into darker dramatic territory and they are required to deliver the goods. Kidman does so with gusto, earning the majority of the scenes and some truly ravishing costumes, but McGregor is just as wonderful, and the finale couldn't have packed any punch that it has without him. Standoutsfrom the supporting cast include Jim Broadbent, possibly the best British actor around (an Oscar nomination please!), and Richard Roxburgh as the shy-but-villainous Duke.<br />The only real problem is that \\"Moulin Rouge\\" has an acquired taste: whilst it marries the absinthe-strewn freakishness well with the timeless musical qualities very well, they are still two disparate elements that some people won't wholly register with. People I know have remarked \\"Oh it was so good, but it was really weird in places\\" whilst others have said \\"It was really funny and witty but the romantic bits were slow and boring\\". One noted male remark that I found funny was: \\"That movie is so gay, man!\\" But what \\"Moulin Rouge\\" serves up is so unlike anything around, and should be praised for that, especially in a season of redundant sequels and remakes. Cult Classic status beckons.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|I really liked this CD.  The music is reviewed elsewhere, so I won't be redundant.  I first got the Limited version, and I describe it here:  It is in a red leatherette folder which reminds me of the red slipcase edition of LOTR.  Open it, and there are two pockets.  One holds the CD, and the other holds a small booklet with Elvish/English lyrics from the soundtrack as well as pictures from the movie.  This booklet and case are exclusive to the Limited Edition.<BR>  The CD itself can be played on computer to go to a special website where you can view trailers, interviews, etc...  This is VERY nice, but be warned--the regular priced CD also has this feature.<BR>  As to the regular priced CD, the first run of these are packaged with a card depicting one of 6 characters:  Frodo, Bilbo, Strider, Arwen, Gandalf, and Saruman.  The card is on the cover of the CD, so you know which one you get.  Completist geeks will want all 6 versions, as these are very nice cards.  The folder in this version is not quite as nice as the limited edition's booklet, but you get the essential information.  And, yes, the CD is enhanced for use on the computer in this version.<BR>  It is not clear if future pressings of the CD will be enhanced, and I don't expect the cards to be in subsequent runs.<BR>  So now you know it all!  Which one or ones are you gonna buy!
B00005QK3W|4.0|This album's songs came to Paul from the same places they have always come.  If you own at least one Beatles' record, you'll enjoy this one just as much.  Like a good book it keeps you captivated with tight mood swings.  It truly cooks.  What an accomplishment by such a gifted artist.  Tired of all the (...) that's being hailed as great then when you take a listen and you're like Huh?  He's got (...) to make such a record.  I'm sure Paul feels really strong about these song's and everyone else that worked with him on it. He worked with a new young band and sung and played bass just like he did with the Beatles'.  Live with no bass overdubs.  Look what's on the charts now and weep.  Then go out and buy \\"Driving Rain\\".  True arsistic intent is hard to find.
0060930187|5.0|After discovering that my English teacher shared some of my tastes in literature, I asked her to recommend me another book to read and &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; came up. This is one of the best novels I have read in a long time. Plath's writing is almost poetic, and the overall novel is such a beautiful reflection of her life. Although depressing (the novel almost brought me to tears twice), after reading it I felt a great sense of satisfaction. Although this is a biography of the authors life, this novel mirrors many issues that every young woman will go through, and for this reason, amongst many, I strongly recommend that every girl, teen and woman reads this novel (I'm not sure if the average male would enjoy reading it). Plath obviously puts her heart and soul into her writing, and it shows, so I, as a reader, was able to empathise with the author on so many levels that this novel has left a mark on my mind that will probably stay there forever. *sigh* I'm addicted to good reading...
B00005214X|5.0|This is the album of all time. Introspective lyrics, beautiful melodies, wonderful music and lush production. If you want to know the meaning of life, your current journey and destination, take a , no - you will take many a, listen to this masterpiece. My words cannot do it justice. 5 plus stars. After all these years since its release it still sounds so fresh and apt for these times.  You will be captivated and in rapture (cloud nine).
0806930152|5.0|This is a book anyone who is serious about drawing should not have in their library. It's a great resource to learn about anatomy for artist. Very comprehensive in scope to make one's drawing aesthetically beautiful. The book isn't just about life drawing, it's strong in drawing foundations which every artist should have.This book will also save you lots of time collecting books on life drawing because it covers the major areas of figure drawing. This is a book that comprise from all 6 of bridgeman's books. his other books are great for portability but i recommend this one so you don't have so many books laying around.
B00005QK3W|1.0|I hate to see this happen again. It's like a nightmare that never ends. Another Paul McCartney record. Another flop. What a turn off! Every single time the man releases a new record you keep asking yourself: Will he make it this time? But nothing really happens. I'm sorry Paul. I'm still your fan. You've got one of the greatest voices, either for ballads or rock'n'roll standards, but you haven't written anything listenable from, let's say, &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and the &quot;Band On The Run&quot; album. Let's face it. This was thirty years ago. You don't have to prove anything else to anybody. You've done it great, but you've lost it.
0385505833|5.0|For those reviewers intent on pointing out Grisham's research errors, all I can say is &quot;Bah-humbug!&quot;  From the taut suspense of &quot;The Partner&quot; to the colorfully drawn era of &quot;A Painted House&quot;, Grisham has always been able to keep our interest with characters whose motivations seem very like our own, or at least like someone we know.  In &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;, Grisham brings us a tale that is very believable in its motivations.  Who among us hasn't bellyached about the madness of the holiday season?<br />Something different from Grisham's other books, this is a short gift of a tale, a one-sitting fable that reminds us to keep our priorities right in the midst of holiday chaos.  Luther and Nora Krank are wonderful protagonists, entwined in their own plot to skip Christmas.  The ending, if a bit predictable, is still likely to bring laughs and tears.  Grisham touches us in a simple and effective manner.  My wife and I, joined on the couch, had to put the book down a couple of times to regain control after particularly comedic scenes.  (Did I mention wiping my eyes on my sleeves?) Through it's simplicity, the story works, the message sinks in, and--if I'm one to predict the future--the TV movie will be out by next Yuletide.  (Yes, my wife and I will watch.)
B000000WA4|5.0|The pumpkins's double disc classic. amazing, so amazing it's scary. It's hard to conceive that anyone could make an album this good. This is the best album of all time. tonight, tonight, jellybelly, porcelina, xyu, thirty-threee, 1979, by starlight, they are all excellent. too bad the pumpkins have broken up.

067144901X|5.0|I worked in a day care center with toddlers aged 14 months to 36 months.  The day care center had a really huge selection of baby books for the toddlers, but this book and another book that featured different types of dog barks were the favorites.  The younger toddlers kept carrying these books over to me so they could hear me make funny sounds.  Many of the older toddlers loved imitating all of the animal sounds.  I should also add that I think the kids really prefer this more when you really try to sound like the animals and sing the la-la-la part instead of just saying &quot;Moo, Baa, LaLaLa&quot; like some people do.

0385505833|5.0|Great story.  Would make an excellent Christmas TV special.
B00005NOOH|5.0|This is an unbelievable price for the greatest documentary ever compiled on the Second World War.Worth every penny!Five Stars.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I recieved this as an early christmas gift from my mom's friend Carroll! When I listened to it, I thought it was fantastic. Some of my favorite song's are Another year has gone by, the magic of christmas day &amp; these are the special times! So if you're in for some grea holiday music then buy Celine's christmas album (this one) and you don't have to just listen to it at christmas you can listen to it any day, wether you're waiting for christmas to come, or something:-) This CD is the best!
B00003CXDD|5.0|An ancient prophecy tells of a sacred child that will bring an end to the reign of the evil Queen Bavmorda(Jean Marsh).  The sacred child is smuggled out of the castle and finds her way to Willow Ufgood(Warwick Davis).  He leaves his village on a quest to return the baby but he becomes trapped in the middle of a battle beween good and evil.  With the help of Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) Willow must protect the baby from the queen and her daughter Sorsha (Joanne Whalley) and fulfill the prophecy.<br />Willow has received a very nice transfer that is a step up from the old laser disk.  It is presented in Anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1).  There is no edge enhancement and very little grain which is amazing for a picture from 1988.  The sound however doesnt make use of the surrounds.  Very few times are the rear speakers used.  The film is in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround.<br />The audio commentary by Warwick Davis is very informative and every fan of the movie should listen to it.  I just wish that George Lucas and Ron Howard participated as well.  Two great featurettes are included along with several trailers and stills.  Unlike most fantasy movies it is suited for all ages.  Willow is a movie that I grew up with and today am still very fond of it.  This film has it all, action, adventure, comedy and romance.  Highly recommended.
B000002KB8|3.0|Music that talks about evil and satanism is not usually my cup of tea. However, this debut album by Black Sabbath has many captivating moments. The strongest track to my ears in the opening track simply titled Black Sabbath. The thunderstorms and church bells set a mystical and scary atmosphere. The power chords played at different volume levels have me wondering,\\"What evil lurks behind these walls?\\" Then Ozzy's voice tells it all. His hellium like tone just sets the mood. The dark black figure is after him. Then a tempo shift adds some more substance to this piece and an awesome guitar solo adds the final piece to this scary tune....<br />As for the rest of the songs/tracks on this album, there are certainly some highs and lows. The Wizzard is a bit monotonous but does feature some good drumming by Bill Ward. N.I.B. is probably the highlight of the next suite of songs. Some captivating solos indeed. Wicked World has some interesting tone shifts. The last suite of songs has a little too much excess in the guitar solo area. However, the parts where Ozzy sings are somewhat captivating.<br />Certainly a must for fans of Heavy Metal as it has a wide appeal of influence to the many metal bands of the 80's and 90's.
0679721037|5.0|The debate rages on to this day on whether or not the U.S. was justified in dropping the atomic bombs on Japan in 1945. John Hersey's &quot;Hiroshima&quot; paints a realistic picture of the bomb dropped on that city as told in a narrative style about six victims, including a priest, two doctors, a poor widow, and a young female factory worker.<br />Some currently share the opinion that Japan was going to surrender even before the bombs were dropped. Others still believe in what this book points to in one of its sections as &quot;total war&quot; being practiced by Japan at that time, where there &quot;was no difference between civilians and soldiers&quot;. The bomb, in this case, was needed to save American lives and Japan from total destruction.<br />This book leaves the debate to the reader as it shows what did happen to tens of thousands of people after the bomb fell on Hiroshima. Instant death, pro-longed suffering, and total destruction of property are portrayed in its pages. This book is a MUST READ for all people -- all nations. Readers can witness the human tragedy behind a nuclear solution. This book, written shortly after the war and updated, will leave all who read it shaken and praying that this event will never happen again for any reason.
B000002U3P|4.0|I bought this after seeing the movie, because I enjoyed the rollicking, beat-heavy Lust For Life.  But there are many more worthwhile tunes.  It is heavy on the Rave/Techno tunes, and if you need something for your next rave party, this is sure to be a hit.  But it isn't only Rave tunes on this CD, it has the signature ambient sounds of Brian Eno's Deep Blue Sea, the frail wimperings of Lou Reed's Perfect Day, and a sort-of Rock tune with Atomic, that, in my opinion, is better than Debbie Harry's version.
0783226063|1.0|DUNE.... say that name. Say it again.<br />Okay, now, go read the book and throw that rental of the movie into the fire. If there was ever a better example of how the movie industry almost always manages to screw up a good book, I have absolutely no idea what it is.<br />Dune, the book, was a remarkable experience in reading pleasure. It took a great plot, spiced it up a lot with superb characters, and powered it with the reader's imagination. The result was a modern classic that nobody could say a word against. So, naturally, when I heard about the movie, I figured that it would top everything that I had seen - Alien, Saving Private Ryan, The Matrix, you name it. I was dead wrong.<br />Dune is a story about young Paul Atreides, son of a duke and a distant cousin of the Lion Throne, the highest ranking in the known universe. In a political move, the Emperor recently gave the Atreides house control of the planet Arrakis, or Dune. Arrakis is the only known planet that produces melange, a rare spice that is supposed to enhance the senses and can form a deadly addiction. This makes it valuable beyond belief. This is good for Paul and his father, Duke Atreides, because it means profits galore, but the evil House Harkonnen has their eye on it too - and they will do anything to take it. This leads off to a huge battle between the houses and the utter annhilation of the Atreides, save for Paul and a few others. Now, after learning of the true nature of the invasion and the traitor that helped destroy his family, Paul has started a quest for revenge.<br />This premise worked great for the book. Herbert managed to fill it with a multitude of twists and turns and packed it with detail. The movie, however, leaves a lot of huge plot holes; obviously, director Dino de Laurentiis (or however it's spelt) assumed that everybody had read the book and would be able to figure it out. However, the only reason I understood much of the movie is because I'd practically memorized the book;the presentation is that bad. It gets worse, too - the acting is absolutely atrocious. Paul Atreides is prone to severe overacting; Chani is very bland; heck, even Patrick Stewart, who normally steals the show in everything he is in, did a terrible job. Of course, they probably would have done better if the script wasn't [terrible]<br />Do you owe it to yourself to get the book? Yes. Do you owe it to yourself to never even have to watch the movie? Yes, you sure as heck do.<br />PROS: Some decent special effects.<br />CONS: Just about everything else. Abysmal writing, abysmal acting, abysmal directing, and horrible omissions from the book.<br />BOTTOM LINE:  STAY AWAY.
B000002W5J|3.0|Don't get me wrong.  There are some very strong tracks on this release.  The Grace Slick sung Somebody To Love and White Rabbitt are excellent mesmerizing tunes with some awesome instrumentation.  She Has Funny Cars and Your My Best Friend are fairly catchy as well.  And the instrumental Embryonic Journey is certainly quite ear pleasing with some nice guitar effects.<br />However ther psychedelic tone could vary a little.  The arrangements sound fairly similar and the drums don't kick hard in any one song.  Whereas there are some very good guitar solos, there are some moments when the guitars don't do anything special for me.  And tracks like Commin' Back To Me, Today, and How Do You Feel are really quite dull.  There is very little tune to any of them.  I prefer the live version of Plastic Fantastic Lover to the one included on Surrealistic Pillow(although this version is certainly not bad).<br />Diehard fans of the Airplane should pick this one up, but moderate fans should consider a compilation such as Worst Of which really has all the essential songs.
B00005214X|5.0|Before I write this review, I want to express my sympathy and sadness due to George's death.  He will be missed by all of us music fans.  <br />I bought this cd last spring and I have been listening to it again constantly after hearing of his passing.  His songs are spiritual and also some rockers on this 2 cd set also.  I believe it is George's finest solo effort and I must say that I also think it rivals anything that any of the other beatles did in their solo efforts.  I believe George was a very able and competent song writer and this album proves it.  His lyrics make you think and this album seems to me to have a deeper meaning than just another album full of rock songs.  George was an underrated musician but to me the beatles without George just would not have been the same.  He added a mysterious, funny, and spiritual side to the group and not to mention some of the most memorable guitar riffs in rock history.  This album will help you to keep part of George in your heart and through his music he will always be with us.  If you liked the beatles and George Harrison, I recommend  you get your hands on this cd and get to know George through the music that he loved.  I think he would have liked it that way.  <br />God bless you George, we all love
B000008GEF|4.0|Although not up to the greatness of &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; &quot;Living in the Material World&quot; still contains many strong songs.  &quot;Sue Me, Sue You Blues&quot; is in the spirit of &quot;Taxman&quot; only better--skewering the legal system and the absurdity of the Beatles suing each other.  &quot;Don't Let Me Wait Too Long,&quot; as someone else points out, could easily have been a single--an upbeat, infectious song about love.  &quot;Living in the Material World,&quot; the song, has a beautiful bridge with only tabla, flute and George's voice; it's supposed to sound spiritual--and it works!  Speaking of which, one criticism of this recording I hear is that it's too religious. I disagree.  First, only a few songs use words with overtly religious content.  And with those that do, they don't interfere with the enjoyment of the music.  If the lyrics of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; don't bother you, then these songs shouldn't either.<br />On first listen, this recording may seem slow, but the songs grow on you.  There are many pretty melodies and George's superb guitar is in evidence throughout.  The only song I find pedantic is &quot;That's All&quot;--the final one.  Otherwise, they all are good music.<br />For anyone contemplating a George Harrison solo, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is definitely the one.  But &quot;Material World&quot; is my second favorite.
B0000507UD|5.0|It is now ok to be the real, mature immature, stupid rude jerk that is actually how everyone feels but never had the self confidence to be.  Yeah, no stupidly sappy sad serious drama-get over your parents and be the rude jerk that you honestly are-I can sing &quot;yeah&quot; to that song better than any lyric in anyother song anywhere.  Yeah.
B00005LQ6S|4.0|When i first saw the previews for Highlander Endgame, I was completely amazed that they were going to have a Highlander movie that both included Christopher Lambert as Connor MacLeod from the movie series, and Adrian Paul as Duncan MacLeod from the tv series. But when i went to the theater and saw the movie, I knew that there were at least 6 or 7 takes that were shown in previews that i didnt see in the actual movie. They looked like good scenes too. That disappointed me. Although it was a good movie with a good plot, good acting and good fight scenes, I think it would of done better with the deleted scenes put back in.<BR> I'm disappointed in the way they ended this movie, the way they gave Adrian Paul alot more time onscreen then Christopher Lambert, and how they had Christopher Lambert's first fight scene in the movie done between him and the enemy, Jacob Kell(Bruce Payne). Connor MacLeod was completely defenseless against Jacob who was overpowering Connor easily. Duncan MacLeod, however had some great fight scenes done. The fight scene between him and the renegade immortals was great. And Duncan fighting Jin Ke(Donnie Yen) was one of the best fight scenes I had ever scene, mixing in two different weapons.<BR> I was glad that they included characters from the show. Jim Byrnes as Joe Dawson, and Peter Wingfield as Methos. Although their time onscreen was kept farely short, the way they had their acting mix in with Adrian Paul was just like from the series. Bruce Payne was great as the overpowering enemy, Jacob Kell, who wanted revenge on Connor MacLeod for killing a man of God, who raised Jacob as his own son. Jacob was responsible for the death of Connor's mother, and adopted daughter Rachael. Lisa Barbuscia played Kate, who wanted revenge on Duncan MacLeod for giving her no choice of immortality. Because of Kate's equal hatred for Duncan, to Jacob's hatred for Connor, Kell is assisted by Kate. From the producer's of the original Highlander movie, Highlander Endgame is a great movie to watch.
0060012331|3.0|This is set in Discworld, but the tone and satire of the other Discworld novels is missing.  The book appears to be written for an 8th grade reader, (high Harry Potter to low George Orwell).  The story was a little more serious than The Rats of NIMH, but an easier read than Tailchaser's Song.  I don't recommend it to adults, nor is it a &quot;junior&quot; introduction to Discworld for the junior high reader.  It is a quiet, solid, story.  If you are looking for the humor of Discworld, you'll be disappointed
B00003CXRM|2.0|If you are planning to have a nice night, with a good movie, I don't think you should pick 'O Brother Where Art Thou'.  Its pretty funny, but there was really no plot.  In one scene the 3 fugitives see these ladies who start singing and seducing them.  In my teenage perspective, I don't want to see some old dudes being seduced by beautiful women. (George Clooney is hot though)  I was laughing a lot of the time, but I did not understand this at all.  Every couple of minutes I was like, where did this dude come from? My mom and I were in tears we were laughing so hard after the movie was over, cuz we didn't get it AT ALL.  Especially the whole flood thing... if you just want a laugh without the annoyance of actual substance, then this is the movie for you!
0061040967|4.0|The illustrations are good, but occasionally a little distracting and unecessary.  The story is true Discworld, with satire and references.  When you remove all the illustrations, the book would only be about 70 pages (a novelette?)  I liked the story, but I hope this isn't the future of Terry Pratchett's output.  I'd rather wait 18 months for a novel that 9 months for an illustrated short story.
B00000J7J4|5.0|OK, this is a great album, but I think that I could make a good album if you gave me Lauryn Hill, Everlast, Dave Matthews, Rob Thomas, Wyclef Jean, Eagle Eye Cherry, Eric Clapton, and The Product G&B.  The best song on here is \\"Put Your Lights On\\" feat. Everlast.  It would freak the living (...) out of me if I were a little kid.  \\"Maria Maria\\" and \\"Smooth\\" are great songs, but they got WAY too overplayed, so now I don't like them as much.  \\"Do You Like The Way\\" feat. Lauryn Hill is a really good rap song, and I usually don't like it when Lauryn Hill raps.  The bottom line is, this is one heck of an album(even though I don't think it deserved 8 Grammys).  This isn't a Santana album though because it's just an all-star cast of musicians where Santana happens to be playing guitar.
B00005AFVR|5.0|Bruce opened the Tribute To Heroes concert for the Sept. 11 victims, and is there any doubt why? Springsteen has been by far the most eloquent and powerful of songwriters and performers when it comes to the blue collar American experience. Every song, every performance drips with REALness, even when they don't always hit their full stride. The guy is worth hundreds of millions, but he still loves giving marathon performances. That's the love. Bruce -- and this concert album -- are the antidote to 'NSYNC, Britney et al, and about the best thing to cure your Sept. 11 blues that I can imagine.<br />Enjoy!
B00005RFAI|5.0|I bought it for the dance tune - Get the Party Started. I'm<BR>a 40 year old who still loves dance music. It is the rest of<BR>the disk that really has me hooked.  Track number 14, My Vietnam<BR>is outstanding.  These are songs with something to say, and<BR>something worth listening to.

0393317552|5.0|Diamond probably should have named this book &quot;Domesticatable Plants and Animals, Germs, and Migrations&quot;.  Even so, it is one of the best histories of world I have ever read.  He builds a convincing case for geographical determinism as the source of cultural and technological differences between the peoples of the world.<br />Diamond describes the widely different inheritances of edible plants and domesticatable animals in geographic regions.  The inevitable force of human ingenuity led to a package of food crops, farm animals, and epidemic diseases posessed by the inhabitants of these areas.  This inheritance enabled inundation and replacement of peoples who were less fortunate in what the earth offered them.  If you have ever wondered why Europeans conquered the world in the 1800's, why China is relatively homogenous, why indigenous Australians were technologically backwards, why the Americas' indigenous people were virtually exterminated, and why Africans were not given the same treatment, this book is for you.  A great rebuttal to racialist theories of cultural variation.
6302054982|5.0|Martin Scorsese's greatness as a director would be established if this was the only film he ever made. How does one even begin to praise this masterpiece that simply has no weaknesses?  The casting and script writing of &quot;Good Fellas&quot; are near perfect, and the story based on the true life experiences of Henry Hill provides us with a brutal and unsentimental view of a social milieu that is both treacherous and violent.  These are not men of honor, but ruthless back stabbers who don't hesitate to betray close friends for a few pieces of silver.  Ray Liotta splendidly portrays Hill as a man who joins the mob as a teenager for the excitement and fast money.  Those like Jimmy Conway (Robert Di Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) befriend Hill in their own dubious manner.  Hill looks upon them as brothers, but it seems they merely perceive him as a fellow party animal who aptly carries out his responsibilities to the group.  Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill is a woman who marries her man knowing full well about his dangerous side.  Hill introduces his wife to drugs and often places her in harm's way.  Their marriage is a never ending dysfunctional disaster.  It totally redefines the meaning of family values.<br />This is not a film for someone seeking a romanticized depiction of organized crime. These people are monsters who prey on their fellow citizens.  Scorsese refuses to pretend that they have many redeeming qualities.  Their virtues are few and far between,  and one only regrets that it takes so long for the authorities to put them behind bars.  Hill's later entry into a federal witness protection program is hard to swallow.  &quot;Good Fellas&quot; is hard hitting and honest.  I easily place it among the top one hundred movies of all time.
B000002KAT|5.0|I dont really see how anyone cannot like this album. It has no stand out songs because it is one song cycle meant to be heard all at once.  I guess those that criticise it think Coltrane is non musical noise.  <BR>Instrumentation is great especially acoustic bass and drums but i also like that droning string thing used on a couple of songs.<br />The lyrics are not specificly about anything but they are great at conjuring up your own feelings about things, much like impressionism.  (You have to have some kind of imagination)<br />Definately his best batch of songs, im not really a fan of the hits though
B00000D9TK|5.0|I have listened to C&eacute;line since the 1980s and love all of her albums (but the French albums are much better). C&eacute;line's previous album with Jean-Jacques Goldman, D'eux (the French Album in the United States) contained several beautiful songs but it was not one of my favourites.<br />However, C&eacute;line's second collaboration with Goldman on S'il suffisait d'aimer has track after track of standout lyrics and vocals. It's hard to pick a favourite song from such an accomplished album (4 000 000 albums sold worldwide), but here are some of my absolute favourites: On ne change pas, Terre, Tous les blues sont &eacute;crits pour toi, and Je crois toi.<br />The moods range from energetic to bluesy to soft ballads to wistful. C&eacute;line is in top form. Instead of singing in a register only dogs can hear (&agrave; la Mariah Carey), her voice is softer and breathier on this album, especially on &quot;S'il suffisait d'aimer.&quot; More often than not her voice is a soft croon instead of belting notes out like she tends to do on her English albums. This is one of my favourite francophone albums in recent years. Pick up a copy and hear for yourself! This is a perfect gift for that C&eacute;line fan on your list, a good introduction to her works in French.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Shockingly excellent. Many people have put this film down, because they are comparing it with Silence of the Lambs. Yes, they are both brilliant movies but are completly different. You have got to see.
B00005NVHY|5.0|I own everything on CLINT EASTWOOD!
0618001905|5.0|My usual reading is fiction, but after reading Kingsolver's &quot;Poisonwood Bible&quot;, I had to know more about what happened in the Congo.  &quot;King Leopold's Ghost&quot; is one of the most important books I've read in the last ten years.  There are times when you have to put the book down and digest the horror of what you've just read - and find yourself saying &quot;How could I not know about this?  How could our history teachers NOT tell us of atrocities of this magnitude?&quot;  For any of you who read &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; in high school, and had your teachers present it to you as a parable about man's capacity for evil: know that what Conrad wrote in that book was no parable.  He was in King Leopold's Congo.  And he wrote what he saw.  &quot;King Leopold's Ghost&quot; is a book to enlighten and enrage - and to give to a close friend so that you have someone you can discuss it with.
B00005OWEG|5.0|REVISED REVIEW FOR BLU-RAY \\"Full Disclosure Edition\\" on Blu-ray)<br /><br />\\"Apocalypse Now almost described what happened to Francis Ford Coppola himself with this film. Originally Copppola was just going to produce and George Lucas was going to direct but Coppola eventually found himself in the director's chair in the Phillipines and with millions of dollars of sets destroyed by bad weather. Coppola found himself on a journey to the heart of darkness as production continued endlessly, Coppola continued to rewrite and reshoot footage, Martin Sheen had a heart attack and Coppola had what can best be described as a nervous break down.<br /><br />This new deluxe Blu-ray edition has been prepared from a new high definition transfer that has been color corrected and is presented in the correct aspect ratio for the first time. The new transfer looks quite good for the original version of the film (my preferred version)and \\"Redux\\" Coppola's rethink of the original film (which has some worthwhile moments and is interesting as an alternate take of the original vision but can't possibly replace the original flawed masterpiece).<br /><br />This edition also includes Eleanor Coppola's documentation of the insanity that surrounded the making of this film; \\"Heart of Darkness\\" is a marvelous documentary and receives its first HD transfer. Keep in mind that it was originally shot in 16mm so while it doesn't quite have the sharper look of the original film (or \\"Redux\\"), it has never looked better on home video.<br /><br />We get a huge amount of extras including the following new material--Francis Ford Coppola interviewing Martin Sheen (which is quite interesting given their shared experience and recollection of the insanity of the shoot); Coppola with screenwriter John Milius (Coppola recognizes Milius' important contribution to the script since HE wrote the original drafts that Coppola ended up working with as director); Orson Welles (who originally was going to direct a film version of \\"Heart of Darkness\\" for RKO before settling on \\"Citizen Kane\\")in a radio production of Joseph Conrad's novel; the entire interview of Coppola by Roger Ebert.<br /><br />Carried over from the previous edition are Coppola's audio commentary as well as both versions of the film (that way you can watch which version you want--although be advised this has the ORIGINAL 70mm theatrical ending which fades out WITHOUT the footage of the destruction of Kurtz's compound--that was added later to the 35mm print when it went into wide release although that footage IS included as with the previous edition as an extra). The bulk of the original special features are carried over to this edition as well. Due to time constraints I haven't had time to dig into all the other extras that were carried over from the previous edition although it appears on the surface to be exactly the same as the previous edition from Paramount Home Video.<br /><br />\\"Hearts of Darkness\\" includes a commentary track by Coppola and his wife Eleanor and on that same disc we also get excerpts from Millius'original script with Coppola's notes, storyboard gallery as well as marketing archive. I haven't had a chance to do more than peak at \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" (although I did have the previous edition which also had the commentary track on DVD)and haven't had a chance to really look at the extras on this disc so I can't provide any info on them beyond citing that they are here.<br /><br />We also get a lovely 48 page soft cover book with behind-the-scenes photos, an excerpt of the guide given to the production personnel on their arrival on location pointing out restaurants, etc. and a copy of the pages from Coppola's edition of Joseph Conrad's novel that Coppola kept with him for inspiration and notes.<br /><br />\\"Apocalpyse Now\\" would be Coppola's truly last great film (although he would make some exceptional ones in its wake)and proved to almost be his own personal apocalpyse where the director began toquestion the wisdom of making the film in the first place. While it isn't a flawless classic (what is?), even it's flaws in the original version are made up for by the ambition and vision Coppola delivers. In the case of \\"Redux\\" it's an interesting variation on the original but can't quite compete and comes across almost as an after thought--an interesting one--but one that doesn't quite pay off as well as the original film did in 1979 and even today.question the wisdom of making the film in the first place.

6304698658|5.0|I appreciate all the National lampoon films; however, Christmas Vacation is in a class by itself.  I think it's Chevy Chase's best film (and I like Chevy Chase).  Like other veryu effective comedies, this one has hidden or subtle jokes that make it easy to watch over and over.  Apart from the big laughs that come at the expense of Clarke's brother in law, the tree falling into the neighbor's house and the black-out that results from Clarke's ambitious tree lighting set-up, I find the best moments when Clakrke loses his temper after discovering that his bonus has been revoked from the chain saw home improvements scene - would make Bob Vila proud - to the danny kaye exclamation.  The funniest, however, is when he re-arranges rudolph the reindeer after he can't get the lights on.  It's funny because it's very real.  how many of us - even as children - have gotten angry at inanimate objects for our mistakes?  remeber being frustrated at a mecano set or the lego piece that just would not fit?<br />Unfortunately, nothing has surpassed this christmas comedy, and I can only think of one funnier movie: Dumb and Dumber.
6304698658|5.0|Every Christmas season we watch this classic comedy at least twice, generally more.  One laugh after another, sure to put you in the Holiday spirit.  This wonderful film will hopefully make this years Christmas Vacation a happy one for you and your family! Enjoy.
B00004U1F8|5.0|How can someone not like these two great movies?  &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Ghostbusters 2&quot; are two of the most entertaining movies you could find, in my opinion.  They include an All-Star cast: Dan Akroyd, Rick Moranis, Bill Murray, Annie Potts, Harold Ramis, Sigourney Weaver, and a host of great side-characters.  You also have the gigantic Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and Lord Vigo in &quot;Ghostbusters 2.&quot;  Oh, and we can't forget about Slimer!<br />What makes these movies click is the fact that they can balance humor and horror at the same time.  Bill Murray got all the best lines in both movies, and even when he's been slimed by a ghost or frozen solid by Lord Vigo's control, he still has the willpower to crack a great line.  A personal favorite of mine is when Murray sticks his fingers in the &quot;hip toaster&quot; and then pretends the thing is trying to eat his fingers off.  I just about roll off my couch every time over that one.<br />Another thing I like about these movies is that all the characters from the first movie were also in the second movie.  You sometimes see in movies how characters change from movie to movie, but everyone assumes their roles in both movies, and that is well appreciated.  I was glad that someone didn't replace Ernie Hudson in his role, for example, since his character was never really fleshed out in the first film and could have easily been expendable.  It was nice to see Akroyd and Ramis, the writers of both films, give him some more meat and potatoes in the second film.<br />Any fans of Peter MacNicol's character from the TV show &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; will like the quirky character he portrays in &quot;Ghostbusters 2.&quot;  He plays the part of thick-accented Janosz Poha, a Carpathian art-restorer who supervises things at a museum and is always pining for Weaver's affection.  He is equal parts goofy and creepy, especially the latter when is taken control of by Lord Vigo.  Every time I see his eyes beam up like flashlights in that red hallway, it sends chills down my spine.<br />In short, if you are looking for two movies that are equal parts funny and scary, gives this two-volume set a try.  If not, may Slimer's spirit eat you out of house and home.ime I see his eyes beam up like flashlights in that red hallway, it sends chills down my spine.<br />In short, if you are looking for two movies that are equal parts funny and scary, gives this two-volume set a try.

0441172717|5.0|Everyone knows Dune is a science fiction classic, but I whole-heartedly recommend it to readers who normally shy away from the genre.  Dune is an incredible story that far trancends its genre and I hope anyone who's tempted to dismiss it as just sci-fi will pick it up and give it a try.
B00005QZWJ|4.0|The producers must have had some confidence in this music to release it weeks before the movie appears, given the certainty that lots of people would listen to it pretty critically.  Their confidence seems justified; one doesn't have to make allowances all the way through, on the score of this being &quot;just soundtrack music.&quot;<br />I hope many of the thousands of people who'll buy this for the movie's sake, or Tolkien's, or Enya's, will go on to try some of the composers who have, I suspect, influenced Howard Shore &amp; Company.  There are some nice passages a la Sibelius and John Tavener, it seems to me.  But let's give credit for the overall feel, which has a nice British classical quality much of the time.  Try Bantock's Celtic Symphony, y'all, and some Ralph Vaughan Williams (maybe the Tallis Fantasia and Symphonies 5 &amp; 7).
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee has written one of the most effective, entertaining and powerful novels in the last 60 years with \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\".  The novel about the south that takes place during the depression. Lee takes an unusual yet stirring view, and that is thru the eyes of a young girl named Scout.  A brief synopsis of the main theme is that Scout's father is Atticus Finch a lawyer in a small town in Alabama that has to defend a negro accused of raping a white woman.  Whether the man did rape the woman is not the point due to the fact that white Southern society of the 1930's... have already judged him guilty.<br />Atticus's arguments in the courtroom and his point of view is mesmorizing and the couragous stand he makes in defense of his client makes this a page turner.  Yet again it is thru the eyes of a child who is starting to discover that the world isn't as nice as she once thought.  The circumstances that happens to Scout in the novel are funny, sad, and one part is absolutely chilling.  The other plots in the novel are effective as well as the supporting character's.<br />I know that others have written... reviews on this novel and its theme of racial injustice.  ...[M]y point of the review is to let readers know that this is an effective novel for young adults to read and discover a part of society that had extreme prejudice and another part of society that endured thru tremendous loss and hardship.  This is quite a novel and is highly recommended to all young readers.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Unfortunately I believe this movie tried to cash in on the success of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.  Unfortunately it failed.  As in SPR, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; used actual events but the story line did not concentrate on the events before and after the attack.  Rather it chose a weak love story theme that ruined the film.  Yes the attack scene was dramatic with some artistic license taken but it was still good.  <br />I think that this tried to be a cross of &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; and &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot;.  My advice would be to get these if you want a love story and a war story.<br />Watch &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and take it for what it is, a movie, and not a pseudo-historical account.
B00005JKOV|5.0|Waking Life is about people talking. It's also about the difference between life and death, realities and dreams. Some will find it boring because people just sit around and talk. And I can sympathize with these viewers. Don't expect great oratory, or deep philosophy. It's just different people going off at the mouth.<br />But if you can get beyond that, the film has a lot going for it. Of course, there is the animation of the film, which has gotten the rave reviews. But what works for me is how there is a very small, but very suggestive plot poking its head out of all the dialogues. I won't give it all away, but suffice it to say that all the talk about dreams and reality is really about the situation of the protagonist: is he dreaming? is he awake? What is happening to him?<br />The films is slow, but I like that. It helps communicate the tension he feels as the movies rolls along. Dreams are not easily controlled and the film conveys that perfectly.<br />I also like some of the dialogues and the gentle feel of the movie in general. You get situationist quotes, angry hate speech and snippets of Garcia Lorca. The movies is like a buffet of neat talk wrapped in innovative animation. Add the suggestive ending of the movie, and you get a winner.
B00005OM4N|4.0|CD REVIEW:<br />The CD contains 12 tracks (...). Some of the songs on the CD are not bad. I like tracks numbers 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11.<br />The CD is an enhanced CD, which means if you put the CD into your CD-Rom drive, there is a video you can play. The video shows a footage of Britney singing \\"Overprotected\\"; in this video, you can see clips from her first career movie.<br />What I don't like about the CD is that there are no lyrics to the songs. Her first CD, \\"...Baby One More Time\\", had lyrics (I don't know about the second one, \\"OOPS!.. I Did it Again\\", because I never bought it) but not this CD. There is a pull-out poster included, but it's small--not too small, but still small.<br />Overall, the CD is a great improvement from her debut CD.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead's new album Amnesiac sounds like their previous release Kid A doused in rubbing alcohol.  The album is more sterile, but the remaining flames only gain in intensity.  Songs such as \\"Packt [sic] like Sardines in a Crushd [sic] Tin Box,\\" \\"Pulk/Pull Rotating Doors,\\" and \\"Spinning Like Plates\\" all embrace the techno ground Radiohead captured with Kid A with a cleaner more intense approach.  Other tracks such as \\"Knives Out\\" and \\"Dollars &amp; Cents\\" abandon the electronic genre in search of the band's more traditional analog roots.<BR> Amnesiac opens with \\"Packt like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box,\\" a song blending ambient tribal rhythms with modern electronic ones.  As \\"Sardines\\" continues, it builds up in musical thickness, only to return to the bare bones of the song in the following verse.  Overall the song stands on its catchy grooves yet comes across as somewhat choppy due to the intensive build-ups and break-downs.  \\"Sardines\\" sets the tone for the rest of Amnesiac by straddling the fence between the electronic genre and the band's more traditional stylings.<BR> The analog Radiohead makes its presence known with the following track \\"Pyramid Song,\\" a swirling piano composition haunted by frontman Thom Yorke's swelling vocals.  The soothing quality that surrounds the song grows and grows, building itself up as the tune progresses, until it quickly subsides with a a heavy feeling of closure.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I believe that this movie is up to Titanic's standards. Although you will hear a lot of negative feedback about the movie watch it with a romantic heart and definetly a box of Kleenexs and you will enjoy this epic tale of Romance and Sadness about love being lost.
B00005N9CV|2.0|The magic from the previous records are gone... replaced by a big set of strings. Diana Krall still has a great a voice, but she sounds like one of many pretty-but-boring singers, drowned in a boring, predictable sound. There's not much trace of jazz here, which was made her previous records good - it's just a predictable, slightly pompous record. Go buy &quot;Love Scenes&quot; or &quot;Stepping Out&quot; instead - they're brilliant, and showcase what Diana Krall is good for.
B00003CX5A|4.0|&quot;I made this movie for 12-year olds, because these are the kinds of movies I used to love when I was twelve,&quot; says Director Tim Burton.<br />To get started- this film took me in a completely different direction than I'd assumed I'd be going.  Then it struck me; this is Tim Burton!  He's as unique and stylish as directors get.  Along the film, I noticed the color was off as if the movie were black and white, but having shades of color.  It wasn't my TV.  He sets the tone for a darkened classic-feeling mystery thriller.  Alfred Hitchcock (if he were still alive) would be amazed.  A director who seems so opposite in filmmaking is Steven Spielberg.  Spielberg wants to build suspense before jumping into the big bagje- like in JAWS or E.T.  He builds up our excitment to see the big effect.  Tim Burton on the other hand- is genius.  He doesn't want his audience saying &quot;Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's get going!&quot;  He jumps right on the wagon with the Headless Horseman.  Heads start rolling immediately.  It's just his style.  In BATMAN, he opened the movie with Batman taking out the trash immediately.  Take Spielberg and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  He took ten through fifteen minutes of elderly Ryan sitting at Hanks' gravestone and staring at the flag before we got to the war.  Burton wants you to get a slice of dessert before you get the meal deal.  It's interesting when you look at similar directors who start off with the big boom and get the audiences' blood running instead of dragging out this whole process of building their anticipation.  (George Lucas &quot;Star Wars&quot;, James Cameron &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, &quot;True Lies&quot;)<br />At one point in the opening scene of SLEEPY HOLLOW, I questioned whether Barry Soneifeld and Burton collided for a similar sequence in the beginning of both their '99 films (Barry's being WILD WILD WEST).  Two old guys going along their way, and all of a sudden they're running for their lives, but the blade ends up catchingup with them and off goes the head.  Though the films are entirely different in story and genre, it is interesting how similar their opening scenes are.  (Except it is a flying disk in WILD WILD WEST that cuts the man's head off)<br />Johnny Depp plays an interesting murder investigator for the recent kills in Sleepy Hollow.  His name is Ichabod Crane, a man who's determined to piece together the logical pieces of the everyday crime saga that lurks his world of work.  To him, it's just like figuring out how to break a pencil.  Yet, he soon learns that these head choppings are done by a force more evil than a psycho.  He may have come from hell.  He may just be the Headless Horseman.  Crane teams with a young boy in hope of solving the crime before the final target of the Horseman is taken out.<br />Christopher Walken, Christina Ricci and Casper Van Dien co-star.  Francis Ford Coppola also produces the film.<br />What is so fun about this movie is that is carries every aspect of film you need.  Whether in the movie you want good visuals, frightening sequences, interesting plot, strong performances, excellent art direction, comedy, action, suspense, drama, horror, and mystery- you have it one way or another.  When painting a picture that's going to stand out among other bright colored pieces- you'd probably want to use all the colors you can.  SLEEPY HOLLOW does it all.<br />This &quot;astonishing film&quot; is fun and freakily mysterious.  It is toned specifically for a unique ride.  Tim Burton is a master of originality.  Everything works in the film.  Though Tim Burton wanted 12-year olds to enjoy this movie, I doubt that this &quot;R&quot; rated movie will reach too many adolescent eyes, while instead it will be rocking the worlds of every other viewer watching it.  Take my word for it: &quot;everything is on a roll for this film&quot;.  SLEEPY HOLLOW is definetely the perfect film for a fun night.

B000059XXZ|5.0|The transformation of comic book superheroes into film or television properties is always a risky process. It's especially risky when dealing with a character as iconic and as beloved as Batman, the caped crimefighter of Gotham City. But with visionary director Tim Burton at the helm and versatile Michael Keaton in the title role, this &quot;Batman&quot; is a rousing success.<br />All the elements really come together in this memorable film. Keaton's brooding but likeable take on the Dark Knight is well complemented by Jack Nicholson's menacingly manic performance as the Joker. A fine supporting cast also strikes a good balance between fun and seriousness. The costuming and production design are astounding; Gotham City itself emerges as one of the most compelling &quot;characters&quot; in the film. And Danny Elfman's superb orchestral score perfectly complements the other elements of the film; Elfman's work here is a high point in a truly remarkable musical career.<br />There are a number of truly inventive sequences in the film, and as a whole it's a fine blend of action, drama, and mythic flourishes. Sadly, the three immediate sequels to this &quot;Batman&quot; have, in my opinion, demonstrated a gradual decrease in quality (with &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; being a truly atrocious piece of work). But Burton's first &quot;Batman&quot; is a treasure.
B000002UJQ|5.0|With &quot;Pablo Honey,&quot; Radiohead showed they could turn out some outstanding songs.  The entire album includes great songs of angry youth, ranging from &quot;Stop Whispering&quot; to the classic (if not overplayed) &quot;Creep.&quot;  Then &quot;The Bends&quot; showed how Radiohead could turn out a great album and explore a new sound. Most of the songs on that album sound nothing like the prior album. Then, comes this outing, &quot;OK Computer,&quot; which combined all those factors that made their first two albums memorable, but without becoming as experimental as their next two albums, which don't always make for an easy listen due to their nature. But &quot;OK Computer&quot; is to Radiohead what &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; was for U2, what &quot;Songs for Swingin' Lovers&quot; was for Frank Sinatra. All the facets that define the artist are on display.  Perhaps my favorite track is &quot;No Surprises,&quot; with its see-sawing base that makes this sound almost as though it's sung in a playground, but full of the determination to stop just standing around and griping about things.  This album is fully deserving of all the critical acclaim it received when it first came out.
B00003CXRP|5.0|There are a handful of visionary directors out there that are worth seeing every film (good or bad) that they are involved with. For me, those directors are Spike Lee, David Fincher, Oliver Stone, Spike Jonze, Steven Spielberg, the Coen Brothers, James Cameron, Stephen Soderbergh, and Robert Zemeckis. Whether the film succeeds or not is not what's important to me. What's important to me is feeling like the (money) I paid actually made me feel like I escaped for 2-3 hours from my monotonous daily routine.<br />Robert Zemeckis is one of those few directors that succeeds in this time and time again. From the brilliance of \\"Contact,\\" to the fun of the \\"Back To The Future\\" franchise, to the warmth of \\"Forrest Gump,\\" Mr. Zemeckis has always had a way of telling a story that makes you think differently afterwards about your own.<br />Without giving away any of the plot points in \\"Cast Away,\\" he has managed to do so again. I guarantee when you leave the theater, (whether or not you enjoyed the film as much as I did or not) you will hug your wife a little longer that evening. You'll show your love just a little more than you normally do towards those that are most precious in your life.
0440219078|5.0|It would be superfluous of me to write yet another suportive review for this book, which has quite a few already.So I'll keep this short...<BR>This book displays the necessity for individuality in a society and is overall a beautiful book. I read it when I was 15 also, and it still had a tremendous effect on me!(Reminiscent of 'Anthem') There is no age limit on this upstanding story! I highly recommend this to anyone who has yet to read it!
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|I kept waiting. Waiting to laugh. After all, this was supposed to be slapstick. Comedy, right? The only reason that I didn't walk out is because I kept hearing how funny it was. I kept waiting. The laugh never came. My sister and I looked at each other and shook our heads when the credits started rolling. <br />Was it the worst movie I've ever seen? Possibly. Definitely one of the most disappointing. <br />And don't you dare say I don't have a sense of humor. I loved the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; series, the &quot;Airplane!&quot; films, &quot;Top Secret.&quot; I'm a big fan of Mike Judge (Beavis &amp; Butt-Head, King Of The Hill, Office Space), and of Comedy Central's South Park series. Take a good look at my DVD List (my &quot;home page&quot; link.) You'll find plenty of comedies there that I'd recommend seeing, and then seeing again and again before renting &quot;Scary Movie.&quot; <br />Simply said, &quot;Scary Movie&quot; was awful. <br />Who would enjoy it? Hmm. I don't think I want to know. Seems hypocritical of me to bash someone who might like this film, when I enjoy watching &quot;Jackass&quot; on MTV. I just felt like the writers (that's an insult to writers everywhere) of &quot;Scary Movie&quot; must've gone to a 4th grade class during their recess, got some ideas from them, and then decided to let them write the movie over the next 4 years...
B00005RFAI|5.0|I was very scared to listen to this, afraid that it would be no good...Though I'd read many good reviews before its release had come out. I didn't care much for &quot;Can't Take me Home&quot; the songs didn't seem that good to me, it did start to grow on me a little, but this CD stuck with me immediately. I always look for genuine music, and that's exactly what I found here.<br /> Sure she sang ernestly on her last release, but this one she sings with pure,raw emotion. Something most singers hide from. The songs here are a far cry of the smooth R&amp;B of &quot;Can't Take me Home&quot; so if you loved that album you may not like this one, and if you hated it you'll prolly like this or vice versa. Anyways... Because this album has a variety of sounds tons of rock,some blues,rap,jazz,and pop. A great combination here!!!<br /> The songs are exceptional, paring up with Linda Perry was a great move, it created a disc full of songs with honest emotion,beautiful melodies,great great and honest lyrics,and wonderfull instrumentation. Now not all the songs on here are wonderfully, the farther you get into the album the better it is, which in my opinion is the way it should be!!! There may not be any definete hits here besides &quot;Get this Party stearted&quot;, but honestly I don't care and it doesn't matter. Because the songs are great either way. Because alot of the best artist have no hits at all, so that's that.<br /> So as a whole this cd rocks. The album kicks off with Missundaztood, good, but it doesn't hook me. Its upbeat and not much instrumentation it comes for an interesting peice. <BR>&quot;Don't Let me Get me&quot; is pretty much alon the same lines only more instrumentation and a stronger melody, a little stronger then the last track and has more of a hook. With straight-forward lyrics.<BR>Track three &quot;Just like a Pill&quot; is about doing drugs, but not like &quot;ITS GOOD FUN GETTING HIGH!!!&quot; More like the pain of it. Its a nice good rocky song. <BR>&quot;Get this party Started&quot; is a song you've mostly heard if you listen to top 40 radio, it has a great dance beet and more fun lyrics then the rest of the album also with powerfull vocals.<BR>&quot;Respect&quot; track five, is the rap song. Its nothing like Aretha Franklins song, its a totally different song. Its very interesting at the beginning it reminds me of an Eminem song, but quickly get's away from that. Its a rappish song, very interesting, but not as strong as the other tracks.<BR>&quot;18 Wheeler&quot; this is a good song, a nice Alanisish song, with the sassy lyrics we love from P!nk!!! It makes me think of Nelly Furtado as well(Just because of Hey Man though!!!lol)... But its a pretty good song overall!!!<br />Track 7 is a very good song with a sad melody, very emotional vocals,and lyrics about domestic violence. It hits me hard at home, I've know situations like this... Its a really good song one of the best here.<BR>Track 8- Misery is a duet Steven Tyler, very interesting I must say. Its alot like 40's lounge music, not swing or jazz, lounge music(Think Madonna singing on Dick Tracey and Roger rabbit's wife. in &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; singing!!!hehe seriously though!!!)But it is really good. It has great vocals from P!nk and Steven Tyler, and is one of the few songs on here about love. The melody is so sweet like sugar I *Love* it!!! Its very beautiful.<BR>Track 9 Dear Diary, its nothing like Britney Spears, no the melody is sweet and the lyrics are much smarter. I read a review(a professional one)saying that it wsn't as good as Britney Spears one, but in my opinion her's stunk(I love Britney's music, but that song was lame and trite). Pink's is much,much better, that reviewer was hard of hearing I guess....<br />Track 10- Eventually is slowed down alot, its the only other love song here besides Misery, but its good as well. It has smart lyrics and a smooth melody. Just another beautiful song!!!<BR>Track 11 this duet with Linda Perry is in two words, REALLY GOOD!!! I love it, it has such a beautifull melody, great lyrics and some nice vocals by P!nk and Perry. The bridge is a little so-so, but that's only a few seconds!!! Besides that all in all a sweeping song!!!<BR>Track 12- NUMB brings the tempo back up and jumps back to rock!!! Its not one of the better songs, but still pretty good. It reminds me of Garbage, its a song about verbal abuse.<BR>Track 13- &quot;Goin to California&quot; This song is very, very slow at first, but picks up a little bit... Its still good though, the lyrics are good and the distant voice this is a nice effect. And a nice melody, and topped off with very emotional vocals by Pink.<br />Track 14- &quot;My Vietnam&quot; an interesting song this is, a nice close for the album, it makes you think esp. with lyrics like &quot;Life keeps dropping bombs, and I'm keeping score.&quot; and one of the most intrueging and interesting things here is the fact that torwards the end of the song it includes part of the spangeled banner as played by Jimmy Hendrix when he was at Woodstock in '69... I *Love* it, that part alone makes the song cool!!!hehe Naw but overall its a good song!!!<br /> So the great thing about this album is the emotional honesty and wonderfully smart,straightforward, and clever lyrics. The lyrics never fail here. And the melodies on the majority of the songs are very strong. And if you don't enjoy this album and come back for more, I pitty you!!! But not everyone likes everything!!! Just come in with an open mind, and don't expect a whole album like &quot;Get this Party Started&quot; or another &quot;Can't take me home&quot;....
B00003CXN4|5.0|I saw this movie because I'm a longtime admirer of Steven Soderbergh's work. He's probably most well known for his directing &quot;Erin Brockovich,&quot; &quot;Sex Lies &amp; Videotape,&quot; and &quot;Out Of Sight.&quot; Michael Douglas recent work in &quot;The Game,&quot; and &quot;The Wonder Boys&quot; (for which he should be nominated for an Oscar) is the other reason I wanted to see this movie. (&quot;Traffic&quot; has been on my DVD want list for about a year now - ever since Soderbergh was rumored for involvement.)<br />I remember reading in Premiere magazine about the struggle that this film went through finding a director, and then how the stars all wanted to be in it because of him. It's a rollercoaster of a film, full of intensity, and then quickly followed by moments where the crowd in the theater will laugh, or clap when the something happens. There aren't many moments where that happens in movies anymore.<br />&quot;Boogie Nights&quot; co-stars Luis Guzmán (who also played &quot;Chino&quot; in &quot;Out Of Sight&quot;) and Don Cheadle (who also played &quot;Snoopy&quot; in &quot;Out Of Sight&quot;) are once again important to the greatness of this film. Their characters provide much of the humor to the film, but not taking away from it's realistic intensity. That's not done very well in movies anymore, but they both do it perfectly here.<br />An incredible cast, without a throwaway moment in the movie. Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Benecio Del Toro, Steven Bauer, Amy Irving, Benjamin Bratt, Salma Hayak, and Erika Christensen all have very important roles, and Soderbergh blends them in, making us care about the good and bad guys.<br />While hanging around after the film was over watching the credits and talking to the people around me who enjoyed the film as much as I did, I noticed that Flea &amp; Herbie Hancock helped to score the film, which should also be nominated for best score.<br />Stephen Gaghan wrote &quot;Traffic,&quot; who has also wrote for &quot;NYPD Blue,&quot; and &quot;The Practice&quot; - two shows known for their intensity and realism. He does a great job of combining several stories into one (As good as they've been done most recently in &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; &quot;Boogie Nights,&quot; and &quot;Magnolia.&quot;)

B00003CXTG|2.0|This movie is long, cliched, and boring. Since the other reviews covered everything else, I will focus on my pet peeve: the final moments of the attack sequence.<br />Now, in the -ACTUAL- attack, two American fighters -did- manage to get off the ground...but they were outnumbered and outgunned...and lasted all of 5 minutes.<br />Michael Bay dispenses with historical accuracy here in favor for some Top Gun-like sequences to appease the audience after subjecting them to 25 minutes of US people and property getting helplessly blown to bits. Of course, the &quot;Maverick&quot; and &quot;Ice Man&quot; of this film end up being Affleck and Hartnett's characters, as the pair make their better-trained enemies look like this was their first flight in an aircraft. The fact that the Zero was more maneuverable than the P-40 was causally overlooked here as well.<br />I felt this movie was rather disrespectful toward those who died in the attack, merely because it seems to throw the attack on the backburner in favor of the trite love triangle.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Based on the first novel by Stephen King (The Green Mile, Stand by Me, Cujo). The story is about an young strange girl named Carrie White (Sissy Spacek in a Strong Oscar Nominated Performance) has to deal with her mother (Piper Laurie in a Terrific Oscar Nominated Performance), who believes in the puritan beliefs of God and the Students (Nancy Allen, John Travolta, P.J. Soles and anothers) who ridicule her. Then Carrie discover she has the power of Telekinetic abilties. Carrie used her abilities for revenge at her class mates.<br />This film is the ulimate revenge tale for anyone who was rejected & ridicule. Directed by Brain De Palma (Blow Out, Dressed to Kill, Rasing Cain) images of the film has dated a bit. Fine screenplay by Lawrence D. Cohen (Stephen King`s It). This was a Box Office Hit in Theaters and it`s become a Modern Day Horror Classic for the Genre. Followed by a In-Name Sequel with Amy Irving in a Supporting Role and a T.V. Remake. Grade:A.
B00003CXRM|5.0|And it isn't just the M. When I heard this was based on the Oddysey, I snorted. However, having seen it, I say it is the best religious cinema since Pulp Fiction. The characters were done so well, I think all three leads deserve Best Actor. The music and scenery were haunting and beautiful, but believable. And who ever suspected that George Clooney and Chuck Berry were separated at birth? If you don't have to change your underwear after the big political rally scene at the end, you need to sleep in a coffin.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|\\"Shrek\\" is the ultimate fractured fairy tale, a film that manages to simultaneously honor and lampoon the conventions of its genre without becoming smug or condescending in the process.  For while it is sardonic, \\"Shrek\\" is never cynical, so confident and assured are its makers in establishing and maintaining just the right tone for a revisionist exercise such as this one.  The film certainly conveys a modern sensibility, yet it is a gentle sort of iconoclasm that allows us to enjoy the more conventional aspects of the story (the happily-ever-after ending, for example) even as we are laughing at the obvious absurdities contained within them.<br />The revisionism begins with Shrek himself, as unromantic a figure as has ever earned the title of \\"hero\\" in a fairy tale adventure.  For Shrek is an ogre, plain and simple, an ugly, cranky, decidedly standoffish beast who wants nothing more than to rid his swamp of all the classic fairy tale figures (Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, The Three Bears, The Three Blind Mice et al), who have been consigned there by the dastardly Lord Farquaad, who is attempting to purge his land of all those bothersome folkloric personalities.  To earn the deed to his land and thereby have authority to evict the squatters, Shrek agrees to go in search of the beautiful Princess Fiona, rescue her from her dragon-guarded castle, and bring her back for Lord Farquaad to marry (thereby earning the latter the legitimate title of Prince of the Land).  Of course, every valiant hero needs his own wisecracking sidekick to accompany him on his journey and Shrek finds his in Donkey, a companion whose sardonic humor serves as both a thorn in the side and as a source of moral inspiration for the unlikely, often socially backward hero.<br />It is hard to overestimate the seemingly boundless originality, ingenuity and creativity that have gone into the making of \\"Shrek.\\"  Here is a film that can truly be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.  Children will revel in the glorious animation and the assorted lowbrow comic antics of Shrek, Donkey and even Princess Fiona, while more seasoned adults will delight in the sly in-jokes, bawdy innuendoes and clever anachronisms that pour forth in amazing abundance from the mouths of the characters.  There is never a dull moment, since the writers, William Steig and Ted Elliott, and the directors, Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, always seem to have new and clever tricks up their sleeves.  Donkey, in particular, is the most amusing and endearing sidekick since the Robin Williams genie in \\"Aladdin.\\"<br />The script pokes marvelous fun not only at the whole fairy tale mentality, but also at the romanticized conventions of medieval life.  There are jousting knights, damsels in distress and an Inquisition-like rounding up of all those caught demonstrating any proclivity for the supernatural and the magical.  So much seems to be happening throughout the course of the film that a second viewing is surely in order, just so one can catch all those delicious details that might have slipped by on the first go-round.  (The gingerbread man interrogation scene is particularly hilarious).<br />Despite its tone of sardonic playfulness, \\"Shrek\\" is, happily, not afraid to indulge in a bit of heartwarming sentimentality at times.  The romantic feelings that develop between the Princess and the Ogre are genuine and heartfelt, made palatable by all the flippancy going on around them.  In fact, Princess Fiona is very much a modern heroine, shrewd, matter-of-fact and able to roughhouse with the best of the boys this strange land has to offer.<br />Special note must be made of the superb voice work, which is largely responsible for bringing these extraordinarily well-delineated animated characters to life on the screen.  Mike Myers (Shrek), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad) and, especially, the brilliant Eddie Murphy (Donkey) all turn in bell ringer performances.<br />In every area of the filmmaking process, \\"Shrek\\" excels like no general audience film since \\"Toy Story 2.\\"  Like that earlier work, \\"Shrek\\" provides audiences of all ages and all types with the joy that comes from seeing a superb idea superbly executed.  \\"Shrek\\" is an intelligent, witty and imaginative family film.  Be sure to catch it.  Films like this don't come along very often.a of the filmmaking process, \\"Shrek\\" excels like no general audience film since \\"Toy Story 2.\\"  Like that earlier work, \\"Shrek\\" provides audiences of all ages and all types with the joy that comes from seeing a superb idea superbly executed.  \\"Shrek\\" is an intelligent, witty and imaginative family film.

B00003CX5P|3.0|I have rated this DVD based upon what I would think of it IF I saw it.  I had high hopes that when Lucas put out the DVD, he would finally find somebody who could act and take him to the studio to dub his voice over Jake Lloyd's.  No such luck.  So, I won't be buying this DVD, because if I can't stand to watch the movie again -- and Lloyd makes it absolutely unbearable to watch -- there's no sense owning the DVD, special features or not. (And, yes, I used &quot;wither&quot; in my title because that is what I wished Lloyd had done in the Libyan desert.)

B000002PH1|5.0|Behold:  a second solo album and one that's even better than her debut, Belinda.  Where Belinda was a toe-dip in the ocean of pop, Heaven On Earth has Belinda Carlisle splashing and swimming happily with the best of them.  And the title track was asking to shoot to #1 on the Billboard charts, which it did.<br />&quot;Circle In The Sand&quot; is a perfect beach song, not in the vein of the boppity &quot;Bikini Beach&quot; but light-paced, ideal for walking along the beach, watching the waves.<br />Her cover of Cream's &quot;I Feel Free&quot; is the first time I heard this song and as such, is better than the original or the David Bowie rendition of it.  This is the same song that seems to be played in the book American Psycho, not the movie.<br />&quot;World Without You&quot; is a nice ballad whose styling reminds me a bit of John Waite's &quot;Missing You&quot;.  The same rhythm guitar and synthesizer styling permeates throughout the next song, &quot;I Get Weak&quot;, which is not a weak song by any means; she makes it credible, thanks to lyrics by ace songwriter Diane Warren.<br />The fun-tastic fast-paced &quot;Fool For Love&quot; has a simple and sweet chorus:  &quot;If I'm a fool for love (3x), I don't care (2x)&quot;<br />&quot;Nobody Owns Me&quot; has a strong pounding rock guitar dominant.  It also makes Belinda one of the few singers who has the license for singing &quot;oooh&quot; to finish a line AND make it sexy.  Susanna Hoffs is the only other one I can think of who also qualifies.<br />The sad and wistful &quot;Love Never Dies&quot; closes the album.<br />Rick Nowels produced this album, as well as Runaway Horses and Live Your Life Be Free, and no doubt his masterful skill contributed Belinda's well-deserved stardom.  Add to this are some talented guest singers and artists, including Charlotte Caffey, and two-thirds of what would later become Wilson Phillips, as well as Mellencamp drummer Kenny Aronoff.<br />Heaven On Earth lives up to its title and for me, this was one of the best reasons to be alive in 1987.  Every song here is singleworthy, and there are very very few albums to which I can say that to.r me, this was one of the best reasons to be alive in 1987.

B000002UDB|5.0|As I write this, it has been a little over twelve hours since I learned that George Harrison has embarked on that Magical Mystery Tour yonder, flown to Blue Jay Way, gone to that great Strawberry Field in the sky.  I am devastated.  Having two Beatles die during one's lifetime is something one should not have to endure.  Yet it has happened.  This review is thus dedicated to him.<br />&quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;, sung by our dear departed George is made psychedelic by vocal distortion, cello overdubs, and tapes played backwards.  &quot;Please don't be long, please don't you be very long, 'cause I may be asleep&quot; takes on a different meaning given the circumstances.<br />Bizarre Beatles songs always do me good, and &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot;, with its off-the-wall lyrics, random voices and choruses inserted, more weird sounds at the end, and a radio play of King Lear at the end, is no exception.  The strings in this song is also a nice touch.  Best example of bizarre lyric:  &quot;Semolina pilchard climbing up the Eiffel Tower/Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna/man you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allen Poe.&quot;  Makes quite an interesting visual.<br />Cellos are used also on &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot;, a wonderful Paul song.<br />The &quot;Hey-la, hey helloa&quot; chorus at the end of the song is a nice touch.<br />The double-sided single &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; are back to back here.  Why this got stalled at #2 on the British pop charts because of Engelbert Humperdink's &quot;Release Me&quot; I'll never understand.  The decision by John Lennon and George Martin to do the different versions on &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; was pure genius.  The first chorus has Version #1, the second chorus is from Version 2, and the final chorus is a blend of the two, creating a weird effect due to the fact that they were a semi-tone apart.  And yeah, that's &quot;nothing to get hung about&quot;.  And love that sweet Bach trumpet in the middle of &quot;Penny Lane&quot;!  Thank you Paul, for watching that concert on TV and asking George Martin if you could add it on the song!  That alone is worth the song, which is awash with classical instruments.<br />The brass blast of the first few notes of the Marseillaise commences the celebratory, romantic closing song of the album.  It's what 1967, the year of the Summer Of Love, was all about:  &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;.<br />Of the four Beatles, at least George did sincerely believe that &quot;love is all you need&quot; when asked by Derek Taylor in the Sgt Peppers 20th anniversary documentary.  He even quoted a passage from Sir Walter Scott's &quot;Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot;:  &quot;Love rules the court, the camp, the grove/And men below, and saints above/For love is heaven, and heaven is love.&quot;pet in the middle of &quot;Penny Lane&quot;!

6300208591|5.0|I first saw La Dolce Vita when it was released into American theatres back in the 60s. Until then, movies were just an easy escape for me, something to do on a Saturday afternoon. This first Fellini experience changed everything. Money-and-beauty-don't-buy-happiness is not a new idea. What is new--still--is how Fellini shapes our experience of the idea and of film as art. For contemporary audiences looking for eye candy, many spots in La Dolce Vita can feel like a bad home video. Every time I watch it, I ask why he left in this pointless shot, that futile business. Fellini answers, when I want you to feel good, I'll make Amarcord.
B00005214X|5.0|The 3rd album of All things must Pass was called &quot;Apple Jam&quot;, featuring George, Eric, Dave Mason etc -all of the guests invited to play. When you listen closely or LOUDLY, you will see why it stands as one of the finest syntheses of sheer, unadulterated, rock and roll at its purest core that anyone could ever find. And of course it was created by a former Beatle.  Check it out!

In the end this movie was horrible and too slow to even allow me to finish it. Enjoy!!

She holds true to who she is and has no shame, that's gotta deserve some level of respect.  Way to go Brit!
B00005QJDG|5.0|How to describe this TRIPLE LIVE CD album from BEST BAND in the UNIVERSE?? Words simply fail me. It is amazing, stuning, breathtaking :-) I've been lucky to see the guys playing live in Ljubljana, Slovenia. What a show! They also played entire SFaM, this CD just brings back emotions of concert. One point of concert which I will never forget was Jordans keyboard solo. I was simply amazed by it and thought I would never hear it again BUT here it is, on this CD, that same solo. I couldn't be happier :-) Selection of other songs is great especially on 3rd CD. Everything else has been said about this masterpiece. Not to own it is MORTAL SIN for any DT FAN :-)

630460291X|4.0|Robin of Locksley, imprisoned during the Crusades, returns home to find his father murdered, his family home destroyed, and his homeland in the grip of the ambitious and ruthless Sheriff of Nottingham. Teamed with Azeem the Moor, and a rough and tumble band of outcasts, Robin seeks to avenge his father and preserve the land for the return of King Richard. <br />Critics largely lambasted this film, but it's not bad, once you get past its flaws: Costner's non-existent accent; some historical and cultural inaccuracies; less than kind representations of  religious figures; and a certain disregard for both the original legend and the classic Errol Flynn film. One could quibble a bit about those things, but why? The producers of this film wanted to make a rough and rousing adventure, and they succeeded. Directed with verve and gusto by Kevin Reynolds, with solid supporting performances from many of Britain's finest (the always welcome Brian Blessed and Geraldine McEwan, for instance), the film overcomes its drawbacks with great action, a good sense of humor, and fun, old-fashioned romance. <br />The lead performances are all solid. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Marian is shrewd, tough, and vulnerable; a good heroine for the film, although her character becomes a bit too whiny during the climactic segments. Morgan Freeman is a real asset to the film, perfectly cast as Azeem, the Moor; he commands every scene he's in. There's also have a wild, wickedly funny performance by Alan Rickman as the Sheriff, who, when angered, demands that there be no more \\"merciful beheadings\\" and to \\"call off Christmas!\\" (Rumor has it that it was this performance that got him cast as Snape in the Harry Potter movie.) Costner's performance isn't going to win any awards, but he's good enough, giving the character of Robin both a certain cockiness and  winsome vulnerability. <br />There's humor to spare; some of the funniest moments come from Azeem's droll observations of English life and customs;at other times it's people's reactions to him. Reynolds isn't the world's greatest director, but he knows action, has a good sense of timing, and makes fine use of the scenic beauty of the English countryside. If--and this may be a big if for some--you can look past the film's flaws, it's a fun and entertaining two and a half hours.  One gripe about the DVD, though--why two sides for the film?
B000000Y27|5.0|He is kinda like me when he comes to guitar playing. He dosen't play with a pick, and he tries to make every note sound. It works. Very good combination of blues and jazz. Very good remastering too. Enjoy.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|I know it's a bit predictable to say that Rio is their best album. I would rather say that their debut was their best album as I prefer the whole New Romantic thing to the bands 1982 Miami Vice aesthetic they adopted with RIO. But white sport jackets and fedoras aside, Rio is so well constructed and produced that it blows any other album by them out of the water. <br />This is the fun Duran Duran we all fell in love with. <BR>The musicianship on this album is playful, and often superb (When are these guys gonna get the credit they deserve?). Many of the songs have wonderfully wierd basslines from John Taylor.  <br />Andy Taylor's guitar was in full effect, and proves that he was as important as the vocals of Simon Le Bon in giving them their unique sound.  <BR>&quot;Rio&quot; gives you hits aplenty. Not only do you get the title track, &quot;Hungry like the wolf&quot; and &quot;Save a prayer&quot; on this CD, you also get the outstanding &quot;The Chauffer&quot; which has to be one of their greatest moments on record.  &quot;Hold back the Rain&quot; showed that when they (sort of) wanted to rock out, they were damned good at it. &quot;New Religion&quot;  has a bass groove from hell and the odd effect of Lebon, as two alter egos, argueing for a chorus. <BR>The classic album cover was designed by Nagel and was later defaced and satired on the bands 1997 release &quot;Medazzeland&quot; which was probably their next best album after Rio. Hmmmm.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|Reasons to watch this movie:<BR>Amount of Action- Theres plenty of it. <BR>Game to Movie Transision- The movie version of Lara Croft closely resembles what I think of the game's Lara Croft<BR>Lara Croft(Angelina Jolie)- Cocky, nice moves, physically appealing.<BR>The Butler-You'll have to watch to check this guy out.<br />Reasons not to watch this movie:<BR>Laughable action- Sure, there's plenty of action, but whats the point of it when the weapons remind you of a game of laser tag.  The noise the machine guns make remind me of twittering birds in the morning.  Croft's weapons weren't so bad, but why do they have to be pistols?  I know that's her trademark, but she didn't have to use them the entire movie! Where's the uzies or M-16?  The troops, carrying machine guns, couldn't hit a thing!  Sure, Lara's supposed to be fast but she's not THAT fast.  There's no way she could move among them the way she did without getting hit unless these guys are idiots.  The hand to hand battles were short as well as lame.<BR>The Ending- Fairly predictable, as well as a little corny.<br />Is it worth watching?<BR>Sure. Go out one of these nights and rent it.  Though the action is pitiful, there is enough of it to make up for it.  Along with that, this movie shows in good detail what Lara Croft and her life would be like.  Just don't expect Matrix type action, and this will be an enjoyable movie.
B000002U8A|4.0|This album encapsulated Duran Duran's prime in the eighties. When the world premiere video of \\"The Reflex\\" came on MTV we all felt like we were apart of something really magnificent. The tour for this record in 1984 was their biggest ever, and it was also the last time the band would record an album with Roger and Andy Taylor.<br />Musically the album is worse then \\"Rio\\" or ther 1981 debut, but it had three big hits. \\"Union of The Snake\\" and \\"The Reflex\\" are pleasant enough pop songs . For older fans, we have the nostalgic value added to their inherent listenability as we recall their videos when we were teens.  \\"New Moon on Monday\\" is probably the best single off the album with it's grande chorus and odd noises what it's actually about I dont know, and the same is true of all of Mr. Lebons lyrics on this album. One minute he makes sense, and the next he is just full of (...).<br />There are lots of funny noises on the album actually, like on the intro to \\"The Seventh Stranger\\" which is a moody and mysterious sounding track, about unrequited love, I think. <br />I can live without \\"Cracks in the Pavement\\"  and \\"I Take the Dice.\\" They just take up space and aren't particularly relevant. <BR>\\"Tiger Tiger\\" should have been a B side, as it is both long and tedious. <BR>Buy this album for two reasons (other than nostalgia):<BR>\\"Of Crime and Passion\\" is a superb semi-rocker with outstanding (first verse) lyrics about being jilted by a lover and features nice keyboard work from Nick Rhodes.  \\"Shadows on your side\\" is another gem with hooks and great guitar licks. Those two are both the best non-single songs on here. They are also the only songs where Andy Taylor (on guitar) is not turned down in the mix!<br />The band obviously got too carried away with the \\"Goonies\\" movie and all things Steven Spielberg when they designed the cover and album jacket for this record. The tour guide was as ridiculous, as well as the Video for \\"union of the snake.\\"
0767802659|4.0|Starship Troopers is one of my favorite science fiction movies, simply because it has great special effects, great action, and witty humor in to a small 2 hour movie. <br />Let's start off with the good things: The special effects are magnificent. The spaceships and the bugs look better than special effects that are done today (in 2001) Also, the action is fast and furious. Probably the best scene in the movie is an all-out slugfest when a platoon of soldiers defend a base against thousands of bugs. The acting is almost there, with solid preformances by Michael Ironside and Casper Van Dien, but also with below average performances by airhead Jake Busey and Patrick Muldoon. <br />The only bad thing is the plot, which barely exists. But then again who cares? It's an action movie!<br />The DVD is only average, with a few deleted scenes, and a 6 minute documentary. Aside from that, Tristar threw in a bunch of boring screen tests and special effects breakdowns which, all in all, only take about 10 minutes or less to watch.<br />Anyway, Starship Troopers is entertaining, and the DVD will satisfy some peoples' tastes, but for people (like me) who want more special features, I'd wait till a better edition comes out. (trust me, Tristar will get to it sooner or later)
B00005OWIU|5.0|This is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. It might help if you play a musical instrument for you to really love it. But, this soundtrack may also encourage you to start to PLAY an instrument. It's classical stuff, of course. But there are a few tracks that sort of get you going, like the Chessmatch!<br />My soundtrack came with a special edition CD-ROM, and it's pretty cool, too! You can download screensavers, wallpaper, look at the Harry Potter trailers from ALL over the world, and even get previews of the EA Harry Potter Video Game and Harry Potter Lego Video Game. 5/5 on this one, too!
0393317552|5.0|Without any doubt I can say that 'Guns, Germs, and Steel' is one of the best science books of 20th century. Although it is not a history book in the narrow definition of the term History, 'Guns, Germs, and Steel' answers questions about the origins of human civilizations, which no historian has ever been able to answer. <BR>What makes this book unique is the fact that Mr. Diamond does not even bother to recount the histories of early human civilizations. Instead he focuses on the environment where those civilizations developed.<BR>In my opinion, the most remarkable thing about this book is that it demolishes the racist theories of history. It offers convincing explanation about why some societies happened to be more advanced than others.<BR>Guns, Germs, and Steel is a must for every one who is interested in History. It delivers a comprehensive overview of the evolution of human civilization, which no other book has been able to offer yet. Fascinating work!!
0141301155|5.0|A childhood favorite of mine, I recently re-read this Dahl classic with my wife.  We were whisked along through the thrill of Charlie obtaining one of the prized Golden Tickets and his tour through Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with his Grandpa.  It's a bit of a moralistic romp; what sets this volume apart from other children's works?<br />The dark, almost maleficent flippancy of Willy Wonka is brilliant--the person handing out the moralistic lessons is not some smarmy do-gooder.  The manic playfulness of Willy Wonka combined with the general tall-tale quality of this book create a wonderful escape from the dreary world we and Charlie typically inhabit.
B00000FCBC|5.0|For many years, Metallica's 1987 EP Garage Days Re-Revisited was the most sought-after item in their catalog; it was constantly bootlegged in the '90s, and often supplemented by a host of covers Metallica had released on singles and compilations throughout the years. By 1998, the band had understandably grown frustrated with this situation and decided to confront the problem head-on by reissuing all these rarities. Savvy businessmen that they are, they also realized they needed to give hardcore fans who already owned all the covers a reason to purchase the new set - hence, the expansion of the Garage Days EP to the double-disc blowout Garage Inc. The second disc's rarities are balanced by the first disc's new covers, the bulk of which were recorded following the Re-Load tour. It shouldn't come as a surprise that these covers recall the blooze'n'boogie heavy rock of the Loads, but what is a surprise is that Metallica seems to have found their footing in this style through other people's songs. Whether it's Bob Seger, Blue yster Cult, Thin Lizzy, Nick Cave, or the all-star jam on Lynyrd Skynyrd's &quot;Tuesday's Gone,&quot; the band effortlessly makes the songs seem like their own, through a bizarre mix of respect and ballsy irreverence. Sure, it may not be nearly as raw as early Metallica, but it is a better listen than either of the Load records. And if raw is what you want, the equally diverse disc two provides all the thrills you could hope for. At one time, it might have seemed a little odd that Metallica would cover Budgie, Diamond Head, the Misfits, and Queen, but if Garage Inc. proves anything, it's that the group's musical instincts, risks, and sense of humor have made them the greatest metal band of the '80s and '90s.
B000001DQI|5.0|I was about thirteen years old when I heard Bennie and the Jets for the first time. After that I heard Rocket Man and Daniel. Soon I was hooked into his music big time. I bought his greatest hits and loved it. Next along the way I heard Levon, Tiny Dancer, Harmony, Someone saved my life tonight, and many other wonderful singles. I'm now sixteen years old and I bought GYBR as a birthday present for my self. Each one of the songs are hits and special in their own ways. So far that was the smartest investment I spent twenty dollars on. (...) I absolutely love this album! In fact I listen to it more than I listen to any other music. I'm so glad that I bought it. My dad listen's to depressing blues, while my mom plays overly obnoxous eighties music, so when I played this seventeen track treasure in both of their houses, it took me on rapture of happiness. If anybody likes his greatest hits, then you will love this. The best part is that Elton wasn't gay at the time when this album was recorded. I feel sorry for other kids my age who listen to senseless rap and pop today. They don't know what they're missing!
B00005QK3W|4.0|Good songs, and a great band. The experimental nature of the recording is really endearing, and Paul's in fine voice.<br />What album are you guys listening to? Not this one.<br />4 stars.
B00000I0XW|5.0|This one is among my favourites.However,I didn't realize it when I first bought the album.I just wanted to get the collection of beautiful songs by Lloyd Webber and performed by a good singer. I didn't find anything unique in it then.<BR>I kept listening to it from time to time and also heard a lot by others.All of a sudden ,I discovered the beauty.Unlike Sarah's other albums(timeless,eden.etc),here is a hidden power.No special effects,but the voice is quite sentimental and enmotional,and yet,well-controlled.She did not soar heavenly,but she really touches my feelings with every word.Sometimes she reached an operatic range,but it is so natural that you could only feel the rich emotion that she conveyed to you. When you listen to this,it requires a quiet atmosphere. <BR>Sarah has a charm that includes both elegance and depth.With her voice well-trained,the version of the songs in the album is absolutely the best one.I particularly like &quot;tell me on a sunday&quot;and&quot;wishing you were somehow here again&quot;--for the grievous melody and the excellent portrait by the singer.Every song is worth listening wholeheartedly.<BR>There's nothing luxurious in the contents.There's a glory for the listeners to share.I just want more of this kind.

B00004RI87|5.0|This album rocks at full speed and it don't take (...) from no one.  Unida is fronted by John Garcia of Kyuss so i thought they would have a pretty similar sound.  Well, i was fooled - not a bad thing!  The fuzzy stoner sound is bassically non-existant on this album as is the trademark Kyuss supa-bass. What is here is firery blues-based hard rock.  The musicians are all competent and Garcia puts his heart into every line - he can really wail at times.  They only slow down for the last track, which is a lengthy jam with a few lyrics thrown in for good measure.  My favorite track is \\"If Only Two\\", but all the songs are really good.
6305499365|5.0|I haven't been in the work force for too long, but there's so much in this movie that i relate to.  The sick thing is that so many of the gags are so dead-on to reality; you don't know if you should laugh or cry.  If you work in an office (unfortunately) you will know all the characters in this movie.  My last boss definitely had a good dose of Lumberg in him.  All of the main characters are solidly funny, and it doesn't hurt to have Jennifer Aniston as the love interest.  There's a moderate amount of harsh language and a naked girl on a TV for about 2 seconds, but nothing gross or in exceptional bad taste.  Final Note: It might help to see &quot;Superman III&quot; before you watch.
B000059PPN|4.0|This film is excellent for atmosphere and gore.  Creepy moments coupled with outlandish gore scenes that rival those in the Beyond.  If unconventional b-horror films are your thing, then check out House By The Cemetery.  Well worth the wait for the definitive, uncut version of this film, whcich was banned in many countries until this recent release.
B00003CXDD|1.0|From the obvious rip-offs of Lord of the Rings, the Bible and lots of other standard quest fantasy (not to mention Star Wars), to the idiotic villains, to the lame special effects (including a ridiculous two-headed dragon named &quot;Ebersisk&quot;, obviously Lucas knew these guys weren't going to be fans of this drivel), this is a really awful film.  The script is terrible, the performances range from lame to embarassing, the whole thing reeks of a lack of imagination but a determination to make some kind of fantasy film cobbled together by people (or, I guess, a person) who really can be bothered to come up with anything new. If the Ewoks were the first sign that Lucas had lost his touch, ths was the second.  We should have seen the Phantom Menace and it's Jar Jar Binks sense of things coming a mile away.
B000005ILF|5.0|I'm at a loss regarding the last reviewer. Can't imagine whatever it is he's looking for in Sting (a message in a bottle?), if not this. Break out. Likewise I've listened to Sting from the very first.<br />The lyrics and composition here are exceptional, and besides which, surpass the classic pop gems i grew up with and enjoy with that nostalgia.  Unlike the latter, these are more ageless and timeless.................. LOVE it.  My music collection would not be without these. <br />After hearing this, I felt that Sting grew and changed with those of us that generation. Give it a few spins. The first two tracks were the most subtle and slowest to hook into. If the said reviewer did not take to those, each and every one the others are worth the trip for any listener -- old fan or new.   GREAT.
B000002LB6|4.0|With this album, more people were starting to take notice of the chemistry between Vince Clarke and Andy Bell. With such songs like &quot;It Doesn't Have To Be&quot; and &quot;Sometimes&quot;, Clarke is proving that he has a winning formula outside of Depeche Mode. A good album from start to finish, it was a prelude of things to come.
B00005214X|5.0|George Harrison, the quiet one, managed to put out argueably the best of the Solo Beatle efforts with this album. This also shows him as a completely unique talent on his own. He also  &quot;networked&quot; better with the muscial talent surrounding him as evidenced by the &quot;sidemen&quot; on this album, including ERIC CLAPTON, Dave Mason (Traffic, Mad Dogs), Billy Preston, (the fifth Beatle and the super rhythm section of the day with Jim Gordon and Klaus Voorman.<br />Some of the tracks like &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; were written during his Beatle days, and also appears in their &quot;History&quot; series.  The huge hit and first #1 solo Beatle record &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; appears, as well as his other top ten hit (and total un-beatlesque) &quot;What Is Life&quot;.  Other strong cuts include Bob Dylans &quot;If Not For You&quot;, FM Radio Staples &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; and and &quot;Wah Wah&quot; and the two versions of the classic &quot;Isn't ItA Pity&quot;, (Flip Side to My Sweet Lord&quot;.<br />This multi-CD set includes the famous &quot;JAM SESSION LP&quot; with songs such as &quot;I Remember Jeep&quot; ands &quot;Johnny's Birthday&quot;. This moves the album from great to a classic artifact.<br />This is wat I recommend:<br />Place all three CD's in your CD Changer<br />Light 4 scented Flicking Candles<br />Light up some incense.<br />Turn on the Black Light. Turn off other lights<br />Start Player<br />Close Your Eyes and Just Listen<br />We will miss George Harrison. This CD set will give all an example of why.
B00005MP58|5.0|Colin Firth!  Jennifer Ehle!  Exquisite Production!<BR>What else is there to say?<br />I developed a rather serious crush on Mr. Firth after seeing this one.  I have seen it several times, and it never fails to disappoint. <br />It's just plain great.
0452282152|3.0|Imagine a painting in which a girl sits at her dressing table, gazing out a window.  In the mirror on the table, you catch a glimpse of the painter and a sparsely furnished room.  Out the window, there is a suggestion of a city.  She is reserved, but looks towards the hurly burly of the market square with fear and wistfulness...  <br />Ok, enough of the tortured metaphors... and yet if there is a point to be made, it is that Girl With a Pearl Earring is a vignette that happens to run to novel length.  If you go in with the understanding that this is an unusually long short story,  the structure and scope of the book make more sense.<br />There are many things to like about Girl With a Pearl Earring.  Griet, a tile painter's daughter with an artist's eye for colour, tells the tale of her time as a maid in Vermeer's household.  For a time, she is drawn into Vermeer's perfect, private world of colour and light, but at a cost.  Griet's voice is generally true to period and character, and the glimpses of Vermeer and his household are consistent with what little is known of him.  Chevalier has done her research, and mostly resisting the temptation to bury her story in nifty but irrelevant facts, she instead provides a pleasant miniature of seventeenth century Delft.<br />And yet, there are a few relevant warnings.  Chevalier's language, though on the whole excellent, occasionally hit a jarring note that dropped me right out of the story.  That may well be a personal issue.  A couple of people with whom I discussed the book found Griet's cool narrative rather distancing, and certainly the tone of the book is rather cold and bleak.  Finally, don't read Girl With a Pearl Earring for a detailed, full face history and portrait of Vermeer.  Too little is known of him to provide more than a fleeting exchange of glances in a metaphorical mirror.<br />Ultimately, Girl With a Pearl Earring is an engaging read, but if you haven't already done so, brave the children's section and read _I, Juan de Pareja_ instead.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney sure has matured with this fantastic album.I admit,that I hated her when her first 2 albums came out (I was a fan of Limp Bizkit and hip-hop).But,a few weeks ago,my little brother bought this CD and he insisted,that I listen to this.Okay...I said:NO!<BR>But then he decided to be a slave 4 me (he brought me food etc.),when I listened to it,and I agreed!So,I started to listen to this CD and I was shocked!Is this Britney?This album rocked!<BR>It has a slight rock/funk scent,that's the best!here is the list of the songs:<br />1)Slave 4 U-Electrofunk tune,with mellow and sexy vocals.It just makes You wanna dance all da night! 10/10<BR>2)Overprotected-The most pop song on the album.The chorus is wonderful and the rappin' in the middle is superb! 10/10<BR>3)Lonely-A very independent and rough R'n'B song,with a very rockin' chorus and a great bridge.It's surely a potential single. 10/10<BR>4)I'm Not A Girl-A song written by Dido.The only ballad on this album.But,it's weak.The only bright things in this song are Brit's beautiful vocals.But still,the song disappoints me. 5/10<BR>5)Boys-This Hip-Hoppy retro tune has a future as a single.It's kinda freaky with it's sexy attitude.It's nasty and it's very mature.It kinda reminds me of Kelis' &quot;Get Along With You&quot;. 10/10<BR>6)Anticipating-Funky 70's tune,but yet again,kinda weak.The chorus is great,though!     6/10<BR>7)I Love Rock'n'Roll.Strong,rough and very electric and powerful!<BR>10/10<BR>8)Cinderella-Again,a popppy tune,but good.It's kinda metallic and freaky.Potential single. 9/10<BR>9)Let Me Be-A pure R'n'B song with a strong chorus.It has it all to be a single and it hooks you in a second. 9/10<BR>10)Bombastic Love-The best song on da album!It's a rock-opera,kinda like Pink' &quot;Most Girls&quot;.it's very dark and naive,with a horror movie score in the backgrund.I love it! 10/10<BR>11)That's Where You Take Me-Childish,yet good.It's like a mid-tempo lullaby.Sweet... 8/10<BR>12)What It's Like To Be Me-Mysecond fave from &quot;Britney&quot;.This can be a single.It's edgy,hard,electro,rockin' and with great vocals! 10/10
0679805273|1.0|The only similarity &quot;Oh, the Places You'll Go&quot; has to Geisel's work is the repetition and the drawing (which isn't up to his standards.) This book isn't worth reading to my 3 year old, my 6 year old, nor myself. It seems to have nothing but a philosophical agenda to push. It goes off on too many tangents - &quot;You'll go frightening places&quot;, but doesn't resolve them for the little kid. They have used big words to make a rhyme, where Geisel himself would make up a creative word instead. This stuff is nothing like Geisel and just confuses the buying public. Certainly Geisel was an artist of the first magnitude, but one would think a professional writer could have put a week's worth of thought into the writing and come up with a book that flows better and uses children's level words.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I bought this CD for the song \\"Get the party started\\", but my favorite song on this CD is Misery.  It reminds of Bette Midler from the movie the Rose.  Family portrait is very touching also.  I'm 37 and my kids are 13 and 9, I think it's really great we can enjoy the same music.
0064471837|2.0|If you're put off by the &quot;fact&quot; that this book is written for &quot;children and young adults&quot; - don't be. I'm looking at a 1977 edition of &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; by Ursula K LeGuin, which is, according to the publisher &quot;for readers of eleven or older&quot;.<br />Garth Nix is a good writer whose books are accessible by children as well as by adults - this is something to be applauded. Sabriel is an original classic and I'm looking forward to the sequels.<br />Check out Shade's Children for an equally-spooky but different premise entirely...
B00005QDW5|4.0|Echoes is a nice reminder of what made Pink Floyd one of the greatest bands ever. Sweeping soundscapes invite the listener into a musical world which sends chills up the spine and a smile on the face. The remastered 24bit sound quality must be comended. Let's hope Pink Floyd's original albums get similar treatment in the future. The songs sound superb even better than the 1993 reissues. For the most part the sequencing of the songs as one long piece works out well and its quite interesting to compare the interaction between songs. Essentially its the equivalent of taking an old picture and putting it in a new frame. I love the effort put into weaving these songs together from different era's but there are some drawbacks. I am completely baffled that there needed to be so much Momentary Lapse of Reason and Division Bell material. One song from each would have been appropiate. This basically leads to the exclusion of great songs such as Childhood's End from Obscured by Clouds or Cymbaline from the More soundtrack. Those would have been great additions. As for Atom Heart Mother, \\"IF\\" would have been a great inclusion instead of the wasted space When the Tigers broke free takes up on the album. The song serves more as a Roger Water's solo piece and not really a Pink Floyd Song. \\"IF\\" is as personal and heartfelt as the man ever got and is a very poignant reminder that the man wears his heart on his sleeve. The artwork is the usual high Floydian standard as Storm Thorgerson comes through again with shimmering images which delights the fan of all ages. For Pink Floyd fans young and old Echoes is a nice way to close out one of the greatest achievents in Rock and Roll. Shine on!
0205313426|5.0|I needed a book that would draw attention to ideas and elements of writing not easily recognized.<br />This is a small, to-the-point reference guide that I have used for my final edit on research essays. It greatly improved my writings by calling attention to my use of abstract words and adverbs--all with clear samples of proper/improper use to help you identify the difference.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants a condensed reference in grammer usage, and so did my college English Professor.
0060934719|5.0|I bought this book in a half price bookstore, thinking that it would be just a quaint little fantasy book, but I was wrong.  I started reading this late one night, and I couldn't put it down, not even for one moment.  It is possibly the best fanstay novel I have ever read, and it is written in the writing style that I enjoy: straight foreward.  It is a very easy book to read, and has a wonderful plot line to follow.  You quickly fall in love with the characters Gaiman creates and soon find yourself immersed in the world of Faerie, wishing that you were there yourself.  If you have never read fantasy before, consider this book for your first.  I guarentee that you will not be disappointed!
B00003CXPD|4.0|The plot of this movie is a mixture of THE FULL MONTY and FLASHDANCE, set against much the same North-of-England, working-class background as KES.  There is very little that struck me as truly original, although I enjoyed the scene when Billy's elder brother is chased by police about the mining town and he simply knows that every front and back door is going to be unlocked.<br />The choice of music for the soundtrack was bizarre -- early 70s T Rex (largely) for an early 80s movie?  But, given that most of the music of the 1980s was so dire, the choice of a deceased composer like Marc Bolan enabled the producers to get legal permission before they started filming (unlike THE BIG CHILL, for instance, where the actors are required to dance in the kitchen with no idea what tune will finally be overlaid on the soundtrack).<br />There are one or two very touching scenes -- such as Billy showing his ballet teacher the letter from his dead mother -- and you know you've been set up for them, but they're endearing nonetheless.  I couldn't understand why Billy's Dad had such a strong Scottish accent when everyone else in the family and community spoke with the lilt of North-East England.<br />Overall, not a great film from the production companies of Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson (Working Title / Tiger Aspect), but not a bad one.  The theme is one that I'd like to show to my children, but because of the swearing, this movie is rated 15 in the UK, which meant that the actor who played Billy was unable to  see it.
B00003CXDD|4.0|First of all, I heard the &quot;Before there were hobbits...&quot; nonsense, and I can only pray that they are referring to the world of film.  And even so, it wouldn't be entirely true.  Who could forget the animated The Hobbit and The Return of the King.  I prefer not to think about the animated Lord of the Rings *shudder*.<br />People should use a weighed scale when reviewing movies.  When you look at Willow, then look at Lord of the Rings, of course, it pales in comparison.  But Willow doesn't try to take itself that seriously.  It is, in the tradition of Lucas-affiliated movies (Indiana Jones, Star Wars, et al) a swash-buckling, often humorous adventure, that isn't scared to touch on some darker topics (come on, an evil sorceress attempting to sacrifice an infant isn't exactly Bambi).  Most people are familiar with the story.  A Nelwyn named Willow (Warwick Davis from Time Bandits) is charged with the delivery of a Daikini (big folk) baby to a vanquished sorceress, so she may one day overthrow the evil Bavmorda.  It's familiar territory, but that doesn't keep it from being a warm endearing tail.<br />Of course, you want to know about the DVD... The transfer is flawless.  It has crisp picture, and the 1988 effects have aged surprisingly well.  The sound is terrific, with an excellent score, complementing the movies beautiful settings.  The features are excellent, as well, but where are the deleted scenes? :( .  A commentary with Warwick Davis is included.<br />If you enjoyed the movie, buy the DVD, and you'll be pleased.  If you've yet to watch the movie, be forewarned: This isn't an epic of LOTR proportions.  Its just a nice little movie.
B00005214X|5.0|I have hesitated to write an online review of my favorite album simply because so many people have already written so many wonderful things regarding George Harrison's solo masterpiece &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. The recent passing of George Harrison has caused many of us forty and over crowd to remember what a sincere and kind human being George was. &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, was rock n rolls first boxed set released shortly after the break-up of the Beatles and quickly established George Harrison as a creative force on par with Lennon and McCartney. Since George was prevented from recording more than his usual one or two songs per Beatle album, he had a backlog of unrecorded songs that eventually became the majority of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. The album stayed at number one for nearly two months and is viewed by many critics as the greatest solo Beatle album of alltime. Powered by the mega hit &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, the albums spiritual feel dominates throughout. Songs like&quot;What Is Life&quot;, &quot;Awaiting On You All&quot;, Beware Of Darkness&quot;,&quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot; and &quot;Wah Wah&quot; all received heavy airplay on virtually every AOR radio station in the country. Top forty stations were playing &quot;MY Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;What Is Life&quot; to near saturation levels. An allstar cast was assembled in the recording studio including, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Gary Brooker, Ringo Starr, Dave Mason, Alan White, Carl Radle, and even Phil Collins contributed. The final ingrediant was the production of legendary producer Phil Spector and his wall of sound. George's contribution to rock n roll cannot be under-stated; he was the first musician to introduce the sitar into mainstream pop music and his &quot;Concert For Bangladesh&quot; was the prototype concert that gave birth to all these charitable concert's that have since followed like, &quot;Live Aid&quot;, Farm Aid&quot; and even the most recent &quot;Concert For New York&quot;. George Harrison was a humble and quiet legend who was more than just a Beatle, but a talent in his own right. I highly recommend this remastered 30th anniverary edition of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; which George remastered himself and contributed some fantastic new liner notes and designed a colorful new booklet with great new photo's.  The bonus track &quot;I Live For You&quot; and the instrumental version of &quot;What Is Life&quot; are real gems not to be missed. This is George Harrison's final gift to music fans everywhere. Thank-you George.

B00000064F|3.0|This is definitely not Drake's best album. It is, however, a quality<BR>recording. The only real criticism that I can offer  is that it is a little<BR>over produced.

This album, though, departs from that<BR>standard and includes multiple overdubs and, as I said, superfulous<BR>arrangements.<br />Do not, however, misunderstand me. I am a firm believer in<BR>Drake's genius as a songwriter and musician. Bryter Layter certainly stands<BR>as a testament to this. His vocals, as always, are majestic and<BR>otherworldly. His songs, as always, are so beautiful they make you cry for<BR>mama.<br />]This is a great album, but not necessarily the album I'd recommend to Nick<BR>Drake newcomers. The tracks that stand out are &quot;Fly&quot; and &quot;Poor Boy.&quot; The<BR>later has a very nice loungy feel to it.<br />If you're expecting a laid back folk album in the vain of<BR>Pink Moon, you will not find it in Bryter Layter. I would describe this<BR>album as something more like Van Morrison's Astral Weeks but suffering from<BR>an uncomfortable case of elevator strings.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I had viewed this movie a few years back on VHS. It stirrs the spirit.Truly stunning in terms of photography and the musical score is enchanting. The storyline is very gripping which is a study of personalities of two jesuits - Mendoza (De Niro) and Gabriel (Irons) - striving for a common goal but with different mindsets. The acting especially of Jeremy Irons is remarkable.<BR>A Must-See Movie. Simply Great. Awaiting the DVD release of this movie.
0385505833|3.0|Okay, I'll start by saying I'm a Grisham fan. I rank his last book, &quot;The Painted House,&quot; among my all-time favorites. So I came to this book with high expectations . . . BUT . . . even so, from one of the era's most popular writers, I expected more than an extended short story.  The premise is cute . . . the Krank family decided to &quot;skip  Christmas&quot; but in fact in skipping the trappings, they manage to skip the core of the season.  There are some excellent lines . . . like when the Krank's cancel their regular Christmas Eve party and one of their friends says, &quot;But what will we DO Christmas Eve?&quot;  Some of the images are memorable . . . imagine a 51-year-old man trying to wrestle a huge Frosty-the-Snowman onto his roof without being seen.  But the whole thing simply goes on tooooooo long.<br />And . . . the unknown (archetypal?) stranger at the end . . . Marty-what's-his-face who seems to know everybody tho' nobody knows him . . . is a potentially important touch that Grisham throws away.<br />As I say, it's got great potential as a short story.  It'll probably make a really funny movie.  But as a book . . . hey, I recommend waiting for the film.
B00003CX5P|2.0|First let me say that I grew up with Star Wars.  I know every line of Episodes 4 through 6 by heart, and they have always spoken to me on an emotional and spiritual level.  <br />Perhaps emotions and spirituality form part of the reason why I so revile Episode 1.  The Phantom Menace has neither emotion or spirit, simply a parade of the most complex special effects that George Lucas could muster.  Granted, the special effects are breathtaking in places.  In fact, parts of the movie are very good.  These parts are typically the ones with no dialogue.  The dialogue is wooden, and the actors, a formidable array of talent, still are unable to add any life to the movie.  Obi-Wan has no particular depth, nor does Qui-Gon, nor Anakin, nor Padme/Amidala, nor Palpatine, nor Jar Jar.  <br />While some have argued that the next movies will explain everything, I do not understand how 2 more movies can explain why Lucas occupied two hours of my life with utterly one-dimensional characters.  Others have told me to look at this movie in the context of the original trilogy and the movies to come.  I do not see how any other movies could possibly be relevant to THIS movie.  The fact is that the script is poor, the direction poor, and the acting is poor.  <br />As a prequel, in fact as the very FIRST movie in a story that spans 6 films, this film should above all establish character.  Instead Lucas settled for special effects.  I give this movie two stars.  I only give it two because of the wonderful effects and the exciting final lightsaber battle.  I refuse to give it more stars on the merits of the Star Wars name.  A bad movie is a bad movie regardless of its pedigree.  <br />And this is a bad movie.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Too bad the consumer from NY didn't see this film for what it is ... pure fun.  It's more of an adult flick than for kids with all the hidden jokes and one-liners. It's clever, it's funny, it's just a lot of fun. It's every bit as good as Toy Story. You have to remember Eddie Murphy plays the donkey! If you don't think Eddie Murphy can be hilarious, then you're taking life too seriously!
B00005RFAI|5.0|I really love this CD! Pink has a wide range of sounds and as she keeps putting out music, I can only see that she will improve!! Her song &quot;Misery&quot; with Steven Tyler is really torchy, then she does her dance hip hop, if you want a CD that really has alot of different sounds this is the one for you! My husband and I love this CD!!! Highly recommend!
B00000IOSU|5.0|Having got each and every album that Sarah McLachlan has ever released, some may think it pointless to also buy what is essentially her greatest hits.  Yes, I have all the songs, but any of you that have listened to 'The Freedom Sessions' should realise that Sarah would never cop out by producing carbon copies of songs she's already recorded.<br />The album is predominantly songs from her more successful 'Surfacing' and 'Fumbling' era which, whilst understandable, is a little disheartending to the dedicated fans.  Luckily, the DVD of 'Mirrorball' has a few extra songs on.  However, the album itself has some real corkers on, with it being quite possible to name every track as a stand-out.<br />Each song has been uniquely changed: 'Possession' and 'Fumbling Towards Ecstasy' are given a much more rockier feel to them, whilst 'Hold On' and 'Angel' acquire a much more heartfelt reality to them when sung live.  Sarah's amazing voice really comes through on this album and it's a good introduction to anyone new to her sound.  Basically though, this is a near perfect and gorgeous album that you will play over and over again.  It's intelligent, it's beautiful and it's even catchy.  What more could you ask?<br />One thing worth noting though is the inclusion of 'I Will Remember You', albeit minus a verse, which was previously only available on the 'B-Sides And Rarities' album.
B000005DQR|5.0|(This is Part One of a Two-Part Review.)<br />In November 1996, I was reeling from a summer in hell. After leaving a corporate-affiliated job and trying to figure out heads or tails about my future, I stumbled upon becoming an actor until I was able to start to make ends meet again. <br />On the closing night of a play I was in, I killed time in a Pasadena record store and stumbled upon a motherlode of music that would not only help cure me of post-play depression but would also help to make a painless transition into my current ( and more sober) state today. They were two used albums by trombonist Julian Priester &amp; Mose Allison and the CD debut of DJ Shadow known as &quot;Endtroducing&quot;.<br />Listening ot this album at 3:00 the next morning (after all the end-of-play festivities and well-wishings), I knew that the investment was a good one.<br />Mo' Wax, though being a great label, really has not put out many notable long-players that really stand the test of time. This has stood up very well five years later. In fact, this really is one of the very best albums that not only helps to maintain the constantly struggling vinyl culture but shows turntablism as a true art.<br />&quot;Endtroducing&quot; also stands alone as being one of the most emotional albums of this genre. There are so many textures and surprises spread throughout this masterwork, that you realize that this is more than just a white b-boy with amazing skills, but a modern day artist who knows about what makes a good groove connect with the listener. The man's use of samples, breakbeats and scratchings tell an awful lot about the history of music and it's 'revolutionary' transtions &amp; expressions.<br />From the Steve Reich-influenced &quot;Building Steam With A Grain Of Salt&quot;, to the excellent fusion piece &quot;Changeling&quot; to the atmospheric &amp; beat-heavy &quot;Midnight In A Perfect World&quot;, Shadow has mastered music that will not only haunt you for years to come but showhow much an artist was able to stretch way beyond the then (1996) limitations of commercial hip-hop, smooth jazz and flashy techno-noodling.<br />Five years later, &quot;Endotroducing&quot; still remains in my collection, still creating that inner-magic and making time stand still. This could have been an emotional journey and introspection into the rights &amp; wrongs of that cursed year. Instead, it makes me surer of the future and proud to still appreciate in the soul-deep that great music truly can create.<br />And that would only come full circle, five years later, with Shadow, Mo' Wax and David Axelrod.<br />(This piece is continued with the Mo' Wax David Axelrod CD review.)
6302250269|5.0|Where to start...Ridley Scott started out his film career with 'Alien', which blasted him into Hollywood with the help of a memorable dinner scene and Sigourney Weaver.  Other movies followed but none so good as this.  Here the road movie is turned on its head in that it's two women behind the wheel this time rather than the men that we're so used to seeing.  This movie can genuinely claim to have it all.  There are some absolutely laugh-out-loud scenes, dramatic car chases and some truly touching moments between the two friends.  Difficult scenes such as the rape scene early on are handled sensitively and without exploitation.<br />Basically Thelma and Louise (with Sarandon and Davis giving their best ever performances - and yes that even includes 'Dead Man Walking') decide to up sticks for a holiday, but find themselves on the run after shooting a man.  What follows is a fantastic escapist piece and it's easy to see why it is so popular.  It's also thought-provoking when Thelma says 'at least this way I'm having fun'.  Is fun defying the law?  The audience certainly has fun watching the two break the boundaries, but the end result of the film seems to be that true freedom comes at a cost.  This is seen in a spectacular end scene on the Grand Canyon that will have you on the edge of your seat.<br />True, the humour is obvious role-reversal.  True the majority of the male characters are presented as pigs.  True, it is one helluva ride that will stay with you for a long time.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|This movie gets a bad rep and it doesn't deserve it.  Yes, it is an action flick and yes, the main attraction is Angelina Jolie in that outfit but for fans of action/science fiction this movie will satisfy.  The action sequences are great and the special effects are top notch.  The story isn't all that bad either.  For fans of Indiana Jones, you absolutely have to see it.  It has all the cool archaeological events and relics with Angelina Jolie and the action sequences.  Hey, it's not going to be a classic but what the hey?  This is still good fun and a satisfying movie.

B000002534|3.0|This album was the parting shot in Santana's jazz-rock phase, following Welcome and the brilliant Caravanserai as well as various collaborations with Alice Coltrane and John McLaughlin.  Drummer Mike Shrieve, a crucial element in this band's sound and conception, would depart (he only plays on about 60% of this album); and increased pressure from Columbia Records would push Carlos Santana and Tom Coster to revamp the band with a more commercial sound.<br />  But regardless of the pressure, it seems like the band was running out of steam.  Borboletta is schizophrenic -- one half is 2nd-rate R&amp;B songs, the other half is intense fusion workouts.  Leon Patillo's vocals make you long for the gutsy but limited Gregg Rolie (though Patillo sounds kind of cool on &quot;Give and Take&quot;), the tunes aren't all that memorable, and the lyrics are downright embarrassing.  Most of the fusion jams fail to match the magic of Caravanserai and Welcome, though &quot;Promise of a Fisherman&quot;, rising gradually to a crescendo with wordless vocals, is glorious.  But too many rough spots make this an inessential purchase for casual Santana fans.
0064471047|3.0|This story is about four children (two brothers and two sisters). They are playing Hide-and-Seek one day, when Lucy hid in the wardrobe she expected to hit the back. She ended up in a whole new world. There is an evil witch trying to take control of Narnia. The four children embark on an exciting quest to stop the witch and save Narnia.<br /> I enjoyed this book for many reasons, but also there were some parts that were a little annoying. Some of the good things about this book are that the fantasy world Narnia<BR>seems very realistic. The characters are also very believable, they have human-like characteristics. The characters are animals, that talk and act just like humans. Some of the annoying things that are in this book are: the way C. S. switches between characters it some times confuses me. Also I didn't understand all of the words used. <br />All in all, if you enjoy fantasy, different worlds, and adventure you'll love this book!
0385505833|5.0|Dinner was an hour late because I could NOT leave this book unfinished!  I closed it with a smile on my face and a glimmer of the ol' Christmas Spirit in my heart.  I have already packaged it to be sent to my sister.  I am hoping she finishes quickly so we can pass it on to the next person--this is the best greeting card!!  A book that tells the parable of the Modern Day Christmas--craziness or simplicity?  Can we have both?!?!<br />Grisham writes characters we can identify with--with all the quirks and charms that we all have.  His cranky Luther reminds me of a half a dozen people I know (including myself!) and the urge to create the &quot;perfect Christmas&quot; is a universal theme suffered (!) by us all....
6303477259|5.0|On Digital Bits dated2/22/01, it was mentioned that &quot;We're still waiting for more details on Pink Floyd's Pulse, which is in production but has yet to be announced.

B00005QZ7U|2.0|Perhaps im in a different world, but it is, at least, the world of most people. I had great expectations with only one exception.  Quite frankly I didn't think N. Kidman could pull it off, But i was more then willing to give her the benifit of the doubt.<BR>Long ago I discovered that if i read the reviews of the so called critics it would often color my feelings of a movie.  Since I am the most important person in the theater the only thing that matters is did I, not the critics. like the film.<br />For me the Moulin Rouge doesn't really cut it.  Much of the time i was bored and the only redeeming thing was the Photography at times.  Ms Kidman does not do justice to what could have been a great role.  Madonna, even at her age, would have done a better job.  Her voice was never up to the part and the weakness of her acting was to me apparent.<BR>Mr McGregor did a passable job and is a rising star.  The result of this production is that it sank like a rock and was here today and gone gone gone tomorrow.  If the information in the papers is true and the studio is going to release this flawed film again in the after glow of 911 i predict that it will once again sink deep into the abyss.
B0000028PL|4.0|This is Living Colour's heaviest and darkest album yet.  They still manage to work this new sound into an awesome album.<BR>It's a shame they broke up.  Will Calhoun is a very impressive drummer, Vernon Reid is one of the fastest and most talented guitarists in music, both Muzz Skillings and Doug Wimbish were great on bass, and Corey Glover is one of the most talented vocalists in music.<BR>Lucky for us music fans, they recently got back together.<br />Pay special attention to Go Away, Ignorance is Bliss, Auslander, and Nothingness.<br />Enjoy.<br />-PFC
B00005214X|4.0|Dieses Album ist wie das zeitgleiche &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot; von John Lennon ein Relikt aus einer vergangenen Epoche. <br />Dreht sich Harrisons Triple-Album um religiöse Themen und Philosopien, bei Lennon sind es eher politische Aspekte und Ideologien. Beide sind excellent komponiert und haben hervorragende Beleitmusiker dabeigehabt. Die Botschaften kommen oft in schlichten fast simplen ideologischen Worten. Heute unmöglich, denke ich, da heute keine Ideologien mehr gefragt sind, jeder der nicht total naiv ist, mindestens eine höhere Schule und einen Studiengang besucht hat  und im Gespräch mit anderen - bei der Informationsflut - nichts neues mehr entdecken kann oder will, da die meisten Personen alles wissen, zu jeder Äußérung eine eigene Assoziation ungefragt vorbringen und emotional mit nichts mehr zu beeindrucken sind. Ideologien sind nicht mehr zu trauen. Mit den Beatles-Mitglieder verbinde ich eher &quot;Schule schwänzen&quot;, &quot;froh wenn die Schulzeit vorbei ist&quot; &quot;lieber Musik machen und die Schule schmeissen&quot; als intellektuelle Spitzfindigkeiten. Dies macht mir die Gruppe sympathisch - ähnlich wie Jethro Tull, die ähnlich dachten und handelten als Jugendliche (&quot;Teacher&quot;, &quot;Blackpool&quot;) und z.T. aus der Schule rausgeworfen wurden. <br />1971 war  es noch ganz anders - die meisten Menschen hatten Volksschulbildung,  Mittelschule war schon etwas besonderes - und die Zeit verging im Schneckentempo. &quot;All Things must pass&quot; ist schon wert zum Kauf wegen &quot;My sweet Lord&quot; und &quot;What is life&quot;. Von beiden hatte ich als Kind die schönen Gitarrenlinien -Intros von Eric Clapton im Gedächtnis behalten. Erst Jahre später erfuhr ich, daß es von Harrison stammt, der früher bei den Beatles war. Jedenfalls haben die beiden Songs den langen Sommer 1971 und die damalige Schlagerlandschaft mit zu verzaubern geholfen. Ähnlich, wie dies der erste Hit von Ringo Starr solo &quot;It Don't come easy&quot; (auch mit einem Eric Clapton Intro) zur gleichen Zeit tat. <br />Die ersten Hits der Solo-Beatles hatten wirklich Format, als ob sie lange ausgebrütet wurden, um endlich im Sommer 71 das Licht der Hitparaden zu erblicken. Manche Songs auf der CD sind etwas schwach, dafür sind die guten so gut, daß der Kauf lohnt. May George Harrisons  rest in peace.

0385491026|5.0|I've read all of Margaret Atwood's books, except Alias Grace. I read my sister's copy of Cat's Eye when if first came out and remember thinking: &quot;hmmm, kind of a rehash of themes from earlier books,&quot; specifically Lady Oracle, in which menacing ravines also figure. It seemed a so-so, traditional effort after the more obviously audacious Handmaid's Tale.<br />Recently, however, after 9/11, i went through a phase where I couldn't read, couldn't find a book that could hold my attention, lead me into its world, make me care.<br />Came upon Cat's Eye in a thrift store. Revelation: how much stronger and sure-stepped it seems to me the second time. Atwood's expert handling of the slow power shift between Elaine and Cordelia affected me more deeply this time, perhaps because I've lived longer now and have seen strong friends falter and others, once dismissed as &quot;quiet,&quot; emerge as the real, fierce talents.<br />Don't hesitate. Read it.

Well it looks like the version on here has half the songs. \\"Desert Rose\\" was advertised as recorded but it does not appear on this version of the album. Just don't want anyone to make the mistake I was about to. There are probably other songs missing as well. Something is different(...).

B00005QHPQ|3.0|His English  self-titled album debut is one of my favorite.I listened to it everyday, and I mean &quot;everyday&quot;. I bought it when it was release and I haven't get tired of it. So I was excited when this CD came out and grabbed it right away but I am mildly dismayed. I agree with one of the critics, Enrique needs to stay with romantic ballad. The passion of his voice is perfect for it.One felt like he is actually serenading you. I considered this CD pop dance just like most of the CD  nowadays. It doesn't rise up above the rest. &quot;Hero&quot;, which is a huge commercial success is the only one that sounds more like &quot;Enrique&quot;. Overall, is not a bad buy but it's just of those CD that after a few play you will forget about it.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I was truly amazed the first time I listened to this album. There really isn't one song that I don't like and with each listen, I find that I have a new personal favorite. Paul sounds good, his bass playing is outstanding and the new band is excellent.<br /><BR> Something else is amazing to me here too. I've read many of the fan reviews here, and while most are raving about this new album, I can't believe the extent to which some of the negative reviews have gone. For anyone to knock the lyrics the way they have, I'm led to believe that these people just don't like Paul McCartney from the outset and are just waiting to rip into him no matter what he does. I've never had a problem with Paul's so called silly love songs, which has been the basis for most complaints about him in the past. But this is not that type of album. The love songs here are more serious and therefore, more realistic and from the heart. <br /><BR> &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot; is very different from anything Paul has done in the past, and it's a nice change. I really like &quot;Lonely Road&quot;, which reminds me of the &quot;Ram&quot; album. &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot; is just, well... a really cool sounding song! It starts off soft and low, then it rocks a bit. <br />The title song, &quot;Driving Rain&quot; is very catchy. I've read where Paul has gotten ripped for the 1-2-3-4-5 lyric, but it works! If he wrote this with the Beatles, they'd say it's Paul using that simple phrase at the right time- GENIUS! Let's not forget that he wrote &quot;All Together Now&quot; (1-2-3-4, can I take a little more etc.) but that was O.K. right? John wrote words like &quot;I am the eggman, I am the walrus, goo goo ga joob&quot; but hey, that was the Beatles. How about not holding everything this guy does to such ridiculuosly high standards. It seems that every song he does gets disected down to each syllable and gets sent to the grand high exalted mystic critic to make sure it makes the grade. C'mon! It's a great tune, enjoy it for crying out loud! Paul has always written lyrics similar to this. Did &quot;1-2-3-4-5-6-7, all good children go to heaven&quot; bother anyone? If that didn't offend anyone's highly sophisticated &quot;expert&quot; ears, this shouldn't either.<BR><br /> In the past, Paul has been criticized for over-producing his songs. This album from beginning to end is not over-produced. It's not sloppy either. The band sounds great on the mostly instrumental &quot;Heather&quot;, they rock on &quot;About You&quot;, and really jam on &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot;. My new favorite on this album is &quot;Back in the Sunshine&quot;, a great bluesy piece.<br /><BR> On &quot;Riding Into Jaipur&quot;, Paul re-creates George Harrison's eastern sound, apparently as a tribute to him. Knowing how sick George was at the time it was recorded, it's kind of hard to miss the point. <BR><br /> &quot;Your Loving Flame&quot; is a very touching love song and shows Paul looking ahead. &quot;Magic&quot; is just as good, but has Paul looking back to when he first met Linda. He's relating his songs to his own life, something he never really did in the past. He reflects more on his life on &quot;I Do&quot;, another well written ballad.<br /><BR> He has some fun with &quot;Tiny Bubble&quot;, again capturing a different sound that's catchy. My least favorite song on the album is &quot;Spinning on an Axis&quot;. He uses a style that I don't think worked for him, but it's at least interesting in it's own way. <BR> <br />I find it interesting the way &quot;Wingspan&quot; had the two hands forming the &quot;Wings&quot; sign on the cover, and this cover has Paul holding up just the one hand. It seems like a nice little tribute to Linda. The pictures in the booklet are quite weird, or just too blurry to figure out. That's really my only complaint about the whole album.<br /> I thought &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; was an excellent album, but I like this one even better.  Both albumsshow some deep feeling, however, all of &quot;Driving Rain&quot; takes you on an emotional journey showing how Paul was hurting when he lost Linda, how he fights his way out (&quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot;), and finds happiness again (&quot;Heather&quot; and &quot;Back In The Sunshine&quot;).  How could anyone find fault in that.  He faced great loss and still comes away smiling.  Paul shows here that he truly can take a sad song and make it better!
B000002N3J|4.0|A strong collection of Madonna's ballads and film songs. A re-make of Marvin Gaye's I Want You, with Massive Attack, is a good mix of beats and whispers. I'll Remember, Take a Bow, You'll See and Live to Tell are my favorites. Pretty Versnatchy dress on the cover.
B00005CDNF|4.0|The eponymous ABBA LP was actually the 3rd by the Swedish quartet after 1973 Ring Ring and 1974 Waterloo. It is true that it shows a group still looking for its own identity. But here, Abba are starting to find their very own sound : SOS (which by the way was recorded and released as a single before Mamma Mia) is widely considered as a milestone in this perspective. Although the classic sound which will be present from 1976 is not fully blown yet on &quot;Abba&quot;, the whole album is already giant steps away from the two first albums : the overall quality is there, almost all the tracks ended up being released on singles : out of eleven songs, seven were A-sides in at least one country and thus made it to the charts. Even some of the glam rock attempts, like So Long or Rock Me, have some kind of charm about them, although they're obviously not what Abba did best. If you don't own any of the original albums yet, this might not be your first choice, but it should definitely not be forgotten.

0767840003|4.0|I love this movie.I like Miss Honey,who is Matilda's teacher best because she is very nice and she helps Matilda to solve her problems.At the end of the film,she adopts Matilda,gives her new hope and changes her life.I don't like Harry Wormwood,Matilda's father.In the scene where Mr Wormwood brings Matilda and her brother to the garage,he teaches them how to cheat the customers-decrease the mileage of cars sold.And he doesn't want to give Matilda a chance to study in the school and doesn't let her read books.  <BR>  I think the climax of this movie is where Matilda uses her telekinetic power to fight against the headmistress-Miss Trunchbull.<BR>   In this movie,the author gives Matilda a gift of telekinetic power and intelligence in studying.I think it is a very good story-line.In real life,I don't think people will have such an ability.If i can choose to have one of them,I think i will choose to have high intelligence in study,because I can get a higher mark in school and the knowledge from the books. I read is very useful.<BR>   In one scene,Miss Trynchbull picks up a schoolgirl by her ponytails,spins her around and throws her out of the window.If you hear that in real life,you may be shocked,but it happens only in a film-an imagination.The characters are very funny and we feel excited rather rather frightened .

B00003CXXI|2.0|I admit, I was tremendously excited to watch &quot;Shrek&quot; after listening to the immense hype...<BR>However, within a short time into the film I was repulsed by the darkness of the entire script and characters. <br />My first question is: This is supposed to be for kids? <BR>Secondly: People actually find this humor funny?<br />This movie does one thing well: takes the ugliest parts of our culture and makes an extremely sarcastic film that adds no beneficial value to your life. <br />Don't waste your time. <br />Parents: Don't let your children watch this terrible, anything but a children's movie.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I admit, Britney is a guilty pleasure of mine. I can't really justify this other than to say her music puts me in a good mood.  This, her 3rd album, is unquestionably her best one to date. In my opinion, the first half is better than the second, culminating in track #6, a peppy little disco ditty called &quot;Anticipating&quot; that serves no greater purpose than to make you want to hit the dance floor. The ubiquitous single &quot;I'm a Slave 4 You&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot;, which share a similar sound, have great beats and show Britney in an in-your-face display of raw sexuality. The album's single ballad &quot;I'm Not a Girl...&quot; is perhaps her best ballad to date. (Up until this one, I've always found Britney's ballads hard to stomach.) The album's second half is good too, though I find myself playing the first six tracks more than the last six. While she doesn't have a great voice by any stretch of the imagination, what she does have works for her ... and sometimes, that's all you need.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This movie has it all!  Hilarious one-liners, great sight gags, sci-fi inside jokes, heart, and a plot, to boot!  I'm not a Trekkie, but I recognized and enjoyed the Captain Kirk &quot;body language&quot; and chest exposure along with a host of other references to Star Trek.  The movie manages to poke fun without being mean spirited, remembering this BIG part of our national culture as fondly as most of us do.  I have a four year old who loves this movie so I've seen it about a zillion times and it still entertains me (THAT, as every parent knows, is the hallmark of a great movie!).  I still laugh out loud every time Sigourney Weaver freaks out with &quot;Let's get out of here before one of those things kills Guy!&quot; revealing her true feelings after repeated assurances to him that he is not going to be killed just because he's an extra without a last name.  Sam Rockwell is hilarious when he grabs the vox to give the Captain important advice during a desparate battle with a giant rock &quot;I know! ... Look around you.  Can you fashion some sort of rudimentary lathe?&quot;  I could go on and on, but, I'll spare you if you just promise to get the movie, okay?
B000001ELP|3.0|With time, Music for the Elder has proven that it was the wrong record at the wrong time for Kiss to make. It not only sold poorly but it contribute to speed Ace departure from the band. The Elder was an idea by Gene Simmons about a movie but it was an incomplete and unfocused idea. This clearly reflects on the record as the songs, as a whole, do not connect in order to make a clear concept such as Pink Floyd's The Wall or Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime. As stated by the band members now, Kiss was unclear on its musical direction and what was needed in order to connect to its fan base. Bob Erzin, who produced 1976's Destroyer, was in the producer seat again but the tensions within the band, with the management and with the fans seems to have shadowed his work as this is not only Kiss more unfocused work but Ezrin's as well. Nevertheless, the album has its bright spots with songs like A World Without Heores and The Oath. Kiss went to produce one of its stronger records of its carreer after this one, Creatures of the Night. But the even this new album sold poorly due to the commercial failure of Music from the Elder. Is it a bad album? I do not think so. Its was just not the album Kiss need it to make at the moment.
B000001G8A|4.0|This recording is very good.  Domingo is ideal as Johnson. Zubin Mehta conducts Puccini brilliantly: well-paced, colorful, passionate, sparkling.  Milnes sings with all his assets of a beautiful, a dark, and a ringing voice.  And Carol Neblett sings firmly with all the notes.  But her singing seems as if it is for a supporting role not as if she were the vocal track for Liberty Leading the People, she doesn't command the opera.<br /><br />Probably the best Fanciulla, with good sound, is with Tebaldi, Del Monaco, MacNeil, and with Capuana conducting.  Though Tebaldi is not one of my favorite singers she has a magnificent voice--that seems to give her whatever she asks of it.  She also sings with passion and sensitivity.  Del Monaco is not great with character but he has a wonderful ringing sound and a big male persona.  I think he is excellent here.  MacNeil as Rance is very solid; he sings with a beautiful line.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there isn't a completely knockout studio recording.Gobbi, and Jessye Norman.  I think she would do justice to the role and perhaps she will.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Once you say that THIS is the version of the movie the director really wanted...what else is there?<BR>Re-mastered audio, special effects added to MATCH the original 1979 version(so they don't ruin the continuity), and the first damn time you could buy it in a decent format(sorry LD owners), full running commentary by the director and hours of documentaries.<BR>I own over 200 DVD's; and I must say that this is one of the few that has lived up to my expectations of what a DVD can be.

B00005RFQ5|2.0|As a Prince fan(friend) I would love to be able to listen to this album's incredibly adventuress and inspiring music. It symbolizes what Prince used to represent as an artist. But the lyrics on &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot; contradict the music. Instead of promoting inclusivity, freedom, and love, it preaches the subjection of women, and the banishment to oblivion of all those that don't adhere to Prince's religious beliefs. With albums like &quot;Lovesexy&quot;, &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;, and most importantly &quot;Around the World in a Day&quot;, Prince brought to us all the idea of a utopia of love, peace, and funk. I bought &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot; with the hope that it would extend this vision. Instead, it taints it. I know that Prince still believes in this vision, because of the contradictions in some of the songs, but he has let his new religion exclude all the fans(friends) that formerly believed in his message of tolerance. For the first time ever I don't feel like a part of Prince's party. In my opinion, the message of &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot;, ruins an album full of great music.
0393316041|5.0|The trouble with this book is you never want to put it down and in the end are left with the thirst for more about Feynman's life in his own words that make you laugh and think at the same time. If you have come so close to this title as to read this review, I suggest you don't waste further time and read it NOW! And be amazed how much can be achieved by a man in one single life in fields so diverse in nature. (Don't forget to keep reminding yourself that he was a genius (maybe an alien) lest you start comparing the achievements ;-))

B00003CXDD|5.0|Despite Val Kilmer's need of a bath and a toothbrush, his charm as a rogue is priceless. It's not often that a leading man displays a refreshing lack of vanity. His ex, Joann Whaley-Kilmer, rescues the rogue and demonstrates via her behavior, the worth of focusing beyond the bonds of self. The Me-Me-Me. selfish, and irresponsible street mentality disappears as Val embarks on a quest in the battle of good and evil. My spouse, and my 3 sons (4,10, and 13)enjoyed the movieas much as I did. There's a little bit of everything in the story-line to please all ages, genre, and sexes. Although men were relieved that Willow was not a Chick Movie, I must say ladies that Val cleans up extremely well. Oh, The scenery and exceptioal too.
0312287550|5.0|RIVER GOD is an amazing epic novel of Ancient Egypt that sweeps you away in its story of love, deception, loyalty and honor.  I came to love the main characters, Taita, Lostris and Tanus, as dear old friends.  Smith's style of storytelling creates such an elaborate yet realistic picture of their lives that you can't help getting emotionally connected to them and thus enjoy their victories as well as mourn their losses.  This is the first book I have ever read that takes place in Ancient Egypt and was amazed at his descriptions of the palaces, the Nile, the desert, etc.  You think Smith coined the term &quot;local color&quot;.  Can't wait to start reading THE SEVENTH SCROLL and then WARLOCK.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This soundtrack takes you to another world whenever it plays. Playing it straight through is almost as good as seeing the movie, you can feel the Quidditch brooms sweeping around you, the goblins at Gringotts staring at you, and the magic in front of your eyes. That feeling you get when you see the movie (or read the book) of magic and surprise and suspense is all summed up onto this instrumental soundtrack. The main theme is intense, delicate, magical, mortal, and powerful. It is as though the magic is being brought to life. Music perfectly made for a perfect movie and book series. It makes you want to run out and change the world, jump out of bed each morning and greet the new day...makes you feel the magic.
B00004TS0E|5.0|This is the best Christmas movie I have ever seen!
059035342X|5.0|This book opens me up to a new world of imagination and way of looking at the world, not to mention a variety of fictional places, things, and characters with interesting names. The things that really stick in my memory are &quot;Quidditch&quot;, &quot;The Golden Snitch&quot;, and &quot;Devil's Snare&quot;. Not to mention the revolting &quot;Bertie Bott's Every-Flavor Beans&quot;, sort of a Jelly Belly Spoof, only with flavors like *cough* earwax. And the names make me laugh, like Malfoy, Dumbledore, and Valdemort. (you-know-who!) LOL I know this may sound like a cliche, but Harry Potter is cool no matter what age you are. I remember I started reading my younger sisters' copy of the Sorcerer's Stone, until she caught me. The madness and craze drove me to see the movie, then I became totally obsessed, and I had to buy the copy of the book! I must say it was a very riveting book and has gotten me into the habit of reading again! Thank you J.K. Rowling!
0312243022|4.0|The Hours was an enjoyable and challenging book which alternated among 3 sets of characters in each chapter.  This one is not brain candy, but a true novel that makes you think.  Each set of characters is unsatisfied with some element of life.  The characters were very alive with real emotion: the frustration of the suburban mother who just wants to be alone to read; the confusion of a lesbian mother who feels like a sell-out; the emotional breakdown of an author who is both brilliant and fragile.  I absolutely loved the ending of this book.  Definitely worth reading, but not my favorite book that I plan to re-read.
6304510861|5.0|The movie begins as it ends.  IF you have not seen this one, this is truly one of the best movies made in the last ten years.  It is dark, evil, mysterious, and full of vices.  Sound interesting ?  Characters in the movie represent a man's conscience and weaknesses.  The man whispering into the intercom in the beginning is the same man listening on the other end.  Evil never goes where he is not invited.<br />There are multiple websites devoted to this movie.  Check them out, but see the movie first and get hooked !!!
B00005QZWI|5.0|The soundtrack to &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is magnificent.  Of course I do not know how well it complements the movie (it doesn't open until Dec 19th), but I can say that it has the same beauty that the books themselves do: both are obviously works of creation that have had their creator's complete love and devotion.<br />I can't really say which of the selections I like the best, because all are wonderful in different ways.  The hobbit music, for example, is lovely, rustic,and sparkling.  The music for Rivendell and Lothlorien is majestic and ethereal.  Music for chase scenes and other dangerous moments is heavy, ominous, fast paced and foreboding.<br />None of Tolkien's own songs are included on this CD (I hope the movie will have &quot;Ai Elbereth Gilthoniel&quot; at least), but there is one song &quot;In Dreams&quot; which has the words &quot;I will go there and back again.&quot; &quot;The Theme for Aragorn and Arwen&quot; is also very Tolkien in spirit, though I can detect none of Tolkien's own words in that one.  The final selection &quot;May It Be&quot; is probably to be played over the  credits, and makes a suitable coda for what will be a very sad but inevitable finish.<br />This is a beautiful CD which is a masterpiece worthy of the books.

B000002VCQ|5.0|In 1985 the music world welcomed a new shining star,Whitney Houston. In that year the daughter of Cissy Houston, former backup singer for Elvis Pressley, and cousin of Dionne Warwick, released her debut album. It went on to break numerous records, it has sold over 14 million copies in the U.S. alone to date. This album, executive produced by music genious Clive Davis is amazing. The best song on the album is &quot;The Greatest Love Of All&quot;, the song that send Whitney into the stratosphere. It also includes &quot;You Give Good Love&quot;, a pure pop ballad with smooth soul. Then two more pop songs that everyone loved &quot;Saving All My Love For You&quot;, Whitney's fist number one and first Grammy Award Winning Song and &quot;How Will I Know&quot;, an amazing pop song that will make even the most boring people boogie. Plus there are two very good duets with Jermaine Jackson and Whitney's best never released song in my opinion, &quot;All At Once&quot;. This album has sold 14 million copies in the U.S. and another 8 million overseas, produced three #1 Pop Singles, three #1 R&amp;B Hits, three #1 AC Hits, and a number one dance hit (How Will I Know). This album is wonderful, a great mix of youth, grace, pop, and soul, truly a must have.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|The best in movie added to the special effects and intense action are Angelina Jolie and Jon Voight.<br />The movie suffers from spetacular scenes based in The Matrix and lacks on more romanticism and more erotica that should be the needs of Tomb Raider fans.<br />Good interior and exteriors filmed in locations on Cambodia.<br />Good entertainment.
0385505833|1.0|John Grishams style of writing just doesn't please me. I find his books a low trashy style of novel very popular these days. His writing style, devlopment, and sentence structure reminds me of 12 year old writer!
B00000490M|5.0|An absolute classic.  Miyagi is the closest a human being has ever come to becoming Yoda. Delightfully cheesy totally 80s soundtrack to boot- anthems like &quot;You're the Best Around&quot; will have you singing in the shower for weeks. If you've been hiding in a cave since the 80s and have never seen this, and are not looking for anything too heady, you will not be disappointed.  <br />I admit without shame that it is quite possibly my favorite movie of all.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This album is antoher in what is hopefully a long line of greats!!!  I first saw Diana playing in the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival in Moscow, Idaho (Pleasant surprise) and have been in love with her style ever since.  Listening to her grow with each album has been very rewarding.  I remember how awestruck she looked to be sharing the stage with Hapmton and now she commands the same feelings from others.  Great album, great voice, great talent!!!!
B00005RIKD|4.0|One cannot listen to this CD without noting the significance of the recording date (9/11).  The opening cut is heartbreaking.  Sting is downbeat and slowly brings the concert to a nice simmer.  Then, midway through, he really starts to cook and the whole project gets in full swing.  Overall an amazing recording.  Much more mature than his last live recording.
0783226837|5.0|This movie may not be a boring, worthy classic like &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; or even an exciting, worthy classic like &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, but it is one of my top personal great-Hollywood-popcorn-entertainment all-time classics.  When my kids (3 &amp; 1 years old) grow into monster-movie loving pre-teens I plan to introduce them to this one.  It's got it all, starting with a very appealing cast (I could just adopt Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon,) very tense moments and a smart &quot;how to get rid of that last monster&quot; solution that doesn't involve the military or alpha-waves or other standard dumb ending.  I haven't watched the special features of the DVD in a while, but I remember thoroughly enjoying the director's comments, special effects featurettes and alternative ending.<br />And I'll never, never get tired of watching Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon doing &quot;rock, paper, scissors&quot;, bargaining with the store owner, or telling the road workers about the maniac in the neighborhood.<br />Yeah, I think I'll introduce my kids to &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;, &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, &quot;Rear Window&quot; and &quot;TREMORS&quot;! (among others, of course.)
0440219078|2.0|This book starts off well with a great story line.  Jonas lives in a society where everything is controlled by rules.  The rules were decided long ago to eliminate any individuality, any fear, any worry or anxiety.  But, as he learns when he is made the Receiver of Memories, a lot has also been lost.  There is no color, no music, no love and no pain.  However, what starts off as a great story with great potential quickly looses its thrust.  It's almost as though the author didn't know how to end the story and grabbed the first thing that came to mind.  The ending leaves the reader with many questions.  That in and of it self is not bad as long as they are thought provoking questions.  But these are not.  Rather, the reader is left asking where the rest of the story is.  This book leaves the reader flat.  There is no closure.  Perhaps that is what the author wanted but, if it is, then she chose to give up the story for the sake of a momentary effect on the reader.
B00005QDW5|5.0|First, let me say right off the bat that I'm hardly a Floyd connoisseur. I've always been a casual fan, owning a couple of discs, and basically familiar with thier 70's heyday albums (Dark Side thru Wall). But I do consider myself a music fan, and as far as compilations go, this one's great.<br />I can't believe so many of the comments I've read that this package is not worth the $$. What did you expect? For one, if you can fit all of a band like Floyd's greatest songs onto a 2 disc set without leaving anything worthwhile off of it, then they can't really be that great, can they? And sure, songs like \\"Mother\\", \\"Have a Cigar\\", \\"Not Now John\\", or other pre-Dark Side songs may be more worthy than say, \\"Keep Talking\\" or \\"Sorrow\\", but to be a true, carreer spanning retrospective, every period should be represented. <br />Could there have been a third disc? Of course, Floyd was around for a long time and had a lot of worthy material. But then the same complainers who say they're \\"gouging\\" their fans would complain about the price even louder (and as far as I'm aware, nobody in the band is holding a gun to anyone's head, forcing them to purchase this - if you don't like the song selections, don't buy it - where does this gouging (...) come in?).<br />Bottom line, \\"Echoes\\" is a thorough musical history of Pink Floyd. If you think of it that way, rather than a \\"Best Of\\", which the subtitle labels it as, than you'll see it's a great set to have in your collection.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I've read countless reviews calling Incubus &quot;sellouts&quot; because of the musical maturity and development that they have shown brilliantly on &quot;Morning View&quot;. These &quot;fans&quot; seem to think that bands cannot be creative, or have to stay loyal to their fans by playing the same style of music for their entire careers so that the band can be pigeonholed by their &quot;dedicated&quot; fans.<br />Guys you're missing the point. Incubus might not show the same constant thrash-rock style that they demonstrated with their early release &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;, but this new album just demonstrates how good this band is. Each new album shows the band's immense creativity in songwriting ability and experimentation. Sorry guys, this band has moved far beyond the straight alt-metal rock that you guys are used to, simply because their talents are too great to concentrate on one style of music.<br />and to those fans who consider Incubus a &quot;TRL, MTV&quot; style band now that the mainstream is finally starting to appreciate their music, shame on Incubus for writing songs that people like. They should write hardcore style, one dimensional songs that no one will like, right? eh why dont we waste the talents of a band that possesses this much talent.<br />This album is a definite buy, no matter what these supposed &quot;fans&quot; say. 5 stars.
B00000IQW0|4.0|This is the pilot episodes of the great nostalgic 70's era made-for-TV series.  Though some say this is a cheapo knock-off of Star Wars, I personally rewatched this show with great fondness and recommend everyone to buy a copy now.  And be amazed at the extremely high production value achieved on TV for that era. I mean, the money is way up front in your face (...)The sets, models, effects still stand exceedingly well up to the test of time, and this version is masterfully remastered (pardon the pun) for DVD. Goferrit and hit turbo-boost!!!!  By Your Command!!!
0767817664|3.0|First of all, I LOVED this movie as a kid.........and I still do.  I gave the DVD edition 3 stars because I felt that soo much more could have been done for this movie.  There should have been commentaries, deleted scenes, bloopers........any extra footage to help boost this edition.  This is such an awesome movie.  I've seen DVDs for movies that were far worse...but had better DVD packages(like Vamp....and I love it just the same!)  Other than that.........the transfer to DVD looks great.......even though it is dated!!!
B00003CWPL|2.0|come on, you 5-star-reviewers, remain on the carpet, as we say in germany ... this is not a masterpiece, but maybe a good joke of david l. watching this film is (to me) like going to the dentist for 2 hours or like having to eat huge portions of snot with vomitus at the restaurant.<BR>there seem to be people who enjoy this kind of activities ... please, feel free and do not be offended.<BR>when i saw it in the theater, most members of the audience where pale young people wearing dark clothes. i asked one (beautiful) young black dressed lady sitting next to me, how she liked the movie ... she simply answered: 'wonderful ...'.
0920668364|5.0|I see many differing opinions written here about this book. I think the book is wonderful. The book is about the cycle of life. It describes a Mother's unconditional love for her Son through the years. No matter what he does and how frustrated she is with him, that love never goes away and is eventually passed on from Parent to Child to Parent through the generations. It really gets to the bottom of a parents feelings for their children. I have read the reviews that have given this book low marks. Some people have even went so far as to call this book creepy. While I agree if a Mother in the &quot;real world&quot; drove across town and crept into her Son's room to rock him, it would be disturbing. In this book though, it shows that the Mother continues to love her Son through his whole life even even though there are boundaries separating them. I view this in the same spirit as I do Cinderella. A Step-Daughter that is used like a slave until a fairy god-mother comes and rescues her so she can fall in love with a Prince after one dance. One of Cinderella's messages among many others is just because people treat you bad, what matters is the person you are on the inside and that there is always hope. (unfortunately there are not fairy god-mothers because there sure are a lot of people that could use one.)
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This film really impressed me! I hope this film gets the oscar  nominations it deserves.I think the film will at least walk away with a Best Original Screenplay nod. To anybody out there skip \\"Harry Potter\\" and rent this soon to be classic!!! This would without a doubt be considered my favorite film of 2001!!(...)
B00005O3VC|5.0|In the early 1970's the Monty Python troop (Michael Palin, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, and Terry Jones) stars from the immensely popular television series Monty Python's Flying Circus began producing, with the help of a fundraising concert headlined by Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd (You lie!! No, I didn't!), initial photography on what would later become (from all my extensive years of movie watching) the single most unforgivably sidesplitting, enormously irreverent, shrewdly perceptive, unremittingly uproariously aggressive, gruesomely hysterical, and endlessly quotable comedies EVER. Not even Mel Brooks's Best Efforts (The Producers, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein) comes very close to the revolutionary medieval merriment sustained in this royal purebred of cult classics. BAR NONE. No contest here.<BR> <BR>Endlessly stockpiled with hauntingly hysterical sketches that will probably never leave your mind (no matter how hard you try) including, The Knights Who Say Nei, The Self-Abusing Monks (Eah aay ess eay dom eay nay), The Black Knight, The Trojan Rabbit, the Ever-Appearing Verbally Abusing French (I don't want to talk to you no more!!!), The Enchanter Named Tim, The Killer Bunny, The Bridge of Death (What is the capital of Hysteria?), The Old Woman Named Dennis, and so many countless more great sketches to include here that I'd die trying. Monty and Python and the Holy Grail remains an ever-enriching mirthful cult-classic that just seems to improve with age. Since Columbia has a bountifully hefty new special edition of the Holy Grail out now there should be no excuse, if you've never seen it (I think I'll go for a walk!!), just drop everything your doing (including Bringing Out Your Dead) and go experience this life changing movie today. You won't be disappointed, just tell them the Knight Not Appearing In This Film sent you, and they'll know what to do.<br />As for the options on the special edition here's a run-down:<br />Disc One:-&quot;21st Anniversary&quot; cut of the film running an extra 24 seconds;  -Anamorphic Widescreen; -Dolby 5.1 track; -Original Mono Track; -Audio commentary with Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin; -subtitles &quot;for people who don't like the film&quot; (you get the text from Shakespeare's Henry IV instead); -an &quot;on-screen screenplay&quot; feature which lets you read the screenplay as you watch the film; -&quot;Follow the Killer Rabbit&quot; feature; <br />Disc Two: &quot;Three Mindless Sing-Alongs&quot;; -&quot;The Quest for the Holy Grail  Locations&quot; featurette; -&quot;How to Use Your Coconuts&quot; educational film; -&quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Japanese&quot; (with English subtitles); -the BBC Film Night special &quot;On Location with the Pythons; -an interactive cast directory; -still galleries with Terry Gilliam's original sketches and behind-the-scenes photos; -&quot;A Load Of Rubbish&quot; with mystery items; -unused ideas and other material; -two trailers <BR>and web-links.<br />Both discs represent the absolute final word resource for EVERYTHING and I do mean everything you'd need to know about the Python's greatest film. An Absolute Necessity for any Python Fan!! <br />P.S. You can't base a system of government just because some watery tart threw a sword at you.
B000000NN4|5.0|Vangelis, one of the biggest names of electronic music, has always been a very frustrating figure to me. He'd release some fantastic albums that just simple amazes me, and some truly wretched albums. For me, Albedo 0.39 is simply one of the greatest electronic albums I have ever heard! The ever overrated Chariots of Fire is absolutely nothing compared to this gem (in fact I'm pretty sure some people are turned off by Vangelis because of Chariots of Fire - don't judge all his works by that soundtrack album). Except for the Aphrodite's Child albums, Albedo is by far his more rock oriented album. The music here is all upbeat and very easy to get in to. Some of these songs might be familiar to you if you watched Carl Sagan's Cosmos, as &quot;Pulstar&quot; and &quot;Alpha&quot; were featured on that series. The album is also full of killer jamming as well, which more than demonstrates Vangelis was really enjoying himself big time on this album. Plus I love how the album ends with the title track which includes spoken, educational dialog about the Earth and its features (like diameter, distance from sun, and of course, its albedo). So forget Chariots of Fire, if you want real Vangelis, you must have Albedo 0.39, even if you're not much for Vangelis.
0060934719|4.0|This is not as good as Neverwhere or the best of the Sandman comics, but it is still very good. Gaiman writes in a style that doesn't seem to be much, but in reality it is extremely mannered. This is a good book if you like the old time, Lord Dunsany-style, pre-Tolkien fantasy.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor is flat out enjoyable. Yes, the love story is overdone, some of the action is overdone, and there were a few liberties taken. However, I did not say Pearl Harbor was a cinematic masterpiece. It's just the type of movie that leaves you wishing you could watch it one more time (as long as you take a short intermission).<br />The DVD features plenty of special features and provides just enough information regarding the actual events surrounding December 7. In fact, my only beef with the DVD is that there will be a special three disc version released in May. <br />If you consider yourself emotional or patriotic, then I find it hard to believe that you would not be able to find anything to enjoy in this movie. Jon Voight is amazing as FDR and the attack sequence is disturbingly real (come on, it's rated PG-13).<br />In the end, Pearl Harbor serves as an excellent reminder to what happened on December 7. Pearl Harbor may have a few too many explosions, or a little too much love, but it will still leave you in awe.
0380017229|5.0|Charles Dickens almost singlehandedly rescued what we in the early 21st Century consider \\"traditional\\" Christmas celebrations from extinction. His crusade against the Industrial Revolution's Utilitarianism, and Mammonism (Scrooge is the archetypal Utilitarian) is part of the reason behind this story. Some folks who know something of early Victorian England see that when they read this classic. But for most of us this underlying theme, plus the colloquial 19th Century English are a mystery.<BR>The \\"Annotated Christmas Carol\\" neatly solves this issue by fully explaining the story behind the story, and defining some of the more obscure contemporary references. Dickens basically wrote the story because he needed money quickly: his previous novel was only lukewarmly received by the public. Additionally, his desire to awaken a social consciousness in the British upper-class led him to a short story format. Given his long standing committment to keeping the celebrationsn of Christmas alive, the result is, for the English-speaking world anyway, as much a tradition as a tree and presents. <BR>The format is exactly as that for the first edition published in 1843, along with reproductions of Leech's original illustrations. Well researched and written notes in the columns allow the reader to follow along with explanations of terms, identification of likely locations, and the development of the ongoing theme. The book could likely benefit with a new edition, as the commentary seems to be written around 1975 or so. Even so, this is a book that any Dickens enthusiast will want to own, any Christmas Carol enthusiast for that matter...<BR>Highly Recommended.
B00004Z459|5.0|I first heard about Linkin Park when I heard their song, &quot;In The End&quot;, on the radio. I thought it was cool, so I went out and bought this disc. Well, I have to say that I'm glad I did! HYBRID THEORY is a great CD. I was just reading a lot of reviews here on this website about this album and most of the reviewers were coming from guys. Pretty typical, since most guys like Hard Metal Rock. I am not the hugest Hard Metal fan, but there is some Hard Metal that I like and I am one who appreciates all kinds of music. Anyway, &quot;In The End&quot; is definitely the best track off this CD. The lead singer of Linkin Park sounds like the lead singer of Creed, who sounds like the lead singer of Pearl Jam! Other tracks I like from this CD are &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, &quot;Points of Authority&quot;, &quot;Crawling&quot;, &quot;Runaway&quot;, and &quot;Forgotten&quot;. Those are all highlight, stand-out tracks. The lead singer of Linkin Park has a great voice, and Linkin Park's music is original. If you enjoyed HYBRID THEORY, then I also recommend Staind, 3 Doors Down, Limp Bizskit, Pearl Jam, the Calling, Five For Fighting, and Lifehouse. This is a fantastic CD!
B00005O3VC|5.0|In the early 1970's the Monty Python troop (Michael Palin, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, and Terry Jones) stars from the immensely popular television series Monty Python's Flying Circus began producing, with the help of a fundraising concert headlined by Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd (You lie!! No, I didn't!), initial photography on what would later become (from all my extensive years of movie watching) the single most unforgivably sidesplitting, enormously irreverent, shrewdly perceptive, unremittingly uproariously aggressive, gruesomely hysterical, and endlessly quotable comedies EVER. Not even Mel Brooks's Best Efforts (The Producers, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein) comes very close to the revolutionary medieval merriment sustained in this royal purebred of cult classics. BAR NONE. No contest here.<BR> <BR>Endlessly stockpiled with hauntingly hysterical sketches that will probably never leave your mind (no matter how hard you try) including, The Knights Who Say Nei, The Self-Abusing Monks (Eah aay ess eay dom eay nay), The Black Knight, The Trojan Rabbit, the Ever-Appearing Verbally Abusing French (I don't want to talk to you no more!!!), The Enchanter Named Tim, The Killer Bunny, The Bridge of Death (What is the capital of Hysteria?), The Old Woman Named Dennis, and so many countless more great sketches to include here that I'd die trying. Monty and Python and the Holy Grail remains an ever-enriching mirthful cult-classic that just seems to improve with age.

B00005OWIU|5.0|The Harry Potter soundtrack is just as beautiful as the movie.  My family and I saw the movie yetserday.  I had bought the soundtrack for my sister the day before. We have been listening to it constantly ever since!!  This music is exceptional, haunting and absolutely mystical and it seems to fit each of the movie's scenes perfectly.
0380977273|5.0|As a horror novel, this book fails. As a dark fantasy it succeeds. The book will not really scare anyone who reads Stephen King or even watches the X-files regularly. Mind you the book has the best prose I have ever read. At times I could of sworn that I was reading poetry not prose. If you're looking for a traditional scare look else where. If you are looking for an extremely lyrical and stylized novel that deals with the battle between good and evil in the soul.
B000000JO3|4.0|OK, folks, this is the real thing. If your idea of what punk rock is was formed by pop-metal bands like Greenday or the Ramones, you're gonna be in for a shocker here. This stuff is raw, unpolished, honest and devoid of all pretensions. The music is pretty pathetic in itself, but the genuineness and alienation of the punks seems to come through clearer than ever here. Minor Threat epitomised the &quot;straight edge&quot; movement within the punk community, a sub-culture of punks that most people probably never knew existed, as the general idea of a punk that the public has is of a bunch of hard-drinking, hard-hearted dope fiends who don't give a damn about anything. The sort of &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude that is characteristic of the straight-edgers does come through a tad much for my tastes, however. Still, the honesty and integrity of the music comes out loud and clear here, and for that this album is worth listening to. Ian's vocals sound sadly weak and unthreatening today especially with the really aggressive bands like Slayer around (who, by the way, recently did a few MT cover songs on &quot;Undisputed Attitude&quot;), but even so, the originality of what they were saying blows generally silly bands like Slayer or Venom out of the water. Not for all tastes, but worth a listen.
B00005QK3W|5.0|First time around - nothing special.  Second time one or two of the songs began to show more than I thought.  Tenth time around and there's no question that this is up there with McCartney's best solo records.  The melodies have returned along with the tempo changes, there's more passion in his singing (and his approach) - and the off-beat arrangements and production give the album a distinctiveness he hasn't had for a long time. My goodness what's going on? - an Elton John album that better than anything he's done for 25 years and now a new McCartney album following the same path.  Great, great album....
B00005OWIU|5.0|This is probably the best thing I have ever heard from John Williams. I usually dont like soundtracks but this one is a must have for the holiday season. In my opinion it even tops all the Star Wars music he did.
B000002HMH|1.0|I was so expecting this album to kick the snot out of me when i bought it. Boy, was I dissapointed!!!! There was nothing about this album that impressed me. Where were the riffs??? Where were the screaching guitar solos? Where? <BR>    I can understand any band growing up a little. But Metallica has so totally sold out at this time that they are not worth paying any attention to anymore. They look more like GQ models than musicians and getting rid of Jason was the dumbest thing they have done in years. They have become exactly what they claimed to dispise. They only prove that just about every person has a price. And when you get offered millions of dollars to soften up you image and sound its hard to resist.
0060001941|5.0|A friend of mine once said, &quot;A classic is a book which has never finished saying what is has to.&quot;  This book is definitely a classic, one that I will read every year I'm sure.<br />&quot;Serene was a word you could put to Brooklyn, New York.&quot;  If that opening line doesn't hook you in, keep reading.  With each word, sentence, phrase...it just keeps getting better.  Smith writes beautifully, her words magically making something out of the life of a child who could have been a nobody.  This story is moving and beautiful-a must read for anyone who loves books and an inspirational story.<br />The story follows the life of little Francie Nolan, poor child of a penniless singer-waiter-drunkard Johnny, and hardworking-penny pincher-beautiful Katie.  Francie is a smart child who loves to read.  Her life is by turns happy, sad, melancholy and poignant.  With parents determined to see her and her brother Neeley to do better in life than they did, she moves through school and into the working life of her teens.  Her life is never easy, but one of her best characteristics is her ability to find beauty is the smallest things.  One of my favorite examples of this is, upon a visit to the old, shabby library, she sees in a plain brown bowl &quot;...nasturtiums!  Red, yellow, gold, and ivory-white.  A head pain caught her between the eyes at the taking in of such a wonderful sigh.  It was something to be remembered all her life. (page, 21-chapter 2).&quot;<br />I laughed, cried and cheered with this tiny child, desperate to make something of herself and find love.  Smith gives the lives of these poor, desperate, sometimes even starving people a measure of pride and beauty that is unforgettable.
B00004U2NX|5.0|With the exception of the television show Dark Shadows, George A. Romero's &quot;Martin&quot;, and Tobe Hooper's &quot;Salem's Lot: The Mini-series&quot;, I'm not a fan of vampire-related entertainment--especially where Count Dracula is concerned. However, Werner Herzog's 1979 film, &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, is, in my opinion, the best vampire film ever made, next to the 1922 original &quot;Nosferatu&quot;.<br />Herzog's &quot;Nosferatu&quot; evokes strong images, feelings, and moods in a subtle, but stirring way. There's no glitz, no glamour, or romanticism. The film is eerie, ugly, beautiful, strongly visual, at times scary, and always completely compelling. &quot;Noseferatu&quot; is a film that displays film artistry, but not film &quot;artsiness&quot;. Well acted, well scored, well directed, and great cinematography, &quot;Nosferatu&quot; captures the true spirit of the myth known as the Vampyre
B00003CXTG|1.0|I am SO OFFENDED by commercials marketing this movie that capitalise on the sense of patriotism since Sept 11. How dare Hollywood use real tragedy to boost sales? They are playing on the public's feelings of loss, mourning and love of country. For shame!<br />Had it been a worthwhile movie about Pearl Harbor, perhaps I wouldn't be so offended, but this is big-budget self-indulgence, not well-crafted drama.
0195067142|5.0|My children always mocked me for refusing to buy a Japanese car.  If they would read this book they might understand why an old Marine might feel this way.
B00005J6T1|5.0|When I was just eighteen years old in 1983, there was this tune that kept on playing in my mind.  That song was &quot;Holiday.&quot;  I never knew the artist then, but when &quot;Borderline&quot; was released in 1984, I became a great fan of Madonna, who was not a superstar yet during that time.  Her first album, originally released in analog recording, contained nine tracks which for me are all great. Now, 18 years later and now 36 years old, the original Madonna album had been remastered!  I immediately bought the copy and listened to the difference.  Much as the bonus tracks really dont mean anyhting to me (since I have all her cd singles!), the remastering brought out the best instruments in &quot;Burning Up&quot; and the bass of &quot;Lucky Star.&quot;<br />All the tracks have been wonderfully remastered.  &quot;Holiday&quot; still have the beat and splendor as it did 18 years ago.  &quot;Physical Attraction&quot; was simply one of the best, and &quot;Everybody,&quot; her first single, featured in all its glorious six minutes, gave not one clue that Madonna would be the icon of pop music!  Other tracks were simply great: &quot;I Know It&quot; and &quot;Think of Me&quot; featured the girl in Madonna.<br />Every saga has a beginning, and despite all the bootleg releases of her supposedly &quot;early tracks&quot; this album from WB/Sire is really one of her greatest albums - no pretentions, no hype, just great music!<br />No wonder, you can play it side by side with her recent albums, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and &quot;Music&quot; and notice only one thing: their greatness!  Madonna is one of the best artists of all time and these albums are just testaments to her creativity and artistry.<br />With also &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and &quot;True Blue&quot; being digitally remastered, i hope &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; &quot;Who's That Girl&quot; &quot;You Can Dance&quot; &quot;I'm Breathless&quot; and even &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; will receive the same royal treatment in the future.  The albums of the 90's need no remastering - they all sound great already (content and otherwise!)
B00000DFRS|5.0|I find it funny that people here complain about the fact that this album doesn't have the dance remixes, and then you go to the reviews of her greatest hits (US version) and people are complaining over there that it does have the dance remixes.  Kind of ridiculous.  People complained to Arista when they bought this album that they didn't have the fast versions they loved, so Arista listened to them and put the remixes on her greatest hits, then people complained that they don't want the remixes.  WHATEVER!! LOL.   Anyways, I'm happy with both albums.<br />This is a great album, it's very R&amp;B, much more soulful then any of her other albums (except the Preacher's Wife soundtrack which was mainly gospel).  Back in the 80's and early 90's she used to sing more pop songs &amp; power ballads, but this album is more deep and more soulful.  She really succeeded in staying relevant over the years.  IMO, if you love great R&amp;B music, then this cd will become one of your all-time favourites.  If you want the dance remixes that you heard on the radio, then either buy the singles or the US version of her greatest hits (because the international has the original versions of the songs).  My favourite song on this album is the incredible ballad I Learned From The Best, what a voice!
B000002U82|5.0|This album, to me and many others, represents the broad spectrum of life itself.  An earlier review I read complained about how the lyrics are full of self-pity, but I believe the meaning of the lyrics are the complete opposite.  They're not talking about just themselves!  A personal favourite song of mine is &quot;Us and Them&quot; because the mood of the song transforms from a slow, jazzy, almost distant feel to a loud, majestic warm chorus. Buy this album.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This DVD is a MUST see! Sit down and enjoy this gang of escaped prisoners flee. See a cow on a roof top, The Muddy Water Boys, and much more! This movie is HILARIOUS!!

6305841861|5.0|As Ash proves yet again that he hasn't any qualm's about buzzing his inhabited friends down to size, he proves this time that you can nearly re-tell a story and not loose a thing. Actually in 2, Ash pulls from his past encounter's to show off his new sarcasm. If you didn't like the straight forward horror of the first, then this is for you. I have watched this movie many times in the past two years, and laugh every time! When Ash has taken out the enemy, and you think the battle is over, he turns on himself...more specifically his hand. In an effort to save himself from the spreading incantation, he whacks off his arm in a humorous and bloody fashion. This movie is my favorite of all ultra-violent comedies, and not for the faint of heart, but if you pulled the first one out of your player because your stomach couldn't take it (as my friends have made me do the last three times)(I forgave them, Evil Dead has been rightly dubbed NC-17, when I was expecting X) then maybe you will like this one. Ash is cool and bad to the goo, I mean bone.
B000003S0D|5.0|(...)<br />Cirkus-Is a haunting, and lyrically enchanting song. This song really likes to be a little frightening, with it's mood changes and all. I'd have to say that King Crimson is among the best at mood changing songs (The best, of course, being Queen). There is also an absolutely beutiful jazz takeover towards the 2 minute marker, this then quickly changes back to a haunting nigh symphonic ballad. <br />Indoor games- Is my favorite song on the album. I know that the die-hard KC fans are cursing me, my family, and the grave which I shall soon rest in if they have their way, but this is absolutely fantastic. The Jazz tones, wonderful singing, and fitting folk guitar strums all make one gratifying, and perfect song. Don't get me wrong I am a huge fan of KC, and my obligitory favorite is &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King&quot;, but one cannot surpass the musical greatness that is reached on this song. The only KC songs i can think of that surpass this are 'ITCOTKC' and '21st Century Schitzoid Man'. Let us not forget they 'Hey ho' and maniac laughing at the end. <br />Happy Family-I like it, but it does sound like he swallowed an aphrodisiac. Deffinately frantic, almost like Captain Beefheart. <br />Lady Of The Dancing Water-Is absolutely beutiful, and my only regret is that it is not longer. The singing and flute playing are timeless gems of perfection. I have to say, that it soothes me when I listen to it. Perfect relaxing song, like 'I Talk To The Wind'. Another reason why this album is one of their best. <br />Lizard (and all its kin)- It is a little too long, but is deffinatley an epic. Like Pink Floyd's 'Atom Heart Mother'and 'Echoes', it is a twenty three minute epic. Like many of the greatest songs of the seventies, this tells a fantastic story of prince Rupert and the oncoming war. A wonderful listen if you have the time. This caps of the list of wonderful music that makes &quot;LIZARD&quot; a must-have for any KC fan, or anyone who likes music in general. <br />I'd like to take a breif moment to talk about the album cover, booklette, and unique LP-like packaging. The album cover and artwork are magnificent, and some of the best ever. The booklette is really a scrapbook of interesting tidbits about KC and the album (nicely done). Now we come to my favorite part, the LP packaging. This is really neat. I'm only thirteen (Suprised?), but I really wish I had a record player, and a collection of LP's like my mother. This is probably as close as I am going to get. My father has some LP's but they're all Elvis (I hate him so much, Elvs that is...not my Dad), so I know that they actualy looked like that (with the black (or white) paper CD holder that slips into the Cardboard case etc.). I got the record Player!-December 24 <br />So I leave you with these words, &quot;Buy it!&quot; Even if it was $100 it would be a must buy. Do not pass this one up. You'll be sorry if you do. <br />Also if you like KC you'll probably like Captain Beefheart, I really recomend 'Trout Mask Replica', it's the greatest album ever recorded by the greatest band ever. Thank you for reading my review.
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles knew they were about to part ways, you can see such in the &quot;Let It Be&quot; film. But at some point, they got together and made the best album ever. The guitar work is tremendous throughout. Is Ringo a &quot;real&quot; rock and roll drummer? It is proved here. Harrison's &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; are, in my opinion, 2 of the most beautiful ever written. The opera-like &quot;You Never Give Your Money&quot; medly is quite a musical work. Who else but The Beatles could write a song about a killer (Maxwell's Silver Hammer) and make it hummable and humorous. Younger hard rock fans will enjoy the guitar licks. This was the last from The Beatles and they made sure it was the best. I love the close, &quot;and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make&quot;. This is indeed a masterpiece
B00005B4GU|5.0|In a music scene where techno(...)and electronica are considered by many to be \\"mindblowing\\", Radiohead are an intelligent band with much more...lyrics and vocals. Personally,<BR>the cold, futuristic, and bizarre just for the sake of being bizarre techno just doesn't cut it.  Just boring sounds that some consider music.  However, Radiohead are something different...talent.  The only song on this album I dislike is \\"Pulk/Pull revolving doors\\". Also, I love the lyrics, with the exception of \\"dollars and cents\\"  because it is anti-capitalist, and personally I like capitalism.  My favourite songs are ranked from fav to least fav: track 4, track 2, track 11, track 6, track 5, track 1, track 7, track 10 track 8, track 9, track 3.

0385505833|5.0|Grisham assumes the role of the Grinch in this ever so delightful, very tongue in cheek little book. Before I finished the first chapter I was snickering and giggling, and I continued to do straight through to the end - and then I started it over again.  An exceedingly fun bit of writing, you'll not only recognize some of the characters (caricatures?) - you might even see yourself.  After The Kranks on Hemlock Lane determine they will just skip Christmas this year and go on a cruise on Christmas Day instead, they find themselves hiding behind the blinds, in the shower, or in the basement of their own home.  Not only will they forgo the \\"burning away their paychecks\\" at the mall, the \\"mindless materialism of our culture,\\" and the Christmas parties but they also (gasp!) decline to decorate.  On Hemlock Lane, the 7' tall rooftop Frostys (\\"made to glow by a 200 watt bulb screwed into a cavity somewhere near Frosty's colon\\") announce the season from the rooftop of every home. But one.  The tension builds as anonymous Frosty cards start arriving and the \\"coerced bribery\\" of the benevolent associations nearly brings them to their knees.  The ending takes a twist, that I'll leave for you to find out on your own.<br />If this clever little book appeals to you, let me also recommend M.C. Beaton's A HIGHLAND CHRISTMAS and Maeve Binchy's THIS YEAR IT WILL BE DIFFERENT.  Seriously humorous satires that I have also thoroughly enjoyed.
B00005QXXO|5.0|If you went to any Radiohead shows this summer then you know what my title means.  If you missed out, then you can get a taste of what Radiohead is like in concert by taking this CD, getting some huge, very expensive speakers, turning it up to ear deafening levels (but to the point where it is loud and it surrounds you but actually causes you no pain)and just relaxing and you'll get the same effect as the concerts this summer.  Obviously, nothing will replace those experiences, however, this is definitely not a bad alternative.
B00004Z311|5.0|Although I haven't seen the DVD version yet, I have rented the VHS version several times &amp; can't to add the DVD to my collection! This movie is a great fantasy flick &amp; I would recommend it to fans of J.R.R. Tolkien (Lord of the Rings), C.S. Lewis (The Lion, Witch &amp; the Wardrobe), the Dark Crystal, &amp; even Star Wars (although it is not a space-fantasy movie}. Tim Curry as a satan-like character is quite convincing (cool costume, makeup &amp; a pitch-bent voice). Dark, charming &amp; wicked, he seeks to take control by possessing the horn of the unicorn which apparently represents the good in the world. He obtains the female's horn but does not yet have full power until he can get the male's as well. He also ends up being enchanted with the lead female who is Tom Cruise's love in the movie. Add some goblins, a hideous witch, and a mischevious fairy to the mix &amp; you've got a classic fantasy story that all fans of the genre can enjoy. Granted, it's not Oscar winning acting or even deep writing, but entertaining? You betcha, and if you like to sit down every now &amp; then &amp; enjoy a good film with great imaginative characters and down't want to have to sit through another elite Hollywood dramafest for 3 hours, get this DVD. It's a wonderful film that will keep you interested &amp; when you're done watching it you'll be glad you bought it.
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|I went into this movie expecting it to be a waste of three hours, I came out stunned.  With many comparisons being made to Titanic, this film far surpasses its extremely overrated predecessor.  The movie's love story is far better than the cliche ridden schlock of Titanic.  The care free relationship of Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale was reminiscent of the attitude in the time preceding December 7th, and then that of Josh Hartnett and Beckinsale just added more to the Drama of Hartnett's and Affleck's friendship and than added a bit during the battle and aftermath as well.  <BR>Onto the attack scene of Pearl Harbor, quite simply put, wow.  The drama and intensity rivals that of the opening scene in Saving Private Ryan.  Anyone who writes it off as simple special effects is incorrect.  The attack scene perfectly depicts the confusion and the horrors one would imagine happened that early morning December 7th despite minor inaccuracies.<BR>In conclusion, the movie may not be oscar caliber, but it was certainly very well made.  The attack scene is one of the most spectacularily put together war scenes in film history and the romance certainly didn't hurt the film.  If you haven't seen the movie yet I highly recommend you rent it.
B00005214X|5.0|This was undeniably George's greatest solo release, where he opened the creative floodgates after years of being limited to about one song per side of the Beatles' LP's.  He would not even come close to releasing something this good until the 'Cloud Nine' LP, which was more of a pleasant surprise, and his stuff with the Traveling Wilburys.  My quibble with this new reissue is that it should have included the four sides from the original LP (cuts 1-9 on Disc 1 and cuts 1-9 on Disc 2) on the first disc, instead of splitting them up.  That way the integrity of the original release is preserved.  Then the second disc could have featured the &quot;Apple Jam&quot; recordings (cuts 10-14 on Disc 2) along with the new bonus tracks from Disc 1.  There then could have been room on Disc 2 for the studio recording of &quot;Bangla-desh&quot; (which is only available on 'The Best of George Harrison' release from 1976) and the excellent B-side &quot;Deep Blue&quot;, which is not available on CD.  Would have made a great release even better, and a fitting tribute to George now that he's gone.
B000002TQV|4.0|I confess...I got into Radiohead late, circa &quot;OK Computer,&quot; but became an instant fan.  &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Bends&quot; are their strongest albums, in my estimation, and &quot;Bends&quot; finds the boys doing what they do best...blending the distinctive, melodic Brit Pop sound with nasty, highly-produced guitar rock.  This album boasts beautiful songs like &quot;Bulletproof&quot; and &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; as well as songs &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; and &quot;Bones&quot; that will get you speeding tickets.  Don't be bullied by musical elitists into thinking that you have to like &quot;Amenisiac&quot; and &quot;Kid A&quot; if you want to count.  It's true that Radiohead's strength lies in their willingness to shun the mainstream and break new musical ground, but you'll find them doing that on &quot;The Bends&quot;...and you'll have an CD that will stay in your rotation a lot longer.
0385421982|5.0|The novel all takes place in 3 locations. Washsington D.C., Louisiana, and New Orleans. The main character, Darby Shaw, who is a student at a law school, wittnesses the murder of 2 cheif justices. Abraham Rosenberg, and Glenn Jensen. The assasin was Khamel, and international terrorist. But the people who hired for him to kill the cheif justices plan to kill Darby Shaw for wittnessing the crime. They almost succeded when they planted the bomb in her car. The car exploded but she wasn't in it. Now Darby can't turst anyone, except a Washington D.C. news reporter named Gray Grantham.<br /> This book is really a keeper. Normally, with other books that are this long I would just fall asleep, give up, or just read the book but not pay attention to what I'm reading. Every time when i had finish a chapter, I had a sudden urge to read the next one. The novel leaves pondering what will happen next? This book was also put on the big screen as well. I gave this nove; a 5 because, well whats their to say? It was simply a great book. Ihad enjoyed reading it as well.
B00000DHR0|5.0|This is a Christmas season in a stressful world, and singers such as Celine provide us with some of the feelings we need.  The title song by Diane Warren fits both Celine and these times perfectly.  &quot;The Prayer&quot; again is meaningful for right now.  Of the more familiar songs, Celine's &quot;Ave Maria&quot; is beautiful.  The rendition of &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; is surprisingly tender and feeling.  Most of the songs are sung very feelingly, although she does let loose with the volume on a couple of the first tracks.  Very highly recommended.
0517123207|1.0|To illustrate what's wrong with this book, I below lift out the central hypothesis which is the theory of Natural Selection.<br />&quot; can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection.&quot; <br />The fact is that *all* individuals do not survive, all individuals die. Such exactness is important in science and Darwin fails this scientific standard. This seemingly insignificant error in the fundament of the theory gives a cascade of errors later on. It is really quite different to say that the chance of reproduction determines which organisms are left in the world, then to say a struggle for survival/existence determines it. The first puts focus on the individual organism (since they reproduce, but don't survive), the last puts focus on the population (which doesn't reproduce much, but can be said to survive).  <BR>Throughout the book there is no effort at formalization, which is why Physicists, Chemists etc. people of the socalled hard sciences(up until the 19!80's when physicists also started to make their science softer because of the problems they ran into), looked down on Darwinism as a soft science employing a magical struggle for existence and intuitive terms like that. <br />It is clear that Darwin, having dropped Christianity, invested as much emotion into his theory as he could, making it a suitable substitute religion for him, rather then try to make it a hard science. <br />&quot;Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal andmental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection.&quot;<br />The natural force of goodness? For crying out loud. This should have read something like: and as natural selection works by the chance of reproduction of each organism, all corpereal endowments normally contribute towards reproduction. <br />The security of humanity depends on politics much. Certainly humanity is capable of killing themselves entirely, what with superweapons like the earth slicer, or some biological weapon, or destroying the ozoneshield, or stopping the oceanic pump etc. :( It is not good for Darwin to ignore politics as an active agency in favour of some biological determinism. This is something he also does in the Descent of Man in a *much* more creepy way when talking about the extermination of one race by another. There really is much better work done in biology in the same era, this is not up to scratch.
B000001FA4|5.0|This album is truly amazing.  Somewhere in the middle of what proves to be U2's last punk-protest studio album (&quot;War&quot;) and the fully mature &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; lies the etherial &quot;Unforgettable Fire,&quot; an album unique in the U2 cannon and in rock history.  Here is an album that finds Bono and the Boys with producers Lanois and Eno, free to experiment, not yet under the pressure of being the greatest band in the world, riding on sheer passion, brilliance, and dreamlike ambient sounds.  Here is the anthemic &quot;Pride,&quot; the blistering &quot;Wire,&quot; the enigmatic and astounding &quot;Bad,&quot; as well as little-known gems like the much maligned &quot;Elvis Presley and America&quot; (absolutely unearthly) and the hauntingly beautiful &quot;Promenade,&quot; made all the more touching by it's brevity.  U2 has since produced more even albums with a more established sound, without compromising their artistic integrity...but they have not brought us another as bold and fresh as &quot;The Unforgettable Fire.&quot;
0385505833|5.0|This was a terrific book, read easily in a day or so.  Simple, easy to read, easy to imagine and picture.  Fun story line, terrific with holiday season soon in swing.  Very funny!!  As I was reading, I didn't want to put it down!  John Grisham is an excellent writer and it shows he can write about more than just lawyers!  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the holidays and it looking for a simple novel to lighten their mood.  Good luck!
6303471714|5.0|I purchased this video when it came out almost 10 years ago and I still love it to this day.  It is the best exercise video I've ever found to give you fast results and a very challenging workout!  I have done a lot of workouts in the past 10 years, from aerobics classes to physical fitness training I received in the military, but nothing has been more beneficial for me than this video. <BR>I don't understand the editor's comments which say this video is so dangerous.  In all the years I have been using this video, I have never received any injuries from it.  When my mother, who is 53, comes to visit me we do this video together and she has never had any problems with it either.  I do find that some of the stomach exercises are too fast so I usually pause the tape to give myself time to do them slowly and properly.  You will be very sore the next day, but if you're careful, as with any exercise program, you should be fine.  As for it not being effective, I would like to show that person the results I've had this workout!  It might change their mind!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|A wild ride of a movie, done is a calm methodical way.<br />The main character &quot;Guy Pierce&quot; was injured when somebody broke into his house, raped and murdered his wife.  He now has a condition that gives him no short term memory. He will forget a face after a minute. cannot watch TV. because he will not remember the begining of the show when it finally ends, nor when on the phone will he remember who he is talking to.  However he remembers everything up to the time his wife was killed.  That is what fuels his life, he wants to find her killer.<br />He gets through the smaller things in his life by looking at polaroids labled &quot;My Car&quot; or with peoples names.  the more important things in his life he tatoos on himself.<br />All of this can make for a thrilling suspensefull movie as when one scene begins with him on the phone, he, while talking is slowly pulling off a bandage from a new tatoo, as the bandage comes off the words &quot;Do NOT answer the phone&quot; are revealed. Then he asks, &quot;Who is this?&quot; and the other line goes dead.<br />This is just an example of what you are in for.  For an added thrill the movie shows scenes from the most recent back to the begining so in a way you are like the main character, you don't know what went on before.  Highly recomended.
B000002NAK|5.0|Okay, first things first:  I'm a Madonna fan.  I looked forward to this CD for months and waited breathlessly for the movie.  Whether you love her or hate her (and most everyone falls into one category or another), you have to admit, the woman does what she has to do to stay on top, and she is capable of doing just about anything.//&quot;Evita&quot; is not one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's masterworks.  It's long, it's often dull, and it needs a certain &quot;something&quot; to keep the audience interested.  Enter Madonna with some of the most accomplished singing of her career.  On this CD, she sings with some of the lightweight vocals that dominated her early CDs, but she also introduces the deeper, more impressive vocal range that ultimately opened the door to her later CDs and subsequent critical acceptance.  Antonio Banderas, Jimmy Nail, and Jonathan Pryce contribute very respectable vocals, but at the end of the day, this is Madonna's show.//Her interpretation of &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot; is fantastic.  Her husky vocals in &quot;A New Argentina&quot; dominate the track and communicate the urgency of the character's plight at that point in the story.  She attacks &quot;Buenos Aires&quot; as if it were one of her own classic dance tracks.  And her performance on the new &quot;You Must Love Me&quot; is both tender and commanding.  Yes, Madonna keeps her promise; she delivers on the &quot;Evita&quot; soundtrack, and she delivers in spades.
1558908455|5.0|This is probably my favorite movie ever (based on how many times I've seen it), the cast is great and the story line is very good. It gets a little corny in the second part (fighting vampires and all) but overall impression of the whole movie after you see it is just GREAT !!
0380002930|2.0|My family found this book for me at a yard sale for 10 cents. they all told me it was a great book, even my mom, who rarely reads anything but Black Stallion books and Romance novels. I tried to read it, but I just couldnt stomach it, the plot seemed ok, but I couldnt get into it. From what I read.. the bunnies were talking to eachother, which is fine with me, I can deal with that, but I just couldnt get into it.
630339406X|4.0|This film is great fun but with a serious message. While telling the fantasy story about a boy who grows from twelve to thirty overnight it also tells us something about the problems we all experience over a few years while growing up. It's also a satire of the ridiculous corporate system that operates in large companies where employees are appointed 'Vice Presidents' and have a 'Xerox room'. Hanks is well-cast in the main role, bringing just the right balance of humour and pathos. I shudder to think what would have happened if Robin Williams had got hold of the same material. The highlight of the film is where Hanks and his boss dance on a giant set of piano keys playing jolly tunes.
B00001NFCY|4.0|This album is nowhere as good as My Own Prison, but in many ways it's not bad. this album represents both the extrememly good and the extremely bad about Creed, with the good winning out most of the time. They have some really good tracks here, ( Higher, With Arms Wide Open, What If?) and some really bad ones ( Say I, Faceless man) bt the factr is that it's good for the most part and the sophmore jinx didn't hit them too bad, their 3rd albim Weathered is better, more in the way of MOP, but this deisc is pretty good.
B000002KCI|5.0|Neil Young has made so many records over the years that one may lose count. Some of them are better off forgotten(not many). But then there are those that sound as great today as when they first came out. Neil has made some great songs over the years but &quot;Cortez The Killer&quot; ranks as one of his very best. The album has a whole has no weak tracks and will grab hold of you like his earlier stuff.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Those who approach &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; as a war film will be disappointed.  It is not about WWII, and it is not meant to convey all of the atrocities and horrors of the Holocaust in detail.  Those are things that have been done very well by others.  This is not Schindler's List!<br />What it IS (and what makes it so beatiful) is the story of a man's love for his wife and son, and the lengths to which he will go to protect them in the face of unspeakable evil.  Time after time Roberto Benigni's character chances death in order to provide his wife with a fleeting moment of comfort, or in order to protect the fragile sensibilities of his young son.  <br />The central message here is one of love and self-sacrifice, and it would not have been better served with more severe depictions of concentration camp life...besides, the inclusion of a shot of a mountain of dead bodies is quite enough (even if Benigni had the good taste to keep it relatively hazy, so that children could still see this film), not to mention the fate of Benigni's own character.<br />This is the sort of film that we see far too few of these days...a film that glorifies love, family and human dignity.  Lets hope it starts some sort of trend.
B000002KIE|4.0|THE SEX PISTOLS commited a kind of hara-khiri, when they replaced their bass player, Matlock, by the terrible player and heroin addict, Sid Vicious. The band lost all stability it could have achieved, because, behind all the fuss about their behavior, the songs here show really good punk music, played with confidence and ability. Vicious destroyed himself and, on the way, the band. A shame.
0451169514|5.0|although i have a few king books i love pretty much equally - The Shining, It, Pet Sematary, Salem's Lot and The Dead Zone - this one would probably get the title of His Masterpiece (forget The Stand).<br />this book, like the Tommyknockers, is a bit ungainly - maybe 850 pages would have been better than 1050 - and its time jumps are sometimes a bit hard to follow.  other than these small concerns, this book is pretty much flawless.  king writes like a man possessed, from the 0-to-60-in-ten-pages beginning to the simple hope and joy of the ending.  after setting the story's tone with two of It's attacks, he lets all seven of the characters introduce themselves as adults and then as kids - ben, stuttering bill, mike, eddie, bev, richie and stan are complicated, incredibly well-drawn people, seeming to come alive on the page.  for the middle of the book, we are largely in the characters' childhoods; king is excellent at conveying the wonder and overpowering emotions of that age, and these scenes are marginally stronger than the same characters once grown.  but that's a small complaint - his dialogue and grasp of understatement is still powerful.<br />and of course, It itself - aka, Pennywise the Clown, aka Bob Gray - is one of king's very best antagonists.  this ancient evil (seeming to hark from the dark dimension that king explores in The Dark Tower) comes as a giant bird, the creature from the black lagoon, a teenage werewolf, an old woman, and of course most famously as a clown resembling Bozo and Ronald McDonald.  sure, it sounds hokey - but so did the killer car in Christine.  king's lovely but muscular prose style and knack for page-turning suspense keeps us glued to the novel.<br />there are so many powerful scenes, and classic archetypes explored, that it's pointless to list them.  in spite of the book's almost primal story, it's rarely predictable, and still a pain to summarize (watch me try).  king knows how to tell a wonderful parallel story, and at the same time leave us with the brooding form of Derry, It's home, whose heart is dark and frightening.<br />this is certainly not a good king book to start with - i started with Salem's Lot - but is amazing for king fans, and ought to impress even the skeptical.  take a look!
0380733358|4.0|Eye of the Needle<BR>By: Ken Follet<BR> This is an action packed novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout parts of the book.  You watch as Nazi spy Henry Faber attempts to discover the American plan of invasion.  He discovers their secret and photographs evidence.  He must relay this vital information back to the Nazis so that they can prepare a defense.  If he gets through, the war is almost certain to be over for the United States.  Faber must lie, evade, and murder his way to the rendezvous, a German U-boat.  MI5, Scotland Yard, and other police and government agencies are called upon to find and stop him.  Faber steals a boat and attempts to sail away in a violent storm.  He is shipwrecked on a tiny island where there are four inhabitants; a cripple, an old man, a woman, and a child.  Faber is half dead, but surprised at his luck.  He later kills the cripple and old man and has an affair with the woman.  The woman discovers the murders and radios for help.  She is given distinct instructions; don't let him talk to the boat.  He attempts to radio the U-boat, but is unsuccessful due to the woman.  He then makes a mad dash to escape, followed by the woman.  She is determined not to let him get away, as she was told not to.  The fate of the entire Ally invasion rests in her hands.<BR> I enjoyed Eye of the Needle very much.  It is a well-written World War two novel.  It gave me a better understanding of how we deceived the Germans.  Ken Follet has a real gift for writing about espionage, and this book is no exception.  The book is not slow, but can be a little confusing at times.  In my opinion, two thumbs up for Ken Follet and Eye of the Needle.<br />Written by: Mike from Madison
B00005NGSE|5.0|Rudolf Schenker,Klaus Meine,Francis Buchholz,Herman Rarebell,Ulrich Roth (I think we have to call him Uli Jon Roth now?)Come together to make a good band Great!! This is the combanation that smoke's. And TOKYO TAPES is the proof! As I've looked  years for this cd, because the lp is so warn out you can see through it,lol. My good friends at Amazon.com came up with it, at a great price to boot. The sound is killer!! Problem? well, they edited out POLAR NIGHTS? &quot;Polar Nights, the original track #4, has been left off because of the limited lengths of this CD and is now to be found as bonus track on the re-issued Scorpions album TAKEN BY FORCE.&quot; (This is the EMI Version) Can you believe this?! The Elvis stuff could have been left off, as far as I care,lol. BUT!! No one track make's or break's this killer of a live cd!! So ten thumbs up for a band that helped us get through that garbage called disco in the late 70's. Does go good with Mahogany Rush's Live and U F O's Strangers... CD's. Another great gift for the guitar fan in your life!!

B00002E224|1.0|Not one frame of this turgid romance/travelogue is remotely believable.  The pacing is insultingly plodding.  Our luststruck couple pose before the unusual tourist attractions.  And the French girl recites standard trevel guide blurbs in every case.  In every case these pat travel guide spiels are much less painful than the utterly unbelievable claptrap that passes for romantic banter.  In one case the boy pantomimes calling home to tell his parents about the girl.  After this interminable and unendurable monologue, he requires her to do the same.<br />  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
0385505833|4.0|A nice funny little book, great for a gift. I enjoyed reading it, although the end was a little much..
B00005OM4N|3.0|Britney is a good album... there are some great songs like &quot;Slave 4 U&quot;, &quot;Overprotected&quot; &quot;Cinderella&quot; (both written by Max Martin), &quot;Not a girl not yet a woman&quot; (written by max martin &amp; Dido) or &quot;Boys&quot;.   You will also listen to cover of the oldie &quot;I love rock and roll&quot; wich is not so good and Justin Timberlake's voice in the last track which was written by him and Wade Robson (Britney's and N'sync coreographer, both wrote N'sync's hit &quot;POP&quot;).<BR>&quot;Britney&quot; is good, but could have been better, if you are expecting to find more songs like &quot;Slave 4 U&quot;, you won't...Britney's 3rd album is pure POP.
B000001EXR|5.0|When I saw Kiss perform in 1995 in Burbank at the Hilton on their convention tour, I remember Paul promised the crowd, &quot;Our next album will blow away Revenge&quot;. I remember having my doubts, but it certainly does. This is one of the best Kiss albums without a doubt. It's right up there with &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;, &quot;Destroyer&quot; and their debut release. The songs are heavy, heavy, HEAVY. Interesting to note that they went from doing an &quot;Unplugged&quot; tour to recording their heaviest METAL album ever. Paul Stanley shines on songs like &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;Jungle&quot;. Bruce Kulick even gets to sing lead vocals for once on a very strange but satisfying closing track. The drum tracks are a real delight as well. This is the best drum work ever recorded on a Kiss release. The only sad thing is Kiss of course went back to the original line up just when they were becoming real artists. Oh well, there were dolls, toys, comic books, lunchboxes and other junk to be sold and that's what the fans wanted. You can't blame them for &quot;selling out&quot; all over again. With a great gimmick like theirs, who wouldn't?! But I only hope that they make music like this again and bring back Eric Singer and Bruce Kulick.
B00003CXXJ|2.0|In Antarctica today we experienced the life and times of a frozen solid chicken. The chicken seemed to be having a hard time breathing because of unknown reasons. It also seemed to have a serious case of dandriff because of the flakes of skin that flew ofF when we accindentally slipped when cutting the ice from around him. The Antarctic weather must have been hard on him because when we finally got him free from the ice, he was in very small chunks.
B00004KD1L|5.0|I remember listening to interminable trombone solos from Andy when we were children at school in Yorkshire, England. At the river has to be one of the most mellow songs of recent times, with a wonderfully floaty trombone solo. What I want to know is did you play that Andy or was it sampled?
B00003CXTG|2.0|I went to this film on the very first day it came out it the hopes of a grand experience.  When I entered the theater I met up with a friend of mine that had just seen it.  When I mentioned I was there to see it as well; he simply told me, \\"Pearl Harbor is like have a three hour colonoscopy without any pain medication.\\"  To say the least he was right.  What ensued was a great 50 minute war film mixed with a sad, tired, boring, predictable, poorly acted,(did I say predictable?) love story.  I am generally a fan of Ben Affleck but this time around I would be ashamed to say I was.  Through out the whole film he looked like he was reading his lines off of a teleprompter like in a bad soap opera.  In fact the whole love story was like one.  And my god Kate Beckinsale was awful, and don't get me started on Josh Hartnett.  This film was so much like Titanic it made me sad to see it.  The ONLY good thing to come out of this movie was the war scenes that looked breathtakingly good.  But to make things worse there are going to be no less than two DVD versions coming out!  One is even a directors cut! Let's hope that that version is at least an hour shorter.  The price that most stores are attaching to it is only worth the actual bombing scene and the original teaser trailer.  In case you haven't noticed I am not a fan.  But don't listen to me if you like the movie chances are you and I wont agree.  This review is just me spouting off my disappointment for what could have been a good film.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I have long been a fan of country music and traditional rhythm and blues. However, I have had very mixed feelings about current trends (I think Faith Hill and Shania Twain are good pop singers). When I saw how this soundtrack was outselling every other country album for the longest time, I knew I had to see what the fuss was about. Needless to say I can now see why!! Every song on here is a classic. I never grow tired of hearing &quot;You Are My Sunshine,&quot; &quot;Keep On The Sunny Side,&quot; &quot;O Death,&quot; and &quot;Angel Band,&quot; to name a few. I am sure that some may think this music is rather simplistic. However, it is straight from the heart, it is basic and genuine, etc. For me this album will be like that old, comfortable sweater we all have - I can wrap myself up in it any time and feel good. As a side note, I was also glad to see that Patty Loveless' latest album is along much the same lines as this album.
0140434259|5.0|\\"Sense and Sensiblity\\" is a masterpiece. It's greatness and universality, besides it's pure entertainment value, can be extolled all day long. So its very easy, when you are dealing with a masterpiece, to lean on clich&eacute;s to describe a work.<br /><br />But I don't want to do that. I will, however, tell you that for young romantics who believe in Mr. Right and long walks on the beach, this novel takes you through the breathtaking ride of falling, captively, into love and falling, quite willfully, out. Also, you vicariously experience the emotional stupor of coming out on the other side of such a relationship exhausted...and wiser. Also, if you're like me, you can wrestle with the tale of a woman who believes in the security of decisiveness. Her conflict is how to be sensible in an insensible world, and then, finally, how to reconcile the whimsicleness in herself. Where does the mind retreat and the heart take over?  \\"Sense and Sensiblity\\" lastly is a tale for sisters. A truly unique relationship, Jane Austen captures the complexity of sisters--persons, peers even, that are equipped with the same tools in life but that often are very different. And despite these differences, share an eternal bond that can only be severed by themselves. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is worth the time and money any day.
6302484391|4.0|According to the video, \\"How to Marry a Millionaire\\" was the first movie released in CinemaScope. CinemaScope is the super-long screen, and, since this movie was the first, you can tell they made ample use of the longer screen.<br />Well, at least you can GUESS that they did that. There are many, many scenes where you can tell that they did a shot of all three women - Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Lauren Bacall - sitting next to each other, but because of the pan & scan, you only get to see two of the three on your screen.<br />Bottom line: if you can find a Letterbox version, buy that instead. Otherwise, it's a cute little story.
B00005QXXO|2.0|ok.  they should NEVER have released this cd.  it's not that radiohead isn't good live...they are in fact simply AMAZING live...but their (live) talents cannot be captured in a mass produced cd.  it's just not possible.  why do I feel like they are being such sell outs?
B00000K3D4|5.0|&quot;Labyrinth&quot; is one of those very special fantasy films on a very short list, and most films on that list came out of the 1980s (&quot;Legend,&quot; &quot;Willow,&quot; etc.). And yet this adventure is unlike any other, coupled with its surrealism, the brilliant use of detailed puppets, and its somewhat intellectual, and quite hilarious, sense of humor. <br />The plot revolves around Sarah and her baby brother Toby, whom she repentantly summons into the realm of the goblins and their king, portrayed wonderfully by David Bowie (though I would rather he got rid of the tights). She then takes it upon herself to rescue him, and in the process unites with several very interesting companions. All of this is handled in a setting devoid of violence, and occasionally the characters WILL break into song. But make no mistake, this is not a movie only to be enjoyed by children (though they will certainly enjoy it, just as I did when I was a child). This is a movie for the entire family - and I dare say that adults may appreciate its depth and escapism even more. And though I've never been a fan of musicals (and this movie is a mild form of the musical), here I take exception. I even enjoy the music, what's more.<br />&quot;Labyrinth&quot; is a brilliant fantasy film, plain and simple.
0064471837|5.0|a very very good book-- slow reading in the beginning but definitely worth reading.
B00005RIKD|4.0|Sting had a real opportunity here.  There's always been a division between &quot;Police Sting&quot; and &quot;Solo Sting&quot;.  With &quot;All This Time&quot;, recorded just before his 50th birthday, he had a chance to reconcile both catalogs ... reinventing them into something more than either had been before.  <br />This CD is just a few creative decisions away from being astonishing.  The reinterpretation of &quot;Fragile&quot; takes a haunting song to an even more mature level.  &quot;A Thousand Years&quot; is wonderful, with a jazzier groove than it's previous incarnation ... but then is unfortunately cut short into a medley with &quot;Perfect Love Gone Wrong&quot;.  While both &quot;All This Time&quot; and &quot;If You Love Somebody&quot; share similar energies (possibly due to the fact that these arrangements were created over a two week period), they both have room to breathe and eventually land on different personalities.  &quot;Brand New Day&quot; takes on a bluesier vibe ... an interesting choice that works delightfully.  And the swing finale to &quot;Roxanne&quot; brought an instant smile to this reviewer's face.  <br />A disappointment is &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; ... Sting's unplugged version from 1991 has much more soul ... this version is little more than an acoustic interpretation from Sting's usual live set.  In addition, &quot;If I Ever Lose My Faith in You&quot; doesn't break any new ground ... especially in light of an inspired reading of &quot;Don't Stand So Close to Me&quot;, which shows just how haunting a good melody can be.  And kudos for cool surprises like &quot;When We Dance&quot; and &quot;The Hounds of Winter&quot;.  <br />A great CD to be sure ... but more imagination, along with the inclusion of &quot;Desert Rose&quot; and &quot;Mad About You&quot; (we saw them rehearsed on the A&amp;E special) would have made it quite possibly THE defining moment in Sting's work.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This album is awesome!  One of the best I've bought all year long.  How dare you people call Incubus's hard work garbage!  And all you 1-star raters, save those for Britney Spears and the Spice Girls.  If you were a real Incubus/music fan, you would appreciate all four albums (Fungus Amongus, S.C.I.E.N.C.E., Make Yourself, Morning View)for what they are and understand that during the recording of every album they felt different vibes and energies and capatalized on them.  Even if they are going pop to make more money, understand where they're coming from.  It's hard enough to make a living as it is.  If you're doing something you love (as they do), you might as well make all the money you can! It's so sad you people can't see that change is good.  Incubus is a band blessed with talent.  Why not try to stop hating and give credit where it's due?
B00003BDXG|1.0|Although I'm sure Oliver Stone's intentions were good in attempting to show the banality of media hype and desensitizing of society, NBK, in my opinion goes too far.  This movie is ruthless in its &quot;in your face&quot; attitude regarding violence.  Apparently Oliver Stone wanted to use shock tactics and this he accomplished.  No wonder society is in such an upheaval.  Mr. Stone did not help society with this unsavory offering, he merely added to its demise. Attempts at humor throughout the film are, possibly, meant to temper the violence, but sadly falls short.  I don't recommend this movie to anyone with healthy sensibilities.
0140143505|5.0|Before eMail, before chat rooms, and before &quot;Instant Messages&quot; there were letters. In this beautiful, true story, an outspoken New York writer and a rather more restrained London bookseller carry on an increasingly touching correspondence, via letters, for a period of 20 years. Most likely you will read this book in one sitting and use a few Kleenex on the way. You may get to the end, and read it again. In the collection's penultimate entry, Helene Hanff (the author) urges a tourist friend, &quot;If you happen to pass by 84, Charing Cross Road, kiss it for me. I owe it so much.
B00003CX5P|3.0|In theatres, George Lucas' &quot;Star Wars:  Episode I, The Phantom Menace&quot; (whew!) had one transcendent moment:  when the lights went down, the familiar fanfare blared, and the words &quot;Star Wars&quot; soared into deep space.  Then, like a spaceship with a hull breach, the air leaked out, and all life with it.  Trade embargos?  What th'?!!?  A space adventure epic that begins with an economics lesson?  I've got a bad feeling about this...<BR><br />Unfortunately, in this &quot;Star Wars,&quot; there's lots of energy but no drama.  An example?  R2-D2's intro, completely without verve or context; we're supposed to instantly get emotional simply because HEY LOOK- it's R2-D2, that cute li'l guy from the first trilogy, and he might get blown up!  But it isn't earned by what Lucas puts on the screen; rather, it lazily trades off our warm feelings for the earlier films.  Perhaps Lucas assumes the audience already adores the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe and all its merchandise, so he's free to cut corners.  Also, there's no climax to this moment.  The space queen merely &quot;commends&quot; R2 in another scene that's so static, so formal and emotionless, it might as well be performed entirely by kitchen appliances.  Okay, prepare yourself, because here comes the gratuitous anti-Jar-Jar section of the review... <BR><br />And then there's Mr. Binks, the recipient of many Internet death threats.  You know you're in trouble when the hardest workin' guy in your movie is the one everyone despises.  Obnoxious and omnipresent, Jar-Jar Binks ruins every scene he's in (about 90% of the movie).  I don't fault Ahmed Best; he actually performs quite well.  It's the role that stinks.  Sir Lawrence Olivier couldn't have played it!  Kids hate Jar-Jar, adults loathe him.  His action figures choke our landfills.  Jar-Jar.  Another cultural touchstone for a generation, albeit not in the manner Lucas intended.<BR><br />Double-J aside, everyone else seems only mildly engaged in the story.  Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan comes off best, but Liam Neeson is sour, and Natalie Portman seems ill at ease talking to CGI freaks and beeping trashcans.  In fact, she rarely seems to be talking with them, as much as at them.  As for poor Jake Lloyd, he's only as bad as everyone else.  Annoying little cuss, though, with his &quot;Yippee!&quot; and &quot;Are you an angel?&quot; cutesy lines.  And when you create such a visually impressive villian as horn-headed Darth Maul... he should actually DO SOMETHING IN THE MOVIE!<BR><br />Mainly, &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; proves set-pieces and ancillary marketing do not a movie make.  Knock out sequences such as the pod-race and the climactic battles are made to seem ridiculous due to childishness, and too much serendipity.  It's as if Lucas is better at imagining scenes than filming them, and better at directing robots and puppets than human beings.  Too bad... we may go to a movie to see the puppets, but learn to love it because of the characters.  Plus, why should we have to buy a lot of toys and books in order to fully appreciate what's onscreen?  Why can't the movie be self-contained, rather than the lynchpin of a marketing juggernaut?<BR><br />The DVD version overflows with info, documentaries and the like.  Extras include the &quot;Duel of Fates&quot; music video (the music's more compelling minus Mannequin Skywalker and the rest of the film), storyboards, animatics, deleted footage and commentary from Lucas and others involved.  If you're a &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan, or completist, you'll definitely want this stuff.  It's a lot more interesting than the movie, but has a desperate air about it.  It's Lucas begging us to love &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; because he and his imaginative elves worked so hard on it.  And bless their hearts, they really did!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I realy loved this movie and this soundtrack, but I'm a little confused.  I orginally bought the soundtrack at Sam Goody when the movie was still in theoters and my track list is different.  In my ablum the tracks follow the order of the movie.  Starting with Nature Boy done by Toulouses.  Is there two versions of this album?  What's going on?
0451524985|5.0|David Herbert Lawrence was born on 11th September 1885 in Nottinghamshire, England, little knowing that he would eventually have much in common with writers as varied as James Joyce and Aristopanes.<br />Ulysses by James Joyce was recently selected by the Modern Library as the best novel of the 20th century. Like Aristophanes' Lysistrata and Lawrence's 'Lady Chatterley', it was banned for decades from the U.S. mails under the Comstock Law of 1873. Officially known as the Federal Anti-Obscenity Act, this law banned the mailing of &quot;lewd&quot;, &quot;indecent&quot;, &quot;filthy&quot;, or &quot;obscene&quot; materials. The Comstock laws, while now to some extent unenforced, remain for the most part on the books today. The Telecommunications Reform Bill of 1996 even specifically applied some of these outdated and outmoded laws to computer networks.<br />So what's my message here? Simple - if we continue to allow censors to dictate what we can and cannot read, we stand the chance of being robbed of some of the world's finest written works. We're not talking exceptions here. Consider, for example John Cleland's Fanny Hill - Candide, Voltaire's critically hailed satire - Jean-Jacques Rousseau's autobiography Confessions - Chaucer's Canterbury Tales - Boccaccio's Decameron - Defoe's Moll Flanders, and various editions of The Arabian Nights. All were banned at various times in the US.<br />The 1928 Lady Chatterley's Lover is no longer distinguished for the once-shocking treatment of the adulterous affair between a sexually unfulfilled married woman and her husband's game keeper. Now that we're used to hearing and reading about sex, it's apparent that the novel is memorable for better reasons: namely, that Lawrence was a masterful writer whose wonderful story takes us bodily into the world of its characters. Of Connie Chatterley's indecisiveness, her husband's callousness, the gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors' persuasiveness - all are portrayed in a quiet, even manner until the climactic end. Necessarily, some of the language and imagery is mildly explicit (though you can read a lot worse in many of the magazines that lie around in dentists' waiting rooms), because Lady Chatterley's Lover affirms Lawrence's vision of individual regeneration through freely-expressed sexuality. The book's power and complexity make it a unique, original work-a triumph of passion and eroticism over sterility.<br />The next time you hear that something has been censored, question whether it is really to protect public morals (where war, and starvation appear to be more acceptable than freedom of sexuality), or whether it is to protect the censors' own frustrated identities! Lady C is a powerful reminder that all the censors have ever succeeded in doing is to ban outstanding literature in the name of public morality.
B000000OQF|4.0|First of all, you cant deny that this is one of the best albums of the eighties.  Guns and Roses were one of the few bands of the decade who played hard rock, but listening to it today is different.  Having grown up in the 90's it is easy to see how much of an eighties flavor this album has.  It was all about excess.  There are some points in the album where I ask myself, &quot;what is going on?&quot; There seems to be about 200 guitar parts/solos, the drums are SO loud and some of it seems just like noise.  However, the album has it's bright points in &quot;Sweet Child of Mine&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the jungle&quot;, and a few others.  While this album is hard rock all the way through, it ends on a bad note with , &quot;Don't ever leave me, Say you'll always be there,<BR>All I ever wanted was for you to know that I care&quot; - an unfitting end to a hard album.
014118213X|5.0|Forster's earliest fictional writings were short stories, many of them fantasies about men and women who  wanted to escape, from the stuffy social milieu that hemmed them in - from a dry colourless world into an infinitely expanding one. In later works, Forster had them desperately seeking the freedom to respond to a higher call.  This higher call was not religious in the conventional sense. E.M.Forster did not belong to any religion, and it is clear that his philosophy of life was man-centred, not God-centred. But personal development was important to him and he passionately believed that human beings need not stay stuck in groove but should be free to develop. <br />Thus, what  begins as a collection of seemingly unrelated events in Howards End gradually knits into a tightly woven story of tragic misunderstandings, impulsive actions, and irreparable consequences - and, eventually, &quot;connection&quot;, though Forster leaves the reader free to interpret &quot;connection&quot; as he or she will. &quot;Only connect!&quot; beseeches Margaret Schlegel as she contemplates the state of her soul (and others'). Maybe it is best that we decide for ourselves what form this 'connection' should take.<br />There are happy marriages in Forster's novels, but they do not come as the culmination of passionate love affairs. Forster himself was homosexual and, in view of the repressive climate of the time, decided to confine his less inhibited descriptions of sexual encounters to those between men in his novel Maurice and the later short stories which were not published till after his death. The first sexual incident in Howards End is a fumbled chaste kiss in a rose garden and the only other carnal exchange takes place offstage, its fruit coming as a bit of a surprise to the reader!<br />The proposed marriage between Margaret and Henry is not so much the consummation of physical love but rather a device for bringing together the conflicting ideals of two families, the Schlegels andthe Wilcoxes. Weaving its way through the story is the theme of balance, the need to integrate two essential qualities which tend to go to extremes. Margaret Schlegel, the central character, strives to integrate the opposing tendencies. <br />As so often in Forster's work, it is not a question of one or the other, reason or emotion, prose or passion, the outer life or the inner life, but of finding a middle way between the two. The two families are forever contrasted, but the novelist's aim was to bring them together, to bridge the gulf. The Wilcoxes - all except Mrs Wilcox - are for the outer life of business and getting things done, the life, as Helen puts it, 'of telegrams and anger', while the Schlegels are for the inner life of refinement, through culture and personal relations.<br />At the two extremes are Helen Schlegel on the one hand, and Henry Wilcox on the other. For Helen, the emotions and personal relations are everything. Speaking of them, she often echoes Keats famous phrase, 'the holiness of the heart's affections'. In complete contrast, Henry Wilcox says of himself: ''I am not a fellow who bothers about my own inside'. Outwardly he was cheerful and brave: but within all had reverted to chaos'. The whole drama of the novel turns on the conflict between these opposites.<br />Margaret's function is to strive to reconcile them, to bring about what seems an impossible union. She is the one to make the vital connection. 'Only connect...' is the famous epigraph of the novel. She has to 'build the rainbow bridge' as Forster puts it, between the prose and the passion, the prose of the Wilcoxes with the poetry of the Schlegels..<br />It's never easy reading a novel that was written almost 100 years ago. Sentence structures change. Word usage alters - sometimes imperceptibly other times more overtly. Yet Howards End, Forster's 1910 novel, has a timelessness that makes it good for another 100 years yet.  And just like Fortser's other works (especially Passageto India), Howards End looks at class, nationality, economic status, and how each of these affects personal relationships.<br />Read it with a sense of relief that, just maybe, things have not changed as much as we might imagine !
6301763041|5.0|This is a great movie. The music numbers are so esoteric as is the entire film. Johnny Depp was made for this movie. When you think about it: how could any movie with Johnny Depp and Troy Donahue be bad? Just try to be a little more understanding about this film. It is more than just camp. This is a true look at society through the eyes of John Waters. Insightful.
B000002J2F|5.0|Although several of the songs are good as stand alone, this work is best listened to from beginning to end, in order, to get the full effect of it, because it is a concept CD, and all the songs compliment each other.  This is not true of any CD of theirs since (although there are many great tracks on their other CD's).  I bought this as an LP back in the early 80's, and have bought it twice since, even though I thought the entire production as a weak showing compared to earlier works.  Now, it is one of my all-time faves, and I wouldn't be without it.  It certainly grows on you.<br />The entire production is well-produced, the songs are catchy, and songs like Heathaze and Misunderstanding really capture the heart.  Phil really puts feeling into the vocals (although you could say that of any of his work).
B00005QZWI|1.0|Silly, insipid score that has nothing to offer musically.  He overuses the chorus in reckless abandon and poor taste.<br />I hope the movie is far better than this tripe.
0553278223|5.0|The German students obviously don't have a decent grasp on the english language.  This is here to nullify their review.  I'm no fan of sci fi, but not being able to read the language doesn't mean the book is bad.
B00005T343|2.0|Hannibal has an entertaining story line, but when compared to its predecessor, Silence of the Lambs, it just doesn't stack up.<br />One problem is that Anthony Hopkins acts too much like Anthony Hopkins and not the evil Hannibal Lecter we met in the first movie.  This movie just isn't dark enough.  It has the requisite gratuitous violence, but not the creepiness.<br />Silence of the Lambs made me feel uncomfortable.  It was eerie and dark throughout; the movie had a sombre tone.  That tone is missing in Hannibal.  Dr. Lecter seems to have lost some of his pizazz in this movie.<br />It could have been better, soooo much better, but it isn't.  Rent this movie, don't buy it.  It is worth watching if you've seen Silence of the Lambs.

B00003CXSP|1.0|I went to see this movie because &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was so great--the suspense, the acting, the atmosphere.  Then, after a decade, they decided to make this sequel.  Jodie Foster Passed as should anyone else who may think this is going to be anywhere close to the edge-of-your-seat presence that &quot;Silence&quot; had.  <br />This film is all about gore.  It's about how much blood can be splashed around the scenery, how many body parts can be thrown about, how many bodies can be cut up. <br />There is no real plot other than a millionaire, who happens to be one of Hannibal's few surviving victims, who searches and captures Lechter.  Don't fret, Agent Starling (played unconvincingly in this film by a forgettable famous actress) saves him.  He gets away in a nick of time, though, due to her stupidity (yes, stupidity--in &quot;Silence&quot; Starling was a bit naive, here she's just plain stupid), obviously hoping for another sequel (which is in the works). <br />If you liked SOTL for it's story, plot, characterizations, and believablility, then you will surely detest this film.  I only with there was a zero on the scale.
B00005LOUP|1.0|it was the worst movie i had seen in a long time. it had no soul and no feeling. and  i was about to pull my hair out having to sit thru it. and then i breathed a sigh of relief when it was over. and i was so down from watching it that i had to see somthing good so i . poped in saving private ryan and my hair pulling was over.then i was happy.

B00003CXE7|4.0|While the plot is thin and the historical perspective is off, the action in this film is superb.  The openning battle is probably one of the best depictions of Roman warfare ever filmed.  Be advised, young children should not be allowed to view this film as it is very graphic.
074322454X|5.0|This book just like my title suggest here is one heck of a book. If you are interested in how our guys fought in WW2 this is it. Naturally the book concentrates at the company level but it offers insights really how the entire division was really special. Initially you I worried that since they are so many guys mention you won't keep track but Ambrose does a good job not to get you too lost. The hero are many in this book but the story of Major Winters is incredible. A real American hero. If you are someone that enjoy reading about world war 2 this is the book I recommend to get your hands on.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Diana Krall had the good artistic sense to hire Claus Ogerman to arrange the songs on this &quot;album&quot; (what a beautifully antiquated term).  These songs capitalize on the sultry side of her singing.  She makes Jane Monheit sound like a girlscout (which she probably is).  These songs carry you away into another realm, an aural landscape to enter and stroll around in.  Totally fetching, completely irresistible.  The purists who quibble with this or that minor (to my mind) detail are probably the same ones who never &quot;got&quot; Antonio Carlos Jobim.  They are lost souls.  Leave them to their Purgatory.  Leave me to my Paradise.
B00005214X|5.0|Isn't it a Pity that George is gone, but his music lives on...<BR>I have the three albums and also have bought the reissued cd's. The sound quality is improved and the alternative and bonus tracks are solid additions. All things must pass is by far, the best solo album put out by any of the Beatles. The material is top rate thanks to great 'session' players (like Eric Clapton, etc...)and the only way the songs could have been improved was if the Beatles actually played them. After this musical statement, Harrison's musical output was spotty, with average albums that contained 4 or 5 great songs each. Then came Cloud NIne in 1987, which was more focussed and energized. This resulted in the two Traveling Wilbury albums that brought Harrison back again full cirle (musically, if not commercially).<BR>If you want to create a Harrison, post Beatles, discography you can not go wrong with the above selections. All things must pass is the cornerstone to any great musical collections.Thank you George.
0812550706|5.0|I was given an outside reading assignmentin which I could pick any fiction book to read. The problem was I didn't have the slightest inkling on what to read. So I asked a friend of mine for some suggestions, and he told me that I should give the book &quot;Ender's Game&quot; a try. So I decided to read it.

6304005490|4.0|I think that Lover Come Back is the best of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson romantic comedies.  The humour is sharper and more adult, and all the actors nail their characters down perfectly.  Day and Hudson are rival advertising executives, with Day using the by-the-book approach, and Hudson wining, dining, and providing female companionship to lure and sign clients.  Through the kind of mixups you expect from one of their movies, Day comes to believe that Hudson is a client, and then things become complicated.  Tony Randall plays Hudson's boss, an insecure man that wants to protect himself above anything else, but who ends up paying the price over and over for Hudson's antics and schemes. The dialogue has a lot of funny lines and innuendos, and the three leads play it with relish.  The supporting cast of Edie Adams, Ann B. Davis, and others, all add to the fun.  Director Delbert Mann has a sure touch and keeps the film moving along briskly, and even though you can pretty much guess the conclusion, it's a lot of fun getting there.

B00005BKZJ|5.0|Absolutely marvelous. Have watched it at least 8 times, and enjoy it more everytime.
B00003CXTG|1.0|The movie billed itself as a historical recreation of this major event in U.S. history.  Instead it was a love triangle story with Pearl Harbor as the setting.  Most of the history in the movie was flawed.  This movie is an insult to Pearl Harbor veterans.
B000002OTL|5.0|The best movie sound track ever.
B00004RGUU|5.0|This 1969 film made box office history at the time and was nominated for seven academy awards. The public just loved it and I can well understand why. It broke the mold of the traditional western by being upbeat, lively and whimsical. And the stars, Paul Newman and Robert Redford, cast as bank robbers, had a special chemistry between them with their lighthearted wisecracks throughout. Katherine Ross plays the love interest of both of them and there's a great musical score by Burt Bacharach, most notably, &quot;Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head&quot; in which Newman and Ross ride around on a bicycle. The story was predictable and at times it seemed a little long, but I found myself smiling throughout and the actors were a pleasure to look at.<br />Even more than the film, though, I thoroughly enjoyed the &quot;add on&quot; which was included on the videotape. Entitled &quot;The Making of 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'&quot;, this was 52-minute documentary with the kind of interesting details that really enhanced my appreciation of the film. For example, there's a part in the movie that shows photos of the characters superimposed on old time photos from the 1890s. This is a technique that is relatively simple today by using any one of a number of computer programs. However, in 1969, they had to be actually pasted on. And it was also interesting to see how they do special effects with guns that shoot puffs of smoke. I loved this going behind the scenes.
6300216543|5.0|One of the best films of the early '70s.  Exceptional cast, wonderful music.  I recently enjoyed Tony Roberts on Broadway in &quot;The Allergists Wife&quot; which brought back memories of his performance in the Serpico movie.  I had to have it, immediately purchased the VHS edition and was not disappointed.  This is a mus purchase for any &quot;baby boomer&quot; that enjoyed such New York-based films and programs like Kojak, NYPD, Taxi Driver, etc.
B00003CXXI|2.0|Hmmmm . . . I get just about any video that comes out for my 3 and 7 yr old.  Shrek looked like just another video.  Well, it certainly isn't Disney.  Most parents expect a certain consistency in animated flicks.  Dream Works is is looking for a piece of he giant pie.  The up side to this video - Incredible graphics.  A little shocking really, from all the other 'kids' videos out there.  Obviously they tried to appeal more to adults.  The down side to the video - there is a lot of  'toilette' humor and innuendos that are inappropriate for most children.  Little songs that seemingly are about to end rhyming in words that most parents wouldn't allow their kids to say and at the last moment changing the words.  The princess singing a duet with a bird (cute), but them the bird explodes and she cooks her eggs.  My suggestion is that parents should maybe preview this one themselves before showing it to young children.
B00005JKES|5.0|Nothing can be said about this set other than THANK GOD, and maybe, IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!!! Had it on VHS forever, but the extra's and sound/video quality are going to make this set a completist's dream come true... Any David Lynch fan must buy this set.. It is a pre-requisite for entering the dream of lynchdome.... I cannot praise this series enough, but enough is enough... Buy it, love it, own it........ May Lynch grace us with all of his wonderful films on DVD....<br />-William Lawrence Porter
B00005QJDG|5.0|One of best live albums that was ever made.  With the tightness of the band and the reception of the audience brings the sound of Dream Dheater to new height.  If you are a you are just finding Dream Theater this is a must have.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is the story of a young boy who is forced to fulfill a destiny which he would not have chosen for himself.  In a time when children are bred and nurtured to become military prodigies, Ender is chosen as fulfilling the necessary criteria to become a dangerous weapon in the human population's battle against aliens who have attacked them in the past.  The focus of the book, however, is not this battle itself so much as the training Ender and his peers must undergo in order to be prepared for it.<br />Those selected as being of proper aptitude are removed from their families to the Battle School, a remote space station where students are formed into armies and undergo intense training in the &quot;game&quot; of battling each other in military formations.  The story is an interesting psychological examination of the turmoil in Ender's head as he continually faces the fact that his brilliance is intended by others to be used for violence.  He is the best in his school and is keenly aware of it, but this leads to being continually faced with harrassment (and worse) by the other students.  Ender must learn to handle this in order to prove himself as a capable leader, even as he wrestles with his internal desire to remain peaceful and abandon his training altogether.  As Card quotes from Jesus's words in the course of the story, &quot;I come not to bring peace, but the sword.&quot;<br />I find this an interesting examination of the role of violence-- in what situations can it be considered appropriate, or at least the lesser of two evils?  In the course of the book Ender commits acts which he considers reprehensible, but for which the rest of the world is all too ready to excuse him.  We as readers are forced to draw our own conclusions about the morality of Ender's actions.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Being an avid Disney obsessive, I was thrilled to learn that 'Snow White' was finally coming to DVD, and the one-year wait from the discovery was almost unbarable.  When I finally snapped up the discs this past week, I was well rewarded for the wait.<br />THE FILM -- ***** (5/5)<BR>At the center of the marvelous two-disc &quot;immersive experience&quot; is the jewel in the crown -- the film itself.  I forgot long ago how good of a movie it is, and have since seen it three times this week alone.  It truly is the best Disney feature, and I will never forget it; it really will live forever.<br />BONUS MATERIALS -- ***** (5/5) <BR>The vast extras are impossible to describe -- I'm emmensly impressed.  Favorites of mine include the &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot; music video, &quot;Dopey's Wild Mine Ride&quot; trivia game, &quot;The Goddess of Spring&quot; Silly Symphony cartoon, the &quot;Still the Fairest of Them All&quot; documentary, and disc two's memorable, educational, and exciting &quot;Disney Through the Decades,&quot; the restoration documentary, and all of the historically important &quot;Snow White&quot; trailers through the years.  Also interesting were the abandoned concepts in the Queen's Dungon, and much more.  You won't want to miss these extras.<br />All in all, it's a thrilling DVD -- one you're sure to want in your collection.  Speaking of collections, by the way, this title begins Disney's prestigous Platnum Edition series, which will continue next year with the long-awaited (finally) DVD debut of &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot;<br />TOTAL: ***** 5/5
B00003CX5P|1.0|In the fairy tales how do you get into a Castle?! Take the water ways or the secret passages. In The Phantom Menace how do you do it?! You use them both! I found the plot extremely clinched. I doubt there was anything original in the movie. That wasn't even really the worst though. All the charm of Star Wars was gone. R2D2 was reduced to a computer on wheels without a personality. Also the action looks ridiculous because the Jedis are obviously just swinging in any which direction and then the bullets they hit are added by computer graphics. And the out come I think would be better described as dancing rather than fighting.  To make that worse during most all the action sequences the actors look like they are doing anything, but struggling.  How can the watcher be excited when the actor looks bored?  The acting through out the entire film was amateurish. Lastly I should mention the plot was almost entirely driven by consciences not by any logical construction.  I love the original Star Wars, but I hate this.
B00005QK3W|5.0|After to have listened to several times the album, I can say that it's really excellent. All Macca's albums has own style, So it is the case of Driving Rain. <BR>My message From a Fan to the World is : buy this cd... you enjoy...<BR>Good Work Sir Paul McCartney.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Well well well, the typical comparison abound. As human nature dictates, to emit judgement or opinion we usually need to anchor ourselves in a point of reference.  It is therefore not surprising that many a critic find a certain Alanis Morrisette air to Shakira's special vocalization.  Guys, let me tell you, nothing further from the truth.  Although in sound they might be similar, a more careful listening of the particulars yields an original, and indeed quite autoctonous sound. Shakira's vocalization has particularly made her popular on latin circles ever since her &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; release. In fact it is the mix of this particular sound with the potent pop production of her songs which has yielded a highly successful formula for the young artist.  Similar techniques can be heard from other colombian female singers (Aterciopelados, anyone?).  In short, an artist &quot;similiarity&quot; with a particular technique should always be carefully examined before emiting judgement.  <br />  In terms of Shakira's maturity as an artist, there's no question that there's plenty of room for the development of her own artistic persona.  I'm quite convinced that her vocalization will continue to be one of her signatures, but poignant lyrics, more attention to artistic production (as opoosed to dance hall pop production), and a continuation of the deep penetration of her publicity campaign throughout the america's (and other parts of the world) will certainly be factors in her growth in the near future.  On the other hand, she could always follow Madonna's path and become a latin female pop-phenomenon  For now, I'm off to dance enjoy her latest work in my next party.
B000050FEN|5.0|This movie from beginning to end from every aspect is as solid as any I've seen.  Whether it be the plot, character development, musical score, setting..everything about this movie was created...no...meticulously crafted to give a very real and grim presentation.  This is without question the best movie about serial killers and detectives.  It never gained the recognition is deserved, but will always be one of the top favorites on my shelf.
0446525537|5.0|The book was absolutely &quot;marvelous&quot; =o).  As soon as I started I couldnt put it down.  Moved me to tears.  The tale is about love, faith, kindness, and tragedy.  It was absolutely a terrific book.  I recommend it to every one.
6302794331|5.0|This is the most enjoyable versions of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; ever made.  Dickens should be flattered.  You can't get any better than the muppets, and Michael Caine is delightful.  I have made watching it one of my Christmas traditions.  It wouldn't be Christmas without it!
158234082X|4.0|Okay, I've read a lot of the reviews from other readers who complain about how base and arrogant Bourdain seems in this book.  Let me tell you that his personality and style are not atypical in his industry.  What he describes is true in any working kitchen and it takes just his type of personality to succeed in that environment.  Bourdain is rightly unapologetic.<br /><br />The part everyone else seems to hone in on are the reasons never to order well-done meats or fish on Monday.  Good advice but, to me, the most fascinating section is where Bourdain describes the various types of restaurant owners and why each of them is doomed to failure.  In my opinion, this section should be required reading at culinary and business schools.<br /><br />The one flaw of the hardcover edition is that it seems to have been sloppily edited.  One particular section seems to feature run-on sentences in an effort to convey the hectic environment of a kitchen.  It works for the first few paragraphs but it continues for an entire chapter.  Otherwise, I'd give this a full 5 stars, based solely upon how much I enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />In short, If you want a true insight into what making food in a commercial (i.e. REAL) kitchen for a living is actually like, read this book.  If you're the type of person who could sit in a studio audience and actually applaud when the TV chef utters the words \\"garlic\\" or \\"olive oil,\\" seek insight elsewhere.  But don't say you weren't warned.
B0000542DJ|5.0|This is the best film you could ever watch about the JFK assassination.   The movie compells you to research the events leading up to the conspiracy that ended the life of the 35th President of the United States.<br />Some people have complained that elements within the &quot;JFK&quot; version of the conspiracy are historically inaccurate and fabricated.   This was done on purpose by Oliver Stone so people will look at the real-world evidence for themselves and discover the truth.   What is the truth?   The truth is that a conspiracy occured on November 22nd, 1963 because there is no way in the entire existence of universe that one man could engineer all the events that led up to Kennedy's assassination.<br />Those who continue to believe that Oswald did it alone will always be in denial and are forever brainwashed by the Warren Commission.   Anybody who watches the Zapruder film and doesn't see the glaring evidence of a gunman on the grassy knoll when Kennedys head falls back and to the left during the head-shot is either ignorant, stupid or both.  People who believe that Arlen Specters &quot;magic bullet&quot; can pause, stop, spin and do U-turns in mid-air to make the seven wounds in Kennedy and Connally, will believe the moon is made out of green cheese and walk off a cliff when told to do so.     <br />Two versions of history have been a war with each other since that fateful day in 1963; written history and memorized history.   <br />Written history is designed for those who want to control your thoughts with mind control.   Memorized history will always keep your mind free from those who want to control your thoughts.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I believe that the power of a truly great composer is that which enables him or her to come up with a simple tune - a hook - that complements itself effectively with every other suite or piece of music that runs through the soundtrack of a work of art. John Williams powerfully proves that he has that skill. So, whether or not you feel Chris Columbus did a good job directing \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\", you cannot surpass his wise choice of having Mr. Williams piece together this truly spellbinding score.<br />Yes, now and again he indulges in self-plagiarism, but all that is conveniently covered up with the playful running theme that materialises most compellingly in \\"Hedwig's Theme\\", and pops in as daintily as it sounds in the rest of the music against appropriately spine-tingling and triumphantly composite compositions. The entire soundtrack - as track-listed here - builds up in a wicked crescendo that easily sweeps one of his feet and transports him back to the magic of Harry's world. From the dark and ominous \\"Harry's Wondrous World\\", sprinkled cleverly with a tinge of hope, to the orchestral climax in \\"The Face of Voldermort\\", which erupts in musical irony when it sets \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" against cold, bombarding strings, John Williams creates his very own original (well, almost) rendition of J. K. Rowling's meticulously imaginative dimension - all embodied in every single likeable piece.<br />A feature which proves comforting for the listener - especially younger children who could go crazy over everything \\"Harry\\" - is that almost every piece is a suitably short, three to four-minute long opus. But even the longer pieces, such as the exhilarating \\"The Quidditch Match\\" that spans some eight minutes long, fleet by as enjoyably as the movie does in its unbelievably \\"short\\" 2½ hours. This piece, in particular, is one of my favourites, as it regenerates the majestic memory of the Arthurian-styled Quidditch setting, and the pure intensity of the game.<br />The soundtrack springs up a few surprises here and there. For example, in \\"Christmas at Hogwarts\\", you can actually hear caroling ghosts! And \\"Diagon Alley and The Gringotts Vault\\" is considerably varied from what is heard in that sequence of the movie, though it retains its good cheer. But it is sad that some of the music from the movie has been left out in this soundtrack (it appears to be a trend many composers and producers are following nowadays). For example, the original music for the Diagon Alley sequence had more \\"oomph\\" to it, and gave it a sense of jolly enthusiasm remarkably symbolic of how Harry must have felt visiting that venue for the first time. The light-hearted flutes that you hear instead on the soundtrack cannot beat the former, which initially created the right atmosphere so well. And also - I'm not sure if anyone noticed this - during the part of the movie before Harry, Ron, Hermione and Draco went off into the woods with Hagrid for detention, there was a Celtic-sounding tune being played with a very ghostly feel in the background while they were all huddled around the fire, and Filch asked Hagrid to \\"keep his wits about\\". I was looking out for that tune, hopefully in a piece that accompanied The Forbidden Forest sequence, but even such a piece wasn't included at all.<br />There's quite a bit to miss out on listening to this soundtrack, and it's a pity that not all of John Williams' work could be included here, especially being the first movie on the teenage wizard and all. But still, Mr. Williams rightfully boasts that he can recreate and bring life once more to the little bit of magic that remains in this world. Very hopefully, he will continue with the rest of the movies in the \\"Harry Potter\\" series, and remain masterful in evoking the power of magic, music and the emotion they bring about in the life of the world's most beloved teen wizard.
B00005214X|5.0|This album has only been re-issued once.  The original cd format was released in the 80's.  This new and improved version is the latest.  It surpasses the original in quality.  I can actually hear the strings ringing on the acoustic guitars!!!  If you're going to get a George Harrison cd, may it be this one!!  In my opinion it is his best work, and also I believe it is the best solo Beatles album by far.  &quot;George, we're gonna miss ya!&quot;
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya is one of the most talented New Age Artists that I have had the pleasure of listening to!  Not only does she write, compose, and perform her own work; she does it with great feeling and a real sense of peaceful, refreshing music that we so desperately need in these times.  I would whole-heartedly recommend her music to anyone wishing to experience a calm like none before!
B00005JKHP|5.0|I do not know what else to say but excellent, superb, fantastic, Star Trek The Motion Picture is finally a movie I can watch over and over again!  It moves right in to the next thing quickly and smoothly.....  The added effects were beautifully done and the editing was right on.<BR>I loved this movie from start to finish, it was like getting to see the original crew in one more film, and I loved every minute of it.  I was hoping to see Enterprise NX-01 in the rec room when Decker showed Ilia the other ships named Enterprise, that opportunity was either overlooked or not enough time to get it in there before the DVD release.  But that would have made this movie 100% flawless.<BR>This is now by far my very favorite Trek Movie (...) <BR>If you do not have this DVD, you must get it!  Rather you are a Trek fan or not, now everyone will enjoy it.  Robert Wise is .. Wise, he did exactly what needed to be done. (...)
B00005NTNU|5.0|One of the better box sets that I have had the privlege to buy.  The transfer onto DVD is excellent, and the set's picture clarity, and surround sound is second to none.  I could hope for a couple of more extras to go with the set, but I don't want to split hairs.  I still find these movies very enjoyable to watch and as I said with the picture being nicely cleaned up.  It looks like they were filmed yesterday instead of thirty years ago!!  Enjoy!!
0553579908|5.0|Could this book be any better? I don't think so, and I will tell you why. <br />The Song of Ice and Fire takes place primarily in Westeros, a rich and varied land that was once divided into seven seperate kingdoms but was united under the Targaryens, who were later overthrown by Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon. Robert took the Iron Thrown of the Seven Kingdoms and later took Eddard Stark as his hand. After both Eddard and Robert were killed, due to the shceming of Queen Cersei, her brother and lover Jaime Lannister, Westeros was divided with 6 factions fighting for the right to the Iron Throne. The Lannisters,The Starks,The Ironmen, Stannis Baratheon,Renly Baratheon, and Queen Danaerys Stormborn, the last remaining Targaryen. <br />Now, with the back story out of the way, here are my impressions. <br />One thing I like about George R.R. Martin is he always manages to surprise you. In both A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings he has several HUGE twists that you would NEVER expect. He is never scared of killing main characters, and their are several that die in this sequel. <br />Martin decieves you, and near the end of the book you THINK that a couple of main characters die for about 6 chapters before he reveals the truth. For those six chapters you are CERTAIN that they are dead, and then BOOM, you find out that they are alive. Wow. There aren't many authors that can convince you like Martin manages to do. <br />This book is intense. The Naval Battle at King's Landing couldn't have been done better than it was, and Jon's adventures on the other side of the wall are very cool. <br />I finished this book in about a week, which is good for me considering that it is nearly 1000 pages. Buy this book NOW.

0743420373|4.0|If you enjoy in-depth demographic studies or just really want to know what makes a person wealthy, this is the book for you. For the most part the book is an easy read that uses disguised real-life case studies to show how people become rich and how some people with high incomes never accumulate wealth (net worth). <br />The authors are professors and have done a great deal of quantitative study on the subject. To that end the book is packed with tables of numbers to help the reader understand the subject. The tables have a lot of good data but sometimes you feel like you are reading a thesis. If you spend the time to really understand the numbers it will help you get a much more in-depth understanding of people with a net worth of one million dollars or more. If you gloss over the tables and concentrate on the personal stories you will still get a pretty good idea of the type of person they are talking about.<br />At the end of the book is a chapter with a few hints on how to target market wealthy people. These are high level ideas and not a &quot;how-to&quot; section. The authors sell that advice as consultants and are not about to give away all of thier valuable secrets. Also, there is a discussion of what type of work millionaire's do. This part is very wishy-washy, as the authors explain that millionaires do all types of work.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|If you got this far, you are probably interested in getting this historical concert on DVD. Filmed at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in November of 1997, I can attest that having been at this concert, it is remarkable. Over 30 hits with a great light-show presentation was accompanied by live duets with Celine Dion on &quot;Immortality&quot;, a pre-recorded duet with Franki Valli on a blasting &quot;Grease&quot; and a truly heartbreaking quartet with the late brother Andy Gibb on &quot;(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away&quot;. The large movie screen served as a backdrop for many old family videos as well as the Bee Gees performing songs from over four decades.<br />The technicalities: If you have a simple DVD player without a DTS Surround Sound player and receiver, you can buy any of the DVD's. If you are fortunate enough to own a DTS Surround capable DVD player and receiver, you are set for what the concert really sounded like! Remember that this was recorded in the 80,000 plus seat MGM Grand and the acoustics add something that is different than a regular studio recording. The crowd is recorded perfectly to coincide with the performance. Check your system, then decide. If you plan on a new system, I highly recommend spending a few extra bucks and getting this DTS Surround feature. It is that good.
B00005JH7D|5.0|What takes this album beyond Tales? Is it Marcus Miller's eclectic mix of jazz styles, moods and voicings? Is it his lyrical composition? Is it his incredible bass-playing? Nup...all these feature on both albums. Where M2 really evolves is in the broader use of brass, orchestral and synth arrangements, giving a fuller, more mature sound that never impedes the energy flow of these great songs. This is shown in the various Ozell interludes, each adding another layer to its predecessor. And even more powerfully on songs like the remake of Billy Cobham's classic Red Baron, where the arrangements increase the funkiness of what was already one of the alltime great groove-pieces (see BC's Spectrum album for the original). Brilliant.
B00005RFQ5|1.0|Look, I been a Prince fan for a long long time. I have all the cd's. I stuck up for the man when everybody was saying he lost his R&amp;B style. I go out and by this cd and im very very unhappy. Im not feel'n this cd at all!!! No way No how. I really feel he lost his thang after the Gold cd. It was all down hill from there. Prince if U read these reviews man. Please get back with it man. Bring the Revolution back or something. I cant even jam this in the car. Michael Jackson's new cd is 50 times better than this. And he comes out with a cd every 5 years. This Rainbow Children cd is straight garbage!  Got to come better than this Prince. Like Billy said in Purple Rain &quot;U better kick azz on the next one Kid.&quot;
B00005OM4Q|5.0|For one stunning moment, it was the 1970's again and my life was perfect.  <br />The movie was a loving reminder of my youth and it brought me back there again, it all came alive for me in such a personal way.   Almost Famous struck so many emotional and melodic chords that for the first time I truly appreciated every convoluted and glorious moment spent in every day-glow painted bedroom.  The movie was like a backstage pass into life.    <br />For a good part of the movie, I WAS YOUNG AGAIN, I hated it when the movie was over and the only way to get that feeling again is to play the movie again.  It's addicting.<br />I wanted to hold Penny Lane just one more time and be there listening to Zepplin, Yes and the Allman Brothers....   To relive the parties, the concerts and the experiences of my youth in a carefree manner... Oh what a glorious movie.  <br />If you don't own this movie, you must.  It is a great ballad to the rock bands,  those who love music and to all of us who grew up to the passionate, moving and emotional rock music and times of the 60's and 70's<br />You will watch Almost Famous and listen to the wonderfully produced soundtracks over and over and over again.<br />Have a good trip....  I just wish I never came down...
B00003CXRM|5.0|I work at a theatre and saw tons of people going into this movie.  The write up I had was rather uninspiring so I had to see what everyone else knew that I didn't.  This completely redneck, off-kilter retelling of Homer's Odyssey is a complete must-see.  There's no way to describe the seamless union of &quot;Old-Timey&quot; music with modern movie making and a hillarious plot, you just need to watch it.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I think four and a half stars would have been more appropriate.<br />John Williams' score for the ultra-popular Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is quite worth buying.  Magic exudes from every track, and listening to each theme, I can easily visualize the corresponding scenes.  It takes a master composer to truly pull this off.<br />One thing I fault Williams for: lack of creativity.  Some people might go off on a limb and call it expanded style, and I can see where they're coming from, but while listening to this soundtrack before seeing the movie, I couldn't help but think of other movies with similar themes.  It's like seeing cameo appearances of Home Alone, Jurassic Park, Star Wars, and ET.  Fun, but faintly irritating.<br />A great soundtrack, and I highly recommend it for purchase.  :)
6305718954|4.0|I was with a group of friends and they picked the movie, I then went back to see it four more times.  A visually stunning and emotionally stirring movie it can't all be taken in in one viewing.  Also having seen the video, I can tell you it had more effect on the big screen.  I wouldn't compare this movie to anything else as that does a disservice to Stigmata and to the other films it is compared to.  This movie is haunting and spiritual at the same time as being thrilling and terrifying.  I don't give it five stars only because the ending left me unsatisfied, The characters had all been through life changing events but you didn't see any final evidence of those changes.  The old stories of an atheist, an unsure priest, and the paranoia of the Catholic Church, are all brought to a younger audience through this thriller.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I love celtic-type music, I love vocal movie themes, and I love Enya's music.  Funny...this soundtrack has it all!<br />Recently usurping the crown of *Drex's Favorite Movie Soundtrack* from the beautiful Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Howard Shore's Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack has much to offer.  Haunting, ethereal melodies abound.  Multiple talented vocalists lend their aid to this brilliant work of art.<br />There are five tracks that use vocals, and I'll touch on them more so than the others.  My favorite instrumental tracks are The Treason of Isengard and Concerning Hobbits, which include some themes that pop up throughout the soundtrack.<br />Four of the five vocal tracks utilize the ancient elven tongue, lending more of an air of mystery to the work.  There is a lament for one of the Fellowship (I'll not spoil it for those ignorant of the plot) in &quot;Lothlorien&quot; which uses the Elven tongue extensively.<br />Aniron (contained in &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot; is the beautiful love theme of the human Aragorn (Strider) and the Elven princess Arwen.<br />In Dreams (contained in &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot;) is my second favorite piece in here.  A haunting ethereal sound is produced by a boy soprano, backed by an all-boys' choir.  A wonderful Celtic-type tune, and Edward Ross's voice floats above the music, perfectly capturing the meaning in the lyrics.<br />&quot;May It Be&quot; is my favorite track, the featured theme by Enya.  Though it carries many of Enya's trademark progressions and sounds, it is truly unique and beautiful, with perfect lyrics to match.  I saw an interview with Enya dealing with her work on Lord of the Rings, and she seemed genuinely happy to be working with such a legend, and to be able to mold music to fit.  Her enthusiasm to make this work really shows.<br />All in all, a *MUST* buy.  Exquisite work, I only wish there was more to go around.
B000002UAU|5.0|The fact that this album is almost 35 years old and is in the billboard top 200 today should tell you something...&quot;A day in the life&quot; still takes people to a different level every time they here it,even today!
B00000099Y|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the greatest album ever recorded.  Tool grab the musical perfection and artistry of bands like Frank Zappa and Pink Floyd and mix it with the anger and ferocity of bands like Slayer and the Misfits to make something that is completely their own.  Every song in this album is an audiable piece of art, from the great guitar notes on \\"Stinkfist\\", the ***-up lyrical content of \\"Hooker With A Penis\\" and the ferocity of the title track, this album simply doesn't disappoint.  I can't imagine someone calling themselves a music fan without loving this album.  It's simply perfect.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is a collection of all the Beatles songs that were(1)released as singles in America or Britain, and,(2) hit the no 1 spot on the charts,thats why it's called &quot;1&quot;.And yes, the Beatles hit the top 27 TIMES in 7 years,and here they are on one cd... rock on George,wherever you are!
6305922748|4.0|Spinal Tap is a very entertaining movie that pokes fun at the pretensions we've all come to associate with washed up rock stars. <br />However, this movie also has something to say on a religious level that escapes most people. Did you notice that the band's fortunes really start to decline when they dismiss their manager Ian? In other words...they lose &quot;faith&quot;. <br />Then when they perform at the amusement park amphitheater did you notice the people giving them the &quot;thumbs down&quot;. Well, that was the signal in Roman times for the performers(usually gladiators) to be killed. When Ian returns they are resurrected to tour Japan. <br />I know, I know, people will say I'm reading way to much into a movie that's just meant to provoke a good laugh(which it does). But there's to much symbolism in this movie for it to be dismissed as coincidence. <br />This is a multi-layered movie that is well worth your time and money.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I found Paul McCartney's last solo album of original songs, &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; to be largely half-baked. While &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; did contain a few strong pop tracks such as &quot;Young Boy&quot; (the one track from the album that really stuck in my head), I found many of the tracks to be lacking any real emotion or strength. I thought Paul had finally grown old.<br />With &quot;Driving Rain&quot; Paul's somehow manages to sound young again. His voice is strong and full of emotion. On nearly every track he sounds as if he's singing from deep down within his very soul. The songs keep getting better with every listen and there are many memorable tunes to be found here, such as &quot;I Do&quot;, &quot;From A Lover To A Friend&quot;, &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot;, &quot;Driving Rain&quot; and &quot;Your Loving Flame&quot;. There's the exciting, extended &quot;Rinse The Raindrops&quot; which reminds me a little of &quot;Nineteen Hundred And Eighty Five&quot; (from the &quot;Band On The Run&quot; album, although I like the new track better), and some other great tracks such as &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;Heather&quot; and &quot;Your Way&quot;.<BR> <BR>The album has a very 'live' sound to it with very wide stereo separation much like the albums of the mid-1960s, which makes it easier to listen to the individual instrument parts, something which I've always liked in older recordings.<br />The 'last minute' addition of &quot;Freedom&quot; ('live' from Madison Square Garden) sounds great right after &quot;Rinse The Raindrops&quot;. While it may not be among the strongest songs Paul's ever written it is very poignant and it delivers its message powerfully, from the &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;-esque claps to Paul's strong vocal.<br />All in all, the strongest album I've heard, by anyone, in the new millennium thus far. Well done, Sir Paul!
0385505833|1.0|the premise (peer pressure for conformity) and the gimmick used to end it seemed to be the writings of an ambitious high school student.  of particular offense was the racial insult as part of the ending's gimmick.  mr. grisham should apologize for this early sign of holiday greed.
B00005QG9J|3.0|Well, I was wondering if this was going to happen here; I was woundering just how far INCUBUS was going to take this sound. I am not saying this is a good or a bad thing, but where did tracks like &quot;New Skin&quot;, &quot;Vitamin&quot;, and &quot;Favourite Things&quot; go anyway? Heck, I would even accept &quot;Privilege&quot;, &quot;Nowwhere Fast&quot;, and &quot;Out From Under&quot; as good substitutes. However, if you are like me and enjoy those songs, then this is not the album for you. If you liked songs like &quot;Summer Romance&quot; and &quot;Stellar&quot; then you are going to really, really like this album. <BR>THE GOOD: 1) MUSICAL GROWTH. Once again, INCUBUS shows that they are one of the, if not the leading band out there concerning originallity. This album, the bands third offering, is excellent if graded stricly upon musical growth. Every aspect of the band is blended well and their sound has a real polished feel to it. Excellent work guys!<BR>2) VOCALS. Once again Branden shines. This album does nothing if not display the amazing talent that he possess vocally. The band really is shaped by his ability to reach into his soul for inspiration and translate what he finds into his vocals.<BR>3) SOFT SIDE. It is nice to see a band who is not afriad of showing the 'softer side' of themselves. That is what this album does. Every band members talent is displayed completely.<BR>THE BAD: 1)DRASTIC MUSIC CHANGE. Where the heck did SCIENCE go anyway? Was that only to get public attention? I took the cheese...<BR>2) TOO MUCH CHEESE. This album seems to be made for one specific audience type only; the TRL audience. That is not to say that this is a bad thing, only that this might not appeal to those people who loved the first album and excepted the second.<BR>THE BOTTOM LINE: If this album is, by some people's accounts, the pinnacle of creation for INCUBUS, then I would like to be cast down the mountain. I would not buy this album other then if you are a hardcorefan or someone that is looking to broaden their musical collection into the area of space-age sound. Consider how you feel about SCIENCE when you are waiting in line to buy this album. Also, have a look around and see what else is out before you go and spend your hard earned dollars on this one. This album is not a &quot;must have&quot;....well, only if you are trying to keep your INCUBUS collection complete like myself...
B00000J2PH|5.0|I have always had a sentimetnal attachement to this album. I first heard it in June 1971 and always associated it with graduating High School. While it is true that Carole King although having a good voice is not the greatest singer of all time - what a writer and piano player she is. &quot;I Feel the Earth Move, 'You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman', &quot;It's Too LAte', 'Up On The Roof', 'Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow', 'Tapestry&quot; - it just does not get any better then that. This album is a collectors item.
B000002N2Z|4.0|When I first heard of the Def Tones, I thought they were a punk band. They were touring on the Vans Warp Tour and most of the other bands on that tour had a punk sound. And then I heard &quot;engine no.9&quot;....oh God....what a song. That was the day that my life changed forever. This band blew away every other sound I had heard up to that point. Simply put, this album is amazing.<BR>THE GOOD: 1) HARDCORE. Every track goes for broke and hits you in the face like you where a baseball and the album was Barry Bonds looking for # 72! This band holds nothing back and I am glad for that. Finally, a debue from a band that knows excately who they are and what they want to do musically.<BR>2) LEAD SINGER. Just like in INCUBUS, this band is made its powerful lead singer. It is his emotions and his pain that you feel in each track, however the band is not lost within his expression either. Nice blend.<BR>THE BAD: 1) THE BAND. Just like Korn had to catch up to J. Davis's vocals, so does this band. The lead singer is just that good. This is not neccessarily a bad thing because it will offer oppurtunities to grow musically, but until that happens it has to be classified a negative.<BR>THE BOTTOM LINE: Wow, only one bad thing to say that is simply amazing for me. Usually I like to give 3 good and 3 bad things about an album, but here I can only find 1 bad and 2 good. To sum it all up, every metal head who calls themselves a metal head has to have this album. This album is a &quot;must have&quot; album.
B000002H33|5.0|\\"Master of Puppets\\" Awsome album the break throuth Metalica album. \\"Battery\\" is a good track with Slayer like speed. \\"Master of Puppets\\" is the best song on the album. Hell James sings about by favorite thing! (Just kidding!!!). If you have the C.D. you know what i'm talking about.\\"The thing that should not be\\", is very good. The bass riff in the beginning reminds me of Nirvana. \\"Sanitarium\\", good a little like \\"One\\" From the Justise Album. \\"Disposable Heroes\\" ain't to good. But good. \\"Leper Messia\\" is awsome good riff all around. \\"Orion\\" has a thrash riff that is one of the best riffs in the world. \\"Damage INC.\\" is good, not as good as oh say \\"Leper Messiah\\". This album is  one of the best of them all. Hell I got my Dad Humming it whenever I play it. Need I tell you he's an Anti-medal person!
B00005O5N1|3.0|Good movie? Yes. Great movie? No.  It's true that Renee Zellweger did a good job with her English accent, and she's a fine actress--BUT, there have to be at least 100 British actresses that could have done the role at least as well, if not better.  Thoughts of her in her other roles as Nurse Betty and in Jerry Maguire, for instance, kept intruding and kept me from believing, &quot;Renee Zellweger IS Bridget Jones...&quot;  Nah.  If Colin and Hugh hadn't been so very good as their characters, and if the screenplay hadn't done justice to the original Diary, this wouldn't be even a good movie.  Read the book AFTER you see the movie, otherwise you'll just want to slap Renee for spoiling the character.
0804106304|5.0|A recommended book for anyone with a desire for a great book. A perfect book for a teenager wondering much about his heritage this is great book. Having many things to relate to.  Such as how his family is and how it feels to be growing up now a days I have also seen the movie which is almost as good as the book but is missing some scenes and in a different order than the book.  Reading this book has gotten me to want to read all of her other books. Amy Tam has to be one of the best Chinese or Asian American writers out there at this time.  She makes the connection between our roots and our present day of living in the world.  To who and me my roots are who makes me the person I am today I will become in my years to come. So I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks these thoughts are just as importantly and who wants to read a GREAT book!
B00005K9LM|2.0|This album rocks. It has Halford singing in real fine form, the songs are tight and strong. So why I rated it two stars? Simple: I just would like to know why (...) producer Tom Allom (or the band) decided to kill Dave Hollands drumming in this album????!!!! Why his precise and simple sound (which flourished in BRITISH STELL and POINT OF ENTRY) was replaced by the horrible kind of electronic / reverb sound disgracefully associated forever with hair metal???!!! IF you can sort of \\"not listen\\" the drums in this album, you will find DEFENDERS OF THE FATIH is very good.
B000002ORU|2.0|Im sorry to say this, but buying this compilation will not solve your problems corcerning possessing the best of THE WHO. The WHO was always a limited band, so you cant simply throw their songs together in any kind of compilations. You must have their best albuns (WHOS NEXT, TOMMY and QUADROPHENIA), where the songs sounds much better inside the context. This box set is overblown and one of the worst of its kind.
B000001F7R|4.0|This is Def Leppards debut, produced by Tom Allom, of Judas Priests fame. And what a debut. The band really rocks here. There are glimpses already of the kind of pop-metal they would perform later, but this album here is the real thing. The band sounds fresh, passionate, not overproduced, metal and rock blended together in perfect harmony. Rick Allen still did decent drumming (Im not talking about his terrible accident, because in PYROMANIA - still before the accident -  he quit &quot;playing&quot;, changing it for the awful kind of &quot;electronic&quot; drum machine sound, that wnet on and on through HYSTERIA, etc, etc. You cant argue against numbers We all know that with PYROMANIA and HYSTERIA Leppard sold more than ten million albuns. But they also transformed themselves in hair-metal, a thing I despise and really hate. The fact is: if I could pick only one Leppard album, would be this one and HIGH N DRY. Never it would be PYROMANIA or HYSTERIA or any other album.
B000000OMB|5.0|This debut is amazing, one of the best ever. It sold more than five million copies. Steve Howe, Carl Palmer, Geoff Downes and John Wetton wrote music history here. All the tracks are killers, catchy but strong, pop but heavy, simple but complex. Of course, such marvelous chemistry couldnt last long, and their next effort, ALPHA, was a complete turkey. (but sold more than one million copies!!)
B000002JK4|4.0|I wont give no explanations as why I like this second Plant solo album. I just like it. Thats all. No need to compare or to philosophy about it. ITs just good music.
B000007VCM|5.0|While U2 often gets credit for creating some of the rare meaningful musical moments of the 80s (and rightfully so), Love by the Cult is perhaps the most overlooked album of greatness from that decade. But let's not be time-constricted. When this 1985 opus was produced, it was lightyears ahead of its time and still stands true to any test in the new century. The fact of the matter is, just about every rock interest has tried to lay claim to this album and this band. Alt rockers claim it, metal heads claim it, goths claim it. It's all testiment to the fact that no one has ever been able to pin down the Cult to any label and Love demonstrates that better than anything. She Sells Sanctuary and Rain obviously lean toward the alternative flair. Big Neon Glitter may have some Goth although I always thought the goths were out of line for claiming this album. Then there's The Phoenix... WOW! a molten deluge of psychadelia laced with incantations and mysticism. The title track of the album is clearly the defining moment. Enigmatic, hypnotic, powerful, Love, the song, cannot be dismissed by any true rock fan. Is it metal or alternative? Sabbath or Smitherines? The lyrics to the song Love are equally elusive, &quot;Gonna drive away in a big fast car, gonna drive away won't get too far, gonna drive away don't know how far, gonna drive away in a big fast car...  don't you love those sweet times...&quot;<BR>What the hell is lead singer Ian Astburry talking about? I don't know, but it sounds damn good. This album also launches and hallmarks the talents of guitar journeyman Billy Duffy. While Duffy has made strides and vaunted efforts since Love, he has yet to repeat the tight-wired sound and pin-point accuracy as has been captured on this work. Duffy is a guitar virtuoso who has been woefully overlooked in the random and subjective discussions among rock fans and critics alike.<BR>Love, the album, also demonstrates the will to advance and evolve. The previous effort in album by theCult, Dreamtime, is infantile in comparison. It's hard to believe this is the same band that spat out Dreamtime in some makeshift Duran Duran poser mistake only one year prior to the production of Love. Love lifts this band to levels few others have even thought about. It's a lofty level that even The Cult has not repeated. As Ian Astburry says in the title track, &quot;I believe in love, I believe in my visions. I'll travel far.&quot; To not have this album in your collection is akin to having a missing link in the armour of any rock warrior.<BR>Your most humble and loyal servant,<BR>Dixonator<BR>Adventurer/patriot extraordinaire
B00005R2M3|2.0|This cd has been in it's case sincethe day i bought it. And it'shorrible for me to say this but it's not my favorite. I have gone from admiring her talents and music to just not being sure of what to think. I think i was serioudly one of hr biggest fans when she released her cd pies descalzos to dondeestan los ladrones. Sh is a true inpiration. The writes and produces her own songs. But she shouldn't do it in english. I think the only good song on the cd is the last song, which is in spanish. Her voice in english needs practice. I am just speaking what i think. She will always be my favorite singer. But to me this new path she's taking is just not the right one. I'm sorry if i offened fans or even shakira. I will continue to listen to her spanish cds forever.
0800196767|5.0|One of my all time favorites.  I have watched this movie at least five times and I still enjoy it as much as the first time.  A must for family movie collections.
0140177396|5.0|The book Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is an excellent book with a sad ending. The book focuses on two main characters George and Lennie. George and Lennie have a great friendship throughout the book, which inspires all. The reason they have such a great friendship is because George takes care of Lennie. Lennie is a lovable character that turns out to be a little slow and without George would not survive. George must treat him like a kid throughout the book just to try and keep Lennie out of trouble. These two friends are constantly getting into trouble in the book, but it is usually an accident. Lennie is behind all the trouble, and even though he is a strong and gigantic man, he really is very loving and kind. The two men go around working on farms so they can save up enough money to by their own farm. This dream is what motivates them and sets them apart from all others in the book. (...) <br />This was an excellent story ending in tragedy. You immediately fall in love with George and Lennie and their close friendship. As you learn about Lennie more and discover his very loving inside, you appreciate greatly what George does for Lennie. George is the definition of a friend and you do not find out until the end just how much he cares for Lennie. (...) <br />This book was on the banned book list because of its language. The language was too much at times, but did offer a taste into how life really was. It was not needed though to reveal the theme of friendship at the end. So I can understand why this book would be challenged. I myself enjoyed it to the highest degree, and therefore would recommend to anyone who would not mind the language.
B00004TDRD|5.0|Grab this tight-fisted monster hit, grab on to something while the shark attacks anyone which stands in its way!
B0000524E5|3.0|The best part of the movie was the bar.  The music and the dancers made the movie a lot of fun.  I just could not take my eyes off of Cammie (Izabella Miko) -- probably physically the least attractive of the dancers but has a great smile, tons of energy and confidence, and is a very seductive dancer.  I was less enamored with the lead character, Violet (Piper Perabo), a small town girl with big dreams but is afraid to take chances (stage fright??).  I personally found it difficult to root for her character but she is very pretty and innocent and fits into the role very well.  I dug the look on her face after her suitor &quot;Mr. O'Donnell&quot; (Adam Garcia) deadpans, &quot;It's 3 in the morning ... I want what every other man wants now.&quot;  Speaking of Garcia, I thought he did a great job, at least until they neutered his character about 2/3s in.  &quot;I'll fire you Walt!&quot;<br />Overall, when the focus isn't on the bar though, the movie really struggles.  It isn't so much the cliches involved, it's just the writing.  It would have been nice to see Violet gradually gather the confidence needed to succeed from her time at Coyote Ugly and with her friends, to see her gradually develop into a city girl, and naturally reconcile with her father rather than have it all occur spontaneously when the plot demands.  To be honest the plot gave me a headache.  But overall, it's a fun movie if you don't expect much, worth a rental at least.
6303168507|5.0|Spielberg's best film ever.  This is going to become a classic. Liam Neeson is in toip form in this great film which won Best Pictuere and Best director!
B00003CXTF|1.0|In all honesty, I walked out of the movie theatre after 20 minutes of the most cliché, predictable, ridiculous scripting I've ever heard.<br />The previews built this up as a movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor.  What the viewer receives is a drawn out, Titanic-esque, melodramatic romance, with a 'smidgin' of battle to draw attention.  While the battle scenes are impressive, they don't make up for the other two hours of clichéd writing.<br />World War II can be a touchy subject for artists to work with.  While I know that romance abounded during that time (how could it not, with soldiers leaving home and loved ones?), this movie SHOULD have focused more strongly on the battle...or else have the show renamed.<br />If you want a *good* World War II movie, try &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot;, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, or best yet, HBO's &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;.<br />If you want bad romance and melodrama, try Titanic.
B00005QDW5|4.0|with a band that needs no introduction at last a greatest hits package from the mighty pink floyd.with this album it comes across as more of an introduction than an actully greatest hits package or a retrospective album.its more for people who have not gotten into the floyd yet and is aimed mainly for those new folks.  which is not a bad thing of course. but my biggest complaint being an older fan is there are many great songs lacking in this 30 year  history of the band . kind of buypasssing some of there greatest work between 67 and 73 such as =the narrow way part 3=biding my time=if=childhoods end=freefour=have a cigar=cymbiline=green is the colour=and about a hand full of other great songs from that error. but there are many pros of this album for all the floydian fans of years pass such as some great mixing and remastering of the syd barret(a.k.a the 5th member) error of the band having him start and end the cd is a pretty cool tribute.also you get to hear the full version of shine on you crazy diamond cut down and edited into one suite.also the shorter version of the epic song  echoes cut down to a 16 minute version rather  then a 23 minute version seems to work out in the end.also about time the put a song from animals on a compilation the song sheep also cut a little works and gets to the point of the song!! .you also get the unrealised song when the tigers broke free .hey big deal!!!so some day they will realise a better retrospective but until that day some 30 years from now i guess i say to you seddle for this and a must buy for anyone who has never purchased a pink floyd album yet.for you it will be a wonderfull piece of history and music!!!
0385505833|5.0|Mr. Grisham has dipped into the heart of the American psyche and created what is destined to be a future Christmas classic. Laced with wry humour and filled with genuine warmth, Skipping Christmas is a fun read.<br />  I thoroughly enjoyed this delightful short work. and eagerly await a film treatment, as I am sure (if produced true to the writing) it will easily rival &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;.<br />  Congratulations, Mr. Grisham - and thanks for the holiday treat! Especially this year, I needed that.
0385505833|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I found out at once that it was a classic to be cherished forever. Unlike other John Grisham books, this one tells the story of the Kranks. After their daughter goes off to the peace core, they find it hard to have Christmas at all. They oversee the comments made by co-workers and friends, and decide to do the unthinkable. Go on a cruise. No party. No Christmas.<br />  I totally recommend this book because it is unlike any other book I have read. It's funny, yet very realistic. This is a book that I'll read every Christmas!
B00005214X|5.0|This is an excellent solo debut by George Harrison. It shows that even the quiet Beatle has talent of his own. It features the sentimental My Sweet Lord and the excellent what is life. I will recommend this CD to anyone who is a music fan. George we will miss you but we will always have your great music to enjoy . Later Man
B00003CXCQ|4.0|After watching Snow White no less than EIGHTEEN TIMES with my 20 month old I feel as if I am somewhat of an exprert.  Disney has outdone themselves with this masterpiece of a film.  The story is greatly known, although the message that this sends to young women may need some interference from mom and dad but ths movie is timeless in it's good vs evil themes and true love.<br />The DVD extras are quite fun: visit Snow White through the years.  Play Dopey's mine game (well this is a bit dull for adults but the little one loved it), a &quot;Hi-Ho&quot; sing along.  There is also Barbra Striesand belting out &quot;someday My Prince Will Come&quot;.  This is a great DVD to add to your collection and one that will get much play.

B00005K3OT|4.0|I love this movie!  Yes, the story of Vianne as the scandalous new woman in town who changes the lives of the old stuck in thier way villagers is quite predictable but this is a great, excellent, wonderful feel good movie that is best viewed cuddled with your sweety.<br />Alfred Molina deserved an award as the Count whose obsessions with Vianne almost destroys himself and Johnny Depp is hot as ever as Irish river rat Roux.<br />The DVD extras include a &quot;making of&quot;, deleted scenes, the trailed (which in my opinion should not be classified as an extra),  little something about chocolate and a piece about the costumes.<br />This is a great one to own for us time.
0553573403|5.0|Martin Surpasses ALL fantasy writers I have read (and I've read a LOT, including the Big Three: Tolkien, Jordan, and Goodkind...)This series is the tightest, most intelligent and captivating I have ever read. Martin breathes a new sense of literary integrity into what had become a dry and predictible genre. If you love great plots, multi-dimentional and unconventional characters, realistic imagery and dialog, and seamless storytelling, READ THIS SERIES! I don't care what &quot;genre&quot; you like, this will make a fan out of you. It's not just great fantasy... it's great Writing, period.<br />This books sets the stage for what becomes a whirlwind of factions, intrigues, and betrayals. The characters are mostly shades of grey, there is no real &quot;hero&quot; and characters are developed regardless of which side of the fence they're on (actually, there are many sides, and they keep changing!) And don't get too attached, 'cause Martin has no qualms in dispatching characters, even main ones, for the sake of the story. The great thing about this series is that you know that no matter what, the story always takes precedence over the characters, and that's what makes him a truly great story-teller.<br />Another refreshing aspect of this series is the limited and subtle use of magic and &quot;supernatural' elements. Magic, or the ability to weild it, is not thrown about like some &quot;sixth sense&quot; or cure all. It retains its mystery, and because of that is saved from becoming mundane. There are some dragons, but the entire aproach to this typical fantasy staple is unique and in keeping with the reality of the world Martin has created.<br />I think fantasy authors everywhere have a new benchmark to work up to, and I hope this will raise the standard of fantasy writing for a long while. Does it get any better than this? I almost feel guilty reading this series, it's so good. I am wringing my hands in anticipation of the next installment!<br />(One word of caution to those with more prudish sensibilities. The second and third of the series does contain a lot of explicit sex and language. Some think it is in keeping with the integrity of the stories, some believe it is gratuitous and uneccessary. I personaly do not care for explicit scenes in any story, but I feel that it is worth wading through a little mud to get to the gem of a story told in this series.)with more prudish sensibilities.

0440219078|4.0|I gave this star four stars, the book was good but it had something that I didn't like. Author tells us in the book that the life were living in right now is really great. At least we dont have lots of rules to listen too. This book has lots of surprising parts. The bad part in the book is that at first you wont kinda understand, but thats me. Jonas is a great charceter he play a good part in this story. In the beginnig for everyone, they cant see no colors,they cant use the word love, and they cant even pick their own jobs for crying out shake. This book is awesome, I'm really glad that we dont have that community in this world.
0553579908|5.0|George R. R. Martin took over the high fantasy genre and raised the stakes, and the style, to a higher level. The characters are real and dimentional, the lines of good and evil are blurred, and you find yourself wondering, &quot;who is the good guy, anyway?&quot;. He seamlessly connects stories told from different characters' viewpoints into an epic tale with all of the right elements that make you want to emerse yourself into this world. It will change your opinion of what is good fantasy...what is good WRITING in general, and leave you scrambling for the next book as soon as you put the first one down.
0446677450|3.0|This book seems to me to have little new information in it. I enjoyed reading it because it got me thinking about possibilities and I am now researching those possibilities in depth. It seems that most people will come away from this book thinking that you can go buy a bunch of property and get rich. It's actually a little more tricky than that. <br />This book speaks in generalities. If you want an in-depth, how-to book on becoming wealthy this is not it. It is a jumping off point for me. It made me think about my million-dollar idea and how to make it a million dollar reality. I am now looking at authors like John Maxwell, Zig Ziglar, Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill and others to build my skills. <br />This book is good, in that it may inspire you to look at possibilities. If you just need a start, check out Rich Dad, Poor Dad.
0871137380|5.0|In most of the reviews listed, I did not see any of the reviewers place blame for the losses sustained in Mogadishu on the people who caused them.  Once again, the bureaucrats expected a mission to go off without a hitch and had no plan &quot;B&quot; to fall back on.  Only through the courage and dedication of our fighting forces were the lives that were saved made possible.  Furthermore, this book demonstrates that our need for HUMINT is an extremely crucial but much neglected facet of military missions, be they covert or not.  September 11, 2001 is an even better example of our need for an expansion of our HUMINT forces.  Like many others, once I started the book, I was unable to put it down.  I spent an entire, beautifully sunny Saturday reading this book.  I highly recommend this book to everyone who has an interest in our military.  GOD BLESS AMERICA!
B00005ASQ1|3.0|Sean Connery is the enigmatic William Forrester, a brilliant though troubled writer turned recluse after releasing a single literary masterpiece, \\"Avalon Rising\\".  (Famous hermit Salinger published far more - Forrester's literary contributions, beyond his novel, include periodical ramblings to mags like the New Yorker) Fearing attention, Forrester lives under an assumed name in a dessicated apartment, and frustrates those who would survey his work by dangling the prospect of a second book.  Newcomer Rob Brown (supposedly he auditioned for a bit part) is Jamel Wallace, local boy, b-ball maestro and burgeoning writer.  Not recognizing the hermit as Forrester, Jamel nevertheless turns to reclusive scot for help in his writing.  The need becomes more pronounced when Jamel's writing (and his court magic) gets him a scholarship to an upper-crust prep school.  Forrester nurtures Wallace's prose (Write from the heart first, then the head, Forrester advises) while Wallace returns the favor by drawing Wallace out of his shell and preserving the genius's privacy.  While at school, Wallace develops his writing under the eye of the Nefarious Professor Crawford (F. Murray Abraham).  With Crawford's earlier attempt at publishing thwarted by Forrester ages ago, the professor works his anger out by tyrannizing his wimpy students.  To Crawford, a disparity between Jamel's writing and background raises suspicions.  Jamel's refusal to conform only spurs Crawford further until the vindictive teacher can show a pattern between Jamel's writing and obscure works by Forrester.<br />Though Director Gus Van Sant gets some good work from his leads, quality performances and deft direction don't rise above a thin and trite story.  We know that Forrester hides in his shell for a reason and that Wallace will find someway to ease his pain.  We also know that a confrontation between the evil Crawford and Wallace is inevitable.  Crawford is incredibly underwritten, like the villain of some action movie - you know he's going to get what's coming to him.  He's a bitter bully and a coward.  Worse is the school, the sort of stuffy place of learning we've seen in \\"Dead Poets Society\\" and \\"Scent of a Woman\\", the sort of tradition-bound citadel ruled by old money and populated by craven white males.  (The school falls even below this standard - though on academic probation, the school avails itself of Jamel's court skills, and even dangles the prospect of a reprieve, and you've got to wonder what respectable establishment would tolerate as openly a tyrannical, apparently bigoted and not obviously unsuccessful figure like Crawford).  The story doesn't do anything to beef up the school, which is populated by weasels cowering before the faculty.  There are none of the priceless supporting characters you had in \\"Good Will Hunting\\", and Busta-Rhymes is wasted as Jamel's older brother.  Though the film is about writing, the script barely treats itself as such, and there are only few lines with Forrester and Jamel jousting on the craft of prose and narrative.  I'd suggest \\"Wonderboys\\" instead.

B000002UAU|2.0|This is an o.k. album for its type and time,but great it ain't.Aside from &quot;with a little help from my friends&quot; and &quot;when i'm 64&quot;(very kool and kooky instrumentation)this album sounds so much like a lot of other trippy-dippy nonsense and pompousness of the late 60's.&quot;Lucy in the sky with diamonds&quot;-what exactly is that supposed to mean?I guess if its vague it must be &quot;deep&quot;.So reason most people.I just don't get the whole Beatles thing.What's so great about them?Their music is catchy but catchy doesn't mean the music is great.Their music relied a lot on gimmicky sound manipulation and singing of subjects that the masses never get tired of lapping up like the taste deprived nitwit-philistines they are.I can see prepubescents and old hippies who never developed mental faculties beyond that of a 12 year old liking this music,but grown people who actually like this music are either severely taste deprived or are in need of listening to real music like Chopin,Duke Ellington,Debussy,Bach or any number of real composers.Life is too short and there is so much truly great music out there to explore to waste time on these highly overrated pop schlocksters whom by the way wrote music solely for the money and even thought of their own fans as a bunch of screaming,squealing morons.Not that they were wrong in that regard!
B000005XKO|5.0|I believe that this is a movie that suits kids of all ages.  I am in my 20's and I still absolutely love this movie. I think that parents should show this movie to their kids atleast once in their lifetime so they can see first hand on what it used to be like in the world.  &quot;Two thumbs up&quot; I have to say.
B000002UAU|2.0|Test yourself; sing as much of this album as you can, and then Magical Mystery Tour.  The latter is much stronger, with several more memorable tunes, and sounds fresher today.  A good bit of Sgt. Pepper's is too cutesy and novelty doesn't wear well.  Ground breaking at the time?  Sure.  But that was then and this is now.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Ok we have to face it, Britney doesnt have the best voice ever but she CAN sing and there is no way around that. I saw her in concert and it was absoutley awesome, if you saw her in concert you would never question Britneys poularity.But i am sure most of you wont be going to a britney concert. Maybe people are scared to say they like this album because it is Brintey Spears, but if you get past that fact and just sit down and enjoy this album I think you will. I am not a huge Britney fan but this album converted me. it has slammin beats, awesome lyrics, danceable tunes, and one beatiful ballad, what else can you look for in an album? Even if you refuse to by it, could you atleast download it? I think Britney atleast deserves a listen, let the music grow on you I can almost gaurantee it will. Another issue why peopl might not want this albm is because of hw Britney dresses. First do you think she goes around on a reguar day dressed like that? NO. But it is part of her image to look sexy on stage, she is growing up and experimenting with her looks.<br />I know my review might not matter to anyone ut if you do here are the top songs<br />1. I love rock n roll- This is definetly Britneys best cover to date, The drummer in the band that wrote this song is a good friend of my dads, I let him have a listen and he loves it.<br />2. I'm not a girl, not yet a woman- Some people are calling this song cheesy but dont think is cheesy at all. This is a song all teenage girls can relate to. Britneys voice is actually retty good on this song.<br />3. Lonely- This is a song you ca sing along to anytime, It has an awesome beat and words you can understand and sing along to, I LOVE this song its one of the albums best, and she wrote it to!!<br />4. Overprotectd- This song souds a little to much like lonely but its still awesome anyway this will make you get up and dance. She didnt write this one.<br />5. Anticipating- This is an 80's pop song, I have to admit it does sound a little like the spice girls just a little. She wrote this one. Its pretty good, Its about going out with your friends to a club just listen, it grows on you.<br />6.Boys- This song has an awesome beat. The words aren the most appropriate but if you get pastthe words the song is pretty awesome, although some people wont like it as much as me.
630588255X|4.0|I show this movie to my students. We all laugh at Maude's illegal antics, but at who's expense? Is Maude a heroine, or simply a self-absorbed hedonist? Can we condone what she does? Any movie that causes you to question is meeting one of the requirements of art. It gets a little long at times, but overall, it's a worthwhile movie.
0393312836|5.0|This book is very interesting form the first page until the last. The author jumps right into the story and gets his readers hooked. The strongest aspect of this book is the appeal of the story line. The other elements that contribute to the books sucess are foreshadowing, different dialects and the strong characters. This book uses language that is unique to it and while it is a little hard to follow in the early pages soon the slangs used are easily rembered. Also the well developed characters add a new dimension to the book.<BR> This book intrests, appalls, and stuns all at once. The actions of the narrator and his frinds are often so extremely violent it's sickening. The concept that is the hardest to swallow is how the characters of the book could act so horribly. The book takes a deeper look at what youth is coming to. All the extreme actions that are taken all to entertain this young man through out the book takes a good hard look at the narrators psyche. This book is not a light afternoon read, it is an intense disgusting and intriguing well written piece of literature.
6304806426|5.0|&quot;The English Patient&quot; is one of the finest movies of our century. It combines all of the aspects and genre of contemporary and classic film. The acting is superb, the cinemotagrahpy is wonderful, and the story is that of deep and heartfelt emotion. I recommend this to anyone interested in obtaining the depth and magnitude of the world created in &quot;The English Patient&quot;.
0517122707|5.0|In his book &quot;On Writing&quot;, Stephen King's advice to aspiring writers is not to focus so much on plot or theme, but on creating characters that act true to themselves, and the plot will basically write itself. &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, I believe, does just that. The strength of this book is in its characters, and as they interact, the plot develops in an often hilarious fashion. There are enough &quot;minor&quot; characters to rival the cast of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and they all have their quirks and eccentricities. There is Mancusco, the disgraced policeman who is forced to patrol wearing absurd costumes and disguises. There is the jive-talking Jones, trying to keep one step ahead of the law by working at sub-minimum wage in a seedy dive. There is Darlene who has the &quot;bright&quot; idea of performing a striptease act with a trained cockatoo, with disastrous results. There is Miss Trixie, a senile secretary still waiting for her Christmas ham. There is the henpecked CEO of Levy Pants, who is content to let the company run itself much to the chagrin of his shrewish wife. These characters and many more populate the universe of this expert novel.<br />The character around which this whole universe revolves is Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius cannot fully be described, only experienced. An overweight slob with the vocabulary of an elite snob, Ignatius is at the same time a reactionary and a revolutionary, decidedly out of place in the 20th century, a man with a &quot;unique world view&quot;, writing out his manifesto on an endless supply of Big Chief Tablets. Ignatius is usually screaming at almost everything, especially his tippling mother, but also at the dancers on an &quot;American Bandstand&quot;-type show and the actors on the movie screen. His entrance into the job market, as a file clerk who refuses to file and a hot-dog vendor who eats most of the product himself, his botched attempts at political organization, and his obsessive disgust with his &quot;girlfriend&quot; in New York make for a character the likes of which is previously unknown in all of literature. <br />Reviewer have called this a great comic novel, which I feel is shortchanging this book quite a bit. It's a great novel, period.
B000000OMB|5.0|This is one of those discs that I've played often for the last fifteen years and I hear something new with each listen.  Asia was four individual virtuosos from mostly prog-rock backgrounds who came together to play pop/rock with a decidedly progressive feel.  The result of this debut was stunning.  Not only are the songs top-notch, but the playing and singing are absolutely mindblowing.  Check out the vocal harmonies on Time Again and Without You, the energy of Wildest Dreams, the dreamy and unexpected ending of Without You, and the sublime piano outro of Cutting It Fine.  This piano part could be an entire separate song or theme for a movie, it's so beautiful.  Also, Steve Howe's guitar and John Wetton's superb singing are standouts throughout the entire disc (not to mention Carl Palmer's drumming).<br />ASIA definately starts out in a pop/rock vein with the first two tracks being the AOR radio hits.  Heat of the Moment is actually the weakest of all the cuts, in my opinion, although it's still a great song.  Only Time Will Tell, however, is one of the best on the album in spite of the fact that it's one of the least adventurous--the melody and orchestration are just incredible.  After these two cuts, the album takes on a more progressive sound, while still having it's roots in rock.  Key changes, outside harmony, and adventurous interludes abound in track three through the end.  This disc is a must for any musician or rock fan and it's a shame that the first two tracks are the only ones familiar to most people.
B00005U122|5.0|I agree with the other 5 star reviews.  The DVD's not out--I haven't seen it.  I saw Waters play IN THE FLESH in L.A. and Mountain View, No. California.  Both shows were phenominal.  It took two lead guitarists to fill Gilmours shoes but after both solo'd during &quot;Another Brick in The Wall Part 2&quot; I knew they were for real.  The highlight of the show for me was the bands 17 minute rendition of &quot;Dogs.&quot; Perhaps the best concert I've ever seen, even beating out Waters &quot;Radio Chaos&quot; tour 12 years earlier.  A must have for any Roger Waters/Pink Floyd fan.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Awesome.  Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances by any actor.  Robert Zemeckis is brilliant.  Great score.  A good sense of humor as well. <BR>One of my all time favorites.<br />[...]
B0000027RL|5.0|I remember when Pearl Jam was a band. On \\"Ten\\" you could tell they were a group of musicians who wrote their songs by jamming. After this album they became The Eddie Vedder Experience. For a band that showed unlimited promise, it all went downhill from here. But when you consider the album that this is, there was no other direction to go.
6302816580|3.0|This film is by far the most unknown of all time......but also a great idea from a superb director......who thought a film about arm wrestling would have been so unpopular??   Stallone is brilliant as a crazy truck driving arm wrestling hulk of a man.<BR>A good script gives this film a great rating

B000009ED0|4.0|Raunchy, hilarious, a total blast. For those who appreciate low humor and high volume, this is one of the more fun discs in recent memory. This is the type of CD that you may forget you have after six months - but mainly because you played it to death for the first three.<br />While the first several glances suggest that he is not someone to be taken seriously, the fact remains that no one has fused rock and rap as successfully as Kid Rock. More listenable than Rage, more legit than Limp Bizkit, and as lyrically fun as anyone out there, Kid is a talented performer. He has an ear for great riffs, a penchant for clever lyrics, and an attitude that suggests he has found his true calling in life. <br />The disc runs the gamut from metallic and nonsensical (&quot;Bawitdaba&quot;) to the pop and wickedly clever (&quot;Cowboy&quot;) to the funky and openly bitter (&quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot;) - and that's just the first three songs. While several of the later tracks are less exceptional, the whole CD is fun and definitely worth the while.
0790729741|5.0|My son is 7 and he usually watches a dvd once and has no interest in watching it again.  Not with this movie!  He watches it over and over again and really enjoys it.
B00004XPQ2|5.0|This isn't another more war movie but one of the most difficult to fully understand and truly superb.<BR>Colonel Saito direct the prisoners camp. He doesn't understand the war moral of the English and American prisoners owing to his surrendering. He thinks they aren't men but only trash. But English colonel Nicholson represents another view of professional military life. Saito thinks he's soft and coward, but this is false: Nicholson has a puritan ethics that wins finally. Otherwise the Japanese experts are unable to build the bridge and Nicholson wants to collaborate because he conceives these work at first only as a task to preserve the moral of his men because escape it's impossible in the jungle... except for the strong resolute soldier played by William Holden. But the stiffness of so many years of military command and surely the accumulated penalties of the war undermines the reason of Nicholson and he gets too much involved with the bridge and so, in clear treason by full collaboration with the enemy although he's unconscious of that until the attack of the commandos to blow all the works. It seems that the madness of Nicholson has something of contagious and his men obey him without discussion. Only the English physician is astonished by all the nonsense. <BR>  But for me, the most disturbing personage in this film is curiously a relatively secondary one: the chief of commandos played by Jack Hawkins, because he's an scholar from Cambridge, but -as the lively Holden understands- he has a strange drive towards death: explosive management, weapons and a taste for destruction being a cultivated man. One of the best films of all themes and all time.
0790729628|5.0|The director's cut of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is definitely an improvement over the already-fine version that was originally released to theaters.  When one finally sees it without the tacked-on voice-overs, which were added by the studio to make it easier to understand and supposedly to give it more of a film noir quality, it becomes clear that the film's visuals are totally capable of conveying the story on their own -- and watching the film is much more enjoyable when we are allowed to interpret the action ourselves.  In addition, there is now more evidence that Deckard may be a replicant himself, a notion I scoffed at before but now see as an element that makes the film much richer thematically.  A new sequence which shows Deckard dreaming of a unicorn gives the ending (Deckard finds a small origami unicorn in the hallway outside his apartment as he and Rachel begin their escape) added resonance that is lacking in the original version, in which the voice-over narration actually detracts from the film's meaning.  Missing from the director's cut is the tacked-on happy ending showing Deckard and Rachel happily cruising north in his flying car as he explains that Rachel's lifespan is unlimited, unlike that of the other replicants.  The film now ends as it should, with the two entering the elevator and the door closing abruptly to leave the screen black for the credits to roll, allowing us to wonder what will become of the fugitive lovers as we ponder the mystery of whether or not Deckard himself is a replicant.  Something to look for in both versions -- Gaff's (Edward James Olmos) origami creations (chicken, person, unicorn) always convey his feelings at the time, and as the film progresses we see him develop a grudging respect for Deckard, until at last he says to him &quot;You've done a man's job, sir&quot; -- the ultimate compliment to bestow upon a replicant.
B00005M989|3.0|When he's good he's really, really good; but when he's bad he's boring as all get out.<br />There was a time--it's hard to recall now, but I swear this is true--there was a time when Prince was on a plane with Michael Jackson and Madonna, artistically, creatively, and commercially.  But at some point, somewhere around the time he went through all that silliness about using a self-created rune in place of the name moniker which he'd already used to replace his given name, the commercial bottom dropped out.  His creative fires have cooled a bit in recent years too, though I would argue that he's a better musician and more of an artist than Madonna has been or MJ could even dream of being.<br />I would also argue that this is NOT a &quot;Best of&quot; package, as it claims to be, but a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package.  There is a difference.
B00005QZWI|4.0|Adequate soundtrack albums perform the function of providing music which hightens the emotions of the viewer and supports the story of the film.  Good soundtracks also include at least one nice melody that can be enjoyed apart from viewing the film.  Truly great soundtracks, typified by the work of the greatest contemportary composers like Williams and Horner, have several of these stand alone melodies, often themes that follow certain characters or situations.  Shore's LOTR soundtrack has several memorable themes, but do not quite rise to the level of greatness.  They are often deeply imbeded in the more &quot;random&quot; soundtrack segments, or at other times become overly repetitious    In addition, the theme in &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; and &quot;Many Meetings&quot; seems to be an almost exact copy of the old hymn &quot;This Is My Father's World&quot;  That being said, the soundtrack will likely fit perfectly with the images and action on the screen and conveys much of the mystery and grandeur of Middle Earth.
6305908648|3.0|Sorry, I am a fan of the original Deep Purple from the days of Ritchie Blackmore and &quot;Made in Tokyo&quot; live album, or Machine Head style of playing... if this is your expectations, this video of a more recent incarnation of Deep Purple will let you down.  They are not the same group as the early 1970's Deep Purple.  I am not a hard core Deep Purple fanatic that will blindly like and worship anything labled &quot;Deep Purple&quot;.  I want and prefer the original bands material.  So this DVD was a let down to me. It may not be for you.
B000000W8C|5.0|There are few albums which elicit the response in me that Northern Soul does. I find it impossible to put this CD into the player without listening all the way through. The emotional range, both lyrically and musically, is difficult to match with other bands- in a time when America was embracing grunge and Britain was enthralled with the up and coming Oasis, The Verve put out what to me is one of the best albums of the '90s. <br />Somehow Verve manages to intermingle pain and joy, exploring all of what it is to be alive and to feel. The high point, in my mind, of the Verve's discography. The closest anything has come since has been Spiritualized's &quot;Live at Royal Albert Hall&quot; and The Doves &quot;Lost Souls&quot;. <br />If you were buying one BritPop album, I would recommend this one.

0451169514|5.0|For me, a good book is one whereby the story grips me from the start and doesn't let go. In IT, from the very first page describing the death of George Denbrough's brother to the fast-paced (but a little weak) ending, this book grips you. Some people complain about the levels of sex, gore, violence, etc. (a warning to the easily offended), but for me it just enhances the reality of the book.<BR>The second great part of this book is the attention to detail (1000+ pages worth), and the myriad of sub-plots ranging from boys lighting their farts on fire to dam building 101. Some say the sub-plots detract from the effectiveness of the book, but in my opinion the sub-plots actually enhance the story and help immerse the reader in Derry, Maine circa 1958<BR>For someone just starting to read Stephen King, I would not recommend this book. Start with a book like Pet Sematary (his best book ever), and get used to his style of writing. Many people are offended by the contents of IT because they haven't read any other books by Stephen King.<BR>A great read. No joke, when I was done I wished it were longer...
0446677450|3.0|It's not even that the book itself is not that good, but more or less, all it's really gonna' tell you is to acquire &quot;as many assets as possible, with as few liabilities as possible&quot; only through a series of stories, examples, and longwinding explanations of the world that at times seem so abstract your not even sure if this guy lives in the same world as you.  I guess it's a Hawaiian thing, but then again, so is pinapple on Pizza.  Bottom line, what I said in 11 words, he's gonna' tell you in about 10,000, and my advice was free, where as if you order off this website, it's going to cost you a lot more than it is worth, so just take it from me...assets not liabilities, and read something else...I hear the emperor's of chocalate isn't bad!
0783226063|5.0|Well, you may nitpick this DVD with &quot;weak blacks&quot;, etc., etc., but the bottom line is that if you watch the VHS and then slap in the DVD, you'll notice about a 500% difference in clarity and sharpness.

B000002BHE|1.0|I've never been a fan of Celine Dion but I was surprised at how uniformly bad this CD is. Some of the songs might be reasonably good sung by someone else, but this woman has the ability of turning everything she touches into the worst kind of syrupy schlock. This has to be the most pretentious, overblown and ultimately ridiculous thing I've heard in a long time. Miss Dion has a very powerful voice and she can certainly carry a tune, but she doesn't know the meaning of the word subtlety, and that is essential for a singer. Despite all her wailing she doesn't manage to convey any feeling at all. This woman can scream all right, but she can't sing.

B00003CXZ4|2.0|My wife and I rented this movie and were really engrossed by the story.  The writing, directing and acting are superb.  However, I gave the movie two stars.  <br />Why?  There is no representation of good in this film.  <br />Just when I felt that one of the characters was trying to be helpful and selfless the story flips back a scene and their motivations are painted more clearly.  Everyone is exploiting everyone else.  I'm not bothered by this from a moral point of view so much.  What bothered me was that I found it difficult to sleep after watching this film.  <br /> (...)

B00005LC1H|5.0|Comedy has always been a strange facet of human entertainment: a method in which the flaws of one's self - or the follies of mankind in general - are exposed and subsequently reduced by a knowing chuckle; the pain and suffering of miscommunication transformed into a cathartic moment of release.  Just as laughter is essential to the health and constitution, comedy can be an essential vehicle to gain insight into misfortune, to understand and perhaps overcome those same redundancies/patterns which plague the waking life.<br />Turn on the boob-tube on any given \\"prime-time\\" night and the options for said release are near limitless: a thousand and one situational comedies vying for your attention (and commercial dollar, of course).  But are any really worth the time spent? Given the plethora of recycled motifs - unresolved sexual tension, slapstick excess, emotional estrangement, miscommunication in extremity - do any of these time-worn human-flaw laugh-triggers produce more than a hollow snicker? It really depends on the quality of the script and the dedication of the actors, the competency of the men behind the camera and the synergy of the crew as a whole to produce something fresh and uniquely expressive from human angst.  Few comedies, in my opinion, succeed in this regard: year after year, the bulk of Hollywood output is a case of diminishing returns.  But then again, Los Angeles is not quite the cultural center is pretends to be, now is it?<br />In the late 1970's, John Cleese of Monty Python fame assembled a crack team of artists for an interesting variation on the situational comedy theme.  Based around the neurotic, perpetually grumpy hotel owner Basil Fawlty (played by Cleese), _Fawlty Towers_ is a heady blend of slapstick, misinterpretation and emotional overload, with impeccable timing and flat-out brilliant dialogue.  Comedy rarely gets better than this.<br />The episodes:<br />The Builders - Basil's \\"need for the cheap\\" comes on strong when the hotel needs repairs.  Naturally he goes for the lowest bidder for the job, behind his wife Sybil's back no less, with disastrous hijinks as a result.<br />The Wedding Party - The Heat is in the air one summer night, and Basil, guardian of British upper-crust morals, seeks to put a lid on the brimming sexual tension run rampant in the hotel...only to get caught in several compromising positions himself.<br />The Psychiatrist - When a psychiatrist comes to stay at Fawlty Towers, Basil goes out of his way to avoid the good doctor, subconsciously aware of his own unsteady sanity... all the while exposing his deepest anxieties and inconsistencies as he seeks to evict a (hilariously portrayed) debonair guest for \\"loose conduct.\\"<br />Hotel Inspectors - Basil Fawlty has a low tolerance for tourists of any kind.  After an extreme bout of rudeness to a pretentious guest, Basil bends over backwards trying to make amends with what he thinks is a hotel inspector...and, upon discovering his error, will do anything to enact revenge upon the poor individual.<br />The Germans - After a slight concussion, Basil acts crazier than ever, and his unfortunate German guests must bear the brunt for some deep-seated post-war resentments.<br />A Touch of Class - One of my favorites.  Basil Fawlty is the consummate snob, spitting poison at the `lower class' guests while fawning all over those with the slightest title and/or bearing.  But what happens when his snobbery is taken for a ride by a confidence trickster? Many laughs, I assure you...<br />Gourmet Night - Fawlty Towers' first Gourmet Night seems to have everything going for it: a professional chef, the cream of Torque society, an eager Basil to genuflect and bootlick...yet events to not proceed as planned...<br />Waldorf Salad - An obnoxious American guest stops by Fawlty Towers, receives an eyeful of Basil's inconsistent managing style, and proceeds to \\"lay it on the line\\" with the gangly Brit.<br />The Kipper and the Corpse - a guest dies inhis sleep and Basil runs himself (and the rest of the staff) ragged trying to conceal it from the other guests.  Probably the best tension-building episode of them all.<br />Communication Problems - Mrs. Hinderson is deaf and doesn't use her hearing aide because `it runs the batteries down.'  She and Basil are like oil and water, with a flame about to touch down...<br />The Anniversary - In his typical cruel fashion, Basil pretends to forget his anniversary with Sybil, all the while planning an elaborate surprise party.  But the joke is on him when Sybil stalks out and he must cater to his incoming guests...<br />Basil the Rat - Hands down my favorite of them all.  Spanish waiter Manuel has a pet `Siberian Hamster' that sends Basil into conniption fits upon discovery.  With a Hotel Inspector having already put a black mark on Fawlty Towers, this particular pet must be stashed away before the hotel is closed down for good...and when the furry little fellow disappears, all chaos breaks out in consequence.<br />If you are a fan of British humor in general and sophisticated comedies in particular, do yourself a favor: pick up this rare pinnacle of entertainment.  You won't be disappointed.

0156012197|3.0|When shakespeare sat down to write Romeo and Juliet he didn't say, &quot;well, lets write a play about how love is stronger than death&quot;. Had he done that he wouldn't have produced Romeo and Juliet since he would be too preoccupied with getting his &quot;deep message&quot; across (so deep that it can be expressed in a sentence ... ), instead of writing a good play. Saint-Exupery did the exact opposite - it is evident that this book was written as some sort of philosophical manifesto on how adults do not appreciate life enough, as children do. The characters and plot are all secondary to that idea. The reader is reminded at every turn of this &quot;deep message&quot;, the end result being that the message and the book become vulgar, over-used, &quot;in-your-face&quot;. It personally bothered me a lot (and isn't this review personal, after all?). I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 because Saint-Exupery obviously had a great talent for conjuring up lovely scenes - such as the famous one in which the prince asks him to draw him a sheep. But these scenes cannot act as an excuse to the endless preachings of this book. Did the author really give so little credit to his potential readers while writing this? ...
B000000Y2F|5.0|This CD is great.  It's one of the best I have ever listened to.  Two of the most ingenious musicians in the history of jazz, on one recording.  Buy this CD!
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Communique is a very &quot;blue&quot; album(not only considering the cover), the songs are melancholy and often a depiction of cynical personas. The album got a beautiful sound and a sense of contiunity in the melodies, it is in my view a very harmonic album. Mark Knopflers moody vocal and crispy guitar make a perfect balance. Even though the album does not contain any classics like Dire Straits did, I would, as a whole consider it a better album. Right from the &quot;fresh&quot; start of Once Upon a Time in the West and to the slow closing track Follow Me Home it is a perfect and harmonic album, released before they became a &quot;stadium event&quot;.
B000000W3G|5.0|ever.<br />this box set is of their mellon collie b-sides and the best of those is the 1979 and the 33 singles.  they're wonderful.  and this box is wonderful.  excellent covers on their bullet single.  and really good rock on their zero single.  i'd suppose each single has a theme to it, especially the tonight, tonight single, which is soft and sad.<br />you will love it.  claire promises.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|The 1985 release of Brothers in Arms proved to be the breakthrough for Dire Straits, and hovered them to superstardom and stadiums all over the world, with megahits like Money for Nothing, Walk of Life and the title track. The album is less eccentric than their earlier releases and thus more streamlined. Even though this is their ultimately best known album and it is a brilliant one, I would still not consider it their best album, but it is by all means good, and would serve great as an introduction to Dire Straits
B000007T1M|5.0|What every other Nu Metal band has done wrong, System of a Down has done right. They can rock heavy next to anyone on the scene today as anyone who'se seen them live can attest. They do NOT sound just like KoRn or Limp Bizkit or the Deftones or any of the cookie cutter bands that have been cloned from them. System utilizes middle eastern scales and vocal styles in heavy metal unlike...well...anyone else. My point is it sounds good. Go buy it. Now.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|Love Over Gold represents quite varied assortment of songs, from the low mutterings on Telegraph Road and Private Investigations to the fast singing on Industrial Disease. The album starts out with the monster track Telegraph Road, that stretches on for almost 15 minutes, despite the length of the track it does not leave you with the impression of an &quot;overlong&quot; track. This is a different sound than Dire Straits or Communique showed, but the change is a good one none the less.
B00003CXC7|5.0|The definition of a classi in any genre is something in which you can come back to again and again and not get tired of and in which you can still find new and exciting things. Rear Window is one of those films. I saw the restored print of this film when it was released in theaters about a year ago, and was totally engrossed. The thing is I had seen this film several times before, yet it doesnt grow stale.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Not many would have predicted Dire Straits rise to superstardom in 1978, the band had a hard time even finding a label that would release their music. It is lucky that some executive took the chance and released this selftitled album. The sound is very different, crisp guitars, blues rythms and rock mixed. The whole album is marked by the incredibly proficient Mark Knopfler in the lead. <BR>The album always have a soothing effect on me, and the rythms are great to make you relax. The album contains what is today considered classics, like Sultans of Swing and Down to the Waterline. Despite this great debut, Dire Straits did not really hit it off untill the release of Brothers in Arms that really skyrocketed their careers into superstardom. If you like Brothers in Arms, chances are that you will most likely like this album too, and hear where it all started.
B00003CXTG|4.0|I have just finished watching Pearl Harbor.  All through the movie I could not believe that I listened to the critics and did not see this on the big screen.  I heard that there was too much romance and not enough action.  I am sitting here full of emotion seeing one of the most inspiring movies of all time.  I watched courage, strength, honor, and great movie making.  It was scenic, beautiful, electrifying.  I was up moving around because the action was explosive and full of energy.  I felt there was just about enough of everything to make this a wonderful movie.  My hat is off and I salute to great entertainment.  I come away feeling strength of purpose, after I whipped away tears from my eyes.  I give this my four star rating.
B000002L9J|5.0|Music that you will listen to every day of your entire life.
B00003CXDD|5.0|First let me say I love this movie, the music, and the sheer fun of it.  Sure its age begins to show with outdated special effects, but so what -- the movie is excellent. I read a few other reviewers speak negatively about this movie saying that its a Tolkien wanna-be... and I say, so what? At some point every movie aspires to be like greatness, and there is nothing wrong with that either.  This movie has it all, comedy, action, and a well-woven story and soundtrack to make it a wonderful film that all ages, men and women, can enjoy.
B00005OM5L|5.0|The Hyde Park concert presented in this DVD was recorded during the From the Cradle tour and released a couple of years ago on VHS.  Coming from the MTV Unplugged success Clapton opted for a return to its blues roots playing  blues standards as well as modern blues songs among other rock tunes. The results are spotless with Clapton and the band in top form. To note, Clapton concerts through the 90's until the present time are quite an experience as he has teamed with the best musicians in the business. This concert is no exception.<br />The set features some great Clapton signature songs and covers as I Shot the Sheriff, Badge, Five Long Years and others. The DVD set does not add much to the VHS release as there are no extras on it. The sound both stereo and Dolby Digital is very good.
B00003CXA3|5.0|In my humble opinion, one of the best movies ever made.  The criminal (Fernando Rey) is cooler than either of the cops, there is the obligatory stomach-churning chase sequence, everything feels slightly early-70's not-quite-glues-together and out of focus, the main character is a brown 1970 Lincoln Continental Mark 3 and you have the most overbearing, maniacal, evil-hearted director of the last 50 years (Freikin) presiding over the whole thing. A supremely satisfying movie experience from any angle your heart desires.<BR>     There are several other films that surpass French Connection in one way or another, but this film is truly one of the greats. In my opinion there are only a select few movies (Kane, Godfather I, Nashville, Raging Bull, perhaps a few others) that do better than this one.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I purchased this CD before I ever saw the movie out of curiosity as it had become the #1 CD in Amazon sales a few months ago. I found it very well produced and very insight full on folk and country roots. Most of the artist on the record where completely unknown to me but the music was top class and very well interpreted. The performances motivated me to go out and research both the artist and their music.<br />Then I saw the movie on DVD and I was completely blown away by how well the music and the movie go together. It seems like the movie was built around the songs and this gave the record a whole new angle into which appreciate it. The songs give the righ tone and mood to the scenes and are key to the story development.<br />I strongly recomend to experience both the movie and the soundtrack in order appreciate these masterpices.
B00004T0PZ|5.0|Back in the days immediately after the attacks of 9/11, National Public Radio began asking well known musical types what music they thought Americans should be listening to.  They never got around to asking me, but this was my choice.  It still is.    Skies of America is a very moving, very poignant, powerful work for symphony orchestra with solo interludes on this recording from Ornette.  The hustle and bustle of daily life in America, as portrayed by the winds and percussion, contrasted by the ethereal, eternal nature of the skies above, as portrayed by the strings, brings tears to my eyes every time I listen to this album.  The work as a whole is broken down into titled sections.  Those with titles like \\"The Military\\" or \\"The Silver Screen\\" can sound chaotic, aggressive and confounding.  Other sections like \\"Birthdays and Funerals\\", \\"Love Life\\" or \\"Sunday in America\\" feature music for strings that is simply breathtaking in its beauty.  I find it difficult not to be affected by music of such a strong, emotional character.      It's a scandal that Ornette has never been recognized as a symphonic composer. Skies of America really belongs in modern classical repertoire.  It eloquently speaks of a love for country far beyond the sort of militaristic nationalism we see all too often in public life.
078401213X|4.0|You should definitely agree that it's one of those great movies at a very low price. And it's not all that featureless. There's a small 'behind-the-scenes' type segment, where you get to meet most of the crew behind the movie, production notes, and notes on pi itself (to give you a better perspective on concept). There's also two commentary tracks (Darren and Sean), which are namely what stand out most of the features. You can't go wrong with commentary tracks on low-budget movies. They're just so entertaining.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|What Aronofsky has managed to put together in this visual assault on the psyche is nothing short of phenomenal--and disturbingly surreal. Tracking the progressively degenerative lives of four drug abusing individuals, Requiem for a Dream precedes the so-called requiem with an outright rape of the viewer's senses. In the path to destruction, we learn that the seemingly benign can often be the most damaging--Ellen Burstyn's triumphant performace as Harry Goldfarb's mother, Sarah--as in her vitriolic descent to hell via the innocent use of inocuous diet pills. Joining her along the path to center Earth is her son Harry, his best friend (played stoutly by a well-casted Marlon Wayans), and Harry's ex-Bourgeousie girlfriend.<br />Aronofsky adeptly visualizes the repetition of habitual drug use through stylistic sequences that promptly package the actual act itself. What is left is the trivialization of harcore drug abuse wrapped tightly in skilled editing room techniques; Aronofsky drives the effect home by nifty camera work and slick visuals. Most symbolic is Harry and his girlfriend sharing a moment in bed as Aronofsky uses a simple split-window montage to demonstrate the isolation and distance that figuratively divides the two characters. The stylized scene is quickly subdued by the ensuing tension created by the crafty camera shot, and what is left is pure pathos.<br />The final 15 minutes of RFAD make the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan seem so distant and irrelevant, as if the emotional and physical damage imposed by drugs far outstrips the destruction whatever bomb or mortar shell can inflict.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Brave New World is a must for any Maiden fan.  It as good or better then any Maiden album in the past 10 years.  20 years from now it will be compared to Number of the Beast, Killers, and any other Maiden album and rate just as high, if not higher.
B000005DQR|5.0|Rich, imaginative and with occasional funny moments that's Entroducing.  I get a cosmopolitan view listening to what is contained herein - urban grooves, masterful editing - there is so much one can't narrow it down to one or two elements. DJ Shadow's Entroducing brings a confluence of themes, varied beats and deejay effects which underscore spiritual depth of music in general but that simultaneously brings appreciation for this  real music that stands on its own.
B00003CY0V|4.0|Swordfish is not a gratuitous pornograhpy by any means.  It is a graphic cyberthriller, not geared towards yuppie adults. Yes there are scene of adult content, but only one shot reveals anything and it is so brief its hardly worth the mention. However rightwing religious psychopaths wouldn't like the movie at all, to violent, yet within the realm of the possible, just barely. And the ending is great.

B00003CXTG|1.0|Greetings,<br />If those who state that \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is a good film, they need to see such great war films as \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" \\"Platoon,\\" \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" or \\"Tora, Tora, Tora.\\" Even lesser war films such as \\"Casualties of War,\\" \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" and even \\"Hamburger Hill\\" are far better films than \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"<br />As Roger Ebert wrote, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is the story of how the Japanese launched an attack on an American love triangle.<br />I've read other customers who've posted their opinions that this film is historically accurate. Really?<br />It was more fantasy than reality.<br />First of all, a \\"Titanic\\" it's not. \\"Titanic\\" is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it makes for good popcorn entertainment.<br />By comparison, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is flat-out awful.<br />Furthermore, the love story is implausible. And the characters are wooden, the dialogue flat and forgettable.<br />The film doesn't even deal with the fact that Roosevelt knew the Japanese were going to attack Pearl Harbor, but withheld that information so America would have a reason to enter World War II.<br />The characterization of the soldiers and Roosevelt is pure romantic melodrama. <br />The characterization of the Japanese soldiers is one-dimensional and full of stereotypical and racial caricatures and cliches.<br />The historical arguments aside, the film is full of sugary, dumbed down reality as it borrows from a glut of action-war films such as \\"Top Gun.\\"<br />The ending insults anyone with intelligence, going for a rah-rah happy ending (the raid on Tokyo) rather than just ending the film soon after the Pearl Harbor attack.<P(...)P>Veterans of World War II and those soldiers and citizens who experienced the attack at Pearl Harbor should be upset that these money-grubbing filmmakers used the tragedy that is Pearl Harbor as a dimly painted background for the film, ignoring those who suffered and died that day.<br />By comparison, despite the weaknesses of \\"Titanic,\\" the filmmaker made sure to make the viewers feel the pain, tragedy and sense of loss emanating from the sinking of the ship.<br />But watching \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" I felt none such emotion.  The film wasn't even about \\"Pearl Harbor.\\" It was about some childhood friends who fall in love with the same nurse and their good ol' love triangle is interrupted by the Japanese military. <br />The movie makes it seem like the Japanese military's main act was breaking up the love triangle.<br />At least the filmmakers of \\"Titanic\\" were smart enough to avoid such a display.<br />\\"Pearl Harbor\\" is going to sell tons of DVDS and videotapes because it's dumbed down, watered down fluff. And fluff sells.<br />If you want to see good World War II films, there are many to choose from. Start with \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\" which is very historically accurate, showing both the American and Japanese perspectives on the war.<br />(and my last point, remember, that there was a large community of Americans of Japanese descent living in Hawaii at the time who were just as affected by the attack at Pearl Harbor as any other American. And \\"Pearl Harbor\\" doesn't even acknowledge the fact that there was a large Asian community in Hawaii. the film portrays the Japanese-Americans as participants in the attack on Pearl Harbor).
0061040967|5.0|Terry Pratchett has been writing books about Discworld since at least the mid-1980's.  From that time on I have loyally followed it's eccentric denizens as they scooted about on the only turtle-powered world in the universe.  Pratchett normally leaves us wondering exactly what it all looked like. Not that he doesn't write good descriptive prose, mind you.  But all those places and characters are enough to severely stretch the imaginations of forgetful folks like me.  While there seem to have been some recently illustrated work, most of it has refused to appear in my local bookstores.  Well, thanks to illustrator Paul Kidby and &quot;The Last Hero,&quot; all that's been fixed.<br />The work in question is a Discworld novella, totaling 160 pages of large print with a lot of illustrations.  Even in this short space, Pratchett manages to put together his usual twisted, acerbically written plot.  Genghiz Cohen the (nonagenarian) Barbarian and his equally Silver Horde have set out for their last quest - to return fire to the gods.  After countless efforts at dying heroically they have decided to force the issue, and intend to use the Discworld equivalent of a hydrogen bomb to do it.  They are aided in this hero-brained scheme by Evil Harry Dread the Dark Lord, the now gray-haired Vena the Raven-Haired (AKA Mrs. McGarry), and bring along a desperately unwilling minstrel to take notes.<br />Earnestly trying to prevent Cohen's immolation of Cori Celesti, the Mountain of the Gods, is an equally motley crew.  The wizards of the Unseen College have appealed to Lord Vetinari, the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, for support in preventing an act which will destroy all magic and shut down Discworld permanently.  Vetinari enlists Leonard of Quirm (best known for dangerous inventions and pictures whose eyes follow you around) to figure out how to get to Cori Celesti in time to stop the Heroes.  Leonard invents the first spacecraft, powered by swamp dragons, and crewed by Leonard, Captain Carrot of the Watchmen, and Ridcully the Inept, one of Pratchett's oldest characters.  Oh, stowaway duties are done by the Librarian, an orangutan wizard.<br />Pratchett is at his tongue in cheek best.  I counted about 10 dire quips on each page, so expect to do a lot of smirking and giggling.  Pratchett has no qualms about parodying himself, and he does so with relish.  The plot, which is great fun, often gives away to the sheer exuberance of being able to say sarcastic and witty things at will.  And fans will spend hours picking out various Pratchett characters and figuring out in which book they first appeared.  Of course, DEATH makes his obligatory appearance.<br />And did I mention the illustrations?  Paul Kidby is the perfect illustrator for Pratchett.  He has a good sense of both the dramatic and the humorous and a detailed colorful style that harkens back to the illustrations on the old witch books.  I never once felt that he had gotten a figure wrong.  This is absolutely the perfect present for a Pratchett fan.  It has a bit of a sticker shock to it.  But for us addicts, it's worth it.  The rest of you should run off to a bookstore where you can snort and smirk for free, and peek at it first.  Then come back and buy it here at a discount.Carrot of the Watchmen, and Ridcully the Inept, one of Pratchett's oldest characters.

6304097050|5.0|Sugar Ray Robinson is considered by many to be the greatest boxer/fighter of all time, and I couldn't agree more. I don't tend to follow the trends or fads, or just agree with people for the sake of fitting in, but I'll tell you, he was truly the best that's ever done it.  This video is interesting.  It contains clips from a lot of Sugar Ray Robinson's fights, and even includes some footage of a few of his matches before turning pro. That's some good, old footage.  You simply can't go wrong with this video.  A lot of the video features Sugar Ray Robinson discussing his career, but it's him &quot;now,&quot; many years after his last ever boxing match.  This film was probably made sometime in the 1970's, I would assume, so that's the &quot;now&quot; I'm refering to.  It's nice to see that Ray Robinson looks good after all of those fights.  To me, he looks and sounds good, and even seems a bit nostalgic as he journeys back to the days of his boxing glory.<br />This video is one way for you to have an important film, containg important footage, of The Greatest Boxer/Fighter Of All Time.  Sugar Ray Robinson seems timeless, in a sport that's been around long before him, and has continued long after he left it. He's still the greatest!
B00005OWEG|3.0|The extra footage takes this film to a monster 3 hours 20 minutes. Unfortunately while some footage added detail and clarification, a lot of the added material is superfluous garbage. There was a good reason that Coppola cut scenes like the French Plantation in the original film. Unfortunately this new cut has turned one of the greatest films ever made into a dull test of endurance.    Worth watching only if you're an obsessive Apocalypse fan, or a film student (you could probably learn a lot about how bad editing can destroy the whole film from a comparison with the original cut).
B00005RFAI|1.0|Just as Pink's hair has changed from fuschia to blond, her music has changed from funky to bland.  Gone are the funky R &amp; B street sounds from her first album, leaving only a mediocre effort to move into the genre of &quot;girl rock&quot;.  Why would an artist who showed such promise with her debut change everything for the sophomore effort?  I don't &quot;undaztand&quot;!  My suggestion is to wait and see what the next cd brings.  If you absolutely have to buy this one, look for it used.  I'm sure there will be plenty of copies!
0446672653|5.0|I read Dr. Weiss' first book Many Lives, Many Masters and knew I had to read more from him.  I was immediately overwhelmed with a feeling of inner peace and spirituality that has remained a part of my life.  I could feel his tranquility and comfort in the subject matter. Then I found this book &quot;Only Love is Real&quot; and again was so amazed at the feeling of true love and peace that was evoked in the work.  The book has so impacted my life that its' title has become my own personal motto.  Reading this book caused me to step back and reassess my own life, its' direction, and the people I chose to include in my journey.  I only want others in my life that hold the same spiritual principals that have become most important to me.  Love and peace and a desire for knowing that life is a journey in attaining that goal of total love and total acceptance.  Thank you, Dr. Weiss, for exposing me to the beauty of love and the spiritual quest of realizing that indeed &quot;only love is real&quot;.

So as soon as I knew John Williams was doing Harry Potter (and heard the new score sample in the preview) I ran out and bought it for him. We weren't disapointed.<br />I highly recomend this CD for kids, adults, cats, dogs, anyone with ears. WHAT A FIND! I have to say he's a tie with Danny Elfman.
0385505833|4.0|I thought the book was funny and a very nice read. It's only 177 pages and I was able to read it over the weekend. It's one of those books you start and can't stop. Very enjoyable.
0380788624|5.0|I loved this book pretty much from beginning to end.  It does require lots of real-life RAM to keep track of all of the characters and subplots, but it's worth it - by the end of the book, a terrific haze of intermeshed narrative has descended.  Also, this book struck me as NECESSARILY long, like Infinite Jest or Gravity's Rainbow, rather than just overlong.  Wonderful, virtuosic writing, and full of vivid details, plus the great climactic creative scenes (the revelation from organ pipes, the sex-starved jail-cell code-cracking), make this one worth reading and re-reading.
0385505833|5.0|As I am reading , laughing out loud, with tears streaming down my face, and then experiencing uncontrollable outbursts of giggling between reading the chapters as I thought about the story, my husband was asking &quot;is it really THAT funny&quot;? My answer is yes. I thought so.I found it to be the healthiest thing I could do for myself during this hectic time of the year. I found the ending quite touching and sweet. To those who ruined the surprise by divulging what they called a  &quot;predictable ending&quot; shame on you. It was delightful.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 by Joseph Heller is a very strange novel.  It definitely has its high and low points like every novel.  This book however seemed a little more confusing than some other books that I have read in the past.  There were definitely many twists and turns throughout the story.<BR> Catch-22 is about a fighter pilot named Yossarian.  Yossarian is a man that finds himself in the middle of World War II.  He is very confused about what is going on but he is the only man that seems to know that his life is in jeopardy.  During the novel he takes you on many different adventures.  Some of them are quite funny while others are totally confusing.  He does not like the position he is in and he wants to get out of the war before he is killed.  Throughout the novel he runs into many different and interesting people.  While all of this is going on he is still trying to save his own life by trying to get out of the war.  This is where he runs into all of these different catches which forbid him from exiting duty.<BR> Overall I thought that this was a very good novel.  Throughout the book I ran into several confusing and misleading parts but it all seemed to make a connection later on in the book.  I think that the author did a very good job writing the novel.  It kept me very entertained.  I would highly recommend this book, although the reading level is a little more advanced I think that it is suitable for any high school student looking for a bit of a challenge.
B00005RIKD|2.0|You know, I really wanted to like this album. Sting's last live effort, Bring on the Night, was outstanding. He had a crack band made up of some of the best contemporary jazz musicians around, and everyone involved turned in an inspired performance. On his latest effort, he's still got a great band, but this time it's as if they're daring you to fall asleep. One of the coolest things about a Sting concert is the way he reworks his material. He does that here as well on several tracks, but in every case, the original versions are better. Too often, he seems like he's just going through the motions. Even newer songs like &quot;Brand New Day&quot; (one of the best things he's written recently) are played at a faster tempo, as if he's just trying to get them over with. The songs themselves are the biggest problem, though. Sting has seemed determined to put us to sleep with his last few albums, and unfortunately, he continues the trend here. Recommended only you're having trouble sleeping.
B0000507QH|4.0|What a strange movie! Prix Delluc 1998, a perfectly honorable artsy French prize, but it certainly spares you no graphic sex scene, nor the buttocks of Charles Berling (a favorite actor of mine)nor the bosoms of coy Sophie Guillemin. Sometime, you think you hit upon some deeply philosophical statement, and in the next scene you are wondering if you are watching a parody of the genre. Hilarious dialogue at times (without meaning to be, I am sure..), and hilarious situations, though I am sure it is not the moviemaker's intention to create mirth. All in all, great photography, beautiful colors, realistic bits of Paris's life, and fabulous acting. But would I recommend it to a friend without a certain sense of humor? Well....
0525946284|5.0|Ken Follett has reached back and pulled out his magic again. In trhe vwein of the Day of the Jackal, this book is excellent. I bought it the day it came out and could not put it down. Many hours later, I knew I read a classic. Follett in his realism, character development and action again proves he is the very best. I would recommend this book along with The Last Man Standing to the two very best books of 2001. Even though Code to Zero was excellent, this is much better. Set in WWII France, Follet presents no stop development with classical heroes and foes. Buy this book and you remember all the great things about Follett.
0553212443|5.0|This is a great book for everyone! I just got done reading it for school! It really shows the different families in that time period of London! I dont want to give to much away! A MUST READ! Plus its a very short book! You could read it in an hour!
B00005QZWI|4.0|This is clearly a soundtrack for which the sponsors did not want to take any risk. The music of Howard Shore is quite appropriate for the movie &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;; but I doubt if it will become legendary or cherished for long.<br />In general, there are two types of soundtracks: those that must be heard in conjunction with the moving images, and those that can also stand on their own (as audio CD). This soundtrack is clearly of the first type, and since I haven't been able to see the movie yet, it's difficult to stay mesmerized when listening to the CD. There's lots of overblown bombastic brass, which is at times quite tiring. The greatest thing about this score is, in my opinion, the contribution of the choir, which is absolutely necessary and fits in very well. Also, the dreamy tunes of Enya are also a welcome change to all the violent passages.<br />The main characteristic that makes Tolkien's work so beautiful is its deep sense of sorrow and loss, despite great heorism. Well, there's sure enough heroism in the soundtrack, but the sorrow and loss I find somewhat lacking in the music. Some passages sound so Vangelis-like that I wonder why they haven't asked him - after all, Vangelis has shown to be a master of creating sorrow in music with his monumental El Greco release in 1998. Still, I suppose we have little reason to complain - Howard Shore has done a &quot;decent&quot; job and I'm sure his themes and atmospheres fit complex storyline well. But it won't be in my top ten of all-time greatest soundtracks.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I had never heard of Howard Shore. But now, after hearing this, I don't think I'll soon forget the name. <br />This is a mighty fine soundtrack. As a pretty big classical music fan, it was easy for me to enjoy the musicality part, but as someone who's read the Lord of the Rings, it was also easy for me to appreciate what a spectacular job Mr. Shore did of corrolating the music with the story. As I listen, I can hear the story unfolding in the music. It is almost as if Tolkien himself was coaching Shore as he wrote. <br />I'm not a huge fan of the two Enya tracks by themselves, but I can see (or rather &quot;hear&quot;) how they will fit in the film. I was perfectly willing to overlook them to still give this CD an enthusaistic five stars.

6303187064|5.0|The Crow is an awesome awesome movie.  There's really nothing more you can ask for.  It's got everything, from a love story to sword-fighting to drug addiction.  It's very dark, but it only adds to the mood.  It's an excellent excellent movie, recommended to everyone except perhaps small children.  (&quot;Mommy...What are they doing to her? Why is she bleeding like that?&quot;)  Two thumbs up.

1563523302|5.0|Very interesting study of the millionaires in America.  I listened to the audio version of this book while travelling to and from work.  I found it to be very entertaining and well done. I've learned a great deal and would recommend this book to anyone who's wondering 'when am I going to be a millionaire?' or 'what does it take to become a millionaire?' in America.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|As the darkness slides away, melting to light, you begin hovering through the tree's in a flowing series of whiplashes. Tree's split apart and crash to the ground from some unknown force. Little do you know, as you enter an old cabin in the woods, that this will be your last night to live...if Ash has anything to say about it.<br />Made on a next to nothing budget, Evil Dead is still as disturbing today as when it was released. Do you know of any other horror's plastered with the NC-17 rating? Ultra-gore and erupting goo, with flying chainsaws and shotgun shells splatter throughout the cabin's interior. Imagine your sister, suddenly starting to predict the poker cards in your hand, one after the other, then jerking violently she levitates into the air spewing out incantation's and words of warning. Clock's stop, screams ring out...and what follows is one of the most graphically inclined series of horror segment's to ever be placed on film. As Blair Witch left everything to the imagination, Evil Dead leaves nothing to the imagination. After literally watching thousands of movies in my life this is by far the most disturbing. The last three times I have taken it to friends houses, they have made me take it out of the player within the first 20 minutes. How long can you last?<br />But, as gruesome as Evil Dead is, you will not likely find better representation of Good versus Evil. Ash, the hero, watches his friends around him turn into these hideous flesh craving creatures, and he must use everything good and strong that he can muster, to fight off the darkness. Turn out the light's, crank up the volume, and cheer for Ash.<br />(WARNING: When I say you have been warned, you have been warned, the sound and the images are extremely disturbing. It easily, with a little more, could have gone for the X rating. If robocop originally got an X rating, this would have tackled it.)<br />-It is still banned in several countries, including Finland.-<br />(Click my name to read the review's on the sequal's).view's on the sequal's).

0553712837|5.0|My wife and I both enjoyed this book a great deal.  It was very entertaining for us to listen to.  We listened to the CD audio edition of the book.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a comedy about Christmas.  The book actually turns out quite good, and almost made us cry in the end.  We are buying copies for our family to read before Christmas!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I've always felt that &quot;The Matrix&quot; was the ultimate DVD to show off the features of this relatively new home video format to friends who you were trying to lure into the world of DVD. Not anymore.<br />Let's start of with the first disc. Brilliant video and audio transfer of the film itself. Two separate, highly educational commentary tracks. A special English audio track, for the visually impaired, which gives full descriptions of  the on-screen occurrences other than the dialogue. A &quot;Follow the Green Fairy&quot; feature where you can click on the fairy which appears at the bottom left of your screen at various points in the film, to take a quick peek at some scene-specific production footage, intelligently explained by specific members of the crew.<br />The second disc is even more of a collector's dream. The deleted/alternate versions of scenes actually contain notes on which draft of the film they appeared in. The cast list doesn't contain the usual credits and brief biography that you usually see on DVDs - you get short featurettes with interviews of the stars where they talk about the experience of making the film, with on-topic clips interspersed throughout. In the &quot;Dance&quot; segment of the disc, you get extended versions of the production numbers in the film. Three of these actually allow you to shift the camera angle of the film, from four different continuous shots. To make selection easier, the alternate shots, running in sync, appear in smaller windows beneath the letterboxed main image you've selected.<br />When you click on the &quot;Music&quot; section, you'd expect videos for the two most popular songs from the film, but you actually get several bonuses - the live performance of Lady Marmalade from the MTV Movie Awards, a featurette, and even an interview with Fatboy Slim.<br />Even the &quot;Marketing&quot; segment contains more than the usual stills, posters and trailers. You actually get a montage of clips from the various TVprograms the film was featured on, from Network TV to E! and more.<br />All this, and I haven't even gone through the entire package. That will take days, possibly even weeks! The only thing that seems to be missing is the shooting script - or maybe I just haven't found it.<br />This is a MUST for any DVD Collection.
0380789019|5.0|I'm not usually a fantasy fan, but for this I would make an exception. The book is fantastic and grabs you right at the beginning. Having been to London recently and gone everywhere on the tube this book holds a special place. Neil Gaiman takes the everyday world and twists it into something fantastic. Definitely a must-read.
0671449028|5.0|My 15 month old daughter picks this book out every night for us to read, so now it has become a tradition for us to read it each night.  I could recite the whole text from memory but we like to look at the pictures together. The poem is very sing-songy - just right for setting the tone for bedtime.  I like the last page - &quot;rock and rock and rock to sleep&quot;.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This CD has the best music I have ever heard.  It is a great addition to my CD collection.
B00005NTNU|4.0|Finally! The original die-hard lethal weapon now has all of his adventures available on the digital format! I was wondering what took Warner Bros. so long. And the new digital transfer looks a whole lot better than the old VHS tapes I used to own! Looks like the WB did a bit of film clean-up as well- I don't see nearly as many scratches or other visual clutter in any of the movies like I did the VHS versions. If you're looking for the movies that made the police action genre what it is today, this is the series to take a gander at!<br />There must've been a time when being in a `Dirty Harry' flick was an actor's ticket to modest-to-amazing stardom. Andy Robinson, the Scorpio Killer from the original DH, eventually found his way into the hearts of the Trekkie minions as the Cardassian tailor/spy Garak on `Deep Space Nine'. Along with a brief appearance by Suzanne Somers, Robert Urich (`Vega$') and David Soul (`Starsky &amp; Hutch') were featured in `Magnum Force'. `The Enforcer' saw future `Cagney &amp; Lacey' co-star &amp; 4-time Emmy winner Tyne Daly as yet another unfortunate partner of Detective Callahan. And Liam Neeson &amp; Jim Carrey had their moments in `The Dead Pool'.<br />Like most, I consider the first `Dirty Harry' to be the best. There's just something about the way that it establishes the characters &amp; situations that Harry will have to face in the subsequent flicks. They could've made the fake blood more realistic-looking, however. Also included here: One half-hour documentary hosted by `Magnum Force' co-star Robert Urich, an original '71 behind-the-scenes doc, and theatrical trailer.<br />`Magnum Force' has its moments, and I found the idea of our anti-hero actually defending the system he dislikes against rogue elements in the police department an interesting one. This one also features one noticeable flub: The scene where Harry's dismantling his apartment mail box. After the wimpy complainer starts walking back upstairs saying he doesn't want to get involved, you can see for an instant the shadow of one of the crew members on the wall above the stairway. Then there's the less-than-convincing scene where a nude, coked-up blonde drops several stories to her death. If there's one scene in the entire DH canon that could use some of that `Star Wars Special Edition'-style digital correction, that particular moment is it! Also included is a brief doc on the evolution of cop flicks leading up to the first two `DH' mo-pics, and an original theatrical trailer.<br />I consider `The Enforcer' to be the weakest film of the bunch- the group of heavies looked kinda psycho, but didn't seem as scary or dangerous as previous or subsequent `DH' villains. The LAWS rocket climax was also pretty hokey. However, it has one of my fave moments in the entire series, where Harry asks Big Ed Mustapha, a Black Pantheresque militant, if he knows him from somewhere. This moment is something of an in-joke- Albert Popwell, the guy who portrayed Mustapha, also played the bank robber who felt lucky in `DH', the pimp in `Magnum Force', and Horace in the subsequent `Sudden Impact'. Strangely enough, he's absent from `The Dead Pool'. Also included: brief male full-frontal nudies (gasp!), a mini-doc, and a theatrical trailer.<br />I thought `Sudden Impact' was pretty cool, even though most of it takes place a short distance away from San Francisco, rather than in the city proper. It introduced us to Harry's `old stand-by', the .44 Automag, which made for an impressive addition to our anti-hero's silhouette during the climactic `final fight' scene. And let's not forget the introduction of his most famous line, \\"Go ahead... make my day.\\" Also added: common-law missus Sondra Locke, and Clint taking to the producer's &amp; director's seat for this one. `SI' also includes the most notable `blooper' in the series: while Harry's trying out the Automag at a makeshift target range in the woods, the aforementioned Horace drives up and opens the driver'sside door to get out. As the door opens, you can clearly see the camera man in the driver-side window's reflection! One of cinema's most glaring oopsies. No docs are included here, just the obligatory trailer.<br />Finally, there's the `Dead Pool', featuring the most bizarre car chase scene I've ever witnessed! And who could forget Harry's takin' out the last scumbag? Just when you thought he was dependent on the .44 Magnum revolver to protect himself, he surprises you with his improvisational skills! Also featured: another unfortunate cop partnered up with Callahan who's only one of two folks throughout the five flicks to survive the experience! As expected, a trailer is included.<br />All in all, the Dirty Harry  collection box set is a pretty good presentation of the entire series. There's not an exhaustive array of extras, but if you're a big-time fan, I'm sure you'll consider yourself fortunate to have some new stuff to look at. Too bad WB still hasn't caught wind of putting their DVDs in plastic keep cases, rather than those flimsy cardboard snap sleeves that they still seem to be partial to. C'mon, Warner, let's get with the times here!<br />`Late
B0000004V2|5.0|From the first song to the last, this album has everything. We need more music like this!
B000002GY9|5.0|I think that anyone who took the time to listen to this album would soon be hooked--no matter what their tastes.  It is brilliant.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I found &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; in a local video store, and really only got it because it was used, and cheap.  Took it home, didn't know what to expect. I found it was a treasure and a few days later, bought the DVD.<br />From the title sequence I knew something was up, they weren't ordinary, a kid bouncing up and down through the screen. Then moving into the first &quot;real&quot; scene I watched closer, the film drew me in, I couldn't stop watching. <br />Right off, the viewer finds great character development, with 11-year-old Billy at home caring after of his aged &quot;Grama&quot; and then more, with his dad and older brother heading off to the miner's picket line in their small Northern England town. His newly deceased mom appears there at home in family photos on the piano top.<br />Next scene, Billy is drawn into a girl's ballet class that just happens to meet where he's taking boxing lessons. That's where we meet the rest of the main characters, his school-mate Michael, his dance teacher, Mrs wilkinson and her daughter, Debbie. <br />The expected conflicts arise as Billy pursues his passion for dancing. Family, culture, economics, and just plain ol' growin' up come into the fray. Billy's resolve and guts drive him through to his goal of being a ballet dancer. The happy ending is expected, but getting there is what's unexpected.<br />This film has greatly directed scenes that are composed like a master painter. Scenes move artistically from one to the next. Watch for the blend from the Fred Astaire movie clip moving right on screen to the scene with Grama and him as they go to visit Billy's mom's grave. Later, watch for the slight turn of his father's head as he sits on Billy's bed moving to the next scene as dad decides to be a &quot;scab&quot;, going back to the mine for Billy's sake. I think &quot;little&quot; stuff like that makes for a great movie. <br />The story is well written. The acting is dramatic and believable.<BR>The music is worth getting the soundtrack. The dancing scenes are just great, from the initial stumbling about with Mrs. Wilkinson, to serious artistry when Billy auditions at the Royal Ballet School. Jamie Bell as Billy is a kid you cannot help but to root for in this movie and in the future as well. He's a talent that I pray no one exploits, I think you'll want to wish the best for him. <br />I missed it at the theatre but found &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;, a real treasure, buried at my local video store. And then later, with the added features on DVD.
B00005QCVY|5.0|One of the greatest single lines in any movie ever made, and a source of inspiration to me when times have been bad.  Even today, when George opens Clarence's book and reads that line, it still gets me!  A superb film that puts all of our lives in perspective, whether we are kings or paupers.  Ah, what I wouldn't give for the chance to see what the world would be like without me, and what kind of impact I've made on the people in my life . . .
B000002LK1|5.0|I usually foward to the next song here and there with most Pop/Alternative music CD's, but not this particular Depeche Mode CD.  All, and I do mean *all* songs on this CD are cool.  &quot;Enjoy the Silience&quot; is probably the most popular song but I tend to like the song, &quot;World in My Eyes&quot; just a little bit better.
0440539811|3.0|Okay, this book was great, I loved it. But I also agree with another review someone wrote that also thought all the 'sex detours' were a bit much and got very annoying and pointless. Despite that, the book is great. If you're very closeminded and take everything seriously then this might not be the book for you. Its not really that confusing of a read.
1558807381|1.0|(This review refers to the American version.) I regret to say that renting this for family movie night was my decision. After it was over, I had to get down on my knees and apologize for making those I hold dear sit through it. The acting was sub-par, the scenes were poorly spliced, and the plot was hackneyed at best. The score sounded like someone had heard the Neverending Story soundtrack one too many times and couldn't quite let go of it. The only remotely bright spot was Tim Curry as the villain, but even he was stereotypical and largely wasted.
B00004RYZT|5.0|This DVD of Rammstein's performance back in Berlin 1999 is amazing. Rammstein have the best live act in the world and it is a shame that i never got to witness this concert for myself. The DVD is great, but it is only second best to actually seeing their live performances. The main highlight for me was &quot;Du Hast&quot; (You Hate) which, lets face it, is probably the most popular Rammstein song! This DVD is amust for all Rammstein fans and music lovers also!!!!!!
B00005R2M3|2.0|I had the pleasure of seeing Shakira record her MTV Unplugged CD about two years ago. I then had the agony of watching her perform in English on SNL. She has been, Tony Matoled &amp; Emilio Estefaned right out of her charm and genuine appeal. They even tried to make her look like Mariah Carrie!! For me, Laundry List belongs in the bargin bin. Que lastima!<br />FF
B000002UAR|5.0|The world of rock and roll was once again shattered on November 29, 2001, when George Harrison passed away in Los Angeles after a four-year battle with cancer.  Probably the most tragic occurance of his death is the fact that he was well respected as a musician and songwriter, but he never really got as much respect as Paul McCartney and John Lennon did.  I know that's tough to say, but it's the truth.  Fortunately, Harrison's solo albums are starting to finally resurface on the charts, and I'm talking about his underrated solo efforts, not just ALL THINGS MUST PASS (1971) and CLOUD NINE (1987).<br />Usually, Beatles fans argue which Beatle album showcased Harrison's developing growth as a singer/songwriter.  Although many of them choose either RUBBER SOUL (the first Beatles record to feature two Harrison songs) or ABBEY ROAD (which feature Harrison's more popular ditties &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;), I've decided to choose the Fab Four's 1966 album REVOLVER.  While the aforementioned records only contain two Harrison songs each, REVOLVER has a whopping three, making it the clear winner and displaying George's ambition to step out of the shadow of Paul and John and go his own direction.<br />The first of the three songs is the opener &quot;Taxman,&quot; a cynical satire on the British tax system.  With its biting lyrics and rollicking guitar riff, the message of the tune still holds up 33 years later.  Next is the ultra-psychedelic &quot;Love You To,&quot; the first of Harrison's Indian ragas.  Though not quite as good as &quot;Within You Without You&quot; (from SGT. PEPPER), &quot;Love You To&quot; is still listenable with its graceful sitar playing and awesome tabla drums which give it an airy feel.  Last but not least we have &quot;I Want to Tell You.&quot;  The style of this song showcases Harrison's signature sound on subsequent releases and also shows that he can write an intelligent pop song like Paul or John.  And you gotta lovethat piano hook!  REVOLVER is not the Beatles' best work, but it's still essential for those three Harrison songs.  They're possibly the best trio of songs on the entire record, which is saying a lot.<br />May you rest in peace, George.  The whole world will miss you.
0780622553|5.0|If you look up the word &quot;underrated&quot; in the dictionary, you'll find a still from this sci-fi masterpiece that nobody seems to notice. Rufus Sewell stars as a man trying to solve a mystery -- that of his own life. He doesn't remember who he is or where he came from, but he knows that he may be a murderer... If director Alex Proyas ever wanted to do a Batman movie he's got my vote -- he's got the atmosphere DOWN. Kiefer Sutherland is good as a scientist who gets roped into events beyond his ability to fight, and Jennifer Connelly... dear Lord, what can I say about Jennifer Connelly? That she's perhaps the most beautiful creature God ever placed on this Earth? That she's got the sort of classic beauty that's just not appreciated anymore, but that if she'd been born a few decades ago she'd have been up there with Vivian Leigh or Audrey Hepburn? It's all true. But this is a SMART movie (perhaps what scared so many people away), one that requires you to think. It's worth watching.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|what a wicked, keep-you-on-your-toes dvd (you HAVE to see it on dvd, so you can go back and look at specific scenes, and the extra stuff is amazing) i was enthralled all throughout this movie, by the cinematography, the directing, and backwards storyline.  not to mention guy's body, ouch, literally made me swoon. . .in case you cant tell, i loved this movie, and everyone should definetely own this.
B00004YRQA|1.0|At close to ($price) Sony's official memory card is way overpriced.  It probably costs them $2 or $3 to make it but we end up paying dearly.  Unfortunately you should not buy third-party memory products; none of them offers complete compatibility with the PS2.  Sony's memory is slow, but at least reliable.
B00005OM4N|2.0|Fans looking for the innocent pop stylings of Britney Spears will be severely jolted by her self-titled album. The romantic, upbeat, peppy and fun songs that we loved on &quot;baby... one more time&quot; and &quot;oops! I did it again...&quot; are missing. In their place are violent, choppy modern -- what? it's not rock, it's not pop, it's not rap. It's kind of a techno combination of all three. Britney rasps her voice (she'd better quit or risk permanently damaging her vocal chords) and plays around halfheartedly with forgettable lyrics. What happened? <br />In addition, her works are getting progressively more raunchy. Mild profanity. Innuendo. Rebellion. And then there's the accompanyment. The CD itself is engraved with three obviously naked fairies. The back of the disk (and most of the insert) sports Britney in a barely-there ensemble at that at first glance makes you think she's topless. <br />This is one fan who's decided to pull the plug. And unfortunately, this album makes it much easier than I thought.
B00001QGPR|1.0|Diary of an unfulfilled pop star or sympathy card to his generation? Does it matter? Bowie's 23rd album spares us another round of trend-hopping, opting for a more believable adult-contemporary groove, but his pathological ironic detachment makes him hard to take seriously as Love's Survivor. Even so, this album didn't have to be so weak -- the emotional heft in Bowie's songs has never come from him but his guitarists, from Mick Ronson to Stevie Ray Vaughan. A pity that Reeves Gabrels is such a cipher. His latest collaboration with Bowie is typically stagnant; bloodless guitars and synths substitute half-baked \\"moods\\" for genuine emotions. As for lyrics, take your pick from obtuse, half-finished or banal. \\"Sometimes I cry my heart to sleep ... Sometimes my courage fell to my feet,\\" the auteur laments in \\"Thursday's Child.\\" That would be drippy even if it didn't come from a billionaire married to a supermodel.
6300267881|4.0|If any of you are looking to buy this movie, don't listen to Jonathan Taylor. First of all, he can't spell. Second, this movie is a cult classic. It paved the way for every modern day horror movie. I'll admit, the 'effects' are a little cheesy, but it was the 70's for pete's sake. Some of the scariest moments are those you only see for a split second. I watched this movie at a cast party, and we ended up pausing it on the face of 'the evil one.' The effects do not have to be computer-generated to be scary. There doesn't need to be all blood and gore. This religous freak-out more than makes up for any lack of effects. Buy, watch, scream.
B000002MP2|3.0|I was reading my old review, which remains intact below, and I discovered it was a bit harsh.  I really do like this album, but it isn't my favorite and I think you would be better off buying 1039/smooth, Kerplunk, or Insomniac as those are my favorites.<BR>I'm also changing my star rating from 1 to 3<BR><BR>First review:<BR><BR>This is the most overrated Green Day album. Personally I think it is horrible. It has very very few good pieces of music.<BR>The only tracks worth listening to are Long View and Welcome to Paradise. <BR>I can't pinpoint what is it about this album, but I just don't like it and I rarely listen to. If you want a good Green Day CD I suggest buying 1039/smooth or Kerplunk, but not Dookie.
B00005QXDD|4.0|this is a surprisingly well-produced, not half-bad sounding first studio effort from the Tenacious D boys... then of course, for those who saw Jack Black sing in 'High Fidelity', this doesn't come as a complete surprise.<br />About half the cuts consist of very funny-- but often quite explicit and raunchy-- dialogues between the two bandmates.  This one is not for the kids!<br />Even the topics of the songs are pretty funny.  'Wonderboy' sticks out in my mind as one of the more accessible cuts.  Here Jack Black shows off the pipes... this guy has enough musical talent to cut it as a serious musician... 'Wonderboy' may even develop into a single with radio play.  Who knows?<br />And the cut on Ronnie James Dio being washed up was also quite amusing.  But overall, it's light-fare, and not a disc that I would keep in constant rotation in player.  Tenacious D still have in my opinion a ways to go to become a serious musical band versus the cult club-act and amusing comedians that they have been so far.
B00005JKES|5.0|I remember I was working 2nd shift when Twin Peaks aired so I only caught a couple of episodes. It looked interesting, but I knew I was missing too much information to enjoy what I saw. Several years later a friend told me all the episodes were for rent at a local video store. I rented them three or four times before I broke down and bought the set. A couple of years later I loaned them to another fan who promptly dissapeared forever. The lesson to you is do not borrow a set or you'll dissapear too. Buy your own. Now I get to buy a much better set. How could it be worse? I'd buy the DVDs just for the bonus stuff alone! I'm pretty sure the first season is going to sell out fast. There's so many of us who love Twin Peaks.
0345409671|3.0|The Fifth book in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, Memnoch the Devil gives an interesting view of christianity and of God and the Devil. This book, in my opinion, is my least favorite of all the Vampire Chronicles. Memnoch didn't have the action-packed, page turning, fast paced plot that I have come to know and love in Anne Rice's novels. This story tells of The Vampire Lestat's decent through heaven and hell guided by Memnoch the Devil. I thought that this book involved to many theories and spent too much time on thought and flashbacks to the beginnings of time. Most of the characters from the previous novels were not even in it, and it was long and hard to follow.
B00003CXTG|1.0|A Movie...that shall live...in Infamy....  This movie's problems are legion. First off the plot line was apparently written by a hyperactive fourteen-year-old who was laid up for a weekend with a bad cold.  Best buddies dream of flying, grow up, join the Air Corps.  Buddy One (Affleck), in a (literally) dyslexic fit of passion meets Girl (Beckinsale).  Buddy One then proceeds to leave Girl to fight Germans with the RAF, as he would apparently rather fight than....well pardon my almost French.  Buddy Two (Hartnett) stays behind because Buddy One did not tell him it was voluntary service and he assumed he couldn't go (apparently he had to stay home and wipe wings with Jimmie Doolittle).  (...) Casting problems:  This film was primarily a posing piece for  Affleck and Hartnett, who just look too \\"generation duh\\" to pull off a forties fighter jock.  In a real war, both would have been shot and left in a ditch by their own men.  And Jimmie Doolittle was (...) not a pudgy, aging, lantern-jawed ex-sex-symbol (Baldwin).<br />The script overall was riddled with hackneyed plot-twists, up to and including a plucky little doggie with a hurt paw.<br />The raid on Japan was a direct rip-off of the 1940s classic \\"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.\\"<br />In essence, this was the movie \\"1941\\" without the laughs, as it is about as historically accurate (...).<br />This is just a bad movie, and that's all there is to it.  With so many magnificent TRUE stories of heroism, courage, and devotion to duty generated on that Day of Infamy, I cannot understand why the writer felt the need to fabricate the story line he did, and I wonder if he actually read any actual accounts of the event before he set pen to paper.
B00003CXXR|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. Very exciting stuff. I really like jumping out of my seat. The only real problem I have with the Jurassic Park Trilogy is that it really strayed away from the book. When you read &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;The Lost World&quot; you are more scared than ever. There was so much more in the books I can't imagine why they skimped in the films. I found it odd that elements in the first book were put into the second movie and the third movie. I loved the ending in &quot;JP&quot; the book. I'd wished they did that in the film. I always kind of wondered where those <BR>raptors were heading off to. Also, there were 2 children in the &quot;Lost World&quot; book and they went through hell with those raptors. The whole flying dinosaurs scene is actually in the first book. So you are literally being bounced around between book 1 and 2. Other than that these films are fun to watch.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|If you loved the theatrical release of &quot;Almost Famous&quot; then this is just what the doctor ordered. I'd read the script in it's original form before I saw &quot;Untitled&quot; and I knew that this version of the film would really complete the story. I WAS RIGHT! Throw in all of the extra features (including a 6 song CD of music from Stillwater) and you have a DVD that's a gem! If there was a disappointing moment it was when I realized that the intervention scene was still deleted from this version of the film. No worries though...Cameron Crowe couldn't get the rights to use &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; in the scene. The scene is included in the DVD set...you just add the song from your own personal collection. They tell you when to start playing it and the scene is complete. This is a must have for any &quot;Almost Famous&quot; fan!!
B00005O5CM|2.0|I enjoy a great fluff movie as much as the next person, but this was just too over the top. This movie was just too cliche, had too many product placements (hello, Clinique) and was just full of too many holes. I know movies are full of holes, but these were just too big for me to overlook.<br />One of the holes I had the biggest problem with was that she took the LSATs at the last minute and breezed through it, and then turned around and applied to law school.  This all seemed to happen within a few weeks, and this is actually something that takes over six months to do.  Since this was actually vital to the plot, I just had a hard time looking past it.<br />If you want to see a good Reese Witherspoon movie, check out Election.
B00003CXGG|2.0|The movie is entertaining enough. Soundtrack is okay if you like that kind of music. The martial arts is very good, as can be expected of yet li. The story is ....... well, you all know Romeo and Juliet. Nothing else special to mention. <BR>You can spend 2 hour being entertained but don't expect a good plot. Just wait for the next fighting scene and you'll cope.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I thought good movies were only true in fairy tales, meant for some-other dimension and not for mine.  Fart, burp, insect and ear wax jokes...what more can a person want.  My four year old loved and laughed with this movie as much I did.  The humour was great, animation amazing and voice acting seriously impressive.  I usually don't enjoy &quot;regular&quot; actors doing voice work, but they did good choices in this case, though perhaps Cameron Diaz could have been a little stronger.  I have never seen so many fairy tale references/parodies before, and I loved it.
B00004XOWM|5.0|I am a down right Limp Bizkit fan and I thought this was definitely their best album(so far).  This album was edgy. My favorite tracks were #3-My Generation #6-Rollin'  I really liked #10-Take a look around from M.I. 2 that was a real good song...I liked #9-Getcha Groove on a whole lot too..Limp Bizkit is one of my favorite bands and yes Fred Durst does use obseen, offensive language but the cd is Parental Advisory and thats known and I don't think Limp uses as harsh vulgar words as some others out there.  I loved this album cause it had a lot of their great hits on it(Rollin', My Way, My Generation..etc..)  It had the most variety and above all its their best album..if you have both of Limp's otha albums buy this one...its worth buying and its their best.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Really great album, meaningful tunes and once again the lyrics are straight from the heart.Hands down 2 p!nk, she did a great job. Alot more pop than her first album though.
B00005M989|5.0|As a Prince fanatic, I understand those who lambaste this quick-buck compilation. No single CD could ever do justice to his genius. Even the 3-CD set of singles and B-sides omits much crucial music.<br />But let's be practical. There are millions of people who will never listen to &quot;Lovesexy&quot;, who don't even care about &quot;Erotic City&quot;. (Their loss.) They simply want Prince's catchiest songs all gathered in one place, they're entitled to have it, and this does a perfectly adequate job.
6304366086|3.0|During the early-to-mid-1960s, John Frankenheimer made a string of unforgettable four-star classics: &quot;Birdman Of Alcatraz,&quot; &quot;The Manchurian Candidate,&quot; and &quot;Seven Days In May.&quot;  Afterwards, Frankenheimer gradually deteriorated as a director and the racing car epic &quot;Grand Prix&quot; sadly seems to be the film that signaled the end of this once great filmmaker.<br />The nearly three-hour-long &quot;Grand Prix&quot; is a well-meaning but instantly forgettable racing car drama.  The film chronicles the lives and loves of four international auto racers: American James Garner, Frenchman Yves Montand, Englishman Brian Bedford, and Italian Antonio Sabato.  Technically, the film is brilliant; the camerawork and and film editing are excellent.  Unfortunately, the superior technical work cannot save the film.  &quot;Grand Prix&quot; is a decent yet bloated and unmemorable racing car epic.  John Frankenheimer couldn't seem to decide whether to create a straight dramatic film or a documentary about international auto racing.  &quot;Grand Prix&quot; goes into significant depth about the sport of race car driving; the film potentially succeeds more as a documentary than as a straight drama.  The film is overlong by about an hour.  Frankenheimer basically wastes a great cast.  James Garner, Brian Bedford, and Antonio Sabato do their best with a somewhat lackluster script.  The late great Toshiro Mifune is given a completely thankless role as a Japanese automaker; Mifune would go on to work with Frankenheimer one more time in the mediocre action film &quot;The Challenge.&quot;  Eva Marie Saint, who plays a journalist, and the charismatic Yves Montand are the only players who manage to succeed in adding some sorely needed magic for the film.  Although she earned an Oscar for &quot;On The Waterfront,&quot; Saint never quite became a superstar and was definitely worthy of such a rank.  Saint was truly a thinking man's sex symbol.<br />&quot;Grand Prix&quot; is only for big autoracing fans.
B000002UB3|5.0|My emotions have certainly been all over the place for the past few days, and &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; certainly takes on a new poignance with the tragic passing of George Harrison on November 29, but Abbey Road has always had a wistful, playful feel and that fact is underscored by the fact that The Beatles were on their last legs as a band when this was recorded.<br />From start to finish, this LP is perfect, George's guitar playing had grown so expressive and fluid that he dominates the entire first side, Paul McCartney's songwriting anchors the album but his bass playing is a downright miracle (witness his jazzy, funky lines on &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot;.<br />Ringo actually solos on the album closing &quot;The End&quot; and does a damn fine job! His open high-hat, snare and footwork on this track is outstanding. John,as always lays his soul bare on the aforementioned &quot;I Want You..&quot; and proves that his cryptic lyrical side is fully intact on &quot;Come Together&quot;, classic. Listening to &quot;Abbey Road&quot; it's hard to believe that these are the same cheeky young lads who wailed joufully out of tune on &quot;Please Please Me&quot; 7 years earlier, but they are and that perfectly demonstrates the greatest trait the Fab Four possessed that still sets them apart from their comtemporaries, Growth. This is what true artistry is all about. REST IN PEACE GEORGE, WE'LL MISS YOU.
6304244304|1.0|I thought that the laughable eco-monster movie &quot;Prophecy&quot; was John Frankenheimer's only horror-science fiction movie until I came across &quot;The Island Of Dr. Moreau&quot; a few weeks ago.  Sadly, &quot;The Island Of Dr. Moreau&quot; is even worse than &quot;Prophecy&quot; and qualifies as one of John Frankenheimer's very worst films.<br />British ambassador David Thewlis is planewrecked at sea and rescued by &quot;veterinarian&quot; Val Kilmer.  Kilmer takes Thewlis to the island of Dr. Moreau(Marlon Brando), a mad scientist who is attempting to create a superior species by inserting the DNA of humans into animals.<br />John Frankenheimer's adaptation of H.G. Wells' &quot;The Island Of Dr. Moreau&quot; is the director's second worst film after &quot;99 and 44/100% Dead.&quot;  The makeup work is excellent but this one element cannot save the film.  John Frankenheimer and screenwriters Richard Stanley and Ron Hutchinson apparently wanted &quot;TIODM&quot; to be a thinking man's horror movie.  In a manner somewhat similar to &quot;Prophecy,&quot; Frankenheimer and the screenwriters take Wells' horror-science fiction tale and attempt to create a social fable by interweaving socio-political concepts into the story.  In &quot;TIODM,&quot; Stanley and Hutchinson interweave themes such as class division and revolution into the tale.  Unfortunately, &quot;TIODM&quot; simply becomes another disastrously ridiculous and forgettable horror movie.  The screenplay is howlingly poor.  With the possible exception of Arthur Penn's &quot;The Missouri Breaks,&quot; Marlon Brando has never looked more embarrassing in a movie.  With dark classes, white makeup, robe, and cap, Brando makes an absolutely absurd entrance into the film.  Val Kilmer also manages to look equally foolish.<br />&quot;TIODM&quot; is only for diehard Marlon Brando fans and science-fiction enthusiasts.
B00001XT76|5.0|This movie is a MUST for everyone who loves dancing and sixties music.  Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey are fantastic.  Patrick is a professional dancer and Jennifer is a fast learner.  The support actors are great too.  The story takes place in 1963 at a Jewish resort.  Baby (Grey) and her sister Lisa are the daughters of a very prominant doctor whose patient is the owner of the resort that they go to.  The family gets one of the best suites that the owner has to offer.  Baby is a rebel, yet she is loving and has a purpose.  She is not afraid to be who she is meant to be.  I am going to save the end for you, but here are my words: GO AND SEE THIS VIDEO.  IT IS A MUST!!!!!!!
B000031WD9|5.0|AMERICAN PIE is a comedy about four high school friends (Jim, Kevin, Finch, and Oz) who make a pact to lose their virginity before the night of the high school prom. There's plenty of humor, nudity, and crude gags to make you fall out of your seat laughing.

B00005R62K|3.0|Of all the albums that JP did in the 70's, this is definitely their weakest, though I still recommend it. It does sport a great album cover, tho! Stained Class was a transitional album for JP, where they started to abandon their SABBATH influenced prog metal and go for a simpler,more straight forward hard rock sound. There is plenty to like<br />here, especially the Deep Purple-like hard rocker SAVAGE and the title track and INVADER, this last song being only one of three JP songs on which bassist IAN HILL got a co-writing credit.<br /><br /> My favorite track is the one that sparked the most controversy, JP's cover of the SPOOKY TOOTH song BETTER BY YOU, BETTER THAN ME. JP had a real knack for doing a great job with covers during the 70's(e.g. DIAMONDS AND RUST and THE GREEN MANALISHI) and this is no exception. Elsewhere, some of the songs just seem like<br />riffs with vocals added. The low point of the album is SAINTS IN<br />HELL, JP's most unintentionally silly song and unfortunately a<br />sign of things to come for them with some of their cartoon metal<br />songs of the 80's.<br />  I highly recommend the recently remastered version on cd.<br />The addition of song lyrics is a brilliant one; one really needs<br />them for early JP songs! Also, the bonus track FIRE BURNS BELOW<br />is quite enjoyable, even tho' the song was recorded in 87. The<br />highlight of this track is without a doubt the guitar playing.<br />The classical guitar solo is an unexpected, but very nice touch!<br />Incidentally, just in case you haven't figured it out yet, if<br />you put the spines of all the remastered cds together, you'll<br />get a picture! I don't know what it is yet, for I haven't got<br />all the remastered cds, but trust me they really do form a<br />picture!
015670160X|5.0|&quot;Orlando&quot; is such a playful novel, full of richness of characters and commentaries. Written as a love letters of sorts to Woolf's lover Vita Sackville-West, &quot;Orlando: A Biography&quot; follows Orlando from the years of Queen Elizabeth I's reign to late 1928, from the time he was a man to the time she became a woman. With this book, Woolf tried to give a fantasy life to her lover, where she could be a man and be her own person, instead of subject to society's ways. And by itself, it's such a gorgeous story! Especially with the fascinating asides where Orlando is addressing the reader.

B00005214X|5.0|Collectively, McCartney's efforts in his greatest hits album exceeds Harrison in numbers and hit songs.  Harrison's album is the best individual Beatle album however. Even though some of these songs were said to be leftovers  from previous Beatle sessions, there is not a bad song on the album.  Compared to Lennon's albums which sometimes sounded like he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  This album is serene, whimsical and the most musical of all.  Highlights are of course: My Sweet Lord, What Is Life and my favorites like Apple Scruffs, I Dig Love, The Ballad of Frankie Crisp and Beware of Darkness.  The Phil Spector production is vast and grand.  Sidement include Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Ringo and many other luminaries from that early 70's period.  The box is cool with George's humor coming through showing the increasing amount of pollution and urban sprawn over the last 30 years on the CD jackets inside.  This is an album that has stood the test of time.  After Paul's  light pop tunes and John's angry venom, George proves that there is no substitute for  really good music.  The second best solo Beatle album?...McCartney, his first solo album.
B00001QEE7|5.0|&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; has to be the best Disney film EVER! Ariel is the greatest heroine...and while Mulan (whom some think is better than Ariel ) is a strong, real girl...she just didn't have the same magic that Ariel and Jasmine had. Another thing...I really didn't like &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;! It was so dark...the broadway version (With Susan Egan as Belle--SO MUCH better than Paige O'Hara) was better. I dunno. The Little Mermaid is TEN TIMES better than BATB. Plus, &quot;Part of your World&quot; is the most beautiful song in the whole world. The whole score is just magical. &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, and &quot;Hercules&quot; are the true hits of Disney. Definately buy TLM!
B00005N9CV|4.0|While this effort has been called weak or thin by some, it still beats most of what is offered as good music these days. The songs on this album don't immediately grab the listner as some of her earlier albums, but the quality is still there. If you have a 100 CD changer like I do, and you are looking for a solid recording (ie, more than one or two &quot;hits&quot; followed by drivel) to add to the mix, this will fit the bill.

B000002LHX|5.0|Report to Commissioner Gordon on the Batman Soundtrack.<br />There's something well, quirky about this CD.  Don't get me wrong, this ranks among one of Prince's best efforts.  It's just that it sounds like he cranked this one out in three/four weeks compared to the material he spends more time on.  Then again, the man eats, drinks, sleeps, dreams, and bleeds music.<br />In each song, he lists the lead vocal as one of the main characters from the movie:  Batman, the Joker, Vicki Vale, and Bruce Wayne.  There's also a character called Gemini, half of him representing good, the other half representing evil, who makes his only appearance in the ultra-kickin' track &quot;Batdance&quot;, but it's a significant appearance.<br />Holy Frozen Smile!  The best lead vocalist here is the Joker.  &quot;Electric Chair&quot;, &quot;Partyman&quot;, and &quot;Trust&quot;.  The thumping bass and rough guitar on &quot;Electric Chair&quot; is comparable to the Joker's dark side.  The latter two are just fun, reflecting the villain's playful side.  I mean face it, who was the more interesting character in the movie?  When the villain steals the show from the hero, there's gotta be something wrong, right?  Or is it just Jack Nicholson's superiority as an actor compared to Michael Keaton?  As a result, the Joker's songs are more playful, being the twisted libertine he is, while Batman's songs are more somber, brooding, and romantic (check out &quot;Scandalous&quot;).<br />&quot;The Arms Of Orion&quot; is his second vocal collaboration with Sheena Easton and both parties got the best with this wonderful ballad.<br />&quot;Lemon Crush&quot; has a little bit of the funk reminiscent of The Time.  &quot;Scandalous&quot; is another lovely ballad done in his falsetto voice.  It has the dishonor of being played over the closing credits of the movie, at which time the stop button is pressed on the VCR or DVD.<br />The raucous guitar and techno beat of &quot;Batdance&quot; is a summary of the movie, both in movie soundbites and to some extent of some of the earlier songs, such as &quot;The Future&quot; and &quot;Electric Chair&quot;.  The song explodes with chaos and violence at the end until Prince himself says &quot;Stop&quot;, ending the song abruptly.  Genius of the man!<br />End of Report.  Please call me at the Bat Cave if there are any questions.both in movie soundbites and to some extent of some of the earlier songs, such as &quot;The Future&quot; and &quot;Electric Chair&quot;.

B00005Q66T|5.0|Today's topic: artists who release a second or third greatest hits compilation. The given for that would naturally be someone with longevity, legendary status, and an entire body of work that has transcended the generations, e.g. Elton John, The Rolling Stones. Oh yes, it also serves as a unifying synthesis of a particular phase in the artist's career, which means the artist might be planning another phase of his/her career.<br />Madonna's GHV2 embodies the Maverick quartet--Erotica, Bedtime Stories, Ray Of Light, and Music, that showed her vocal powers slowly reaching heights of quality that peaked during her performance in Evita and ripened with richness and perfection in the William Orbit-produced Ray Of Light.<br />Two songs that would have better representatives from Erotica were left off--\\"Rain\\" and \\"Bad Girl\\". Pity, I liked them better than \\"Erotica\\" or \\"Deeper And Deeper\\". But that's OK. She's had more than enough hits so somewhere along the line, she has to do some trimming. Also, Erotica was a transitional album, so that's to be expected.<br />Also noticeably absent was her rendition of \\"American Pie\\"--guess the pie dough got too rancid, and \\"You Must Love Me\\" from Evita. However, the Evita standard \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\", whose performance made Madonna one of the elite number of singers who deserved to sing that classic Lloyd Webber number, and \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", the single from Austin Powers with its Doors-influenced opening and \\"da da da da da da etc.\\" chorus, made it on GHV2.<br />What really makes this compilation worth it is the inclusion of the Ray Of Light singles: \\"Frozen\\", \\"Ray Of Light\\", \\"The Power Of Goodbye\\", and \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\". And the best Madonna ballad to date, \\"Take A Bow\\", is included.<br />That's it. If there aren't any questions, there will be a pop quiz on Madonna next week. Class dismissed!

B000000WCA|5.0|Yes, this is pure guilty-pleasure pop.. but so what? It's fun to listen to! <BR>Now that that's out the way, let me just say that this is a good, but nto great, pop CD. Before hearing their sophomore release, &quot;Spice World,&quot; I would have rated this CD better, but &quot;Spice World&quot; makes this CD look bad, save for a few tracks.<br />1. &quot;Wannabe&quot; - Who HASN'T heard this song!?! I really don't need to review it, since you've all heard it.<br />2. &quot;Say You'll Be There&quot; - You've probably heard this one, too, but, if not, let me just say that it's better than &quot;Wannabe.&quot; The music is much catchier.<br />3. &quot;2 Become 1&quot; - A really pretty ballad. Even though this is pop, this song is very pretty, and much more &quot;mature&quot; than the first two singles.<br />4. &quot;Love Thing&quot; - And now we return to the famous Spice Girls' pop sound. This song is like &quot;Wannabe,&quot; only less dynamic.<br />5. &quot;Last Time Lover&quot; - This song adds some sutry R&amp;B to the mix. Extremely catchy, with a great beat.<br />6. &quot;Mama&quot; - A ballad dedicated to mom's everywhere. It's a really pretty song, although it can be sickeningly sweet. But play it for your mom, tell her that's how you feel about her, and she'll cry.<br />7. &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; - Eh. That's really all there is to say about this song. It doesn't have the funky pop beats or the lush balladry of the aforementioned tracks. Skip it.<br />8. &quot;Something Kinda Funny&quot; - See Track 7. Seriously, they shouldn't have put these songs next to each other on the CD. It's hard to differentiate between them.<br />9. &quot;Naked&quot; - Like the title, this song is really rather odd. The music's not bad at all, and it's actually a pretty good song, except for the little rap bit.<br />10. &quot;If You Can't Dance&quot; - D'oh! Horrible song to close an album with. It's just plain NOT GOOD! I suppose it could be good to dance to in a club or something... nah, I just can't say anything good about this song.

B000000WFF|5.0|I don't care that this is going to make everyone think I'm uncool... this is a fun CD! I enjoy it very much! It's fun pop, and that's all it's supposed to be!<br />1. &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; - Catchy as hell. I'm sure you've already heard it, so enough said.<br />2. &quot;Stop&quot; - Pop, but with a more R&amp;B sound to it. A MINOR R&amp;B sound, mind you, but it's still there!<br />3. &quot;Too Much&quot; - This is a very unique, sultry-sounding song. Not the usual Spice Girls.<br />4. &quot;Saturday Night Divas&quot; - Yet another catchy pop song. And, yes, this time I'll admit that it's PURE, sugary, pop. But that doesn't mean it's not fun!<br />5. &quot;Never Give Up On the Good Times&quot; - This is a more &quot;mature&quot; song. Sure, it's still pop, but it's pop with a message.<br />6. &quot;Move Over&quot; - AKA the Pepsi commercial song. I hated this at first, but it really grew on me. This may be the most poppy song on the whole CD, though, so be warned!<br />7. &quot;Do It&quot; - My least favorite song, musically, but the lyrics are good. The funny thing is that I dislike this song because it moves away from the usual pop formula.<br />8. &quot;Denying&quot; - This is a really good song. Again, it IS pop, but it rally has a strong sound to it.<br />9. &quot;Viva Forever&quot; - The album's only ballad. I, personally, like it, but it doesn't sound very Spice-y at all. <br />10. &quot;The Lady Is A Vamp&quot; - Another least favorite track. It has a jazzy sound to it that just bothers me. The Girls should stick to what they do best: bubblegum pop!
B00000DGUG|4.0|I brought this due to the fact i liked Jagged Little Pill so much and i have got to say im delighted with it and i dont agree with many others who said it is a big dissapointment.Alanis has opted for a more experimental approach to this album and and put in many different aspects to her music which i personaly think is what scared alot of people off.The couch and Sympathetic Character are fine examples of this The Couch using tribal drums and odd beats over her unique voice and Sympathetic Character uses computery noises weaved in an out of the track making it very interesting.<BR> Front Row,Joining You and Baba are on the egde typical Alanis Morissette songs and could have come straight off Jagged Little Pill they have a rock feel and unusual lyrics.So Pure has a very Madonna Beautiful Stranger vibe to it making it a standout track.Thank You the first single lifted from the album is very different from what she has done before and has a very relaxing and interesting side to it.The real highlight is That i Would Be Good and simple song which i think is more vocal based than music.The music is seems distant to her vocals which take lead priority.Their are seventeen tracks which i think is over generous which two do sound very b~side such as Your Congratulation and One but overall this is a very good follow up to a incredible debut which many people didnt thrink she would do and some still dont htink she has.Lyrically is brilliant if not weird in some places musically its outstanding Alanis is a musician that has every right to be counted for as a serious musical artist.Its been four years since this album was released and her new album 'Under Rug Swept'is due to be released on 26th February 2002 which i think she will come up with another cracking album.Take a tip if you brought Jagged Little Pill then buy this you are missing out.
B000001Y79|4.0|This was the first CD I ever bought. Since then, I've pretty much only bought pop CDs, but I digress. What matters is that this is an incredible CD. I'm not even into this type of music anymore, but I can't bring myself to get rid of this, because the songs are so unique, and, well... good!<br />1. &quot;Spiderwebs&quot; - The first single from the CD, and the one that propelled this CD into the huge hit that it was. However, I didn't like it then, and I don't like it now. It's not as original as most of the songs on this CD.<br />2. &quot;Excuse Me Mr.&quot; - OK, so the CD is off to a bad start, as this song is nothing special either. It's filler.<br />3. &quot;Just a Girl&quot; - Now we're into the good stuff! One of the best tracks on the album, with it's funky beat and inspiring lyrics. <br />4. &quot;Happy Now?&quot; - A unique souding, bitter song. This song almost falls into the trap of being &quot;Excuse Me Mr.&quot;-type filler, but the upbeat, catchy chorus saves it.<br />5. &quot;Different People&quot; - This is one of the most original songs I've heard! It's unique beat and style really grow on you, and the lyrics are very interesting, too.<br />6. &quot;Hey You&quot; - The first few lines of this song are the best. That's not to say that the rest of the Oriental-soundng song isn't good... just that the beginning is the best.<br />7. &quot;The Climb&quot; - A much slower song than the rest of the album. I'd like this song a lot better if it weren't so long.<br />8. &quot;Sixteen&quot; - This is the most &quot;rock&quot; sounding song on the album, and my least favorite. <br />9. &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; - Another really unique song! This is one of my favorites, because the beat and the music are just incredible, and the vocals are nothing to scoff at either.<br />10. &quot;Don't Speak&quot; - This is the reason I bought the CD. It's a melancholy song with great music, and Gwen's voice sounds better than ever on this track.<br />11. &quot;You Can Do It&quot; - This is more filler. A very forgettable song... I seriously can't remember how it goes!<br />12. &quot;World Go 'Round&quot; - This song is a lot like &quot;Different People,&quot; only with a more &quot;socially concious&quot; message to it.<br />13. &quot;End It On This&quot; - A great, catchy song that sounds a little like &quot;Don't Speak,&quot; only more upbeat, despite the decidedly NOT upbeat lyrics.<br />14. &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; - Another one of the best, and most unique, tracks on the album. It's a parody of Disney World's Magic Kingdom. The music and beat to this song are incredible, and even the litten opening part is great. The albunm definitely ends on a high note!

6304779356|4.0|Ever, as a kid, have to move to a new town you knew nothing about?  And, when you got to that town there was something going on, something strange.. but you couldn't put a finger on it?<br />When I was a kid, I moved to a small town in North Dakota.. the people were elusive, even unfriendly.. and something was happening, but you just didn't know what.  Years later, two US Marshal's were killed in the area, and the town ended up in the national spotlight when the FBI converged into it searching for Gorden Kahl, who puportedly was hiding in the town after the killings.<br />This story appeals to me because of that, and because of the slow, yet building work up of the characters throughout the movie.<br />Two kids named Sam and Michael move into their grandfathers home in a town they  know nothing about.  During their stay they find out that many children are missing, presumed runaways by the authorities, and no one seems to be too interested in finding out the truth.  But, in the turn of events they discover the truth.<br />The star that shines in this film is Kiefer Sutherland, an initially dark character, seemingly in love with his motorcycle, and viciously protecting his claim on his girlfriend.  He is a bully, as are his motorcycle friends.  As we find out that, while they remain bullies, they have the &quot;advantage&quot; of being vampires to add to their criminal behavior.<br />Director Joel Schumacher took this movie, which could have been just a standard &quot;B&quot; fare, run in the mill teen horror picture, and rose it up to be funny, dark, and exciting.<br />Recommended for all of you conspiracy theory nuts and vampire fans.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the best comedies ever to grace a screen, its only rivial, would be Life of Brian (also a Monty Python movie).<br />If you don't know what this moive's about, you live in a cave and owe it to yourself to buy this right now.<br />This is about King Aurther of Camalot and his knights of the round table serching for the Holy Grail.  What insuses is a 2 hour comedy romp with memorable chearcters, witty and remembrable dialoge, and sene after sene of gut busting humor.<br />I can go on talking about this movie for ages.  This Special Edition DVD is one for the books.  The picture is the best I've ever seen of this movie and the sound is great.<br />The greatness of this DVD, exlucding the movie, is in its Extras.  The extras are enough to make a Monty Python fan weep and a worth the money purchas for the consumer.
014028009X|4.0|Anyone who has seen the movie version of this novel and liked that movie probably will like the written story even better.  And even people who found the film annoying may well find that they are more amused by the book.  BRIDGET JONES' DIARY is a fast-paced and clever concept that makes for entertaining reading.<br />DIARY was the volume that started the trend of &quot;City Girl&quot; plotlines, east side of the Atlantic series. (The<BR>west side of the Atlantic movement is headed by SEX &amp; THE CITY.) The print version of DIARY is funnier and quicker than the movie was, and some of the changes of detail which were made to have a film that was more correct politically damaged the pacing of the story.<br />DIARY is not unique; while it was early in the genre, there also are other, similar, works which are almost as good.  In fact, MAKING MINTY MALONE is so similar that it almost seems like the two authors must have written each of their manuscripts as part of an assignment for the same writing class.  Still, DIARY remains the dispositive work about the over-educated, urban, young and unmarried career woman in these opening years of the new millennium.
0553277472|5.0|This book in many ways helped me to piece together many ideas that I have had for some time. One is that the &quot;quality&quot; that Pirsig talks about is the same as Thelema. The key to it all is the realization of the Greek &quot;Arete&quot; which means excellence.<BR>The core of this book is excellence of self, and how to acheive that. Some people may not have gotten that aspect, but that is what it is all about. I would recomend this book to anyone. If you enjoy this book, then you might consider reading anything by Aleister Crowley.
0385505833|4.0|John Grisham has been one of my favorite author's over the years. The story of this book is something that a lot of people would want to do. Skip Christmas<br />Luther and Nora are a typical family. Taking a lot of time to celebrate Christmas and later regretting it. Luther at times in this book seem to get a little bit out of hand with the whole idea of skipping chrismas.<br />Overall the best parts of the book were the Frosty parts and of couse I loved the last 50 or so pages of the book.<br />This was a good quick read.
6305897786|5.0|In my opinion, this film is underrated. The pacing is perfect, as far as I'm concerned. This is simply a film that is not influenced by MTV.<br />The ending, the first time I saw it, seemed too abrupt. However, the more I see it, the more I get it. If the story told you what happened next, you'd miss the underlying message of the ending:<br />YOU are what happens next.<br />The door opened for Johnny Depp's character is open to anyone brave enough (or foolish enough) to walk through.<br />Regarding the woman who doesn't reveal her name, may God bless her thoughout this Age of humanity. If you need to know who she is, try looking in the Book of the Revelation of St. John the Divine.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Yes is true.. the story lacks the power and enchantment of the original movies, but this dvd rocks!!, is maybe the best sounding movie i ever seen, the picture is awesome and the extras are the best.
B00005OWEG|3.0|This is one of my favorite films of all time. It might have earned more stars had I not seen The original 3 times in 70mm with six track sound when it first came out in 1979. The image and sound were incredible. After seeing it in 35mm, VHS and DVD I was thrilled to read an interview with editor Walter Murch last spring that they were working on restoring the film to best reflect Coppola's original vision. There is no theater near me that has 70mm projection equipment so I had to be content with a 35mm print. For the most part the added scenes work really well, but the color balance for the film, even the original scenes, was all over the place. I thought that when the DVD transfer was done, major discrepancies would be corrected as the transfer would be done from the 70mm original. Boy was I wrong. The color ranges from very good to downright awful. Add to that the trimming of the frame from 2.35:1 to 1.85:1. At least the sound is consistently excellent. I would not hesitate to buy a special edition package that includes the superb &quot;Hearts of Darkness&quot; documentary as long as the film is given its visual due. Put it on a double sided, dual layer DVD with an intermission to lower the compression and put any extra stuff on another disc. Coppola's friend George Lucas could undoubtedly supervise a flagship transfer of this extraordinary movie.
B00005RFAI|5.0|The reviewer before me said that this album is only for hard-core Pink fans.<br />I totally disagree. I'm still not sure WHY I bought the CD, but boy am I ever glad I did! I was not familiar with any of Pink's previous work, but I can't make myself take this CD out of my player. I happen to like what she's saying, and how she's saying it. I'm not into dance music, so maybe that makes all the difference. I highly recommend this CD.
0385505833|5.0|John Grisham's &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; shows he is more than an author of legal thrillers. As a fan of &quot;The Pelican Brief,&quot; I wondered if he could pull off a Christmas book. He has pulled it off.<br />&quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is not Charles Dickens. Still, he grabs at the reader to consider the important of Christmas, and jabs at the superficiality of the typical Christmas protocols.<br />Never disregarding the true values of Christmas, Grisham wields his pen through a terrific tale of parody and fiction, so close to the reality many of us face durinf the holiday season.<br />So, as you rush out to the mall to buy the sausage sampler for your Uncle Lou, dropping by the hardware store for some outlet multipliers for your tree lights, pick up a copy of &quot;Skipping Christmas.&quot;<br />I fully recommend &quot;Skipping Christmas.&quot;<br />Anthony Trendl
0140277447|5.0|I used to play Dungeons&amp;Dragons many many moons ago.<br /> Just picking this book up and flipping thu it, I was repulsed and horrified. I had to open up my old Dungeon Masters Manual and remember the item called the Book of Vile Darkness. That is how the images left their impression on me.<br />The Japanese commited an atrocity many more times depraved than what the Jews mostly endured, but yet, ask most people what they know of the Pacific campaign during WWII - usually only the old-timers can tell you what it was all about.<BR> Now I can only imagine what the Americans had to endure during the Bataan Death March and on the hell boats as POWs.<br />Pictures of Japanese soldiers using Chinese citizens as bayonet practice - contests to see who could behead the most Chinese - rape and prostitution of the women, huge round-ups of the men to be taken and shot - beheadings with grinning Japanese soldiers standing triumphantly.<br />Without reading the book, I know more about Nanking then I want to. The images tell a thousand words. You only have to take a look at the Japanese soldier on the cover to know it was horrible.<br />I give this book 5 stars only to draw people's attention to it, and for people to be aware of none-to-distant events that have been mostly successful to repress. I want to learn more, but I shall start of by understanding all I can about the WWII campaign first. The Rape of Nanking is much to horrifying to begin with.
0786867973|5.0|&quot;How to Be a Domestic Goddess: Baking and the Art of Comfort Cooking&quot; is a delicious look at foods that matter.<br />I'm a guy. I like sports, action movies, steak and other things stereotyping my gender. However, I like food. While I'm no domestic goddess (nor do I esteem to be one), I prefer the aroma and taste of a food made within the confines of my home. Restaurants are too ... too ... Well, they sort of seem to filter out the best parts of a meal. Restaurant biscuits might tastes wonderful, but they lack that sublime domestic elegance of the one my oven in my apartment provides.<br />You've got your good-for-you food, and you've got your &quot;I'm starving; fill me up quick&quot; food. In &quot;How to Be a Domestic Goddess: Baking and the Art of Comfort Cooking&quot; Lawson gives us the food we want to eat, and how to make it.<br />Hmm. No, she doesn't give us the food. That's where we come in.<br />The pleasure of making a food is almost as good as eating it, and helping someone else enjoy the extacy of a well-baked  delicacy is unbelieving satisfying.<br />I fully recommend &quot;How to Be a Domestic Goddess: Baking and the Art of Comfort Cooking.&quot;<br />Anthony Trendl
B00003CXXJ|4.0|This movie is funny as heck, and intelligent, and has enough pop culture references to keep any kid scratching their head, while you laugh your tushie off. Oh, and the extra features are nice, too.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Wow. I listen to this all the time. The songs are so inspiring and to tell the truth, I think in one way or another anyone, I mean anyone, can relate to a song on this album. Darren and Daniel have so much talent writing all these.<br />1. Affirmation- This song just tells beliefs and well...affirmations! Most of these I agree with like: \\"I believe the grass is no more greener on the other side\\" and \\"I believe you don't know what you've got until you've said good-bye\\" One \\"I believe....\\" ones my sister really likes: \\"I believe that junk food taste so good because it's bad for you\\"<br />2. Hold Me- Wow. This song just says that someone's having trouble in a relationship or they feel that close anymore and they're confused and lonely and all that want is to be held. Everybody needs to be held. This song is awesome. My favorite part is the second verse \\"More than angry words I hate this silence....\\" \\"I never been the praying kind, lately I've been down upon my knees not looking for a miracle, just a reason to believe....\\"<br />3. I Knew I Loved You- Everyone knows this song! This song basically talks about love at first sight. The chorus- everybody knows! Well I think...<br />4. The Best Thing- This song is so catchy! They're just saying that the best thing about them is that \\"special person\\". The first time I listened to this song, I already knew the chorus.<br />5. Crash and Burn- This song is the reason I even bought this album. I mean, I can really feel what Darren's singing. All the time. You're not alone when you feel lonely. It's inspiring.<br />6. Chained to You- If you like Madonna...her name's metioned in here! Well, it's just saying like \\"I'm clicked to you! I'm not gonna leave\\" It's a cool upbeat song.<br />7. The Animal Song- This song just explains that animals are free and they do whatever. No rules, just live life. I'm not saying being a human (...is bad), being a human is cool!....<br />8. The Lover After Me- This song is when you break up with somebody and the pain will never ever leave. But your \\"special person\\" (there goes those words again) just like \\"We broke up, that's it, no affect on me\\" It's sad. It's a great song.<br />9. Two Beds and a Coffee Machine- I repeat this song over and over again. It's my favorite. It's about a woman in an abusive relationship and she's confused. It's just so sad. The piano is beautiful and Darren's voice just haunts me....(not in a bad way y'know) It's so beautiful. It just says, even though you're in a tough situation you can make it. You KNOW you're gonna make it. This is a tear jerker I think. Make's your heart swell up. I love this song so much.<br />10. You Can Still Be Free- I think what's it's saying is you fel trapped but \\"you can still be free\\" Darren's vocals go super high on this though but it's great. This song is awesome.<br />11. Gunning Down Romance- It just says that they've been betrayed in love, all they got was misery in love, but it's still a great song. I love the last words on here: \\"I'm gonna take this broken wings,and learn to fly\\"<br />12. I Don't Know you Anymore- It's saying that their relationship isn't going very well, that they hardly know each other anymore. Another piano song, but great.<br />Like I said, buy this album if you want talent! Words can't explain! So I might as well end this review. Hope this helped you.
0790743507|5.0|Singin' in the Rain is one musical that even all musical haters cannot ignore. This musical I feel has everything that a musical should have. The great songs \\"Good Morning,\\" \\"You are my lucky Star\\" and of course the title track are forever timeless classics. The film is about Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont who are big movie stars of the silent era. Thank goodness for the film called The Jazz Singer because the silent movie world is all about to change. The Jazz Singer is a \\"talkie\\" and the silent movie actors find themselves undergoing singing and speech lessons so they can make their \\"talkie\\" movie. Don Lockwood passes but Lina Lamont cannot be a successful talkie actress. This film also shows us a romantic side of Lockwood and a showgirl named Kathy Seldon. Kathy pretends that she does not know who he is or anything about him, but we later find out that she knows everything about Don. Kathy and Don end up falling in love with each other. Later on Lockwood sees Kathy as a strong chorus girl who can overdue Lamont's voice, but Lamont tries her best to break them up. This films humor is hilarious but at times a bit cruel. A lot of it is at the expense of Lamont, because of her annoying voice and inability to sing and dance she is ridiculed throughout this film. Singin' in the Rain features some extraordinary dances ever filmed. One of my favorites would be during the Make `Em Laugh scene which is performed by Cosmo Brown. This number is a reason alone to see this film. The dances choreographed by Gene Kelley are very entertaining. The film also contains plenty of humor, especially where Don is talking about his early movie career to the press as having everything, while we see images of his past that are not really glamorous at all, as Cosmo and Don are being rejected just about anywhere. This film has a rather sweet ending as Don is singing \\"You are my lucky Star\\" to Kathy in front of hundreds of movie fans. It shows his love for Kathy is so strong. I would recommendthis film to anyone whether they are a musical fan or not. If you are ever in the mood for a fun and entertaining musical  I would recommend you rent Singin' in the Rain.
B00005LC1H|5.0|There are very few comedies I would put in the gut-busting funny category, and this series is one of the few.  I inadvertently caught the entire series a LONG time ago during a PBS marathon, and I was, in all honesty, in pain from laughing so hard.  I'm not a big fan of Monty Python, so this type of humor appealed to me more:  Not as reliant on obscure British references, but crafted in a way that can be widely appreciated by a more varied American audience.  Think &quot;Newhart&quot; on steroids. Great, great caustic, physical/slapstick humor that's made even funnier by a fantastic cast.  This stuff loses no appeal with repeated viewings; in fact, these episodes are as funny the 10th time you watch them as they are the first.  I will be replacing my VHS tapes with this DVD edition REAL soon.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Well, Pearl Harbor comes out to DVD today, Dec. 4th.  Just 3 days before the ACTUAL historical bombing.  I wonder if they are going to do some kind of special on TV or something in light of the Sept. 11th events.<br />I don't know about some of the people on this board, but I'm going to buy the Pearl Harbor DVD.  It was a good movie (in my opinion), and the DVD has plenty of features.  Even some historical features for you historical buffs out there.  <br />THe rated-R version (DIrector's CUt) DVD is coming out next year, and that one is supposed to be spectacular. 3 disks, with LOADS of historical footage, behind the scenes of the movie, and all this other stuff.

068484267X|5.0|What stains and is a lifeless form? An ash. In Angela's Ashes, there were many ashes scattered in the form of tragedies. Life as it was in the Irish Catholic community of Limerick was extremly harsh in the 1930's. It was particularly cruel to the impoverished as it was for the McCourts.   <BR>     This unforgettable story was written though the eyes of Frank McCourt, the oldest son of the family who depicted the squalid conditions he and his family had to endure. He describes his family that journeys through misfortune and overcomes incredible odds. The ashes that are left behind include losing two twin brothers and a baby sister to typhoid fever. The permanency of the dark ash comes out very clearly as the young Frankie attempts in becoming a man at the tender age of ten when he comes to the realization that his dad is a hopeless drunkard incapable of supporting the family. More ashes cover Frank McCourt's essence as he watches his mother Angela, beg on the streets, turn to antagonizing relatives and surrender her body to an abusive man in order to ensure the survival of her children.<BR>     No better example of resiliency of the human heart is conveyed than in this true story of Angela's Ashes. A story that takes you through the anguish pains of motherhood, the humiliation of being without basic needs, the mysteries behind the religious rituals, but most important of all is attaining the dream of a young writer.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This one is worth buying for any fan of the Star Wars franchise.<br />That said, as a film, George has left much to be desired (and some to be rebuffed, eg. Jar Jar). Science Fiction fans unfamiliar with Star Wars (as if they existed) would still like this one, but the general viewing public would probably be disappointed in the relative weakness present, especially versus the other films from George Lucas.<br />However, and this is a *big* however: this review is for the DVD, which transfer is among the most amazing ever. Sound is impeccable, video fantastic, and the extra features, including bonus footage originally cut but finished specifically for this DVD, are to die for. Its quite an unreal package for DVD genre enthusiasts, though no Nuon features (unless perhaps in easter-egg format).<br />Enjoy another film from Uncle George, even if it is just good and not great, that will look great and sound better.
B00005QK3W|5.0|...maybe then people we would be able to listen to an album open minded.  But, Paul is Paul, John Lennon's partner, founder of Wings, a friggin BEATLE for God's sake...it's hard not to expect too much.<br />Yet, this album is good enough anyway.  If Paul had produced his last two albums incognito, (I am thinking about &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; and &quot;Driving Rain&quot; here) and suddenly died, reviewers the world over would be lamenting the forshortened career of an under apreciated artist.  But this is Paul McCartney, and everything is judged by Penny Lane and Revolver.  Not gonna happen.  Can't...this isn't the 60's and none of us are removing the sleepy dew of the 50's from our eyes.<br />So, on its own, this is a great album.<br />Like Jagger, Paul attempts to cover a number of musical genres here, but Paul's effort feels a little less forced.  contrary to most expectations, this album isn't 64 minutes of Paul bemoaning Linda's death.  &quot;Lonely Road&quot; clearly gets that job done, and rather ably at that.<br />There is a darkness to this album, lacking the silliness of &quot;Press to Play&quot; or the rawness of &quot;Flaming Pie,&quot; but maybe that's its strength.  Paul plays with a small 4 or 5 piece group for most of this album, staying away from his proclivity for massive over production.<br />Overall this is a hip, modern sounding album - with a refreshingly minimalist feel.  It's also very good.

B00005OM4N|5.0|This is the best cd Britney has ever recorded as far as I'm concerned. It's more mature and her voice sounds the best. I'm a Slave 4 U is a good song, but definatly not the best on the album.  Overprotected and Lonely are great songs, and I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Women is probably the best ballad she has ever done.  Boys is good, and Anticipating is also an awesome song(I think it's one of the best songs on the album, along with Lonely and What It's Like to Be Me). I Love Rock n' Roll is also(surprise, surprise) cool song, but I liked her cover of Satisfaction better.  Cinderella, Let Me Be, Bombastic Love, and That's Where You Take Me are all good, but the song that stands out the most is What It's Like To Be Me, which was written and produced by Brit's boyfriend Justin.I think it's the best song on the album.

0679720200|4.0|This short novel by Albert Camus was written in 1946.  It's about a young Algerian Frenchman, Muersault, who works at an office job and lives a dull ordinary life.  He describes his mother's funeral with clarity and dispassion and, as the story unfolds, the reader sees that this detachment is the general theme of the book.  He doesn't love his girlfriend but it makes no difference to him whether he marries her or not.  He helps an acquaintance commit an aggressive act because he just doesn't care enough one way or another.  And, eventually, he commits a murder and is arrested.  The trial then focuses on this disaffected aspect of his character.  The conclusion is inevitable.<br />I found this book quite uncomfortable reading.  As Muersault observed the world around him, I was caught up in it, found myself seeing it all through his eyes, trapped in his inertia. I entered his world and felt a weird kind of sympathy as well as identification with him.  This was very troubling. The little book packs quite a wallop.<br />Yes, I do see this book as a work of art.  Every word resonates with double and triple meanings.  And every word is like a hammer blow.  I read it fast, trying to shake off its impact.  That didn't work, however, because &quot;The Stranger&quot; will linger long in my mind.  This is the philosophy of essentialism and the book is a classic.  I just can't help the fact that I hated it.
B000059TPN|5.0|This was probably, no, definately the best movie I have ever seen.  Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery are two of my favorite actors and they [were great] in this movie.  <BR>    It's about a group of marines who are mad at the U.S for not honoring dead soldiers who died in battle.  The marines steal missiles loaded with a chemical weapon, and hide out on alcatraz island. Two men (an ex convict from alcatraz, and a chemical weapons specialist) and a group of Navy seals set out onto the island to destroy the weapons and take down the marines.  <BR>   When every thing goes wrong, Cage and Connery must work together to defeat the marines and disable the deadly weapons.
0553579908|5.0|George RR Martin cements himself in as one of the greatest writers with this series. It has all the depth we have come to expect in a long fantasy series. It has no filler whatsoever. This is also the only series that even as it unfolds leaves you with no idea as to what the end will be like! You don't know who will live or who will be in power....Wow. Also, his strictly POV writing is superb, I found it impossible not to identify with the characters, even those who I didn't like before getting their POV. It keeps you on the edge up until the last page and makes it impossible not to order the next book as soon as you close it....

B00005RFAI|5.0|I first heard and saw Pink's video &quot;I'm Coming Out&quot; on MTV while channel surfing one evening.  The slick entertaining song stayed with me longer than the other videos I watched afterwards on MTV's programming called &quot;Spankin New.&quot; Later that week I found myself in a music store rifling through various musical categories looking for PINK!.  Finally I found it in the Rap section? I am not a Rap fan but I took a gamble and bought it,  after only hearing one song ever from Pink.<br />Ever since I bought the CD less than a week ago I've probably listened to it from start to finish 6 to 7 times.  I really really like it!  I am not a music critic but I simply enjoy music for music.  The first six songs on the CD are on the &quot;up tempo&quot; side while the later eight songs are ballad tunes.  At first I was expecting the entire CD to sound like &quot;I'm Coming Up&quot;, not to be disappointed I gave it a chance and found the slower songs satisfying and wanting more.  <br />I'm forty-something and I typically would not find myself drawn to musical artists whose target audience is high schoolers or twenty year olds, but I get tired of oldies and adult contemporary and I was looking for something different.  Pink's music reflects that &quot;bad girl&quot; stuff which I liked a lot in 70's female artists.  I really hope that she sticks around for awhile and her &quot;new&quot; direction (as some people say) I think makes Pink! accessible to a wider variety of listeners.

This pleasant and quick-to-read tale is a MUST for anyone who needs to take some time out during the holidays for a little bit of &quot;brain candy.&quot;  I took this book with me on vacation with me last week and was able to read it within a day.<br />Grisham is a comedian, it's a nice breath of fresh air.

0385486804|5.0|I've read this remarkable book twice in the past few years. I think of it often; I was most recently reminded of it by the story of John Walker Lindh, the California man who was found in Mazar-i-Sharif with the Taliban. <BR>I've known several people like Chris McCandless, who sought purification and transcendence in the wild (or in other extreme pursuits). I even recognize a streak of it in my younger self. In fact, the power of this book comes in part from Krakauer's ability to show how deeply ingrained these ideas are in the myth of America, and how universal the urge is, at least among young men.<BR>He accomplishes this, in part, through an analysis of his subject's character- notably, focusing on McCandless's literary preferences, which ran to such authors as Tolstoy, Jack London, and Thoreau. Even more illuminating are the parallels he draws with other seekers of transcendent experience, including an incident from his own youth.<BR>Though Krakauer strives to make Chris sympathetic, to his credit he generally resists the temptation to romanticize his subject- not always an easy task, given the panoramic backdrop against which the story plays out. However, Krakauer's intention seems, in part, to warn against the tendency to romanticize nature. Its vastness and power don't exist to challenge us, or to vanquish us or to nurture us. <BR>The wilderness simply is.<BR>It won't reward us for our virtues, or punish us for our sins. And though one might argue that McCandless was guilty of hubris, that isn't really what killed him. His death occurred, as do most accidents, as the result of a multitude of decisions and events. Some were predictable and avoidable, others weren't. But a change in any one or two might have allowed Chris to walk out of the wild unscathed- probably to write a best-selling book about his experiences.<BR>By turns a mystery, a wilderness adventure, a coming-of-age story and more, the tale is fascinating from start to finish. Though it's frustratingthat we can't determine, with absolute certainty, the reason for McCandless's death, Krakauer confronts this head-on and provides a plausible solution. Far more mysterious, and intractable, is the question of what drives such a person. Perhaps we'll never be able to isolate the source of this impulse, or why certain people seem compelled to heed its call. If Chris McCandless were alive today, and were to search deep into his soul, maybe the best answer he could find would be, &quot;Because it's there.&quot;
0060207051|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  My mother bought this book last Christmas for my almost 2 year old and it is his favorite book.  We have to read it all the time.  He is starting to tell us the story.  We take forever to read because we have to point out everything in the pictures and discuss what they are.  This is the only book he'll sit through from beginning to end and over and over again.  This is a must have book for toddlers.
B0000042MY|5.0|Usually one sees a movie, loves the soundtrack, and then buys the CD only to discover the two aren't even close to being the same. True here as well, but this CD is better than what was in the film. Now, if it were only available in SACD.
0451169514|4.0|DON'T BELIEVE WHAT ANYONE SAYS ABOUT THE &quot;BAD&quot; ENDING!!!!!!  <br />If you're like me, you read the bad reviews first.  Well, first and foremost, let me warn you against that practice with this book, for the sole reason that most of the bad reviews spoil the ending.  More on that in a moment.  <br />However, if you must know what people don't like about this book, here are the only three complaints: 1. The ending is &quot;stupid&quot;. More on that in a moment. 2. It's too obscene. Near the &quot;stupid&quot; ending, there is a scene that offended ME (which is pretty hard unless you know what buttons to push) concerning very perverted sexuality.  It's very short, and actually doesn't fit in with the rest of the book, so don't let that throw you off. And 3. It's too long. That's true. The book is over 1000 pages long, but that's actually a good thing in this case. It's very detailed to epic proportions. Give yourself a summer for this one. It's worth (almost) every page. There you have it. The bad reasons. No need to read the bad reviews and have the book spoiled. <br />Now for the ending. I called this book &quot;lovecraftian&quot; because it's in the grand tradition of the great horror pioneer H.P. Lovecraft. Anyone who has read his work, which I STRONGLY advise, will know just how excellent the ending really is. Don't be thrown off by unimaginative philistines who take everything at face value. Just read the short story &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; by Lovecraft, and you'll be ready for this book's ending. <br />IT is one of the most imaginative, and detailed of Stephen King's work. The Shining, The Stand, and The Dark Tower are the only things above it. The direct simplicity of his prose makes me want to write myself. He isn't Joyce, he isn't Dickens, and he isn't Lovecraft either, but he's close. He's a writer for the masses, and he writes what the masses want, and he does it beautifully. Don't expect any life-lessons here, just a movie with pages. An excellent book. A bit slow to start, but stick with it. <br />Oh, and DON'T WATCH THE MOVIE!!! It's hideous garbage.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac, the follow up to Kid A, got mixed reviews from critics, which dissapointed me. After buying the album, I immediately found that not since OK COMPUTER (Radiohead), had I heard such a melodic masterpiece. Amnesiac takes OK COMPUTER and Combines it with KID A with a resulting new age music that doesn't use too many sound effects, which was the case with KID A. All of the tracks are very good, but after listening to LIFE IN A GLASS HOUSE, I couldn't believe that a human could write such good music. If you're a die hard Radiohead fan, you'll love this album. If you're not a die hard Radiohead fan, you'll love this album. If you have ears, you'll LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!
B00000DHR0|5.0|you really have it all on that album from simple melody to incredible power balads. Each songs are special in their way and there's no doubt that Celine is the biggest singer in the whole world when you listen to that cd.With falling into you and D'eux, this album is a real classic. Songs like Ave maria, another year as gone by and oh holy night are among the best of this album but there's plenty of others. You have to discover that christmas cd and you'll find after why Celine's voice is one of the most popular sound on earth. By the way, Celine's comeback album is due to March 2002!!So until that moment, Thes are special times is the perfect gift for yourself or for christmas.......happy holidays everyone
B00005NW02|5.0|First off, someone mentioned that this album's melodies were in a weird Arabic style which he thought was a wrong orientation after 9.11.  [Stop] that thinking.  I write Middle Eastern influenced riffs every now and then, but it doesn't make it music that people might not want to hear.  But anyways, while some people think the album's not as good as the first, I think it might be a bit bette, not by much, but it's a different album too.  Different styles were used, and more speed and palm muting was used too.  Who cares if it's solo-less.  Though Nirvana had some solos in their songs, how complex were their songs?  not very.  How far and deep reaching was their music?  Very far and deep.  It's about the whole picture.  If pentatonic solo [stuff] doesn't fit in with the song, then toss the solo, not the song.  I will definetely look forward to what they do next, especially with newer sounding songs like Needles, Chop Suey!, ATWA, Toxicity and Aerials.  Also, if you can find them, get the b-sides [...]the system, Innervision, and Blue.
B00005ATQ8|5.0|I love this film because it is like watching several films at one time. There is the picaresque story of Barry Lyndon, full of love, duels, highway robbery, war, card sharping, and swindling the rich. But while Barry is busy being victim to roguery and then becoming one himself Kubrick also sets out to study society which in his view is completely corrupt from top to bottom. So there is a kind of comedy and tragedy going on simultaneously. Its brilliantly well blended. You find yourself laughing at Barrys antics one minute and then that famous Kubrick camera will pull back and show you the rest of the larger picture quite literally. It is about as unsentimental a potrait of society and human nature as exists on film. Perhaps Kubrick is saying that it is the society we are born into that does the corrupting or perhaps he is saying we are all by nature corrupt, you can make up you own mind. You will have plenty of time to decide(3+ hours) but you will not be bored. As costume epics go this one has plenty of adventure, from battlefield scenes to drawing room intrigue, and all takes place in a period detail rich atmosphere. Most period dramas feel like they over romanticize the epoch they are recreating this does just the opposite. Kubrick shows the literal dirt as well as the dirty underside of his characters. The music is perfect too, as it always is in Kubrick works. Schuberts Trio in E-flat has been used in other movies but I believe nowhere has it been used more appropriately, here it is the sound of life naturally and inevitably following its predetermined course.  A predictable course is the human course in this film because human nature is without fail drawn away from light and into dark deceit. Barry begins so innocently and in the beginning he is so easily duped but by the end he has learned that there are only two kinds of humans, those who deceive and those who are deceived. Not my world view but it does make for an intensely enjoyable few hours. One of those movies that are so good you want to compare the experience to reading but of course Kubrick says as much with the way he frames his shots as many novelists do with words. Great cinema.  Ryan Oneal doesn't seem the obvious choice for this role but its hard to think of someone who could have done it better. You can't help but like him because you believe he does what he does and becomes what he becomes because he just doesn't know any better. Ryan Oneal has that kind of untouched by the world innocence, and also a very good confused and hopelessly lost look. Both are crucial for the role. Each character actor, and there are many, is better than the last. And Marisa Berenson a very memorable beauty.e movies that are so good you want to compare the experience to reading but of course Kubrick says as much with the way he frames his shots as many novelists do with words.

B00005KHL5|5.0|This movie which I have seen many times now gets written up every Halloween as being one of the best horror films of all time and it is. This year the New York Times did a piece about it and sang its praises. If you haven't seen it don't read any further and see it before learning about all its secrets. I've been reading here about different versions of the movie and I agree with the person who said it doesn't matter which version you see. I rent it about once a year and even if the copy I get is old and has imperfections its still The Wicker Man. Christopher Lee as Lord Summersisle does what Christopher Lee always does better than any one else, he plays the Christopher Lee part, the kind of part he made famous. Equally memorable is Britt Ekland who is used exactly as Britt Ekland should be used, though it was revealed in the N.Y. Times article that its not really Britts bits we are seeing but a body double. Anyway she is earthy and innocent and beautiful and does a dance in the moonlight and any detective investigating a disappearance on a Scottish isle would fall for her.  The island is gorgeous, the innkeepers daughter is gorgeous, the inn is well stocked, the rooms are quaint, and it just happens to be the time of year on Summersisle when certain traditions are observed. A good time of year to visit.<br />One of the best moments in the early going is while the detective is making enquiries at the inn and suddenly everyone breaks into song. A strange song he has never heard with strange lyrics that everyone knows, but him. Something is not right on Summersisle. The man to see is of course Lord Summersisle. The finale in the streets of the macabre village and on its gentle slopes overlooking the sea is like so much of this picture, easily recalled. You will make a ritual of watching this every year.
0385505833|5.0|I found this book a little slow to get into but I am a Christian who celebrates a religious Christmas and some of it was wearing a little thin by midbook. The end was what I saw comming, but it was even better.  I could see Chevy Chase or Dan Akroyd and Bette Midler in this as a perfect holiday film. This is an excellent gift to the scrooge in your family.<br />Only point in the book that was oddly very inaccurate (shame on someone) is that Methodists do not call their ministers &quot;Father&quot; as the Krank's do in this book.  Roman Catholics and high church Episcopalians, but not Methodists as far as I ever heard.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie excited me when I saw it because it was the first major movie playing at cineplexes that seemed to criticise corporate consumer society. There are issues of class (as in economic), questions about quality of life, and a critique of modern society like none I have seen in a movie with this distribution. You'd expect it from an indie film usually. <BR>There is some irony that it was released by a major movie company and Brad Pitt is the main ego, Tyler Durdun. When Pitt's character criticizes the image of mans toned physique in a CK ad on a bus, one has to laugh. Pitt is exactly the kind of image that his character hates, but oh well. The point of the movie, the message, is still retained. <BR>In light of recent events (Sep.11th), a film about home grown terrorists is probably not too popular. Never the less, Tyler Durden and company remind us all that we &quot;...are not the contents of your wallet, your car, your income, or your khakis.&quot;<br />Amen.
B00004TH83|5.0|I will always remember the first time I heard this incredible singer. I was at (local store) and it was at a listening station.  I was blown away by her power and emotional depth.  I have never had that kind of a reaction to a singer before.  In over a year since the purchase, I have played that CD so many times I'm surprised it still even works.  And it never grows old on me.  While the music may not be the most complex, and some may even say banal ( which I disagree with ) her ability to interperet the lyrics so well brings so many colors to the songs every time I hear it.  She is truly a gifted artist and hopefully she will get the credit she truly deserves.  Now I have basically every recording she has done.

B00003CXXS|5.0|Jurassic Park III was definitely the best of the summer blockbusters, though it got very underrated. This is a sequal...what more could you expect? A huge dramatic film? I think not. This is Jurassic Park...duh! Jurassic Park III had a great cast list, including the talents of Sam Neill (who starred in the first Jurassic Park movie), William H. Macy, Tea Leoni, Trevor Morgan, and even a cameo role by Laura Dern (who also starred in the first one). I liked Jeff Goldblum better as a supporting character in Jurassic Park more than the leading character in The Lost World. Sam Neill is the real star of the Jurassic Park trilogy!<br />The plot of this movie is very simple and straight-forward, which makes it easier for audiences to concentrate more on the awesome action, special effects, and the dinosaurs! Also, it's easy for most people to understand.(...) <br />The only bad thing about this movie was that it was too short! (...) The other two movies had been over two hours long, but Jurassic Park III was only about 92 minutes long. Also, the ending was okay, but it was a little bit cheesy. Still, I enjoyed Jurassic Park III. It was the best movie I saw all summer long. Plus, the ending didn't really seem complete. Perhaps a 4th Jurassic Park movie is in the works? Jurassic Park III has some of the best special effects all summer long. JP3's special effects were even better than the special effects in movies like Planet of the Apes, The Mummy Returns, and Pearl Harbor! And the DVD for this movie looks really great, too with some very cool special features like behind-the-sceens, the making of the new dinosaurs, cast & crew interviews, etc. Joe Johnson did a great job as director and filled Steven Speilberg's shoes perfectly. This movie needs more recognization and credit! It was better than what most critics claimed it would be. If there's one movie you must rent on DVD this winter than it definitely has to be Jurassic Park III!
B00005N915|4.0|One of the greatest aspects about this film (to me) is that it is not quite a horror film, not quite a straight supernatural thriller and not totally a gritty detective movie either. It has elements of all three but does not stay consistently with the theme of any. The critics who called it \\"provocative and original\\" were correct because if nothing else, _Angel Heart_ is indeed those two things.<br />On the surface, the plot seems simple. A private investigator named Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is hired by Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to find a big band singer from the 1940s, Johnny Favorite. Angel is hesitant at first but he accepts the job because it pays well. From the beginning of the investigation, Angel learns that Favorite must have had plenty of secrets to hide. I don't want to give too much of the plot away so if you want to watch the film without knowing much about its twists and turns, don't read on. Anyhow, it seems that Favorite had powerful friends who took him out of the hospital he was staying at after the war and he disappeared. Because he had been badly injured, his face was still in bandages when he left so it was possible that Johnny didn't even look like Johnny anymore. As Angel probes deeper and deeper, dead bodies begin to pile up and Angel gets involved with Epiphany (Lisa Bonet), a voodoo priestess who could well be underhandedly included in a diabolical scheme with Favorite. In the film, Angel leaves New York for New Orleans to learn more about the occult practices Favorite was part of. This differs from the novel in which the setting stays in New York throughout. By the last twenty minutes of the film, the audience will discover the dark truth about Johnny Favorite at the same time (or maybe before if you've been paying attention) Angel does. <br />Mickey Rourke does an excellent job of portraying Harry Angel and Robert De Niro, though not an obvious choice for bringing to life the book's version of Louis Cyphre, is fantastic. De Niro plays Cyphre with such skill that even if you find the supernatural premise to be hokey or contrived, you will feel intimidated by his commanding prowess. As one reviewer already mentioned, the cinematography is excellent. The setting, lighting, and lack of bright, vibrant colors give the film a dark, noir feeling that it retains all the way through. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys trying to crack how movies will end, anyone who likes detective stories and anyone with an interest in the supernatural.
B00000J7JO|5.0|When I first started listening to this I had never been to California, so I didnt get the Point. To me it was just one good album by some band. Last summer I went to California and Los Angeles and when I got back home I got this feeling that I want to listen to this album again. So I put this cd to my cd-player... and wow! Now I could understand and feel what this is all about. As just good rock songs I like Around the World, Parallel Universe, Get On Top and Purple Stain best, but to get the feeling what Los Angeles is really about you gotta to listen to Californication, Scar Tissue and Purple Stain. The music is bit sad, confused but beautiful in its own rough way and the lyrics are just great with a little bit of irony. And the last song, Road Trippin is like a good-bye song, a real pearl.<BR>Youll like this if you like rock but youll love this if youve been to Los Angeles and seen that everything is not as it seems to be...
0876855575|5.0|A real revelation.  The 4th of the 4 autobiographical novels has<BR>Henry Chikovski (Mr Bukovski's alter ego) growing up in the tough<BR>Depression years (the 1930's not the 1990's).  From a 2 year old<BR>toddler crawling under a table to the incipient alcoholism of a <BR>soon-to-be man, we have a true picture of miserable, unloved, and<BR>violent childhood.  But it's funny.  Really funny.  (The chapter <BR>on ultimate acne will have you grimacing and grinning at the same<BR>time).  But be warned.  Like most authentic art, it can shock at<BR>times, though always for the better.  Enjoy the sandwich.
6303187064|5.0|The Crow is great!!!!<br />It's absouluty horrible what happend to Brandon Lee. He seemed like such a sweet man. (He was also HOT.) Anyway, the movie was great. It's amazing the way they put the movie together without him. The bad part is, the move is probably more known because of what happend to Brandon Lee then being a good movie. And also, thats probably the first thing that goes through someones mind when the move The Crow is mentiond. the song at the end of the movie is kind of weird, but it was nice and sweet. Is it supposed to be a dead lover talking to their lover thats still alive and telling them its going to be okay? And also, that song supposed to be a tribute to Brandon Lee and that Eliza? Anyway, I once saw a vidieo at a store along time ago, it was about Bruce Lee, and it was hosted by Brandon Lee and it also had scenes from Brandon Lee's funeral. Does anybody know about that vidieo? Please let me know if you do.<BR>God Bless the souls of Bruce and Brandon Lee.<BR>Chantell S.
0060926317|1.0|[This Book] is nothing more than a graceless rip-off, a conglomeration of new age nattering and patronizing egocentrism. It is as dishonest as it is poorly written. You'd be better off looking for life-changing philosophy on the greeting card racks at K-Mart. I just wish amazon.com allowed a \\"no-stars\\" choice.
B000021Y74|5.0|I just want to say that when I learned that my German class was going to watch Run Lola Run, I thought it would be another boring foreign movie. It was just the opposite. It left me on the edge of my seat the whole time and it has a triple bonus with three endings.I liked it so much that i went and got it immediately after I saw it. So go get it, you won't be disappointed.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|This movie isn't a \\"whodunit\\", it's a \\"whydunit\\".  We know how everything turns out, but it's the sequence of events that interests us.  And to this extent, the movie is a success in that it's really interesting to see how things came to that conclusion.<br />But it's not a happy movie -- it's about a guy hunting the killer of his wife -- and aside from a couple of darkly funny moments, there isn't much positive emotion from this movie.  In fact it gets darker as it goes on.  I can appreciate that if it's a means to end, like in Blade Runner, or if at least there's a big emotional payoff.  As it turns out it's neither.<br />The somewhat ambigious ending makes it even worse.  ...But why would I care what happened to these characters?  ALL of the characters are evil manipulative losers.  ...The whole experience for me was mild interest dropping into mild disgust.<br />And finally, the \\"theme\\" of the movie,... seems to be reminicent of \\"The Matrix\\" -- can you really trust your memories/senses?  Can you be sure of anything?  Pseudo-intellectuals love to parrot this garbage, because it's right -- you can't be sure of anything.  ...How is this knowledge going to affect your life?  ...Meditate for days on your enlightment?  No, you're going to keep going about life exactly the same as before, because odds are, the world around you is probably pretty much what it looks like, the past is probably pretty much how you remember, and in all likelihood there IS a spoon.  <br />...If you need a puzzle to solve and some lite philosophy to think about, you could have a winner here.  <br />Final verdict:  If I could not remember watching this movie, I'd be cool with that.
0871137380|5.0|Whether or not you're thinking of buying this book, I highly recommend you read it. It is a very real account of a battle that the vast majority of America knows nothing about. I remember when I learned of it, as I was spending nine months in Bosnia, I asked my parents if they knew anything about it, as I was only 15 at the time of the incident. Neither knew a thing about Somalia or what had happened there. In fact, not one person I know knew a thing about what happened in Somalia. Read this book, then learn more about the political decisions, and realize that as long as the military is used as a political tool, it will forever be hampered. My respects to those soldiers who took part in the mission, and hopefully with the release of the movie, Somalia will not be forgotten.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I first got into Incubus when they released SCIENCE and I thought it was awesome but not perfect.  Now their sound has really changed but it is for the better.  They've ditched the funky guitars and speedy vocals for impressive singing.  If you really liked Make Yourself, then this is the perfect cd for you.  It's got some fast songs like Nice to Know You and Circles which are similar to Privelige.  It also has slow soft songs too like Mexico and Echo which sound like the sequels to Drive and Stellar.  Are You In? is a really cool song that should be played at parties and barbecues cuz it has a really chill vibe to it.  Aqueous Transmission also shows more experimentation with a groovy Japanese theme.  Get this album if you need music to relax to.
0380789019|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend of mine who also likes off-beat fantasy. After reading it, I was sorely tempted to tell him that I had lost it so I could add it to my library of great fantasy books (sort of a personal lending library).  I did return it with great reluctance and plan to purchase the book in hardback (GASP) if I can. But I guess I should say why I liked it.<br />  Mr. Gaiman creates a shadow world which co-exists with ours.  He makes it come alive with creative and intersting characters. The book is by turns creepy, funny, fascinating, frightening, and thought provoking.  Just a wonderful read.
6304613199|5.0|Steven Spielberg returns to the world of the dinosaurs in this first sequel to his 1993 blockbuster JURASSIC PARK. It turns out that Isla Nublar, site of the original Jurassic Park, was only the finish line for the genetically engineered dinosaurs of eccentric billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough). On Isla Sorna, eighty-seven miles away, the dinosaurs flourish in their natural habitat. For four years, since the accident in Jurassic Park that killed several of his employees, Attenborough has been trying to keep this Lost World free from human interference. But the accident has resulted in his InGen firm being taken over by his thoroughly unscrupulous nephew (Arliss Howard). The only way Attenborough can mount enough public support for his retaking of InGen is a complete documentation of the dinosaurs in their original habitat.<br />Enter chaos mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who, along with two associates (Richard Schiff, Vince Vaughan) ventures to Isla Sorna, not just to check on the dinosaurs but also to look for his girlfriend, paleontologist Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), who is already down there.<br />The result is an action-packed and suspense-filled adventure as Goldblum and his team must outwit not only the dinosaurs (including the obligatory T-rex and velociraptors), but also slow down the progress of Howard's team, and to stop the mayhem that will erupt in the dinosaurs' climactic rampage through San Diego. <br />Coming off the extremely huge success of the original and the powerful triumph of SCHINDLER'S LIST is hardly the easiest task for a filmmaker to do; but then again, Spielberg is no ordinary filmmaker. He has created a sequel that expands on the original and adds some interesting twists to it.  John Williams' score and the usual great special effects from Industrial Light and Magic both help to make THE LOST WORLD a very good sequel to a stunning sci-fi/suspense masterpiece. JURASSIC PARK III, minus Spielberg's direction, would follow in 2001.
B000002U9W|5.0|Atom Heart Mother is not your normal Pink Floyd CD but it is my favorite and most listened to all because of the title song which lasts about 22 minutes.  It is much more a classical composition than rock.  What I find very unique about it is that even to the untrained ear, all the instruments can be heard quite clearly and distinctly.  The song is very melodic and soothing.  Absolutely great listening to it with headphones on.  I originally bought it when it first came out and I enjoy it as much now as I did then.
0393314804|5.0|Trainspotting, by Irvine Welsh, is a realistic fiction novel about Scottish lowlifes fighting friends, enemies, and an even crueler, more harmful force: heroin. The story focuses on one character in particular, Mark Renton, who continually battles this self-destructive addiction that constantly interferes with and impacts his life. In and out of his drug habit he must search for relationships, jobs, but most importantly any meaning his life or life itself might contain.<BR> The setting of Trainspotting varies throughout the story. The many characters travel all over Edinburgh, Scotland, and Leith. They live in the trashy parts of the cities staying with whomever they can and spending the rest of their time at various pubs. The specific year is never mentioned, but it appears to take place in the early nineties. The author, Irvine Welsh, has a unique way of using setting in the story. Although it's not completely relevant upfront, it's always an important backdrop, and the character's actions show subconscious devotion to their settings. An example of this is how Renton takes plenty of time discussing how he dislikes Scotland, but then narrates, \\"We go fir a [walk] in the auld Central Station, which is soon to be demolished... Somehow that makes us sad, even though ah wis eywis too young tae mind ay trains ever being here.\\" The atmosphere of Trainspotting is very honest with traces of pessimism. The world is portrayed darkly and depressingly, yet truthfully.<BR> The protagonist of Trainspotting, Mark Renton, has a very deviant view on life. The author shows Mark's thoughts, which for the most part are never appreciative or even attempt to see the bright side of things, unless the situation is ironic. He has a thick Scottish accent and dresses his lanky body in converse and fitted clothing. He has a reputation of being a screw up due to his constant state of kicking, relapsing, then starting back up on heroin. However, his mates do view him as trustworthy.  His actions may appear negative sometimes, but he also does have feelings of love and friendship he conveys to people. Irvine Welsh definitely wrote Mark to be a round character. He is also nowhere near a stock character because of his unique thoughts and actions. It's arguable whether he's a static or dynamic character, but I personally found Mark to be dynamic because of his thoughts at the end of the book compared with those at the beginning. By the time the resolution occurs, Mark's bitter hatred for the human race has begun to subside. Overall, I simply enjoyed Renton's rude, why-bother outlook on things.<BR> The narrative hook of Trainspotting occurs when an unknown character begins describing a group of people shooting up heroin as an everyday part of life. The plot is hard to determine since the book mainly switches to different characters and tells about random happenings in their lives. It goes in and out of the junkies' lives while they come off drugs, only to become defeated mentally and begin using again. The story also deals with the social interaction between the group of friends. Mark has built up angst for Sick Boy, who he must deal with. Begbie is constantly starting up unnecessary fights with innocent people, and Spud spends all his time dreaming about a relationship instead of getting up the courage to get one. As the chapters unfold and you discover who the characters really are it all builds up to the final climax of the story, one very shocking if not unbelievable one indeed.<BR> Irvine Welsh, while perhaps being a bit too crude for some people, is an amazing, extremely talented author. He writes in phonetics, combining dialogue, description, and a reader's own personal look into the character's minds. He includes flashbacks, lots of irony, symbolism, and even has song lyrics pertaining to scenes in the story included throughout the book. Once you get used to his style of writing, his humor in the dialogue and thought are extremely enjoyable. He has a very distinct style (at least to me because I haven't read any other work by British authors) and he tells the truth. By truth I mean he does not spare any detail that would occur in real life simply to make the story more polite. He's true to life and I enjoy reading what a character is actually thinking, or seeing how they really would react. Overall I think Irvine Welsh has a very enjoyable style of writing with his true-to-life scenes, somewhat darker humor, and interesting characters which make his work distinctive. If Irvine Welsh did indeed have just one theme for Trainspotting it would probably be to question things you wouldn't ordinarily, and to make up your own opinions. He wants to encourage the readers to gain their own sense of independence.  Irvine Welsh wrote the book to show ordinary life through the lives of unordinary people. I would highly recommend Trainspotting for anyone who is not too easily offended, enjoys real life stories, and is looking for a new and rare perspective on things.
B000001OAA|5.0|Do you remember the day you heard your favorite band for the first time? I do.<br />I had been helping a relative move my senior year of high school. As I was leaving for home he asked me if I liked Garbage. Ha ha, right?<br />Sure, doesn't everyone? I mused sarcastically, thinking he was trying to be funny...trying but failing miserably.<br />He said, No no the band.<br />Never heard of them, I said. But I was thinking that a band that called themselves Garbage had to be garbage. At that point I really wanted to go home.<br />Well, he gave me the CD explaining it wasn't his kind of music (sissified country was) and the second thing to earn an internal \\"WTF?\\" was the pink feather cover art. I mean, pink?? Pink was a BIG no no. No girl I knew would be caught dead in pink, with pink or looking at something pink. It was the nineties okay. We all wore flannels and holey jeans. Was this going to be a Mariah Carey wannabe so some other pop diva knock off? I was more a Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice n Chains kinda girl. Besides that, rock belonged exclusively to male artists. I never heard a female lead singer that I could actually tolerate listening to...until I heard Garbage for the first time. I have never looked back.<br />Despite everything that told me I should drop the CD in the \\"garbage\\" on my way to my car, I gave the band a chance just so I could say I listened to it...and fell in love almost instantly. We're not talking puppy love here, okay? I have not heard their equal in 15 years. They have ruined me for all other bands. The music is complex and whole. There are so many layers of instruments and harmonies and melodies and other fantastic sounds in every song!!?? And they are dark, oh so dark and sexy! Perfect mood music. The dissonance is freaking incredible. Who else does that!!?? Tell Me!!?? It seems to me enormous effort went into every track to make each of them amazing all by themselves. Not saying that Garbage should be every one's favorite, but they are mine because the music speaks to me in a very intimate and unexplainable way. If I had my own soundtrack following me around everyday...Garbage would be playing.<br />This album and the next (2.0) are very special to me (not so much their stuff after 2.0). I have so many nostalgic memories wrapped in them, good and bad. They have never gotten old.<br />I listen almost exclusively to alternative rock radio on the internet (107.9 out of Las Vegas) when I listen for new stuff. But I am not huge into music. The first two Garbage albums are the only albums I own where I enthusiastically enjoy every single track on them. Can't say that about any other band, although Muse comes in at a close 2nd.ks to me in a very intimate and unexplainable way.

B00005QDW5|5.0|This is a great album, I really didn't begin following this band until I purchased Meddle in Eight track tape. My Floyd fix continued with &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and I purchased most of the later albums.  Because I never was really able to get into their earlier material like relics and &quot;Adam Hearts Mother&quot; I personally think this album does an amazing job of fusing the bands early material with the albums like &quot;dark Side, &quot;Wish you were Here&quot; and &quot;animals&quot; which are the albums which gained this band a broader fan base.   I would recommend this album for any committed Floyd fan.  they really did a fantastic job of selecting some the best songs which were produced by Roger Waters and Co.  Its definately worth owning.

6305079811|5.0|This film is a visual wonder: a perfect recreation of the future, as people thought it was going to look, back in the 1930s.  The pastel colours of comic books printed on pulp dominate, with sets that make no attempt at realism.  Instead we get floating fortresses, crystal castles, rocket ships that look like plump V2s, except for the racey sports car fins.  And the clothes!  Collars are generally worn all the way up past the ears, while other characters sport shoulderpads as wide and dangerous as the scythes on Boudicca's chariot.  Gentlemen prefer tights.  (And at least some of these gentlemen prefer gentlemen.)<br />Director Hodges and his design team are absolutely right to set this in the imaginary future, the way it was supposed to be, rather than &quot;modernise&quot; Flash and his mythology.  And as the amazing &quot;retro-futuristic&quot; sets line up, like castles in the air, we can't help but be sorry that we didn't make their future turn out that way.  Boring modernism took over 20th century taste instead and knocked off all the curves, colours and rococo lines.  But this film's defiant aesthetic updates that style to bring us a future we should think about re-introducing.  Designer Danilo Donati obviously thinks that less is NOT more; it's a bore.  (He's right, of course.  It's a great relief in C21 finally to be dancing on modernism's grave - pomo's too; and good riddance, say I.)  <BR>    <BR>The script and acting are the purest camp, especially Sam Jones' performance as football hero Flash, a man who fell out of the Stupid Tree and hit every branch on the way down, as they used to say.  Jones' Flash is so cheerfully dimwitted you'd be excused for thinking he's been playing his footie without a helmet.  Except that football has clearly never even mussed up his hair, let alone his bone structure.  (And we kiwis and Aussies play our footie without helmets, and our footie players are wits, sages, raconteurs... No, come to think of it, they ARE a bit knocked off.)  <br />Milk-fed blonde Melody Anderson is Jones' IQ match as his girlfriend, the boring &quot;good girl&quot; Dale Arden.  Though a remarkably pretty woman, Anderson faces three obstacles to making much impact in this film.  First, Jones' performance is aimed with the widest and most obvious of winks at a gay audience, and so a girlfriend, though obligatory, is not to be allowed to get too close.  Second, Dale Arden has to speak lines like, &quot;Flash!  I love you!  But we have just 14 minutes left to save the world!&quot;  Which Anderson does as well as anyone reasonably can.  But third, she has the misfortune to be in the same film as (ahem!) the luscious (gulp) Ornella Muti.   <br />Ornella Muti's performance as the Bad Girl (yay!) Princess Aura's, on the other hand, is directed at gentlemen who prefer women (likewise women who prefer women; Muti makes it clear that her slippery young Princess Aura wouldn't mind all that much whether she bedded Flash or Dale)...  Another sign of her omnivorous tastes is the scene where her evil parents have her tied up and whipped (possibly a family that needs counselling) in order to make her reveal Flash's last known address.  Except that all she does is squirm around, clearly enjoying herself to the hilt.  Basically Muti's Princess Aura is sex on a cone, with syrup and macadamia.  Pauline Kael once said that Ornella Muti could make strong men groan, just by walking across a room.  Yup.  A-hrrr'mm.  Yup.  That'd be right.    <br />And Max von Sydow was - never mind his usual gloomy Swedish roles - born to play Ming the Merciless, all sinister amusement and gloating evil.  Von Sydow's Ming clearly only wants to enslave the universe for the sheer fun of it; he may be evil, but I can't help feeling Ming's Evil Empire would never be a dull place.  <br />And the splendidly silly soundtrack by Queen - &quot;Flash!  Wa-hahhh!&quot; - underlines the generally camp aesthetic.  And while I feel that a little bit of camp goes abloody long way (&quot;A little/More than a little is by much too much&quot;) this film is saved from the knowing tedium of, for example, the post-Burton Batman films by being relentlessly visually inventive, energetic, and leavening its silliness with cheerfulness.        <br />The DVD doesn't offer any extras, which is a pity because Michael Hodges is an interesting director (he also wrote and directed _Get Carter_ - the cool Michael Caine original, not the Sly Stallone remake), and I'd be interested to hear his thoughts on a commentary track.  But even without extras _Flash Gordon_ in DVD format is a great discovery, or re-discovery.  It's much under-rated: one of the best and most enjoyable sci-fi films of the 1980s, one that I enjoyed a lot more than _Return of the Jedi_, when that came out two years later.  Recommended.  <br />Cheers!<br />Laon
B00005Q3TZ|2.0|The action scenes are quite good but that doesn't make a film. The scipt is terrible. Probably the most stereotypical plot possible for a war film, a woman loosing a man to war. I've seen that many times. Pearl Harbor has 2 hours of pathetic unoriginal footage. The only parts i cant complain much about are the action sequences because well, they came close to depicting war. However I thought Disney's desicion to not allow the film to be rated R was rediculous. It didn't make it seem as terrible as it was. Almost a lack of respect towards those who were at pearl harbor. <br />If they weren't about to change the script so that the actual story [not the events of pearl harbor] were something new, the least stupid braukheimer could have done was shorten the thing to torture movie goers a little less. Thanks a lot...jerk....I can only hope he doesn't ruin BlackHawk Down, ridley scott beauty, the same way.
B00003CXTG|2.0|I don't get it. There's no bigger turn off than a DVD movie that has been split onto 2 DVDs. What's the excuse?? Give me one good reason why you can't fit the whole movie on one Digital Versatile Disc. Better image quality you say? That's total BS. DVDs were made for an immense storage capacity. You could fit three perfect versions of Pearl Harbor on one disc without losing .01% of video or audio quality. So what the hell is their excuse? It's just the same as the Godfather Part II in the box set. Why the hell 2 discs? What a joke. I repeat, &quot;WHAT A JOKE.&quot;
B00005RDAE|5.0|I think this video is the best video britney spears has ever had its cool it shows 4 music videos but the the name of it kind of makes you think that its all of her videos that she made. But I still like the video!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002J29|5.0|This double live album is as essential as any of Genesis' great LP's.  Notwithstanding the two boxed sets, Seconds Out is still the most important live document in existence for this band.  The only song on here that might be superseded by the boxed sets is Supper's Ready, but the version on here is damn good too.  <br />At this point (1977, Wind &amp; Wuthering tour), most people might not have heard of Genesis, but they were playing to huge crowds (very different from the intimate, raw &quot;Genesis Live&quot; from '73, also highly recommended, has Gabriel on it).  To me, the arena-rock atmosphere takes a little bit away from the feel, but also adds to it.  I own no live album that makes you feel like you're actually AT the concert when you close your eyes like this one does.  <br />The double album opens with Squonk, workman-like, but electric.  Chester Thompson is trying his best (his first tour as drummer), and mostly does a great job given the circumstances of having to learn the already monstrous Genesis catalog.  Carpet Crawlers is superb, eons better than the studio version.  Steve's guitar wails with his usual haunting intensity, although supposedly his guitar was shuffled down in the mix after he left (showing that even intelligent progressive rockers can be childish idiots to each other).  Robbery, Assault, etc. is pleasant enough, but is the week point of the set, notwithstanding Phil's quirky keyboard solo.  Afterglow is absolutely breathtaking, reason enough to buy these discs.  Then, things perhaps get even better with the best damn version of Firth of Fifth I've ever heard.  Though Tony uses Synth rather than piano and flute, it's still awesome.  Oh, and don't worry, Steve can at least still be well heard on this song.  There's a great version of I Know What I Like, with elongated jam session after &quot;You can tell me by the way I walk&quot; with snippets of Danicing with the Moonlit Knight and Stagnation.  Lamb/Musical Box is also quite good, andends the set (can someone e-mail me and tell me what Phil is saying before the Lamb?).<br />As good as the first disc is, the second is even better.  Supper's Ready is amazing, much better than the studio version.  Appocolypse in 9/8 is even a little scary.  Phil goes a little crazy in Willow Farm, but that fits the song.  (It's interesting to compare Phl's vocal interpretation with Gabriel's, the're both great).  I still think the piece ends too abruptly after the last part, as it always does, but hey, what can you do.  Cinema Show is the high point for me.  TONS better than the Selling England version.  During part 1, Phil and the 12 stringers do quite well with the soft parts, and Steve gets to jam a little.  Then comes part two, where Tony Banks shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is one fantastic keyboardist.  As a footnote, this track features Bill Bruford on drums (Yes, King Crimson), as it's the only track from the '76 tour included.  Bill &amp; Phil are very good together.  Then, at last, there is the showstopper extaordinaire, Dance on a Volcano/Los Endos, a great way to end the album (slightly annoyingly, the tracking is wrong on the remaster...Dance should end at 5:08).  <br />Of course, less than a year after Seconds Out, Follow You Follow Me came out.  It was all downhill from there :)
B00005RHGK|2.0|Actually, make that 1 and half stars.<BR>Two of my friends one day asked me - &quot;Why don't you watch many modern horror movies?&quot;  I explained to them that I usually found them boring, predictable and a waste of time, but I was reluctantly persuaded to see it after my friends claimed that it was supposed to be 'The greatest horror movie of the last ten years'.  ( Whoever made that claim seriously needs their head checked ).<BR>It starts off very well, but after the scene in which we see the man put two bodies down a large pipe, it goes drastically downhill.  The main pitfall of this movie, as in most horror movies, is that there are also too many unrealistic moments - namely who would be stupid enough to climb down the large pipe?<BR>The story seems to get more and more ridiculous as the film goes on, and by the end of it I had really lost my patience.<BR>If this is the best horror movie of the last ten years, then God help us.
B000002P5R|5.0|Many think that this album is just another reissue by Jimi's family, but it is actually what Jimi wanted.  It was intended to be a double (vinyl) album, but he had some trouble getting it released, due to the record company.  It was never finished, because Jimi died before it could be completed.  It would have been his best if it was finished, but it is still high in on my rating scale.
B000050X31|5.0|I thought this production was just delightful!  The Met stage and the set design give just the right amount of fun and imagination necessary for &quot;The Magic Flute.&quot;  Hamm is fantastic, just comically and vocally perfect.  Battle is just enchanting.  She is the PERECT Pamina.  Serra is just amazing.  She hits that F like she's got notes to spare above that; and her acting is commendable as well.  This absolutely gives the BEST represenation of what &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; should look like.  Good performances all around.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I won't be reviewing the movie much except to say that I enjoyed it tremendously. The music, the choreography and the sets were wonderful. <br />I will just say a few things about the DVD edition. For one thing, it is given in it's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 and not cut to 1.85:1 as stated in Amazon's website. It is an anamorphic transfer (enhanced for 16x9 widescreen TVs), although there is no mention of this on the box cover, or anywhere inside for that matter. <br />The casing unfortunately is a flimsy cardboard affair which cracked at the edges when I opened it.<br />The print used for the transfer is practically flawless and the picture quality is generally quite good. There is however quite a bit of edge enhancement seen in various scenes, especially the darker ones.<br />The sound is sumptuous and comes in both 5.1 Dolby Surround and 5.1 DTS.<br />The DVD had a tendency to default to displaying the subtitles when played on my RealMagic Hollywood Plus player but this wasn't a problem on other DVD players.<br />The extras make up the second of this 2 disc set and they alone are worth the price of the DVD. Unfortunately none of the material here has been enhanced for 16x9 TVs. There's a half hour documentary on the making of Moulin Rouge. There are separate interviews with all the main stars. There are full rehearsal sequences for all the major dance numbers. There are also sequences in the choregraphy section, of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman rehearsing their dance routines and clowning around. There are extended sequences for all the major dance numbers and there are multiple camera angle shots for all these numbers. This allows you to view the dances from whatever position you like. Fascinating. Unfortunately the camera angle thingie works in a small window and not full screen. <br />The deleted scenes segment contains alternate sequences for several scenes. The &quot;Come What May&quot; sequence includes scenes of the lovers rowing on a lake and of the them in a hot air balloon a la &quot;Around the World In Eighty Days&quot;. The &quot;Dance Across The Sky&quot; sequence is longer with heavier use of animation. There is also an extended Can Can Sequence and an alternate Green Fairy Sequence.<br />There is also a mini documentary showing Kylie Minogue rehearsing for her role as the Green Fairy. This is tucked away under the &quot;Design&quot; section in a sub-section under that titled &quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot;.<br />There are numerous other short documentaries on the special effects, costumes, artwork etc used to create the show and tonnes of photographs.<br />The music videos section includes a glorious full screen version of the Lady Marmalade music video which has razor sharp images compared to some of the other material here. There is also a live performance of Lady Marmalade taken from the MTV Awards which looks soft and almost blurry by comparison. After that there is a letterbox version of the &quot;Come What May&quot; video, the one featuring the insistent underlying thumping rhythm. For those who don't like this version, you can go to the Japanese Movie Trailer (it's in english) which features &quot;Come What May&quot; with a standard orchestral accompaniment.<br />This DVD release is fully packed and aside from the edge enhancement problem would be fully worthy of five stars.
B00005LQ04|4.0|I saw Deep Red when I was 13 and it had such an effect on me that I have never forgotten it.  The cleverness of the murders and the tense build of the story was phenomenal.  So when I bought Suspiria I had high expectations.  I wasn't disappointed.  It has the most  amazing choreographed murder scenes, they are horrifying! The woman caught in the room of sharp twisted wire is enough to send you running out of the room.   It is mostly in English but also has Italian sub-titled.  The fact that Dark Shadows own Joan Bennett is one of the stars ups the campy factor and adds some great humor, even if it is unintended.  The extra discs are okay.  But the movie is definitely a classic.
B00003CXBK|5.0|UNFORGETTABLE and POWERFUL<BR>Wow ! We watched the DVD yesterday and are still speechless... What a beauty ! The story is unforgettable and the poetry out of this world. I LOVED it ! The battle scenes are far from traumatic, compared to some unhealthy Disney violence (in Anastasia for instance) to the point that I am considering having my 10 year old watch the movie because of its powerful and poetic interest.
0792844890|5.0|Possibly, no definietly THE funniest movie in the World, I think every family would enjoy sitting togeather and watching this movie.  It has plenty of laughs and what I think to be the  best, funniest, and comical family movie in the World.  Also if you have not seen, or worse yet not heard of this movie you need to buy it from amazon.com.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|No solo es una excelente obra para los aficionados del septimo arte, sino que es una delicia a los oidos. Cada melodia nos recuerda momentos inolvidables de peliculas que, a la par, se encuentran inmersos en el corazon y mente de nosotros.<BR>John Williams es uno de esos genios musicales que nacen, viven, y terminaran siendo compositores que brindan placer al escucharlos.
B00003CX5P|5.0|After being slightly disappointed at the theater with the movie, I still purchased the DVD. (I fell in love with the first three films growing up.) After watching it a few times, I feel this movie gets better and better. The nuances of the cinematography and characterizations are far more advanced than the first series but done gently. Whereas Star Wars was more shoot- em- up, this is better at portraying a story. ( enough siskel and ebert)<BR>The DVD is an excellent combination of gimmicks and the movie. It is getting me excited for the arrival of the sequel or prequel, depending your point of view.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|after i got on video, my freind told me it was coming out on DVD and i was upset. aside from that, this DVD is awsome. in the begining of the dvd, they show a brief documetry of AIC (pre-columbia years). the documentry is about 10 min. then they show an un-released video for We Die Young, which was performed live(i think). then they show the original videos from We Die Youn to Get Born Again. whats also amazing, is that between every two videos they show some funny behind the scenes shot by the band while touring. the video for Sea Of Sorrow on this DVD is totally diffirent than the one in Live FACELIFT. i'm a little dissaponited with Sea Of Sorrow, because they edited (...)out of that video(especially Jerry's solo). my favorite videos are Man In The Box, Angry Chair, and Again. all the videos are pretty dark artistic. I think in an interview, Layne said he doesn't like making videos. and he also said they are great because all the videos show you what AIC see. I REALLY recommend this DVD.<br />PS: check out Sean Kinney's humor.
6305922756|5.0|Any Tap-heads out there need no introduction to this bona fide classic.  Simply buy the Special Edition DVD today and cherish it for life.   Tons of extra goodies make it the definitive home video version.  I'd also strongly recommend a killer new VHS release called &quot;Welcome to the Rainbow&quot;.  It's a hilarious rockumentary featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy of Motorhead, Ron Jeremy and other rock 'n roll lifers.  Almost as funny as Tap -- and it's all true!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|What can I say? I'm impressed. Unlike so many other computer generated movies, Shrek had more than just eye candy. There was actually a coherent, engaging, and comedic tale to go along with them. And what I like best is that it pleases everyone! The characters are easy to get to know, the plot is simple enough for kids to understand, but not so childish that parents won't enjoy watching it too, with many a play on words that the younger set will understand one way, and that the adults will understand another-really quite funny. There's even a moral or two at the end for the littluns. <BR>This is a great family movie. With three sarcastic characters, a laughable antagonist, and a hilarious plot with a twist you won't see coming, Shrek has got the goods to please anyone between the ages of seven to seventy! Enjoy!
B00005214X|5.0|First off, this should be an easy guess 5-Star review, right? After all the orginal late '72 release is a no-brainer 5-Star legend. Therefore, this expanded Deluxe release has to be all that, and then some...Right?<br />Sorry to say there's not much more here, other then the Ted Turner like &quot;colorized&quot; photos of the orginal B&amp;W cover art. With the several All Things Must Pass outakes, that have been floating around for years on bootlegs. Much has been made that those songs could have comprised a full vinyl LP worth of material, in place of the Eric Clapton, (Is God) guitar jams on the third LP. Keep It All! Thats what I say. Give us all the GEORGE you've got from those gorgous, spiritual, magical, unforgettable sessions. So, I remain committed to giving this release 5 Stars no matter what. I just could never give ATMP anything less. <br />It's cliched I know, but this album really, really conjures up where I was and how I felt and who I was with and ....you know what I mean. For me ATMP is not only George's finest hour, but I dare say will always remain the very best solo Beatle record ever.
B00005RYQO|4.0|Although I'm not a fan of imports( I prefer American muscle), this movie was pretty awesome.  When I left the theater, I RACED out of the parking lot, this movie makes you want to speed.  Jordana Brewster and the 69 Charger were the highlights of the movie.  Can't wait to own it.
078322687X|5.0|This movie is a classic and it will stand the test of time. This is the second &quot;teen coming of age&quot; installment from John Hues, and round 2 for Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. The first installment, Sixteen Candles, was more of a sexual coming of age movie whereas The Breakfast Club is more of a coming of age for one's character and social awareness. Where they are &quot;teetering&quot; with; staying with their social allegiances to their perspective pack, or do they listen to that inner voice...the voice of reason, maturity and human compassion that's not bound to any &quot;click&quot;. I like the choice of actors; I think they all fit like pieces in a puzzle and make their characters totally believable. I am in the same age range as almost the entire cast and I was a senior in High school when this film came out. Allot of reviews seem to put this film within the Junior High crowd but I feel it's much more mature than that. The very message that it's trying to get across isn't understood in real life until we get close to 18 or so. The story is simple; 5 kids have to come into school on a Saturday for detention. At first they try to segregate themselves according to their school social standings. Inevitably they find out that they are more alike than they ever thought. The movie, in my eyes, is broken into 3 parts; the first part is pure character development. This is where you (the viewer) gets to know each person they way they are supposed to be seen with their everyday face. At first, they act the way they think they should act, and stand up for what they always had, with out question or defiance. They stay true to their cause never steering away for a second. The second part of the film is where the movie itself develops. These 5 separate entities realize that they are variations of the same person. They have the same desires and anguishes. Their pressures and stresses are the same even though it's generated from very different sources.<br />The jock (Emilio Estevez) has the pressure to be on top of his sport (wrestling). In return for this he gets attention from his dad, coaches and keeps his standing within his social group. This is his priority in life and he doesn't stray.<br />The Princess (Molly Ringwald) has to conform and obey the rules of her social group in order to be accepted and keep her standing within the group. She keeps her eyes closed; mouth shut and goes along for the ride.<br />The Metal Head/criminal (Judd Nelson) is an angry guy! He wears the physical and mental scars of growing up in an abusive house. He hates most people, like the ones Emilio and Molly play, because in his eyes, they have had a free ticket and earned nothing...things are handed to them because of their social and/or economical standings. On the other hand, he feels that he's on a whole other plain because his eyes have been beaten open and he was forced to grow up a little faster than he wanted too or was ready too. I feel that Judd Nelson's character is the most crucial to the movie. He is the key to this whole new self-awareness for everyone, including himself.<br />The nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) is the quintessential geek. His every woken moment is spent learning. He hides behind his grades and in fact, he wants to be more accepted by the &quot;cooler&quot; groups. He also is a little &quot;cocky&quot; about his better grades and academically superiority to the other people in the room.<br />The weirdo (Ally Sheedy) is a loner and an outcast. She doesn't have friends that we (the viewers) know of. Because her parents ignore her, She feels ugly and without a place in the world. She is starving for positive attention. I think her character was needed in this movie to balance off the cast. It would have left out a very critical part of teen angst!<br />Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) is the &quot;Villain&quot; of the movie. To the kids, he represents the out of touch older generation and the mean spirited, high testosterone adult. For Richard Vernon, these kids are the source of his anger and agony. He has lost touch with the younger generation for 1 reason, he got older...and the older you get, the harder it is to relate to youth. Youth recycles right before your eyes, but you keep getting older. His character is the key that releases these kids. He helps them to strip away the blindfolds and to take a fresh look at every thing and everyone (including themselves).<br />This leads to the 3rd and final part of the movie. Where they cleanse themselves of all the pentad up anger and prejudices, where they experience a sort of rebirth. When the kids realize that they all have the same goal, they were just taking different roads to reach it. I also like the fact that Anthony Michael Hall's character, the nerd, has the last word and Judd Nelson's character, the criminal, gets the last scene. I think it was poignant that the 2 groups that are pushed the furthest down the social ladder get to close out the movie and punctuate the message that is being given' to a person that represents the source of their anguish. I highly recommend The Breakfast Club and it should go down as one of the all time great teenage movie!adult. For Richard Vernon, these kids are the source of his anger and agony.

B00005R23S|5.0|DISCLAIMER: although the title makes it sound a little like i am one of those braindead bravo-crying fans who applaud even when their greatest idol takes a dump, I am not. This dvd just earns to be called the Boss, because it is a superior work of technology concerning sound, performance, editing, mixing, and bona-fide filming.<br />The songs contained on this disc are all great - a lot of hits, but, unfortunately not many classics (except maybe jungleland). of course i bought this dvd, because i wanted to have a visual recording of the msg concerts and of these songs, because i like them. the problem just is that there are too many songs missing ...still. in that aspect, the cd too was a disappointment, the dvd - let me tell you - is much much better. but still, i'd like to hear the full version of back in your arms and not just a sampler during the 10 min featurette. where are the new songs? and i defintely don't mean american skin or land of hope and dreams. <br />these studios releasing the boss stuff don't want to give us much. why can't the release a film version of an entire concert and not just songs from two different ones where they leave out some of the essentials. this hurts me, ...because i have not attended one of springsteen's concerts of the world tour. for real fans this might just be a tiny piece of beef you throw in front of the nose of a hungry dog. <br />believe me, what you get on this dvd is great...
0385501560|5.0|From a writing perspective, CHOKE is another spin on the writing style of FIGHT CLUB. It's got a lot of the same narrative tricks and polish, including stressed non-linearity, catchphrases, &quot;insider info&quot;, and of course, a decent twist ending.<br />But if you loved FIGHT CLUB, you will equally love CHOKE. If you're just dabbling, you'll still appreciate the story for being visceral, different than the rest of the work on the market, and definitely thought provoking.<br />Choke has a pace that makes your typical MTV video seem lame and boring. It's an explosive razor sandwich of flavours, and guaranteed to make your eyebrows raise at least once every few minutes.<br />Palahniuk delivers.

0618002227|1.0|The best review I ever read of this book was by one of Tolkien's own circle of friends. After hearing Tolkien read aloud yet another chapter of the Ring trilogy, the visitor exclaimed &quot;Not another goddam elf!!??&quot;. Tolkien's work is so dense and slow moving you wonder if it is an adventure or a still photograph. He has no concept of moving the narrative ahead. His dialogue is wooden. The Hobbits sound like robots. His poetry is leaden. What is the point of this book? I can't figure out why people praise it so! And why is it that whenever anyone does a take on a mythically powerful ring, they need such absurdly great lengths to do it (hello Richard Wagner). I am utterly puzzled by the enthusiasm this book stirs up in people. To me, it is a mindless, poorly written, utter bore.

The songs have meaning and substance (although some take longer for you to figure out just what that meaning and substance IS), the band plays extremely well, and above all else, it's just really, really good to crank up way louder than need be.<BR>I happen to prefer the faster variety of metal, and that's also something that Master of Puppets delivers in quantity.
0385505833|5.0|Before telling you my opinon of the book I would like to remind readers of the phrase, &quot;Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.&quot; So I believe that although having the Peace Corps located in a spot where it existed in reality may have improved the story for those people who really seem to get stuck on small details, it doesn't degrade the book in any way. I still find it funny and entertaning, although I believe that it isn't among the best of Grisham's novels. If you were to compare it to the novels written by many other authors in the same genre you would find that it is really a wonderful story!

B000002OVJ|5.0|One of the 3 greatest live Rock LPs ever recorded (along with the Stones GET YER YA-YA'S OUT and Bob Marley's LIVE), LIVE AT LEEDS is extended but not quite improved by the addition of several tracks and some resequencing.<br />Still, it is the greatest quitar workout you're ever going to hear.  Townshend is lyrical, powerful, rockin', and even a bit soulful--all within the same tune.  His guitar work flies in every direction without ever seeming out of control.  &quot;My Generation&quot; is far different from the 2 minute 30 power version; here it incorporates much of Townshends riff-output from '68-'70.<br />You gotta have it.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I'm not here to give a summary of Labyrinth, but instead I simply wanted to push those of you on the fence off... If you aren't sure whether you want this movie let me give you the answer... YES YOU DO!!!!!<br />When Labyrinth first came out in the movie theater I was a young teenager and I was immediately captivated.  This movie spoke to me like no other movie ever had.  It was that awkward time in every kids life, not quite a child not quite an adult.  Like all good Fairy Tales, this one aided me in realizing despite wanting to hold on to my childhood I had to let go, but that it didn't mean forgetting or leaving who I was behind.  I've taken my childhood with me ever since.  All of these complex ideas were intangible to me as a child but now when I watch Labyrinth I'm reminded of who I was and who I am.<br />Also the DVD version includes a wonderful behind the scenes making featurette.  Listening to Jim Henson describe what we was trying to accomplish (especially in the ballroom scene) is simply enthralling... Jim Henson was a master storyteller and Labyrinth is quite possibly his finest creation.
0385505833|5.0|Most of today's holidays have become cliched and most of us have forgotten what Christmas is supposed to represent.  Instead, we get lost in the mass hysterics of shopping, decorating, cooking, and partying rather than realizing what this holiday really is - a time we can spread peace and love to all.<br />Grisham captures the reality of this madness and while the Kranks do eventually come to realize the true spirit of Christmas, they fall back into the &quot;routine&quot; with renewed vigor, yet knowing that sometimes Christmas, in spite of the competition and madness, is spending time with those that you love.  Good job!!
B00003CXTG|2.0|this film fails in so many areas that I lost count.One-My girlfriend wanted to leave the room before the actual attack took place.The love story,which is 90% of the movie were putting me to sleep.It seems to me that they tried to pull off a titanic,it didn't work.<br />Although during the attack which i felt was a perfect length I loved the shots,they were in fact beautiful.But don't forget &quot;tora tora tora&quot; did nearly the same thing with no digital effects. and actually it stole lines of dialogue word for word from that film.And Alec Baldwin taking credit for the Kamikazi....that's a Japenese thing sorry..American Pride needs to be pulled back just a bit i think.<br />I'm not the only one who didn't want a lame charactered love story.<br />Effects were excellent,but effects aren't everything.Sound in DTS 5.1 is great...Have not listned to the dolby 5.1 track yet.<br />Worth buying only if you intend to use the attack scenes as a demo for system proformance.<br />A.P.L
0451160916|5.0|My whole life I've endured friends talk about \\"redrum\\" or describe Jack Nicholson's eyebrows during the famous \\"Here's Johnny\\" monologue. But purely on principle, I never sat in front of the movie. I promised myself I would read the book first, so I could further appreciate a film everyone but I had seen.So after finishing King's nearly 700 pages during three nights in an ancient apartment in early December, I sauntered over to the video store.<br />Three hours later, I wondered what the big deal was.<br />While reading the book, I shuddered every time the phone rang in my bedroom or the heater awoke copper pipes in my building. After stretches of 200 pages or more, I held the book closed in my lap for 20 minutes before I could sleep, convincing myself that I was not Jack, that I was not Danny. In the book, the ghosts are spooky and the tension is startling. But what is most chilling, what kept me turning at 4 and 5 a.m., were images such as Jack's mother on the kitchen floor, wasps under burning leaves, a mangled bike tire in the rear-view mirror and the bitter taste lingering during an Excedrin buzz. <br />Save the two pale twins in the movie, I was unaffected. Bored.<br />I wondered why 217 was 237, why a gin martini was bourbon on the rocks, why Danny's broken arm was a dislocated shoulder. It was, at best, annoying. I suppose a lot is determined on what is experienced first: the movie or the novel. Still, I will forever remember reading The Shining. I have already forgotten Jack Nicholson.
B00003CY0V|3.0|Let's not critisize this movie for being stupid, predictable, and borderline boring.  Let's also not critisize my embarrassing inability to find a dictionary to check my spelling of the word \\"critisize\\".  This is a glossy action movie that you buy on DVD and skip straight to the explosion, car chase, and Halle Berry scenes.  Don't read those other reviews that rip this movie for it's unintelligent and mediocre script.  You already know this movie (....).  This is just a movie you put in when you want to impress your friends with your ground-shaking 500 watt home theatre system.  Based on that alone, I'll give it 3 stars.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|What an incredible edition of an incredible film. This DVD is a 3 disc set. Disc 1 is the Bootleg Cut, not called \\"Almost Famous\\" but called \\"Untitled\\". It has approx. 36 minutes of new footage (most of which should never have been cut), and new scenes include a hilarious radio interview with Stillwater featuring Kyle Gass of Tenacious D, many extended scenes which explain the few flaws and uncertainties of the film, , a kick-(...) commentary with Cameron Crowe and members of the Vinyl Films team, not to mention his on mother. Also, the are actual interviews with the REAL Lester Bangs, a behind-the-scenes documentary, Cameron Crowes Top 10 Albums of 1973 (narrated, of course) among many other features. Disc 2 is the Theatrical Release, and features extras like an entire Stillwater Concert, the ENTIRE screenplay (Which won an Academy Award), and the precious \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" deleted scene, in which William and his friends and mentors use the Led Zeppelin epic to convince her the positivity of rock music and let him go on tour with Stillwater. The scene was not included because they could not get the rights to the song, so the scene directs you to get your copy of \\"Stairway\\" and play it along with the scene as you watch it. Among the other features are a trailer, cast & crew bios, production notes, all of which were included on the first DVD. The third disc is an audio CD of all six Stillwater songs heard throughtout the movie, all in studio form, which are all excellent. This movie was the best movie I had ever seen before this release, and i couldn't imagine how better it could have gotten. How wrong was I? This is a must-have DVD, good for any collection. Everybody in this film gives a superb performance (Kate Hudson was robbed at The Oscars), and the film itself is a masterpiece. It gives an honest backstage view of the final glory days of rock, before rock changed to an \\"Industry of Cool\\". One of my favorite films and DVD's ever.

B00003CXZ1|4.0|Angelina looked great throughout!  <br />As for the plot - hmm - I can't seem to remember.  Perhaps I'll have to view it again - a pleasant thought, but I suspect I'll have nothing further to add to this review afterwards.  If given the choice of a flick to watch when being given a lobotomy, this would rate near the top of the list.
0345440757|1.0|As if things weren't stressful enough with a newborn in the house with all the expectations of the baby, the new mom and the family and friends hovering over....this book just makes things worse.  I only give it one star because it is edited and all the words are spelled correctly.  this book is a bust.  don't waste your money.

6303168507|5.0|Schindler's List gives viewers a sense of the distruction that Nazi Germany set out to do.  I love the knowledge, and facts that this movie is filled with, and the compassion that Oscar has towrds the Jews at the end of the movie.  I love the realism, the horror. Realism in this case being horrifing, but perfect. I found the scene when Amon was trying to shoot the hinge worker a litter fake when no bullets came out of the pistol when cocked, but over all this movie is excellent.  &quot;Everyone should be required to watch this movie.&quot;
0066620996|5.0|you want to have a seed of discontent planted inside yourself. This book can make you very uncomfortable with its revelations. However, if you can withstand the brutal challenge to what you may have thought constituted great management and leadership, then you too may be at that transition point to transform your organization and yourself from good to great. Collin's book may also bring you to the realization that being part of greatness is your aspiration and that you can't get there with your present organization. Then you have a checklist with which to evaluate prospective employers in your quest. Even if being part of a great group is not a driver for you, the points Collins makes allow you know how far off the group is.
B000002U82|5.0|Well, there probably isn't much I can say about this album that hasn't already been said; so I'll keep it short. This is a great album to sit back and chill to, where chill encompasses various activities some legal while others are not quite as. This is really an album that you want to just sit down and listen to the whole thing. The songs all flow into each other and once you start it's hard to stop. (...) Also the length of this album is just right to accomodate listening to the whole thing. It's about 45 minutes, which might seem a little short but if you just have time to sit around and listen to music all day, you can put it on repeat. In conclusion, just know that if you want something that you can really relax to, or trip out to, depending what kind of mood you're in, this is the album for you. I think that it is an excellent album for any mood that I'm in and I'm sure it will be the same for most anybody out there.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I was one of those that heard the bad reviews of this film and decided if I was going to spend $20 bucks on a movie I would wait for the DVD to at least get something for my money.  <br />I just bought this DVD yesterday.  I watched it and I am kicking myself.  This movie is a great blend of romance,war, and friendships.  It is just enough to get you interested in the characters.  The major scenes are without a doubt the actual attack scenes which are real cool.  <br />I was upset by only one thing.  The english subtitles to the Japanese dialoge &quot;bit&quot;.  They were micro sized on the screen and you had to be right up on the TV to read them.  That was down right stupid. Why not just have them speaking in english for us folks...????<br />I still give the film a 5star rating cause I moved closer to the set and could make out a few of the last subtitles.  Hey you guys fix that for the 3 disc release will ya?<br />The all star cast is nice.  I liked the friends.  I thought it was well done making them buddies from the same hometown.  That is not uncommon.  It was a bit predictable about the resurrection of Affleck's character.  His character was a bit overblown fighting on 3 continents.  Also he seemed to have an ego as big as &quot;Maverick&quot; from TOP GUN.  Nice acting.  Bad character.<br />In short, don't allow yourself to stay away from the film.  It does have allot to offer.  If you are a WWII buff this is a must see.  I recommed.

0887307396|4.0|I found this book to be a disturbing reminder of why I cannot work in corporate business. Being &quot;bombarded&quot; with someone else's &quot;vision&quot; for a company goals, in a culture that &quot;weeds out&quot; those people who don't buy in, is not my idea of a quality way of life. The mentality represented here is one that I have witnessed. I tried to tell myself that I was just being negative, but apparently not.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace has got a real strong place in my heart.First of all I want to thank to Mr.Lucas to produce this movie.Before everything I want to mentione that the special effects are wonderful the music is as strong as the oldest parts besides the cast is so well selected every thing is graet in this movie however I can not stand my self to tell that I can not feel the Real Star Wars atmosphere in this episode I think that Dart Maul saves this movie.I strongly reccomend every body to own one. MAY THE FORCE BE WTH YOU .
B00000254Q|4.0|Amigos came on the heels of some of Santana's most adventurous work. But by 1976, the musical climate was no longer conducive to the exploratory jazz-rock of Welcome and Borboletta; the twin pressures of disco and arena rock loomed over Santana, and the band moved toward airplay and a more commercial sound.<br />Tom Coster, Carlos and producer David Rubinson probably looked at the eclecticism, catchy melodies and punchy rhythms of Abraxas when creating Amigos [...]. \\"Take Me With You\\" is a slicked-up \\"Incident at Neshabur\\" and the much-praised \\"Europa\\" is a more professional (but less moving) guitar ballad in the mold of \\"Samba Pa Ti\\". These guys knew how to mimic a good formula! Other highlights are the Latin folk of \\"Gitano\\", the catchy \\"Dance Sister Dance\\" (nice jam at the end), and the funky \\"Tell Me Are You Tired\\". \\"Let It Shine\\", the band's blatant attempt to cash in on the disco craze, is conveniently placed at the end of the album. Overall, this is a very good album that doesn't take many chances but will please most Santana fans.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|This has to be in the top 3 of my years best cds to come out.  Jb and KG have put out the greatest and best cd in the world.  This is one of the funniest cds i have ever heard.  They could have put some of the other songs that they have done in the past, but this was over sufficient.  Funny as hell in my opinion.  It was well worth the 12 dollars that i paid for it, and i would gladly pay that again for the cd.  Comedic Brilliance is achieved with this cd, espicially if you have never heard the D in action before.  This is a must buy!
0385484518|5.0|I loved everything about this little book.  I must say it was one of the best books I have ever read.  I found it so hard to put down, and once I finished it, I opened it up nad started all over.  Just reading this book has changed my persepective on life...caused my to slow down and enjoy life's little treasures.  I would reccomend this book to anyone and everyone!
6300215512|5.0|Born in the 70s and raised in the 80s, it's a constant struggle to fight against the tendency to view movies as just a source of visceral stimulation - as spectacles. It's a struggle to keep watching movies that don't have fantastic, juvenile Imitation Brand Plot Substitutes because growing up, that was all I knew. <br />Movies like Sunset Boulevard are going to help change that, and I wish that they were still part of popular culture. I saw this last night and it was astonishing. For anyone who might equate old or God forbid even black and white with &quot;boring,&quot; this movie is the cure. There's none of the easy titillation that's so easy to find today, but in a much more interesting and subtle way, Sunset Boulevard is very depraved and cynical. Even in the 50s, Hollywood was covering a culture of decay and depravity, of spiritual death, with the glossy veneer. Sunset Boulevard, on the strength of its sharp dialogue, expert direction, and dead-on performances, told a compelling story in an original way. It reminded me of Pulp Fiction, of all things, in the way you could feel that you were watching a director's vision unfold perfectly, like a meticulously planned 4 course meal.<br />Looking back on old movies it's hard to view them in context, as what was original and creative then has usually become co-opted and cliched by now. But this film manages to still feel new, and there were some truly sublime moments, like the shot of Norma Desmond's bedroom doors, with light shining through the ripped-out locks, like two empty eyes keeping watch over her boy toy - and then abruptly extinguish. <br />There's not much point getting into the plot, which is described in 50 other reviews here. Suffice to say, even the most sensory-deadened product of the &quot;blockbuster&quot; culture can enjoy Sunset Boulevard, even today - the writing, directing and acting are that rich and exciting. Why is this not out on DVD yet?!
B00005JKHP|4.0|I've never been a big fan of ST TMP.  I remember sitting in the theater when it was first released and thinking to myself, &quot;Come on, I have to like this movie.&quot;  Unfortuantely it didn't seem to get any better as I watched.  In fact, I have always thought it was too long and a bit dull.  Even the colors used for uniforms, sets, and lighting, added to the bland taste of the entire movie.  Certainly all the re-introductions of the ship and characters had to be done I suppose but it made for a very slow movie.  But here we have the new DVD Version!!! With newly added scenes and a reworked score, it's really a better movie now!  This is one example of how music can affect the momentum of a movie and its story.  The enhanced score gives the movie a much needed boost.  The new images of the V'ger ship at the end is a nice touch along with other added effects. Of course, the quality of DVD is light years ahead than any seen on video.  I took a second to play a little of my video copy and there is simply no comparison.  So I highly recommend this version.  It it is now very watchable and like me, I think you will be able to even tolerate those silly dull pajama-like uniforms.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|Tombraider has always been an inspiration for game players around the world, being Laura the center of attention, her cunning will, and spicy attitude is what made her famous, In the Tombraider movie the casting director did an excellent job when choosing Angelina joli her role of Laura was beyond words, however I can't say the same for the writers, I mean what where they thinking when they wrote the story? I mean did they even have writers to begin with? maybe the producers got cheap and thought they could write it themselves. it was terrible, they could have done so much with the movie.  I had been  waiting 3 years for this movie to come out, and now im sorry I did.
6305949980|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters back in 1993, and bought the dvd two years ago.  It has been viewed quite a few times, and I never tire of it.<br />&quot;Nightmare&quot; has great music, some haunting and some fun(&quot;What's this is my personal favorite), great animation, and I love the story.<br />Jack Skellington, the pumpkin King, is the main character.  At the end of Halloween he is all in a tither as to what to do next?  The next major holiday with a figure is Christmas.  Wwhile wondering in the woods, he discovers the gateways to other holidays.  He falls into &quot;Christmas Town&quot; and is in awe.<br />He comes up with the idea of stealing Christmas as he isn't in the mood to wait around for the next Halloween. After discovering Christmas, Jack spends half his time trying to figure it all out and understand it.<br />This film is a bit dark, and I certainly don't recommend it as a family film.  I say parents should watch it first, alone, then decide for themselves if they think their children will be okay with it.  There are some scary ghoulish images.<br />I personally think it's an adult movie, with it's dark humor and imagery.<br />Decide for yourself..it is worth it.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I purchased this album based upon the reviews I had read both here, and in some magazines.  This kid's got a lot of buzz, and with good reason.  This album may not be the best album out right now, and it is not ground-breaking in any way, but it is a good showcase of promise.  <BR>I have heard the comparisons to DMB, want to say that this is not a singer trying to be someone else - this is an honest artist, not an impostor.  I do not hear him trying to sing like someone else.  There is a whispered emotion in his voice that is a welcome sound, in comparison to the overbearing vocals of most alternative albums today.  <BR>I did buy this album without hearing even a single song off of it, and am very happy that I did.  The album varies between folk, alternative rock, and lite rock - the latter being the poor songs I addressed in the title.  <BR>John's strength lies in his honest songwriting.  He seems to have a knack for getting his feelings across effortlessly.  The best three songs on the album are easily Why Georgia, My Stupid Mouth, and Your Body is a Wonderland.  They stand out due to the wonderful songwriting (one of my favorite phrases on the album is &quot;bubble-gum tongue&quot; in Wonderland).  Love Song to No One also stands out for the same reason.  John's honest look at his feelings, and his excellent ability to relay them to the listener make the album what it is.  3X5 and Not Myself also stood out to me, although more so for the guitar and beats.  I am a single 25 year old man, and I think that has a lot to do with my strong feelings for this albums great songs.  I could relate to the situations that John writes about.  Someone older, and more settled, may not get the same feeling from the album.  I still think it would be worth the purchase, if for no other reason than to hear an emerging talent at his start.  <BR>I said &quot;at his start&quot; for a good reason.  This album does not sound finished.  It does not sound as though he had made up his mindas far as the type of album he wanted to make.  I have very eclectic tastes, but to mix in so much lite rock was a mistake in my opinion.  This is not an album where I can put it on and enjoy it all the way through.  No Such Thing reminds me of a song that would have been rejected off a Hall &amp; Oates record in the 80's.  Neon and 83 also have too much 80's lite rock in them for my taste.  The most puzzling song on the album is City Love.  It starts off so well, with some great blues guitar - then fades into some crazy symphony with strings and something that most lite rock stations would not even play.  The songwriting is still excellent here, and I hope he releases an acoustic version, or redoes it on a later album.  The songs that I did not metion by name do not stand out one way or the other.  They are good background music, but nothing worth noting.  <BR>This is a great debut album, and despite it's problems, I do believe that it is worth purchasing. <br />fyi - While I do not think that John is like DMB, he does remind me of an early Tim Mahoney.  If you like this album, you should check out Tim Mahoney's &quot;3 Different Views&quot; to see the kind of album that John is probably capable of making in a few years.
B00005LOUQ|3.0|\\"The Grinch\\" is portrayed by an extremely over the top acting of Jim Carrey.  It's like watching his character, Ace Ventura trying to be Grinch.  He really goes way over in this movie, which I think is why some people are cringing at it.  I think only true fans of Carrey and not the story the Grinch, will appreciate this film more.  It is an entire different entity.<br />The book and cartoon are classic Dr. Seuss and a staple at Christmas time, and the movie has been panned because of not keeping up with the original story.  Also, there is alot added, which had to be otherwise this movie would have been a half hour also.<br />I really thought that Taylor Monsen, Cindy Lou Who, was so adorable as Cindy Lou Who(who is alot more than two).  She helped to bring the story life.<br />Some of the additional things seem sort of silly, but whenever The Grinch is onscreen, it's pretty funny and entertaining.<br />(...) this is not meant to be taking so seriously, take the original story/cartoon for what it is, and the movie for what it is.<br />The scenery and make up are all amazing, and in the extras on the dvd, I learned that circus folk from Cirque De Soleil are in the movie.  It  all adds up to a fun time, JMO....<br />(...) It's Christmas, people, lighten up!<br />I think overall this is a great Christmas movie for the entire family.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|I visited the movie theater twice to see this movie while it was still out, and I bought the DVD right away when it came out. The plot is cute, the characters and performances were outstanding, and the visuals were very impressive. The only thing that keeps me from giving this movie 5 stars is that it's not something you can watch over and over again and never get tired of. For that, I recommend South Park, Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. =)
630179513X|3.0|Marty McFly is now stranded in 1955. After burning the book Biff used to tamper with time, Doc was struck by lightning and sent back 70 years, 1885. Marty learns this when he receives a letter from him that has been saved that many years. So the Doc of the past once again helps Marty with his problems by finding the DeLorean which has been sitting in a cave for several decades and fixes it up to run again. They look up information learning Doc is killed by Bufford, ancestor of Biff Tannon. So Marty knows he has to stop this by going back in time to the Wild West. Now things are really complicated this time when the car loses fuel and can not run which it must in order to take them back. But they find a solution to their problem by learning a train can push it up to the distance required to time travel. But first they have to prevent Doc's death by conflicting with Bufford Tannon. Not only that, Doc is distracted by a woman named Clara Clayton. All this makes it so difficult for Marty and Doc that they wonder if they will ever get back to the year, 1985- 100 years later.
B00003CY0V|4.0|Maybe I'm over-praising this movie because I wasn't really expecting much beyond an amiable time passer, but I really enjoyed &quot;Swordfish&quot;. I especially liked the way it didn't so much avoid the usual action thriller components, but instead did them in new and fresh ways. For example, the explosion outside the bank at the start of the film was probably the most interesting and artful explosion I ever saw in a movie. I also liked how the bad guy really was, well... bad, but, then again... he wasn't. Okay, maybe the complexity of the moral questions here didn't reach epic proportions, but there was at least some genuine complexity as we got to know the Travolta character and had to ask ourselves if his means justified his ends. So, in short, this is a thoughtful, entertaining thriller, that even manages to be a bit sexy. There are lots of terrific extras on the DVD, too, including a few alternate endings that further demonstrate that director Dominic Sena picked exactly the right conclusion for the movie. By the way, this movie will REALLY rock if you have a big screen TV and a good surround-sound system.

0790741164|5.0|Stone's masterpiece is a marvelous work of cinematic choreography and script-writing.  It is equally a profound contribution to media genres which strive to stimulate thought rather than repress it.<br />The film's importance does not simply end with the movie theaters and reviews.  And it is no less significant that even cable-TV channels seem bent on avoiding the film.  It had a deep impact on American government, provoking a landmark piece of legislation in the US Congress, passing as the 1992 JFK Records Collection Act.  The Act itself was unprecedented, mandating a unilateral review of classified government documents across the entire cabinet-agency landscape by independent academics appointed by the President.<br />Immediately after the preview of the film before both houses of Congress -- and before its release to the public -- critics scrambled to destroy the film, arguing that it was filled with misleading fiction about Dealey Plaza and that it shamefully revised history, placing a false understanding of historical fact in the minds of America's young.  Let's examine those criticisms carefully.<br />Stone used dramatic artifice to protect living witnesses of the events surrounding Dealey Plaza, and to chronologically relocate factual correspondence and exchanges between the two star consultants to his film-making -- Jim Garrison (d. 1991) and Col. L. Fletcher Prouty (d. June 5, 2001).  He replaced Perry Russo --  Garrison's keystone witness in the 1968 Clay Shaw trial -- with a fictional homosexual prostitute in Angola Prison, portrayed by Kevin Bacon in the film.  Russo got a bit part in the barroom scene at the beginning of the film.  The correspondence between Garrison and Prouty occurred between the late 1970s and the early 1990s, so Stone moved it into the context of the Clay Shaw trial with the fictional meeting of Garrison and &quot;Mr. X&quot; near the Lincoln Memorial on the Capital Mall.  <br />Except with some minor liberties taken with the film's reporting about the death of Eladio del Valle, it dramatically presents the Shaw trial in a reasonably accurate evidentiary context.  The film draws much material from Garrison's own book -- &quot;On the Trail of Assassins&quot; (1987).  <br />Viewers who wish to expand their understanding of the facts and suspicions presented in the film will do well to pause the second VHS tape during the black-and-white flashback recalled by Mr. X of the phone conversation presented from the perspective of &quot;General Y's&quot; office, so that they can read the US government nameplate behind the vase on the General's bookcase.  With the passage of the Records Act, several witnesses and investigators came forward to publish their memoirs, absolved of their non-disclosure agreements with the government.  Viewers who want to examine the publications precipitated by the film can begin with Mr. X and read Prouty's memoir -- &quot;JFK:   The CIA, Vietnam and the Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy&quot; (2nd ed. 1996).  <br />Some viewers and many dabblers in the forthcoming literature of the assassination are glib in their recommendation of Gerald Posner's &quot;Case Closed&quot; -- a work that is suspect just in its timeliness, and which can be torn apart with new evidence and facts.  I argue that Stone, despite his many detractors and criticisms of the &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; film satire, is a film-maker committed to the Truth.  That &quot;JFK&quot; merely presented pointers on the assassination-research compass to a general audience was sufficient to Stone's apparent purpose.  Its instrumental role in catalyzing the Records Act is irrefutable history.  To say he took some liberties with his material is equivalent to saying that Shakespeare adapted the history of Julius Caesar and took advantage of the Elizabethan stage as a money-grubbing opportunist.<br />The difficulty with the history of Dealey Plaza is the political layer of reality which surrounds it.  When the trail-signs enter the exchange of political dialogue about the Dealey Plaza history, certain partisan &quot;believers&quot; either tend to run away or throw stones -- no pun intended.  Stone avoids noting those consistent trail-markers that bear a particular partisan stamp -- preferring instead to examine the overall landscape of special interests surrounding the government agencies central to the film's plot.  He looks beneath the political icing to reveal the actual cake itself.  As the historians of American film-making add to the public's appreciation of the genre in the Future, Stone will be remembered every bit as well as Orson Welles for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.  In fact, both directors bore deep scars on their careers that were consequential to the release of their respective masterpieces.
0385505833|1.0|Okay, so I have never read a Grisham book before this. And I assure you, I will not be reading another one. I understand that this is different from the type of things he usually writes. But I can't imagine how anything could be any better. Predictable comes to mind. Dull, another. Not too mention, what kind of writing style is that? It reads like a bad timeline. This happened, then this.<br />The tale of a family whose daughter is away. So, they decide no Christmas this year. Their neighbors get made and try everything to change their minds. I understand this will be a movie. I can see that, but take my advice and wait for that. The book just isn't worth it.
0446310786|5.0|I laughed and cried on first reading Lee`s mastre piece .This is the book I would refer to when asked to name the best book I have ever read.
0767817664|5.0|What would you do if a vampire moved in next door?  That's the question this movies asks as young Charlie Brewster gains a most unwelcome neighbor at the beginning of the movie.  Charlie isn't the smartest guy in the world but he does figure out that a vampire has moved next door and immediately tries his best to tell others about him... a strategy that is obviously doomed to failure since no one will believe a hysterical teen yelling that a vampire next door is killing people.  Without giving away any more of the plot, most of the rest of the movie involves Charlie and his friends trying to survive long enough to kill their new nemesis.    One of the great things about this movie is that it isn't trying to add some weird twist to the idea of vampire movies.  It isn't a comedy ([[ASIN:B00094ARKU Love at First Bite]]), a grand drama ([[ASIN:B00004RFFS Interview with the Vampire]]), an action movie ([[ASIN:6305258287 Vampires]]), etc.  It's a suspenseful vampire movie.  Period.  That sounds like such a simple idea, yet I've rarely seen any other vampire film actually pull it off like this one.  We meet a small group of fairly interesting people, they're put in danger, and we spend the rest of the film on the edge of our seats hoping they get out alive.     Finally, this movie is worth watching just to see Roddy McDowall's performance.  The entire cast does a great job, but McDowall really stands out as he plays a washed up actor.  A small and frightened man, he is forced to confront extreme terrors or die.  McDowall is so expressive and believable that the movie gains a depth that another actor might well have failed to deliver.    If you're a vampire fan tired of seeing bad film after bad film then cheer up, this one will make your day for sure!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|Good idea.  God-awful mastering.  Every song was NoNosied to death.  In a misguided attempt to remove the tape hiss, the music was destroyed.  It even sounds bad on a boom box, much less a decent stereo system.  This music could be mastered well, but the guys at Abbey Road are to in love with new gee whiz technology to do it right.  Everything the Beatles did was recorded using Electron Tube equipment, and should be remastered with the same kind of equipment.  The only way for you to hear the music on CD as it was meant to sound is to hunt down a mint copy of one of their original LPs and burn your own CD or buy a Bootleg sourced from the original vinyl.
B000053V7Q|5.0|I can't wait for all of the concert films to be on DVD.  This is a GREAT DVD!  Yes it is similar to the original movie (with the exception of the missing songs that the money hungry royalty owners would not allow use of) but it is still GREAT!  Any time that you get to see Elvis laid back, is worth the money for the product, be it a video, book, or audio selection.  Elvis is in his glory during this film and the re-editing was perfect.  I own both the video and DVD versions of this film and I highly recommend the DVD version because you don't waste time rewinding it to see your favorite songs.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I have not been a Shakira fan for very long, but the first time I heard \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" on the car radio I almost drove off the road. I have never heard anything like it. The instant I heard it I knew I had to get this CD. There is such passion and animation in her music! The fast songs in particular are excellent. I have listened to all of them and they are quite good as well. (...)
B000002A46|5.0|As you would expect from MC, her performance is incredible (perhaps even slightly better than on her other albums) as is the production. Given that this is a Christmas album it surprisingly has lots of different textures and moods - from the sad `Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)' to the joyous, up-beat `Santa Claus Is Coming To Town'. There is quite a bit of gospel influence on here as well as some `pure' interpretations of Christmas carols.<br />I would say that next to `MTV Unplugged' this is her most `musical' album. What you really notice is that MC sounds so relaxed and happy singing these songs and it doesn't sound `forced' or overproduced just really natural - she says in the booklet that Christmas is her favourite time of year and this album is evidence of that joy.<BR>My favourites are:<BR>The understated `Silent Night': MC with the gospel singers and Hammond organ.<BR>`All I Want For Christmas Is You' was the single and is one of the best tracks on here.<BR>The first 40 seconds of `Joy To The World' sounds like HEAVEN and gives me goosebumps. (worth buying just for this section!)<BR>`Jesus Oh What A Wonderful Child': pure gospel magic. This will uplift your spirit, MC really sings her heart out here. And the end section has to be the fastest ever MC track with the choir chanting `Jesus' and MC ad lib-ing over the top. Spine-tingling stuff! <br />Go and buy this truly special album.
0385505833|5.0|We listened to this book on a car trip the Monday after Thanksgiving.  It was perfect timing.  This is a funny book, but the characters seem real.  Listening with others is a great way to &quot;read&quot; this book: you can laugh together.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I will have to say that Shakira has done an excellent job with this English Album.  She has a great voice and unlike Rick Wright's comment, I have to say that she is not trying to immitate Alanis Morriset with her vocal style or leaning towards Celine Dione's style.  I think she has a distinct style and the type of music she makes can not be compared since she combines rock with pop and folk music, all in one album.  I think she is very talented and I am glad to hear a different style of music.  A bit of variations is GREAT!  You go girl :)
B00003CXSP|5.0|Ridley Scott's Hannibal is a film lover's film. The cinematography is eye candy, the score is brilliant, the acting superb, and the story hooks you right in. Recently viewing Silence of the Lambs again, I feel that Silence and Hannibal strive to be two totally different films. Jonathan Demme's opus was more about mood and psychological havoc, where Ridley Scott's is more about the scenery, physical pain, and shcoking suspense. Both films are brilliant in their own respects. But I find that Hannibal is more stylish and sleek. it has more showmanship pulsing through its maniacal veins. I can't praise the cinematography enough. I love every moment the film is in Italy. This will gain the respect it deserves in time. Virtually panned by many critics, this is destined to have itself a cult status. It is marvelous. Ridley Scott never ceases to impress me. Bravo!
0375707972|5.0|The Reader captivated me from the outset and never let go. It is one of the most moving books I've ever read. It's also the only book that my book club has unanimously loved in the 2 years that we've been meeting. I can't imagine anyone not feeling as if they've learned something valuable about human nature after reading it.  If you only read one book this year, make it The Reader.
B000003TAR|5.0|Sure, we all know what unfortunately became of Kurt Cobain after the release of this record, and now, years later, it is all the more apparent that this was bound to happen. Espescially with this album. The songs were raw, angst-filled, angry, and self-loathing. There are some seriously scary lyrics in this. Cobain was at the end of his rope and he felt that the noose was tightening. They say that in pain the best art is created. There has never been a more obvious example of that statement.<BR>The album is incredible. All the way from &quot;Serve the Servants&quot; to &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot; to &quot;All Apologies&quot; to &quot;Very Ape.&quot; Every song is a masterwork. The lyrics are intense, disturbing, and most importantly sincere. the album is a dark tour of someone who has lost all hope for themself. This is truly tragic considering what a wonderful person he was. These uncensored feelings are what make this album an essential recording. Cobain ended his life feeling that he never ammounted to anything, but there are millions of fans, myself included, that owe him more than he would have ever understood. He will always be missed.
B00002E285|5.0|I first saw PINK FLOYD-THE WALL at a friend's house about ten years ago. I saw it again on cable a few years later. Although I have not seen it in 5-6 years, I have never forgotten most of it.  It is more than just memorable, though: it still gives me chills when I just think about it. (Boy, it's getting kind of chilly in here right now!)<br />I have to disagree with the editorial reviewer: sure, this is probably one of the most depressing films ever made (which is why I can only watch it in a certain mood), and it IS relentlessly bleak, but that was obviously what was intended in the first place. I also don't think that this film lost any of the humor from Roger Water's lyrics; just watch the &quot;Young Lust&quot; scene with the girls in the police station!<br />This isn't a film where plot really matters, anyway: it is a film about images, emotional feelings (namely alienation), and style. PINK FLOYD-THE WALL is not so much a movie as it is (as described above) an ultrasensory and visceral experience, and it does succeed very well as pure entertainment.  Many of the live-action scenes are cool, and the animation sequences are nothing short of brilliant and mesmerizing. Leonard Maltin describes this as the &quot;longest rock video to date&quot; but that is a simplistic description. You do not have to &quot;be high&quot; to enjoy this film; I wasn't on either occasion when I saw it. <br />Director Alan Parker did a wonderful job in taking on the very difficult task of visualizing Pink Floyd's THE WALL, the album. Boomtown Rats singer (and eventual Band-Aid and Live-Aid organizer) Bob Geldof makes a striking film debut in the title role of Pink Floyd, a rock star who becomes increasingly alienated from everything around him until he just breaks. The resulting film is entertaining, disturbing, and definitely earns its &quot;R&quot; rating--it is not for any child under the age of 15, or even 16. In the almost twenty years since PINK FLOYD-THE WALL was first released,neither its power nor its stature has diminished. Just look at the fact that this is the 185th review written of it on these pages!  Obviously, this incredible film still provokes thought and discussion today, every bit as much as it did in 1982.  I can't wait to get it on DVD--look, it's in my Wish List! :)
B000002LEE|5.0|Though their albums are few, Jane's Addiction is one of the most influential bands of the early nineties alterna-scene. They had a vision all their own. It embodied every eclectic taste that the four members had in their bones. This taste would evevtually explode into the lollapalooza tour. The Nothing's Shocking lyrics are so abstract, yet so easily accessible. &quot;Jane Says&quot;, the finest track on the album, and may be their greatest song, is a bitter-sweet story of an addict named Jane. I love the lyrics &quot;I'm gonna kick tomorrow.&quot; It's like she's said these very same words before, and may actually belive them, but the resolve is not sincere. She still ends up coming back to the same abusive lifestyle. This song defines the attitude of the entire album; self-reflecting jams about hope and dremas that we all carry inside of ourselves. Whatever those dreams are, we all want to hang onto them more than anything in the whole world. And sometimes, those dreams get away. &quot;Jane Say's I'm-a-goin' away to Spain when I get my money saved. Gonna Start tomorrow. I'm gonna kick tomorrow.&quot;
0451169514|5.0|Welcome to a new familiar world. Derry, Maine could be a nice little town like any small town U.S.A. , but filtered through the mind of Stephen King, it becomes the likeness of pure Hell. Mr. Kings mind is a womb which gestates pure evil.<BR>Coming up for the plot of this story would be a magnificient feat in itself, but the way it is scripted is pure poetry in prose. <BR>To sum up the plot without giving away the details, I will tell you this:   Seven kids discover an evil in their hometown of Derry, Maine and decide to do something about it. Twenty-seven years later they are called back to do battle once again. That is the plot in two basic sentences. You may ask why there are 1,000+ pages in this book. It is the way the story is told. Stephen King brings back every touch, every sight, every smell of a child that you would swear you were there. Most important, he brings back every fear of a child. If you were afraid of it when you were a kid, chances are, you will read about it in this book. As an added bonus; I can almost guarantee that you will have that same lumpy feeling in your throat, and that same burning feeling in your guts as you read this. Simply put: Mr. King takes you for a ride on the freeway of terror, and all along the way you don't want to get off, but you make sure you know where the exit ramps are located. <BR>If you remember walking home after dark as a kid, and that feeling of being watched quickens your pace to a dead sprint: READ THIS BOOK. If you remember leaving your closet lights on at night to thwart any would-be monstorous attackers: READ THIS BOOK. Most importantly: If you were or are that person who is afraid to walk over storm drains in the street: READ THIS BOOK (with the closet lights on)!!!!!!!!<BR>So read this book, and welcome to a new familiar world, you will get the hell out if you know whats good for you.<BR>P.S. My only complaint is this:   I just bought and read this book. The only available editions I could find were the new paperback editions with the picture of the clown skull on the cover. The publisher redid all of Stephen King's covers for the paperback editions. Let me tell you that as a person who enjoys the &quot;total package &quot; of a book, I find these covers cheesy and very degrading to the story contained within. If you are like me, I suggest that you find a hardcover edition on-line with an origional cover, as I plan to do the same.
0385505833|1.0|The characters were whiney and rather irritating to just read about!  Rather disappointed after loving A Painted House.
0784011222|2.0|This prequel is a lot like the first sequel(though why this deserved an 18 certificate unlike that one I don't know).Sure,there are some fantastic action sequences,with explosions,gunfights and chases galore.But Stallone is as mysteriously wooden as he was in the before sequel.In the original First Blood,he spent the majority of the film being wooden as well,but then right at the very end when the he runs into Richard Crenna's colnell character,he explodes into an endless turrey of emotions,which explain why he spends most of the film in a blank,trance-like state.Here,and in FB Part 2,he is simply deprived of expression throughout.Also,the movie lacks engaging dialogue and a solid central villain.Worth watching perhaps for the exciting bits,but you can leave your brain in neutral throughout.Don't forget Crenna made his own self mocking appearance in this film's parody Hot Shots!Part Deux.
0525946284|4.0|One of the earliest books in this genre that I read was the, \\"Eye Of The Needle\\". The author has since ranged widely amongst a variety of subjects, however with, \\"Jackdaws\\", Mr. Follett returns to World War II just prior to the Invasion Of Normandy. And like his previous efforts with this historical setting it is very well done, and will bring fond memories to those readers who were waiting for him to turn his pen once again to this theme.<br />The book is a substantial work offering readers well over 400 pages of taught writing that unfolds over a little more than a week prior to D-Day. Like all books of this event it contains heroes, however they play against the background here, as a heroine takes charge of the story as well as the events in the book. The book begins with a notation that states that 50 women worked as secret agents in France for The Special Executive during the war. The book never seems to reach the moniker of historical fiction, although comments at the end strongly insinuate there was a real woman who, at the very least provided the inspiration for the heroine, \\"Flick\\". The women who volunteered to serve behind enemy lines in occupied France, and repeatedly traveled back and forth across The Channel during the war were clearly remarkable women, and were as fearless as any of their male counterparts.<br />This novel is a bit scattered in its tone. The changes in the mood of the book work well as a whole, however they can seem a bit jarring and out of place as the book is read. If very graphic descriptions of the most brutal interrogation of both men and women are an issue, several areas of this book will be troublesome to read. I don't feel the length to which Mr. Follett took the level of detail was necessary, he is a wonderful writer, and many of these dungeon settings with their attendant horrors struck me as gratuitous. The main event of the book will either work well for a reader, or will be dismissed as being far too improbable. Mr. Follett increases the likelihood of the latter response as the team that is selected is from a practical standpoint untrained but for Flick, and their conduct is so outrageous it tests the reader's ability to suspend disbelief. There are always amazing true stories conducted by a group that should have a near zero chance of prevailing, however Mr. Follett takes the group a step further by making them all fairly dysfunctional as individuals. This is a bit like the stories of a group of jailed soldiers being granted a chance at redemption. The difference is they are at least soldiers, again with the exception of Flick, the group ranges as far as a member who can be likened to Julie Andrews in Victor Victoria, albeit reversed.<br />As odd as it may sound in conclusion I did very much enjoy the book. The only rationale I can offer is that the Heroine Flick was a wonderful character, beautifully written, and as competent as any Special Forces Operative. So while there may be bits that will make a reader wince with incredulity, read on. This is very much a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.t increases the likelihood of the latter response as the team that is selected is from a practical standpoint untrained but for Flick, and their conduct is so outrageous it tests the reader's ability to suspend disbelief.

B00003CXTG|1.0|I was very disappointed with the DVD version of this innacurate and boring movie and definitely will not buy the Director's Cut when it comes out next year.  An additional aggravation was the use of a very tiny font for the subtitles in the Japanese language scenes.  I was sitting about 10 feet away from a 20&quot; TV and could hardly read them!  I ended up turning on the Spanish subtitles (English closed-captioning was not available for the Japanese language scenes) in order to understand what was going on!
0812550706|5.0|I've heard Orson Scott Card say himself that when attempting to describe, explain or otherwise summarize science-fiction it just ends up sounding stupid so, I'm not even gonna attempt that.<br />I love this book, I've read it multiple times and continue to be enthralled with the story. A rather simple story of triumph brought into the not too distant future. I recommend you read it, it is an easy read and well worth the investment. (You'll want to check out the &quot;parallel novels&quot; as well).<br />The following trilogy is a bit more adult, that is - in style, but every bit as intriguing even if it isn't as simple.
0792844793|5.0|With eraserhead, the elephant man, and failed sci-fi epic Dune behind him, Lynch finally became what we associate him with today. In this movie he capture the unsecurity, hidden strangeness and illusionary safeness of &quot;Any Town USA&quot;. It's a meeting of surreal, almost kafka-like labyrint fantasy and fifties-styled small town noir.<BR>The evil gangster leader (played by Dennis Hopper) bares smultarity with later Lynch monsters, for exampel BOB in twin peaks, and the mafia boss in Lost Highway.<br />It's a thriller seen from the perspective of the naiv voyaeur. A thriller that does'nt give either psychological, political or social explenetaions, but rather scares us with it's total silence. <BR>When the movie is over, we can´t really find out if the story is over. It ends where it begins, happy and colourful. But the little happy bird singing in the last scene is actually a mecanic toy. <BR>Where do we go from now?

B00005O3VC|4.0|Although I rather enjoyed the all-around silliness and just plain weirdness of the MPFC telly show, it never delivered the laughs like the troupes' first original cinematic outing did. Oh sure, I got a chortle or two from the 'Funniest Joke In The World' sketch, and especially the 'Cannibal Undertaker' bit, but for some real gut-busting moments, no previous or subsequent Python venture ever hit the mark as well as their quest for the Holy Grail. Knowing that Graham Chapman was on the sauce the whole time whilst shooting the movie made things even more entertaining!<br />Then there's that one great thing about having this flick on disc: I no longer have to hang out at the local midnight cult-matinee bijou! Nevermore must I stoically suffer the Python uber-geeks' annoying verbatim reciting of entire scenes from the flick and/or TV eppies, complete with really bad attempts at Cockney brogues and worse comic timing. Please, take a hint and leave British sketch comedy to the professionals, all right? Sheesh- and just when I thought Trekkies trying to imitate the halting speech patterns of Captain Kirk set the benchmark for obnoxious geek fandom! But, at least the Pythonphiles don't throw Spam or voles at the screen, like those black-leather-teddy-&amp;-bustier-clad (and the women are dressed strangely as well!) 'Rocky Horror' freakos do with their toast &amp; hot dogs. Great, there's people starvin' in some third-world country somewhere, and these retro-goth wanna-bes are flingin' the heat-crisped bread &amp; processed meat links around like they're freakin' frisbees or something! <br />But I digress. Sadly, when it came to this movie's initial distribution on DVD (A.K.A. the UN-special edition), I was caught up in the notion that it would be the only version to be put out on the digital video market. I never anticipated the Pythons throwing out a special-edition pressing, which is eventually what happened as you can plainly see. But, looking back, I really should've seen it coming. After all, 'Life Of Brian', considered the best of the MPFC flicks by most (myself excluded), went the same route- given the Criterion Collection treatment, no less! Trailers, commentary tracks, the works! Great- now I gotta shell out several more bucks to make my Python DVD collection REALLY complete! Fortunately, I managed to sell my old 'MP&amp;HG' platter on eBay for just a little less than what I originally paid for it; that helped things out quite a bit.<br />But, enough of my tangential prattling; time for my review of the features &amp; extras! This baby's broken down into your basic 2-disc special edition format. Disc 1 is the movie itself, along with not one, but two commentary tracks by our beloved chaps. The first one features co-directors Gilliam &amp; Jones. Although he's from the U.S., it's fairly apparent that Gilliam's stay in the British Isles has affected his vocabulary &amp; accent a bit. During his discussion about the people going to theatres to see MP&amp;HG, he referred to the lines of moviegoers as a queue (I think that's how it's spelled... it's pronounced 'cue') of moviegoers. Both he and Jones discuss the highs &amp; lows of producing &amp; filming the movie, including the revelation that much of MP&amp;HG was financed by members of Pink Floyd, the Beatles, and other British pop/rock groups. Then there's the other three surviving Pythons droning on and basically wigging out on the secondary commentary track. <br />Then there's disc 2, which features just about every imaginable extra you can... um... imagine. There's the 45-minute retrospective documentary where Jones &amp; Palin revisit the various locations that were used to film the flick. Much of it was shot at one particular Scottish castle; the rest of it around various parts of the Scottish countryside. One of my fave extras are the sample segments dubbed in Japanese, with their English translations in subtitles. Now you can see King Arthur &amp; Co. begin their quest for the holy sake cup, and complete the Knights Who Say 'Ni!'s demand to find them a bonsai! Hmm... methinks something got lost in the translation...<br />There's also pics of various promotional posters, bills, and the like. Then there's the two theatrical trailers that are, sadly, pretty much the same... 'cept different. Also included are bunches of other things- singalongs, behind-the-scenes photos, Gilliam's concept sketches, and much more that I can't really list in too much detail 'cuz I'd go over my 1000-word allotment for this review if I did! Of course, if I removed my previous rant concerning Rocky Horror fans, that'd likely free up enough word space to continue my recap of this DVD's extras. I mean, it was rather mean-spirited, wasn't it? Then of course there were my snide remarks about naive Ebay bidders. So maybe I should-- naaahhh...<br />The whole deal even includes a semi-rigid mylar slipcover for the snap case! Unfortunately, the mylar apparently isn't very durable- I had to exchange this set twice because the slipcover got cracked in transit both times! It made for a frustrating demonstration of the hazards of purchasing things online. Fortunately, in this case the third time was indeed the charm. The slipcover also has a lenticular finish- you know, like those trading cards where there's two separate pictures on the same card. You look at it from one angle, there's one image. Then when you turn it a bit, another picture appears. Except in this case, there's no different images; it's just put on there to make the slipcover shiny &amp; stuff. What a gyp!<br />'Late
B00003CX9Q|5.0|Having made quite an impact on audiences from the time of its theatrical release to the present day, Steven Speilberg's &quot;E.T. The Extra Terrestrial&quot; is one of the great movies of all time, a classic that lives up to the hype and popularity it has attained over the last two decades. Here is a movie that has proved itself as a true success, a standout film that still has not lost its ability to dazzle the young and old with its touching story and likeable characters. <br />I remember years ago to my childhood, when Thanksgiving was just not Thanksgiving without watching the movie play on television each year, to be replaced later with modern, though less enjoyable, holiday films. As a child, the movie filled me with a sense of awe and wonderment, tickling my funny bone while at the same time evoking dread and suspense as it draws near to its spectacular and unforgettable conclusion. Watching the movie today allows me to look back at this experience and realize that the movie still carries the same emotional strings for me. <br />The story of a young boy named Elliot who befriends a space alien left behind on Earth embodies great spirit, carrying with it the lessons of friendship, devotion, and love. Elliot, who names his new friend E.T., begins teaching the arrival the ways of humankind, sharing the secret with his siblings, who are equally entranced by the terrestrial. <br />These are some of the warmest moments in movie history, burning themselves into our hearts forever. The child in all of us easily finds a soft spot for the short-statured creature, who waddles along in a manner that steals the heart. One cannot help but instantly fall in love with E.T., whose thirst for knowledge is evident in his wide, endearing eyes. His innocence, and the warm nature of his friendship with Elliot, make the movie's final act a tour de force of emotion, from suspense of tears, sadness to joy. We will always remember the bicycle ride, a stunning display of special effects that actually have heart and soul to them, and an ending that is warm and meaningful.<br />Just as the creature earns a place in history, so do the human characters, acted under some very effective performances. Henry Thomas possesses terrific talent, and his performance as Elliot remains emotionally sweeping even by today's standards. Dee Wallace Stone is great as Elliot's mother, while Robert MacNaughton and a young Drew Barrymore are wonderful as his siblings. <br />&quot;E.T.&quot; has earned itself a place in movie history, and deserves its praise and more. The film is a composition of sheer brilliance, a feast for the eyes and the heart that is captivating and enthralling. Watching it as a child proves to be the best experience, though those who watch it later in years may be tempted to recall their first experience with the film, which has an endearing nature that outshines most other films.
0385505833|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much-especially at this time of year.  When the story begins at the airport and Luther is griping about the parking, I knew that the author had experienced such a situation.  As it progressed I enjoyed it even more.  The people are very real and the humorous way he points out the materialism of the American holiday season is wonderful. Those who look for deeper meaning are missing the point. I never thought of John Grisham as a humorist before this book but he certainly displayed that side of his writing persona here.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I was surfing channels one nite when I stumbled on a half-hour MTV diary special featuring Pink.  I stopped surfing and watched the whole thing.  She expressed a certain profound confidence and understanding of fame that I found intriguing.  She came across as owning the whole pop fame scene; she is above it on a very personal level - as more than one of her songs states, she can't be broken.  I bought her CD and fell in love with song after song.  There is a raw willingness to expose her innermost self in most of the songs on Missundaztood.  As a recently divorced father of a beautiful young daughter, I can honestly say that 'Family Portrait' is the saddest song I have ever heard in my entire life.  Pink is a complex and old soul that, whether she fully realizes it or not, has captured an enormous amount of human experience in her CD - it has tremendous depth.  If you like R&amp;B, Pop, Rock, and want to hear something with a range of everything from youthful exuberance to soulful wisdom (way beyond Pink's physical age of 20) get this CD.  It is the most wonderful thing I have heard in years.
B00005ASOC|5.0|First saw this film on a flight from Greece to the U.S.; as long as the trip was, watching &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; made it incredibly enjoyable.  I purchased the DVD as soon as I could and shared it with my family.  So far, everyone I've recomended it to has loved it.  You will laugh, you will cry, you will be changed forever.
B00000DHR0|4.0|Celine Dion's These Are Special Times is one of the better Christmas album out from a pop singer thanks to the choice of songs.There's traditional favorites O Holy Night,The Magic Of Christmas Day,Ave Maria and O Come All Ye Faithful.As always Celine does an excellent job on vocals and makes these worthwhile remakes.She also covers Blue Christmas,The Christmas Song and Happy X'mas(War Is Over) and with her family singing with her Feliz Navidad and the French song Les Cloches Du Hameau.There's also new songs Another Year Has Gone By,Don't Save It All For Christmas Day,Theres Are The Special Times and the upbeat Christmas Eve.Celine also does two duets I'm your Angel with R. Kelly and The Prayer with Andrea Bocelli.For some reason theres the song Brahms Lullaby which doesn't have a Christmas theme.The best songs are O Come All Ye Faithful,Happy X'mas (War Is Over)and The Prayer Andrea and Celine's singing make this a beautiful and moving song.These Are Special Times is nothing new or different but compared to most pop Christmas albums this one is worth listening to.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This dvd is the greates ever. First the story is fantastic I feel like I was there fight with our American Heros. Secondly the best sound does it justic Its DTS the best . Finaly for those who like war movies this is a must to own .
B00005OM4Q|4.0|(THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE &quot;UNTITLED - BOOTLEG CUT&quot; DVD SET)<br />(4 and 1/2 stars) Since there are many reviews of the movie itself already available, I will focus here on what's in the &quot;Untitled&quot; DVD set.<br />--- The extra scenes in the &quot;Director's Cut&quot; give more depth to the characters and connect the story together even better.  It's not that there's anything amazing in the extra stuff (or else it would have been in the theatrical version), but it's certainly fun to watch - especially the scene with a stoned DJ interviewing the band.<br />--- The &quot;Cleveland Concert&quot; is actually just 3 songs, 15 minutes long.  Interesting to watch, good music, although it does sound like studio recordings with a bit of crowd noise before and after the songs.  (No crowd noise at moments during the songs where it might be appropriate.)<br />--- The music CD has 6 songs by the fictional group Stillwater.  The last 3 sound as if they're the same exact recordings as in the &quot;Cleveland Concert.&quot;  Still, this is one of the attractions that got me to buy the set, and it's something to play in the stereo or in the car.  (I wonder why these songs weren't on the soundtrack CD though?)<br />--- I enjoyed hearing Mr. Crowe's rundown of the &quot;Top Albums of 1973.&quot;  He explains the enduring value of each of CDs by Bowie, the Stones, Jackson Browne and others.<br />--- The infamous &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; scene is finally released.  I expected it on the previous DVD edition, but at last now I was able to do the interactive thing of playing my own Zep CD along with the scene.  It is kind of an amusing scene, and gives us a chance to watch Crowe's mom playing one of the teachers.<br />--- Several of the other extras were worthwhile, like the Nancy Wilson demo for one of the Stillwater songs.  I enjoyed it even more than the Stillwater version.
B00005JKHP|5.0|The original release of this film was rushed to meet production deadlines, and as a result it was an editing nightmare. However, with this &quot;directors cut&quot; that problem has been solved. The plotline makes more sense and some bad acting shots (like Sulu staring wide-eyed into the camera and gulping alot) have been cut. The story is thoughtful and intelligent and has more the essence of the original series. Later films tended to be more star wars-ish and built around space battles. The new FX scenes have given it an epic feel and made it by far the most beautiful of the series to look at. I only wish this cut could have been shown in theatres. It would be awesome on a big screen. Suffice to say this: I did not regret forking out the moolah to purchase this DVD and consider it one of the best in my collection. It is the best justification Ive yet seen for making 'directors cuts'.
0451196716|5.0|I thought Stephen King did an excellent job keeping my attention in The Long Walk. I'm not much of a reader and I must say this book makes me want to read more often. I really like the way Stephen King doesn't clue you in on what is going to happen next. He surprised me through out the whole book. I never expected 'buying a ticket' meant death. I honestly thought it meant a ticket to go back home. From the moment I found out what a 'ticket' really was I did not want to put the book down at all. When i did need to stop reading I couldn't help but wonder what was going to happen next and who would be the next to 'buy a ticket'. Stephen King kept me on the edge of my seat at all times with the unexpected occuring.Another aspect of this book I like is the way I feel like I personally know the characters, especially Ray Garraty. Although you don't know much about the characters when the book starts, you find out more and more of almost every character as the Walk goes on through the stories the boys share with one another. Stephen King uses such great descriptions I could see the boys walking down the streets like I was there myself. The ending of the book took me by complete surprise. Honestly, I didn't understand it at first and had to read it a couple more times and have my mom explain it to me. This was the way I didnt want the book to end and it even made me upset. I can proudly say I am very happy I chose this book as an outside reading project for school and will most definitly read it in the future. This was absolutely the best book I have read so far. {=0)

B0000584V3|5.0|Let me just say that I, umm, don't care for death metal. Even when the oft-talented musicians are doing more than unleashing dissonant slop, the &quot;cookie monster&quot; vocals usually turn me off. Opeth is...<br />Err, wait. I'm getting ahead of myself. To simply call Opeth &quot;death metal&quot; is lazy and does them no justice. Vocalist Mikael Akerfeldt can unleash a growl so utterly demonic it sounds inhuman, but I think beyond that Opeth's parallels to death metal are scarce. Opeth is better described as the bizarre marriage of metal brutality and pastoral elegy. Without a doubt, Blackwater Park is full of crashing guitars and brutal growls, yet Opeth balances with melodic acoustic passages and vocal deliveries with icy beauty. Often, these elements are encompassed entirely by one song. The 10-minute opener, &quot;The Leper Affinity,&quot; begins with flaming guitar riffs and bestial vocals, but as you approach the 5-minute mark, the heaviness falls away to be replaced by delicate clean singing and a dreamy acoustic section. Even at its heaviest, Blackwater Park remains surprisingly melodic, with fluid guitar lines and ear-catching riffs. Opeth is clearly more about dynamics of light &amp; shade than the conventional sonic mire of other similar bands. (Although, truth be told, there aren't really other bands like Opeth.) Producer Steve Wilson (Porcupine Tree, No-Man) doesn't seem like the right guy for the job...at least on paper. But Wilson's background makes him the perfect choice. His ear for sonic clarity and arrangement are surpassed by few, and he is a wonderful complement to the band's ambition.<br />&quot;Harvest&quot; is gorgeous. Layers of acoustic guitars, sparkling overlays of electric chords, and the chilling, beautiful vocals of Akerfeldt. It's probably my favorite song on the album. That's because I can't really listen to lots of the stuff here. The death vox are just too much for me. On a purely subjective level, I wouldn't give this disc 5-stars.<br />But forget that subjectivity. Sometimes you just have to admire what's being done, even if it's not your own cup of tea. Objectively speaking, Opeth is original and talented. If you like (or even tolerate) death metal vocals, I _strongly_ recommend you try Opeth. If you absolutely hate death vox, skip it. (Although I usually hate 'em but I tried this, so whatever.) Blackwater Park is unique, progressive, heavy, and sometimes beautiful. If you take the plunge, you may be turned off by the oppressively cold and bleak sound (plus some unhappy lyrics). But be patient. Allow its grandeur to unfold. You might be blown away like so many others.tars.<br />But forget that subjectivity. Sometimes you just have to admire what's being done, even if it's not your own cup of tea.

0743420373|1.0|I was robbed! - and  don't mean by Amazon.  I bought this book in hopes of gaining some insight on how the wealthy became so.  The book has one exhaustingly repetitive point.  That point is that if you never buy anything nice for yourself, you could be \\"rich\\" [standard set by author] while only flipping burgers and dipping fries.  This makes sense, but I disagree with the good doctor's contention of wealth.  Furthermore, if you followed the preachings of the book, you wouldn't buy it anyway...  It would be a $... luxury you simply couldn't afford if you wanted to stay on track to a wealthy life.
B00005QK3W|4.0|As I write this, it is really starting to sink in that there are only 2 Beatles left now. First of all, all sympathy and love should go out to Olivia, Dhani, Paul, Ringo, and all those afffected by George Harrison's passing into the next realm. God rest his soul. Perhaps this is making me think of the album in a different light. All opinions are subjective, but I want to give a track by track rundown of why you should buy this album.<br /><br />First of all, you probably should get Flaming Pie, Wingspan, McCartney, Tug of War, Flowers in The Dirt, Back To The Egg, Band on The Run, and Wings Over America as starters before this one. You have to hear where Paul has been musicly before this album. I would recommend this up there, but only in conjunction with some or all of the above albums. Also, this album is best listened to as one complete work.<br /><br />Lonely Road- Bass filled rocker. It starts out a little slow, but picks up steam after about 30 seconds. Seems to be about Paul's feelings after Linda's passing and trying to get over losing her.  It also deals with finding someone again. A familiar feeling of love. Good slide guitar.<br /><br />From A Lover To A Friend- According to Paul, Ringo picked this as  the first single. Dealing with loss of Linda. His emotion is great in the song. I probably would have used this as a second or third single.<br /><br />She's Given Up Talking- The start samples the radio intro from Broadcast (1979 Back to the Egg). He uses drums and a distorted vocal. Lyrics are ok, but could have been better. I would have put this as a b-side and not on the album. To me, not the strongest track.<br /><br />Driving Rain- Yes, you have heard there is the 12345 couting part. Besides that, the song is excellent. Very pop oriented and his vocal is great. He doesn't sound 59 years old on this one.<br /><br />I Do- To me this is phrased a bit like No More Lonely nights meets I will. Hard to describe. He uses light orchestra on this one, along with acoustic guitar and bass. Again, this seems to state love for Heather.<br /><br />Tiny Bubble-Good vocal. Soulful. Hey, Al Green is on this record! Well, that is who it sounds like. Funky little number. Good listener.<br /><br />Magic-About Paul first meeting Linda in 1967. He also wonders what might have happened had they not met.<br /><br />Your Way-Country flavored track. Probably the most basic track on the album.<br /><br />Spinning On An Axis-James plays guitar on this one. Long song at over 5:00. He sings in part of a spoken word style. Almost like a rap, but not quite. This one could've been edited or cut.<br /><br />About You- This should have been the first single! Rocking, amazing. Sounds like late Beatles/early Wings Paul singing. Rocking guitar and he pauses for 1 second near the middle. Sung with feeling and raw energy. This is one of the tracks that really gets the album for me.<br /><br />Heather-Mostly instrumental. Nice piano piece. Gues who it's about?<br /><br />Back In The Sunshine Again- Sounds like the brother of Souveneir off of Flaming Pie. Same voice. Bluesy rock song. Also could have been a singe contender. Lovely song. About moving on and getting back into the rythm of life.<br /><br />Your Loving Flame- Piano piece with guitar solo. AKA Chase My Blues Away/ New York Song as heard on the Parkinson Show in 1999.  Great guitar solo about 1:00 into the song. Also should have been a single. This sounds like one of the better songs from Off The Ground.<br /><br />Riding Into Jaipur-Indian piece. One vocal repeated over and over. Interesting experiement. With all due respect to Paul, George mastered this sound much better. Still, perhaps George is smiling down now as I play it during this review.<br /><br />Rinse The Raindrops- You Know My Name Look Up The Number meets Rockestra!! A 10 minute jam. Some call this pretentious, but this is worth the album alone! Paul's voice absolutely screams out the lyrics in some parts of the song. Simply awesome!<br /><br />Freedom- Enhanced live performance from the Conert for New York City. Catchy song. Still, I would've done a studio version. This is, of course, a tribute song to the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks on New York, Washington, and in Pennsylvania.<br /><br />All in all a great album. The track listing is on ths inside of the album. On the back is various photos taken by Paul on his Casio watch. The album takes time to grow and really does get even better on each listen. It is not one of Paul's best, but is good.<br /><br />Perhaps Paul could concentrate on one really last great cd in early 2004 (I'm thinking Feb. 9, 2004 release). Hopefully we won't need to wait 4 years to hear more music from Paul.dio version. This is, of course, a tribute song to the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks on New York, Washington, and in Pennsylvania.

B00005QK3W|1.0|I am a big McCartney fan and rush to buy his music.  I will listen to everything over and over again....dissecting his voice, his lyrics, his harmonies and his back up vocals.  I eagerly await to see the album covers and read everything possible on the inserts.<BR>However...<BR>Driving rain sounds like an undeveloped Paul McCartney singing because he is the legendary Paul McCartney.   Many melodies are remenisent of previous McCartney tunes.  Some songs are strong but then he gets into a very weak &quot;la la la&quot; stage or a 1,2,3,4,5 thing.  Couldn't quite come up with rhyming words.<br />Although his voice is strong, his song &quot;Freedom&quot; is weak.  I was embarassed for him when he repeated the song on stage in the NYC concert.  Other songs lack content...just the chorus too many times in one song.  Again, I feel he is just recording songs because he is Paul McCartney.<br />It is not what I expected from Paul and I was extremely disappointed.<br />Also, his album cover and additional pictures aren't much to be desired.  I'd like to see them rather than be a distant haze.<br />I will praise him on his melody for the song titled 'Heather'.  It is a magical journey full of excitment and love...a bit like Yanni.  The first time I heard it, I played it over and over again.  It is beautiful.  I wish the tune was longer and that the entire album took on that powerful feeling.<br />Sorry Sir Paul....You put out a dud!
6301050673|4.0|The final Missing in Action adventure is really just a remake of the first film, with a family oriented twist.  When Colonel James Braddock (Chuck Norris) discovers that the girlfriend he believed dead is not only still alive, but that he had fathered a son as well, it takes him all of a millinanosecond to start preparing yet another single handed sneak attack on the PRV to get them out of there.  Chuck's longtime stunt co-ordinator brother Aaron made his directing debut with this formula movie and he didn't do that bad of a job.  Norris fans will find this hard to dislike.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|I am the most cynical person I know. But after all these years, like a alcoholic at his first alcoholic anonymous class embarrassed to say 'I am an alcoholic.' I have to say this....'My n ame is Dave, and I....I..... like a-ha. Many friends I have lost over this aforementioned statement, I try to bluff people by saying....\\"Oh I really like the Beatles and Oasis and Simple Minds and Coldplay,\\" but it finally comes round to \\" I like a-ha\\" When I bought this album, I desperately hoped it would be garbage, then I could end saying the statement \\"I like a-ha\\" but to my dismay, the album was bloody marvellous, and my friends are leaving me at a rate of knots. Come on a-ha, do me a favour and release something that's rubbish, I need friends. (But seriously, this is the best album that I've bought in a long, long time. It's not pretentious, or monotonous. And everyone who I've played it to, says the same.)

0792101448|5.0|Occasionally, one encounters an example of film, music, etc. which transcends its genre to become a major artistic achievement. &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; does exactly that. Director Sergio Leone did virtually nothing that he hadn't done in his string of prior westerns; this time he created a work of stunning beauty, riveting tension and dense emotional impact.<br />The bare bones outline of the story (written by Leone, Bernardo Bertoluci and Dario Argento) is almost a western cliche: unscrupulous railroad tycoon wants land owned by local homesteader and sends hired gunman to persuade him to vacate. Gunman kills homesteader but homesteader's widow, with help from locals, triumphs in the end. But reducing this movie to the above is like Woody Allen describing &quot;War and Peace&quot; as &quot;about some Russians&quot;. Gabriele Ferzetti, as Morton (using crutches and wearing a neck brace) hires gunman Frank (Henry Fonda) to &quot;clear away obstacles&quot; as his railway extends. Fonda plays about the most chilling villain in movie history. Utterly amoral and with a sadistic element barely concealed by his coldness Frank murders an entire family (including the young son). When Morton later admonishes &quot;I told you only to scare them&quot; Frank answers matter of factly &quot;People scare better when they're dyin'&quot;.<br />Opposing Morton and Frank are characters whose goodness lies well below layers of complexity. Widow Jill, played by Claudia Cardinale, is a former New Orleans whore, taking advantage of a marriage proposal in order to begin again. She projects alternating facades of toughness and fragility, concealing real durability. she's unafraid to do whatever is required for survival but does spend a lot of time being bullied by the men around her and she immediately elicits our concern. The brilliant Jason Robards plays local outlaw, Cheyenne, who has cowed the entire community, but finds it in himself to care about Jill and to take up hercause. Laconic Charles Bronson is Harmonica (so named by Cheyenne), a man who is tailing Frank. Beyond this we know nothing and learn little until the end.<br />Like most Leone works, &quot;Once...&quot; is a visual treat (one should consider the surprising aesthetic effect his visuals had on an audience used to the comparitavely tepid Hollywood Western). The director outdoes himself here, using Montana's Monument Valley to great effect and rendering his characters true to period (grimy, unkenpt and probably malodorous) and simultaneously visually arresting. He uses lengthy shots of the actor's eyes, particularly in the climactic scene. Fonda's blues convey the icy murderousness of his character and a little squint by Bronsonsets up the &quot;why&quot; of their relationship. Leone's long stills, whether of people or scenery do not bore, rather small tics, gestures and movements become heightened in importance.<br />In addition, the score by Ennio Morricone is brilliant. Each major character has a musical motif which supports without being intrusive. Much of the incidental music is also well done (listen to the percussion/piano background during Frank's shootout with his former employees). Morricone's score also seems to heighten its absence. Long stretches of silence or desert sounds create a tension which slowly builds, then either climaxes or ebbs.<br />I first saw this movie in 1970, not too long after is was released. When I left the theater I found it occupying my head more than just about any film I'd seen to date. I've seen it on late night television about a half dozen times but bad editing turns it into nothing more than a pretty good movie (kind of like trimming &quot;La Guernica&quot; to make wallpaper). I was thrilled to see that it had been released intact and have watched it several times since getting a copy. It still occupies my head for a long time afterward.
0446310786|2.0|I found this book to be dull, uninspiring, and not particularly well-written.  I liked some of the characters, but not enough interesting things occured to keep my attention. I had to read many of the descriptive passages several times to gather their meaning, and the author lets the reader make many assumptions, which are not always correct. I've read a number of excellent classics, but I'm stumped how this could be considered one of them.  I realize this is an unpopular opinion, but aside from a few isolated passages, I really didn't find this book to be very enjoyable.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I've been a fan of Shakira's for a couple of years now (ever since Estoy Aquí), but always wondered when she'd debut in English, and now she's done it with nine tracks (four are in Spanish) on LAUNDRY SERVICE.  LAUNDRY SERVICE is a great collection of songs, albeit eclectic.  There are almost Beachboyish moments; along with earthy real songs where Shakira almost seems disenchanted with life; very \\"pop\\"-inspired songs; and then culturally infused moments, most notably \\"Eyes Like Yours.\\"  Overall, though, Shakira comes off as the Shakira we've always known and loved, just in English.  She HAS NOT \\"sold out,\\" creating an album off pop inspired garbage; instead she's given us an English extension of previous albums, growing and evolving as an artist and part of that is broadening her appeal via English.<br />The latest hit single duo of \\"Whenever, Wherever / Suerte,\\" which aren't exact translations of the other, will instantly grab you.  The instrumentation, fast pace, great lyrics, and the way Shakira sings the song really captures your attention, and deservedly so.  Great two songs!<br />Other headliners include both versions of the spirited, passionate \\"Tango;\\" \\"Underneath Your Clothes,\\" that braves the line of being a little sappy, but is saved by Shakira's singing; earthy \\"Rules;\\" disco-inspired \\"Ready for the Good Times;\\" and seamless, joyful \\"Te Dejo Madrid.\\"  Each song is made memorable by unique instrumentation and the way Shakira incorporates her own little unique exclamations throughout the songs and the authenticity in her lyrics.<br />If you enjoyed any of her Spanish albums, you'll love LAUNDRY SERVICE.
B000002BYD|5.0|This has to be Pearl Jam's greatest album. Lyrically, I have never heard anything better by any other artist -EVER- !!<br />A song-by-song review:<br />1. Brain of J-Thrashy punk rock, fast and hard. This song sounds <BR>              a lot like a combination of Spin the Black Circle <BR>              and Lukin. 8/10<BR>2. Faithful-True Pop! This song is absolutely beautiful-my second<BR>            favorite on this album. The lyrics are odd to <BR>            interpret, at times seemingly a sarcastic statement<BR>            about religious faith, at others a pledge of faith<BR>            to a lover. 10/10<BR>3. No Way-Cool song with a thick, heavy beat. Vocals are a bit<BR>          odd, but cool nonetheless. Uniqe among the Pearl Jam <BR>          catalogue. 7/10<BR>4. Given to Fly-What can I say but Oh My GOD! This song contains<BR>                some of the most beautiful lyrics I've ever heard<BR>                wonderful guitar work, and catchy-yet-original <BR>                drum work. It's a continuing cycle of <BR>                building, building, building and then   <BR>                EXPLODING. This is my favorite song on<BR>                this album and one of my favorite songs of all   <BR>                time. 11/10<BR>5. Wishlist-Very soothing ballad. Not the verse-chorus-verse<BR>            formula most often used. Sarcastic, sedistic, <BR>            pessimistic, and optimistic at the same time, it's<BR>            a great song for any mood. 10/10<BR>6. Pilate-Weird lyrics but not extremely original, but still a <BR>          really good song. 7/10<BR>7. Do the Evolution-Wow! Definitely not Pearl Jam-like. It's a <BR>                    rock-dance song. Catchy beat, cool guitar<BR>                    playful (although cynical) lyrics. 9/10<BR>8. *red dot*-funky weird experimental stuff. Funny and cool. <BR>             Not ratable.<BR>9. MFC-Nice pop/punk type of song. Almost sounds like a Green Day<BR>       song at times. Lyrics are similar to those of RVM. 8/10<BR>10. Low Light-Another soothing ballad. Sounds country-tinged at <BR>              times. Eddie's voice sounds great on this one. 9/10<BR>11. In Hiding-Cool guitar solos (not metal solos, almost <BR>              classical type solos) make this a good one. Eddie<BR>              cries like Neil young on the chorus. Poetic<BR>              and intelligent as well. 9/10<BR>12. All Those Yesterdays-You can tell they were using an <BR>              electronic drum set on this one. Guitar work is a<BR>              bit unoriginal. It's a good song, but my least<BR>              favorite on the album. 5/10<BR>              Hidden track starts shortly after the end. It <BR>              sounds like a Mexican Jig. Funny...like bugs.<br />IF you don't own this album, you should get it. If you don't own any Pearl Jam albums, I suggest you get Ten first, so you can see where they've come from, but this is their greatest!
B000056K04|5.0|If the Dave Matthews Band came out with 10 albums in a row that sounded exactly like the traditional jam stuff that we love, we would get sick of it. Music and musicians change and evolve. Who are we to judge? I admit I wasn't sure about this album when I heard it, BUT I saw the first show on the tour and all of my doubts disappeared. Listen to the lyrics. again. and again. it really grows on you. DMB is recording a new album in January that will probably include Lillywhite Sessions stuff. Everyone calm down. No one has sold out. Only the people who don't support an incredible band.
B0000017CA|5.0|When I first heard Acid Bath, I was captured by the midevil undertone of the music. It was psychadelic. It was grindcore. And the lyrics are the most twisted and evil I've ever heard, even as they're sung beautifully with acoustic guitar. Light some candles, sit back and read the words as you play this Acid Bath cd, at a very high volume. Halfway through, you will find yourself using your imagination to paint disturbing scenes in your mind. And for that, you will love Acid Bath and will have a new understanding of all things considered evil.
B00005R87Q|4.0|...and I don't even have a license!<br />This is pretty good movie. Predictable to an extent, but good.<br />The action scenes are phenomenal. It is your typical guy flick, I will have to admit. Fast cars and hot chicks. <br />Plot: rookie undercover cop trying to bust midnight racers, Racers are trying to make a car that can go a quarter mile in 10 seconds. <br />Not quite gone in 60 seconds caliber but close. ;)
B00005R87Q|1.0|I feel that nearly everyone that's rating this movie are giving it extremely high marks. Give me a break people, let's all take a step back from the &quot;cool&quot; cars and hot women (there wasn't very many) and see this movie for what it really is. . . A cheap, temporary form of entertainment. Face it, in a few, few years anyone who buys this movie is going to end up giving it away or forgetting about (I know I did with ID4). Also, I have to agree with the other viewer that rated this movie with one star--a complete Point Break rip-off. If you really want to see this movie, either rent it or borrow it from a friend, but for- the-love-of-all-things-sacred don't actually buy it.
B00000HYXB|5.0|The wizards return in grand fashion with this amazing release. This is, in my opinion, their best work yet. The range of songs presented here are amazing. They offer a soft melody in the song Nightfall; while giving us a great metal song in The Storm. The top songs on this CD are Mirror, Mirror, Nightfall, and When Time Stands Still. I can not think of any weak points, if I could they would be listed. To make the deal even sweeter, the entire album is about Middle-earth. I could not ask for a better CD.
0689829590|4.0|My two year old boy loves trains, planes and the moon.  This book has helped us to teach him about the different phases.  He can identify a &quot;cresent&quot;, &quot;full&quot; and &quot;quarter&quot; moon.  He likes to look for Monica's pet cat in the pictures.  The fold outs are a fun idea, but not terribly practical with a toddler, although I've been surprised how well they've held up --he hasn't bent them too much.  This is a book he comes back to on his own.  Pictures are great.
0385505833|4.0|John Grisham's latest book is a humorous story about a couple who  decides that they are going to attempt to &quot;skip Christmas.&quot;  It is very comical in a soap-opera kind of way as it moves through the days of December and the mishaps that encounter them.  It is a quick read (one or two sittings) and is successful in delivering the Christmas spirit.  This would be a great read if you want to read over the holiday but haven't a lot of time.
0671024256|5.0|This is an exceptional book on the craft of writing. Stephen King guides you on the road he traveled to become a great writer. This book does not only oultine the tricks of the trade, but goes further to explain the many aspects of writing and how to master them. A must for anyone who has ever played with the idea of becoming a writer.
059035342X|5.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling<BR>A Review by Jordan<BR>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book of the Harry Potter series. The main character, Harry, is orphan as an infant and survives tough times. He is raised by uncaring relatives who make him sleep in a closet under the stairs. All that changes when a giant, bearded stranger named Hagrid appears on Harry's eleventh birthday, tells the boy that he possesses magical powers and then whisks him off to a special school for wizards.<br />I really enjoyed this book, it was a book I just couldn't put down. I really liked the Quiddich matches. I recommend this book to all ages and anyone who just likes the thought of magical powers like, spells, potions, charms, transfiguration, and flying broomsticks. The characters were great they had the Hero, the Brains, the comic relief, and the good friend. To find out who's who read this book. There was nothing I didn't like about this book it was very well written, great characters, and overall just a great story. So, that's why I give this book five stars.

B000002A46|5.0|At this stage of her career Mariah Carey does not need to prove herself, but her voice is so powerful that with each new recording she, once again, reminds you: &quot;Listen to what I can do.&quot; Vocal gymnastics and Christmas songs are not often thought of as a compatible combination, but on MERRY CHRISTMAS Mariah jumps, climbs, crawls, twirls and dashes her way through both traditional fare and original Christmas songs.<br />She shifts through styles, offering fans from all musical camps a gift of their own. Her &quot;Silent Night&quot; shows off a studied vocalization where liquid phrasing is key. &quot;Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)&quot; shows off a dynamic voice that is hard to match. She has fun with the Phil Spector goodie &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),&quot; a song straight outof '60s girl-group heaven. There is even a &quot;Joy To The World&quot; medley mixing the old and the new--the traditional Christmas song and the Three Dog Night hit. And, as usual, her gospel-voiced background singers are out in full force.<br />There are two ways to enjoy this album. One is to sit back and revel in Mariah Carey's vocal fireworks, and the other is to pour yourself a glass of egg-nog, get cozy by the tree and have yourself a MERRY CHRISTMAS.
0802130208|5.0|This has, hands down, got to be the most hilarious book I've ever read.  The way Kennedy has written it makes each scene of the book almost picturesque -- I have a REALLY good idea what all of the characters look like...<br />This is one book that is required reading for all of my friends.
B00005ASOC|2.0|A young black man from the Bronx who is a gifted writer and basketball player meets up with a legendary, reclusive author <BR>who becomes his mentor.  Sounds like an uplifting tale of triumph and sure-fire Oscar bait?  Think again.  This tedious drama plays out more like an elongated episode of &quot;Facts of Life&quot;.<BR>A real legend, Sean Connery, plays the reclusive author.  According to the story and for reasons not clear, he wrote a literary masterpiece several decades ago and then was never heard from again. He has spent the past few decades holed up in his apartment in the Bronx watching the world, and passing birds, with binoculars.  Down in the 'hood and playing ball within Connery's view,  is Jamal (Ron Brown), a soft spoken, mean-with-a-basketball, but highly literate ghetto boy.  Him and his homies speculate about the odd duck they see peering out and Jamal is dared into breaking into the apartment.  He runs out <BR>when Connery wakes up and leaves behind his backpack. Later, it's returned with the famed author having gone through with  <BR>tell tale red pen marks all of his notebooks critiquing his work.  A friendship is born and a protegee/master relationship is born.<BR>Meanwhile, Jamal's test scores have come in and the amazed administration at his local public school call a meeting with him,his mother and a staff member from an elite private school from Manhattan.  The elite school wants to offer Jamal an academic scholarship and &quot;wouldn't mind&quot; if he played ball for them as well.  Yes, the semester has already begun but they explain that they like to hold a few spots for prospective candidates while they wait for the mysterious test scores to surface.  He accepts and his next challenge is the school's stern literature teacher, played by the great F. Murray Abraham.  He is a no-nonesense type who is suspicious of Jamal's writing ability and sets out to prove his theory that his writing is not his own.  Oh, he also has a long-standing bone to pick with they genius writer, Connery's character, who he reveres and who sabotaged a publishing deal he had several years ago.<BR>Can you guess where this is going?  If you said a triumphant final act in which the good ghetto boy is exonerated and the mean Abraham character is put in his place, then you have the potential makings of a screenwriter.<BR>All of this comes from the great director, Gus Van Sant, who brought us the masterpiece &quot;To Die For&quot; and the fine &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;. (The less said about the &quot;Psycho&quot; remake, the better.) I can see a  roomful of film executive suits standing around and something like the following conversation was had:   You got Connery, a legend, Van Sant, he understand this touchy feely thing, Oscar winners F. Murray (Amadeus)and Anna (The Piano) Paquin, now that's class, and an unbilled cameo by a big star to boot!  Plus, it has a nice story about an a lovable old codger and an inner city ghetto boy.  We got all our demographic bases convered!   We got one here that should make waves at the box office and bring home those little gold statues. Wrong.  <BR>The film is surprisingly unengaging and plays out like a by-the-numbers movie of the week.  Rob Brown, in his film debut seems to sleepwalk through the role and is unengaging.  We learn very little about him and the audience is left very removed from his <BR>character.  This is a critical flaw.  F. Murray Abrahams character is strictly a one-note villain.  Anna is cute but has little to do.  This one should find it's audience on Lifetime.
0316776963|5.0|Okay, so I am on a fairly-long airplane ride, reading the 2nd half of this book.  I was laughing out-loud, to the point that when we landed, two women in the next two rows turned around and said, &quot;I'm sorry, but I just HAVE to know what you were reading....&quot;  The funny thing was, I didn't even realize I was laughing.<br />This book, and others by David Sedaris, are wonderful and hilarious and SO readable, all at once.  I strongly recommend anything that Sedaris has written, particularly this one, to anyone who needs to have one of those &quot;few and far between&quot; side-splitting laughs.
B00003CWRX|1.0|Boring, slow, and boring.  Even watching the actual 60 Minutes pieces on this story was more entertaining.

0062511408|5.0|I decided to buy this book because I had read so many good things about it and I wanted to know what was all the buzz about. As it said it was a fable, I thought it would be kind of a children type of book, nothing more far from the truth. This book is for people in search of a meaning in their lives. I had been through some hard times and was always asking myself, why? After reading this book I could proof the saying that &quot;everything happens for a reason&quot;. Coelho takes us on a journey through the exploration of destiny. He shows us that no matter what we have to face or how many problems we have, there will always be a way to get through it, we just have to have the will to do so... A great book to pass on to your children!
B00003CXTG|4.0|Ok i'll admit Pearl Harbor has it's Flaws the uninteresting and overly inflated love triangle between Rafe, Danny And Evelyn could of be deflated just a tad actually alot but that doesn't matter once the Attack begins thier is no more time for gushy love storys it's time to take a look on what Pandemonium it was like that Fateful sunday morning  and what a blow it was to america then after the pearl harbor sequence it's about the retallitory strike against Japan the bombing of Tokyo no matter what u've heard about Pearl Harbor don't listen to it it's somthing u have to see for your self just prepared with ur remote to fast forward through those gushy romance scenes
0060254920|5.0|I Love this book. It really captures the essence of daily adventure I had as a child and I continue to observe in children I encounter today.
B000002KHH|5.0|The dark masters of rock, the forefathers of modern metal; everyone who is anyone in the metal community owes this band, not to mention this album. In this their third offering, Sabbath really shows tremendous musical growth from Master of Reality and their self titled first album. And, if that was not enough, there is even a track for everyone on this album. For those who love to rock then you will bang your heads to paranoid and ironman. For those of you who just finished banging your head and would like some rest, then tune into the Planet Caravan and be transported elsewhere. And, for those of you who want to bang your heads again listen to War Pigs and see how your neck feels!<BR>THE GOOD: 1) CLASSIC ALBUM. Man, Sabbath really hit their stride here and created a masterpiece which could rank up their with Picasso and Rembrandt. This album fights Zeppelin for title of best album ever. 2) DARK METAL. This first band to ever do this, take Type-O Negative and mix it with some Slayer and you might come close to the evil that radiates from this album. 3) THE MUSIC ITSELF. Most of the modern bands have great guitar work, but lack in the lyrics catagorie. This album has it all, blistering work lead guitar, heavy bass lines, pounding drums, and excellent vocials. Hands down, this is the complete packedge.<BR>THE BAD: THERE IS NO BAD ABOUT THIS ALBUM.<br />THE BOTTOM LINE: There is no one else that can touch this band when they were at their peak which, suprisingly enough, was when OZZY was with them. If you do not own this album already slap yourself and then go out and spend your bucks on this one. This album is a &quot;must have&quot; for any collection, go and get it right now!
0385505833|1.0|A clever thought, poorly executed.  I would have preferred a different ending, rather than a traditional Christmas one that we find in &quot;It's a wonderful Life&quot; and &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;.  Maybe it would be considered black humor, then, but hey, why not go out on a limb and try something new?<br />I've read a few of John's books, great page turners, false drama created by not telling us who the &quot;evil&quot; person behind the story is. And then in one chapter, the person is exposed, and whammo, its over.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed those books and that's what counts!<br />This one, however, was just too stereotypical, predictable, and after a while downright tiresome.  I really enjoyed the first half of the book because it exposes the mass consumerism rampant during the holidays, something we all should reflect upon.<br />I say, read the first half, until their daughter calls from Florida, and then toss it.
0783244320|5.0|This is a great story about a crew of type cast, out of work actors from a Star Trek type TV show.  They are enlisted by a group of peacefull endangered aliens who don't have much of a stomach, or skill for fighting.  The cast of the show is quickly brought aboard a real version of their star ship and fight the evil warlord who is hunting down the aliens.<br /><br />I brought my 7 year old son to see this film when it hit the theatres.  He insisted on seeing it 4 times then and loved it each of them.  This is a film I thought would be as cheesy as Jungle2Jungle, but I was very wrong.  It's great!  First you have an amazing cast.  Tim Allen (jungle2Jungle, Home Improvement) is really on top of his game in this film.  Sigourney Weaver (Alien, Working Girl) looked great and showed a side of her rarely seen in her films. Alan Rickman (Die Hard, Harry Potter) does an incredibly convincing job as a Shaksperian actor turned cheesy TV show cast member who is forever type cast.  Tony Shalhoub (Wings, Stark Raving Mad) who is in my opinion one of the funniest guys around, does a great subtle role as a laid back Trekkie crew member.  Enrico Colantoni (just Shoot Me) amazed me as the alien, and Tommy Mithcel (Sgt. Bilko, 10 Things I Hate About You), who was great on John Larroquette brings his usualy talent.  But I have to say that it was  Sam Rockwell who provided the biggest laughs.  His portrayel of a star struck former extra on the show is flawless.  It's his character that really makes you think about all the cheesy ideas of a Star Trek type show.<br />Even though the this is one of the funniest films of the year, it's not really the humor that makes this a great film.  First, the effects are great, and if you're thinking of getting less than the DTS DVD, think again.  The sound is amazing on my DTS home system.  There is a great blend of action with the humor and it really moves the film along.  Second, this is a film with a very real messgae.  A scene where Tim Allen is channel surfing through countless gunfights and other violent scenes and ends up on his Star Trek type show makes you realize that all the Star Treks are a nice break from the typical TV line up.  It requires people to think, imagine and be creative.  How often does TV allow that?  Then there is the message of the show.  What was Star Trek really about?  Not laser fights and things blowing up, but a group of people exploring.  Loyalty, standing up for what you believe in, courage and honesty.  I'm not a huge Star Trek fan, I would rather watch Start Wars over any of the Star Trek films, and I have seen very few of the shows, but I do give them credit for having a message.  My son has watched this film so much that if it were a VHS, we would have need two replacements.  It's one of his favorites.  Just the other day his grandparents asked where he heard the phrase, &quot;Never give up, never surrender.&quot;<br />This is a great movie for the kids.  It's fast paced, funny and doesn't contain anything that most parents would object to.channel surfing through countless gunfights and other violent scenes and ends up on his Star Trek type show makes you realize that all the Star Treks are a nice break from the typical TV line up.

B000002NBY|5.0|Quite possibly one of the best albums of all time.  There is not a song on here that you could skip.  When it came out, it was the only thing like it around.  Graceland mixes Paul's phenomenal lyrics and music with the traditional stylings of the African singers.  It is a masterpiece.  Everyone should own this album.
B000000993|5.0|I picked up this CD because I liked the song Sober.  After a first listening, I was disappointed and disturbed by the rest of the CD and put it down for over a year.  When I came back to it and gave it another try, it really grew on me.  Many of my most favorite things are like this, disliked at first and then much better.  In particular, the song &quot;Prison Sex&quot; was too much for me at first and I hated it.  Once I got past the first level of the lyrics and understood what the song was really about, the cycle of abuse and how bad it is, I was able to appreciate it for what it was and now it is my favorite Tool song.
B000000U5F|5.0|Survivor followed their excellent 1984 release &quot;Vital Signs&quot; with the single &quot;Burning Heart&quot; from the &quot;Rocky IV&quot; soundtrack.  In 1986, &quot;When Seconds Count&quot; came out.  It kept the sound of &quot;Vital Signs&quot;, with a little more pronounced emphasis on keyboards.  But it didn't sustain the same momentum.  &quot;Is This Love&quot; did pretty well, but that was the only real hit from this album.  The musical landscape was changing, and a lot of the bands who had been really successful in the earlier part of the decade were having problems by now.  Most of the bands I really liked at that time were losing steam by 1986.<br />I got this on tape as soon as it came out, and I really enjoyed it.  It was a little mellower than &quot;Vital Signs&quot;, but it still had its rockin' moments.  I got the CD several years ago, and it has been in my regular rotation since.<br />If you like &quot;Vital Signs&quot;, then this is the closest CD to that sound.  They are very similar in style.  It doesn't have the hits that &quot;Vital Signs&quot; does, but the songs on here are every bit as good.  Their following CD, &quot;Too Hot To Sleep&quot;, really cranks up the guitars and is overall a much harder CD (and is my favorite).
B000005YZM|5.0|Haunting, beautiful and lovely. If you like sophisticated '60s pop, London and soft psychedelia you'll love this one. Put it on at bed time...nighty night!
B00003CXTG|4.0|This movie was not so much about the love story that all the trailers protrayed, but about the history of something that happened to our WONDERFUL country. The attack that happened on Dec 7th 1941 (Yes, almost 60 years ago) was something most generations growing up in todays socity have no visual clue about what really happened at Pearl Harbor. You do have look past the cheesy love story and pick-up on the wonderful bits of history in this wonderful movie.
0385505833|4.0|I read this book in the space of a day spent flying home after Thanksgiving.  It was pleasant and certainly amusing, with a few truly funny scenes.  A great book if you want a nice diversion for a little while.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This Britney Spears album called Britney really puts me in a great mood.  All these upbeat songs make me dance and put a smile on my face.  My two favorites are 'I'm A Slave 4 U, and 'Cinderella.'  'I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman' is beautiful.  I sort of like her version of 'I Love Rock 'n' Roll,' but I don't know why she had to remake that one.  Every track on here is great, and she has a pretty voice.  I recommend this album.
0064471837|5.0|Sariel is the best book I have ever read. It has and will be my all time favorite book. I could read it a million times and never get tired. Nix is a master of writing and keeps yoou hanging on the edge. I was hooked the moment I opened the cover. Have a great time reading it (trust me, you will want to)!
0780020693|5.0|What could one possibly say about this crazy, freewheeling, but reflective masterpiece of carnivalesque weirdness, dreamy locales, and brilliant comedic and dramatic timing. The best scenes are the grandfather doing the &quot;1, 2, 3&quot; after dinner, and the crazy uncle screaming out, &quot;I WANT A WOMAN!&quot; Fellini is incomprable and majestic. A numero uno man!
B00003CX5P|2.0|I'm just an average guy watching a movie.  And this is my opinion:  I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!<BR>The story wasn't interesting (or fulfilling).  There was no attachment or connection with any characters.  In some cases, they were just annoying: Jar Jar Binks.  They should have just cut this guy out completely.  The special effects were great but, again, this film relied too much on it.  I liked the older FX: animatronics and models.  The characters seemed more appealing and believable.  I hope they do a better job with the next film.
B00004U8P9|5.0|This has been a favorite of high school kids and college kids alike....or so I've been told. I first watched this movie when I was in boarding school and had the shock of my life when my housemaster burst into our TV room. Rather than being reprimanded for watching something a bit risque at a prep school, my housemaster astounded us all by singing along to Toucha Toucha Me!<br />The extra DVD is full of little quirks, behind the scenes, and video sequences guaranteed to satisfy all of us. It also comes with an audience participation sequence for those of us not willing to go out to the theatres without being properly prepared!<br />Let's do the Time Warp again!
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|The previews of this one were far better than the movie itself. Like most comedies, this would have made a great short film, say about 15-20 minutes. Instead of touching on several hit films like it should have, it re-does scene after scene from Scream until you forget that you're watching a comedy. There was one funny scene though: the preview for &quot;Amistad II&quot;. That was great! But the disapointments in this flick far out-weigh the good. For example, instead of re-wording famous lines like &quot;I see dead people&quot;, the characters just repeat them. What's funny about that? They should have said, &quot;I see white people&quot;, &quot;I see fat people&quot; and screamed. ANYTHING ELSE would have been funnier than just repeating the famous lines from movies. This is one of those movies that's fun to watch just to point out all of the scenes that could have been funnier. It has value in that sense and in the sense that it should inspire aspiring film-makers. If this can become a big hit, anything can! If you want to watch a real comedy from these guys, check out the far superior &quot;I'm Gonna Git You Sucka&quot;. It blows this turkey away.
B00004W52U|5.0|This is in my book the only punk band that can pull of ska tracks and not make them sound poppy ( ie Less Than Jake , Goldfinger ). The music is extremely intense and angry. The lyrics speak of the disllusionment in the punk rock scenes and the violence that surrounds them at shows or in every day life.<br />I don't even care for alot of ska , but this music is intense and loud without the poppy horns and what not. The opening track &quot;Knowledge&quot; has to be the best one on here , also &quot;Jaded&quot; , &quot;The Crowd&quot; , &quot;Vulnerbility&quot; , &quot;Hoboken&quot; , and &quot;Sleep Long&quot; are all my favorites. It's also great to hear the members of Rancid ( Tim &amp; Matt ) in their early years.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I seriously almost didn't buy Room for Squares after reading its Amazon.com review. Thank heavens I have a little bit of rebel in me, though, because it's seriously the best new music I've heard in a long, long time. Lyrically it's just stunning--I had forgotten that there's a whole silent generation out there just like me, stuck between gen X and gen Y, living transient lives that we're not entirely confident about. The music is pleasantly jazzy, and John Mayer's middle-of-the-road growl fits it perfectly. Rebel against stuffy old Amazon.com reviewers. Buy this CD. You'll be glad you did.
0930289528|5.0|What happens when a brutal and repressive government creates its own nemesis, then hides the evidence?  What if that nemesis learns and exploits each and every weakness of the rulers, at whatever personal cost?<br />&quot;V&quot; is one person, but this is really about the &quot;impossibile&quot; things that each and all of us can do, if we refuse to give up that last vital inch of our will.<br />This is nearly a perfect work, and still remains fresh and vital, even though the inherent timeline is a bit obsolete.  The art, the words, even seemingly small things like the absence of sound effect words... each image and phrase is precise and essential, and the story unfolds with the inevitability of falling dominoes (a central image in the story).<br />I think that &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; is particularly relevant right now, although the subject matter is a little difficult for these days- the main character is (by the definition of the facist government in the book) a terrorist, and he blows up a couple of buildings amongst other things... However, it is (in part) a magnificent cautionary tale about what happens to a society where people are too willing to sacrifice civil liberties for safety... the details are British, but the story is eternal.<br />Read it- and think.
B00004XONN|4.0|However, nothing really original as with OK Computer. Influences echo direct from Brian Eno and Aphex Twin. Good listen though.
6304712936|5.0|Occasionally there are Oscar winning films that actually deserve all the honors bestowed upon them.  Amadeus is one such movie.  It's based on a play - same name - by Peter Shafer who adapted a famous short story by Alexander Pushkin called Mozart and Salieri.  Accordingly, the movie follows the short story's premise that Salieri was implicated in Mozart's untimely death.  There were real specualtions to this effect but there was never any evidence and, if we are to believe Beethoven who was his student, Salieri was a very kind man.  Therefore the movie's story is fictional.  Nonetheless, many feautures of the story are based on fact. W.A. Mozart's relationaship with his father had been difficult as were his dealings with the powerful people who commissioned his work.  Moreover, Mozart's music was appreciated after his death.  Beethoven was really the firts great musical star or artist in the modern sense.  Salieri's music was popular during his lifetime but the movie does a good job of showing how unpopular it would become later when compared to Mozart.  The movie is also excellent at using the music, which is not merely background but is featured as a star.<br />Salieri's reminiscing of performance s and the cuts into the music are the movie's strongest technical feature.  But, visually the film also offers beautiful scenes from orgiastic parties with foods that made my mouth water to idyllic palace scenes - Schunbrunn Palce as Mozart performs his concerto no. 15 - to the utter pathos of the requiem composition and burial.<br />I have seen this film over 10 times and still can't get enough of it.
B00005LB9O|4.0|More of the same from the boys from Travis, and even sappier than before! But still a great album with some nice melodies and arrangements.
B00000BKDV|5.0|Maiden's fourth album became their first platinum platter in the U.S. which subsequently led to their first tour here as headliners. A significant reason for `Piece's' success was due to the collaborative effort of the songwriters, especially Bruce Dickinson. Stepping out of the shadow of chief songwriter, bassist, and band founder Steve Harris, Bruce showed a complexity in his ability to write powerful songs that lacked neither the poetic lyricism nor musical chops of Harris' best work. Case in point, \\"Revelations\\" is a masterpiece, Maiden's first true epic as a solo writing credit for Dickinson. Not to be outdone, Harris penned \\"The Trooper\\" arguably one of the greatest HM songs ever. If an alien arrived on earth and wanted to know what heavy metal was, this song would be all he'd need to hear. Smith and Murray's trademark harmonies create a foreboding back drop to Harris's adaptation of Tennyson's \\"Charge of the Light Brigade\\". Science fiction also gets its due in \\"To Tame a Land\\", Harris's tribute to \\"Dune\\" and another epic that closes the LP. \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", featuring the thundering drums of newcomer Nicko McBrain (completing the classic Maiden lineup) kicks off an album chock full of heavy highlights. \\"Flight of Icarus\\", the first single, and \\"Still Life\\" are excellent combinations of power and melody, metal with a commercial side, but not too blunted or poppy. Some filler with \\"Quest for Fire\\" and \\"Sun and Steel\\" being decent but unremarkable. The band was in top form for \\"Piece of Mind\\" and this 1983 release remains along with its predecessor \\"Number of the Beast\\" as the most important record in Maiden's formidable catalogue.
B00005A1PR|5.0|IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE HEARD A CD OF THIS QUALITY. EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS WONDERFUL, A TRUE TALENT, VERY SOULFUL.<BR>WELL WORTH THE MONEY, YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION...MICHELE MINARD
B00003CXXS|4.0|I feel like they there was a last half hour of the movie missing. The ending was fine, but they could have done so much more. The Spinosaurus kills the T-Rex in the beginning of the movie... They could've had a re-match with a different T-Rex... or two! Where's the Triceratops, and the spitting Dilophosaurus? There were so many more things they could've expanded upon (like that red carnivore that was hovering over the Spino poop), but they didn't. The movie was good, but come on - it only clocks in at an hour and a half. Is it really that hard to think if more, or was the film's budget really THAT low? Not that I love death, but not enough people died for the scenario to be completely believeable. If the kid died, albeit he was the best kid out of the trilogy, it would've brought a great sense of realism. I don't mind that Billy ends up living after disappearing in a cloud of Pteronadons - but they could've shown him getting saved, to add a few more minutes to the movie! And he could've been in a WEE bit more of a critical condition than those few scratches. Oh well, at least it outdoes The Lost World.
B000001FA4|5.0|This album will always have a special place in my heart. Yes, album--I bought it originally before CDs were around...yep, that's how old I am.  This is an amazing collection of music.  I won't go into a song-by-song breakdown.  All I can say is that this album is more ethereal sounding than any other by U2.  The Edge's guitar is haunting and piercing...this album is all about MOOD more than anything else.  This evokes in me the memory of driving out in the middle of nowhere for hours at night, through an inky darkness interspersed with the blinking lights of civilization lost in the infinite distance.  It is contemplative, dark, and somber at times, but also rises to joyful, pounding celebration in between keen, lonely moments.
0790731452|4.0|Mars Attacks is all about subtlety, as are many of Burton's movies. There are the obvious points, but the real pleasure comes from the self-realization.<br />The move points out time and time again that humans are so full of themselves we think we can predict everything. Case in point: in War of the World it was &quot;bacteria&quot; that killed off the aliens. How fortunate. Tim Burton shows us that it's equally possible, and 100 times funnier, to think that horrible Earth music can be just as deadly.<br />Those jabs appear every minute of the movie, and you have to pick them up to find it funny. Those looking for a more heavy-handed dose of humor may be disappointed. I got all the jokes, picked up all the satire and loved the movie.
B00005QCYD|5.0|Speaking for the average movie goer, I am not very fund of sequels but JP3 is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I love action packed movies and this one had it all. Bringing back Sam Neill also made this movie work for me. The Director kept me on the edge of my seat almost the entire movie. I enjoyed the ending eventhough it was a bit out there. I am anxiouly waiting for Dec. 11 so that I can purchase it on DVD and watch it at home.
B00004CWO8|5.0|I picked this up idly one afternoon at my school library, having once heard vague rumors about the all-male swan corps. Little did I suspect that I would be completely spellbound by the acuity and beauty of Matthew Bourne's direction and choreography and the imcomparable performance of Adam Cooper as the Swan. I was moved to tears at more than one moment during the ballet, and watched the swan sequences twice more that day alone. I'm praying that the show will somehow miraculously do another US run; till then, I'll keep watching.
0385505833|3.0|Although I enjoyed reading the book, however it did appear to me to be essentially an extended magazine fiction story and it did get kind of repititive at times.  Also, the Peruvian skin color thing was not needed in the story.  I'm not a PC fan but if something in the story is going to be politically incorrect at least weave it into the story some kind of way.  I could have understood if Mr. Krank was portrayed as an Archie Bunker-type or something.  Or at least clarify why the character may have something against their daughter's fiance's skin color.  There was nothing explained, it was just plopped in the book two times for no reason.<br />Nevertheless, this is a nice quick Christmas read.
0811826848|5.0|This book deserves 5 stars and is a must read for anyone interested in The Beatles. We can see how they evolved as people, as well as a band. We witness their weaknesses and their brotherly squabbling, the tragedy and success. It may be especially enjoyable for those who lived through that era, bringing back memory of the energy and spontaneity that spawned the hippies, the Apollo missions, James Bond, Peter Max, and many other great fragments of our culture. The pictures are fascinating and the inside stories about their personal perspectives are revealing. For those who did not live through the era, what we see today of these personalities is contrasted by what you will read in this book. If you ever liked The Beatles read this book!
B00005QZWI|5.0|One cannot imagine the intense disappointment spurred at the announcement of Howard Shore's helming this score.  Let's face the bare truth of his history: he's written TOLERABLE scores since he entered Hollywood, but never anything overwhelming, never anything irresistible to the film score fan, never anything to warrant the intense attention that some of the film industries more prominent composers deserve.  What Shore has done to this day has been appropriate, but never earth-shattering, never mandating score fanatics to flock to the scores for a work that, in all respects, is never ambitious enough to stand by its own.  Meanwhile, however, the talent was always there in the background.  One could sense the potential for a truly grand thematic quality lying behind some of his work; Silence of the Lambs come to mind very distinctly.  Unfortunately, until The Lord of the Rings he never fully grasped that potential and took it to the extent that could make him a frontrunner in the film score industry.  The Lord of the Rings, in short, shatters all preconceptions of Shore's talents and propels him to a new level of attention--deserved attention--that will no doubt classify him as one of the living greats.<br />First of all, on the subject of the themes, Shore exceeds even the prior example of excellence I had named.  There is an old-fashioned, medieval quality to their design that aptly coincides with Tolkien's universe.  First, one hears the playful, yet innocent Hobbit theme that is perhaps the best represented on the album.  Then, the Fellowship theme, which is short, but a brave, inspiring, heroic little piece of music that recurs just enough to be remembered, but never too much to become an annoyance.  Furthermore, among other minor themes, is Enya's contribution to the album, which certainly cannot be condemned but does indeed pale in comparison to Shore's offerings.  Altogether, Shore melds an album that takes into account the eventual three films in the seriesand never overdoes a theme, much as some other prominent composers are apt to do.<br />The two most thrilling aspects of this score coincide and can only be mentioned as cohesive compliments: the grand epic choral passages and the sheer size and power of the performers (instrumental and choral).  If a powerful chorus can in any way indicate the passion, intensity, skill, and attention that a composer instills in his work--and even if it isn't true, it still most certainly pertains to The Lord of the Rings--then Shore manages to command a distinct and undeniable love for this film that is sublimated through the truly spectacular music.  The large gothic choir is always magical, mysterious, and perfectly evokes the terror and grand landscape of middle earth by keeping a very tense, very dark character to the film.  Not, however, without its lighter moments, Shore walks the line that borders the very dark and serious adventure with the playful, jolly Hobbit race, more upbeat folk music that retains enough sobriety to maintain the blend of diverse tones.  What becomes perhaps most admirable is Shore's mastery of action music, which unlike most of his contemporaries, generally falls into brash and unlistenable cues that do little to be entertaining.  Shore however weaves a selection of action intensive tracks that nearly pass without the listener relating the sounds to what normally comes as a harsh, abrasive selection of rolling outbursts.  Shore, on the other hand, creates actual, honest-to-God music during the action cues--yes, in deed, it's near heard of, but what this does for the album (and no doubt the film as well) is to make the experience all the more perfect and to retain the cohesion of grand beauty rather than retreat to the familiar and detestable grounds that score fans are more familiar with.<br />And so from beautiful themes, to a massive awe-inspiring chorus, to a selection of music and tracks that are composed so well for the film that they translatenear astoundingly onto the album, a perfectly rounded CD is offered to the public that shows Shore's genius that may only now be dawning in the minds of film score fans.  This is the coming-out that any Shore fan has no doubt waited long to witness and can now proclaim and admire with unwavering admiration for a truly stupendous offering.  Yes, I had hoped for the likes of John Williams, David Arnold, maybe even (forgive me) James Horner, and I have no doubt that had they would have done well; they would have offered a respectable and not altogether different take on the series, though in all probability--and certainly to the detriment of the film--a lighter and less effective offering at that.  Instead, I was given something that is in all certainty nothing less than what The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien's superb vision, necessitates in its overwhelming and unrelenting design.  Shore, finally, has become the right man for the job--and now I anxiously wait to see what further projects of his will shock me in the future; I certainly know that he is capable!
0316286443|3.0|Aucoin produces yet another beautiful and fun book about the art of make up.  However, Face Forward is much like Making Faces without the practical techniques.  <br />The book follows the same format as Making Faces without many improvements.  The book begins with general articles about brows, lips, eyes, color, etc.  However, these articles are truly general and only give written directions to achieve the looks in the photos.  If you have the facial structures of the models, then these sections will be very useful to you!  For the rest of us, I found the preliminary sections to be fun but not helpful.  <br />The next section entitled &quot;Face to Face&quot; is useful with many before and after photos.  The techniques are written and illustrated by photos of the make-over subject throughout the process.  The looks are very natural and complimentary to the different ethnicities featured.  I wish there were more makeovers in this section!  <br />The final section entitled &quot;Dimensions&quot; features 48 different looks that are fun but not realistic for everyday use.  In fact, most of the techniques demonstrated would only be useful for Halloween or a costume party.  This section features many stars from Madonna to Tina Turner but offers little substantive content for everyday use.  <br />Being a make-up-a-holic, I found Making Faces the better buy of the two.  If you have to choose, choose Aucoin's first book for practical use.  For fun, this book definitely takes the cake.
B000002AHC|4.0|Not a great Byrds album, but a solid representation of the byrds in transition both musically and personel wise. This cd shows the turn to a more countrified- folk sound away from the 60's pop psychodelia sound. My preference is towards the country/folk/rock guitar Byrds era of Clarence White that included 'Sweethearts of the Rodeo', 'Untitled', 'Farther Along',etc. The Bonus tracks make this an album worth owning- the proverbial icing on the cake- with such gems as Bound to Fall (great instrumental), Triad, and alternative versions of Goin' Back and Draft Morning. Not there best, but damn good stuff.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Snow White, but my girlfriend is, and I bought this for her as a gift.  I have to say though, that the &quot;extra's&quot; on this DVD are outstanding!!  If you are a big fan of Snow White, then you will absolutely LOVE this DVD!!
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I must say when I first heard this album I was disappointed.  I didn't like the deep-voiced narration.  However, after a few run throughs, my sister and I, both Prince fans, love it.  I feel because Prince's music is forever changing it sometimes takes time to get into a new feeling because your used to another.  I have noticed similarities with other albums intertwined with this one.  I don't enjoy the beginning of Family Name.  I think it could be better.  This album is different but interesting in it's own way.  Prince, I know you like to do things different everytime and if that makes you happy then enjoy yourself.  To the many Prince fans out there if your not feeling this album immediately listen to it again and maybe again.  But I know that when I first listened to it, it was at the wrong place and the wrong time.  Try a different room or maybe in your car and trust me you can enjoy it.  Last December has a lot of similarities to Gold.  I love all the songs on the album.  I must say though if Prince always sings about God I won't get into it everytime, but if this is your form of Gospel it makes me want to listen.  I will always love his music.  Check out certain songs like Muse 2 the Pharaoh, Mellow, 1+1+1=3, Digital Garden, and She Loves Me 4 Me. They all have slammin beats and lyrics.  Prince, hun, you are a GENIUS!!!!
B00004RF8J|4.0|Alas, I'm without comparison to this.  I've never seen the original Roger Corman movie, nor have I seen the musical.  However, I have seen this film, and can say in confidence that it is twisted, sick, and fun.<br />First off, the music is in the style of rythmn and blues/broadway musical.  Whenever a song begins, three black background singers come out of nowhere and cop an attitude.  Beautiful!<br />The lines are laconic (my favorite:  &quot;I didn't kill him, I just chopped him up!&quot;)  The songs are... great!  sick! fun!  (Suddenly Seymour, Feed Me, and other hits)<br />The acting is... well, its acting you'd find in any tv comedy.. but it adds to the campy, over the top feel of the movie...<br />The plot:  Seymour makes it good.... but there's a price he's keeping from the world.<br />See it, believe it, become one with it... love  it!
B00003CXTF|5.0|Au contrare to what previous reviews may have said, I would like to say something: They are wrong!! Pearl Harbor is a very moving movie, Ask anyone. It is very informative of attacks on Pearl Harbor and is a very complicated love story. But without complications, it would have (been very bad) had it not have been acted and filmed the way it had. Though recent events have surely swayed people to buy this magnificent video, I do not think that the distributors have used September 11th attacks to promote Pearl Harbor. Still don't believe me? It's okay. The awards speak for themselves.
0767802659|5.0|While this movie does not follow Robert A Heinlein's plot exactly (or even closely)... it definately keeps Heinlein's attitude and overpowering xenophobia intact.  It has everything that Heinlein would have approved of.. big chested and beautiful women, open sexuality, violent and sadistic army officers, over the top verbage from its characters, demoralization and destruction of democracy, and last, but not least... an enemy we can all hate and loathe and not feel guilty about!   <br />This movie gets heavy rotation in my home because of all the above and the fantastic special effects.  Nobody who is a hard science ficton fan (and who has a strong stomach for blood and gore)should miss out on this film.<br />On top of that, this DVD has in it scenes cut from the movie, and other goodies that make this trip worthwhile.
0141301104|4.0|The Witches is the best book that I ever read in my whole life.
0385505833|4.0|If you are a Grisham fan looking for something a little different, don't switch authors, read this book.  It is a funny refresher from his legal thrillers.

0060900075|5.0|&quot;the doors of perception&quot; is an obscure little book by aldous huxley that, in my opinion, is one of his best. it is obvious that huxley is really reaching, however, and perhaps looking for metaphysical meaning where there really is none, although as a great man once said i am too skeptical to deny the possibility of anything. the beautiful and unique thing about this book is that you can practically feel huxley's passionate search for the underlying essence of the universe, and it is a real privilege to be allowed a peek into the mind of a man of genius in an altered and stimulated state. along with gerard de nerval's &quot;aurelia&quot;, this book is probably the best 'hallucinatory' work ever written. references to blake, coleridge, and many of the other 'mystical poets' abound, and one can practically feel the author's near desperation for attainment of ultimate truth. for a short time during the book he becomes what the surly schopenhauer would have called &quot;the free willless subject of knowledge&quot; and is more interested in the magic and wonder of pure perception than that of engaged being. huxley's honesty is at times almost disconcerting, and he admits several times that for people of abnormally abundant intellect such as himself, the world becomes more of a symbolic concept than a lived reality and experience, and his drug experimentation was an attempt to temporarily escape this mental deadening and sterility. it is probably true that this book may have helped to inspire some illicit and destructive drug use, but the blame for that hardly lies with huxley himself. if i remember correctly he published an essay that discouraged recreational drug use a few years after writing this book, although i could be thinking of someone else. there is no similarity whatsoever between a self controlled, brilliant man like huxley attempting a fleeting transformation of consciousness for creative purposes and a perpetually stoned young hippie trying to 'get the on the magic carpet ride' for a few hours. his more hasty readers should read a book entitled &quot;beyond the outsider&quot; by scholar/philosopher colin wilson before they start popping mescaline or taking psychedelic drugs that they are not experienced with. wilson describes in agonizing detail his horrific experience with mescaline and makes the astute and accurate observation that most people are too neurotic and fearful to have a positive experience with the drug. all of that said, however, this is an absolute must read for anyone even mildly interested in philosophy, poetry, or mysticism.the on the magic carpet ride' for a few hours. his more hasty readers should read a book entitled &quot;beyond the outsider&quot; by scholar/philosopher colin wilson before they start popping mescaline or taking psychedelic drugs that they are not experienced with. wilson describes in agonizing detail his horrific experience with mescaline and makes the astute and accurate observation that most people are too neurotic and fearful to have a positive experience with the drug. all of that said, however, this is an absolute must read for anyone even mildly interested in philosophy, poetry, or mysticism.

6303039456|5.0|WHEN I SAW THIS MOVIE WHILE SITTING IN THE WAITING ROOM OF MY ORTHODONTIST'S OFFICE, I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS THE 3RD BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, JUST AFTER CROCODILE DUNDEE AND HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS. MY FAVORITE PART WAS WHEN THE 4 JAMAICANS ARE SITTING IN THE BATH TUB PRETENDING TO RACE.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Good maximum effort and great special effects and pyrotechnics. But weak story. The movie was way too cliche and a no brainer. Everything from the train station farewell (how times did that appear in movies, a favorite among parodies) to Alec Baidwin making a speeches about the USA not losing the war because of men like Ben Affleck and Josh Hartlett. Very propagandic that is reminiscent of World War II-era Hollywood films. The Japanese sequences seemed to be done in a rush. And anyone noticed that Affleck didn't have trouble reading those love letters even though he was dyslexic?
B00003CXTG|4.0|THE ONLY THING THAT SLOWED THIS MODERN MASTERPIECE DOWN FROM BECOMING A CLASSIC. WAS THE USE OF THE LOVE TRIANGLE IT WORKED BUT.... IT JUST SLOWED THE STORY DOWN, WHEN EVER THE ATTACK DOES HAPPEN THE LOVE TRIANGLE JUST GOES TO THE BACKGROUND. AND THE ACTION STARTS HAPPENING, IN ONE OF THE MOST GRAND AND AWSEOME DISPLAYS OF MOVIE MAKING OF ALL TIME. AND I THINK THAT ANYBODY WHO LOVES DVD'S WILL LIKE THIS ONE, THE TRANSFER LOOKS GREAT AND HAS NO VISIBLE GRAIN THAT I COULD SEE, AUDIO IS THE GREASTEST I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME, BUT IT WAS A LITTLE WEAK IN THE CENTER CHANNEL, BUT I CAN LIVE WITH THAT. SO WHEN EVER YOU SEE THIS MOVIE OUT IN THE STORES OR ONLINE. BUY IT ,BUY IT ,BUY IT, BUY IT!
B00005Q66T|4.0|Well, every single review I have read here is interesting. Mostly everyone is disappointed at the lack of new material, at least 1 or 2 new songs here. I read in an ariticle that she is saving her new material for a new album which she is slated to start recording next year with Mirwais and company. The other songs mentioned like &quot;Ill Remember&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot; were on her &quot;Something to Remember&quot; compilation of ballads. To me it would be silly to put them on here again. Some argue that she put &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; and &quot;Drowned World&quot; on here. Just because they were not hits in the US, does not mean that they were not hits in other parts of the world. &quot;Take a Bow&quot; Was Number 1  in the US and charted poorly in the UK.  As for &quot;American Pie&quot;Thank God she did not put it on here..that song was awful and she admitted it in an interview that she did not want to record it, but was pressured to do so by Warner. I think Don McClean must have needed some extra money or something....<BR>I do agree that she should have placed an extra CD of remixes or the HOT remix of &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; or the &quot;GHV2&quot; Megamix that is only offered as a promo..(A deal expensive if you can get your hands on one)on here. But, the compliation does show Madonnas growth as an artist and an entertainer..from a broken divorcee who told us about &quot;Sex&quot;, to a quiet, introspective person, mother and wife. She does stay fresh and new and very much a &quot;Diva&quot; by all senses of the word. If you are a Madonna fan, you will buy it, as I have to add to your collection, but, if you are not, you may want to stick with your copy of the &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot;, and wait for her new album.
B00005R23X|4.0|THIS IS THE GREATEST TELLING OF THIS STORY EVER. I THINK THAT IT IS THE MOST EVIL AND HAUNTING MOVIE.

GO OUT AND BUY THIS DISC WHEN IT COMES OUT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.

B000002UYZ|4.0|...particularly in light of last year's release, &quot;1&quot;. That's a much better place to begin, if you are new to Beatle recordings.<BR>Its criminally short running time aside, the problem with &quot;1962-1966&quot; has always been its heavy reliance upon chart singles to document the group's early years. The absence of two of the group's best and most famous early numbers, &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; is particularly difficult to fathom. Listening just to this album, one might think the early Beatles were just a bouncy pop band who made occasional forays into elevator music and bleached bossa nova. You'd have no idea of the fury with which they could rip into a number like &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; or &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Music&quot;. Nor would you fully understand how inventive they were as songwriters, right from the start. Fortunately, on the second disc, some true flashes of brilliance begin to come through, but overall, &quot;The Beatles 1962-1966&quot; is just too narrow and too aggressively middle-of-the-road in its approach to be an effective document of the band in those years.
B00003CX5P|3.0|George Lucas should be horse-whipped! Yes, you heard me correctly. I,like zillions of fans,eagerly went to theater in the summer of'99 hoping for more of that old Star Wars magic. What I got instead was a cheesy, trite, in parts boring, in parts painfully annoying, 2 hour commercial. Sigh...I knew this movie was in trouble when, a half hour in a main character said \\"Exsqueeze me\\"..??? I think I grimaced and gasped when I heard this; Thats when I knew \\"The Force no longer with George is\\".<br />Now, let me just say that I had no overblown expectations of this movie..I just wanted a good movie that continued( or rather) initiated the star wars saga story. The only things I expected were the things that made me love the first star wars, charcter development, good plot, witty dialogue(that yes, was sometimes cheesy)but most of all, a basic respect for the story and the characters in it. I received none of these things. Simply put, Mr. Lucas took us for granted and got lazy on the script, expecting the audiences prior emotions for the past trilogy to 'carry them thru' this movie. Well, Im sorry George, but you have to work harder than that. You can't just throw out ill conceived barely developed characters, trite dialogue, threadbare plotlines and contrived battle sequences and expect me to hollah. Really George...what were you thinking??? George failed to make me give a darn about many of the characters in this story, no honest human emotion for me to identify with, nothing, nothing to get me engaged with the character. You would think that George would have worked extra hard at character development...esp considering that..err...WE ALREADY KNOW HOW THE STORY ENDS!!!!! ....with that fact in mind ,one would think you would work extra hard to make characters the audience can relate to and want to share the crazy wild ride with. But no..what do we get? Jar Jar Binks. Well I have one thing to say \\"Peeeeeee uuuuuuuu.....that smells stinkofish!\\"<br />Now..the reason I give theDVD 3 stars is well..b/c it was a good package..The extras are the real prize in this box set. Others have complained of the DVD transfer..but since I have a bad tv I dont really notice it so I give the optics a good rating. The sound is good too, but the gems are the extras ..the music video however is very bad..lifted right from the TPH video game(classy George)..and the visuals for the video are really crude. But overall, the extras are what make this dvd worth it.<br />Back to movie bashing. I hope, I really do, hope and pray that George takes some of this criticism to heart and goes back to the thinsg that made the first trilogy so great(namely...getting all those great wrtiers who worked on the first trilogy to write for him again) Visually, the movie was arresting, but not groundbreakingly stunning. I still feel more a sense of wonder and world-immersion from watching Star WArs than I do Menace...go figure?. So, I guess my point here George is , more plot, more characterization, lets CGI crud...The Cell proved..you can have all the smoke and mirrors in the world, (...)..-A.N.
B00005B36H|5.0|I've been reading some of these reviews and am disappointed to see people claiming their allegiance to Tool but claiming that this album is disappointing. Some say it's too progressive and different while others say that it's too much like Aenema. This is simply Tool evolving and those of you who fail to realize this should stop reading now.<br />The percussion as usual is a defining characteristic of Tool and is evident in Lateralus from &quot;The Grudge&quot;, with its numerous rhythms and oscillating pitches, to &quot;Triad&quot; with it's hammering patterns. Danny Carey doesn't have it easy though. In Lateralus he is constantly experimenting with different and unusual time signatures.<br />Maynard's voice is better than ever and probably better for his time in A Perfect Circle. He has an amazing ability to grow from a whisper to a shout, but unlike most &quot;rock&quot; bands now, he can do this and still sound good. Now, admittedly the 23 second scream in &quot;The Grudge&quot; is somewhat odd, but its well placed to contrast the prior dueling guitar and bass line. The lyrics, also written by Maynard, are bit more reflective and subtle than in prior albums.<br />Adam Jones and Justin Chancellor have their work cut out for them. Traditionally bands are strongest at their guitars and bass, this has been a convention since the beginning of rock. I can't honestly say that Jones or Chancellor are the greatest in whatever genre Tool's music resides in, but they have the same uniqueness to their playing styles as Maynard has for his voice. At times the guitar and bass present is almost an unfelt, but moving force. Suddenly like water flowing out of a broken dam, the two can rush forth and swallow up everything else. The guitar and bass lines will sometimes duel with each other and at other times will intertwine, either way both Jones and Chancellor hold their own.<br />The culmination of all this results in another great album from a band which is CONSTANTLY EVOLVING.They are heavily influenced by the prog rock bands of the 70s (i.e. Pink Floyd, King Crimson), but remain unique in a world of Limp Bizkits. Their sound is hard to identify to any one genre, and seems to take the best of everything into consideration.<br />(Good Songs: Parabol/Parabola, Lateralus, and The Patient)
0385335482|5.0|Scary as it was, I identified with this book; the shopping addiction, the rent being due, the debt, the love life, and trying to find another job.  Cannot wait for the next Shopaholic book to come out next year!
B00003CXTG|2.0|After hearing all the hype for this movie, I was extremely disappointed. They had a great opportunity to make an epic movie and squandered it. I'm sure there were enough real life stories at Pearl Harbor that day that would have been more interesting than the bogus love story they went with.
B00003CXTF|4.0|If Pearl Harbor has one great flaw, it is that it tries too hard to be the end-all epic - the war movie on the grandest scale. The first ninety minutes and the last, say, 20 minutes of the film are one more or less complete  being. It is an entirely passable, if a little cliched love story, which at its best can be downright touching. The brotherly dynamic between Hartnett and Affleck works well enough that the audience can believe the tension when everything falls apart. The intervening war scenes are visually stunning and well executed, but it seemed as if they were only rewards to the men in the audience who stuck through the love story. Because of this, the film can feel a bit disjointed, but the capable performances of Affleck and Beckinsale keep this from being just an \\"effects film\\". It never quite reaches the hights that it strives for, but for [crying out loud] it was better than Dude Where's My Car. Michael Bay is the Norman Rockwell of cinema. He should kiss his cinematographer on the lips.
1587990717|5.0|Taleb eplores of one of the least understood forces in all of our lives; mistaking luck for skill.       Here is a person with a single, but large topic, who spent his life exploring randomness vertically and horizontally, maturing it, getting into its most interesting wrinkles. The book is a feast to read and re-read. I laughed a lot while reading the book and had to think even more about Taleb's deep understanding of the philosophy of probability. He's amazingly articulated so you can see his damn brain working ... while Taleb can certainly not be accused of being humble :-)    Despite the hype for the book on Wall Street, FBR might very well be one of the smartest book of all time.
B00005214X|5.0|What a great album!  George really matured a lot since the wierd sitar tunes of the old Beatles days!  I love this album, though it makes me cry everytime I listen to it (especially #3)  because he died so tragically.... but I guess that's the way it goes, as George says, all things must pass...
B00004YRQA|5.0|I honestly don't understand what people are complaining about...maybe I just have the perfect assortment of games to not take up any space, but I truly have over fifteen different game files, and I still have a TON of space left; I estimate about sixty games or so more!  SIXTY MORE!!  That is unless all of a sudden games like Final Fantasy X, Silent Hill 2 and Dynasty Warriors 3 take up most of a megabyte each file; if all stays the same and well, then I still have a large library to gather up before I need to buy another one.<BR>I usually right long reviews, but with a memory card just prevents it.  Oh well.  Trust me, this thing holds A LOT!!  Not just 8,000,000 bytes of info, but dozens of complete files.  You could quite possibly be a serious gamer, and still only need one!  I am, and I do!!
B000050XEI|5.0|I absolutely love Enya!   And this one is even better than her last one...seems she just gets better and better.  I listen to this over and over again!  It's definitely one of the best CDs of the year and I think everyone should listen to it.  I love Enya and I hope she keeps making music for a long long time!
B00005Q45W|5.0|It's been a very long time since listening to an album for the first time made me cry. I buy a lot of CDs and while I am enriched by the variety I select I sometimes miss the intimacy of the way we got to know new records in high school when we could only afford to buy ONE once in a while. Ten New Songs immediately felt intimate. The first two songs alone are worth the price of the CD, and then it gets better.<BR>    Some customer reviews here have said &quot;we&quot; don't buy Leonard Cohen albums for the music. I disagree. And on this album in particular the moody and spare music perfectly complements and enhances Cohen's incredible rich, haunting, world-weary and ultimately compassionate delivery. The words are no more important than the spiritual energy the SOUND of this album puts forth.<BR>    I have loved Leonard Cohen's music since Songs From a Room, etc., in the late Sixties and while I appreciated his mid-period albums, his last couple have been a mixed bag. This album is exceptionally satisfying for its consistent quality, mood, and musical tone.

B00003CXTG|3.0|That the truth is always more interesting than fiction.  How true that statement is in regards to this movie.  This movie is entertaining but far from a classic.  When I watch it I get a feeling of a lost opportunity.  During that time there were so many interesting people and so many crucial decison made that I fell the movie would have been beter serve if they went the historical route. FDR is a interesting and charismatic person and the picture barley uses his character. Here is a man that was a four term president.  There has never been a president before or after that had that long of a term. If we had learn more about his decison and the attitude of the American people before Pearl Harbor it would given us a better sense on why Pearl Harbor happen.  Instead we had an emphass put on a romance.  That was OK for a while but they strech it to the limits. At the expence of screen time for some real life people who have had many books written about them because of the public interest.  I fell it a shame not to use them and to have brought them more to life with this movie.  I realize it a movie and not a documentry. But Peal Harbor,FDR and the attitude of the American people at that time were not boreing.  Why so much fiction when you have these people to help tell the story.  Take advantage of it; instead it takes a back seat to a love story that could have been use in a number of movie's.
0385505833|5.0|I absolutely love John Grisham! I loved his lawyer books and I like the way he's turning spiritual now.  And this one is even better than hislast one...seems he just gets better and better.  I read this in three days and loved it!

B00005Q45W|3.0|I found this album disappointing. It lacks the variety and creativity of 'I'm your Man' and 'The Future', and despite being only ten songs long, 'Ten New Songs' drags on. There are a few excellent songs. 'My Secret Life' and 'Love Itself' are incredibly beautiful, and make this album worth buying, just.<BR>It would be inaccurate to describe Cohen, on this album, to be singing. His voice is more of a gloomy whisper. Cohen's monotomous voice and Robinson's weak production make this album a huge let-down on his previous two. In future, Cohen should use a wider variety of producers. That is if he makes another album. He looks, and sounds, very old.
0872860175|4.0|&quot;Howl&quot; is perhaps the most aptly titled poem ever.  What Allen Ginsberg does with his poetry is exactly that: scream and howl and tear away at all notions of conformity.  The epitome of Beat Literature is it's uninhibited energy, of which Howl is a primal statement.  Ginsberg unleashes all demons, social to sexual, and leaves the reader with a sense of a man who is in tune with himself and his environment.  Gone are the rigid structures of verse and meter, instead they are replaced with a zest for life and a zest for the uncompromising truth.  Beat Generation writings thrive on the sound and the fury their literature contains, not bothering with too many pretentions and conventions.  <BR>As for comparisons, Howl follows in the tradition of Walt Whitman (who is given a strange but touching ode in Howl), with it's yelps and ecstatic screams.  Like Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, &quot;Howl&quot; expands the boundaries and concepts of what poetry is.
B000002BFZ|5.0|This is a version of Pearl Jam that you will not find on any albums.  Not on the big rock sound of Ten, the spaced out punk of Binaural, or even the alternative blast of Vitalogy.  No Code is the direct result of a band who holds themselves under no obligation to anybody or anything but the Muse.  This album contains music pure and true, unformulated and unconventional.  <BR>No Code leaves listeners with a sound that is more punk rock in terms of it's overt expressions of creativity, it's stripped sound, and it's songs decidedly uncommercial vibe.  Ranging everywhere from a tribal pulse (Who You Are, In My Tree) to hardcore blasts (Lukin, Habit), to soft acoustic lullabies (Off He Goes, Around the Bend), No Code refuses to conform to anyone's sense of what music should and should not be.  Instead, No Code says that music is whatever you hear, and whatever you create.  <BR>So don't buy this album expecting &quot;Alive&quot; or &quot;Not For You&quot; or &quot;Jeremy&quot;.  Instead, expect something totally fresh and real.  It's Pearl Jam garage rock!
B0000296SI|5.0|The recording engineers did as good a job as can be expected cleaning up this CD.  If you have kids and want to be able to listen to this album with them around, buy the clean version --  you won't miss a *(...)thing!  Oh, and I like the music.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Produced by the same team that made my favorite Armageddon, I was interested to see how the two would compare. It was a good movie on its own, but I felt it had too little to do with the war except that the people in the movie happened to be on the receiving end of the bombs. It reminded me of Titanic, with a better plot (both are love stories, Pearl gets a little more into the stuff outside of love). The initial parts are very entertaining, with humor sprinkled here and there, as it was in Armageddon, and is done just right to keep things interesting and not too serious. However, the end was rather weak. I won't spoil it for you; suffice it to say, it looked like the producer had no way to close off the movie, so it just ended. Some parts of the movie felt unnecessary (Cuba's role could have been left out and wouldn't have made a difference, in my opinion; he's just so disconnected from the other characters). Mr. Roosevelt... seemed rather inconsistent. He'd be a courageous leader in one, an impatient decision maker in another... wait, never mind, that's how politicians are. To close off my rant, the movie was something like a 3.5-star affair, but i always round up. I'm sure people will enjoy the movie, and I myself can watch it a couple of times more, but it's not something that i'd bring to a deserted island (those would be armageddon, gladiator... maybe even lion king).
B00001NFCY|5.0|This is a great album, and they people that have trashed it recently dont know what they are talking about. Every freakin song on here is a winner... Beautiful, Inside us all, With Arms Wide Open, Wrong Way... every single song! Go out and buy this album as soon as possible. Dont forget to get there new one, Weathered, whil you are out there... Its better than this - if thats possible...

B000002TQV|5.0|i was in (...) last night, (...) and they had this cd playing.  my friend and i didn't know who it was, but immediately loved it.  much to my surprise, this was radiohead, a band where i'm not really into their latest stuff.  i just wanna say, i wish i heard this back in '95 when it was releases b/c this is one of the best cd's i have ever listened to.  this is great alternative rock flavorful enough for poprock fans.  also recommend the new go go's (god bless the go go's) cd and the new remy zero cd (gold hum) if you like this album!

B000002B30|5.0|If you have never really taken on Bruce Springsteen, and if you have never really cared  to know the Boss, trust me, your mind will change by listening to his Greatest Hits.<br />  Strange, how the obvious collection of hits on this CD makes you fall in love with the man when you least expect to.<br />That experience is like seeing your next door neighbour all your life, and not really caring about his exixtence, but one day, you wake up, and you hear something about him that you've heard before, but suddenly, it sounds beautiful. It sounds unique because you hear it with other songs you know, but when you hear them collectivley, you realise htat they all stand out because they were created by a master.<br />  Then, you get involved deeply,and you start buying all his albums, because you can't live without Bruce.<br />  Springsteen's collection is a must have, simply because you hear the man in a way you've never heard him before. And when you hear him in his popular splendour, you can't wait to hear him in the rest of his untapped artistic magnanimity.<br />  That's when you budget money every week or month for every album the Boss ever made.
B000002KBA|4.0|First of all, I think that the cover of this album is pretty cool.  But the musical quality is even cooler.  While Purple might not have the entire Machine Head sound mapped out yet, they still play with raw, reckless, and amped-up aggression.  The addition of Ian Gillian on vocals for their previous album gave this band the much needed push into hard-hitting territory, which is exactly what this album is all about.  Blackmore's playing hasn't quite achieved Rainbow status yet, but it is almost unnoticeable among Jon Lord's speeding organ, Roger Glover's heavy bass, and Ian Paice's wild drumming. Don't expect any Lepplin-esque style or grace here; expect blugeoning hard rock.  From the raging opener &quot;Speed King&quot; to the tortured &quot;Child in Time&quot; to &quot;Bloodsucker&quot;, the entire album consists purely of burgeoning metallic fury.  Upon repeated listens, it is easy to see why this band was so influential in the hard rock and heavy metal genres of music.  Highly Recommended.
B00005AUBA|5.0|Do not listen to the nay-sayers.  This is the very best Mogwai album, period.  It is the most varied and most focused work they have done.  This allows the songs to garner an intensity that simply was not there before or was buried along with too much of the same.  From the swelling &quot;Sine Wave,&quot; to the hauntingly beautiful &quot;Take Me Someplace Nice,&quot; the mighty Mogwai will cause the hair on your neck to stand.  Plus the vocals here are so perfectly in place that you hope the band produces more vocal tracks in the future.  Personally I think this is the best album of 2001...anything that contains the ominous power of &quot;You Don't Know Jesus,&quot; has to be.  Please do yourself a favor and get this masterpiece.
B00000272N|4.0|This was the first grunge album I ever bought (on cassette, no less).  While Alice in Chains is not my favorite grunge band (Soungarden is), this album is still worthwhile for any metal fan.  It may lack the grand sweep of sweep of Dirt, but remember-this is only a debut album.<BR>Jerry Cantrell succeeds in creating a menacing metallic crunch in every guitar riff, while Layne Staley spews out smooth, atmospheric, and haunting vocal patterns.<BR>The first half of the album, which contains classics like We Die Young, Man in the Box, Bleed the Freak, and Sea of Sorrow, definitely outdoes the second half.  However, the strength of these songs alone constitutes buying the album, especially if you're a fan of the grunge scene.<BR>So  if you're even mildly interested in Alice in Chains, pick up the album-you won't be disappointed.

B00005QGAZ|4.0|Michael Jackson was the king of pop and not a tabloid freak or the but of late night comedy jokes regarding his appearance and/or perceived sexuality?<br />Well, good because this albumn is for us and us alone.<br />Here we revisit the early 1980's and his astronomical success both as a solo artist and one of the first icons of the then fledgling-then original MTV. No, this album is not a direct eqivalent to the civil rights movement of the 1960's, but it's mastering of then state of the art technology with a story in the video for the famous cover song was radical because it melded pop and rock together for a memorable sound that has been imitated but never duplicated.<br />Even today, I still like poping in this album because of the childhood memories it brings from memory lane. Sure the ecconomy was going to hell in a handbasket, we had the Challenger explosion, but the album reminds us to think and dream much further in search of awesome times than we ever believed we possibly could.<br />All of that said, I think Jackson's successive works have not been as successful and wish he would return to the formula represented in this albumn.
0425173895|5.0|This 1926 novel, Christie's masterpiece, is a justly celebrated tour de force of misdirection, with Christie walking a highly risky tightrope.  It is much to Christie's credit that she is able to play perfectly fair-or, as Poirot says, `Of facts, I keep nothing to myself.  But to everyone his own interpretation of them.'  Of course, this being an Agatha Christie-and her masterpiece-the reader's interpretation is certain to be wrong.  The solution is Christie' best known, and certainly her most ingenious, use of misdirection and playing on the reader's expectations.  As well as being ingenious, it is also emotionally disturbing in a particularly subtle way.<br />The plot is-apparently-quite standard.  The book is set in a small village, \\"King's Abbot, ... very much like any other village. Our big town is Cranchester, nine miles away.  We have a large railway station, a small post office, and two rival `General Stores'.  Able-bodied men are apt to leave the place early in life, but we are rich in unmarried ladies and retired military officers.  Our hobbies and recreations can be summed up in the one word, `gossip'.\\"  This is the first depiction of village life-complete with gossip grapevine-in Christie, something that would become central to the long and indifferent series of Miss Marple novels.  The squire, Roger Ackroyd, is stabbed to death in the study of his country house-although never stated as such, it is clear that the book is an effective parody of the generic detective story.  Hercule Poirot, now in retirement and growing vegetable marrows, but growing disillusioned-`Can you figure to yourself, monsieur, that a man may work towards a certain object, may labour and toil to attain a certain kind of leisure and occupation, and then find that, after all, he yearns for the old busy days, and the old occupations that he thought himself so glad to leave?'-is called upon to investigate the case, assisted by the narrator, Dr. Sheppard, \\"a man of middle age, a doctor,a man who knows the folly and the vanity of most things in this life of ours\\", who, it seems to Poirot, \\"must indeed have been sent from the good God to replace my friend Hastings.\\"<br />Poirot's statement that \\"everyone has something to hide\\" is borne out, as the little Belgian detective unravels a complicated strand of secret marriages, mysterious strangers, blackmail, and three village tragedies.  Poirot's detection relies on physical clues, for \\"a tongue is not enough.  [The walls] would have to have also eyes and ears.  But do not be too sure that these dead things are always dumb.  To me they speak sometimes-chairs, tables-they have their message!\\"  The clues are chosen with skill, and it would be impossible to improve upon the masterly juggling with times and alibis-relying on the now worn-out Dictaphone gambit (which is more convincing than in THE CANARY MURDER CASE of S.S. Van Dine, published a year later).<br />Finally, Christie does not neglect the humorous side of the story.  The tone is witty and malicious, and the characters vivid even for Christie: Miss Sheppard (a prototype for Miss Marple) and Mrs. Ackroyd are both genuinely funny, and the Mah Jong evening, where \\"a good deal of gossip is handed round at these evenings, sometimes seriously interfering with the game in progress\\", is a classic.<br />This, then, is one of Christie's masterpieces-if not THE masterpiece.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is not about Pearl Harbor. The attack on Pearl Harbor is in the movie but only after 2 hours of a love story that doesn't get shown in the ads. <br />This movie was made for little girls who want a Titanic romance type story.

0425170349|2.0|Rainbow Six is not one of Tom Clancy's better efforts. The reader is taken through an escalading series of contrived terrorist crises driven a most implausible antagonist. The book reads so much like a video game, that I was not the least bit surprised to see the video game on store shelves shortly thereafter. To me the book seems like an afterthought of the software development.<BR>My advice is buy the game (if that's your sort of thing) and skip to The Bear and the Dragon if you're a Clancy fan.

B000002J09|4.0|I decided to dip deep into the vaults and listen to some vintage rock and roll. After all, with the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" now available as a movie, the timing seemed correct.<br /><br />So I choose two bands, both of which peaked in popularity at about the same time, Led Zeppelin and the much lesser known Family-a band that should have given Led Zep a real run for its money.<br /><br />I found that the really rocking numbers on this CD, Black Dog, Rock and Roll, Misty Mountain Hop, and Four Sticks, hold up OK through the years, though these songs have not aged as well as some of the really rocking numbers by Family on albums such as \\"Song for Me\\" or \\"Anyway.\\" Plant delivers the goods, and it is clear to see why he was perhaps the second best male vocalist of this time though not the equal of Family's Roger Chapman, who clearly had more power and range and whom \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine called \\"arguably the greatest rock vocalist ever.\\"<br /><br />The Battle of Evermore sounds both fresh and haunting, in large measure because of the intertwined vocals of the late Sandy Denny. Jimmy Page's excellent guitar work here and on Going to California comes close to matching that of Family's guitarist Charlie Whitney on cuts such as Children from \\"Fearless\\" and My Friend the Sun from \\"Bandstand.\\"<br /><br />Stairway to Heaven, the monster rock song of all time, still holds up well. But if you have never heard The Weaver's Answer (on Family's second CD Entertainment) or Spanish Tide (on what I think is Family's best, Fearless), then you might want to check out these recordings. They sound fresh, partly because we have not heard them more than a million times and partly because they are the creative equal of Stairway to Heaven.<br /><br />No one can dispute that this recording holds a special place in the history of rock and roll. It's solid Led Zep with just the right refinements, plenty of heady guitar work, and a great rhythm section holding it all together. But does anyone over the age of 45 still keep this CD on the top of the current listening stack?<br /><br />I think a side-by-side comparison of Family and Led Zeppelin would turn more than a few heads and make folks realize that there is more to rock history than what gets played to death on the radio.s anyone over the age of 45 still keep this CD on the top of the current listening stack?  <br /> <br />I think a side-by-side comparison of Family and Led Zeppelin would turn more than a few heads and make folks realize that there is more to rock history than what gets played to death on the radio.  <br /> <br />
0671006932|5.0|I feel that this is an ageless classic.  One that a person can relate to no matter what the age is of the person and what the year is that this story is being read.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  I read it as a teenager and again as an adult and still felt as thought I could relate to the characters.
B000056V73|5.0|While some saw the sweetness and innocence of &quot;Almost Famous&quot; as a failure of artistic nerve, it is actually the key to understanding the allure of a movie whose remarkable achievement is the embodiment of the passions rock inspires in and draws from teenagers. The success of Crowe's movie is that rather than trying to 'deconstruct' or 'explore' (i.e., flatten and schematize) rock'n'roll or the 70's or fame or whatever, he recreates in cinematic form just what it was like, and probably always will be, for teenagers to listen to their music.<br />While the basic plot is a version of the truth--teenaged writer wins the jackpot of being assigned by Rolling Stone to cover a band (in the movie, a shaggy Midwestern quintet; in real life, Led Zeppelin), and missing school into the bargain--the clearly fictional elements are what set the film above pleasant but limited period pieces like &quot;Dazed and Confused.&quot; Of course the expected behind-the-music elements are here--the fights, the jealousies, the drugs (but not much), the often hilarious highs and lows of living fast and loose in the spotlight--and they are well done. Equally authentic are the scenes that show us the lost world and spirit of the 70's: the scene in which William's (the writer's) older sister forces her generation-gapped mother to sit and listen to Simon and Garfunkel's &quot;America&quot; by way of explaining why she feels stifled at home is priceless. But the center of the film is the love triangle Crowe develops between the likeable young protagonist, the band's talented and (of course) egotistical lead guitarist, and the young groupie who is doomed to love the man and his music but actually has more in common--integrity--with the sweet but desperately uncool boy. The fantasy who makes the film come alive and gives it its rich core is the luminous Kate Hudson, as the flaky but ultimately human and transcendant girlfriend Penny Lane, who becomes a living metaphor for William's--and our--relationship with rock music.<br />Penny is a young man's dream of a groupie: sexy and sweet, knowing and goofy, smart and child-like. Of course young William falls hard for her, almost from the moment they meet, and of course she falls hard for the semi-married lead guitarist and true talent of the band. Billy Crudup plays the handsome Darryl, who can hardly be blamed if he goes along with Penny's winsome beauty and no-strings-attached love and adulation and who never, really, ever promised her anything more, much as he might want it himself. He's a rock star, after all, with an ironclad dispensation--granted by the fans themselves, including Penny--from responsibility. How could any of them help themselves, living as the do in a world whose first commandment is 'follow your heart'? But as the relationships grow tortured, as the betrayals mount, as the carnivalesque world of rock 'n' roll gradually reveals that the other side of having anything you want is not having it for long, the answer becomes: Who can win in such a situation?<br />The chains of never-satisifed longing between the three, the ecstatic peaks and heart-breaking losses, come to be the emotional figures for the ideals, inspired by the music they adore, that the young embroider out of hope and desire and innocence and use to adorn the objects of their desire. This is the real heart of the film; the whole mess can only be called love. In this way Crowe foregoes 'commentary' for real insight, and gives us the splendid gift of taking us back to when we loved music like we breathed air. 'Almost Famous' goes beyond the rich soil of low comedy comprised of youthful missteps and naïve boners, of predictable rebellion and cliched coolness, and reminds us instead that it is love that young people feel for their music and their musicians. And for the possiblities and freedoms the music promises and instantiates, and that that love is as real and powerful as anyone's.<br />The film reminds us that music isyoung people's secret passion, hidden from parents and the 'real world' Penny continually mocks, only occasionally capable of being shared even with other music-lovers, because it is so deeply personal. This is a strong love that is at once perfect, sublime and desperately unrequited. When William's older sister bequeaths him her secret stash of rock albums as she runs away from home (away from her formidable and fabulous mother, played by Frances McDormand), she is giving him the keys to the kingdom of art and passion and beauty, miraculously immortalized in cheap vinyl. But the albums are, as her own flight shows, apt to awaken urges they cannot satisfy. The adoration that millions of us felt for John and Paul, Mick and Keith, Bob and Jimi and Janis and all the rest is played out, doubled and mirrored in the teenagers' twinned and ultimately hopeless passions. Penny is as foolish and reckless, and as lovely and eternally young, as the passions of William and all of us for the music that speaks only to us as teenagers--hidden away in bedrooms and dens, driving around aimlessly in suffocating towns and hellish burgs that feel like the edge of nowhere. Like her, the music gave us the strength, the faith, to go on, and showed us what we wanted out of life, at a time when not knowing seemed the cruelest joke we could possibly endure. Penny is the solace and promise of the perfect smile, musical and playful and knowing, suite Judy Blue Eyes herself, on a plane beyond pressure and expectation, beyond time and decay and ultimately, painfully, beyond sharing, the irreducible substance without which the soul cannot tell what it most wants to be.<br />Or, to put it another way: &quot;Well I saw her face/ now I'm a believer.&quot;is young people's secret passion, hidden from parents and the 'real world' Penny continually mocks, only occasionally capable of being shared even with other music-lovers, because it is so deeply personal.

B00005R2M3|3.0|Shakira's &quot;Laundry Service&quot; is a great album that showcases the singer/songwriter's unique voice and style.  However, as many of the reviewers have already stated, the magic of her songs in Spanish gets lost in her English lyrics.  I guess it is hard to like more the English version of &quot;Objection&quot; when the Spanish one has such great similes such as &quot;you left me like the Mona Lisa, with no tears yet no smile&quot; and &quot;i'm vaccinated against your abuses&quot;.  We can only look forward to greater development of her songwriting abilities in English!  <br />Highlights of the album include all the Spanish songs, Fool, and Underneath your Clothes,

Yes, his Wildcard! And it must be said: this one earns his variable worth! Starting with the soft sung lines &quot;Fundamentally sound, my karma's coming round, and I'm not worried&quot;, going over with power into the next, let you hear right from the start that he really has nothing to be worried about indeed! <br />His voice is stronger then ever and reaches 5 octaves (!).<BR>Not only his voice is flexible, so are his songs.<BR>From the range of Pop: like &quot;O Divina&quot;, &quot;Ev'rythang&quot; &amp; &quot;Sayin' about you&quot;, to the sound of the 70's like &quot;Designated Fool&quot; with heavy wah-wah's and electronics and &quot;Drivin' me crazy&quot;, Rockin' with &quot;SRR 636*&quot;, &quot;...and they will never know&quot; &amp; &quot;The Inner Scream&quot; and then his R&amp;B and Soul flavored ballads &quot;Love can you hear me?&quot; &amp; &quot;Sweetness&quot; to a Jazzy &quot;Shalom&quot;.<br />&quot;Shadows&quot; could perfectly fit as the soundtrack for the next top-winning Oscar Movie!<br />All the creative ranges in his voice, music and lyrics, makes this album his best ever! I leave the rest of the songs unspoken 'cause they speak very well for themselves and I wish you the enjoyment of the surprise-elements!<BR>In the past he might have played some games of bluff-poker, with his Wildcard he absolutely overrules anyones Full House! <br />Btw: this is the &quot;European&quot; version, if you want to have/hear the extra bonus track &quot;Testify&quot;, then I suggest you to get the Japanese import!

0573016399|4.0|The film &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot; was one of my favorite movies of the 1980's. I bought the novel upon which the film is based, even though I don't like reading a book AFTER I've seen the movie. (The fact that I bought the book after viewing the movie is a testament to how much I loved the movie.)<br />Somehow, even though I've tried more than a dozen times since the theatrical release of the movie, I have never been able to get into the epistolary novel (written by a French writer named Choderlos de Laclos) upon which the film is based.<br />Just recently, it dawned on me that &quot;LLD&quot; had been a stage play, and so I got the play and read it.  I liked it -- a lot.  If you're sometimes cynically romantic, and other times, romantically cynical, but always somewhat romantic, and somewhat cynical, then this play is for you.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|How this album can not be the number one 80's album of all time is beyond me.  I am not a huge DD fan per se, some of their stuff was awful, but for its time this was as good as it gets.  Definitely representative of the 80s genre.

En fin, nunca pens que a mis 29 aos de edad podra existir un album completo que pudiera compararse en el impacto personal que tuvieron en m los clsicos de todas esas bandas, sumando a Marillion, Yes, Supertramp, Pink Floyd, etc. Sin embargo este Cd es TOTAL Y ABSOLUTAMENTE EXTRAORDINARIO...DT deberan cerrar la puerta y apagar la luz, porque va a ser realmente difcil hacer algo que no quede disminudo por la grandeza de este trabajo. Aunque es innegable la fuerte influencia de todas las bandas supracitadas, sobre todo Floyd, la msica es tan inventiva como emocionante, las melodas son tan pegajosas, a pesar de que hablamos de metal progresivo...

B000001F9N|4.0|We've got here terrific Donna Summer material. <br />I admit Donna drags her voice on &quot;Come With Me&quot;, yet every other aspect of this song's music more then makes up for this drawback.<BR>The first time I heard this song, I knew it's one of my favorites of all songs after hearing only 2 seconds!!! This track is almost the epitomy of magic - even more so the last 50 seconds!            In &quot;Try Me...&quot;, some portions are annoying but they are eclipsed by the other portions.               The last two minutes of &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot; are too repetitous and boring.<br />All things considered, I strongly recommend this album to any serious disco fan striving to find music of value. Bottom line: every track on this album deserves a big round of applause.
0385484518|5.0|In our ESL Class in Brooklyn, NY, we read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\". This book is about one student. His name is Mitch and he lost contact with his favorite professor Morrie, for sixteen years.<br />One night when Mitch was watching TV, he saw his old professor teaching his own death in Ted Koppel's program \\"Nightline\\". Since that Mitch visited his professor every Tuesday....<br />This is an unforgettable story about the most important things in life: compassion, love and forgiveness.<br />I have never read a book like this. It moved me to tears, and it made me reflect on my life, to think what I'm doing wrong.<br />We saw the movie too, and when my teacher told us \\"bring a box of tissues\\", I didn't believe her, and it was true, we needed it.<br />I bought this book to send it to my brother in Mexico, because he is a teacher.<br />If you would like to read this book, I recommend it. I'm very sure that you are going to enjoy it.<br />I love Morrie's Aphorisms: \\"Devote yourself to loving others\\", \\"Love always wins\\" and \\"Learn to pay attention to others\\".<br />Rest in peace Morrie Schwartz. Thank you Mitch Albom for this inspirational, delightful and sensitive book. It's wonderful.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|I am a big fan of CG-films, and I admire the leaps that each new one makes over the previous ones, but this film just didn't cut it for me.  I know I may be going over some people's heads here, but the walk cycles on some of the characters were just annoyingly dull.  I expected creativity to be dripping from this film, oozing out of the celluloid, but it just felt uninspired.<br />The plot was pretty much warmed over fairy tale with an anti-Disney stripe (which apparently appeals to many people, but not this reviewer) and the animation really didn't blow my mind the way I expected it to.  The fart and &quot;pee-pee poo-poo&quot; jokes got old VERY quickly, and when you strip away all that, all you're left with some fairly impressive voice talent.  The problem is, the actors really didn't get to do much.  Cameron Diaz pretty much reprised her &quot;Something About Mary&quot; performance, Eddie Murphy brought out his &quot;Mushu&quot; characterization from &quot;Mulan,&quot; John Lithgow played a short Dick Solomon from &quot;Third Rock from the Sun&quot; and Mike Myers phoned in with an extended &quot;Fat Bastard&quot; schtick from Austin Powers 2.  What's more, I swear all four of these actors' voices were tinkered with in the computer, and the sound just didn't quite work.<br />I know this is a lot of nitpicking, but I walked out of this movie feeling COMPLETELY underwhelmed and wanting my $8 back.  If shoddy craftsmanship, lack of a decent storyline, an overabundance of fart jokes, and a half-hearted attempt at computer animation don't bother you, by all means, watch this movie.  If you're holding out for something better, go watch Toy Story 2 or Monsters Inc. or something that reflects the effort and craftsmanship that went into it.
0684853523|5.0|I am not a Stephen King fan. Well, I didn't use to be. I don't know what inspired me to buy this other than that I'm a fiction writer myself. It was a surprising treat! I couldn't put the book down, and in fact as soon as I was done I went out and bought one of King's novels ('Insomnia', since I'm not really into horror).<br />The first part of the book is mainly biographical. I had no idea that King had been so incredibly destitute before selling his first novel. It is funny as hell and very inspirational to read where King started and how he got to where he is today.<br />The second half is where he becomes a teacher, trying to coax creativity and motivation from the reader. I daresay it works. He has an exercise in the book to demonstrate how he deals with plot and situations - I immediately sat in front of my computer with his scenario and was off writing. About 45 minutes later I had a complete story, start to finish, that was actually kind of decent!<br />This book won't teach you how to write, and it won't make a published author out of a sow's ear. But if you like to write but need a bit of a kick in the pants, this is a good book to read. You'll enjoy it, and if you're not too stubborn you might actually want to do some new writing upon finishing it.
B00005RFAI|5.0|She is most definately a superstar. Especially when she is hanging out with Steven Tyler. Good move P!nk! I can totally see them singing Misery on some awards show. Her first single Get this party started, was a good choice, catchy, just ask the Billboard awards. They used it for every entry and exit to and from commercials. If you didn't like it before, you definately like it now. She is gonna be HUGE. nuff said!!
0823003035|5.0|Although I wouldn't recommend Ryder's book to be the very first instruction book to use if you're just beginning to learn to draw, it definitely should be the second one.  (If you're just starting to learn to draw realistically, I would recommend beginning with a book like Edwards' &quot;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,&quot; which, despite flaws, can give you faster results and motivate you to keep drawing.)  Ryder doesn't say much more than the bare essentials about nuts-and-bolts technical matters (like what sort of pencils to use, etc.), but rather concentrates on describing a general approach to drawing- how to look at your model and transfer what you see to the paper.  He does this with an economy of style that can get dense at times, but at the same time he avoids talking down to you or trying to make good drawing seem easier than it is.  As he repeatedly emphasizes, it can take many hours of persistence and re-working to make a good drawing (or even a mediocre one if you're a beginner), and in fact it is that persistence- rather than some special ability- that makes it possible to draw well.  Too many &quot;teach yourself to draw&quot; books aim you toward producing cartoonish or soft-focus drawings like you can buy from that guy with a portrait booth in the mall.  The excellence of Ryder's drawings- which, as other reviewers have noted, are worth the price of the book by themselves- show that he probably has more important things to say and higher goals than most authors of art instruction books.  Even if you don't understand everything right away, this books rewards re-reading as you progress and get a better hand-on sense the issues and techniques of drawing that Ryder talks about.
B00003CXQX|5.0|My whole family loves this newer edition to the family of Disney.  We are constantly quoting the movie and laugh out loud everytime we see it.  Believe me the tape is wearing thin!  My husband and I have watched it many, many times and still enjoy it.  The characters are lovable and the villaness is not only mean (not scary) but hillareous.  One of Disney's finest in a long time.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is cool, a good combo of reality and fiction/fantasy.  I think that most people would agree this is a good movie!
B0000048V8|5.0|A beautiful, magical stroy of a little boy's adventure with a snowman that comes to life for one night. Gorgeously illustrated and scored. It should be in every family's collection. My little boy's favorite from age 10 months on!

B000002KAT|5.0|This is probably my favorite album of all time.  I've listened to it countless times, and it never gets old.  Those other reviewers who don't \\"get it\\" make a few valid points:<br />1) It isn't perfectly played.<BR>2) The songs aren't polished.<BR>3) It isn't Van's strongest collection of songs.<br />First of all, it isn't necessary for great music to be note-perfect.  ASTRAL WEEKS is about the magic of improvisation-- the suspended thrill of playing (and listening) on the cusp of discovery.  In that way, the album is a perfect marriage of music and lyrics, as Van bends and twists the language in an effort to TRANSCEND the earthly significance of his words, to conjure a piece of heaven out of the frustration and pain that wracks his existence.  Like Ray Charles did 15 years prior, Van fuses gospel and blues, the sacred and the profane.<br />For those of you hear only hippy-dippy (...), you're obviously missing the unbearable heartache that haunts these songs.  Cypress Avenue deals with unrequited, perhaps forbidden love.  Madame George captures the mixture of joy and sadness that comes with lost innocence, getting on &quot;the train&quot; that takes one away from a place of safety and comfort.  Ballerina is a burst of effusive passion, but the object of the singer's affection is separate from him, a spectral fantasy that he can only gaze on with paralyzed amazement.  Thank god these rough gems weren't polished for radio consumption-- their unique, spontaneous quality would have been ruined.<br />I concede that this isn't Van's strongest collection of songs, but it's hard to think of these tracks as &quot;songs&quot; in the conventional sense-- impressionistic sketches, maybe, but they hardly lose any artistic merit because of that.  ASTRAL WEEKS is not a jazz album, but it certainly brandishes a jazz mentality-- the triumph of feel over form, emotional release over craftsmanship.  If that's not your cup of tea, then proceed directly to MOONDANCE.  But if you're searching for a true musical journey-- in the truest sense of the word-- then ASTRAL WEEKS is the apogee.
B000006O7C|5.0|A fitting elegy. Sprawling, headstrong and completely beautiful. The first disc is an exceptional album that, amazingly, Buckley planned to dump. I really can't imagine not being able to hear and sing along to Opened Once (possibly the sweetest, saddest song I've heard) and Morning Theft (the second sweetest, saddest?). This disc is Jeff Buckley crystallized. A stomping Ths Sky Is A Landfill; the so-comfortably retro Witches Rave.<BR>The second disc is something you have to hear for yourself, sorry. The best terms to describe it are: a)frightening, b)awesome and c)highly inspirational. Murder Suicide... is what Thom Yorke was grasping for in Kid A's heartfelt best. <BR>Amazing. Singular.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Diana has made an immense contribution in reviving great chestnuts from yesteryear,some famous, some not,and bringing a whole &quot;new&quot; kind of song to a huge new audience of those who long ago said &quot;enough already&quot; to top 40 pop,and who almost gave up on anything current. She deserves oceans of gratitude too. In this effort,she shows she can compete with the best,and in doing so even turns in very fine new twists on these tunes. The mellow bossa nova flair in &quot;Let's Face the Music&quot;,and &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot; give new life to some never tired greats. The snappy small group pieces here are all outstanding too.But for me,the real winners are three I admit I had never heard before.These are the ballads WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES,I'LL STRING ALONG WITH YOU,AND my personal favorite WHY SHOULD I CARE?. On first hearing these,I was truly swept away by the dusky sincerity she projects,plus the lush Mandel charts.These three will be among my all-time favorites,ranking rate up there with even Sinatra's best ballads,which is very high indeed. It will be difficult for Diana,or anyone for that matter,to top the sounds on this album,but I hope she tries!!
B00000I8UK|1.0|This is the kind of music that has contributed to the slow death of jazz as a mainstream American artform. It is grating, disheveled, irritating music (and I use the term &quot;music&quot; with great reservation) that will send the sensitive listener running to turn down the volume on his / her stereo.The disturbing nature of this recording is tailor made for the elitist pseudo-snobs out there who insist that there is actually something redeeming to be enjoyed in this type of jazz. Absolutely awful.
0385505833|1.0|If you are expecting the depth of character and story line of a typical John Grisham novel, you are going to be sadly mistaken.  This is an absolutely inane book based on petty, self-absorbed, small-minded characters in a ridiculously overbearing neighborhood.  This book is far from funny, if that's what it's supposed to be.  I couldn't force myself to even finish this extremely small (in many ways) book.  Save your money and buy yourself something else for Christmas.
B000005HLV|5.0|If you're looking for some church-burning, pig-decapitating, 300+ beat per minute Satanic Black Metal, look no further.  By the time this album was released, only the drummer, Hellhammer, remained.  Their original singer (fittingly named &quot;Dead&quot;) killed himself and the guitar player, Euronymous, was killed by their bass player.  But enough about the legend - the music on this disc speaks for itself.  The drums sound like a drum machine with the speed knob turned all the way up and broken off.  The guitar parts are relatively simple, minor progressions that create an eerie mood.  The vocals sound like a guy being strangled, spewing out venom and hate.  The bass is a bit quiet, which may be because the drummer had to re-record them after the original bassist was sent to prison for murdering their guitar player!  Talk about a band break-up!  If you like more abrasive, classical-sounding Black Metal, check out Ulver's &quot;Nattens Madrigal&quot;; and if you like more majestic, Viking-style metal check out Enslaved's &quot;Mardraum&quot;.  NOT for the mall-going Cradle of Filth poster buying poser!  This is for real.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Well first of all this movie might not have had 5 star credits but thats only because they dont know good movies. Lets think about this, it made me laugh, cry and it had two incredible hot guys!! How could you not love it even if it is just for Ben and JOSH!!! Well the story was good and not just concentrated on teh war about the times around it. I thought it was well written acted and the special effects were great!!
B000002G87|5.0|This is simply a wonderful album.EVERY SINGLE track is good.Eric and Duane playing together is wonderful.They both brought out the best in each other.For those wondering who plays what on the album,here's the tracks Duane played on:<BR>Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out (slide)<BR>I Am Yours (slide)<BR>Anyday (slide)<BR>Key To The Highway (slide)<BR>Tell The Truth (slide)<BR>Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad (lead)<BR>Have You Ever Loved A Woman (slide)<BR>Little Wing<BR>It's Too Late<BR>Layla (lead and slide)<BR>Thorn Tree In The Garden (slide)<br />For those who thought that Duane simply played all the slide parts and Eric all the leads,that is incorrect.On nearly every number that Duane played slide,Eric also plays slide.Also,that is Duane playing the famous 12 note intro on &quot;Layla&quot;,not Eric.<br />For those wishing for a Derek&amp;The Dominos reunion,it is impossible.Duane Allman died in 1971,Carl Radle died in the late 1970s,and Jim Gordon is serving a life sentence in prision for killing his mother in the early 1980s.The only remaining members of D&amp;D that aren't dead or incarcerated are Clapton and Bobby Whitlock.<br />Other suggested albums-Derek&amp;The Dominos Live At The Fillmore (less Duane);George Harrison's All Things Must Pass,which features D&amp;D as George's backup band.<br />If you are an Eric Clapton or Duane Allman fan do not own Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs,you need to buy this album.It is both these artists' at their best as musicians.IMO this album is amoung the most over looked in music history.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I've read a lot of the negative reviews around and on this site, and I actually agree with a lot of the criticism.  I'm very indifferent to homosexuality so that whole subplot didn't really bother me although I can definitely see how it could annoy.  I thought the paper bag scene was pretty lame too, actually.  The ending would have been better had they not changed it.  But I still liked the movie a lot anyway.<br />I had a lot of fun watching Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, waking up from his slumber of a life as a beta-male, turning around and living life the way he wants.  It's funny and somewhat inspiring.  I really connected with his character and his whole obsession with the 17 year old Angela.  Who cares that she is much younger than him?  She is one year away from being Playboy-model age and people are talking about comparing him to a pedophile?  Get a grip.  <br />Anyways it was a good movie, maybe a bit political but I enjoyed it anyway.  Worth a rental at least.
0385484518|5.0|I think that there is a point in our lives that we forget one important thing in life, That is love. We  also forget to give thanks to those who mean a lot in our lives. Mitch is so busy with his work that he forgets about love. One day he reunites with his old professor. Morrie helps him to remember and also teaches us to analyze our lives and give our lives a second chance. I recommend this book for those who need a little inspiration, or guide in their lives.

0060392886|5.0|I was never a fan of Motley Crue, what with their foo-foo hair, cheesy makeup and inane songs, but you just knew that they were  the biggest rock pigs on the planet. This book proves it. Drugs, groupies, sex, more drugs, Ossie Osbourne, more drugs.<BR>Man, if the upcoming Gene Simmons autobiography is half as good it'll be great. But somehow I think Gene's will be more of the same old bloated ramblings he's been indulging in for years. Time will tell.<BR>In the meantime, get this book, it's a real page-turner. Even if you do feel like taking a shower after every few pages.
B00005NB0H|5.0|Even if you have the earlier 1995 remaster of this concert, you need to get this one. It is without question the greatest concert album ever. Don't know why the entire Tommy was left off the original or '95 versions, but it is simply amazing to hear the entire rock opera live from start to finish. &quot;Sparks&quot; alone is worth buying the cd. And the first disc which is mostly the '95 remaster is unbelievable in it's own right. There was never a greater live act than the Who, and this is the best recording of them in action I have ever heard.
B00005N5S2|4.0|This is a good movie, very informative about MacArthur.  I would have liked to seen the 2hr 40min trade screen version because a lot of interesting events have been omitted from this movie that occurred in real life.  All in all, its refreshing that at least some people remember the greatest General of the United States ever.  His positives and negatives are portrayed in this movie very straightforward.  Hollywood has seemingly forgotten about the war in the Pacific against Japan.   In the past few years tons of movies have been made about the European theatre with almost zero about the Pacific.  MacArthur, the Army, Nimitz, the Marines, and the Pacific and their conflict relationship is quite interesting. I would love to see something to that effect on the big screen (not holding my breathe).
0385505833|1.0|John Grisham isn't Hemingway but I have always found his books entertaining.  However, I thought this one was painful to read - obvious, trite, and boring.  There was no mystery, no suspense (hard not to guess that the daughter would come home from Christmas, and that his neighbors wouldn't save the day) and old fashioned without any of the charm.  Take my advice and skip this one.  I gave mine away and even then wanted to warn the recipient that I wasn't doing her any favors.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Of all of the movies that came out in 2001, this has got to be the worst movie of them(and their are plenty of horrible big budget movies that were released this year).  The movies makes a couple of farm boys look like Demi-Gods against Japanese pilots who have been in combat for almost a decade.  Not only that, Afflect never did tell his Beckinsdale how he survived after being shot down in France all those months.  He says he'll tell her later but he never does.  One of the many loose ends that is conveniently forgotten.  There doesn't seem to be a overall moral like all war movies before except Americans are great and big explosions.    <br />Love story may have worked if they didn't throw the third wheel in but alas what could have been.  Tora, Tora, Tora is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better than this movie and that was made in 1970.  If only Tora, Tora, Tora was made with the kind of budget and special effects nowadays.  Don't walk, run away as far as possible from this movie.
B00005MP58|3.0|First of all, this movie, overall, exceeds 5 stars.  However, from a DVD-buying standpoint, this DVD \\"Special Edition\\" is somewhat of a disappointment.   I admit it.  I own both DVD editions, so I think I can speak fairly on the comparison.<br />COLOR:  As for England being bleak and dreary in real life, just as it appears in this version, fine, but it doesn't explain for why England was bright and vibrant before this Special Edition came out.  It's like someone (messed) with the \\"Tint\\" and \\"Brightness\\" adjustment on my TV.  Hello!  You call that \\"enhanced\\" picture?!  <br />SPECIAL FEATURES:  For all this film's popularity that initiated the release of a Special Edition, there's only ONE notable Special Feature...  the Behind The Scenes/Making Of- featurette.  The other features I could've done without.  Personally I'm not into reading miniscule passages off my TV screen. <br />What would've made it better:  a director's commentary track.  Or an actor.  Heck, commentary track from a gaffer or the ubiquitous Best Boy would've made this purchase worth it.  Or, how about deleted scenes?  Like the one where Lizzy kicks Caroline Bingley's (...)? (just kidding)<br />I understand that they no longer make the \\"Regular\\" edition (or in this case, the *better* edition).  If you care about the cinematic aspects of the film, it's worth the trouble of tracking the older DVD edition.  Buy this only if you \\"must have\\" the Behind The Scenes vignette.   <br />Regardless, this is still a superior and well-executed adaptation.  Ehle, Firth, & crew breath life and spirit into an already fabulous story and script.

B0000024TT|4.0|Leonard Cohen had always been nervous about entering the music business. He had been composing songs long before he started his career as a novelist and poet but his dry, croaky voice and gloomy songwriting style always led him to believe there would be little market his work in the Chuck Berry-based world of popular music in the nineteen-fifties and early sixties. That changed when Bob Dylan and the folk-rock movement of the mid-sixties proved that stark production, an unspectacular voice, a sole and somber acoustic guitar and a set of seriously inspired and graceful verses could muster magic and find a fanbase. When July Collins scored a hit with Cohen's song, \\"Suzanne\\" in 1966, the writer finally decided to try his hand at recording his debut album.<br />The first take on Cohen's distinct musical vision was an excellent one. Cohen muses about the gentle beauty of love (\\"Sisters of Mercy,\\" \\"Suzanne\\") and the warm safety of illusion (\\"The Stranger Song,\\" \\"Winter Lady\\") and howls at the desolation of betrayal, loneliness and loss (\\"Stories of the Street,\\" \\"One of Us Cannot Be Wrong,\\" \\"So Long Marianne\\"). The listener always feels as if he or she is with the artist and his cast of abused and abusive lovers, walking through their gray, wintery world. The utter iciness of Songs of Leonard Cohen can become a bit tedious but the fine story telling, shocking intimacy and levels of lyrical cleverness and elegance virtually unknown to Cohen's folk rock peers (\\"I loved you in the morning/Our kisses deep and warm/Your hair upon the pillow/Like a sleepy golden storm/Yes many loved before us/I know that we are not new/In city and in forest they smiled like me and you/But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie/Your eyes are soft with sorrow/Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.\\") nicely save it.<br />Despite its merit, Songs of Leonard Cohen did not bring Cohen a sizable audience or a significant standing in the folk rock world (There was not yet a sect of thatflowery, sentimental world for work as dark as Cohen's). It did, however, provide him a small, cult audience for whom he could comfortably record follow-ups to Songs of Leonard Cohen. But the singer would, to this day, remain a lone wolf. The talent, skill and originality that would always set this shadowy, sullen figure apart and above the typical folky was already in full bloom on his stunning debut.
B00003CXTG|3.0|I'm sure why so many hated this, especially guys. Sure it has a mooshy romance sub-plot, repeat sub-plot but it still has it's marcho guy war stuff in there as well. Plus I really liked the performances, especially Josh Hertnett who steals the show from Afflick. The one perfomance that I think deserves oscar consideration though is John Voight, he was so good that you would think he was Anthony Hopkins in this movie. He really deserves it, even if you didn't like the movie I doubt you could disagree.<br />  I found the war scenes that most people called cartoonish very engaging and well done. The only bad things are that it's too long, the whole love triangle thing is predictible and it trys too hard to be dramatic. Oh yeah plus Cuba Gooding Jr. is pretty much playing the same role he had in Men of Honor.  Other than that I was really into this film and had trouble seeing where it was actually......bad.
0446310786|2.0|For more than twenty-five years, To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee has been universally ingratiated into high school English programs. The repetitious dialogue; unhindered meandering; endlessly and needlessly branching plotline and much dated speech and setting has probably frightened more sophomores out of ever reading for fun than the Great Gatsby and Watership Down combined. But just because forcing teenagers to read a detailed account of growing up in 1930s Alabama is borderline child abuse does not mean there is nothing students can learn about good literature from To Kill a Mocking Bird. The characterization is presented masterfully; the descriptions are vivid; the narration is well done and it truly reflects the trials and tribulations of the time in which was written. To Kill a Mocking Bird is a fine piece of literature, but it's a terribly boring book.
156849114X|5.0|After a rather difficult start for the reader, the author deveops an exceedingly moving story (history) of the area in which Stonehenge and the Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary are located in Salsbury.  As a coincident, I was visiting my daughter and her family in Wimbledon when I was reading this book.  We visited the Salisbury plain, Stonehenge, and Cathedral and that visit multiplied my enjoyment of the book exponentially.<BR>The author traces four families from prehistoric times to the present in a saga like manner.  Truly an historic book, novel that it is.  I highly recommend this to all Anglophiles.
B00001OH7P|4.0|David Bowie's 1972 concept album, the Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, tells the story of a messiac, extraterrestrial rock star and his backing band who come to enthuse a doomed Earth with the power of rock and roll before Ziggy implodes due to substance abuse and untamable celebrity hysteria. The concept is a bit much. Bowie likely considered putting the tale on tape second priority to the groundbreaking, spectacular Ziggy Stardust stage show. Onstage such complex theatrics do not seem a melodramatic. Ziggy Stardust the record it is saved by the fact that Bowie interwove his opus with a slew of his best songs to date. Highlights include the subtle, smoky \\"Soul Love,\\" the rejoiceful \\"Starman,\\" the shrilling \\"Moonage Daydream,\\" which features an incredible guitar solo from the incomparable Mick Ronson, and a classic trilogy of rollicking, trashy, Stones-ish glam rock: \\"Hang Onto Yourself,\\" \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" and \\"Suffragette City.\\" Enough concept albums had been released by 1972 for Bowie, always an analytical rock star, to realize that all they key to a successful one was a steady mixture of concept and craft. While recording Ziggy Stardust, Bowie ripened his oeuvre for the stage but laced it with enough killer tunes to keep fans happy until he reached their hometown.
B00003CXTG|3.0|It's a great represenation of what happened 60 years ago. The only ting I take issue with is the where of all the young men in the film  are being so goofy, unconfident with women and clumsy in the first half for the sake of humour. It's a bit overdone. <br />The acting other wise is well done, but Dan akroyd seems out of place, and Jon Voight's FDR make-up looks obvious in some shots. He could have pulled it off without it.

Definitely a movie to watch on video and skip back and forward through but I still haven't got a handle on this.<br />Foonote: The 80's remake is awful, but worth watching if just for the contrast
B00000ILDE|5.0|It's a stand out in the muddled world of sci-fi and action films. The extra footage is worth viewing, but just to have it on DVD was enough for me.
B00003CX7L|5.0|This is perhaps Disney's best film yet, even managing to top the original, which is certainly a rare feat.  Basically it's a children's film for adults, who'll love the many movie references ('Jurassic Park' and 'The Empire Strikes Back' to name but two) and the jokes that go over the kids' heads.  Thankfully though, the film also delivers to the kids though too, with plenty of visual jokes as well.<br />There's not one annoying character, each one drawn sympathetically and realistically to help the audience completely forget that they're only watching an animated film.  The new characters are great too - especially Jessie (Joan Allen), Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammer) and Mrs Potato Head.  More importantly though, 'Toy Story 2' grips its audience with some stunning action pieces (with the camera moving as if Woody and co. were real) and real poignancy.  I can think of countless children's films that have been spoiled by an overly schmaltzy ending, but this is genuinely heart-warming, with the story of children outgrowing their toys being startlingly close to children outgrowing their parents.  Wisely picking Sarah McLachlan to sing the theme 'When She Loved Me', with her achingly sad vocals, works well.<br />Quite frankly, this is a movie that crosses all boundaries as well as all expectations.  One to be watched.
B00005RFAI|2.0|I tried to listen to her new cd objectively and not to compare it to &quot;Can't Take Me Home&quot; since it has been made clear that it was not going to be the same style.  <br /> Well, Linda RUINED Pink!!  <br />the words may be good but, i just cant sit and listen to this cd over and over like i was looking forward to doing.  Only about half the songs are worth my time.  the songs had no soul to them. no anger! no angst! no love! no GRRRL power! just passive lack of emotion.<br />  Please, Pink!  Your voice is fabulous and i look forward to a new cd with a new producer.
B000002ADT|5.0|Like all others here, I am compelled to pay homage to this masterpiece.  I didn't discover this work until about 10 years ago.  Listened to it.  Kind of liked it from the beginning and then after a few months and an occasional listen, I suddenly \\"got it\\" and became obessed with the work.  Today more than ever, I am convinced this is the greatest jazz album ever recorded.    Someone once made the observation that \\"Kind of Blue\\" was the ultimate album to listen to alone at 2:00 am.  It is.    I will not take you through a song by song analysis because that takes away from the balance of the album as a whole.  The only critcism I have is Columbia's decision to include the outtake of \\"Flamenco Sketches\\" in this latest release.  It was completely unnecessary and is a distraction.  Too bad you can't remove it from the CD.  Also, in the remastering, this release at times sounds a little \\"bright\\" but that is a minor nuisance when considering what a treasure this is.    Get this album and give it to others.  This is great music.

006097625X|5.0|Understanding Comics is a chronicle of the infinitely weird connection of words and pictures that is comics. It tells usabout the heart of the concept of moving your eyes across panels, looking at the pictures, reading the words, and perceiving them all as a unified, flowing entity. It told us how and why the concept of reading and creating comics works.<BR>Reinventing comics, on the other hand, focuses more on the public's attitude toward comics, the comic industry, and the varied possibilities of new ways of creating, distributing, marketing, purchasing, and reading comics. It contains many of Scott's theories as to how comics are and could be influenced by the internet and the new way of thinking it has brought us. <br />These are two very different books with two very different subject matters. However, they link hand in hand to aid us in viewing the medium of comics as a whole. If you liked Understanding Comics, you may or may not like Reinventing Comics.

6305807086|1.0|I wanted to like this film. Aww heck, I wanted to love it. I'm a big fan of black comedies in general. I've followed Spike Jonze's career for years, John Cusack is one of my favourite actors and Cameron Diaz... Well let's just say that my feelings towards Cameron Diaz are pretty much the same as every other hetrosexual male's. So this should have been a slam dunk. I liked the concept of the film (whatever else you think of it, you must give it kudos for its originality), the reviews were glowing. I was receptive, pumped and I was primed.<br />Then I saw the film...<br />And I did hate it with every fibre of my being.<br />There was not a single character I felt any affinity to. I found the situations contrived and pointless. The ideas explored were either bland or annoying. Being John Malkovich left me with a general feeling of sliminess. I felt dirty. The acting was over the top and all I was left with was an uncomfortable desire to slap everyone involved.<br />Was my reaction a little extreme? Perhaps, but don't let it get you down; I'm clearly in the minority here. People love this film. They go on and on about it, so if I've missed the point, well, my opinions are hardly going to drown out the true believers. But what if I'm right and they're the ones who are wrong? What if there are good, film-loving folks out there who are just embarassed to admit they don't get it? What if, as I suspect is true, there are vast hordes of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH haters out there, just waiting for someone to tell them that it's OK not to like this film?<br />Rise up, Rise Up! You have nothing to lose but your pretensions!<br />Its true, the Emperor has no clothes!
B0000004V2|5.0|I don't have to sell my soul, he's already in me. The devil has all the best tunes - Ian Brown knew that and the boy gods that were the Stone Roses knew people would start asking questions once they'd heard the glorious debut album. Surely nobody could create this wonderful noise without a little help from his satanic majesty.<br />This album stuns me. I must have listened to it a thousand times in the space of twelve years. It has grown familiar but will never breed contempt. Quite simply it is the finest collection of songs known to man or beast. It it is the greatest testament to the fact that music can be the the most powerful affirmation of what it is to be human, to feel, to live. Even now this record still has the power to knock me out of my miserable set of preconceptions, to kick me up the backside and tell me to get on with living, instead of simply moaning about how shitty life can be.<br />Three virtuoso musicians, one flawed but irresistibly charismatic singer. A song writing partnership that married technical brilliance, naive simplicity and a self belief so strong it almost conquered the world. What the Stone Roses possessed in spades was synergy, alchemy, magic - something so much more than the sum of their parts. The inexplicable electricity you feel as the bass line to I Wanna Be Adored thumps straight through you, as the liquid crystal guitar trickles into your brain, as the drums seem to rise up through your feet from the earth's core, and then that immortal first line, the crushingly insouciant delivery, almost whispered. You think it can't get better, and actually you're just about right - but it comes damn close. The opening guitar salvo of She Bangs the Drums screams at you to celebrate life - capturing the infectious sense of euphoria that you last felt when you were a kid, the sheer joy of waking up on a summer's day and running around in circles like a madman. Listening to Waterfall, I think of the first line of Tomorrow Never Knows - turnoff your mind relax and float downstream. It's as though they've managed to distil all the best harmonies, stolen from the Beach Boys, the Beatles and the Byrds, and made something infinitely more lovely - it positively lulls you. Sugar Spun Sister has the best chorus of any song ever, dripping sunshine and rainbows, honey and love. Made of Stone is an amphetamine surge, a call to arms exuding a sense of urgency and menace.  And with a killer guitar solo. This is the One means what it says - it captures that headrush when you're absolutely certain about someone, and everything is beautiful. And to the end. I am the Resurrection and I am the life. Close your eyes and you'll think you're flying.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Could this be the dawning for a new age of the movie-musical? From the opening curtain to the closing credits, MOULIN ROUGE was pure pleasure. The critics had me entering the theatre with low expectations... cue the opening dance sequence, and my senses are overwhelmed with sheer entertainment. Director Baz Luhrmann blows you away with brilliant tour de force and a love story that it sure to capture even the coldest of hearts.<BR>Ewan McGregor (Christian) truly shines in ROUGE. With flawless acting and a surprisingly ravishing voice, he gives his best and most notable performance to date. Belting out the 1970 Elton John hit, &quot;Your Song,&quot; McGregor gives the classic a new found glory and flare after 30 years. His voice commands the not quite original score (it was originally penned for 1996's ROMEO + JULIET), &quot;Come What May,&quot; with beauty and style. McGregor is indeed a rising talent that holds much more in store. <BR>Nicole Kidman (Satine) lights up the silver screen with charisma and flavor. Debuting her vocal talents, Kidman cuts loose with dance numbers and duets; not to mention a dramatic performance nothing short of excellent. Solos such as &quot;Some Day I'll Fly Away&quot; and &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot; showcase her musical onset (There has been talk of a future album from Kidman).<BR>Ewan and Nicole have an on-screen chemistry that even Romeo and Juliet would envy. Dazzling audiences with romantic duets, you will find yourself singing &quot;Come what may...&quot; and humming the tune of &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; long after you exit the theatre. Hence, an amazing movie makes for a beautiful soundtrack.<BR>This is definitely my favorite movie of the year. The National Board of Review seems to agree, naming it Best Film of 2001. I'd bet on McGregor, Luhrmann, and the film itself taking home the hardware on Oscar night.
B000056V73|4.0|\\"Almost Famous\\" is a sort of riff on Director Cameron Crowe's early years reporting for Rolling Stone.  You don't have to be a rock enthusiast to enjoy its sweetness.  Set in the early 1970's, when rock was drenched in a sort of easy-going, sun dried, alcohol and drug-fueled haze, and teenagers across America worshipped at the altar of Led Zeppelin with a fervor thought reserved by Star Trek fans, it tells the story of William Miller, a high-schooler trying to become a Rock N' Roll Journalist.  Preternaturally mature (by age 11, he's in the same class as 13 year olds, and they still hate him), and sheltered at home by a lovingly domineering mother (superb Frances Mcdormand), William falls in love with Rock yet is less determined to become a rocker himself than follow in the footsteps of  the legendary Lester Bangs, the self-appointed Dean of Rock Criticism.  Getting his first break writing for Bangs's \\"Creem\\" magazine, Miller gets his big break when he's tagged by Rolling Stone to cover the burgeoning band \\"Stillwater\\" on its \\"Almost Famous '73\\" tour.  Bangs remains ever present mentoring Miller through the process of covering the fast-rising band, an endeavor that requires Miller to remain aloof and objective, but not so distant that the band's suspicious members won't shun him as \\"the enemy\\".  Despite her better instincts, and on Miller's oath that he won't miss high-school graduation, Miller's mother allows the boy to go on tour with Stillwater, a fictional band loosely hinting such 70's confabs as Credence, the Allman Brothers and the Eagles.  A steady stream of sex with the band's dedicated groupies (called \\"Band-aids\\", young girls with fake names who insist that they're there for the music) and various feuds between band members helps to occupy Stillwater's principals, and frustrate Miller's attempts to get the band to say anything coherent on tape.  Too sweet (or uncool) to be insistent, Miller follows the band across America, watching self-imposed deadlinescome and go.  Adding to Miller's stress is his own burgeoning love for Band-Aid in-chief, \\"Penny Lane\\" (Kate Hudson), whose adoration for Russel Hammond (Crudup), Stillwater Lead Guitar, blinds her to how the band uses its groupies.<br />\\"Almost\\" is a great movie, one of those understated gems from director Cameron Crowe. Though an anthem to 70's rock fandom, the film excels on its characters -  Stillwater's lead vocalist's pompous platitudes on the significance of Rock, Crudup's acid-induced meanderings at a party he crashes in Topeka, Phillip-Seymour Hoffman as the sage Bangs and especially Macdormand.  Like a band, the film excels not only on solo acts but also on how the characters impact each other - the look on the Topeka partygoers or (in one of the flick's running gags) the look on the faces of hotel workers who have to take messages from Miller's mother, or the lecture that Hammond receives from Mrs. Miller herself.  (I'm not sure if Mcdormand's character is supposed to be a reference to the song, Mother\\", off of Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\".)  Above all, the script drips with tasty lines, bizarrely unforgettable zen koans (like the one about groupies who eat steak but don't use birth control) and a fair amount of period rock references.  When Crudup's Russel Hammond proclaims himself a \\"golden god\\", you might miss the Zeppelin reference, but you won't miss the imagery, one of a lost age that outdid ancient Greece in resembling the cover of \\"Houses of the Holy\\".
0385484518|5.0|I was very impressed after I read the book  &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot;.It was a book about a professor and a student who teach me what is life. However, I never read a book like this before.I will definitely recommend it to others. There are so many things you can learn from this book. For me Morrie wasn't only a teacher, he was a therapist, a therapist who teaches people how to deal with their own problems and he also teaches us how to help others, how to pay attention to others.<BR>Morrie teaches us how to embrace life with strength, self confidence, and pride no matter what your condition might be. I also learned from the book that love is the greatest because Morrie showed it to us. He loves himself even more,his family and all his good friends that were around him. There is another important lesson I learned from the book. It was about marriage. Morrie gave us the rules to control our relationship.<BR>I really like the part where Morrie was talking about death. We must not be afraid to die because one day we must all leave this world. Therefore, we need to use our confidence, our strength to help us go through our final days.<BR>That's why I recommend this book to other people to read and then after they read it they will find a meaning for life.
0792844793|2.0|I'll keep this short: although this is one of my favorite movies, the DVD is absolutely wretched. The image transfer quality just plain sucks.

Guess they couldn't be bothered to find a decent print or do a proper transfer, which is a crying shame.
B00005R2M3|2.0|I think Shakira is a wonderful artist.  Her previous 2 albums, along with her MTV Unplugged session, proves to me that she's incredibly talented and has a knack for good songwriting.  Her voice is captivating, and she ain't bad lookin' either.  ;-)<br />However, I'm really disappointed with her latest effort, Laundry Service.  I didn't mind her trying to cross over to English, but after hearing the outcome, I changed my mind.  Her English-singing voice is higher than her Spanish voice, which loses its appeal to me.  The songs feel like rehashed American rock and roll songs, with little or no heart in them.  Oddly, even though the lyrics are almost identical to her Spanish songs, they just don't carry over into English well at all.<br />Fortunately, there are some songs in Spanish, but they aren't that great either.  The only two songs that are any good are Suerte and Te Aviso, Te Anuncio.  Although this album is subpar, you might want to check out Pies Descalzos and Donde Esta Los Ladrones, which will give you a real taste of Shakira.

B000001DQI|5.0|This album is absolutely fantastic.  My dad is a die-hard Elton fan, and I actually borrowed this from him to listen to.  After hearing it, I had to have it for myself.  It has several classics, like &quot;Norma Jean&quot; and &quot;Benny and the Jets,&quot; but also a lot of great songs that I had never heard before, like &quot;Funeral for a Friend/Love lies bleeding.&quot;  The combination of these two songs is awesome, starting as an often beautiful instrumental and turning into a great rock song.  I will actually start the CD over after this combo so I can hear it again right away. This is one of those CD's where I can honestly say that there isn't a song on it that I don't like. The entire album is a pleasure to listen to.  If you like what many people would consider Elton John's greatest hits, you'll probably love listening to this particular CD.  It really is great.
6305350205|5.0|For me, I personally loved this entry in the series because it goes back to the magic of the original show in a way. Finally, you have Kirk demoted from Admiral (&quot;The Voyage Home&quot;) to Captain, and he gets to live out another adventure with his crew as captain of the Enterprise. You bring back Jerry Goldsmith (&quot;The Motion Picture&quot;) to compose a masterpiece of all Trek musicals. And you give the characters more roles than they did in the last films. It truly goes back to the spirit of the show. After all, one of the dillemas with movie adaptions is that they tend to take away that magic. William Shatner does recapture that magic with this film which was his directorial debut. He brings in an interesting story in terms making you wonder if God could really exist out there in space. In a way the whole movie is about understanding each other, and our place in the universe. Although it does mimic the first movie, it does have a fast-paced feel, and it makes up for the first film in more special ways than one. Fun and enjoyable no matter what.
B000009QPE|5.0|This one is definitely their Mona Lisa.  Its amazing that a band can sound like a buzzsaw and have such intense hooks and melodies.  The musicianship of this band is mind blowing.  I think that explains why they have such a diverse following (albeit most fans I've met don't readily admit liking Slayer or fit the headbanger grit profile).<br />Reign in Blood is a heart thumping experience.  The lyrics are maybe a little to direct and over the top and distract from the music, which is bleak nihilism in overdrive.  My other beef is that my favorite Slayer song, &quot;Spill the Blood,&quot; isn't on this album.  I love the irony of that song (beautiful melody + gruesome lyrics= pure evil).  All in all, this CD easily gets 5 stars.
B00005R2BG|5.0|I can't emphasize how amazing this film is!  Quite honestly I've never seen anything like it.  It's a film that appeals to all of our senses and takes them on a roller coaster ride.  It's touching, funny, beautiful and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's my favorite movie ever!  Ewan is so amazingly gorgeous and talented he truly deserves an oscar for this.  Nicole Kidman is beautiful and truly does a great job.  Buy this movie and I can gaurentee you'll watch it over and over again!
B00005QK3W|5.0|Driving Rain is a CD that gets better with repeated listening.  It's like the music is ziplocked and needs to be repeated for full appreciation.  The opener &quot;Lonely Road&quot; is a great rocker, &quot;I hear your music &amp; it's driving me mad.&quot;  The burning lead guitar makes this quality pop.  The piano-based stately pop tune &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot; is touching.  The nursery-rhyme melody on &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot; works well with the heavy electric guitar, the fuzz distortions on the vocal; and comes out with a ominous, spooky sound.  Very different, but excellent.  The title tune is fun.  Sure, &quot;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, let's go for a drive,&quot; is not the most complex lyric McCartney has ever penned, but his spirited vocals make this a driving pop tune.  I love the string arrangement on the sentimental acoustic love song &quot;I Do.&quot;  McCartney's such a great bass player; and this whips &quot;Tiny Bubble&quot; into pure confection, &quot;All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside the truth.&quot;  The sweet melody counterpoints the hidden wisdom.  McCartney's soaring vocal is great on the pretty pop tune &quot;Magic.&quot;  &quot;Your Way&quot; is a sweet country-western flavored ditty.  &quot;Spinning On an Axis&quot; written with son James McCartney is an interesting idea for a song and is pleasant enough, but is probably not one other singers will rush to cover.  For me, the high points of the CD are tracks 10, 11 &amp; 12.  McCartney smokes on the rocker &quot;About You.&quot;  This is followed by a beautiful piano on &quot;Heather&quot; which is instrumental about two-thirds of the way through until McCartney sings, &quot;Here I will stay for a year &amp; a day til the cares of the world drift away.&quot;  This is beautiful music!  Track 12 is another song written with son James that is great, the bluesy contemplative &quot;Back in the Sunshine Again&quot; where McCartney wishes for &quot;no more pain.&quot;  &quot;Your Loving Flame&quot; is a soft melody made of cloud vapor.  The sitar noodlings on &quot;Riding to Jaipur&quot; are an obvious George Harrison tribute that almost works.  It segues into &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; which rocks with lyrics about the bird of Paradise.  The live &quot;Freedom&quot; ends the disc and actually sounds better to me listening to the CD than when I watched the tribute show on tv.  This is a CD that you will need to spend time with to unlock.  It is worth the journey!r Loving Flame&quot; is a soft melody made of cloud vapor.

0385484518|4.0|I am glad to read this book.I find many good ideas helping me to live with my neighborhorhood.This book advises me to be more human than materialist.Investment in human relationship is everyting in life.Apart from that,some orther terms are also very exciting such as:love, family, death, compassion,marriage,forgiveness,etc..<BR>For Morrie,family is the base of the society.Having somebody who care of you in the joy like in sadness is meaningful.About love,Morrie advises me to devote myself to loving others in paying heed to them and in giving them time.For him, no bad marriage;there are only bad partners.To be successful,it must have for base respect and communication.This is a good book to read.I love it.
B00004XQ83|4.0|(...)I had no trouble with this one on my PC:  I was able to play the CD and encode the tracks as MP3s (for personal use, of course).<br />It goes without saying that the music was great.
B0000048V8|5.0|a young associate gave this video to me to share with our grand children.  He said they would all love it.  I thought he was mad because our grandkids range in age from 22 to 2.  He was totally right.  This video is a visual feast with  beautiful instrumental accompaniment.  The story of a young boy who builds a lovely snowman and then has wonderful adventures with this snowman. It is a quiet, soothing antedote for the entire family. Small ones seem not to tire of watching and it is a lovely lullaby.
B000021YQV|3.0|Usually I don't follow &quot;death-metal&quot; groups like SOAD seems to be, but this is one of the few groups that i do like.  The other difference between them and most other bands that I like is that I don't concentrate on the lyrics as much-while they're important, I don't believe in a lot of what he says, but they do make me think a lot (just look at the monologues in Prison Song, or the rubber-bullet-service-with-a-smile line in...well I'm not sure which one).  When they're not concentrating on government or groupies, they DO have some interesting thoughts (Bounce-a pogo stick?  I love it), and musically, they're very talented.  Middle easter influences with hard metal...really nice.  The singer I like and that guitarist is cool...in a freaky sort of way.  I'm not sure if I will get their self titled, but when they put another one out I will certainly take much more interest in it than I did with this one at first.
B00005ATQI|5.0|this is one of my faverite horror flick even though i am only 16 i love this movie it scared (...)me and i feel in love with the whole plot and i love how jack does the slow transformation from a normal person to a nut case if you like horror and scary stuff you have to see this movie (...)
B00003CXZ1|3.0|Most of the sets were great, I also liked many of the stunts and special effects but not really a great movie. I've seen the Indiana Jones movies, didn't think they were great either, and found this one to be very similar in nature although perhaps more oddly paced. Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft might actually be better than Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones but really you're getting Indiana with a braid and an accent. It's O.K. to spend a couple of hours with but not deeply satisfying.
0385505833|1.0|I kept waiting for it to get interesting.  The only thing it was, was predictible.
0425173755|5.0|If I had to select a single Christie novel to read again for the first time, this would be my choice; more than twenty years after my first encounter with the novel I can still recall my complete amazement. I strongly urge those who have not seen the film version to avoid it until you have experienced the sheer pleasure of being being tricked by the master trickster herself.  For MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, superlatives are not enough.
B000002WCJ|4.0|Actually,this is probably THE best Helloween album you can buy. The reasons would be a vocalist by the name of Michael Kiske and a guitat player by the of Kai Hansen. In my opinion Michael Kiske should have gone far in his solo career and Gammaray should be more popular than they are. But that is another story.<br />As for Keeper Of The Seven Keys Part 2,this is a cd that is pretty easy on the ears as most of the songs get you hooked the first time around. Highlights on this cd are 'Eagle Fly Free' and 'We Got The Right'. If you thought about trying out a helloween cd then I would actually recommend you start here and then get Keeper of The Seven Keys Part 1. The production here is a bit more polished and not as raw as Keeper 1,but if you are going for a long drive somewhere or just need a bit more diversity in the way the songs are structured then I would go with this one.<BR> <BR>So there you have it. Buy this one and experience the vocal power of Michael Kiske and then after listening you want more then go out and buy Keeper 1.<BR> <BR>By the way,there is a whole new era for Helloween starting with the great cd 'Master Of The Rings' that you might want to try but features a new singer,member changes,etc
0385505833|4.0|While not one of his legal thrillers, the short 175 page book has the charm of his &quot;A Painted House.&quot;  Typical of Grisham the novel is a light easy read.  The story depicts the tale of an accountant tired of spending so much money on Christmas not to have anything to show for it.  It follows him and his wife along as they encounter many obstacles of the season on their way.  The feeling I got in the final chapter of the book makes it a must read for the holiday season when we all take too much for granted.
