B00F4JPHUK|4|I usually use oil but this is nice for people who don't want oil.  I do have to say it doesn't always all absorb when working with men (hair) but it is a great quality product.
B002CMLHEC|5|I love this product. Makes my hair soft and shiny.  I don't use anything else. Just a few sprays of this on damp hair, blow dry, and go! I will definitely buy again.
B00462E8E2|5|No surprises here!  I've been using this product for years and it doesn't fail to perform its restorative wonders.
B002SVG36O|5|This is a great product
B004483ZF6|1|I love hello kitty, but this bag its a little cheap. I know the price wasn`t crazy but still. Itsliterally falling apart. Im very sad.
B00KQC7X5M|3|This is a relatively small amount, I am going to use it on my legs so I am going to see if it works well. I'll let you know how it goes.
B00CF7HBA8|5|Best hair clips I've ever used
B00LL7F4U2|3|You get what you pay for. This is good for touch ups mainly, it doesn't get that hot
B008KBKK9M|5|Looks better in person than in picture.  I would recommend if you have a lot of hair this is not for you but it is gorgeous.

B000BIVY9C|1|I seldom return a product even if not quite satisfied with it, but I very much wanted to return this body wrap kit. Unfortunately for me, the company has a \\"no return\\" policy. This body wrap is way more trouble than it is worth.  I followed the directions carefully and lost a mere 1/2 inch overall. But even the poor results are not the problem. After you apply the mud, you wrap your body in soaked ace bandages, then put on a sauna suit for 30 plus minutes. During this 30 minutes this \\"mud\\" drips and runs. If you do light exercise, as I did, to increase results, anywhere you have walked, stood, or been will have this \\"mud\\" all over it and it does not clean up easily. I probably lost more weight cleaning up the mess than using the product. I now firmly believe if you want a body wrap treatment, pay a professional.
B00178HQ2O|5|The color has been discontinude in the store so I was happy to find it on line. It is a beautiful color.
B00M4M7X48|3|Hmmmm....still working with this product. It dries awfully fast... like cement.  Yep...my skin certainly in glows after using this clay, but perhaps because I have to scrub do hard to get it off.  I've limited the use to my face, because trying to use it on the feet created such a mess.  At the end if the process I had to wash about 5 towels, wash cloths, sponges and sponges.  My bathtub looked like my six cats and dog had diarrhea attacks at the same time. What a mess to clean up ! Result:  Didn't work on my very light calluses at all !  I'm not putting myself thru this anymore.  Back to salon !<br />Oh....one more thing.  No way am I putting this in my hair.
B005VDLJEM|5|I bought two of these to split up and add to goody baskets for Christmas. Smells great and everyone loved it.
B003IL8BQS|5|Very happy with the results, minimizes fine wrinkles around my eyes.
B007NTYUGG|5|This is the first time I have worn falsies daily and these lashes are perfect for me. The little ridge/band helps make the application process easier. I have to cut them just a bit for a custom fit and that's okay. Some might think they are too long, but not for my taste. They are the perfect thickness to look realistic and natural, but with enough length to offer a little glamour. They don't look \\"drag queenish\\" either.<br /><br />I am getting two to three uses out of them too! Simply soak in alcohol for a bit. Afterwards, rest the lash on your index finger and hold it with your thumb while using tweezers to gently pull the old glue from the lash. Place them back in the case and they are ready for next time.<br /><br />You can't beat the price and I'm so glad I purchased two boxes! When I get down to one box, I will order another two boxes to make sure I always have them on hand.  Shipping takes a long time (about a month), but for the rock-bottom price of about 25 cents per pair, I don't mind planning ahead!<br /><br />To all the other people who are commenting about the glue and \\"fake\\" positive reviews: The glue that comes with is VERY small, but honestly, the lashes are already a SUPER bargain, so go out and buy some glue and have it ready when you get the lashes in the mail. STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SMALL STUFF! Finally, this is a real review by a real person and there is nothing fake about me...except my lashes. :-)
B003N4MIDM|4|softly scented, cleans well.  fragrance doesn't 'cling' like many other soaps (mainly the 'regular' kind)&#34;. minus 1 for the fact like other Castile soaps the spout eventually gets clogged which requires intervention (cleaning).  word of advice: one doesn't need an entire pump to receive a suitable quantity of soap from this container - seems downright wasteful to use an entire pump each time.  I use only 1/3 to 1/2 pump at the most each time.
B00RFWKUWO|5|So lightweight and easy to use!  Love how it makes me wavy hair straight without using too much effort!
B00QZ67O6G|5|You can't go wrong with Philips Sonicare!  This HX6921/04 Flexcare+ model is fully loaded with everything you need for complete gum care.  You pay extra for these features over their more basic models so I recommend you speak with your dental hygienist or dentist about what would be the best model for the current condition of your mouth.  The box I received also has a $70 bonus of a $50 toward a philips zoom professional whitening treatment which is nice if you want to do that; I did not, so I will not be reviewing that only the toothbrush.  Phillips Sonicare is the #1 recommended brand by dental professionals and I have to agree that once I tried it, I would never go without it again.  Having a clean mouth is just so important to your health and sense of well-being.<br /><br />I tested the different modes as described on this Amazon webpage and they all seemed to be functioning as described and promised.  I feel like what i receive is exactly what I was expecting after viewing the Amazon webpage which is good.  I have been using Philips Sonicare for decades and have never had a model die on me or need servicing.  I highly recommend Philips Sonicare including this model the Flexcare+ if this is the model your dental professionals say is the best choice for your mouth.
B00DDZ3Q3M|4|I switched to gluten-free mineral eye shadow that falls off my bare eyelid easily.  Gabriel eye primer does a good job making the shadow stay in place if you pat rather than brush on.  Warm beige works well for my olive complexion with neutral undertones. I would recommend this excellent primer for anyone struggling with mineral eyeshadow application or who have pigmented eyelids.
B0051MQ3UI|5|This was a gift, and very well liked for the excellent quality of these Philosophy products. If you suffer from chapped lips, you will love this lip treatment.
B002HSM6BO|5|Thanks to the Art of Manliness I found this powder, nice light scent that accents the Pinaud Clubman aftershave well. Works well with Old Spice as well.
B004QWPIO6|5|Very neat compact design and solid construction.  Easy to adjust, hold, and use.  Truly multi-groom and leaves a very even cut.
B001ET764E|5|I've used this product for years but have found it hard to find it in any store where I live.  That's why this is such a great deal.  This sticks last at least a year.  When you consider that regular deodrant costs $3 or $4 a pop and only lasts a month or two this is the deal of the centurn.  Also, it's a really healthy alternative to using regular deodrant that can clog pores and stain clothing.  This product eliminates any odor even if you sweat a lot.  I use it before I got workout and even though I build up a sweat there is on odor.<br /><br />The only people who might not find this helpful are people with particular medical condition, but for most people it will work great.
B000EMDKC4|5|Awesome shampoo! Probably the best I've found. The conditioner that goes with it.. is perfect also. Does wonders on my dry, thin, brittle hair. Thanks for sending so quickly!
B00KX7XI3Q|2|I must have got a bad bottle - it was the consistency of water and it smelled terrible - like hydrogen peroxide.  Also, when I put on my foundation it balled up and flaked off my face.  I tried it for a couple evenings but couldn't take the smell.  Back to Amazon it goes.
B008U5415W|5|I didn't quite know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. The size is perfect for travel. The price was great too. Delivery was quicker than anticipated.
B001426RO6|5|I've tried a lot of eyebrow waxing products and strips over the years and these are by far the best ones I've tried!  The wax area is nice and small, so you can really get in close and get a nice clean line on your brows. The wax is nice and sticky, so it really picks up a lot of hair when you use it (you can only use it once though, not multiple times like some wax strips I've used).  I've never had any reactions to the wax or the oil since I've started using them (admittedly, I only use the oil on occasion). The best part is that I haven't paid to get my eyebrows professionally waxed since purchasing this product.  I am planning to purchase the other Parissa wax products to use to remove the peach fuzz on the rest of my face.
B000YJ2SLG|5|I've never been satisfied with lotions. They were either too sticky, smelt bad, too thin and required multiple applications, or felt waxy and didn't really absorb into my skin and moisturize. I've tried Vaseline, Aveeno, Eucerin, B&B Works, & Jergens to name a few and always felt like I was compromising. I always thought surely there was something better.<br /><br />Then I found this little gem. It's simply the best lotion I've ever used.<br /><br />-Unscented<br />-Non-comedogenic<br />-Perfect consistency (easy to apply while still feeling rich)<br />-Non-irritating for sensitive skin<br />-No stickiness or residue<br />-Absorbs instantly<br /><br />My favorite thing about this lotion however is, in my opinion, what makes it truly unique. After a few days of using it you'll notice your skin retains its own moisture with increased efficiency. Things like hot showers & dry air aren't so threatening anymore. Your skin stays smooth & healthy for much longer. I don't even have to use this daily anymore. I wouldn't call this a lotion because it doesn't just temporarily mask dry skin- it heals it. It's like it teaches your skin how to fend for itself.<br /><br />CeraVe also has a moisturizing cream, but it's very thick and leaves skin feeling sticky. I wouldn't recommend it unless you<br />prefer a bulkier moisturizer. In my experience the lotion works just as well without the stickiness and difficulty spreading.<br /><br />TL;DR: try this lotion. It works well.
B00PGAXJMU|5|This is a wonderful product I recently started adding to my DIY vitamin C serum.  Will most certainly order again. Thank you for the outstanding service!
B00AKJ4HKA|5|This lipstick is creamy and fully pigmented. Leaves your lips soft and it is the perfect color for my skin tone NW 25.
B00TI0LPVQ|1|Fell apart as soon as i took it out of the package
B00YX85K50|5|Bought this to make my own eyelash growth serum with natural oils; exactly what I needed. Fast shipping and great price. Thanks
B00O78UI4O|5|Nice highlighter. Does not look overdone but natural. Wears well and does not have to be put on multiple times. Feels light on skin. My skin without anything on it actually feels better and looks better after using these products.
B000TDG2PU|5|I love this conditioner!! It does wonders on your hair...natural or extensions. I highly recommend it especially in this size.
B000NL0T1G|5|Adjusted quickly to the new process and am enjoying the new shave.  At 80 went back to the shaving method  of my youth.
B005DM0XVQ|5|Wonderful product - unable to locate it anywhere but Amazon!  Thanks!!
B003MBV9MW|5|Great between getting hair colored. Easy to use and lasts until shampoo hair. I strongly recommend this product. Must buy
B0010LNIZM|1|This was my mistake when ordering....the hassels returning Amazon purchases will make me think it over carefully before ordering again.  After a 2+ hour \\"chat\\" with Amazzon, the chatter still did not get it & clearly had a lack of uderstanding English. Eventually another customer servivce emailed me & most of the problems have been resolved.I still have this 3/4 Helen of Troy that I don't want. This process of returns has taken over 2 weeks.
B00VKHKH8C|5|Very nice oil and customer service.
B0036BI56G|3|I have used better products, did nothing for the appearance of my skin.
B000FQUGXA|1|OK
B00702GTI8|5|I love this product! It is no longer available online so I was very excited when I found it here!
B00021CTQA|5|I have tried many lip glosses, and this one is the most addictive - in a good way. First off, it doesn't contain any acids or other ingredients that actually make my lips even more chapped from using it. It just goes on soothing, and looks glossy and gorgeous too. Plus the colors are agreeable to most skin tones, and the flavors are delicious (Note: I'm not  recommending you ingest the lip gloss! Ha ha.) <br /> <br />My only complaint about the Sugar lip gloss is that this particular tube style - the one you squeeze - has a construction flaw where it can crack after many uses, leaking a sticky mess in your purse. Stick with the wand type, and you'll be just fine.
B0011DP24Y|4|At first I thought I was going to hate this shampoo because it didn't lather up as much as non-organic shampoos but it actually kept my hair very healthy looking. My hair is usually full of static electricity in the winter (and this winter has been brutally dry and cold) but since I started using this shampoo I've hardly had any trouble with static.
B004UTS0B8|5|End Fixture for attachment are firm and tight making the delivery of nebulizer treatment efficient and effective
B001FOBFRW|5|I saw these in a local store for $75.00.  I was intrigued by the ingredients, and found the short list appealing. I also like that once the soap is gone, there is no plastic remaining and I can recycle the cardboard. That is an issue to me every time I have bought face cleaning products in the past. I also like that this soap does not have any chemical additives, and I like how my skin feels after I use it.  As long as I can get these soaps, especially at amazon's price, I will not be going back to any of the more expensive products I used to buy.
B008UPHT8I|4|VERY NICE EYE CREAN, YOU REALLY FEEL HOW IT GOES INTO YOUR SKIN. iT SEEN IT HIDRATES VERY GOOD BUT THE DARK CIRCLES DON´T CHANGE
B004KTFBXS|5|I usually use the olive oil (green). I like this when I want to wear my curls loose instead of pulled back into a bun. Compared to the green, it's not as tight of a hold and my hair felt softer using the same amount of product.
B00IO7FJJS|5|This REALLY works and smells soooooo good,
B001B11ZV0|5|Just as promised. Helped us organize supplies in our baby's room. May order another for our master bath
B000ULLKLW|3|While this lip balm is adequate, it has a sticky consistency so I would probably not buy again.
B000UGYCP8|5|very good
B004I2MQ6M|5|I always like Aveeno's products and decided to give this sunblock a try.  It's the best one I have ever used, compare to many other name brands.<br /><br />It goes on like a regular facial lotion, just a little thicker. It's hydrating (I have very dry skin), yet it doesn't leave that greasy shine on the face.  Many sunblocks have a chemical smell, this one doesn't, and I can use it as a base before putting on foundation.  Importantly, it doesn't irritate my skin at all.  Some other sunblocks tend to so heavy, which makes the skin hard to breathe, or give ashy color.  This Aveeno product is light and goes on without adding weird ashy color to the skin.<br /><br />Last summer I was in Istanbul traveling for 10 days in the sun, and it works beautifully.  Normally I get dark super fast, and this Aveeno product did a fabulous job protecting me from sun damage and I didn't get dark at all.<br /><br />This is also such a great everyday product, especially for the summer.  Most foundations and BB creams, although they say they have SPF protection, they don't work that well.  This Aveeno product is light in texture yet protect great protection that I love using it everyday.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!  It seems like Aveeno is not making this anymore.  So, get it while it lasts!
B0000BY85E|5|I was impressed with how easy it is to use. I have never used a trimmer, but this was really simple. It has a little bag for storage and a brush for cleaning.
B004BCZ93Q|5|So pigmented, you don't have to reapply throughout the day either. This is one of the best eyeliners I've ever used and it shipped pretty fast.
B00ID4YD3A|5|I like it so much
B0091XIQBC|5|Item arrived quickly and in excellent (new) condition.  I was especially pleased to get such a good price on a discontinued product.
B009126EY4|1|The blush has no pigment in it and does not show up on my skin. very disappointing this is supposed to be a safe well made product line. waste of money
B00GSZNT04|2|Dont uderstand all the hype with Wen,  it left my hair feeling flat, dry and frizzy. The scent was ok, but nothing special. Retuned it.
B00119TXES|5|Overall I am very pleased with the product, the smell wasn't that bad and once you wax there is no color left behind like with the red hard wax. I was looking for a hard wax so I could do my own brazilian at home. I have a Gigi wax warmer and this product did fit. I didn't have problems with the seller and the product came here on time.
B00FO7TRMG|4|I great way to get baby smooth feet!
B00283O7LK|5|I like this glass nail file. It's thin and makes my nails very smooth. I'm so happy that I have it!
B008MBWEP8|5|Beautiful color, very little spread, easy application
B003YCAOXO|5|Love this.. Such a soft breautiful scent. Constantly get compliments on how nice it smells.
B00I5571ZO|5|Feels great on my skin and doesn't break me out! I'm sensitive, so lots of products do cause irritation or breakouts. I love the way my skin feels when I get up every morning!
B0011DL6R6|5|Fantastic! I use it to protect a bleached section of my hair from pool chemicals and it works fabulously. It keeps my hair soft all day without feeling greasy. A little goes a long way, too!
B002ADDGFG|1|This product was overpriced for what it is.
B008BUDNVE|5|This is the greatest thing invented for washing your back.  I use it every day.  It's light weight and drys really fast.  They seem to last forever.
B009M8RV0I|5|Great product! Love this carrot oil. I've been using it for a sunscreen and it seems to be doing the trick! I received the product fast, and they threw in an awesome serum! Now I'm just trying to figure out what the serum was they put in the package!
B002UFIAT6|4|The soap, shipment and package were as expected!! EXCELLENT<br />I bouht this soap for a friend of mine which find the Asepso soap essentialfor her needs!
B005OYDID8|4|Been using it for two weeks now.  Was a bit uneasy when I first opened the packaging as it feels like a toy in your hand (not real solid or heavy), but as used it actually does a fine job.  I especially like the shape of the head (two foils stacked at an angle) and it's very easy to clean.  I don't believe it would survive a drop to a tile floor (who here hasn't dropped their shaver), but I'll be careful.  A bit &#34;old school&#34;... nothing fancy, no pivoting head (why I bought it), no battery meter... just a very basic foil shaver that does a fine job.
B005THVYJ0|5|I was thrilled to find this product on Amazon after Mary Kay discontinued it.  It's been my favorite foundation for a few years now, so I was pretty upset when I heard MK no longer offered it.  It covers very well (I am someone who battles acne) and feels very light on the face, almost as if nothing is there.  Also, I have pretty sensitive skin and this is one of the only foundations that doesn't make my face go crazy!  Highly recommend!
B002U774PK|3|Nice, compact, inexpensive,  painless, and easy to use. Been using it almost everyday am and pm for about one month now but have yet to see the &#34;lifting&#34; effect on the outer corners of my upper eyelids which are a bit droopy. I was also hoping to see a smoothing out on creepiness around the eyes and crow´s feet that are not too deep yet. Can´t really see any difference. I use it about 5 minutes each eye in an outward and up technique starting from the inner bottom corner of my eye up towards my temple. I also do the upper lid according to the simple diagram in the instructions. Was hoping this little gadget would work some and help me postpone any injections or surgery. Guess I´ll keep using it some more and hope for some results. Maybe I´m not doing it right or long enough? Any suggestions?
B00NLIO5V8|5|just what I needed
B0080MGH5M|4|Pretty good! Goes on smoothly and doesn't look like I have heavy makeup/foundation on, but makes my face look smooth and even.
B001B2L19U|5|The best Anti-dandruff shampoo!
B0012RST8K|5|Great
B000TMD4YS|5|This is the only facial lotion I use. It helps with any hints of rosasia or redness of the face and is very gentle on my skin. A little goes a long way so start out with a pea size per area.
B00143UYPS|5|Love love love this lotion as I can't leave it in the bathroom or my teenage sons use it all up!!!!!!I seriously just had to go and buy a new bottle yesterday and I paid 18$ for it at a health food store ...so getting 32oz.on Amazon is a steal from now on I will most definitely be ordering from here.on to the lotion I don't have anything negative to say about this lotion I've been using it about 4 years now and its one of the best if not the best body lotions I've ever tried it has a fantastic scent to it and it keeps my SKIN so soft and moisturized until I shower again. Which to me says ALOT I've had body lotions in the past that I've applied directly out of the shower and a couple hours later It felt like I hadn't applied anything.I see why both my boys love this so much it really works great and dosent smell feminine I wish I could describe the smell but u just can't I guess to me It smells fresh??I don't think anyone with dry skin who purchases this will be sorry.
B00MFF8WNU|5|Awesome product delivered fast and efficiently! Thank you I will purchase again :)
B00BAZ7Y6M|5|I really like this tool.  It is easy to use and it is durable.
B00387F42G|5|Truly works in reducing fine lines.
B00027D0DU|5|Perfect. The price is very good too.
B0007ICRIS|2|When I ordered this product it was listed on Amazon as \\"in stock\\"-it took three weeks to arrive. The first time I used the brush the barrel was loose and I could not figure out why-until it completely came off!!! Instead of going through the hassle of returning it and waiting who knows how long for a replacement, I used Gorilla Glue to put the barrel back on the handle-and now it works fine. So...I like the brush but it took a little effort!
B000052YC9|5|This is a great cleaner. I wear my dentures at night. When I get up in the morning, I put them in the cleanser as I am getting ready for work. I pop them in before I leave and I'm off!!
B0018A32XS|1|Suckz..didn't cut ..rolls over but doesn't really cut at all.
B00005302J|1|This purchase was a BIG disappointment to me -- I remember Palmolive Bath Bars as having a wonderful smell -- these have NO<br />smell!!  All things I have bought before at Amazon have been exactly what I wanted and I was very satisfied -- Not this time!!
B003QQKK8C|4|I love the scent.  Just be careful to gently mix it by turning top to bottom a few times before each use.
B00EDZD2ZS|5|If you are going to pay for top notch work, why not make sure that you are using the best moisturizers?  It would be a shame to see all that hard work go down the drain, all because you didn't want to pony up $20.  Do yourself a favor and buy this kit.  It's one stop shopping and it has everything you need.  You won't be sorry.
B007M4D49Q|1|Cheap. uncomfortable. Messy. I hate these lashes. I thew them away after the first use. I guess you get what you pay for. Do not buy these.
B003S54I02|5|prompt service. exactly what I wanted
B007OXFB78|5|Love this product, I actually got it for my husband as its his favorite. He keeps it by his bathroom sink.
B007SZCG0C|5|This shampoo works great for my hair. I noticed a a change in the texture of my hair. It looks and feels great. I don't have any hair loss problems but I do notice my hair growing back thicker and quicker.
B002XITZ2G|5|I love Issey Miyake fragrances for men and women and this was no exception. price was reasonable and arrived within three day of placing the order.
B000C1UDR2|5|Smells nice and fresh a good everyday after shower cologne.  My husband loves it, and so do I.
B000G8LWZI|5|I've been using this product for a very long time and it is amazing...However, I suggest that if you purchase that it is fulfilled by Amazon.
B00GJ4X3MI|4|Not super soft but really nice!
B001441YM4|5|I ordered a few of the nets for work and they are perfect!
B0057AWRSG|5|I use this stuff like crazy. Now it is discontinued. I have to stock up big time.
B00DQ2ILQY|5|Ive never used these before always regular tweezers but these with the curve help alot more! Cuts on applying time.
B00AWR9HGO|5|Awesome!  I now only use ORS Hairepair products and my dry/curly hair has never been this manageable.
B000W3XG1K|5|For years I've tried all kinds of dandruff shampoos. From Neutrogena to Selsum Blue to Medical Grade by prescription only stuff. This Tee Tree oil is AMAZING. Two days of applying it and my scalp looks amazing and dandruff free. This product is worth every penny twice over. All natural. Perfect. Buy it.
B00BXPSH38|5|never used a wax with the brow powder. It was so easy to use and stays on all day.
B0045WDQFA|5|I really love this product! The smell is fantastic and it makes my hair feel wonderful!
B0080XTY42|2|I really like the look of this one but the bar is too bendable.  It would be perfect if it was not bendable. I wish the bar was stronger.
B00BJEOITU|4|Arrived quickly. Item as described. Thank you!
B000JLIHAU|5|Best Hyaluronic Acid Firming Serum out there as far as I am concerned. I love this stuff.
B00021PAQ6|5|Lancome rarely hits the mark with their frangrances.  Most are overpowering and way too sweet.  This classic scent was created close to the year of my birth (late 60's) and it is truly timeless. The scent is clean, crisp and subtle. Lancome's description of the fragrance as having hints of citrus, sandalwood and musk is spot-on. Don't let the musk scare you, it is barely there and just enough to subtley infuse the scent into your skin. I use it year round (even at the office)as it is just so fresh and clean. But those of you who prefer to change perfumes seasonally will enjoy this in the spring and summer months. I also suggest pairing the perfume with the body lotion(in the yellow tube), although it can be tricky to find. Sometimes you can find them as a set if you have the patience to dig around on the internet. Also, O de Lancome is no longer sold at the Lancome counters in department stores, so don't waste your time. You can buy it directly from Lancome's website or find a better deal here at Amazon, etc. Enjoy!
B000M86GAI|5|I love that it is not only environmentally friendly, but it is also an incredible moisturizing lipstick. It's very sheer color but you can use a lip liner for a little more pizazz. And we grew the wildflower seeds from the box! Fun and well worth the money. I have 3 shades, Nahinni, Sagarmartha, & Mariska. I prefer the more neutral Mariska.
B000JUV816|4|The conair hair dryer with brush attachment has been my favorite hairdryer for the last 20 years.  It makes it easy to straighten out my hair.  It really does the job.  The only (slight) problem with this version is that the brush attachment will slip off once in a while.
B004GSX31K|5|I use this for my dog a mini schnauzer and her hair around her chest legs and skirt get reall tangled and she used to snap growl you name it now with this she sleeps while I brush her
B0009OAH96|5|I ordered the item just before Christmas and received it in a timely manner. This cologne is wonderful. I would purchase from this vender again.
B003NUNRBS|5|My dermatologist recommended this product to me and I purchased a bottle from his office.  I will warn you, it has no perfumes and thus the smell is a little tough to get past.  I think the best description is having a freshly washed face licked by your dog.  ew!  But my doctor explained that the smell is because of the protein content.<br /><br />I was so pleasantly surprised to see a real improvement within a week of using this, and continued improvement there after.  The problem with this product, if you want to consider it a problem, it's effective, but expensive.  I'm on my third bottle and with the last bottle I was not quick about replacing it and went a month using other products.  My skin lost a lot of the firmness and clarity, so I'm back on it again.
B001VGORX8|4|Nice!
B0092MCMM6|4|Still going strong, hood is a little small.
B006RGM77K|5|This is my all time favorite conditioner. I want to try the other scents but I am just so addicted to this one. I love that it's all natural! I have yearned for an affordable product that encompasses all of my desires in a conditioner and Gud is absolutely it. It is not runny, nor too thick. It distributes evenly in my hair and leaving it in for just a few minutes drastically improves the way my hair looks and feels. I am Hispanic so I have thick, curly hair and constantly struggle to find ways to keep it moisturized. Burt's Bees &#34;Gud&#34; gives me a major head start in fighting frizz.
B00008BFXG|4|This new tooth brush takes a little getting used to, but it does a great job of cleaning your teeth even tho the sensation is a bit different.  you'll not go back to the old brush again!
B000JNQSIQ|5|This is my 3rd pair of wahl clippers 2 months I got these cuzz of the price plus my other 2 pair work so well the chrome pro wahl clippers and the yellow and black clippers but these are great to
B004Q6J8CU|5|Great size for traveling
B008CC4FHW|5|I have naturally straight hair but it sometimes gets frizzy. This shampoo and the accompanying creme have done a nice job of taking care of flyaways. I also enjoy the scent, very soothing.
B000EPA4FW|2|I was hopeful after reading some of the other reviews of this system that it might be less expensive, more effective than Proactiv. This was not the case for my skin. Maybe I was sensitive to some of the ingredients in the Neutrogena system or maybe it just didn't work for me, but either way ruptions began occurring when I used it. I noticed the pores on my nose seemed to be enlarging with continued use. I found that my skin did not feel clean after using the cleanser; as if a residue were left behind. The night cream seemed to get absorbed completely but the day cream remained slightly tacky feeling like it was sitting on top of my skin. I used the system a couple of weeks assuming that maybe my skin just needed to adjust - the eruptions didn't stop. I wish this had worked as it is a fraction of the cost of Proactiv.
B00O4DAAPY|5|Beautiful shine and thick coating!!! Love it
B00OAINK14|5|As a girl with oily skin, I am always on the lookout for products that will keep my makeup looking great all day.  I used to use primers and have tried virtually every drugstore brand, but after deciding I didn't  really like the way they felt on my face and not finding one that really performed how I wanted it to in the summer (where I have hot, humid, southern US weather), I began to entertain the idea of using a setting spray.  There are a few  already on the drugstore market but the parabens in E.L.F.'s version and the mixed reviews on NYX kept me from trying them (and I can't justify paying for the higher end brands).  When L'Oreal introduced this one, my interests perked and kept rising as I read the numerous great reviews out there.  I was convinced after having tried their Pro-Matte foundation; it's fabulous and really controls shine all day.  Although the setting spray is a bit pricey for the drugstore, there are often $2.00 off coupons in the paper and when buying at Wal-Mart the cost comes to around $12-13, so definitely worth trying in my opinion.<br /><br />I wore this on top of three different foundations: Physician's Formula (PF) NudeWear Touch of Glow Foundation, L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte Foundation, and Hard Candy Glamoflauge Foundation.  For all of my foundations I prepped with Lumene Bright Now BB Serum, and set with PF Organic Wear Loose Powder and E.L.F. Studio Translucent Setting Powder.  I applied the setting spray in the &#34;X&#34; and &#34;T&#34; motion after doing my face makeup but before applying eye makeup.  When it first went on it was so wet!  I was worried it wouldn't look right.  However it dried in a matter of minutes and gave slightly different effects.  For my PF formula, my face looked almost airbrushed (or as close as someone with oily skin, minor blemishes, and large pores can get)!  I loved how beautiful my skin looked.  On all of the foundations it gave a slightly dewy glow, but this seemed more pronounced on the L'Orealfoundation.  On top of Hard Candy, it looked satiny and smooth.  As for performance, it really keeps oil at bay all day.  A teeny, tiny bit of shine poked through around my t-zone, but it looked dewy rather than gross so it was ok by me.  At the end of the day, I could touch my face without coming away with that gross, greasy feeling.  It performed so much better than the primers I used!<br /><br />Overall, I love this stuff!  It leaves a slightly dewy glow on my skin but controls oil all day!  I don't have to worry about touch-ups at all.  It comes out in a mist and sets very quickly.  It's a little expensive compared to other drugstore setting sprays, primers, and foundations, but to me the price is worth it, especially if I can score a coupon in the papers.  And at 3.4 oz, I think it will last quite a while.  If you're in the market for a setting spray and want something that truly delivers on its promises, then I highly suggest checking this product out.  I'm waiting to find the new setting spray from Hard Candy to see how it compares (it's about half the price), but if I'm unsuccessful in that endeavor then this will definitely become a permanent fixture in my makeup routine.
B0001EL0CW|4|If you have sensitive skin this might be the soap for you to try. I ordered it on line because it was not available locally. This was a fair price for the item and I can recommend ordering this from Amazon.
B000NL0T1G|5|Everything about this razor is worth the money. I will probably have this for decades. Always properly clean and dry your razor after use!
B00A2ERDE0|4|Nice color for very pale skin.
B000E7YK5K|5|My husband loves it!!
B004N2EYY4|3|its okay just not what expected
B00F4SFIT6|3|very realist but the clip is just to heavy and big
B00B7QVERO|5|Good product, great price, fast shipping perfect!!
B005XP4YNQ|3|So-so
B005NWO9SE|5|Arrived very fast. Good quality
B004F4YYYU|2|The tattoo machine came with no instructions!!
B005DKKBUG|3|The base is pretty bad, I got 2 and both act really weird.<br />Sometimes it will get stuck in the dry cycle for over an hour
B001MHGVJY|4|Love that the wick is washable and a multiuse product, but dislike that the water fill pull out if small.  Hence why onlt 4 stars.
B00326GR9W|5|This produce keeps or re-hydrates your tobacco back to where it needs to be<br />for either cigarets or pipe tobacco
B000S8O3VQ|1|Like others said, within a few weeks two of the lids broke off and I too had to dump the pill case upside down to get pills out.
B001KYU9GA|5|Very calming and relaxing wonderful product
B0009X0TO0|1|The product is dried up and the tip breaks into pieces. Can do clean lines. Color was medium brown, not dark brown. Disappointing.
B004UT39DW|4|Great product, can make your hair oily if you use to much in one application so use sparingly. A little goes a long way.
B00C7DYBX0|5|I actually really like this.  It dries fully which is nice and I do think it at least temporarily improves the texture of my skin.
B006E9IZVM|5|Very good
B00MPG5ANY|5|Love them. Great brushes and a good selection of them.
B0001TSIB8|1|I've had psoriasis for a few years now, and recently discovered that the ingredients in the soap I was using could be making it worse, or even causing it. I promptly stopped using it and ordered this soap because it used all organic ingredients. For a week while I waited for my order to arrive I showered using water only, and after 3 days my psoriasis was completely gone. However, after 3 days of using this soap my psoriasis was back and worse than ever. I will not be ordering any more of this soap.
B00L9DUHQE|5|Wonderful product! So moisturizing,great for making DIY Body Butters!!!Aspen Naturals Cocoa Butter is amazing as well!!! Try them both!Excellent Quality!
B00NY5NGPE|5|Love it!!
B000FQ5OPK|5|Smells great...
B00CTPUOZU|5|This is a great product and the price exceptional! I have 63 year young skin but still oily in some spots. My skin looks smooth with a fresher look.  Easy to apply and no harsh reactions.  I've tried many serum in my days and this works as well or better than $50 plus serum! I always check Amazon 1st before I buy beauty products. Usually I find competitive prices plus Fast delivery along with superb customer service. Thank you Amazon!
B000C1VW6I|5|The only scent I wear. This product is long lasting, a little goes a long way and the scent lasts and lasts. I love it.
B00H93NJLS|4|As a moisturizer &#34;Organ Oil&#34; made my hair soft and controlled frizz, although it seems a little bit greasy. For a long time after bleaching my hair, it looked  frizzy, dry and damaged. Usually I use a little bit of olive oil to treat its dryness but now, I am done with dry and damaged hair :)
B00009RF1E|4|Great for some tasks, but not so much for others, such as trimming a beard to a certain length. But it's inexpensive and it works!
B00BU4K81Q|5|This moisturizer was recommended to me by a woman who does facials at a resort. I don't know if she is supposed to promote this line of skin care but she's used it on me twice. I bought it based on her recommendation as well as how I liked the way it felt after the facial. It's light but but an effective moisturizer. By that I mean that my face doesn't dry out or feel stiff, tight or heavy after using it and my skin feels moisturized for several hours after applied. My facial skin is a mixture of oily and dry and this product works well with it. I've tried lots of different moisturizers over the years and I've liked this one for a longer period of time than any other I've used in the past<br /><br />It's hard to recommend or not recommend this type of product because one's experience with moisturizers is something personal and dependent on skin type and what the user likes or doesn't like in a moisturizer. But I can say that I've been using this moisturizer for over a year and still love it.
B0058PIM5M|5|I have been using this cream for years, and it is terrific. It is effective, and it does help with my rosacea. When I use this before applying foundation, it does help tone down my red skin. It is worth the price.
B004Q1B5CG|4|Works great!  love it!

B00MVABJJI|5|Great Deal!  Hard toenails are so awful to deal with but these definitely make it easier!!
B000NDME6C|5|This is a great product, but too expensive on this site. I buy it elsewhere and save $25. per jar
B000FAE2J0|5|I used to use moisturizer from the pharmacy, but after trying this cream I'm never going back. I can just feel my skin drinking it up and holy crap does it make it soft. You might be thinking that $40 dollars is alot for moisturizer, but I feel like it's definitely worth it.
B0083S3MYC|3|When I was shopping in Paris a week ago, I found this exact product (same size) for 21 euros which was equivalent to about $27. Usually I find products abroad to be about 20% less than what I would pay here. I don't understand why this was so much more here when other Caudalie products do not have such an extreme price point difference.<br />As far as the product is concerned, I like it however, it isn't worth $49. Even $27 is a stretch for what it is.
B00CSTM3II|1|Blows
B001B82ADU|5|The individual sticks are a bit short - only 6&#34; are coated - but the scents are strong and lovely.  I use at least two per meditation.  Fortunately, there are 25 boxes to the pack so it will be a while before they run out
9790789157|2|did not smell as good as the lotion
B008OPK8EQ|1|Women are getting better results it seems, according to the reviews. It does not block DHT. I took it for 2 months and it made hair loss worse. They say losing hair in the beginning is normal, but with a little hair I have I don't wanna take any chances, I recommend those that are experiencing male pattern baldness should stay away from this, and stick to natural alternatives eg. apply extra virgin olive oil and leave it on overnight. Out of the million products I have tried, this is the only one that made the difference. In the long run it may even reverse my hair loss. I hope lol
B00B220ERY|4|Great product. Delivered on time as stated.
B001E768CC|5|I use this almost daily. It works well as a moisturizer and I've never gotten sunburned in the blazing Florida heat.
B00KCJRJI0|5|We use this brand only for my entire family. Its important for us to buy eco-friendly products...plus it cleans our teeth great
B0076JDHUI|2|I'll give it 2 stars because when I could get it to spray correctly I did have good luck with it working.  It never got sticky for me as I used it right after a shower.  I got some at DollarTree for a $1.00 so wasn't out that much money.  I would buy again if they redesign the can and put more product in the can.  It needs to be able to work at angles.  Best use may be feet but I used it on inner thighs in the Summer with no problem only getting the spray to function.  The product itself worked for me.  I say back to the drawing board and make it less pricey as there competition that makes it better and cheaper to use.
B00L2SWF7K|5|Love this moisturizer. I use it with Oz Naturals hyaluronic acid serum and I can see my skin tone has evened out after one week of use. And, I can see my skin continues to improve four weeks after use.
B000GIL0IW|5|excellent product
B00B4J0TKM|5|I was so surprised to find a package from San Francisco Salt Company on my porch over the weekend!  Inside I found some of their new [[ASIN:B00B4J0TKM Relaxing Epsom Salts with Lavender Essential Oil 2lbs, 100% Natural Bath Salt]].  If you haven't tried San Francisco Salt Company's spa-quality bath salts, you're in for a real treat.  Made from fine white crystals of 100% pure magnesium sulfate (epsom salts), these are nothing like the bath salts you buy at the drug store!  Scented with pure lavender essential oil, these particular salts also contain Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and Aloe Vera to soothe and heal your skin.<br /><br />Lavender is one of the best known of the essential oils used in aromatherapy, often used for easing muscle spasms, reducing inflammation and treating migraines, something I've been relying on it for for well over a decade.  Studies have shown lavender to reduce stress and relax brain waves and it has been traditionally used to ease insomnia and exhaustion.<br /><br />Here are some of my favorite ways to use these lovely bath salts -<br /><br />▶︎  Put a handful into your bath for a relaxing bath, perfect at the end of a long day<br /><br />▶︎  Ease sore and achey muscles by dissolving two handfuls in your bath and soaking for twenty minutes<br /><br />▶︎ If you are lucky enough to have a hot tub or jacuzzi, add a generous handful.  All of San Francisco Salt Company's bath salts are perfectly safe to use in your hot tub.<br /><br />▶︎ Add a handful to your foot spa for a relaxing treat - my favorite!<br /><br />▶︎ Mix a small amount with your shower gel.  You'll get both the benefits of the magnesium, which absorbs through your skin to ease achey muscles,  while the crystals exfoliate your skin<br /><br />Grandma's $0.02 -  [[ASIN:B00B4J0TKM Relaxing Epsom Salts with Lavender Essential Oil 100% Natural Bath Salt]] are marvelous for easing muscle aches while soothing winter-irritated skin.  Put this together with a loofah and a selection of bath tools for a wonderful gift!<br /><br />Highly recommendeda selection of bath tools for a wonderful gift!<br /><br />Highly recommended
B00B4Y4MSC|5|Gift for my daughter. She loved it.
B00R2L69EG|5|At first I was very skeptical.. why do I need to brush my teeth twice? This tastes kind of funny compared to the toothpaste I am used to...<br />I quickly overcame my skepticism after brushing.  My mouth has never felt so clean...like dentist clean (minus the painful scraping!).  I honestly didn't think it was possible for my mouth to feel this clean just from brushing my teeth.  The clean feeling (similar to the sensation of getting your braces off for the first time) lasted practically all day!  And bonus points for whitening better than any other toothpaste I've tried in the past!  Brushing my teeth with a two-step process doesn't take much more time than doing one step, and the results are incredible.  I would definitely recommend this product!
B00005JS5C|5|Great bikini shaver. Well designed.
B003TJ68KU|5|Best stuff ever!  Have bought 6 bottles already.  If you are looking for a cream that gives you a healthy shiny look to your hair this is it!  I put it on after I style my hair to give it a shiny healthy look!
B001A3HPT0|5|The shaving soap last a lot longer than a can of shaving cream. The lather is good and much less thick than cream so you can see what youre doing. Keeps my legs softer than the cream that dries them out after use.
B0015K9BXQ|1|I am a mother of 4 boys and taking them to get their hair cut is a dent in our budget so I saw these clippers and thought save 80 dollars once a month Had High hopes for this product. I pride myself on how my boys look and having a good haircut is one of those things. This product left a gap in my 4 year old's head he had to go bald,granted I thought it was from him moving around. Had to wait a day for it to charge up after one haircut and by the time my 14 year old son was gapped up and in need of a little trim on the sides this product was dead again so now my other two sons have to wait wow all around horrible experience with this clipper and will not be using it again on the lookout for another. Do not waste your money or time on this<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves you money and a trip to the barber<br />Cons<br />Low battery life doesn't last a full cut<br />doesn't cut even at all no matter how you use it<br />trimmer is awful all together if the battery last
B000L596FE|2|Did not observe any special detangling qualities,  it's an ordinary brush with short, fine bristles.  After brushing my granddaughter's hair several times there was quite a lot of hair in the brush, so it's either breaking it or pulling it out.  For wet hair, it seems the best solution is to use a wide tooth comb and a good detangling spray, and gently work from the bottom ends up.
B00FD3VJRC|1|This is the size of the freebies you get from the store when you make a larger purchase.
B0052ENGRS|5|This cream is the best.
B008ER2UNG|5|i wear it daily make me look more sexy then ever and pple ask how u get ur hair so long lol
B00ASHTV8C|4|On the day that I received the comb I began the combing therapy for my circulation.  I don't know how to measure that but my hair after one day is as soft as baby hair and it is normally long and kinked.  One problem, It lost two teeth already but for the price I cannot know whether that was my fault leaving it to fall.  Without the teeth at the handle, the ones left have made a huge improvement.  I usually have a comb full of hair.  Not a single thread.  But for the teeth falling out, it is a perfect tool.
B000056KK0|5|My husband has rosecea and acne and sun sensitivity.  He washes his face every morning and night then puts this on.  It is non-cosmetic (no oil to clog pores) and very moisturizing.  I've started using it every night after I wash my face and before I put on my heavy night cream.  It's an all over, light lotion that I even put on my eyelids.
B004SGKMA0|3|Derby has been my go-to blade for a long time. I find them the right balance of smoothness and effectiveness -- and at the right price. But I recently bought the 100 pack from this site, and I was shocked and disappointed. Of course, I haven't tested all 100 of them, but all of the nine or ten I have tried so far have been defective. It is probably enough to conclude that I got a rotten batch. One of the edges is completely fine, but the other is rough and chafing. How can a company that makes such a fine product have such poor quality control?<br /><br />  This experience has inspired me to buy a variety pack and see if I can find an even better alternative.
B00462IFS2|3|I would've like to have loved this but the product was old. I can't really say how it would perform if it was fresh. It was unopened, just smelled old.
B0017QDKDA|1|I searched high and low for a \\"banana clip\\" like the one I've had since junior high and I am 37 now. These clips are the perfect length. The problem is the side that is to be opened and closed has a little bitty ball on it so it NEVER grabs and stays closed. I have thick hair, however as you see from my first sentence I have managed to have the same clip practically my entire life and never broke that or had one issue. I am very disappointed in this purchase and since I had to open it to find out it will never be used I can't do anything with them.
B004GLRS5Y|5|Honestly love this Day Cream.  I've been using it now for about 5 years --&#62; Consistency is perfect!!!  I mix it will a little bronzer in the summer months for a warmer color and get many compliments!!!  I would highly recommend to anyone considering!!!
B001SERK9G|5|Love!
B00MF7321A|4|I received this for consideration for review.<br /><br />OZ Naturals Natural Sunscreen is okay for a natural mineral sunscreen. I find that the levels of Zinc Oxide and Titanium Oxide are a little on the low side for my preference and I don't trust it for very long wear in direct sun. But for day to day protection, out running around, to and from my car, under makeup and so on, it does a pretty nice job keeping the harsh rays of the Arizona sun from burning my fair skin. I would give this five stars if the Zinc Oxide number were higher.
B006X1H2P6|5|The delivery time was excellent, it was well packaged and precisely as described. A good company to deal with. The clipper is easy to hold in a woman's smaller hand in my opinion.
B009HULKLW|5|I have never used this product before or it's rival. But I love them already. they were easy to use for a beginning naturalista. Not to bad to sleep in either.
B00MXD563S|5|I think I'm going to love this stuff!
B002CVTVW8|4|I haven't had a cavity in 10 years since using Sonicare. These new heads work the same, but I am skeptical of eliminating my flossing routine.
B003O86ZRW|4|Ordered this product from 101 Medical Spa via Amazon. Arrived before predicted date! Product does have a \\"mediciny\\" smell but you only need to use a VERY small amount! Only used a bean sized amount and was able to wash face, neck, and chest in the shower! Good value if it works, time will tell! Also bought Obagi Vitamin C serum, exfoliating lotion, and sunscreen.
B0007X74CW|1|i have really hard water and it didn't help at all.  makes your hair feel really clean and smell good but did nothing for helping to remove the rust and calcium build-up.  also had crappy customer service.  there was a mix up in the mail and i originally paid for shipping and i finally received it 2 weeks later than what i was told. and i never received the 1st original bottle.  the seller was ez to get a hold of and they told me to let them when i received the &#34;lost bottle&#34; and the 2nd one they sent out.  needless to say i only received 1 bottle 2 weeks later.  will never ever buy from them again
B00158N0W6|4|Feels good when you apply but it is too costly for the amount you get.
B0010SXGJ8|5|My use of Tuscany goes back to my college days.  I could never afford the cologne as a student so when I went home for the holidays I would put some of my Dad's in a film canister and take it back with me.  I just recently confessed this to him.  Anyway I found this Tuscany set at a great price here on Amazon and couldn't pass it up.  It is the first time I tried their aftershave and it is nice especially when the wife snuggles up and comments how good I smell.  The cologne smells the same.  Great!
B000NG69EW|5|I purchased this color at a local store and just wanted to review it here because it is gorgeous. It is a nude-like shade; however it is very much an opaque peachy-pink color. It is similar to Essie's A Crewed Interest but much more pigmented! If you are looking for a go-to Spring/Summer shade... this is it!
B00MX5W9TK|4|not worth $100+.  Dont smell that great.
B00517W45G|5|Use it everyday, amazing
B007GMJ9WA|5|I never wore an eyelid primer until I tried elf's brand and I love it.  I now can't go without it!  It makes such a huge difference with my eyeshadow staying on and in place during the day!  Also, I was kind of hesitant to order this because it wasn't through prime but I did anyway and I actually got it on the exact same day as my prime products that were two day shipping!
B000B5UPF4|4|I am a forty year old woman with very oily skin.  I have tried the smashbox and Dermadoctor versions of this, and I think this is the best.  It doesn't go white at the edges like the Smashbox, and doesn't pill with makeup over like the Dermadoctor.  It lasts for a couple of hours, then my skin shows the shine again.  So not a miracle worker, but a good product until something better (hopefully) gets invented to make my oily skin go away!
B004GVFKFY|4|Very hard to find.  It was what my Dad used to keep handy, but that was 40 years ago.  NIce to know it was still available when I myself needed it.
B003VGMLSO|4|I had seen this on pentrest so I had to buy it. It is very sheer had a hint of pink shimmer.  It worked well when I was having surgery and could not have a dark color on my nails.
B003YMJJSK|5|I've recently developed a lot of trouble with allergic dermetittis around my eyes. Even when I'm not experiencing a reaction my skin is so dry and flakey. I switched to cerave products and it had helped tremendously. The price on amazon is fantastic and I can keep one on the sink and one in the shower.
B003WMV2FA|5|I started using this product several years ago. It is gentle, smooths the skin, and does not dry.  However, I cannot justify paying $26.+ at dept. stores. This is a great price from a great seller. I also like that the scrub is in a tube instead of a jar. The jar lid kept chipping off every time I dropped it in the shower. Will buy again from this company.
B00CWDBMSM|4|Amazing product for the price!  Just started using and noticed my complexion is smoother!
B000P9B3SO|5|I have been disappointed not to be able to find this product in the store recently and so I had to order it online.  It not only helps remove tangles very well but also it conditions my hair and makes it shiny and healthy looking.  My grandchild has long hair and no other product I have found works as well as John Frieda Sheer Blonde Healthy Attitude Leave in Spray 8oz for removing the tangles.
B000MAPB7A|4|Oasis is the best product that I have found so far for nocturnal dry mouth. It provides a pleasant, long lasting spray for the mouth.
B00B76ALVO|5|I purchased this to replace a very old straightener.  I had tried once before and bought another expensive product that failed abysmally to straighten my hair, just made it frizzy after much work.  I was skeptical, but purchased this straightener based on other reviews.  I would definitely recommend it.  It has worked perfectly for a couple of months now.  It makes quick work in the morning of my thick, coarse, long Hispanic hair and never leaves it frizzy.  The oil sample that came with the straightener is nice, but not absolutely necessary.  It does tame the odd fly-aways when needed though.
B00EL27QQ4|5|Thumbs up
B000U24NGK|5|I have been using Jane Carter for a couple years now & this is really great for adding shine and adding a great refreshing scent to hair.
B0036B75W6|4|Got this as I'm pregnant and this has fewer chemicals. Pasha #280 is more of greyish pewter. Like it so far and hold on good for about a month. Would purchase Zoya in the future
B007RG6ZF4|5|The dispenser is very handy. I keep it by the door to pump a handful as I leave in the morning. Keeps me freckle-free.
B00JZ0L7VC|4|We used it on our 3 yr. old grandaughters rats nest, it's no miracle worker but with a lot of work and detangler spraying it finally turned out quite well. If used everyday we would never have a problem, but when you let it go, wow, what a job.
B000C214FG|5|My mom has been searching for this perfume for a while now but wasn't able to find it in stores. I was so happy to find it on Amazon! It came fairly fast. I got it five days after I placed the order. The real test was when my mom tried it though. She says it's the perfume she remembers and still loves it! It has a sweet powdery smell and it's not something I gravitate towards but if you been searching for it this is the real thing! Would buy this again.
B00ES0Z206|5|Cleans and exfoliates. Like it a lot.
B005TVSIQS|3|gift
B003WR3QSG|5|best brush i have, will be getting more
B00NN3UY2U|1|No tracking number. Lost in transit. Peacock flew south for the winter
B008O4YM76|5|Arrived quickly. New in package. It's a hairbrush, and it brushes hair.
B008RIJVTI|1|it's not that great my finger doesn't fit in it .and I don't think it works that great I don't like it  but I put it on my face
B00KA5R3KU|3|Smallish, but gets the job done.
B00756HQNQ|5|I bought this to remove thick dead skin on the ball of my feet.<br /><br />Pumice stones are slow and hard work. But this was very quick, and easy to use. My feet haven't felt this good in 30 years.<br /><br />If the Microplane loses its sharpness, I'll update this review.
B00BCVS5SK|5|I am 61 years old, fair skinned red head.  40 years ago I spent considerable time in the sun as farm boy even a lifeguard.  Today that sun damaged skin from 40 years ago is developing \\"actinic keratosis\\", small red spots that flake on my face.  Two spots developed into basil cells that had to be surgically removed.  The actinic keratosis is sometimes cryogenically (frozen) off.  I have also been treated with a harsh chemical imiquimod \\"Zyclara\\".  I've had the opportunity to use your Utopian H2O2 night cream for a week now. It was given to my wife, but I tried it using a small amount on my face at night and in the morning.  It is healing the scaling skin nicely.  It also, maybe is drawing out the actinic keratosis in a similar manner as the imiquimod.  What is very encouraging is my daughter-in-law thought looked noticeably younger on father's day.
B00KXMM7Z6|5|When your funds are as tight as mines, this lovely duo will do just fine. Not only were they priced right for the set, they are sturdy as well. I highly recommend this fantastic set for any couple thats on a budget, but would like to get a nice set of band rings as a token of their love. This is a very good idea. Thank you, sincerely, Juanita Wilson...
B009V87LUE|3|I ordered this because my coworker swears it thickens and lengthens her hair.  I have been using it for a few months now and it does make my hair shiny and soft, but I haven't noticed and growth or thickness change.
B004JVWUK4|5|Prefer metal files and for some reason, they are so hard to find.
B00AAJOZN4|5|I got purple! Feels so goooood!
B00CHHL1AW|5|Exactly what I had in mind.
B00DRZRWOW|4|Very adequate eyebrow pencils for the price. A good color for cool blonds and while not soft, not uncomfortablely hard either.
B001CYRV64|5|Excellent product
B002Z7FRT0|5|First, Lancome Hypnose Mascara covers my lashes well.  I get longer, thicker looking lashes without clumping. It stays on all day and night.  I use a mascara remover to remove it at night.<br /><br /> I had tried several mascara brands and had allergic reactions.  Lancome mascara does not give me an allergic reaction.
B00OZ02WA2|5|I've been coloring my hair at home with permanent blue black hair dye continually for the past 10 years. Now I've decided to grow out my natural color (medium brown), and decided to try a color remover to help with the process. I tried Color Oops a few months ago which slightly lifted the roots only, to be honest it was quite disappointing. After waiting several months I decided to give JoBaz a try and was shocked when I saw my reflection in the mirror. My color has been drastically lightened, I'd say by about 70% ! The tones look very natural and soft, just what I was hoping for. It's not totally back to my natural color with a few coppery reds in there  that I didn't originally have but is pretty close. I'm certain that when I go to work tomorrow I'll get comments because my hair color has lightened so dramatically, in fact it's a real surprise for me to see how light my hair used to be because I'd been dyeing it black so long that I had forgotten. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to remove the build up of long term, permanent dark hair dyes in their hair. God knows how many dye jobs were built up in my hair but it certainly did its job. Thanks JoBaz!
B00GTXB51K|4|has a nice smell.  makes my skin feel soft and not dry.  but doesn't get as dark as I prefer.
B00JFRBSJ6|5|This worked well on a nail that had been damaged and then became infected. It was very simple to use and worked quickly. I highly recommend it.
B005G9LPDQ|5|Love, love, love this color. I'm fair skin and is a really natural tone on my lips if going for a natural look. The delivery was real fast = )
B0014R2YRA|1|I had high hopes for this product after reading the other reviews, but I was disappointed. I tried using this every night for one month and only saw a minimal difference. I have used products that worked in the past, this brand doesn't work!
B00023IXMC|5|My husband has a collection of colognes but this one somehow is his favorite.  He had an old one that had maybe 2 drops in it and as I was going to toss it out he looked at me as if I was going nuts - he was saving it for a &#34;special occasion&#34; as he can no longer find it.  I found it on amazon at a GREAT price so got it for him, it is the ORIGINAL cologne. Smells GREAT!
B00MNMQKPC|4|Really great brushes! I am not very talented when it comes to doing fancy things with makeup but these brushes helped so much!
B003Z2J5W4|1|I thought I was getting 2 for the amount I paid and got one. Lesson learned...
B003B1YS94|5|Best on market I love it I use it daily
B007ZU1O12|5|The bulbs arrived very quickly and are perfect!
B0068OAL2E|5|Love this fragrance. It's strong and subtle at the same time. Very elegant.
B0037MKHBA|1|I have used this product before and it was a thicker liquid. This tube has very thin liquid and almost seems watered down. It is a great product but this particular tube isn't the best. Sorry! It was priced well and arrived on time. Good seller, weird primer.
B0038IA8XA|5|Super strong and made my nails last longer!! I heard about this product from a friend and I'm happy I got it! Make sure you apply it in thin coats
B004DN7VPW|5|Work as expected
B001NT9RG0|5|i have loved this lotion since i started tanning at 14 (im 25) it works great
B008B2Z94Q|5|Awesome beauty blender
B004M1BO3U|4|My dentist recommended this product and after much research I decided to buy it. I was very impressed with the difference I feel when I brush and how clean I feel my teeth are. I'm hoping that my dentist will agree on my next check up! Btw, I just saw the same brush at Walmart for $69!!!
B00GI7EYU6|5|Lovely subtle fragrance, lasted at least 6 to 9 months!
B0048JFLNU|5|Love using this at night for aching muscles!!
B0094GHL62|2|I heard so many great reviews of this mascara, I just had to try it. All it did was crumble off and get in my eyes all day. I don't believe I've ever had a problem like that with any other mascara I've tried, and CERTAINLY not to this extent. It's the first mascara I've ever trashed instead of just letting it bury itself in the bottom of the drawer. To its credit, it looks great when it goes on.<br /><br />Edit: I wish I had looked at the low-star reviews before I bought this. Seems like I am not alone in getting mascara crumbs in my eyes.
B009CZR3Y0|5|Love it - its light gelish and non-sticky and it last forever!!! Definitely will order next time.
B0013SQHRS|5|I had previously bought a sampler pack of Dali for men and this was my favorite ( and my girl's too) so I was glad to find a larger size available.  Chick magnet.
B003BMGAUI|5|Great lotion, it smells really nice and feels nice on your skin UNLESS you have an open cut like a popped pimple or something like that. It will sting a bit, but not too bad. Also, this might not be the best lotion for someone with dark skin that's prone to hyperpigmentation, because hte AHAs make you sensitive to the sun and the skin will darken faster. So use this under a sunscreen if you want the benefits of an AHA in a mild form, but also want adequate sun protection. Would probably recommend that for lighter skinned people as well since sun protection is important.
B000S1C9X2|5|I love it.
B004M1BO3U|5|My wifes overpriced Dentist had been recommending that she purchase a sonic toothbrush that his office sold at, in his words, \\"a lower price than you can find anywhere\\". I called and asked a receptionist to give me the product name and model number and proved the sadistic bastard wrong by simply going to Amazon, finding the product and hitting \\"buy\\".<br />I guess its a good product. I still use the regular old toothbrush. The wife loves it though and thats all that matters.<br />So, in the future, don't believe anything your Dentist tells you.
B00MJ0N6FA|5|The colors are very pretty!  This eyelash curler is very well constructed and will last FOREVER!  It's easy to use and fits well on my hands. It doesn't get stuck on my finger and thumb like my old pair did.  Have already recommended to friends and family!  The users guide was helpful and love that it comes with a travel bag.
B0049LUI9O|5|I bought this for my husband when he asked for a noise hair trimmer for Christmas. (We're such romantics! Ha!) He was thrilled with this little trimmer and has used it with great success and he's also happy that I won't be ripping out anymore stray ear hairs! It trims well and you can hear it cutting the hair. He's used it on nose, ears, shaping eyebrows and even to keep his sideburns cleaned up. The end part does get a little warm if it's been running for a minute or two but doesn't feel like it's something that will hurt you.
B001G7PLVE|5|Great product.  Can only find it on Amazon.
B008HBMVZ6|4|smells not good.
B008R54IQM|5|I bought this on Sep 5th 2013, the switch is not working anymore, it got broken in less than a year
B0051E3426|5|This is the good stuff. A Lil difficult to maneuver initially, but then it became a breeze. It makes lovely loose curls. Go out n get it. Save yourself from hot curling
B005TPVLEU|5|This is the best. I agree with all the other posts left about Cortex and I would like to add I love the shampoo as well. There is nothing that has made my hair so soft and nice looking, even after blow drying it straight. This stuff is amazing!!!! I just wish it was easier to find. I have used redken, biolage among other high end products and nothing has ever worked like cortex. I have even used it on my daughter who is 8 and I can see a difference in her hair when I have used it on her. It just looks healthier and more to life. So I recommend this product if you have frizzies and dry hair.
B0001209OO|2|It comes with everything you need; it's easy to use and gentle on the face. But, it does not give a close shave no matter how many times I go back and forth over areas. I feel like it leaves me with the equivalent of about 12 hours growth after a good close shave.<br /><br />I see that many reviewers have said that it does give a close shave- It must depend on what you're used to. This was my first experience with an electric shaver. I normally use a 5 blade \\"sensor\\" hand held razor so maybe my idea of a close shave is different from what you look for in an electric model.<br /><br />Anyway, it is easy to use.
B003SJ0FSW|1|I was expecting a lot from this Lactic Acid partly because of the reviews I saw at the time, and partly because it was marked as 85%. I thought it would be very strong but I felt nothing. It was basically like putting water on my skin. Nothing happened. I waited 20 minutes and still nothing. I didn't even wash it off because it was absolute garbage. Yesterday I decided to try again on a different part of my body, but nothing happened. *Sigh* I highly doubt this lactic acid is even anywhere near 10%. It honestly feels like nothing. Maybe I got a bad bottle? I don't know but I am sorely disappointed. I'd give it zero stars if I could. Be careful when you buy this brand.
B007FAOQOO|5|Pretty!
B00JXQ06X8|5|This is perfect for curly hair. The difuser piece gets popped in when you receive it and it does not fall out! Its there to stay. I love this product!
B000L978FU|2|This stuff just barely works. And believe me when I say that I'm not someone who has to be squeaky clean all the time. I gave this stuff about three weeks to see if it would eventually work. I followed the directions exactly.<br /><br /> The bottom line is that (believe it or not) I can smell a hint of BO the instant I put this stuff on my underarms. I thought I was imagining it the first time or two but within a few hours, I can smell the unmistakable odor from several inches away. And I'm not even a really sweaty type of person. My guess is if you put this stuff on and went into work, people would be able to smell you from several feet away by lunch.<br /><br /> I'm really not being overly critical here. I wanted to like this product. I bought it because the clear gel antiperspirant I have been using for years was really starting to irritate my skin. This stuff doesn't. But it barely even works so I guess I'll have to keep looking. This product costs way too much for what it does. I would only buy this if you insist on something more \\"natural\\" and/or you need something that won't irritate your skin. If you can live with a little BO and you're willing to shower at least twice a day, you might like it.
B00FH692PQ|5|I like the lightness of this product. The smell is ok, but would like a bit of a citrus or floral scent
B000U7S07S|5|I absolutely love this waterproof eyeliner. I have a lot of allergies and my eyes water a lot. This eyeliner doesn't budge. It takes a little time to get used to applying it but it stays until you take it off. I use Mary Kay make up remover and it comes off easily. The shipping cost was outrageous though! If I didn't have so much trouble finding the color I like, I would've NEVER paid that much!
B00B4TR3KG|5|Great cologne and much cheaper than retail stores. g-
B006LCFM68|5|The case was easy as can be to put on.  It fit perfectly.  It makes the player less likely to slip as well as provides a bit of protection from unintended collisions.  Excellent so far.  No problems.
B00ZDU6RPY|5|I'm always looking for the next fun thing to up my look. Who doesn't want fuller lip?! I wouldn't recommend it for those with somewhat full lips like mines but it was fun to try and it does work!<br /><br />Make sure you clean it properly before hand. It does take a few tries to get the right type of suction and I only kept it on for 30 seconds. I did see noticeable fullness, especially after putting on the lip balm! Mans the balm smells so nice!<br /><br />I received this product for testing purposes. My thoughts are of my own and have no been influenced by any outside sources.
B004R6HIR6|5|This is a great product.  The creamy texture allows for good dispersement of product.  It can go a long way. I am fair skinned and the tint in the cream works perfectly for me and actually replaces my foundation with just a touch of powder.  It leaves my skin flawless and at age 64 this is very important.
B001CT053U|5|The smell is clean and sexy, masculine for sure, with woodsy and mildly sweet under-tones.  My only objection...Smells great but its appealing aroma is gone way too soon!  My husband smells wonderful when he wears it and so does the immediate environment where he sprays.  It's a delicious cloud of \\"come hither!\\"  Love it!
B003U54P1W|5|What just what I know it was and very happy with the product.  I hope i can keep finding more?
B000Q8ISXM|5|Good stuff...works
B000FFI228|5|I have curly hair, this dryer Is my 3rd and 4th. I had to buy two. I can not imagine not having this dryer or being without one. I've used this dryer for years!!
B005UKZAJG|5|Good product
B00STU8EM4|5|I love this product! It smells exactly like cucumbers. After using this my skin feels very hydrated. The gel has a slight cooling sensation. It makes your skin feel awake and refreshed. Few of my favorite ingredients are Hyaluronic acid & VITAMIN E. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects and repairs your skin. It has a very beneficial effect in helping prevent the signs of premature aging. Hyaluronic Acid helps to produce collage which reverses the signs of aging. I mentioned some of the wonderful ingredients that I love in this product. The gel is also 100% natural with organic ingredients. This product does not contain parabens, sulfates or alcohol. I really love using this eye gel every day. I have seen my wrinkles and under eye dark circles reduce. If you love eye gels, I guarantee you will fall in love with this one!
B005XBMA2M|1|Was really excited to try these out; unfortunately then the quality was poor. Maybe I got a bad batch? The strips had a hard time separating from the little curved base bit, and when they did, many of them curled back onto themselves, making them unusable. Others tore vertically. I'm a long-time user of nail polish strips and I've never had a problem like this using other brands. I won't be rebuying Incoco.
B000G82YNM|4|I looked for this for years because it is no longer available in my area stores.<br />I love the fragrance, very light and like sweet herbs, not perfumy.<br />Does a decent job as a conditioner also.<br />This will last me forever.
B0031AA5NS|4|As described, it is dual voltage so it requires only an adapter, NOT a voltage converter for use outside of the US. It curls really well and packs easily-- great for travel. Straightening is fine but not great-- I used it mostly for fixing frizz/flyaways while on vacation rather than actually straightening my hair (it's not quite big enough or hot enough for that)
B002VRPXNO|3|I've bought this cologne before from department stores and loved it. It seemed to me that this bottle didn't have as potent a smell as the aboved mentioned bottles that I had bought.
B00FVGS3W0|1|Basically they're all concealer brushes
B004CQ710U|4|I bought this product a few weeks ago and I'm very pleased.  I wasn't expecting a miracle but it has helped the puffy eyes that I seem to have on a regular basis.  Now when I wake up and remove my patches my skin is 100% less puffy and smooth.  They are comfortable to sleep in. I hardly notice they are on.    Just remember the area under your eyes is very thin and sensitive, so removing the patches there, must be done slow.  I learned the hard way- ouch!   I will be purchasing these again!
B002TTPA46|3|At approximately $1.33 each for these hair clips, you get what you pay for. The flowers are very pretty, but the clip could be much better.  The clip is essentially a cheap alligator clip that isn't designed to be used on hair.  The clip is about 1 inch in length, although the flower is about 3 inches in length. The flower sits up very high (almost too high) off of the clip and your head.  If they were somewhat flatter, they would look much better.  Overall though, these are cute.  The foam flowers look real and are nicely colored.
B00AYORYFG|5|perfect item
B0086BAV4K|1|got it and it doesn't work.... works for 3 seconds then quits , has no power .. waste of my money
B0006PJSLQ|5|Pure heaven. This scrub smells divine and works great. I live in a very dry area (desert) and this scrub really moisturizes my skin. You just need a quarter size scoop to get great results. Compared to drug store brands, this scrub costs nearly the same but the quality is far superior. I will be buying this product again for myself and to give as a gift.
B00RFW4X7M|5|This gadget is amazing! Especially for the price. My ONLY complaint is that it really sucks the juice out of batteries.
B00F5T6HPS|5|love the rich deep purple
B0085K6NXA|5|it has kind of a flowery smell to it i have tried other spray for woman but all and all i love it i would buy it again i would rate this a ten if they had enough stars lol
B00JH3K6DM|5|For the price you can't beat it. The brush is softer then the original clarisonic brush, but I actually like it better. I have sensitive skin and I feel like it is better for my skin. It's a great product.
B003N1WS9O|5|This is wonderful moisturizing lotion with an incredible fragrance. The soap and perfume in the same fragrance are great also.
B006E7WV82|4|I read the ingredients, and since it looked like just a bunch of different oils and scents, I started using it on my lips. It actually works really well. I like it on my cuticles too, but I'm more of a lip product junkie. I usually just get my cuticles done when I get manicures, but I do sometimes bring this along and have them do my nails with this. It smells clean and works well.
B00I84FR76|5|Love it, everything in there comes in handy and its for a great price !!
B0071P4M4C|5|Love this stufff!! I put it on anything that needs moisturizing and it works great (especially great for razor irritation). I would recommend this to anyone looking for a propolis based moisturizer.
B000RZLL38|4|I have owned several wall mount dryers and they seem to be chintzy - overly small and too hot, way too hot to dry my kids' hair.  This one is a bit bigger, feels great in the hand and has a little switch you can set to make it run either warm or hot.  My kids no longer scream and yell when I dry their hair.  It has plenty of power and it looks good too.  The only drawbacks are the length of the cord (could be a tad longer), and the back vent sometimes pulls a hair or two - neither are deal breakers.  I'm very happy with this dryer.
B00HBISPME|5|Eyes were feeling hot, dry and very itchy; was diagnosed with extreme dry eye and demodex. This product is great. First few times it stings and skin around eyes is red, but then by the end of week my skin had adjusted - no sting, no redness - just cool, clean feeling and no itch. Will definitely keep using it.
B00MX2KXE6|5|Bought these for my staff at work, they're not bad for the price!
B00EA4MQ72|4|(Review for yellow, citrus packet) I was really surprised that these clean the way they do. The 'wipes' are thin sheets, with no bumps to offer any scrubbing action. I was very skeptical but it does work. A single sheet can clean my oily face, heavy foundation and eye liner. And as advertised, no rinsing required. It doesn't leave skin too dry the way most cleansers do. Love the light, citrus scent. The packet reseals itself once opened, so a great option to take on trips.
B0010CBGFA|5|love it
B00D3G6JAS|5|whitens teeth like you went to the dentist and charged u a huge amout
B00CE2JC9W|1|I used it religiously in saw 0 results I'm so tired of falling for gimmicky products because of excessive reviews
B005KAO02O|5|smells great, great price
B00A7H8ECW|4|I HATE the plastic versions. I use this to separate my eyelashes between coats of mascara and it works STUPENDOUSLY, in addition, I use it to groom my brows as well. Please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and get this instead of the plastic cheap ones. It will last much longer. My only dislike is the color, I would have preferred plain silver or black instead of the pink/purple colors that the real techniques colors come in. Yes, Im a woman, but not all of us adore these outrageous colors. Simplicity = better,
B000TX5UCG|5|I bought this product because I wanted a curling iron small enough to leave cute little curls in my 3 year old daughter's hair. This worked out perfect. I'm amazed at how well the curls stay in the hair and how easy it was to curl it. There's a high and low setting. I use the low setting for her because I don't want to burn her hair. Even after only a few seconds in her hair on low, her hair came out looking beautifly curled. For her being such an active child, I was surprised that the curls lasted all day without any hairspray. I'm glad I spend the money on this product.
B000RZYIN8|5|I have naturally wavy/curly hair that usually needs a lot of product to keep my curls bouncy.  This is the first product that I have used that works all by itself.  My hair wasn't crunchy! It had a lot of body and great curls.  I took it to work for my coworker to try it.  Her hair is a lot curlier that mine.  She loves it too!  I can't wait to try the other products.
B005JPOBEC|4|Nice scent, but very very light.
B007TPQHVU|5|People think I am crazy but this stuff really is the best you can find! Great anti-perspirant and deodorant roll-on. It is hard to find in stores and you will find that if they do carry it, it is often out of stock..... That is because people who know how great it is, buy it up. As you can see, I didn't mess around and purchased a pack of 18!!! I have 2 boys and I can honestly say they are not at all stinky!
B000C1VX6M|5|This is a very good cologne.  I will use it all the time.  smells very nice.  Women love it very much.
B003H6FPVI|5|To the uninitiated in epilator use, it does what it says it does. And yes, it hurts, but like another reviewer said, it can be addicting when you see the results. As someone with fast-growing hair and sensitive skin, daily shaving in the summer is no fun. The initial \\"ouch\\" of this gets less and less each time I use it. (It hurts most around the ankles and the fleshy part of your calves. Underarms hurt too, but if you have ever given birth ... even with an epidural, you can definitely do this.)    Because individual hairs grow at different rates, don't expect to use this and get silky smooth skin the very first time. It takes a few days. And yes, if you have pale, sensitive skin like me, you'll get lots of little red dots all over your legs from where the device yanked out the hairs, so don't plan a trip to the pool as soon as you finish. For me, those dots fade in less than 24 hours.    I tried an Epilady once back in the early 90s and determined it was an especially cruel form of torture invented by men who didn't like women. But, this is much better. It's different technology from the epilators of 20 years ago. I researched and read just about every review on this site for every epilator that got an average four stars, and then went to the store with the big red bull's eye and bought this one (for about the same price listed here).    Pros: As for this particular epilator, I love that it can be cordless. It comes partially charged, but you really should charge it up before using it. It works better/faster if you use it while plugged in. The two different removable head sizes are also convenient.    Cons: Because of the contour of the head, this epilator is specifically designed for legs, even though it says it's for other areas as well. It is a little loud, but nowhere near as loud as a hair dryer.    Overall, I would buy this product again and I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Considering the amount of money I'll save to not buy razors, shaving cream,not to mention the time I'll save every day, this is definitely a great investment.
B00UW2S0BW|1|worked but barely
B005C4Y65Y|5|Good lotion for my dry hands, is one of the best lotion the market ! I really love it !!
B003JMYU20|4|After reading all the reviews I didn't buy it here, but headed over to local Sally's at the suggestion of another reviewer. The price is really not that significantly different I have to say. But once I was there I committed myself to getting it. I have pretty long hair and was concerned to get the right curl-formers to fit my length, since I read that they might be not long enough. My hair is about mid-back length so I ended up not getting the set, but 3 sets of extra-long and wide ones, just to be sure.  And I was right. This length accommodated my length and would work even for a bit longer hair. It's pink and orange color ones.<br />The curlers do produce very nice curls very easily, but at first it's tricky. You do have to practice. The very first time, my curls had gaps, because after pulling the hook out the former just didn't want to fall back to it's original shape. I don't know why. Is there a trick to it? Do you have to twist the hook in some way while pulling it out? I will practice more and post an update if I figure a trick.<br />Sleeping with them is a challenge too. Not comfortable at all. But it's optional, so I am not going to go into it.<br />Curls, however, are very pretty and based on the fact that this type of curl forming doesn't involve any chemicals or hair damage, it's a great invention for sure.
B009TWF80M|5|I will probably use this for the rest of my life.
B00EZDSEV0|5|A WONDERFUL PRODUCT I DID SOME TATTOOS WITH THE BUTTERFLY PATTERNS THEY CAME OUT GREAT
B00AAJOZN4|5|If you're looking for a quality pair of tweezers, this is your ticket. Made of good quality. Very effective for precision plucking. Great value for the money. Even comes with its own little case. I was lucky enough to receive mine in hot pink, the very color that I wanted!
B007NL5GBW|3|was easy to apply, and it stayed on alright. however, the color was not as bright or vibrant as the video on their website advertised.<br />shipment came in time for halloween. For a halloween costume, it's alright.
B0009OAGTM|5|I love this perfume.  It has a light, pleasant scent.  This perfume is a good choice if you prefer a lighter perfume.
B008M90L46|5|I Smell Awesome.
B0002PU86O|5|This wax works really well and it gentle on the skin. I would recommend it if you want to do your own wax job
B0011UR1H8|5|This is my favorite tanning lotion.. I love the smell.. I don't know if it actually helps me tan faster, but it definitely helps keep my skin moisturized and smelling nice :) I have tried many other tanning lotions in the past, but nothing compares to this!
B00QXIDW2G|5|This is nice and smooth! My hubby loves using it after a shave
B002TSA91Q|5|Purchased this product, which I'll have for about 5 years, on the recommendation of my dermatologist.  A little goes a long way and it is easy on my dry skin.
B00CTNQOHO|2|I am very disappointed with this nail polish.  This picture makes it look like a tan/light brown color.  IT IS NOT!  It is a very dark purplish/mauve color. You would think that with a name like Tutu MOCHA it would be a brownish color, but it is not.
B004B8AZH0|1|was not happy with the quality...seems like these were the razors that could not meet the retail quality specs.....first use they hurt to to use, I've tried 6 of the 12 razors and they all are no good.
B005V4SIKO|2|This product is disappointing.  I specifically ordered it because it was a Vidal Sassoon product.  The material is so thin that it hardly absorbs the water from my very fine, thin hair.  Definitely not worth the price.
B004I797VO|5|Seems great and is very mild, as compared to other flavors or Tom's.
B000FL9AMS|5|I have used this product before and loved it. It has shine,but not too much,the colors are great. I also put it on top of other lipsticks, it adds dimention to them. I wouldn't live without it.
B00OP25LBW|4|The scent of the shampoo is amazing. I don't know what turkish figs smell like, but I like the scent. It has fruity, floral, and clean smell to it. I've tried using the shampoo by itself and with the conditioner in this line. I must say, it works better when paired up with its other products. I noticed my hair was a little bit shinier and smoother than normal. But this effect did not last. The next day, my hair returned back to its normal feel. **Product was sent free of charge by Influenster to review.**
B003BQ6QXK|5|Simple and effective. Has been hanging on my tile for months without any hint of moving. The mirror itself stays clear, and the little shelf is great for keeping my razor out of the way.<br /><br />I would recommend that you don't store your razor blade down like in the photo. At least for me, the conditioning pads of my razor seem to stick to the shelf and leave a nasty mess. I store mine on its side.
B00H8V6J2C|5|Really great soft brush. No shedding after the first wash. Glad I purchased it! My new go to foundation brush.
B0002XG9X2|1|Very disappointed in this product. I purchased this for my 15 and 16 year old daughters. It has not been beneficial at all in clearing up their facial break outs.
B0052P1KRU|5|This cream is so nice on the skin, makes my already soft skin even softer. Great smell, not strong, made with plant stem cells, good price. I like this company's products a lot.
B00H431WM6|3|I've had Eayon hair sew in for a month almost. The hair feels great but it tangles up here & there
B00L4FQVB2|2|It dries out my scalp. Don't care for it.
B00CMLKGVI|3|Forc the price was good buy but 3pieces of tge jewelry the balls went screw on, no 16 gauge needles. Most tge jewelry was not same gauge as needle. Didnt come in bag like said.  Little dissapointed but was still a good deal
B004TBAPWE|1|Disappointed with the scent. Does not smell at all like the lotion.
B006W2SYF8|5|Excelent. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Great.
B00C8KGLN0|5|Great product for removing gel nails with ease.
B00BB683XS|5|I love this hand cream and I think they are discontinuing it because I am having trouble finding it. It works better than any other and you can use it all day with no greasy feeling. My finger tips crack in the winter and this has taken care of the problem. Unlike their hand repair cream- the smell is pleasant to non-existant. Love this!!!!
B00028PFF0|5|This helped to clear my skin nicely. I did notice some drying the first week of use and used a light facial lotion but my skin adjusted by week 2 of use. Smells nice and there is not an overpowering alcohol odor like many astringents have.
B0017K8HJS|5|This product works!! It lays down your hair and tames fly aways without leaving your HARD or GREASY!
B009XHQGY0|5|Long lasting with an amazingly close shave
B001FRNCE8|1|I bought this, and it has amazing reviews. Was surprised at the results. It hardly works at all. I'm used to using a razor to peel off old skin (which is fast!) and then a file. This works waaaaay better than the Pedegg. You could spend all night filing your feet with this. However, in combination with the aforementioned tool, it works well. But so would any file.
B007EF59RS|5|My wife has used Gerlain's products, especially Shalimar for many years.  She is always looking how to obtain it at reduced prices.  She was satisfied with the product that she received and will use the vendor in the future.
B00N4UXI6G|3|This stuff smells and feels like Bengay! I have only been using a week, so I will update if I notice a change.
B00O7ASF9C|4|I have used this eye shadow as an eye liner by mixing with a little water and am very happy that it does not cause irritation and seems to last longer than anything else I have used!  The ingredients are truly natural which is very important to me. So thankful for W3LL People! !!
B00AEINQ9K|4|Love it. Does not get as close as a blade, but good enough. Shockingly good for the cheap price. I use it when I'm too lazy to shave. I keep it in the kitchen candy shave with it drinking my coffee.
B005R3H2HY|1|I feel this was way over priced. You have to put a ton of coats on to look like picture but its not even that cool. Then it doesn't come off. I mean you have to scrub hard for hours to remove the glitter chunks and the colors are not pretty together.
B0015A807Y|4|I love this Shampoo/Conditioner set. It does leave a little residue, but most do.
B004EKVQUA|3|I wasn't too impressed with the razor because it bends the razor and doesn't give a great shave without cutting me.  The brush works great and the arko is great.  I wasn't a big fan of the Derby extra razor blades, but that could be from the razor itself.<br /><br />I ended up buying a merkur long handled razor and it was night and day difference.  It gave me the best shave that I have ever had.
B00K8WF1XQ|5|I am a little too dark for the medium color so I wish I had the one tone darker... BUT it moisturizes my combo (oily&dry). I have the non-matte version of this BB cream and the matte version is very much less shiny!! Really nice for those who don't want to look like they're wearing make-up but need to even out skin tone.
B005DJIEFQ|5|Use lots of this in homemade products. Love the relaxing scent of lavender plus it is so pretty.  Also good mixed into potpourri mixes.
B004D2HJIM|5|Good product, shipped fast
B00IMUCK1C|1|Horrible product!! Such a waste of money! don't use it if you don't want to stay blind or spoil your vision. It has awful chemical smell as well.
B0009OAHIM|5|I love this perfume Dulce & Gabbana. Its smell real nice, very sweet in my skin.<br />I highly recommend this product.
B001ET7C5M|5|Works like a charm. Excellent product and a great deal. We were using another similar product, but we switched to the Sure because it was more effective. Will purchase again!
B008CC4HE8|5|I love this, it leaves my hair really soft and manageable. And i love the price, this is a lower price than local retailers sell it for. I am very happy . Thanks again!
B002BAJ3X2|5|The only natural deodorant that works! I've tried several other natural deodorant brands and this one is the only one that last all day and I workout 5 days a week! Get it NOW!!
B00CLID3WG|5|I am using the shampoo and the conditioner. I use to use pureology Kerastase and I am not going back. Great conditioner.
B001MA0QY2|5|They work so well.like that you can adjust the heat also the nice bag to store them in. Everyone I let try them love them and the price was awesome.
B005K0NAOI|5|Great product. Perfect for someone with a little hyperpigmentation.<br />Read the instructions and apply carefully.<br />Only leave products on for a few minutes each then wash off.<br />This did lighten the skin that darkened die to acne spots
B000TBW0NA|5|replenishing cuticle great, the best that i have every used.  would uses this again and tell every one that has dry cuticle nails to use this product
B0034QW0J6|5|when i bought this i thought that i was going to get a knock off brand but this is the real brand and it is way cheaper. also i got this for my girlfriend and she was stunned at the price
B002MV910U|5|Seriously the pinnacle of customer service. I cannot praise highly enough the quality of product and the perfect balance of professionalism and kindness shown by Tom's Incense. A+++++
B000U26ZZM|4|This is my holy grail wrap lotion for twist outs. It smells good and leaves me with shiny, defined hair.  The bottle itself arrived quickly and in excellent condition. Since I ordered it, however, I have found it at a lower price elsewhere.
B0032EX3H8|5|Easy to use and won't turn you orange.  Adds just a little shimmer to your skin and a great tropical scent.
B00ON38F3O|5|I really don't know too much about lip color. I invested in all of these because I love the lip balm sheer tint that these offer. I'm really pale, so these colors show up really bright, but depending on your skin color these may be really sheer and unnoticeable. I have dry lips so they need to be applied a lot, but thats really the only con.<br /><br />Plus they're shaped like bunnies! I can't handle how cute they are.
B0002OMC5A|5|I love this foot cream.  It's very thick and creamy.  Put some on before bed with some socks and your feet will be smooth in the morning.  I also love the smell although it may be a bit strong for some people.
B00LVSXJXU|5|Cute and inexpensive, I like it.
B001BQXV4O|5|I'M SO GLAD YOU HAD RED BY GIORGIO BEVERLY HILLS. MY HUSBAND JUST LOVES IT.<br />HE ALWAYS SMELL SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD.<br />  HAPPY NEW YEAR.
B000CALZ0C|3|Works well, but melts extremely fast.
B000NJJFBI|5|It's good quality and it curls my hair quite nicely. I used the ones all the way at the bottom and they were great in the drying and even for overnight use. I recommend this pack to anyone. I also like how it comes with all different sizes
B00MMRAE32|5|Used it for a long time, and I really like it for marks,, covers up pretty good!!
B0014JPQ7I|5|Great barrette.
B003UG5ZOC|5|This is great for your purse, car or office.  Nicely packaged, has a blue bag with it.  Smell is terrific, addicting actually!
B00L2P2334|3|It worked great at first but then the bristles starting cracking off
B001G7PLPU|5|just as described Thanks!
B000OZI8HS|5|Excellent lotion. I had virtually no stretch marks after a 10lb baby.
B001RU94C2|3|The almond oil took a while to reach me because the package got lost in the mail, but the company did work with me so that I could be able to get a new  product shipped out  to me. Overall the  product isn't any thing  extraordinary but  I use it in my hair  as a oil and it gets the job done.im am very satisfied with the product
B006PKVYMC|5|It has a lot of space inside, it's lined with soft material, and it's not too tight or too loose. Just perfect :)
B003PLFJBQ|5|I am in late 20's and have worse acne now than I did in my teens.  A friend recommended I try this mask considering my problems with my skin and I was hesitant, but I am glad I did!  It does not solve my acne problem, but it does leave my skin so soft and hydrated and reduces a lot of the redness and inflammation in my skin.  I love using this mask, and use it once or twice a week.  I highly recommend giving it a try for those of you struggling with acne.
B00AM7OE1M|5|Good quality and size.  Great travel bag!!!  Perfect for all size bottles and  cosmetics...very roomy. Love the fact that it is see-thru.
B001115TQW|5|All work for me by having it by my chair where I watch television if I am not ready for a full brushing.  It works when I cannot brush or get to my water pick.
B00AO379SO|1|If you have sensitive skin Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Deodorant will eventually make you break out in rash regardless of the \\"non-irritating\\" claim.  Dove took about three weeks before the rash came on.  Until that point I liked it but the burning rash is a deal killer.  The last few years the only deodorant I have been able to use with out irritation is Adidas.  It can be hard to find but they have really good scents and no burning pits.
B006KVYFBI|5|This little roll on oil is one of those bizarre items that you find that suddenly becomes indispensable.  It's inexpensive but smells like it is, and easily fits in my purse. It doesn't leak in my purse and when I put it on it lasts nicely--even though when I put it on it doesn't smell overwhelming.<br /><br />It has a lovely, warm vanilla smell that I wish I could find in a perfume... but I guess I should wonder why when I can get it so inexpensively in this little oil!  I wear it to the library where I work and have been repeatedly complimented on it.<br /><br />Originally I found this oil because I'd been browsing the perfumes here on Amazon.  An Amazon customer had posted in a review under an expensive vanilla scented perfume that this particular oil smelled better and lasted longer.  When I looked it up it was inexpensive so I figured it couldn't hurt to try it... : )  I don't happen to know for sure how they compare as I never tried the expensive perfume, and I don't plan to as it was quite expensive and this little oil has worked out very well for me!
B000O1L8LA|5|Love this stuff!
B007VCNTW6|5|Bought this for my wife and love seeing it love knowing its on. She says it feels normal when she wears it but says take caution when wearing with dresses and making sudden movements because it has a tendency to shift or want to fall out. I have no complaints about it.
B004FDGYU8|1|I bought this product after getting a keratin treatment and needed a sulfate free shampoo. I have used the blonde paul mitchell line that is also sulfate free and like that much better.<br />I really believe this is just overpriced crap. The shampoo lathers nicely but feel like it dries out my hair, almost stripping it. The conditioner is very thin and didnt seem to condition or smooth my hair at all. Im really disappointed in this product, unfortunately its hard to find any sulfate free products that make my hair manageable.  I will not be buying this again.
B00WV2ZF4Q|5|First off, I would like to say that this is the ONLY eye gel I have ever used that did not give me a horrible allergic reaction.  After the first application, I started to feel my eyes getting itchy, and I was worried, but it was just the product doing its job.  I had very puffy eyes from lack of sleep, and it did get rid of those.  It so far has not budged my dark circles, and that's the only complaint I have, but I have only used it for 3 days, and I will update after a week or so.  I also noticed the product smoothing out the skin around the corners of my eye, so it is accurate on its claim to that. (I am a 29 year old female, if that helps for a reference)<br /><br />The texture of this product is great, it is very smooth and absorbs quickly.  It's is a transparent formula, very silicon like, which I prefer.  You don't have to worry about a white opaque product getting all clumpy.  The awaphui aroma is fantastic as well, smells just like the Awaphui shampoo from Paul Mitchell.  It also worked very well as a makeup primer, I know that isn't the purpose, but it is a great bonus.<br /><br />Over all, I loved this product.  I have been looking for an eye product for awhile, and was starting to get discouraged by horrible allergic reactions (eyes swollen shut reactions).  I would like something to remove my dark circles, but like I said, I'm only 3 days in and I am hopeful!<br /><br />*I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review<br /><br />*update! I added a before and after picture so you all can see the progress!! My dark circles are still there, but MUCH less noticeable!!! Pictures don't lie!
B00C4ETAW4|5|Has cleared my skin and I've only been using it for about a week. I LOVE Shea Terra Organics. Expensive, but actually worth it.
B00CBI31SM|4|I have been using this product for about 2 years now.  I definitely like it better than minoxidil by itself. I feel like it is keeping the hair and hairline that I have.  I would recommend this product if you have a receding hairline and want to try to prevent further loss.
B0020S5F9G|5|Glad to have more of these as my dog chewed up my old one. Thanks for offering a big set of these.
B000SOMZOW|4|I ordered 2 of these sleep masks. (One for my son and one for myself)<br /><br />My son loves his sleep mask and puts it on to feel &#34;cozy and dark&#34; before bed.  He has used it almost every day since getting it.<br /><br />It is the perfect size for a child.  My head is rather small but the mask flattens my lashes against my eyes. I may alter the elastic<br /><br />to get a better fit. It also does let a wee bit of light through.<br /><br />One more little thing -when you first open the package the chemical  smell is very strong- but it does go away after airing out for<br /><br />a few days.
B009ROELAA|5|Amazing stuff!!!
B005VTTG0U|4|Very nice I love the scent but my husband loooves to smell it on me.
B004CCUAHU|3|I bought this because I like Tres Flores products, my barbers used it on me when I was 10 or 11 years old. But this Pomade is a little different than Tres Flores Brilliantine because it will dry our hair. I usually combine it with Alberto VO5 for Gray Hairs or with Brilliantine to get the best result for me. One good thing about this Pomade though, it might last me a long time - I got a 3 pack of it.
B00HCMRUO8|5|I love this shampoo and conditioner!  My scalp has completely calmed down and my hair is soft and shiny. I color and straighten my hair so didn't want to put more chemicals on top of chemicals.  These products are totally natural and you can tell.  I highly recommend them!!
B00TDEF5XQ|4|It's a good product. It's expensive, but it's good.
B003ZS4WQW|5|Ardel lashes are the best
B00FWLXYBO|5|Softest &#34;Chapstick&#34; there is
B0070Y8V0A|5|Works price service all good
B003NSK52O|3|Saw all the good recommendations so I bought this, especially because it contains sunscreen. It feels great on your lips but I couldn't give it five stars because the taste is just awful and it cannot be avoided. Would not buy it again just for that reason.
B00W1J4SFG|5|it works! Just lift and put it on you're lips and sleep on it. It dries like a tape when it's done.
B001E96LCM|5|always good price overthere and love the design of it for body lotion. great texture and nice smell. nothing wrong
B000FS05VG|4|I like it👍
B0037W6PJS|5|Used this for both my singleton and twin pregnancies - love the smell and the non-greasy silky texture.  Rubs in well and didn't come off on clothes.  Used it twice a day with great results.  I know stretch marks are hereditary, but I survived with minimal skin damage I'd like to think it was because my skin was perfectly hydrated.  Smells like the spa...I'm almost out of my last jar and might keep using it postpartum.  Worth the expense.
B004XXQTZ0|2|It would be perfect if it was electrical. The batteries only last one month or less depending on the batteries you use and how often you brush your teeth, and in my household it's a lot so this did not work out for me.
B00V3T10NS|5|I have been using this product for about a month and I am very happy with the results so far.  I notice improvements with the lines on my face and neck. Also, improved texture! Great price and performance!
B001S46QIM|5|Love this product!  Very easy to use.  Will definitely order again.
B0013CYJLU|5|Great product. Light nice smell.
B000VA3LTQ|2|dealer placed adhesive tape over the nozzle-type cap.  The product leaked.  I learned long ago to place tape across the top of bottles and then put the lid on!!
B00F8HWK8K|5|Glittering as shown and sellers told me god bless you and made my day ♡
B00T6WSHBW|5|love this shower cap! Not only is it super cute but it is definitely good quality. i wish it were slightly larger (I have extremely thick hair that takes up a lot of space) but it does the job regardless and i can easily keep my hair away from the shower spray. Love it!
B00000J9DU|2|Very noisy and the unit moves around when turned on.  It's like a cheap toy.  I like the Waterpik better.
B005HGWH26|5|So it tastes horrible. Which is the point. I have been biting my nails for 21 years and now I'm a month in to no nail biting. I seriously reccommend this to anyone trying to quit. But don't lick your fingers lol.
B0033EWRSI|2|Does not do what it claims to do.
B00R2L69EG|5|I've never been into whitening products: trays, strips, lights, goop, grit, gross odors/tastes . . . yuck! I've tried SO many of them.  They were expensive, took too much time to use, caused tooth sensitivity, etc. And after all that I endured, the results often weren't even all that spectacular! It just wasn't worth it, so I just went back to using plain old toothpaste. It's tough to stick with a product that you don't like, after all.<br /><br />That said,  I was recently offered an opportunity to try Crest Pro Health HD through a BzzAgent campaign. I admittedly hesitated because those awful experiences with other whitening products flooded back into my memory. However, I took the plunge and signed up for the  campaign.<br /><br />When my BzzKit arrived with the Crest Pro Health HD kit, I was glad to see that there weren't any crazy contraptions involved. The kit contains two tubes of paste, and after some quick reading, I was thrilled to learn that it'd only take about a minute of brushing with both pastes. That evening, I gave it a go, using a soft manual toothbrush. Step 1 is the cleanser which uses Stannous Fluoride to  deeply clean away plaque. That paste was pleasantly minty, a bit thick, and had smooth consistency. I really felt like it was powering through the plaque, as well as remaining bits and pieces of dinner I had that evening. Step 2 is a slick gel that uses hydrogen peroxide to polish and whiten teeth. As I brushed with it, my toothbrush was gliding around my mouth. It left quite a nice shine, and while it didn't make my teeth spectacularly white on the first try, it did make my teeth look polished. The best part?! Using Crest Pro Health HD was no different than the act of brushing my teeth with any other toothpaste, so I predicted that it would be a whitening product that I could actually stick with!<br /><br />As promised, after a week, my teeth looked considerably whiter and shinier! And as I've kept using Crest Pro Health HD, my teeth have continued to look as good, if not better! Plus, my gums and teeth are looking and feeling much healthier. This kit has truly done wonders for my mouth,  without me having to do anything different in my routine -- it was as simple as switching my toothpaste! Thankfully, I'll never have to use those dreadful other whitening products or paying for expensive professional whitening. I totally can't wait to show the dentist my mouth!<br /><br />#Sponsored #GotItFree #BzzAgentinued to look as good, if not better! Plus, my gums and teeth are looking and feeling much healthier.

B003I34F3O|5|Great color, very warm-toned nude.
B00JVWC5OC|5|This foundation is truly amazing.  I am light skinned, but not fair, with neutral undertones.  There isn't a color in the Bare Minerals powder foundation that works for me (they are all too yellow) so I was hesitant to try the liquid one.  But Bare Linen is a perfect match and is the third lightest shade.  The texture is very light since it contains no water, oil, fragrance, silicone, or wax and is therefore  pure pigment. It also contains vitamin C.  It goes on like a serum, with only a few drops to cover the entire face.  I use this with a goat hair brush I already had but I spread it with my fingers first. I think any natural bristle foundation brush would work.  This gives light to medium coverage and using only a few drops, the bottle will last a very long time. Even with heavier coverage, you can still see the skin through it.  I don't know how this is possible, I've never used anything quite like it. This is not a matte finish foundation but something completely different.  I apply loose powder over it (Urban Decay, Naked powder in light, which adds a little color or ELF HD powder, which adds no color at all) to set it and the finish is amazing.  I have oily skin so the powder is crucial and I use a mattifying primer (Lorac) under the foundation as well.  The fact that this foundation is oil free was a selling point for me. The combination of primer, foundation and powder keeps me shine free throughout the day.  Because of the nature of this foundation, I think it would be equally suitable for someone with normal or even dry skin, provided a good moisturizer was used underneath.  The texture is so light that you would think that it wouldn't cover well, but it does. It even covers a bit of redness I have.  For light coverage you only need 2 small drops, one for each side of the face and for medium coverage another drop or two. I suggest building the coverage using two coats instead of one heavy one.  The price, to me, is reasonable given that it will last quite a while.  I can't say enough good things about this color or the foundation in general.  I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Update:  I've been using this foundation for a couple of months now and I'm totally in love with it.  I recently had some serious redness after using a retinol product that I had an allergic reaction to.  I had red patches in several spots and this foundation covered them flawlessly.  It also did not aggravate the situation and it actually seemed soothing, due in part I presume to the vitamin C it contains.  And although at 50 my skin is still oily, this foundation does not darken, which has been a huge problem for me for many years.  Either that, or foundation simply slides off after a few hours.  I have had no such problems with this foundation.  It's a HG product for me.e a while.  I can't say enough good things about this color or the foundation in general.

B00KS5C1RC|5|Love the headband, thanks!
B004Z245C8|5|This is a great product.  Works wonders on dentures.  Very happy with Polident product.  Would recommend  to everyone.  Thank you
B001E6SWRM|5|Fantastic lotion and one small dab goes a long way
B0012RST58|5|Love this product although it is getting hard to find.
B00SMIIR0W|2|I got this razor as a trial from Bzzagent. It's not for me. It's for ladies who want some hair down there. The trimmer has 4 settings and even the lowest setting didn't do it for me. The razor blade on the other end is just waiting to slice your hand open. The trimmer didn't shave anything even with the setting on its lowest. Great color and great grip.
B0079R6BD2|5|I have used this product for over a year and have experienced good results. It won't grow hair back but it certainly helps you keep the hair you have. Hair shaft thickness significantly improved.
B008WD6PCY|2|I'm not very happy with my purchase. First, the crazy shine product is wafer thin and extremely small - about 1&#34; x 1&#34;. There is hardly enough area to buff a nail. Second, these crystal files are about 1/8&#34; thick and are difficult to get under my nails. I like to round the tips of my nails so I file under and over them.
B001B1F9B2|5|After trying all of the other Nag Champa's, this one is the most balanced. The Red box is nice, but doesn't burn very well, and the Blue box is just getting worse and worse over time. This one has a nice earthy scent with the light classic Nag Champa smell. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Nag Champa.
B001E76B0G|5|I ordered a pack of three of this product, and I don't regret it one bit.  It cleanses and soothes the skin<br />like nothing else I have tried.  No burning at all.  It comes in different scents or none at all, but my<br />favorite is the lavender.  Go out and get some and see for yourself how great this product is.
B00VAY88S6|5|The Item was well packaged, delivered very promptly, and shipped as described. After shopping around for different brand of Moroccan oil and trying several of them in the past, One Naturals has the best bang for the bucks. Using the product for three weeks, I noticed a significant difference, and achieved results comparable with more expensive brands. I was very pleased with the result and will be placing my third order soon.
B00GS8MXQC|4|I love this gel-like Palmade. I was deployed in Afghanistan and wanted products that were good for my hair so when I came back my hair would be nice. I use this to slick down my fly always and curly hair since I have to put it in a bun daily. This does the trick and leaves my hair soft....not brittle like gel does
B00T4T3GCM|5|One of the competitors has a label that says &#34;my beard lifts skirts&#34; well use this balm and oil and your beard will do a lot more than that. Keeps my beard healthy and tamed and couldn't think of using anything else.
B0006NY20U|5|This scent is intoxicatingly fresh!
B000R8ZCUS|5|I've used this product for 6 years and nothing has been as great @ reducing wrinkles.<br />I would recommend this product.
B000C1VU2Y|2|As the other reviewer said it does smell like bug spray (crossed with pickles)in the beginning. It does smell better after a little while, but not an extraordinary smell by any means, nothing distinctive and that would make you want to rush out and buy another bottle. Generic classic perfume.
B007DKV8OW|5|I really loved it. It was a very good purchase. Very easy to use. I Would recommend buying it again.
B00I7PK3GQ|5|I get the most compliments with this perfume
B007WN8ENI|5|I love this product, it really is awesome and it  leaves your hair nice and soft.  I would recommend it to any body
B0050PSC00|5|Heats up quick. Forgot to turn off one day and found it auto shuts off nice. Works like a dream
B000C2104G|5|This is a great product I love the fragrance
B0009OAI7C|5|Quick delivery. Cologne was new in wrapped box. Great product.
B00O9SE1JU|2|Ordered pink, it came in red. Took forever to get here. Did not protect my phone in any way at all.
B002WU6BL8|4|Purchased this item for an event give away in a bundle...and heard good words about it
B004LWFE9U|4|This is a very neutral color, and I am very pale, but it still looks nice.  I love Essie products.  I think they provide a good product in fabulous colors.  So all I can really review is this shade, Topless and Barefoot.  Even though it is pale, it is a richly pigmented polish and only took two coats for great coverage (that's more than I can say for Bikini so Teeny which takes 3!)
B0044UK3CW|3|The product itself is amazing however it didn't come with the &#34;bonus&#34; guards.
B001QY8QXM|5|I recently started wet shaving, and now that I am into it full-swing, I decided to buy a large pack of razors. These are great, well packaged, and provide a nice sharp, smooth shave without being too sharp like other blades.
B00CS7TK7C|5|only brush i can get through my hair!
B00DGWO6EU|5|Great product.
B003AYCGGY|5|Excellent for use as a toner. Slather on with a touch of water and rub in good, cover with shower cap. Fortunately, my blonde hair does not turn purple from leaving this on for over an hour. It just takes any brassy or yellow tones out and leaves my bleached hair a natural blondish-white. Definitely worth a try if you have dyed your hair blonde and it came out yellow. If you leave this on and DO get some purple tones in your hair even after rinsing, don't worry, the purple will fade after a couple washes. I don't recommend this as a shampoo, though. It's a bit drying. If you are looking for a purple shampoo (not a toner) there are better ones out there.
B006L698KA|5|The best stuff ever!!
B00EKVCLY8|5|OMG!!!! This is the best lipstick I ever had, so soft and glamorous. I truly recommend this for everyone who loves lipsticks like moi (:
B002TSA90C|5|The Dove Men+Care Shower Tool has become an essential in my shower. Dove is a reputable manufacturer who is known for producing quality products.  I believe its Shower Tool is a useful accessory that belongs in any home.<br /><br />The Dove Shower Tool has a plastic loofa that is great for working a small amount of shower gel into a lather for an overall clean. This is critical for getting the most from a bottle of shower gel.  This feature alone easily pays for the Shower Tool.<br /><br />I like that the Shower Tool has a scrubber side that is useful for targeting grime, dead skin feet and other challenging tasks. The elastic cord makes it easy to hang the Shower Tool on a fixture and keep it within easy reach.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Dove Men+Care Shower Tool to everyone.
B000KK53L6|5|I'm now 22 years old, and I've been struggling with acne for most of my life. I've tried everything from Proactive, to prescription pills, topical medicine from dermatologists, and most recently, MaxClarity. I wouldn't say that I have extremely severe acne, however I am constantly plagued with cystic acne, whiteheads, or just ugly clusters of pimples. My acne usually forms around my mouth, chin and sometimes  my cheeks and will typically take weeks to heal. When I break out, my self esteem is pretty much non-existent and I hate going out because I think the only thing people see is my acne!!! Most recently I found temporary success using MaxClarity. MaxClarity made my skin soft, and at some points I was completely pimple-free, it was amazing! However, my clear face was short-lived, and I'd have a horrible acne flare-up that would take weeks to heal. In addition, I would always break out regardless during that time of the month. I was able to put up with the roller-coaster success of MaxClarity because sometimes I would have perfect skin that would boost my confidence...however, in the past couple of weeks my acne has been the worst it's EVER BEEN!!! I began to question whether my skin could no longer be helped by MaxClarity. I became desperate for another skin regimen. I've read though probably hundreds of amazon reviews for various acne products trying to find something that might work. That is when I stumbled on Acnefree Severe. I read all of the amazon reviews for this product and decided it was the most feasible to get in a short amount of time to start treating my horrible acne ASAP, plus it had the most positive reviews of any acne product. Now, I'm nearing the end of the first week of using Acnefree Severe. I have to say, so far, it seems awesome!!! Within the first 2 days, I could see that it was starting to dry out my pre-existing acne. Within 4 days, the acne inflamation was almost 90% decreased!!!! My face is looking clearer already. I've been following the instructions dilligently, and just today purchased the spot acne treatment and sulfur mask to see if that will speed up results. Ultimately, I can say that for only 5 days of use, I'm already seeing results!!! I'm hoping that within 2 weeks my skin will be completely clear (seeing as how my progress is now). While I am still forming a few pimples (although less red, not cystic, and not as obvious), I assume that this is just a result of Acnefree purging my face of any soon-to-form acne. My face is feeling soft, my acne is less red and inflamed and easy to cover up with make-up. I've rarely seen a product produce noticeable results in such a short amount of time after using it. Ultimately, I would suggest this product to anybody that can have fairly severe breakouts, but breakouts that have been temporarily manageable in the past. The chemical strength of Acnefree is probably NOT ideal for somebody with the occasional pimple or hormonal flare-up. I'm really hoping that this product works in the long run! I will make sure to write another review in a couple weeks to document the affectiveness of this product. As someone who has been struggling with acne for years and wondering why I'm not the lucky girl that has pimple free skin with no effort, I hope this product works!!!    It has now been about 4 weeks since I started using Acnefree Severe. For the record, my skin looks amazing!!!! My previous breakouts are completely cleared up at this point, and any acne marks are noticeably faded/continuing to fade. For anyone beginning to use this product, GIVE IT TIME. Even if your skin isn't responding to the product as quickly as others, it seems as if AcneFree takes time (although honestly not that much compared to other products) to fully clear skin. One absolute recommendation when using this product is to use a VERY GOOD moisturizer day and night. The strength of the chemicals will likely dry out and irritate most peoples' skin, so a oil-free, strong moisturizer willhelp combat that dryness. In addition, after a couple weeks of use I noticed that the Step 4 retinoid cream wasn't doing much for my skin, in fact it seemed to make my forehead break out a little. I changed the routine so I use Steps 1 & 2 at night, and then apply the acne spot treatment (sold separately) to any acne. This allows me to skip the 10 minute waiting time after application of Step 2, and it seems to be helping my skin along even more. However, this may not work for everybody, so I would recommend experimenting with this step if you find Step 4 isn't useful. As someone who has been struggling with acne for so long, I couldn't be happier with the results AcneFree Severe has given me. At this point, I would STILL recommend AcneFree to anyone similarly struggling with acne and self-esteem. I hope this product works for you too!!    3/6/12  It has now been almost 3 months since I started using this product. Let me just say, that as someone who has struggled with acne for SO LONG and have broken down crying because of the horrible acne on my face, I can say now that my face is the best it has ever looked! I still use steps 1,2&3 in the morning, 1&2 at night with the Acne Spot Treatment. So far, my skin has been almost 100% clear, with only a few pimples arising now and then. I find that using the acne spot treatment at night instead of step 4 clears up any stray pimples extremely quickly (2-3 days). I would still absolutely suggest using a good moisturizer morning and night to combat the dryness of the benzyl peroxide. When I had horrible acne before, I'd have to constantly run to the mirror to cover up my spots with concealer, in addition to wearing lots of foundation. Now, my skin looks amazing with just a thin layer of light foundation and a little bit of concealer to cover up fading acne marks, plus it looks good ALL DAY. I am no longer self conscious and can be more myself without worrying about how people see me. If you are struggling with frequent breakouts that don't seem to be clearing up, I would HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS PRODUCT. It is absolutely amazing, I can't even say enough about it. The key to any acne product is that it works in the long term, and so far it seems to be doing just that. Please please please give this product a try because I have a feeling it will help you just as much as it helped me :)    2/22/2016    Now 4 years after trying Acnefree Severe, my skin has never been so clear and my confidence so high while going out in public without makeup. As with all things skin related, improvements can take time. I never saw a 100% clear-up and sustained results until about a year ago. It is KEY to wash your face using the Acnefree kit every single day, morning and night. I cannot stress that enough. If I skipped a night here and there due to laziness, the occasional pimple would pop up that could take up to a week to go away. Granted, I'm incredibly spoiled now being used to having no pimples and getting one can freak me out. I do notice that even with that occasional pimple, it does clear up in a matter of days (no picking at or messing with it required), and no red spots or marks are left behind. It's pretty amazing.  Like a lot of the other reviews have said, this treatment will leave your skin extremely dry, to the point of discomfort. I use 100% pure intensive healing moisturizing balm (pasting the link below). This balm is seriously amazing because you only have to use a small amount, the small jar will last you months because of that, and the balm consistency is SO MUCH MORE hydrating than a regular lotion. It can leave my face a little shiny, but nothing a little powder won't fix :)     [...]    Seriously guys, I have had so much success with AcneFree that I've felt the need to come back to this review multiple times since I first posted it 4 years ago and let you know how it's gone. Sure, maybe it won't work for everybody/every skin type, but it's worth a shot. Consistent use is absolutely key.Just give it a chance!!! I'm posting a picture too taken today so you can actually see what it's done for my skin.

B00OND90BA|5|Love this shower gel!!!
B000AQF50Y|1|It's fake water down junk
B000052Y6H|5|brylcreem being one of the oldest hair styling companies i've ever heard of, says alot on it's own. But brylcreem is one of the best hair solutions i've ever used. It makes your hair easily managable for easy touch ups. Just a comb through and it's good. Ever seen GREASE, yeah just like that. It's good stuff. Im hooked on it. The only drawback i can think of is it gets a little greasy, but who cares your hair looks great! Gels and pomades don't match up because they aren't redoable, with brylcreem you can change your style in the middle of the day, without having to worry about your hair gel flaking off or dandruff. Im overall pleased and proud to use brylcreem. It keeps my hair back and slick! Brylcreem for the raddest hairdo ever.
B004BD9152|5|Great for refreshing your face when you do not have water to wash it or at the beach to get the salt feeling off you face.
B004GCVQM4|3|This item was hung in the shower and imediately started growing mold. This is a very nice product otherwise. It even had the faintest odor of smoked pork when removed from the packaging.
B004V50JAG|5|I'm a 64-yr old man who washes his hair every day and does not use conditioner because it leaves my hair greasy and un-natural looking when I brush it.  After running out of it, I bought six bottles of this product thru Amazon because I couldn't find it anywhere in the stores.  Before doing so, I tried several comparable products, but to no avail.  This formula has the amazing ability to keep your hair from having that \\"fly away\\" look and keeping it groomed and neat without looking greasy and stuck down.  It works for me!  Unfortunately, it looks like it's on the way to being discontinued.  That's why I bought six of them.
B00FBPE52I|5|If you have plan for a camping or traveling, You must need it. it makes your plan happier. so i like it
B004U1IGXI|5|I wore these to my daughter's wedding and everyone thought they were real!
B001H9HV2S|4|Although I like the product, it's hard to get it out of the bottle!! Whoever designed this needs a reality check, and the person who approved it should be fired.
B00GWBR5N6|1|Doesn't work and useless.  Don't waste your money like I did.
B000JQLNO2|4|Shampoo and Conditioner combination is good. Hair is less frizzy
B005YIN7P8|5|I was constantly burning my hand on my curling iron so I bought this mitt and use it when I wrap the hair around my hand.  It saved this klutz.  I wish they made something to tape on my forehead when I straighten my bangs.
B003Y04OK0|5|I love this product, and I use it every day. I only use a half pump, and this is enough to cover both under-eye areas. I had trouble with puffiness and dark circles in the morning, and this product has taken away the sleepy look (even though I wasn't sleepy). I would recommend this product to anyone!
B00TG1HIOA|2|Very long! Returned it
B00008J1YB|5|Especially with a small baby - this thermometer is the best way to keep track of temperatures. The filters need to be replaced and this is a very easy way to get the filters. thanks!
B0007DHH88|1|This is the worst toothbrush ever. It is very, very, very loud and the brushing is hard, course and irritating. I used it for a week and then gave up.
B0012RXAGG|5|I love the this scent. It is so sweet and I always get complimented on how amazing it smells. I wish it were a little stronger but all in all one of my favorite scents!
B007OQQHQ4|5|Perfect! Can't find this in stores anymore.
B0006A3S4Y|4|I can get a great look with no bother in an instant of  application with the powder sponge. My old standby.
B004X8K0UK|5|Smells great. Good product. Happy customer.
B001KYUF5K|5|Works well with oily acne prone skin.
B00C20F6OG|5|I love it.  It gives clean and clear skin effect.  Great product! Great seller.
B008U1Q4DI|5|so nice my girls love making new things up for their nails very nice would tell my friends about it if asked
B008RS4LO8|2|Shipping took too long! I ordered 2 of these because the price for 1200 pcs was unbeatable but the spaces are not filled like shown in pictures and I have not sat and counted all these TINY little gems but I can definitely say there's not 1200.
B001D3LY8A|4|The Acai Berry may be the next great discovery.  The eye cream is a pleasant feeling product that has made my undereye wrinkles look better.
B00CD24NQ0|5|I've been using floss picks for a few years now as I find them much easier to use than regular floss. Over the years, however, I haven't found a specific brand and model (?) that didn't break easily during use. Often, it would take at least two floss picks to get the job done. Well, the Complete Clean floss picks from Dentek appear to live up to the advertisement of shed-proof. I've almost cleared one entire bag, and I've had no breaks. Pretty amazing based on my experience.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who wants a break-proof floss pick.
B00NN7JGPM|5|Just as they said easy
B000M4FXA6|5|Works great and it saves money over the pre-assembled filter. Just look at how the old one comes out and put the new one in the same way.
B00L4XL82Q|5|Not what I thought but I like them all the same
B000SOOIAQ|5|My shower stall has a textured floor, so I suctioned it to the side wall. That worked great! And it makes it easy to keep it clean because the water drains off and it dries between showers. It feels nice, kind of like a scrubby terry cloth. The bristles are not super stiff like a brush.
B0080L9FHA|2|This toothpaste is like brushing with water, it does not foam up at all like others would and it does not leave my teeth feeling clean. I'll use what I have but I will not be buying it again. I've used better organic toothpastes.
B000I1RA7C|5|I LOVE this!  I can't get enough! It makes your skin super smooth and has a nice light scent.  So far I've used this in conjunction with my coffee sugar scrub and my body shop cellulite massager.  SO far... using all 3 of these things I have noticed a huge difference and it's only been a week!  I can't wait to see the difference in a month!  I am really happy with the results thus far but don't know how much the fat girl slim really helps since I use it along with everything else.
B00HYK9RB2|4|This product is great!
B007K6A4I0|5|This new Gucci Flora is great, the soft scent lingers through the day. Is great for day or evening. I love it!
B0074TZJT2|1|worst hair clippers I've ever used. they stopped working the first week i had it. I oiled it every use.
B000H3EO3E|5|It is exactly what  I wanted
B000MX3GHY|5|Ordered these for my wife b/c she loves them, but they're becoming hard to find in retail stores. I believe they came in a pack of 12, so she'll be good to go for a little while.
B001FWXHF2|3|I really liked some of her other perfumes but, this one has a sickening vanilla undertone.  So if you not a fan of vanilla, pass on this one.
B00EOWDAYI|5|Love this lotion!
B005GIS2Z6|3|It is well designed for your hand. But it does not shave as close as I would have hoped.<br />I am a woman and use it on my legs.<br />Never use it on your underarms - it bites!
B000LNB8HK|5|Does what it's supposed to do. I spray my clippers while they're in the on position for a few seconds after every shave (~1-2 times weekly).  Works well.
B001ADQTHO|5|This powder was discontinued, so I absolutely had to get it off here. I can't believe I spent so much on this stuff though...about triple retail price. I guess that just says how wonderful it is. It's great for oily skin.
B002V8UXSS|5|❤️
B00AIDZOPA|4|Just a little willful your hair without feeling sticky.
B00J8VUH5U|4|We use this product for cleaning around the house, little homemade concoction, works great leaves the place smelling great!
B000P27DUS|5|My boyfriend loves it! I got it to go with his new car and he's happy. It will look great on his shelf and smells great on him! He says it smells like another brand he used to use called Chrome. I don't know much about that but I love it :) a lot of spray for the money. Bottle about the size of your palm full to the brim.
B003S516XO|5|It has very nice features: digital indicator for temp, auto shut off after an hour, twisting base to prevent the cord from tangling, and it's pretty thin so it's (kind of) travel size. Plus the colors pretty too.
B000VKZMHK|5|I've used just about every shaver on the market.  Remington's burn my face, Norelco's don't provide a close enough shave, and Braun's don't last and are too expensive.  This shaver provides a close shave that is oddly enough incredibly similar to a blade.  It's fun to use and even on the neck doesn't cause any irritation.  The only draw back is that the power cord is not spiral so it takes up a lot of space.
B00HU10YGW|5|it looks like something you could get from forever 21!<br /><br />the ring looks just as it's pictured here.<br />it took exactly 2 weeks to come!<br />the delivery estimate said july 10th, but it's june 27th and it's already here so yay!<br /><br />it can even fit on my thumb but it looks best on the middle finger.<br />now my hands will look cute asf whenever i flip people off.
B00JT6036C|5|I have used all kinds of face creams on my face and neck I am so glad I found KESHIMA,  I really like!
B003TNITJO|5|Love this scent. My SO got this for me as a christmas gift as I'm a fan of Aqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani. The scents are similar but I believe this one takes the gold. Great for a day at the office or a night out. 5/5 Would recommend!
B004W1XHPS|5|I wandered over to the mens fragrance counter at an upscale department store while my wife was shopping for an outfit.  The lady showed me this product and gave me a sniff.  I really liked it but told her I needed my wife's ok.  Later we both returned and could find no one there to help us, but the sampler bottle was still on the counter.  After my wife got a whiff she wanted to buy it on the spot.  We looked around for a salesperson but it was near closing time and we couldn't find one.  I decided to check Amazon after getting home and was really glad I did because in the store this same bottle was $80.  It's a whole lot less here and is exactly the same.  It came in a sealed box in record time.  Made in Italy - how can you go wrong?  Could not be more pleased.
B00MRH014E|5|Seems to be very good product. Usually trying to grow a beard, my cheeks itch too much. This product is keeping that under control. Love that it is all natural
B006E809K8|5|Feels wonderful going on, smells wonderful, and leaves your skin very smooth. No need for lotion afterward! Great for shaving the legs, ladies, too!
B002X9XV48|1|I purchased Luminary from this buyer the bottle looks completely legit and all the great reviews made me buy it. I tried it and it was a COMPLETE disapointment, i did not get dark at all. I truly believe this is a FAKE. I had a base tan with Masquarade and its cheaper and gave 100% better result. I dont recommend spending your $40.00 here. NO NO NO!!!!!
B002VA4FUS|4|no different than their regular pomade.
B00HKLFZI4|5|PERFECT PRODUCT
B000SKZT0S|3|Not as good I was expecting, but good quality for personnel use. It is not a professional tools. I recommended
B004GEV5XM|5|This is a really great product that I hope to never be without.  My 2 daughters and I have bery long, very curly ethnic hair and this product is the best for detangling hair and making it soft without being too greasy.<br /><br />If I can only have one product to use in my hair, this would be it because you can cleanse, condition, and detangle with it.<br /><br />I love it so much that I buy it in the liter size.
B00F3L5T2U|5|Awesomeee! Omg i really love this bag. It can take a lot of things (makeuo brushes pads drugs etc.) the color is soo nice. I get a lot of compliments about this product !!! Would absolutely recommend
B00IUHTU24|5|Awesome product. Makes hair soft, straight,  and relaxed. This is a must have product!
B00LBCQXPW|5|after two weeks, this is my favorite toothbrush I've ever used. I won't know if it's actually the best until I see my dentist in a few months :)
B00B8UMZJ0|1|Product does not work at all. My daughter has fine hair and 3b-3c curls. However this product made her curls shrink more than usual. Would never buy this again. Horrible. Waste of money
B00838FLXW|5|It's not the most comfortable tool rolling across my skin, but it does what it's supposed to....My skin is looking a lot better!!!! Make sure to do your research before your purchase as far as how to maintain your skin after use....Love it, my skin looks great after several months of use.... Usage Tip: Warm up a damp towel as warm as you can stand it..(don't burn your face) Place the towel over your face until it becomes cool and then warm and apply a second time. This helped me to open my pores and loosen my skin as the needles didn't feel as bad penetrating my skin. MOISTURIZE, MOISTURE, MOISTURIZE!!! Coco butter, shea butter works great for my skin!!! I also use Apple cider vinegar w/ mother as a natural astringent to clean my skin....
B00JJAIMLQ|5|These are beautiful!!
B003BQ6QXK|5|You can't go wrong with this... Great product, clear, large view, squeegee, razor holder!  Completely fogless.  FYI - Don't waste your money on the suggested 3M adhesive strips.  This product comes with a tube of silicone that holds the frame of the mirror to the wall &#34;semi&#34; permanently.  Which means, if you ever (why would you?) want to remove it, you would just pull it down and peel the silicone off the tile.  It looks sleek, not tacky, as if it belongs in the shower.  If you forget and leave the water in it after showering, just dump it on the person you shower with the next time you shower, that's what i do! It's freaking cold and I only got slapped once... every time it keeps getting funnier (to me anyway).
B00PVJN4XA|2|Not real mink
B008FNGTM2|5|This is a great alternative to conventional toothpaste. It is SLS free, but foams just enough.  It cleans well, has a pleasant taste- the cinnamon is not too spicy- and has a good thickness/ texture so it does not slide off the toothbrush. I will buy this again.
B0002KHU3I|3|I chose this because it was the best deal available for replacement heads at the time.<br /><br />It definitely works well and does the job.  The reason I went with 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is based on personal preference and not product quality. I prefer the single head version that came with the brush over the dual clean model.  I find it less comfortable when  brushing.  It certainly is not so bad that I won't use them or felt a need to return them, but next time I need new heads I'll go with the regular head.
B000A3V1QO|1|doesn't work
B000CNME22|1|Davidoff no longer makes Zino cologne. CVS Pharmacy was sued for selling counterfeit Cool Water because it's still being manufactured.  This is skunk water compared to the original stuff.
B00BZ1QP6G|2|This really made my face break out. Also there is a lot of shimmer/glitter added which I think is pretty unnecessary. However, my friend used this and it did not make her face break out so I gave it to her. I suppose it might be a good product if you don't have sensitive skin.
B000NMH512|5|my Mistress and i love it!!!!<br />It's sooooo much fun, a great product.
B008532OZ8|5|Awesome. It lasts all day without smudges.
B0026P3HF2|5|Love! Great color. People ask what blush I use and are surprised that it's cover girl!
B001BHUFTW|5|This nail file is the perfect size for my purse. The file is not too rough and does a great job. The case is just plastic, but does the job. I would definitely buy another one.
B000N33SS0|1|Products were  expired
B007QG7G3U|3|This isn't the greatest shaving cream but its okay. I was hoping it would work like Coochie from Pure Romance line but its not as good. If you have sensitive skin or get razor burn easily, I'd suggest avoiding this product.
B0037MJ9LO|5|Please don't discontinue.... I love this product.  I can't find anything comparable.  Heard rumors this is getting pulled.  Boo :(
B002E6TSZ6|5|Hem brand makes so many different types of good quality incense. One stick usually lingers in my room. For more than a few days after being burned. 😀 they did good job about sending my order out after it was shipped
B00BMJJNQA|4|It was very hard to work with but looked great at the finish<br />It was painted with colored chiseled markers then sprayed with alcohol for a great finish
B001DKMY9Q|5|I was looking for an electric shaver and came across this one, the shaver is very comfortable and it shaves excellent. The arc holds a battery charge of about 2 weeks and this is very nice. the feature that i like most about this shaver is the fact that when your done it's incredibly easy to clean. It comes in a nice traveling case also. I would recommend this shaver to anyone
B003UKM9CO|5|Teeth feel clean (this is my first electric toothbrush).<br />Good for fitting smaller mouths.<br />Charging is easy.<br />It gets messy but it's easy to clean.<br />Recommend.
B00AFITAB2|5|Best product for my hair yet!
B00CRQPNX4|5|Very good oil, just used the last of it. Need to get more soon
B00V8RR70K|5|There is not enough good things I can say about this lipstick, it is definitely my holy grail.
B000F4USF8|4|I owned one of these for a while until it broke, then I got the same one again. I like the versatility and that it is so easy to clean and rinse under water. The only caveat is that the hair can clog the trimmer, and to clean it the adjustable guard needs to be removed. When you put the guard back on to continue, it is easy to dial in a wrong (too short) setting by accident. But eventually I learned to look out for that.<br /><br />Now here is the reason why I am writing this review: The rechargeable battery on my trimmer was getting progressively worse, so I decided to try and replace it. It is possible to carefully open the trimmer with the right screwdrivers. Inside, you will discover a single NiCd AA cell. I tested it with my trusty LaCrosse charger, and was told it had around 580mAh capacity left, which was barely enough to last through a single use of the trimmer. Also, the battery would usually self-discharge in a day or two, and combined with the very slow charger, it meant that I needed to charge the trimmer a day or so in advance to actually use it.<br /><br />I removed the NiCd AA cell and soldered a single NiMH AA Eneloop in its place instead. This new cell has around 1850mAh and virtually no self-discharge. This means the shaver will now run 3x as long as before, and when I leave it in the drawer for a week or a month, it will not have lost its charge. The motor turns faster too. I took some care to make sure that the case was properly water-proofed again during assembly, and all is well now.<br /><br />Why can't Panasonic put a good battery into their trimmers to begin with?
604113452X|3|This was a little tight for me so they hurt my eyes but I did cut the straps and made my own so they're great!
B00IKJ20TC|5|This is a really good product and has helped improve the health of my hair. Will purchase more...
B008Q025UE|5|Soft, soft, SOFT hair!!!  I have coarse, curly hair.  This puddin' makes my hair soft, manageable, and defrizzes!
B00AZKXASE|4|I love the colors, For me they didn't stay on the full 14 days but about a week which is pretty good too, I wear it under my gel polishes...
B001886K48|5|Great!
B008DLT9H8|3|Its a great brush but broke upon taking it out of its packaging. I just glued the broken part back on.
B00AFEMBFS|3|it cleans like if a put clear glue on my face and then i wash it with water all that glue will come off like in little balls on my hads... is sooooo weird.<br />i defenetly will not spend 60  bucks on this again.<br />reserch about this onlie first.
B00005B70C|4|I've used this razor for about 2 yrs.  For me and my wife, it gives me a great close shave.  I've never had a problem with skin irritation.  Just how hard are these other guys pressing the razor on their face?!  I can't imagine.  I only need the lightest pressure to get a good shave.  The shave is fast, about 2 mins.  The dual blade design (each of the three heads has two rows of blades!) is awesome, makes the shave clean and fast.  I'll probably stick with Remington rotories from now on, but will upgrade to a corded/cordless.    My problems with it are:    Can't use with cord if the battery dies (didn't know this when I bought it)  The gears in the head strip/slip easily if a long beard/mustache hair gets in, which requires turning it off and back on again.    Otherwise, it's a great solid razor.
B000R8ZCUS|3|For what I paid, I expected phenomenon results. I did see a difference when using this so I will not repurchase. And some times I get a small burning sensation on my cheeks (I do have pores there). I'm not sure if its do to the fact that I use black soap to wash my face.
B0050QJHTO|5|Great
B004WPWOS0|4|This product provides great protection and coverage with the slight tinting in the lotion. Once the lotion is dry it feels light, not tacky or greasy.
B003L6CS1O|1|I am completely upset with this product. I Thought it was going to be the solution to my body odor, but it FAILED. This product promises odor free for 3 days but one day i used it and I smelled BO in the same night. I am sincerely very upset. NOT BUYING AGAIN.
B005UOAJLQ|5|I saw increased shine to my hair after just one use. It is a very thick rich cream that seems to really stick to the hair and not run off and drip all over
B00B2DYP50|5|Love the way this lotion glides on and leaves behind pleasantly scented silky skin. Will order again and pass along to family and friends.
B00G9K31NI|5|Love this stuff. Foam is handy and the pink champagne scent is prob my favorite so far.
B001OBVQAW|4|Shipped and received promptly. A little shorter than I hoped it would be and magnification not as much as I would have liked. Overall, good.
B00FULYKG4|5|Best one I have ever used!
B00KB4EQOG|4|Very nice product but not enough for very long thick hair.  It worked as promised with no residue nor buildup.  Worked well with humidity and my hair retained curls and style and was very soft and sily.
B000GG1944|4|This is better then other conditioners ive used. Leaves my hair feeling great, not dull. I look forward to trying other nexxus products
B004VTFL00|5|Great product for a great price on Amazon.
B000BVAYFO|5|This is soap and like most soaps it foams up when you get it wet.<br />Oh yeah, it also smells nice and works well for shaving.<br />Its Soap,<br />It Smells Good,<br />and its....<br />well It's<br />Soap<br /><br />Semper Fi<br /><br />John Snyder<br />GySgt. USMC Retired
B00BH0JJ54|3|Very pretty.
B006U1QN90|5|not the best but nit the worst
B005IMHCS8|4|I love these! THe only problem is that the elastic stretches out
B004FO6U2Y|5|Very good sunscreen; is not greasy and doesn't bother our skin.
B00OI4ANG0|5|This spray is a good product to buy to prevent your hair from thinning. In addition, if you are currently losing hair, I recommend this product because it has helped me out a whole lot. I am now starting to see a regrowth of hair at a fast rate.
B005Q7EM2O|5|As my skin ages, it has become very sensitive and shaving was giving me serious razor burn. I tried Nair hair removal and it still gave me some burn. This one with Aloe does the job and it's gently on my skin. This will be the one I'll be buying from now on.
B00C2BHZD0|5|Bought for granddaughters, one with straight hair one with very curly hair..both love ghem
B000FS05VG|5|This blow dryer is light and quiet. The attachments help you get the desired look. I recommend this product.
B00JBLMY1C|1|It made me sick to me stomach so I stopped taking it.
B005D5LIRG|5|I tried the rose geranium scent and was a little nervous about not being able to smell it first before purchasing, but it is very light and subtle and actually leaves no fragrance on my skin anyway so really it is just a faint fragrance while you're showering.  The soap is mild and on par with the other all-natural gentle soaps I usually use.  I am happy to have found this company as they seem to really be committed to using truly pure & natural ingredients.  I have been happy with several of their other products, as well!
B002DPUY4W|5|I was looking for a deep scrub and i got that. it foams nice and smells good and left my face feeling like new. It tingles and woke me up and started my day.  I am really glad i got two. I have had it for a while and havent started on my 2nd yet.  Lasts a long time.  Love it, and def recommend for acne for adults and teens, no oil!
B002XHBW4Q|1|I do not like this product.  May work great for others but it's really messy going on and the color is not what I expected.
B00AEDY3H4|5|I love the color and the shine. In natural sunlight I have never seen anything so beautiful. This is what I would most definitely call a silver polish in low light condition however.
B0085YK77O|5|At first I did not get it even though it said it was delivered. I let them know and they were kind enough to ship me another one. This one I did get and love the color and the bling toe separator to go with it which was a nice surprise. Good customer service. Thank you.
B0031Y9KF8|5|This shampoo is great!  I purchased my first bottle from the salon and was unable to find more until I searched Amazon.  I was told to be careful however in purchasing some hair products from here because if it doesn't come from a salon then you don't have a guarantee on the product and that it is what it says it is.  This arrived however, the top of the bottle had broken and there was shampoo everywhere! I called amazon returns and they worked with me on the issue.<br />Warning however, this shampoo does have a very strong perfume smell to it.  The smell is amazing, but it's really strong and fine for that 1 T of shampoo but if you have allergies or smells set you off, this could do it.  I love the smell of  my hair after using this.  When I received the open box of shampoo, I had to toss it ASAP because it was starting to give me a headache.
B0047QILQS|5|A fantastic EXTRA soft toothbrush. Neede because have 'toothbrush abrasion' & stores don't carry decent EXTRA soft. Have purchased these before from other vendor (entire family uses & loves). Been buying/using this exact toothbrush for longer than a year.  Tried this new vendor because lower cost per brush. Reason likely because package does not include a 'travel case' per brush. No matter to me. I want the toothbrush. Happy for spending a bit less on them. Ordered 2 sets (total 12 toothbrushes).  Will order again & again!
B000PB06QW|5|This spray is light, adds body without that sticky heavy feeling and now they stopped making it!  Bummer.  I use it before the round brush regime and a little after and it really does the trick as I have fine hair.  Honestly, it's really the best I've found and have been using it for years.
B00BPMQK38|5|Magical Product!! If u don't like it, u prob did it wrong:( Takes me about an hr to do procedure to my frizzy friend n then she has celebrity hair for about 3-4months :)
B004K119DW|5|It says to use it a few times a week, but I use it once a day, every day. It really helps with acne issues, but mainly, it helps with the overall evenness of the texture of my skin. I have combination skin and from using this it helps to balance the two zones to meet closer in the middle. It takes care of any and all flaky issues. Using it on daily basis does not irritate my skin in the least and in this tub version, it lasts FOREVER! You need very little, and would say that this size lasts me 9-10 months.
B001PT7SK0|1|Sucks and it stinks!!! Don't buy it!! had high hopes but they were dashed by the smell and the lack of performance.<br />Leaves a residue on your hair.
B001FB5I7S|5|Love this stuff. My local health food store closed that carried it so I tried a few other brands that didn't work as well. I was pleased to get so many (6) at a great price.
B00OP27C1O|4|I received a sample for free to test and review from Influenster.com. While I usually love scents with fig, I was not entirely happy with this scent. However, I do really like the oil elixir itself. I do feel like it softens the ends of my hair. I have color treated hair, bright red, so my ends are a bit damaged so this did work pretty well when I straightened my hair (Smooths out my fried ends). While I usually only use shampoo/conditioner for color treated hair, it's about time for a color refresh so I was able to try this. It didn't strip much of my color like I was worried about, which was a plus. Again not a huge fan of the scent, but have smelled worse. My hair was very soft when it dried, so that was also a plus. Overall, I was pleased. Look forward to trying the other scents soon.
B0088Y7VOI|5|Very good product so far, still trailing the product, however it has lasted longer than the opposition - Elite Serum , which only lasts me a week and claims to last 4 weeks !<br /><br />So far the product has lasted me nearly 2 weeks.<br /><br />jay
B004VBJED8|1|I bought this because I liked that it contains all natural ingredients. I also wanted some help with my gums, which had a small amount of receding happening over many years. I've been using this toothpaste for a month and I've realized that my gums have receded at a faster pace than ever. It seems to be harming my gum health, not helping. I haven't changed anything in my dental regimen except this toothpaste. :( I also get a film on my teeth by midday and have worse breath than when I use other products. I wanted to love it, but I don't recommend this toothpaste.
B000CNOANI|4|I first bought this for my wife years ago and now she doesn't like to wear anything else.  Well, she likes to wear clothes sometimes, but she doesn't like to wear any other perfume.
B001A3HPT0|5|As a relatively new straight razor shaver, I may not have a lot to compare this set to, but let me tell you my thoughts.  I have uber sensitive skin and I was a little hesitant when my wife picked this *very* inexpensive set up for me.  It works fantastic!  Looks to be decent construction.  The brush works well and is not at all scratchy or anything.  The soap has a very clean smell - not stinky or flowery fragrant and lathers great.  The lather easily lasts throughout the shave.  What I can really tell you is that when I run out of soap or if I break something in the set.  I am getting more of this.  'Nuff said.
B00AEJ8PC2|2|u left left clearance price tag on @ $6.99 -NEXT TIME I HAVE TO KEEP MY EYES OPEN FOR .HOLIDAY SETS at walgreens or jewel if I want a good deal,,,u might want to take tags off
B0009OMU0A|5|Works perfectly. Love that it is cordless.
B00WOVHV4Q|5|This is really good. I highly recommend it.
B00OR1IL68|3|doesnt feel as good as my keys eye butter does.
B0002Z8ODI|5|These brushes were used by a lady that cut my hair a long time ago. They were so old and I was so happy to find them on amazon!
B009ZRFJGY|4|Good
B001CL9XHM|4|Works well, but it smells like black licorice (which I really don't like).
B0033EWRSI|1|I bought a tube of this stuff.  When I pumped it the first time, it expelled air and flattened out with only the very top of the tube full of cream.  I took it back to Dillard's Dept.store for an exchange.  I pumped the second tube at the store.  It flattened out.  The tubes are full of air making it look like you are getting a full tube at their already exhorbitant price.  Then, it turns out only the very top of the tube is full of cream.  Isn't there a law against that?
B001F38ZVC|5|This is a great product to give volume and moisture to very thin hair.  I love it and was happy to see that I could order through Amazon since my locals stores discontinued it.  I have used this product for years.
B00I6GQVTE|5|Works great!
B00GYHCKNI|5|Fast shipping. Great. Thanks!!
B004NJG65M|5|great product
B002VECJ9I|5|Been using this for twenty years.  A peachy pink color.
B0058E3XJI|5|i get super dark super fast with this product. i didnt like it at first but after using it for a long time its my go to lotion. contains alot of bronzers so wash your hands!
B00150LT40|5|Best fast drying top coat in the market.
B00CQ4K1DO|1|only moisterizes if it is completely melted.Very gritty if it is not. Gets all over<br />your rug and carpet. but it is all natural,<br />what can I say.
B0019ZEVZU|5|teeth feel as clean as when leaving a dentist office.  this brush replaced an older model and that one was the second soniccare I have purchased.  Now on my third brush in 12 or so years.
B0014C4162|1|A big 0 it says a pack OF TWO!!!!! I only got one sow I got ripped off padding for two and only one  comes.
B008YQ9AD0|3|Price is too high for what it includes. They shoul add more items in this Kit to be worth it.
B00DDJM3GY|5|(I am the wife of this Amazon account's owner... FYI)  I have been using this product for over a week now and I could not be more impressed.  It takes off all of my makeup and leaves my skin feeling fresh and moist.  I have very dry skin so that is a huge benefit for me!  I think my skin looks better than it has a in a very long time.  I also love that it takes (literally) an extremely tiny amount to make a great lather.  It's going to last forever!  I couldn't be happier with this product or this seller.
B00ASDC7G4|5|Love Peter Coppola Finishing Spray.  This new Argan oil spray is quite nice and smells good too.  He seems to be easier to find these days on Amazon.  Thank you very much.
B00517W47O|3|When I try to take it out of the holder the cleaning cycle starts which wets the head that over comes me with fumes
B007762NQE|5|I bought several bands of natural deodorants all in one batch after being highly disappointed in Nature's Gate Winter Clean. I tried LaVanila's grapefruit scented stick first and it only lasted about 4 hours, but was the most expensive of the bunch. The following week, I tried Welleda's sage scented spray and was highly impressed with it. It lasted all day. In Texas. In the summer. In July. EO's was my third try and was blown away by the results. I cannot smell anything even in the morning. I only sprayed it three times under each pit in the morning. Impressive. And it's the cheapest of the bunch. I'll keep using LaVanila's till I use it up; maybe over the weekend on a leisurely day or something. It smells really good. It's my favorite smell; shame it doesn't last. I will continue to use Weleda's and EO's sprays alternating between the two since I like them both. But, which one am I repurchasing? EO's spray. For the price and lasting protection, it's a bargain.For reference, I am a very sedentary person at work. I don't sweat at all once I get to work, but I'm usually in a hurry in the morning and by the time I get to my car, I am huffing and puffing and may get pretty hot. I work out every morning and apply deodorant after my morning shower. I have never used natural deodorants before this year. And if you're like me, you will be very surprised that most of these guys sting and it takes a few days (or even weeks) to get used to that. The only one that never stung was Nature's Gate, which is now out of my rotation.<br /><br />Lastly, Amazon has this at a much better price than my Whole Foods. Keep in mind, this review is what worked for me. I know all of us have different chemistry and your experience may be different, but I hope my review helps you spend less money trying out natural deodorants.
B007HD570Q|4|I've very sensitive skin but this toner doesn't give me allergies. I've only used for a couple weeks, and so far haven't notice any difference yet as far as skin condition goes. I will continue to use it though, because it smells good and refreshing after applying it to the skin.
B000P9CPH2|5|It will stain, just like all the hair dye products. Use a little dishsoap on the corner of a washcloth to get it off your ears and neck. It is a fantastic color, that as it fades, fades purple, as opposed to the Deep Purple color that Ive used for over 2 years that tends to fade to a pink-y that I'm not so crazy about. It's not a shocking blue, it's nice and calm and rich.. I LOVE IT.
B006ONHGCM|2|I have minor rosacea - redness, some bumps - not incredibly bad but I'm still embarrassed by it. It didn't seem to help me much, it's such a small amount, it's expensive and I was reading lots of reviews so I want to share with others what I found works for me (and is way cheaper). I use Eucerin Night Redness Relief and love it, you can find it at the drugstore reasonably priced so that you don't feel bad about really slathering it on at night, I use prosacea on any bumps at night - it's just a sulfur acne formula so I'm sure you could use another brand just on any breakouts because it can be drying, in the morning I use Burts Bees sensitive skin moisturizer. This combo has been great for me, very few outbreaks and much less redness (other than when I drink). This condition is difficult and awkward but I feel like I finally have a combo that works without being forced to spend $50 on 1 oz of cream so I wanted to share even though I think everyone has different results.
B002NGMENA|5|THE BEST. My other bonnet dryer from another company was dreadful. The hose kept falling out of the bonnet. This one is amazing. It dries thoroughly without burning the ends of my hair (tucked under the rollers). When using the &#34;high&#34; setting you do not feel the heat at all. Again - THE BEST.
B00BPUAUB8|1|Bought for essential oils, but they stop working after a little while....very disappointed
B00KARQ8U4|5|Convenient on-the-go comfort without strong fragrance.
B000C1ZFBG|5|exquisito
B007IAE5WY|3|It's too large for a washcloth, and has no absorbent qualities to use as a towel.  I'm trying to cut the cloth to size, and that will hopefully work better.
B00QQIMZJO|4|This is a nice light weight moisturizer and a little goes a long way.  Initially your face feels a little dry after you put it on, but soon after it feels very silky.
B004BVPLCG|5|This is an excellent product. I am using it for bed sore healing/prevention. It goes on easily and remains most of the day. For more problematic areas I cover the Calazime with Anti Monkey Butt powder. It makes a powerful barrier.
B00A8M0ARI|2|I have very sensitive skin so I knew this would be along shot anyways, but this is not that great. Its more of a bronzer lotion that you would use while applying makeup than an actual tanning lotion because the lotion itself is tinted so you look tanner but its like one of those gross fake tans you get and if you rub your face or neck even a little bit it comes off in flakes. Yeah, it's as disgusting as it sounds. It also doesn't smell too great and clogged my pores super bad. So, I had two options keep this on and have a tan but possibly flakey face if I wasn't careful and break out like crazy or wash my face to clean my pores, hence removing all color from my face. It literally is just a tinted lotion it did not help me gain color in the tanning bed whatsoever. I use the jwoww one and done on my body and I have just been using that on my face as well and I don't break out as long as I wash my face that night and it doesn't wash away my color like this does.
B003ZSDR9U|4|Drift to the islands.  Very creamy too.  But like many lotions, the fragrance doesn't remain as long as I like.
B000EOR49W|5|I love to play games on my PS3 and PS4 but hand pain limits me. I apply this cream before and after playing, and they simply don't hurt afterwards. Remarkable stuff. Way better than other ointments that smell, which I have tried.<br /><br />One tip, DO NOT touch your eyes until you have washed your fingertips and back of your knuckles of your index finger as this can really irritate your eyes.
B006UMU4NK|3|It does what is supposed to do
B00AML1CKY|5|This comb is a must-have for anyone wanting to tame their unruly moustache. Hercule Poirot would have become one of his own adversaries for one!<br /><br />I had my doubts, as I've never bought a \\"premium\\" comb, but the Kent 81T works great!<br /><br />I was using (reluctantly) a green, plastic piece of injection molded crap that came with a tube of cheap moustache wax. The teeth, if you want to call them that, were thin, mostly bent, too close together and pulled the hairs of my impressive soup strainer so much that I rarely used it. The handle is also so small, it WAS difficult to hold. (I've uploaded a photo showing both combs, if you would like to compare the two.)<br /><br />That has all changed with the Kent 81T!<br /><br />I ordered three from a seller in Jolly Old England, of all places, and I keep one at my desk at home, one on my desk at work, and one in the watch pocket of my jeans (which is perfect for this diminutive comb).<br /><br />The comb is a little small, but not TOO small. After all, you're combing a moustache, not a sheepdog.<br /><br />The handle is adequately large, I am able to easily grip it even with my large manly fingers (those of you of the feminine persuasion may find it a delightful fit), and using it to comb my 'stache is like a dream: There is NO hair pulling with this hand-made, sawcut comb!<br /><br />I also bought three tins of Burts Bees Miracle Salve and I am using the two together on a daily basis to train my rather anarchistic lip-follicle-extrusions.<br /><br />You can also use the comb on your beard, in a pinch, but this comb really does its best work on a moostache.<br /><br />I've never owned a \\"premium\\" comb before, but am so impressed with my Kent 81T, that I just ordered a Kent Rake Comb to use on my head hair.<br /><br />These combs are a little more expensive, but I think they're worth it!<br /><br />Pamper yourself today!
B000X2BS8I|5|I have used Once Upon A Potty successfully with two generations of boys and girls. The system provides a multi-sensory approach to make toilet training more fun for toddlers and easier on parents and grandparents.oh, and what toddler doesn't like a \\"potty song\\"!
B0056GDG90|5|Its good.i liked
B00LVPDBA4|5|Very good, very practical, I very love
B004XJO0QE|5|Great
B00HVNS1AU|2|The product is not fair it is yellow.  Does not work with my fair cool skin tone.
B00KCAV3W2|4|The best part of these is that it has the acetone soaked pad, foil and sticks together to hold on.  my only reason for giving this 4 stars is that the instructions are not really there so we lost several in the process of understanding how to properly flip the wrapper to have it stick to itself.  Recommend for anyone who loves to put on gels
B003Z4SGJA|4|I've been using this product for approximately 2-3 weeks now. While I cannot say I noticed a difference in sun-spots, I do find that my skin is very soft after applying, AND, breakout free. The texture is great--not greasy and it is super absorbent. Soaks RIGHT IN, and QUICK. I also purchased this for my mother who has considerable sun/dark sports. I will post a revised review if she ends up noticing a color difference. I use this at night as a moisturizer. The smell is very pleasant and relaxing--not overbearing.
B00D5TB1LK|5|I really like this makeup set. It was a lot larger than I expected. Every time I've worn it, I've gotten compliments on my makeup. :)
B001ENZ6II|5|Great production. Smells wonderful!
B000S97MAY|5|Works great! My eye was irritated for the second time. Last time it lasted about 4 days. The skin was ridiculously red and swollen. It happened again and I just happened to find this product and applied it. The irritation lasted half as long as it lasted last time. My eyes were only red for ONE DAY, and the next day they were swollen so I would say about 2 days to calm the skin. It is great and feels amazing on the skin, you automatically feel your skin really soft and flexible.
B005CFMLKU|4|This powder gives just the right amount of shimmer without being too shiny.  The only downfall I have with it is that if I put it on too heavy it looks kind of white on my tan skin.  I love that the compact comes a sponge and mirror so you can carry it in your purse and use it any time.  I'm sure it would look the best on paler skin tones because it is pretty light.
B004XXKIGQ|4|Great product and sticks well. But you can get similar at a lower price.
B000C217X0|2|Very light scent, Paco Rabanne not seem authentic and it took a long time to be delivered. The way to apply the lotion is uncomfortable because the system does not bring the spray system.
B001MA0QY2|2|I was really looking forward to using this straightener but it didn't work out for me. I got it today in the mail and gave it a try. The box and packing is all authentic I believe. I had an anti-frizz cream in my hair and when I used this iron it totally scraped the product out of my hair and caked on to the iron. The main problem was that it kept snagging on my hair and the plates did not feel as if they were gliding on my hair. Also, the plates do not touch so I don't know if this is the problem or if the hair iron is just like that. But my hair snagged a lot and the product I had in my hair came off on the iron. When trying to clean the iron, it took me a while to scrap off the burnt product. I also tried putting waves in my hair but that didn't really work either. I was trying not to take the temperature too high as I have thin hair. The hair iron awkwardly just flipped my hair out. It wouldn't even give me a nice inward curve, it would do this weird looking flip. I am not an amateur at using a hair iron, I was looking for a new iron to replace the Chi one I have. Unfortunately, this hair iron just did not work for me. :(
B004QLWYX0|5|Absolutely love this polish.  It does a great job exfoliating and leaves my skin soft!
B00JZ4UCVO|5|My mom's favorite lipstick and color -- hard to find -- she is thrilled!
B0014ZMW3S|5|I could not find this in the stores anymore, and I love it!! I think they discontinued it!! I am really bummed if they do not carry it anymore!!
B00M6MO7MW|5|Great color
B002WTC37U|5|I love this product . I have lots of complements a bout my hair. I apply only from the middle of my hair to the tips. It keep my hair so soft the frizz is gone!!! I also use flawless from the same brand. I absolutely recommend it. Amazon have and excellent price.
B00198ZPU2|5|Great tool for manicures!
B003UTEE32|5|Love this product! If you want some oomph in your hair that will stay all day this is it folks. This is my 4th bottle over many years.<br />Go for it as you won't be disappointed :)
B000JLAVAO|5|Beautiful scent that is not overwhelming.  I have asthma, so I am very sensitive to smells, but this one does not bother me at all.  Light, floral scent.  Very feminine.
B0057XSDA4|5|Love the rich color of this polish. Only a thin coat of this China Glaze polish is needed over your favorite base color. I have paired  it with coral and black and they both looked fabulous. Crackles evenly without looking clumpy. A clear coat is needed afterwards to make it look shiny instead of matte. Overall an awesome polish.
B001KYQ4VO|4|I like it - but it's rather messy to apply.
B00GQU5YY0|5|Having fun with this eye liner. Goes on great. Thank you
B007K6K0IY|4|I was given this product for free via BzzAgent. Honestly, I was little scared trying Secret Outlast® Clear Gel. I decide to try it for the first time a few weeks ago. I had two outdoor weddings to do that day. Pretty risky move but I am glad I did. The gel dried up pretty quick and didnt leave any white maks on my black shirt. By the end of the day I still smelled great under my armpits and thats a huge plus for me!  A few days before I ran out of my sample Secret Outlast® Clear Gel, for some reason, by the end of the day I had to re-apply because I was not smeling so great. Not sure why but it didnt stop me from using it again until I completely finished it.  Honestly, it works very well and I was not dissapointed but I am not sure if I would purchase this product again because I have been using the same deodorant for so many years but I am still open to try new ones that come my way.
B00N996X4G|5|After only 3 days of using this product, I have noticed a difference in the fines lines smoothing out. I have also used it around the lines on my upper lip and smile lines and it does make a difference. I would highly recommed this to anyone.
B00016XJ4M|5|Wonderful smell, my skin feels great!
B008KC8YIA|5|Love this product. Tricky to get the hang of but once mastered unparalleled by other waxes out there. Washes of easily.
B00CGAO9NG|5|I have used this for a number of years and it still works wonders!  It makes my skin soft and helps to give my skin a more even tone.  I use it all over my body where there is lots of discoloration.
B00557MWPE|5|Awesome even better than I expected
B000P9EMTG|5|Nothing like this stuff for use after a day in the sun.
B0006NYV3S|4|Would give 5 starts if it came in a smaller size option.  I wanted to keep in my purse and it's just a big jar to carry all the time. But the product is amazing.
B0033CWUCI|5|I love this product! It has a subtle scent and does its job! I find that it works best when it can sit on the nails for a little while instead of trying to remove the nail polish immediately upon application (as you can do with some of the stronger chemical polish removers). Enjoy!
B000FHDBSG|5|About 3 yrs ago I had dandruff pretty bad ,it would be all over my shirt. I happen to see it the shelf in Walmart. It was cheap so I figured I'd try it. Within 3 weeks the dandruff was gone and I have not had a problem since even my barber was surprised.  Great stuff.i
B00U6LD3Z2|5|I hate to admit it, but my hair has thinned out quite a bit over the last few years. Especially on the top of my head. I have tried a few hair fiber products to help camouflage the problem. Some are okay, some are a major disappointment.  Most aren't cheap, so when they aren't what you are hoping for, it's upsetting. I don't have money to throw away. I was presented with the opportunity to purchase this hair loss concealer at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I gladly accepted. I am sure glad I did because it's by far the best I have tried so far! It matches my hair perfectly and went on easily. A little goes a long way. Although, I advise applying it carefully so you don't get it anywhere else (Like your face or clothes, I learned that the first few times I used concealers). It looks natural and covers any thinning I have. I definitely recommend this Hair Loss Concealer by Hair Magic Products! I hope this review is helpful!<br />(Sorry about the poor volume of my voice in the video. I managed to convey all my thoughts in the video in my words above, though)
B005BCAV9M|5|exelente
B00II2F1QA|5|Love the product. Wish there was more for the amount you pay for.
B00BR0H6KY|3|Not the best strips.  They are kind of cheap.  They don't stick on that well.  I guess you get what you pay for.
B00KWD6NCO|4|Look good easy to expand and material looks like a very high-quality.
B008BZDFJE|5|Wonderful stuff my hair feels amazing thank you.
B00SKQFT4I|5|Great hairdryer!
B0049LUI9O|4|I think it is enough for you using is very easy and also cleaning. it is worth for this prize
B000CALZ0C|3|I received the trays today, and they didn't come with any instructions.  Also, the three trays were together in a little plastic bag, don't know if they are kept sanitary.<br /><br />The trays themselves are the thicker than I thought they would be. I read some reviews where people said the trays melted into mush when they boiled them, but I had the opposite result. I boiled the water and dipped the tray in, then followed the forming instructions but the tray didn't really change shape. I dipped and re-dipped about 7 times and they still aren't really any different, so they aren't really \\"custom\\". They are good enough for now I guess, but I have a feeling I will have to re-whiten do to the fact that the tray isn't formed enough to my teeth.
B00F6BZK3A|5|great
B00A4U4TIK|1|The worst thing I've ever bought they were not good extensions at all I wore them once and the hair fell out all over the place
B003VKVEHY|1|NOT MY COLOR, THIS IS REDISH ORANGE
B0009V1YRS|5|I bought my first Chi Turbo after the straightener I had broke. I was hesitant to spend so much money (far more than I'd ever spent on hair supplies) on a product I'd never seen, but with a recommendation from my friend, I went ahead and took the risk. When I got it, it was much smaller than I expected (my fault for not paying attention to the description). My previous straightener had huge plates, and these were only 1\\". I was not confident - I thought straightening my crazy hair would take an hour with this tiny thing, until I tried it. The first time I tried it, and my insane, tangled, frizzy, jumbled mass of hair became straight and sleek and lovely in 10 minutes, I was hooked.<br /><br />That was 5 years ago. In the past 5 years, I've moved several times, throwing this thing in boxes unprotected and throwing stuff on top of it, have mistakenly left it on for more than a day at a time, left it lying out on my bathroom counter constantly plugged in, always kept it on the highest heat settings, and have thrown it in my bathroom cupboard haphazardly, never taking particular care to protect it. It's taken a beating from me, and it worked perfectly for 5 years. In the past week it's refused to heat up past barely warm, the light won't flicker, and resetting it doesn't work. I think my Chi has finally kicked the bucket, but with all the abuse I put it through, I'm amazed and impressed it's lasted this long and worked so well the whole time. I'm absolutely buying another one, and can't wait to have a Chi back in my bathroom!
B00EHKTNLG|4|I like the sharp end.  The open ends do not really work for me.
B004DBVQ14|5|It really is creamy and dreamy! This particular version is my favorite. I find it moisturizes extremely well and does not leave your skin smelling overly fragrant. It also lasts a very long time.
B00861RXNW|2|They are okay
B00GTC1FFW|5|The &#34;peace&#34; brand makes perfect sense in this case. This face wash has no scrubbing particles that some of the other ones have. While I enjoy many of those types of face washes, I can say that it wasn't really missed here.<br /><br />This face wash is great for two reasons. It smells great which helps you make sure to use it in the shower. I also found that I don't need to use a lot of it to feel nice and clean. The five ounces will certainly last you a long time.<br /><br />This is probably my favorite of the Axe face washes that I've tried over the years. I've been favoring gentler face washed lately and this is a top notch product.
B002IN0WZU|5|Speedy seller - got right away. Great magnetic clasp. Makes putting on/taking off necklaces a breeze.
B0093OHLM4|5|I would like to say thank you to Fast Shipping Supplements on their timely<br />> and just as promised description of this product. I think this product is<br />> the best of all I have tried over the past year. After doing additional<br />> research on Raspberry Ketone's the importance of having high grade clinical<br />> strength is the key to the success of taking this product. You do not<br />> receive an abundance of energy but the appetite suppressing and fat loss<br />> are a definite deal by using this product. I have dropped 2 pounds in just<br />> one week simply by taking as prescribed, walking and not feeling hungry all<br />> the time. I have cut out snacks, because I have not had any cravings in<br />> between meals and feel a bit more energetic,more by just my change in diet.<br />> I recommend any one looking for a better product to give this one a try, I<br />> did and so far I have no regrets of my purchase. Happy fat loss!
B002VECJSY|5|This is the best bronzer ever! It matched perfect with my complexion and had very light gold shimmers. I recommend this product to any and all ladies of color. It's very sad that Queen Latifah is not getting the best out of her product since it is not sold in most drug stores. I was so happy to have found it on here. I'm in love with this product!
B000VKZMHK|3|I bought my last Panasonic razor 15 years ago, and it worked well for all that time. But I decided it was time to replace it and bought what I thought would be the latest upgrade. I did not actually want the HydraClean feature--I think that's mostly a gimmick to get you to continuously buy the associated replacement parts, and in any case I was able to clean my last razor simply by using the little brush that came with it. I just wanted a new, and potentially better, version of what I already had. This unfortunately isn't it. The shave is almost as good but not quite. It also has an annoying indicator light that flashes frantically when it is fully charged, as though I should be excited about that information and take some action. Note to manufacturers: It's great to have an indicator light to tell you something is charging, or that it is fully charged, or that there is some kind of problem that requires an action. But, particularly with regard to charging, there is absolutely no reason to have it flash, and since people typically leave their razor in the bathroom, where they may need to go in the middle of the night, a flashing light is actually an annoyance as it tends to wake one up. Overall, this is still a perfectly adequate razor and I will be using it for the next fifteen years in all likelihood. I will probably just break the indicator light. Although they don't tell you this anywhere, you can just ignore the HydraClean thing, as I plan to. I will say that the shaver fits very nicely into one's hand, and being a Panasonic, will probably be fairly trouble-free.
B0009VO8JO|3|I think I'm allergic to whatever fragrance is in this moisturizer.  However, it does work really well.  I won't be able to buy it again.
B002LMLN9W|2|Supposed to hold for 12 hours. Had to replace glue every two to three hours. Did not make it through a meal without teeth coming loose.
B00245XPEM|5|This was my first BB Cream. I read other reviews and took a chance. I have only good things to say. No streaking, no heavy paste look, just smooth skin, no heavy creases around eyes.I notice when I use a make-up remover in the evenings before bed, very little color and stain is there. My skin absorbs the cream. I got lucky with this product. I hope it works for others. Remember our skin is different, none the same, results for me, may not work for you. I will be reordering. Now the market is flooded with these products. I chose something not from the drug store. It works.
B004GINGOY|5|I ordered this sea salt to make a salt rub for some christmas gifts and it is just the right size granules so that is is not too abrasive on the skin but does what you want it to when mixed in the proper proportions with a carrier oil.
B0009MHJE4|5|I've been using this shea butter for my family's skin care needs with great success. I make it into a homemade body butter or just straight out of the container. The shea butter alone has a nice nutty earthy smell that can be blended well with essential oils. I use it instead if petroleum based products for my 2 year old's eczema. It holds in the moisture well and adsorbs into her skin pretty quickly. It works well with cloth diapers as a light diaper rash cream. I'll use a bit at the first signs of redness. It also fades scars after a few months and reduces the appearances of stretch marks. I think it works better on stretch marks than cocoa butter or bio oil. It does take a while but they fade faster with pure shea butter. My husband uses it for his hands instead of lotion and it works well for him. Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase.
B001BAH8XU|5|Pinon Incense Box with 40 Bricks burning and that wonderful smell remind of the time I jumped  ship in Hong Kong and I make my way over to Tibet, and I get on as a looper at a course over in the Himalayas. A looper, you know, a caddy, a looper, a jock. So, I tell them I'm a pro jock, and who do you think they give me? The Dalai Lama, himself. Twelfth son of the Lama. The flowing robes, the grace, bald... striking. So, I'm on the first tee with him. I give him the driver. He hauls off and whacks one - big hitter, the Lama - long, into a ten-thousand foot crevasse, right at the base of this glacier. Do you know what the Lama says? Gunga galunga... gunga, gunga-lagunga. So we finish the eighteenth and he's gonna stiff me. And I say, &#34;Hey, Lama, hey, how about a little something, you know, for the effort, you know.&#34; And he says, &#34;Oh, uh, there won't be any money, but when you die, on your deathbed, you will receive total consciousness.&#34; So I got that goin' for me, which is nice, and these wonderful little insense bricks.
B00CJ01QT8|1|I am very dissapointed. I thought that it would make my face smooth and hydrated. It didn't work for me. As soon as i applied it to my skin, it opened my pores and left my face dry. It It made my wrinckles appear worst.
B008B9Y0EY|4|Nice scent. I'm hopeful it will help during cold season this year.
B000XJ92E8|3|This brush is about the size of a half dollar. Maybe it gives the size on the site, but I was expecting it to be bigger. Works well, but is hard to hold. Wish it was bigger.
B005LQ2RWW|5|This tool really works. It does take time to get used to using, but once that is accomplished the hair is gone.
B008A0QXZI|5|When I went to the beauty salon, they used Shu Eumera products on my hair, and my hair was so soft afterward.<br />I called my beautician and asked her what the product was. She didn't want to tell me, saying it is prohibitively expensive, and only sold to specific entities, and not available on-line........, but I finally got it out of her.  I was able to find Shu Eumera products on-line, but she was correct; they are ridiculously expensive.  Sooooo, I did some research, learned that the active ingredient is Camelia Oil, and with further research found that Shiseido makes haircare products with Camelia oil, as well. Camelia = Tsubaki.<br />I have rather fine, extremely curly hair, and a lot of it; my hair tends to be quite dry, in the winter.  I have tried no less than 20 different products for dry/damaged hair, and this is the absolute best.  My hair is soooo soft. I just love it! I use the shampoo, the conditioner, and the treatment. All wonderful!
B006UJ7QZC|5|Made my hair so soft!
B00KCFAZTE|5|I have never tried anything like this before.  It seems to be diminishing the fine lines around my eyes and also some acne scarring on my cheeks.  I would recommend it.
B002C741MM|5|This trimmer I love because of its simplicity, ease of cleaning, and versatility (operates by battery AND direct plug-in).    The previous posts that downrate the product because of the battery probably don't know how to use Nickle-Metal-Hydride batteries.    The trimmer is clearly labelled on the back with a battery icon in which the letters \\"NiMH\\" are written. This trimmer runs on a Nickle-Metal-Hydride battery, which experiences depletion or voltage depression, or what's commonly called a recharge \\"memory\\".    So all you have to do to keep this trimmer in top shape is FULLY discharge the battery BEFORE recharging it. For years I've successfully used various sorts of NiMH-powered devices by maintaining care.    All batteries eventually wear out, or gradually deplete voltage levels, even Lithium batteries (which do not have memory, and are increasingly used in cell phones, electric cars, and sonic toothbrushes). Hopefully we'll be seeing new beard trimmer models with Lithium batteries soon.
B0012XXDG2|5|Provides a clean, smooth shave.  The scent is good - like a barbershop.
B003E1IXGA|1|I had high hopes for this stuff when I got it at the barber shop because of how much I have liked other Paul Mitchell products. However, this is not a good product. It's simply Murray's Pomade with a different odor and color. It's really greasy, doesn't look dry at all, doesn't wash out easily, and doesn't even hold the style all day. I would actually say Murray's is a little better than this stuff,  but costs like 1/4 the price.
B00H2A1OMY|4|Since my son don't have fine motor movement of his right hand, he's able to open this with his left. Although I would love to see slightly bigger compartments.
B000QYEK88|5|This razor is great!  Makes shaving a breeze and feels like a proffessiona piece of equipment.<br /><br />Thanks!
B000NN3G8W|3|This did nothing at all for my redness. I do have severe redness with my Rosacea and have found very few products that help it. So this may not be an ineffective product, it just did not work for me.
B000FS05VG|5|Really good, dries my hair fast and easy!!<br />Doesn't  damage  my hair at all.
B00AFCOWB6|5|I love this product. It makes shaving so easy. Not to mention it smells great. I would highly recommend this product. Especially with summer here it's a must.
B000XE5260|5|My husband loves it.
B001CS8BJ6|1|Not worth it
B004W24LQ6|5|The face wash I was using regularly worked pretty well but was SO expensive I just can't continue paying that much. I used another product recommended by a friend along with a natural face mask one night that she said helped with acne. A few days later, my face looked worse than it ever had. I have very sensitive skin with stress breakouts on my chin and some blackheads that appear on the pores of my cheeks. My face became very dry and had a slight rash. I didn't really know what to do so I decided to get a very gentle product and use as little on my face as possible for a while. So far, the combination of this face cleanser, a clean pillow case each night, and using all natural/organic shampoo and very little makeup has made my face better than it has ever been. I think people with breakouts tend to fuss over their face more, which does more harm than good. This cleanser feels wonderful when I put it on, and my face feels nice and moisturized after I wash it. I use very little face lotion in the morning and am considering using more BB products now that this cleanser has worked so well. I may try the toner and night-time face lotion next. I have not had one breakout since this product and that in itself is a true miracle. It has also helped a lot with the redness I get on my forehead and chin. I use coconut oil to remove eye-makeup, and this cleanser removes my face powder and blush very well off my face. A few people mentioned they fear this will get discontinued...I really hope it does not! Five stars!
B00GBZCK7O|5|Loves these...looks great on my baby girl!
B003NGQ0F2|4|This goes on smoothly, stays put and doesn't bother my eyes. I wish it had more natural ingredients. Other than that, it's great.
B00FEZ9RQO|1|Very hard bristles, this hurt my face. Nothing like the real brush replacements. I would give 0 stars if I could. I actually used 1 to clean my shower, it was that stiff!
B000ALDJ7A|5|I HAD TO BUY A SECOND ONE FOR OUR HOME IN THE SUMMER. THERE IS NO PRODUCT ON THE MARKET THAT WORKS AS WELL!
B0017BI7NS|4|My daughter loved this. It arrived on time. The only problem we had was one of the bottles leaked and made everything sticky. We cleaned everything and everything is great.
B00MS41GJ0|5|Easy to use, doesn't pinch & really curls
B002VH64KA|2|I bought this item hoping it would cover without using heavy make up during the summer. It does not. It goes on super light, which is great. Waste of money!
B00FU574H2|5|This is a great hairdryer.  I bought it after using the same model at a gym.  It puts out a lot of air, is reasonably quiet for the amount of air it puts out (which is the main reason I bought it), and even the controls are nice as the switches operate in a smoother fashion than many other models.
B00TGQR8X6|4|Years have gone by since I've owned an electric shaver and I was reminded with this one why it's been years.<br /><br />I've read other reviewers mentioning that their type of facial hair doesn't match up well with ANY type of electric shaver, I too have this problem with my neck hair, hence not owning an electric this whole time. This shaver does an awesome job everywhere but unfortunately once I get below my jawline that's where things change. This thing really mows thru my facial hair and does a pretty good job without any razor burn which is a problem I also have even with a blade. The tricky part is my neck hair, I'm assuming it grows in strange directions and not a continuous direction/pattern like my face. I've found that if I go in a diagonal pattern in four or five different directions and about 10-12 swipes it will get 90% of the shave completed, leaving me with a few razor swipes. Definitely not perfect but it sure beats making a mess with a razor and shaving cream.<br /><br />Since this is my first electric razor I can't speak for others but I'm definitely not disappointed! The battery life is amazing! I've had this thing for about six weeks now, shaving almost every day but missing a few here and there and I've only needed to charge it once! That's a huge upside to me!<br /><br />Now, the flip up trimmer built in to the back... While it works pretty well and flips up and closes pretty easily and while the shaver is still on! The location of it is kind of a pain in the behind. It's located behind the head of the shaver and unless you get just the right angle trying to trim, you can't see what you are doing! I'm actually surprised they made this feature without anybody testing it and making the same observation? I mean it's better than not having it of course but it seems like something the company added as an afterthought. You won't be doing any beard sculpting with this trimmer that's for sure but it works well for a stray long hair here and there.<br /><br />Overall I'm very satisfied with this shaver and would recommend it to anyone! If you have razor burn problems like I do, you won't regret it. Multiple passes on my tricky neck hair still doesn't give me those ugly red blotches I'm used to with a razor!
B005M4YQEU|5|Awesome toothbrush & shipper sent lightning fast.  A++
B00J9QXSZ0|3|It was not as good as I thought it would be. It did add volume a little but not really any length. I was expecting different more dramatic results but it was just a bit above regular mascara.
B00EUZE0I4|4|By mixing some of this with Maybelline's Cream Mousse foundation, I am managing to avoid too much of a flat, embalmed look. It may have glitter in it, but I don't see it; it does provide a bit of a glow to old, dry skin. Until, that is, I find a foundation that already has some illuminizing ingredient in it.
B001Q88HK0|4|Was a tad dark on my complexion. I had to mix it with a lighter foundation and got it to work that way. Difficult picking a good foundation. Also by itself the product feels like but does have good coverage.
B004Z209HS|5|I've been using it in my beard and loving it. My wife has started using it on her face and is hooked. The dispenser is helpful too, I wonder if they have an economy size!
B000P2750G|5|I was introduced to Knowing 20 or 30 years ago when abroad, and it continues to me one of my and a friend's favorite scent.  It's great that it's still available online, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a fragrance that is enduring, pleasing, not too floral or spicy, and very feminine.
B00GTBZI74|5|There is no way you can beat this shampoo + conditioner for the price.  It works great and is cheaper than anything else out there.  This is a no-brainer for men.
B00CM8SM3U|4|I use to be consistent user of Moroccan oil until I discovered this product.  It smells wonderful, lasts all day, and very small amount does the trick.  I have naturally curly, color damaged hair. This product smooth's frizzy and straightens my mane when applied to wet hair.  I use to apply two pumps of Moroccan oil in my hair, but Living Proof only requires a half of one pump otherwise my hair can get thin and a bit greasy looking.  When applying wet keep this product away from your roots.  My hair looks great for two days!<br /><br />Only draw back is that I have to apply a heat protectant when using this serum as a straightener.
B000VVT94G|5|It balds nicely. Hubby loves it.
B004K3D0FK|3|Its Ok product. Argan oil works much better for any hair type though.
B005D87J5S|4|My favorite sad they discontinued this scent
B00008K4UA|5|Still using with no problems after years of use.
B0002DTV0K|3|I bought this soap because I constantly fuss about how my face looks (...who doesn't ?) ..and because I read about the great benefits of using Emu oil as a facial skin rejuvenator .<br />I would recommend this soap as I mentioned in the headline ,but not something to depend on for the long haul ?
B002P9O45Q|5|Great product!
B001514JPU|1|I think that some people must be laughing at us who have tried this product.  It's like they had this idea to make some \\"natural\\" wax strips.  They probably realized they didn't work somewhere in the testing process, but decided to market them anyway.  They probably figured they could sell a whole bunch before people started to catch on.    The strips do not remove hair.  AT ALL.  Not even a little bit.  I used an entire package and did not successfully remove one hair from my body.  All I did was cover myself in a sticky mess.
B0012TLPR0|4|For the price this lotion is a lot better than I expected. I have used it tanning 1-2 times per week for the past 6 weeks. I have a nice golden tan...not the fake bronze color. I would have given 5 stars because I really do think this lotion is a great deal compared to what you are spending in the salon, but I'm not a huge fan of the sent. It kind of has a hint of vanilla musk and personally I am not a fan BUT I would purchase again. Too good of a deal not too!! :)
B00IYE1YHM|4|This was a Christmas gift; my daughter was thrilled to receive it. I know she likes it as she has used it previously and asked for it as one of her presents.
B0018C0MJS|5|Very professional grade clipper. The combs are perfect for whatever depth you like.  I have an original Wahl from the 1960's but it's pretty dull now...still works though.  Consider the numerous other positive reviews, this one will likely last the rest of my life !  What appliance product can you find these days lasts that long ?  PS. like one other review noted:  Put the clipper, combs and OIL in a shoebox for safe storage.
B005D0S7LQ|1|Item arrived beat up and eyeshadow crumbling, it appeared to be an old product pulled out of a junk drawer. Very disappointed in this as I can't even use it! For what I paid for it...that was money down the drain.
B0081E6YX4|3|Neutrogena is one of my favorite drug store brands, and I use their cleansers religiously, so I had high hopes for this product.  Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations.  It's a lovely moisturizer, I'll give it that.  However, it had no effect at all on my skin tone.  I'm going back to my regular moisturizer.  :(
B000MN63CO|5|I didn't know that the shaver needed replacement shaver foils. After replacing it, this worked so much better! I was thrilled and the price was right too!
B009LUS2GY|5|love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next tim
B000OOQOCA|3|Liked item, need to select different shade next order.
B00MGVKA4C|1|TERRIBLE
B00AEINQ9K|5|Easy to use, clear shave<br />Cleaning takes the most time
B005JUTA0M|3|The color change does not look the sane as the picture
B001BKFF76|3|I have allergic contact dermatitis, so I have to wear gloves all the time. The fingers on these were too long, so I can't do much while I'm wearing them. The glove fits my hands and wrists well, so I just wear them to bed with ointment.
B000X2W616|5|This mirror met ALL of my expectations.  It was easily installed, and importantly the mirror is excellent quality.  I highly recommend this mirror for purchase.
B0037IESXC|5|This Volupt Volume Building Spray-Gel by Sebastian is SOOOO AMAZING!<br /><br />I have fine, thin hair.  It is naturally dirty blonde but I color it a lighter blonde with lots of highlights and lowlights.  I have never had any success with volume building spray.  I tried John Frieda volumizing root spray and it made no difference.  I don't generally use product on my hair because it just weighs it down and makes it look greasy or stiff.<br /><br />I thought there was no hope...until I tried this product.<br /><br />I have steam rollers that I use for curls and volume in my hair.  Caruso - and they have been a MIRACLE for my hair.  Seriously, look them up.  Anyways, I don't need any hair spray or product when I use these rollers.  I tried the spray-gel by Sebastian before I used the rollers, and the curl was visibly larger and the extra volume was noticeably there!  I was amazed!  Normally, by the end of the night the curl is basically gone and it's all flat by the next morning again.  But when I used the spray gel, it was still voluminous the next day!!!  I woke up with sexy hair!  This was just astounding to me.<br /><br />I have also tried it when just wearing my hair straight.  I put it in and blow dried my hair for about 5 minutes (I was in a hurry) so it was still really damp when I left for work.  Let me tell you - I still had so much volume!  And it STILL lasted into the next day!  This product really works.<br /><br />If you are looking for more volume or think that your hair is limp and hopeless, GO TRY THIS PRODUCT!  It is worth every penny!  It also smells nice and light and feels light on the hair.  Absolutely no greasiness or stiffness.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00DP3ADXI|5|I'm in my mid-30s and still get monthly (hormonal) breakouts.  They're nothing like they were 20 years ago, but they bother me, nonetheless.  I'd been using some products from the drugstore and they worked, but they were overly drying.<br /><br />Note: the Amazon product page currently lists the ingredients of this product.  However, the second ingredient is missing (see the two commas next to each other after water?).  It is azelaic acid.  This is actually a pretty important ingredient for a product like this.  When I was in college, my dermatologist had me on a prescription azelaic acid cream.  (Azelaic acid is derived from wheat, barley, and/or rye, so this product may contain gluten.)  This also contains salicylic acid, which will be familiar from many anti-acne products that can be purchased from drugstores.  At any rate, this product has a couple of known, effective breakout-fighting ingredients.  (It also has willow bark extract, which is going to add more salicylic acid.)<br /><br />When I received this cream, I saw that it was advertised as containing moisturizers.  I decided to test out the moisturizing capability by discontinuing use of my normal moisturizer.  This was a risk during the wintertime (I have combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry cheeks) because I am outside a lot walking my dog.  However, I am pleased to report that my skin has not been dry at all since I started using this about a month ago.<br /><br />This product is not perfect with respect to its breakout-fighting powers, although it is pretty good.  I did still break out a little bit, although the breakouts were probably not as extensive as they would have been without the Stay Clear Cream.  Also, I think the severity was decreased and my skin healed more quickly.  You may have even better results if you also use the cleanser from the same manufacturer, as I think they are designed to work together (I did not test that out, though).  Additionally, as discussed above, this product was non-drying.  If you have problems with benzoyl peroxide and similar treatments, this will be gentler on your skin and may well be worth a try.<br /><br />I love that this doesn't contain any artificial fragrances or dyes.  There are some plant pigments (lycopene, astaxanthin) and extracts, although the cream is white in color.  I've been using it twice a day for a month and have had no sensitivity-type reactions.  The product comes in a metered pump that gives you just enough to cover your face (no waste, which is important since this stuff costs a bit more than similar products).<br /><br />Here's how I work this into my skincare routine.  First I use a cleanser, then a toner, then (in the evening) a serum, and finally this cream.  I remember from my college days that my dermatologist stressed allowing my face to dry completely before applying the azelaic acid treatment I was using at the time.  I decided to heed that advice with this product, as well, and so far it's been working for me.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for people with sensitive skin and mild-to-moderate breakouts, especially those who can't handle some of the stronger anti-acne products marketed for teenagers.  Since it's moisturizing in addition to fighting breakouts, it's like getting two products in one.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a free full-sized container of Evologie Stay Clear Cream from Truth in Aging for evaluation purposes.was non-drying.

B0045IZ9Z4|5|I am a long time user of these tong scrappers, i stoped for a while and my tong felt very rough and dirty.
B0006O4ORA|5|As a non-Japanese, having used this stuff for maybe forty years, I can say it works well. It's fine black powder, so no whitening to it. But it's neutral to the stomach, smells neutral, tastes like salt only, and it works well for teeth and gums, for me better than toothpaste I've tried. It doesn't stain, cleans from sink fairly easily with no staining. I've used it with electric toothbrushes and manually. All brands seem to be the same.  update note: I've heard that it may be too abrasive for electric toothbrushes, in terms of wearing away enamel.  I've used it mainly with a manual brush.
B00538TSMU|5|Great deal.
B00518ZIF8|5|GOOD PRICE,EXCELLENT PRODUCT :)
B001DEYP8K|2|This is not a new unit. Refurbished or something. The battery does not last as long as the older one I own. Shaves well.
B00LNJWTHO|5|Fast shipping good product
B00DPTW8JY|1|Too heavy and big for my hair to support.
B00AHHVLM2|5|love this product ... and as always great transaction through Amazon ... Thanks Moroccan Oil hairspray is great quality .. just the hair spray I have been searching for even tho it is a little pricy
B00JFL4RC2|2|Beautiful but I lost it the  same week I received it. I would purchase another one but the shipping just takes to long. Kind of upset I misplaced it 😩
B00164E8TI|5|Works well. I no longer get a rash
B000BIXP4O|2|The old formula was great, but this one is not nearly as good.  I'm not sure what motivated the change but it is really disappointing and not nearly as good as the original
B000GLRREU|4|Messy!  But it does the job and is easy enough to use by younger kids.  Love all the attachments, the pause button on wand, and the 10 levels of water pressure.  Very easy to keep clean.
B002QI45Z0|4|This is my first shaving brush (just switched to wet shaving with a safety razor after 30 years of cartridge shaving), so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it seems well-made and works great. The brush holds lots of water and lather. My only gripe would be that the imitation ivory handle doesn't actually look like ivory. It's just a solid cream color. I prefer ivory with some natural striping. There also seems to be quite a bit of shedding, and while this is supposed to be normal I will have to monitor it to see if it stops or continues over time. This was a great first brush purchase that didn't break the bank.
B0085K6NXA|5|so I smelled this when one of my many roommates was wearing this around our place, I wasn't sure who it was since at the time we had 9 roomies, until one morning I saw her using it and realized it was this product. I rushed and ordered this cause it smelled amazing. I received it in no time and I LOVE IT! surprised axe could pull off such a great scent for women. *clapping*. Ive gotten a lot of compliments and really the most important is that I love it and boo thing does too! lol.
B00FKVJPC8|5|Love the Joico products! This comes out more as an aqua than a cobalt blue. I did this color for awhile and then mixed it with the Indigo and got this awesome electric blue color. Will continue buying these products!
B002Q8IHXQ|5|This is the best facial cleanser for the money on the market.  This cleanser is refreshing and gentle, with the right amount of exfoliating beads.  This product shipped fast and was exactly as described.
B00LVPDBA4|5|Good experience
B00CHJT6GQ|1|Received this item with the bottle completely empty of any actual contents. Paid for heat protection spray and received an empty plastic bottle. Unfortunately I am unable to comment on the actual effectiveness of this product as a heat protectant because whomever's job it was to put the product in the product container forgot to come to work that day apparently.
B00ASMUF82|5|great
B0075P0WW4|1|Its no good. It didn't work. It fell apart after one use. But it did fit it just din't work.
B004YBBIXE|5|Love it
B002Z7EOOE|4|I have very dry skin, naturally. It's not fun, it itches a lot!  Especially my back and the sides of my legs.  To make matters worse, my wife has compared my elbows to alligators, though I think they're more like crocodiles, but she's the animal expert between the two of us, so I'll let her decide.  Lotions have helped a little if I apply them immediately after a shower before starting to really dry up, but for the most part the elbowgator remains!  So, I decided to try this body wash to see if it would help... and...  wait for it..................... it did!<br /><br />This body wash lathers up really nicely and actually feels quite nice to use, certainly a lot silkier than \\"for men\\" products named after logging implements or expired herbs. Beware however, if you have soft water it will feel like it takes FOREVER to rinse off, though I'm sure it's already all rinsed off it just feels like it's still there. I know most body washes feel this way for me, but this one especially so! It is a bit perfumey which might not be your thing.  It certainly doesn't smell manly, but if I was worried about that I'd just, I dunno, roll in old pizza or something.  But the elbowgators and the itching from the dry skin seem to have been greatly alleviated.
B00JMJ6E5A|5|very very good
B00BSKJ6AG|3|I like all these products,  but they're no better than stuff I can buy at Walmart. The price for these at the mall is ridiculous ($50+) so I'm glad amazon has them reasonably priced. This is the first hair serum I've ever used and I like it, but it didn't wow me. The smell is strong and I didn't like it at first, but it smelled pretty good after it dried on my hair. I'm Polish with Caucasian naturally brunette hair, that is long and that I dye frequently. My current color is platinum blonde, so yes it is damaged. I occasionally style my hair and usually wash it every other day. I usually let it dry overnight, but sometimes I'll blow dry it on a low setting. I apply 3-4 pumps of this in my hands because I have long hair (mid-back length) and then apply it throughout my towel-dried hair. The smell is better once it dries and settles into my hair,  but it's not that great. The only thing I've noticed the serum helps with is making my hair softer. The shampoo and conditioner don't work any better than stuff I could get at walmart. These bottles are pretty small and they don't last me as long as normal sized shampoos and conditioners. I honestly like Suave Moroccan oil serum much better because it actually leaves my hair much shinier and softer, plus the smell is much better when settled into the hair. Plus,  it's only around $4 at Walmart.  Overall,  I think the herstyler serum and the shampoo and conditioner are way overpriced for their results,  especially at the mall. I don't think I will be buying these products again because I get much better results from Suave products for 1/3 of the price of these  even if herstyler is cheaper on amazon.
B00PSKTVO8|5|Ok, ok.  I think we're clear that we ALL were scammed on how this thing works.  I bought into the clever wording of the infomercial...no shaving, Sensa-Light Technology removes unwanted hair, blah blah blah.  Here's the deal, folks:  This thing is a shaver (at times I wonder if it's an epilator due to some slight &#34;ouch&#34; when areas are shaved, but I don't have an extra 40 bucks to take a unit apart and find out).  It is smaller than shavers offered to men.  Once I realized that it was a shaver, I understood then that I would not be using this for a whole-body shave.  Not a problem...I use men's electrical razors for that.<br /><br />I was finally diagnosed with PCOS 2 years ago...it went undiagnosed for 5 (men, it's a woman thing).  This has caused me to have a massive amount of hair on my chin, neck, cheeks, and a 'stache.  I tweeze, use hair-removing cream, sigh.  I was having to do this AT LEAST every other day.  If I didn't, it would become noticable to everyone...embarrassing, right?  It takes up a great deal of my time and just plain sucks.  I bought this little beauty.  And while I was ill at first for falling for the hype, I fell in love after the first use.<br /><br />Per instructions, I charged it for 2.5 hours.  I changed to the microfoil head since I was going to be working with stubble.  It was crazy insane how much hair this thing was getting!  I spent 20 minutes doing practically my whole face and neck.  When I was done, my face felt almost raw.  It scared me a bit by how red it had gotten.  I applied some lotion and after about 10 minutes, my face felt and looked fine.  But wait!  Holy bejeebus!  It felt great!!  I almost started crying because my face was smooth for the first time in 7 years!  No stubble, no ingrown hairs, no hairs stuck in skin.  Absolutely amazing!  I know now not to spend 20 minutes on it...lol.  Since the first night, I take about 5 minutes to grab what little has grown.<br /><br />I have had this unit for almost a week and I am so glad that I've got it.  We're going to be great partners :-).  Now, I have no problem letting my man touch and caress my face.  Now, I'm not afraid of people getting close.  It's a great feeling.  Thank you, FT Yes!!
B00JYE5576|5|Great product,  bought it for my hubby and it worked great for him
B003ILUQPM|4|I got these when I went to Canada and my host's sister would do my nails with one of these every night. It's cool! It takes some practice to get used to applying it so that it's actually visible, but it isn't hard.
B00JGQBNLY|5|Great
B006UET4XE|4|This isn't the best liquid liner in the world, I am sure, but it works just as well as other much more expensive brands I have tried. The only gripe I have is that it tends to sort of melt or smear at the outside corners of my eyes after several hours. I bet that applying an eyeshadow prep before putting this on would help, but I'm not trying to add yet another cosmetic to my crowded makeup bag.
B00L10F3E6|5|Excellent product. Use for makeup as well as face painting. Comfortable to hold. Easy to clean
B004RRDNQK|5|I was so glad to find this online.  It's my favorite product for my curly hair and Redken has changed the formula and scent, neither of which now works for me.  So finding this online was a hair saver!
B005OYDID8|5|Just got it in time for my next shave thanks to Amazon Prime, shaves smooth left my face like baby skin lol, I immediately used the ultra clean foil though. Tip: be very careful when pulling out the foils from the packaging they are very light like foil paper, they are not a solid metal foil like my previous Braun's, I almost broke mine when taking it out. So far I just used it for my face n neck but will be trying it for a bald fade on the sides soon.
B004I5D5EG|5|Super fast delivery and product just like it would be in stores thanks so much it's awesome
B00336EUTK|5|This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.
B002CVTVUA|5|Although not recommended for children so young, we use this on our 2 year old daughter. It works wonderfully, quickly and efficiently removing stains and tartar that had built up on her teeth during her first years. She even enjoys (ineffectively) brushing her own teeth with it.  The brush takes a beating and keeps working.  I know of nothing else in the same league as this toothbrush.
B000WUD83E|2|I selected this product for the benefits of shea.  I was looking for a product that would gently clean and leave facial skin soft.  At first, it did leave my skin feeling soft.  But after a few morning washings, my face began to itch.  Let me state that I do not have sensitive skin.  So I caution those of you who do to be careful about using this product.  Opinions can differ as to the pleasantness of a smell, but this product does have a very strong, aggressive smell.<br /><br />I am not throwing it in the garbage since the manufacturer said that you can \\"use 4 parts water to 1 part Dr. Woods to clean dishes, floors, counters, and more!\\"  Wow, a product for my face can be used to clean the floor?
B001KYU1H2|5|This really helped with my post pregnancy stretch marks. My skin is not completely back to normal (I know it won't be), but it's greatly improved from what it looked like.
B0068G1PJ0|5|I have been using this product for years.  Really helps to define curls and lessen the frizz from NJ summer days.
B00CQ1XJR2|5|I am worried that would break very thin product thickness.<br /> But the advantage is thin and light.<br /> Daughter so comfortable to use.<br /> Above all, this beautiful design, good quality.
B0037TM252|5|This is a great product! I definitely recommend it. Due to some stress in my life, and being genetically predisposed to Alopecia, I began to loss tons of hair! So I began try out several products in the hopes of finding something that would prove to stop the hair loss and/or promote regrowth. After arduous research and several attempts, I came across some research on Minoxidil. This chemical was first used in the 70's to treat high blood pressure. The people began to grow a lot of hair and the scientists created a topical solution that when applied promotes blood flow on the capillaries and therefore brings the necessary nutrients to the hair bulb to ensure it's growth. This product does a great job at infusing Minoxidil with other vitamins and DHT blockers that create a powerful effect. I recommend applying it every day and the results are noticeable after 3 months of daily use. After a year to a year and a half there is a substantial difference.
B00HRGBAT0|1|It's not working.
B00336EUTK|4|That's all that needs to be said.  One small criticism (which cost them a fifth star) would be that peeling them off of the backing isn't the easiest thing in the world and I lost a strip, but other than that, if you stick with using these, they're terrific.
B00373HS7K|5|Just received the brush yesterday and tried it this morning.  The other reviews are right--one of the softest brushes ever!  I can't believe how smooth and soft it feels (and how I put up with a scratchy brush for so long).  I will say that I still used my scratchy flat top powder brush to pick up my loose mineral powder and pack onto my skin, then used this brush buff and blend in.  This brush picks up less product and therefore gives a more natural finish.  I know I'll use it daily for blending and would highly recommend this as a must-have for anyone who wears makeup.
B000OL95DS|5|My wife's favorite color, a shame they discontinued making it.
B00ISEOY20|5|I love it
B0044H44P2|1|It was so rusty when I got it.  I was going to give it as a present but looks like it is in bad shape.
B00KSLK86M|5|My gripe with most natural lip balms is they are hard, and constantly found myself having to re-apply every 15 mins. Most peppermint scented ones tend to be harsh or sting when using.  Not the case with Beauty by Earth. I've been rather obsessed with this balm since breaking it out of the package. I can't wait until they run out so I can check out their additional scents. I highly recommend this lip balm.
B000GAO94C|5|I've had permed hair for a few years now.  I've tried what seems like every salon and non-salon product out there to try and make my curls look nice without a lot of work.  This is the best product I've found. The spray dispensing makes it super easy to use and travel with, it lasts quite some time (I have long thick hair), and makes my curls look great with only minimal scrunching.
B003RUOMHC|5|Today I got The WAHL HERO for personal use and to use on family and friends...This thing is the perfect size and has alot of power(Does not Vibrate to much). I zero gapped it and it cuts crisp shape ups!!! I used other Trimmers before such as ANDIS styliner M3 and the T outliner, The M3 vibrates way to much and gets hot way to quick and really heavy, The T_Outliner vibrates to much and gets hot after 5 min.<br /><br />In comparison the WAHL HERO cuts a more sharper line than both the ANDIS i used before, but without the bulkiness and heat. Which is good when shaping up a whole head and beard.<br /><br />This thing has power, Wahl states that it has as much power as the ANDIS MASTER full size clipper!!! BEAST<br /><br />THIS ALSO HAS A NEW BLADE OUT. The T-Wide blade which is wider than the standard blade. I will get this so i can cut a faster shape up.
B000WF293O|5|This has a very great smell, strong at first but gets real mellow. love it.
B0023USWEG|5|Shipped fast. Smells amazing!
B00JJPMXDO|5|Recommended by my dermatologist and like it!
B003XKW8RM|5|Just love this, smells wonderful too!M
B00OA431J4|1|The only reason to purchase this is if you don't know how to use a curling iron. This curler does not make a tight curl at all. The curl falls out extremely quick and it doesn't curl all the way to your ends if you have really long hair. NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!
B003JH7HIO|3|Decent sparkle and hold for a chemical filled eye shadow. I've had amazing results with chemical free makeup and for the first time I don't break out anymore, so switching to beneficial ingredient makeups is my way these days.
B001AMQJAW|3|The product is fine - the expiration date for such a big bottle was OK for a professional hair dresser, not a single customer.  The seller should have disclosed the expiration date on their advertisement.
B00BIL9HZE|4|Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel. hvnt used it, Seems good for this price from Nivea. Been always using Gillette so far
B0012BNVE8|1|very poor quality does not work.Paul
B004RXFIUI|1|It works in long run but the product is kinda pricy. I would like it if they can lower the price...
B0017DGOE0|5|Love the smell and the beads definitely feel exfoliating but not too rough!<br />Was introduced to this product when i recieved a facial and i started using it with a clarisonic brush.. WOW my skin feels soooo smooth!!
B0042SJWYG|4|It smells OK，not really like cool water series, but have actual effect for the function. I'm kind of like it.
B00EP2P3ME|2|I'm real sorry to have to give a negative review. I was really hoping for results. I am a male late 60s and my hair was getting thin on top. I tried various products. I had an instinctive feeling that some kind of oil would be the answer, so this product seemed like it.<br />Today I found the statement by the company that it doesn't work on male pattern baldness. End of story.
B003NS38EG|5|This is by far the best smelling sunscreen I've ever used.  It is extremely easy to apply and goes on evenly when sprayed.
B006IBM21K|4|Works well, and it's a good investment.
B0027LSEPS|5|Amazing water pressure. Portable and no special batteries required. Nice.
B002W1PJSI|5|Love White Shoulders,  Its an old scent that never goes out of style.  The bath powder is very nice also.
B007APTJ0U|5|Love how smooth it feels and how it looks, though in the picture it looks like a dark red, it's actually a little brighter, other than that I love it!
B003IMFZ4I|5|NYX lipsticks are so moisturizing.  This color, Opal, is very sheer, and can be worn alone or under or on top of other lipsticks.<br />I am disappointed that NYX appears to be discontinuing this color, since I can't find it on their website anymore:(<br />One thing to note:  the shades shown online seem to be completely different to the actual color when you receive the product, so be careful what you order.
B001PAEYY2|5|love the scent! and it leaves the skin feeling clean without drying or oiliness its great for shaving too, if im out of everything MaryKay or out of nothing it is the first thing i order ....LOVE THIS STUFF!! nothing compares
B00454ZTEO|5|It's easy and cheaper to stock up as these things get used up in less that 2 months with daily use.
B000FLJU1O|5|This is the second time I have purchased this product.  I use this oil every day and like it very much.
B00L9XPBN8|5|Awesome product! Makes my skin feel so smooth and moisturized.  Love the fragrance - it is fresh and citrusy.
B00HLZ8SG0|1|Doll hair
B0045VN0G6|5|Best flat iron I ever have, I red the rewius about it but I never thought I found it my most important tool for my every day hair.<br />I can´t live with out it.
B001QJWIKE|5|LOVE HOW THIS MAKES MY HAIR FEEL
B000H4DIKI|1|Major problem was that although the product was labeled \\"On Going Flame, the  product inside was \\"very Cherry\\", not what I wanted or needed.  Second problem was no info on how to return it or what to do. Third problem..it took them two weeks to ship a tube of lipstick!?  I was going out of town, so I just gave up.  Won't buy there again.
B002SYXHTC|5|I LOVE this stuff! It works well and smells amazing. If you like a strong scent this great. Originally I came across this at a beauty supply store but it was quite costly. Through Amazon here it was much more affordable.
B00CAWLOG0|5|Awesome product highly recommend!!!
B00GLCU1QY|5|Very nice cleansing brush, affordable, and something I've incorporated into my nightly routine. I've never had another facial brush to compare it to, however...
B0095JIM8O|2|Leakage in the mall doesnt smell like the real deal
B00H4OIDP4|5|Love it use it every day.  Did get at wallmart  but I can no longer find it there .
B00CHCM4P8|5|This product is amazing for damaged hair. I've recommended it and sold it before. BUT I must warn you, this product works best on CAUCASIAN HAIR. Damaged African American hair does not mix well with this. It can feel and appear dry. Be careful!
B0018A32XS|4|This was a gift and it is doing its job. I was surprised to see how well it removes leg hair.
B00HDH94K0|5|Love it! I bought the lotion at Marshall's and decided to give the perfume a try and I really enjoy the smell.
B000VEQLHQ|5|Actually, this is a replacement mirror for one I'd had over 15 years.  The only reason it needed replacing was due to my dropping it on a tiled floor.  The 15x magnification is perfect for tweezing and finding any area of your face that may need attention. The mirror detaches easily for travel.
B00068F15K|3|For the price it's alright. It is super loud, and it will &#34;get you&#34; every now and then if you use it on your neck (not enough to draw blood, but it'll leave a red mark for a while.) The guards are too short for my liking. If I were to guess, the longest is prob a 3 mm. It does cut hair decently well though.
B007KQCQ2M|5|Great
B0014JV6ZO|5|Been using it for years and it works great.
B008B9Y0EY|5|I've been mixing it in water in a spray bottle and using it as a tick repellent.  So far so good.
B00J2APFMW|1|How raw hamburger looks is how your face will feel after using this over priced razor. It is so unwieldy you have to go over and over your beard to get a clean shave and as a result your skin is raw!<br /><br />I was so disappointed with this razor; I threw it and the extra blade in the trash (re-cycle bin) after three uses.<br /><br />I would like to meet the suckers who have given this praise and sell them a piece of the Brooklyn Bridge.
B009UF5JNY|2|I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this mask. It smelled fantastic and the packaging was too cute. However, it made my skin burn - I ended up having to wash it off prematurely. And, unfortunately, it ended up breaking me out - I'm still working on undoing the damage from it. It has peppermint oil in it, I believe, which caused my skin irritation.
B003987CL0|5|This newest model of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor is the best yet.  It is light weight, easy to maneuver and delivers a better shave than my electric razor which is now gathering dust in the drawer.  The only real negative about the ProGlide razor is my son kept stealing mine so I finally had to buy one for him.<br /><br />I received a free Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor to evaluate through a consume program run by Gillette.  Our household likes it so much we have switched to using it exclusively.
B00CHMWAY8|5|This is first time buying and using raw Shea. I have very sensitive and dry skin, and so far this is fantastic. Thick but not oily. Moisturizing without any irritation or break outs. Love it.
B004SBIFD6|3|not quite secure enough to keep water from running down neck area,
B000C1VTLQ|5|very nice. thank you
B004X7651E|5|I like this.  It's light weight and is really good for twists and a general hair dress.  It's very inexpensive and all of the products in this line works the same to me and is worth a try, especially for two strand twists.
B00HJDIAGC|5|Putting the gel on my teeth with the tray system is a dream. Strips are a hassle and often fall off. This product does not. It delivers on all accounts. I am recommending this and purchasing more. My smile looks great and I feel confident in my entire look now.
B00BFTYX3K|5|More colorful than pictured. It looks white in the picture, but actually has quite a bit of color in it. Light weight and well made.
B00V7FLV82|5|Only soap to cut the grease from hands!
B005SPU6UQ|4|Smashbox never fails to give a nice palette with good pigment. I'm glad I bought it. I use the cream eyeliners as eyeshadow base as well.
B0049U660K|5|Only need a dab.... Very thick stuff but holds great!
B002VWJEKW|4|For the price worked great!!
B000GGKQ9S|5|Great!!!
B0048KSGZO|4|Definitely helps keep unruly brows in place.
B00KPF3BAQ|5|Would recommend to get an extra set
B001272JCM|5|This a gook shaving brush for the price. If you are new at shaving with a straight edge or double edge this is a good brush to start as it is cheaper than the badger brushes and it give you a chance to start until you can make up your mind on what brush you would like to use.
B00A40XXV4|5|My wife picked this out for a Birthday present to replace one that she had broken.  Turns out it was an excellent choice.  She highly recommends this mirror for travel and use at home.  She particularly likes how it folds so compactly, multiple mirrors and lights.
B002T3V294|5|The brushes are great and for this price even better. I really love them they're good quality and the packaging is great for traveling. Don't regret this purchase :)
B00F0IWQNG|5|I bought this scarf as a give away at Christmas time for my sisters. We love scarfs.  Any kind of scarf is perfect for us.  The cat print is beautiful.
B000AA5VVI|5|Delivery was fast and the item was what I wanted
B00ALMAU3Y|5|The Soap had a beautiful aroma and was delivered in perfect shape and very quickly! It was part of a &#34;gift exchange&#34; package and all present at the party raved about the wonderful scent!
B005CHHO46|5|I have used it three times and already have very little growth. I love not having to shave daily. Love it!
B004R6HIR6|4|Handy all in one makeup! Makes my skin soft, and evens blotchy skin. My eyes burned from it at first (I am loaded with allergies) but after a few days of use, this went away. I have rosacea, large pores, dry skin, and age discolorations. have alternated using L'Oreal's BB creme and this product. Both cover well, this one a bit better. This creme left my skin feeling moister, and a bit less shiny. I used the pink and black samples that came with this product, and I believe I will purchase the black diamond, as it covered my pores much better.
B001D71BXY|5|Very good
B005TI4L12|1|I found this at the dollar store. Chipped in less than 24 hours. Tried it again and it did the same thing I followed the directions! Dont waste your money!
B00IZB0AII|1|Do not waste money
B00D13C9V6|5|Love the color and the fact that it stays put. Fast shipping.
B0055WNFXW|5|This is a great all in one traveling bag. It's roomy but not too big. I love the easy access to everything. It was perfect for my trip. The shipping was fast and it's worth the cost.
B00SO3UB7C|5|Love this little scrubber, it makes your face feel so clean and soft. Gets all the dead skin off. I use it then put my moisturizer on for the night. Looks good in the morning.
B003156NP2|3|To help you get my perspective, I'm 39. I have combination skin-my cheeks are dry, while my forehead and nose get shiny easily. My complexion is on the light side of medium, if that makes sense. I've been looking for a high-quality sunblock that has 3% avobenzone in it, dries clear-not like clown makeup-and gives a matte finish, or at least close to matte.<br /><br />This isn't it. Not for me, anyway.<br /><br />This product, like just about every other sunblock I've tried, makes my face look ultra-shiny/greasy. It also shows a white sheen on my face even after having worn it a few hours. I will say it does so less noticeably than other sunblocks by Neutrogena. It does, as other reviews have stated, go on easily and smoothly-it's a thin liquid compared to most other like products you've encountered. It also doesn't sting and is quite comfortable to wear.<br /><br />I work outdoors throughout my workday, so I know I'll be going through the bottles I purchased. I appreciate knowing I'm using a reliable product that's easy to work with. That being said, it's not what I'll be smearing on my face for social occasions that call for air-kissing people.
B004FKNYWW|5|Best mask from skin food.. Getting my third bottler soon. smell nice
B002ZNJI9Y|3|This mannequin head lasted a very long time, but after a while the hair started to tangle a LOT, and it started to become very frustrating to braid it. Other than that, I thought it was a great mannequin head for a very long time, and I recommend it over the real haired ones, they don't last as long.
B0012F97EM|5|My wife was and still thrilled over Gold N Hot  Stove and at a great price She Thanks You.
B001ECQ4ZS|5|Why did Dove discontinue this item?  It works great and smells so good I won't use perfume.  It has a wonderful fragrance, light and fresh.  I'll keep ordering until they are all gone.
B008UXYQ8G|5|Love this lipstick! Great buy.
B00EU8PYHC|2|I received the shorts and it was not like picture I looking at. It was not cuff at the legs. they were fringe at the legs and just been stitch. Who ever did the sewing did not do a good job a I was not happy. the button hole was close up. I could have got a pair of jeans an just cut them myself. I was expecting the shorts to look just like that picture at looking at right now. And it did not look any thing like that .
B008Q0E714|5|I store all of my plates in this product, it's well made and easy to pack away.  No complaints whatsoever!
B0046HO8ZG|1|Doesn't spray!  It's like the gel is too thick for the pump.  Don't waste your money.
B00JXZ4L4O|5|Wonderful product!!! I puchased this because I'd read that it works very well in gently cleansing and conditioning artists brushes. However; I loved how it left my hands feeling... very soft, with no sticky soap residue so, I began useing it for bathing as well and just absolutely love it.
B004N2EYY4|1|After just a few min the motor slows all the way down until it finally just stops....and after a few times using it it does it everytime I use it now..
B000N3PF7M|1|Dissappointing.  Referred by Food Babe and left my hair feeling like straw.  The leave-in conditioner left my hair feeling stiff and unnatural.  I don't recommend this product.
B004H53CW2|5|Finally, something that really works! It's so hard to find though...nothing thus far has met its match as far as results go!
B0073A39AI|4|As far as coverage goes, you need to wear more of this than I would have liked to. It does feel light. And the color is great. I also believe that it has helped my skin since I started using it. As far as tinted moisturizers go, for the price this is a good one.
B0076K07DC|5|Just as expected.
B004IQA2W8|5|This is the 3rd half-gallon I've purchased.<br /><br />Bamboo Luminous Shine products are fantastic, and work great on my hair.<br /><br />In this size, it's a BARGAIN (check the price in salons), and I love the sturdy pump.
B00ISOYMY0|3|Ehh, the color was more red than violet.
B004RSF08I|2|Product arrived on time but the quality was less then desired. The cut was poor and shapeless. I did not wear it as expected, thankfully my girlfriend found another wig for me to wear.
B000EPJNMW|5|This is my third set of these!  I love them - the most recent purchase will be my travel set.  They fit nicely in luggage without taking up space.  I have a set for home that I use everyday.  It is the perfect size - the rollers heat up quick.  One aspect I really like it the smooth surface of the roller so there is no pulling of the hair, etc.<br /><br />Great product!
B000F63TW0|1|Let me start out by saying I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.  This burned and gave me a fever 3 days after the treatment.  I didn't notice any effects and I followed the instructions word for word.  I did a lot of research on this product before I purchased it and it had a lot of great reviews so I went to Target and purchased it while on sale.  This might work for some people but not people with sensitive skin.
B000GLRREU|5|Overall, I am satisfy with Waterpik Jet.  although the tank is small, but I don't see that as a problem.  just adding water few times in 1 use, other wise it works great and makes me feel good about my oral hygiene.  I like it alot
B003TJG4XG|5|Claudia Stevens Olive Oil Formula Body Lotion is a great facial moisturizer, as well as, body lotion.  It is the only product that I can use on my face that doesn't cause skin irritations.  I am so glad that I found this product on your site.
B003UAZB7E|5|Awesome product, unbeatable price!
B005MTK4RI|5|Even if you put too much it never feels oily and it goes great when you use it with heat tools. I recommend!
B007VCT0D8|2|Works well but c'mon you are paying for the brand not the product. Look elsewhere for something that is just as good.
B00HQA3G1M|3|Really natural-looking color, however it tangles and frays really easily and it is difficult to keep on my head without it slipping off. Overall okay for my first wig.
B00A8I8AVA|5|No more flaky hair gel for me.  The Tamanu works great without the hard gel buildup
B0001ZYL3Q|5|This cream was recommended to me  to help survive the pain of shingles. For three weeks I have had the burning and pain in my throat and ear canal. As soon as the Neem Cream from Theraneem Organic arrived, I applied a generous amount to the area around my ear and on my neck.  Within a very short time, the pain had decreased significantly and I have used it since.  It only takes a dab, as it is very creamy and a little goes a long way...It is quickly absorbed into the skin and is very soothing.  It also makes a wonderful face and body cream. I have been using it on my face and within a week my husband commented on how my wrinkles had disappeared somehow...(my new secret weapon!) I don't know that the cream will cure the shingles, but anything that makes the pain more bearable is important to me....Great product.
B00JB2MS44|5|Fast shipment; excellent flavor; easy transaction.  Thx!
B003BMPCMK|5|best for exfoliating
B00564ES7Q|5|I have this on my desk at work, and I just love it.  I have received so many comments on the scent.  I have to share it with my daughter. worth the price!!!<br />Works for me
B007SNGSFS|5|Hubby loves his shaver and this cleaning option.  Cartridges last a reasonable amount of time with daily use and are easy to replace.
B00081NFH6|5|This tray is such a nice accent to my dressing area. Perfume bottles really sparkle on it. If you love pretty perfume bottles, this is a nice way to display them.
B001DYM5WI|4|These softee towels were a little thinner than I had hoped but otherwise they were as described. They<br />shipped quickly and I received on time and in good condition.
B00H8AK046|2|This seems to be an acrylic set, I was wanting something like SNS where there is no smell, this kit made my eyes water and smelled up my house.  If you are ok with that then enjoy.  I would return but I opened the canisters to get started and then smelled the bottles, one of which the brush fell off of and another leaked from the lid all over my hands.
B004UL0GTK|5|THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME AMAZING HAIR!!! BEST PRODUCT FOR THOSE LOOSE BEACH WAVES WITHOUT GOING IN THE OCEAN. I USE MY DIFFUSER ON THIS AND HAVE NATURALLY WAVES HAIR- THIS INTENSIFIES AND MAKES IT LOOK SO GOOD. WILL BE ORDERING MORE OF THIS AND A MUST HAVE FOR ALL HAIR TYPES. MY FRIENDS WITH STRAIGHT HAIR COME OVER AND USE MINE AND IT LOOKS SO GOOD WITH THE LOOSE WAIVE.. IVE TRIED THE NEW TRESAME UNCURLED PRODUCT AND THIS PRODUCT WORKS SO MUCH BETTER AND WILL EVEN LAST YOU LONGER
B0086XSK8W|4|I decided to switch to henna because other dyes were damaging my hair. I take this to my hair dresser and my hair looks great and is in good condition. My only objection is that it is a little bit pricy especially because it needs to be used often.
B00BQ1Z9F8|2|These &#34;generic&#34; toothbrush heads do not even come with covers for the heads.  I had to wash our old ones and keep them, so we could use them on these heads.  We all have a terrible time trying to remove the heads from the toothbrush handle, usually prying it off with a pair of scissors.  Other than that, they work okay, except I had to throw one away 2 weeks after I started using it, because it had black mold on it!  I have never had that happen before, and I rinse the brush well after every use!
B0043D68YW|1|We switched from another brand to use these when our normal brand was sold out. Turns out, I'm allergic to these. It was only after I started coughing and feeling like I had acid reflux (which was actually my throat swelling I found out later) that I figured it out. This went on for months until I finally put 2-and-2 together!! Apparently, these types of wipes have certain chemicals that can affect alot of people. Fortunately, my throat didn't completely close up or I would have been up a creek. Since this scare, I've decided to go back to regular soap and water (not antibacterial). It's safest and doesn't increase the risk of weakening the effectiveness of antibiotics when we need them. Makes me wonder how many people are treated for allergies, asthma, and/or acid reflux and it was a product like this all along?!
B001V9OWIU|5|Good product, especially for the price.  Saves a fortune compared to tanning salon spray tans.  Only problem I have with this product is that the neck of the bottle is very narrow, making it somewhat difficult to return unused solution after a spray session.
B00166G1SM|3|Great service. Great product!
B00G9W5BXE|5|Sturdy and well made
B005OZOL0G|5|Love it. My favorite color so far. Great product: moisture level, smell, packaging.. it's all good! It's difficult to choose the right colors, but this one works for me and I have dark brown hair, brown eyes and fair skin.
B0047QIE7O|2|I hoped this bar would last for at least a couple of weeks on a backpack trip.  The soap does lather but left my hair dry.  It worked fine to wash clothes but melted away quickly.  I did like the pouch, it worked as far as keeping my other items dry.
B002XURD32|5|Where has this thing been all my life?    I can't imagine being without it now  that I have it.  My skin could not be  cleaner, I love the Clarisonic!
B003V265QW|5|All of the rave reviews about this product are true! I've had this wand for about six months and I'm so glad I was able to get a styling tool that works so well for such a good price! I could never work a curling iron, but it is so easy with the Remington wand... I've finally found the right tool to get my hair exactly the way I've always wanted! Right now I own the 1/2 inch wand, which is great for springy spirals with lots of volume, and I'm seriously considering getting the larger version for big, loose waves. You definitely get your money's worth with this wand!! :)
B00CY3BZGO|2|I was slightly disappointed with this because when it came in a few of the colors were very thick and sticky,like they were old. It doesn't dry very well and just looks very cheap. I've given these to my 5 year old because they are just not worth it for me to use. They arrived on time and packaged nicely but the product itself is crap.
B0000AFUT3|1|I was given a mirror such as this from a friend who had since she was a teenager. when she gave it to me she was 48 and I've had for about 10 years after. Then it finally retired. So I bout this new one just like it. It only lasted six months. first the mirror failed then the plug attached to the mirror failed. Things these day are not made to last. Won;t buy another again.
B007P9YCWQ|5|I don't write reviews often, and it's only for the products I'm wild about.  Here we go: I've been using the light therapy for nearly three months.  The first week I'd put lotion and oil on and use the lights and after several days it looked like I had sunburn/heat rash.  So I went away from it for it for a good week to let things calm down.<br /><br />I then started using it for 20-ish minutes in the morning (dry skin using each color a good 6 minutes), then I'd wash up and carry on my morning routine.  After a good 2 or 3 weeks the redness and scarring on my cheeks lightened and well, my skin tone is just brighter and more even.  I've had acne prone skin for more than 20 years (food alergies was the main culprit)  and this light has helped my skin look better than ever.  Even if I have a few breakouts, the light clears it up fast and fades the scars quickly, which is unheard of for me.  I'm going to stick with it, it's great!
B002Y2HUL4|3|I only used this for the first time last night, which is why i only gave it 3 stars.  So far, i love love the smell of this conditioner. i placed on a plastic shower cap after applying and left on for about half an hour.  When i removed the cap and rinsed my hair i immediately noticed that my hair color looked a lot richer and darker in color. I have natural d hair so my natural color started to look very dull and very dry.  I must admit i saw an immediate result.  I am very curious on this line and will be looking to purchase other products. seems to be a winner thus far!
B0080EEMCA|5|I have oily-combination skin that's prone to adult acne and I've tried so many moisturizers. I've been looking for one that will moisturize enough so that I don't get random dry patches but won't moisturize too much so that I'm even more oily. I tried this product on a whim since my usual moisturizer ([[ASIN:B00C2QROVS Origins GinZing Energy boosting moisturizer, 1.7 fl oz]]) had run out and I needed another one quick (also, I saw that EXO was promoting it so I thought, why not? haha).<br /><br />Anyway, Kyungsoo from EXO was definitely right when he said \\"it makes my hands feel like water.\\" It's a clear gel that feels like a liquid when it goes on your skin. A little definitely goes a *long* way with this product especially because the container it comes in is HUGE. It's so big that I had to put some in a smaller travel-size container for daily use. When it dries on your skin, it creates an extremely thin film. I was using this on my face for a while and I thought it was fine but I couldn't stand it on my body because the film feels a bit stiff. The scent is not very strong in my opinion, unlike what many of the other reviewers said. It smells like the typical cucumber-melon scent (the scent that used to be all the rage for body wash) but I can only smell it slightly when the container is open. I can't smell it at all even when it's on my face.<br /><br />All in all, it's a very light moisturizer. If you have very dry skin then I don't recommend this because I don't think it'll be strong enough. This is the perfect moisturizer for preventing dry skin in the milder seasons and especially during summertime due to its refreshing nature.
B00EN3EB8M|5|Scandalous Shenanigans! I can't stop saying it! Love it! Awesome name! Awesome color!
B00JPCN7TK|5|I wish I could get these here, but they came and left...very good product
B00GOJMIWO|5|These brushes deserve a 5star rating!!!! I bought them for my daughter who will soon be getting long hair, but I tested them out on my very fine hair and I lalalalalove them! They are A-MAZING! A++++ Definitely worth the price! Don't hurt or pull my hair.  Will definitely keep this brand in mind for the future when I need more!
B00C7VVMFW|5|I love how soft my face is after applying this product after using the facial peel.  It is light and has a soft fragrance to it.  My skin looks younger and stays hydrated during the day.  Love it!!!
B004W1GRKK|5|Good
B0009V1YS2|1|After reading reviews and watching some videos i decided to invest in an expensive Flat Iron. My CHI Turbo flat iron was broken when i received it. I think some electronic component was broken inside and i could hear it when i shook the flat iron. Since i was traveling abroad when i got my CHI, i didn't have time to return it or contact the seller. I gave it a try and used it. It worked alright first time. While i was using it second time i saw flames and was terrified that either i will get a shock or burn my hair. Luckily nothing happened and i stopped using it. Maybe this product is good (i have done enough research on this product and it has good reviews), but i was unlucky and got a bad one. I think the seller didn't send me a good one and also the packaging was not like my other Amazon orders. It was wrapped up in a brown paper with a regular print out of my order. I had my CERAMIC 1 INCH FLAT IRON as a back up and i would highly recommend it which is just 50$.
B00006IV3K|5|My husband bought the exact trimmer over 12 years ago! We have been married for 12 years and he had it when I married him. He liked it so much he had me purchase the same one.  I was very happy to be able to find it. It can hold a charge for over a week. It is a great trimmer, highly recommend to all the guys out there.
B00HSNWZKU|5|So I have horrible winter dandruff, every year since I was a kid.  Full on flake fest.  Hate it but its true.<br />Needless to say I have tried many many products over the years and am always willing to try something new.<br />Truth is most products are a trade off, usually the tea-tree shampoos work by simply making my flakes smaller so they are still there but not as noticeable. The Head and shoulders type products all use the same  Pyrithione zinc (1%)  as an active ingredient, and you will find it here to. And the Nuke-em product of the dandruff world TAR. (yep I said it tar.) which works in extreme cases but smells like ...well tar..and leaves you with no flakes but hair that hates you.<br /><br />The regular everyday products seem to help but do note eliminate my dandruff, and worst off they seem to leave my hair scorched and dried out over time (anything more than a week.) I find myself alternating between a dandruff shampoo and a regular shampoo in an effort to have normal looking hair without the dandruff. It works maybe 6 months out of the year...then the cold season sets in and forget it...flake city.<br /><br />This time it was different. This shampoo works on all fronts.  I found my hair was great even after 2 weeks of daily use...no need to switch back and forth to avoid dried out look, and the flakes were gone....like totally gone.  Ok so I am surprised an perplexed but happy.  It has the same active ingredient to start with but whatever comes next seems to work...<br /><br />A great product that I will be buying regularly.
B0015PGFQW|5|She loves this product and says &#34;it's the best, it will stand your hair straight on end without making it sticky&#34;
B00D7J5GBY|3|Smells nice, not my favorite, also not very strong.  Lasts only an hour or so if that.  You'll probably get through the whole bottle within a few weeks because its weak and doesn't last requiring constant respray
B0045IZ9Z4|5|They work well.  I would purchase again.  It does what it is suppose to.
B0009H04LO|5|Color looks natural but has a little sparkle for the cheek color.  The bronzer is very sheer and also looks natural.  Would buy this again.
B001RGNZTE|5|I was introduced to this product in the NICU when my son had a horrible raw diaper rash. no other cream or remedy worked, but this stuff cleared it up in a day. Literally. it coats and protects the area. it does kind of ball up into little bits after a while but putting a coating of a&d or petroleum jelly over it helps with that. and besides, you don't need to use it for long, so it's all good!
B000VUX0BK|5|The company delivered the product on time and offered me a discount on further purchases. They were helpful and also included suggestions for the future.
B001CJE0MC|3|I've tried several sports sunscreens and i am yet to find one that does not make me look like casper when i start to sweat.<br /><br />Pros: It is light weight<br />Con: When i sweat my face is the same color as the product and it drips into my eyes and stings.
B008MZJF3I|5|Seems to be what I generally purchase as far as ingredients. The batch I got seems to originate in a country that doesn't require product weight to be listed on the label. But that's an observation, not a complaint.
B009B2Y4IC|5|this purse is everything I'd hoped! Awesome color which is true to picture, fast shipping and good packaging. It has plenty of room for all of my stuff. Had a slight chemical odor when I first opened it,.. though that is the nature of the beast. I only wish the strap was longer.
B00F5FDUDO|5|Love this product leaves my skin feelin wonderful make great hosted gifts ect<br />Going to order a few to hv on hand
B00BKXFFZ6|5|Light and perfect size for notebook phones! Very cute and can change strap. You can use as a clutch or mini make up bag or phone and case holder!
B005IUXIHY|4|Good shower cap, and you can recycle it several times until its completely used. I bought for my mom and she like it!!
B005237NA0|5|I was worried it was going to be the broad spectrum, but I received the original formula. I hope Neutrogena will bring back the original formula because I don't like the new broad spectrum.
B0026IV0WQ|4|This product is excellent, as most OPI AXXIUM products are.  However, doing get manicures on yourself can be very time consuming and challenging if you are not ambidextrous.
B00011QTZI|4|I love this brush, it has a great hold capacity for bangs specially.  I have really long hair so I use the larger one for the rest of the head.  A feature that I appreciate is that hair does not get tangled up in it.
B002JCSLXA|5|The moment I applied this product to my face, I felt absorption and renewal taking place. I thought to myself, wow - that's a new one for me. In trusting my instincts, I allowed myself to accept this fact. And in fact, the product has diminished some of my sun spots, as well as cleared my face of minor acne. I'm moving on to the MyChelle Apple Brightening Mist product - it got rave reviews. As for the oil separating like the other reviewer was mentioning... that did not happen to me but it is an oily product. Probably not good for oily faces!
B00853EK28|5|I love this little Kabuki brush! It is so soft and easy to clean.
B000V54TN8|5|cannot find these locally. luv these!
B010CBSEXG|4|Very nice--I may order another.
B00ISDOYV2|4|I made a cellulite scrub and have only been using it for less than a week, so I haven't gotten results yet, but I am hopeful that this scrub will lessen my cellulite.
B00GMAWI66|4|This is a good quality product and I got it for a fraction of what I would pay for other brands.  Additionally, the seller went out its way to follow up with me, educate me with the many uses of the product in a follow up email, the product was delivered very quickly, and packaged well.  A+ service, Amazon and AriaStarrBeauty!<br /><br />I am new to Argan oil.  I've used it pre-mixed into other commercial products (hair serum, shampoo, body butter) but have never used it as a stand alone serum or treatment.  I have very dry, sensitive skin and winter is just around the corner (be aware, though, this product is often marketed to those with oily skin as a balancer so this &#34;dry&#34; oil can benefit people with different needs).  I need more moisture generally, and specifically at this time of year, so I was looking at other serums, capsules, and creams.  I came across this randomly on Amazon and being on a bit more of a natural beauty kick lately, I decided to buy this and try it out.<br /><br />At the same time, I am trying to transition back into retinol use after a year's hiatus. My skin isn't in its best shape, but this argan oil mixed with my firming serum in the morning helps the serum to glide into the skin during application and makes a smoother base before I apply sunsceen and foundation.  I apply the oil lightly to irritated areas throughout the day when I am at home.  This has calmed and kept my upper cheeks, forehead, and nose/eye areas moisturized while my skin's working through adapting to the retinol again. The argan oil is great if you are applying a thick handcream and plan to wear gloves for a bit.  For people like me with very dry, sensitive skin and increased moisture needs, this works well to help hydrate and lock in the moisture of other products for a longer period of time.  My favorite use for this is as a lip treatment -- squeeze a drop from the dropper onto your finger or palm and then gently smooth this over your lips.  I use a very emolient gloss at night over the argan oil on my lips and I have noticed a difference (smoother lips in the morning and overall) just with the addition of the argan oil prior to application.<br /><br />I don't think argan oil is the miracle cure or anything, but this is a great staple for nourishing your skin, hair, and nails on a regular basis and it's simple, natural, and highly versatile.  The price, quality, and service were great with my order, so if you're thinking of trying an argan oil, I recommend this one.  Thanks, Amazon!
B001459IEE|2|I buy it for a friend that need it.
B003Y2ZC0E|5|Good selection of needles at a great price! Sealed, sterile and labelled clearly by size, Also perfect as a top up pack if you only use a few certain sizes.
B00FVRCQ0Y|3|So, I just received this today and tried it immediately. I will say I'm positive the scent is stronger than my own odor- yay! Unfortunately, the scent I got (thyme and lemongrass) makes me smell like a skunk... or stinkweed. Either way, it's not good. So I will be trying a different scent!
B0058AGBYG|4|I have very sensitive 40+ skin; especially sensitive when using depilatory facial hair removal products. However, this product did a remarkable job for me. Works exactly like it claims to. The protecting balm was a huge advantage, and made all the difference. It didn't damage my skin at all. The removing creme didn't have a strong smell, like most products of this type.<br /><br />Aside from the upfront cost of this product, my only real disappointment is that the regrowth appeared within 3 days. I left the removing creme on for 8 min, so maybe 10 next time? I felt that even though the cost seems somewhat high, there is enough product for a good 6-8 applications for me (upper lip only). This depends, of course, on how large an area you're using it. Overall, the best of this type of hair remover I've used yet.
B00553TD5U|4|Love the chair except the rubber liner for the bottom of it doesn't stay on and isn't long enough to go all the way around. Mostly color resistant and comfy.
B000FQ5NNI|5|Really like these kind of toothpicks; feels like a flossing. Nice way to be able to carry them with you.
B007U7TORG|5|Love it.
B0010DKTFW|5|I've used three different kinds of gel and this gel delivers the best results. Two 30 min treatments done more for me than a weeks worth of 38% carbamine peroxide. Highly recommended.
B000E8O8UQ|3|I bought this hair dryer for home use to replace my Ionic styler. However, this product is very heavy and difficult for me to handle. I will use it, but do not enjoy it fully. It is very clumsy and if you have difficulty with your arms, shoulder or hands it is not for you.
B008FOV6NI|3|Hair is full bundles,no thin ends!! hair came in like a number 2 color but super soft ... Kinda smelled funny but nothing that shampoo can't get rid of..really like the hair will purchase from seller again 😍
B001FWXJHI|4|Es un excelente perfume, ya yo antes lo habia utilizado, y solo estaba renovando mi existencis. No hubo problemas con el envio.
B0016PKA9O|5|And the only soap I've probably ever really liked. Soap has always just been soap to me. My wife started buying Lush soaps not long ago and I started trying them out. I bought this one myself with a few others but this was the best. It smells great, but isn't overpowering. It tingles a little, but not too much. And it actually makes my sking FEEL good for about a day even though I have no idea why.     I just bulk ordered a bunch since lush charges the same for shipping no matter how many you buy. I recommend buying more then one lush item at a time because of that.
B0039YQ8P0|5|Tastes great
B004LH0DMI|4|I bought this product to give a color boost to my un-colortreated hair.  It's medium brown with auburn highlights (naturally) and I wanted to boost the red without permanent hair color damage.  I shampoo every other day and have been using this product exclusively for a couple of weeks.  I can see a subtle difference. The color is deeper.  It's nice, but took repeated uses before I noticed much of a difference at all.  I wouldn't mind going a bit more red so may look for a different shade next time.  If your hair is a lighter color than mine is you may notice more drastic changes earlier.
B002HPFILC|3|While this hair powder does camouflage a little greying at the roots and helps fluff hair up a bit between shampoos, it is very messy.  It does smell nice, but it makes hair feel really dirty. You won't want to touch your hair, and if you do your fingers will be dark brown (in my case).  Used it the other day and by the end of the day it was all over my forehead.  Thankfully I have bangs so it was not noticeable.  It is also hard to apply, you need a small stiff brush to get it distributed by the roots.
B001ESIZOU|3|A bit smaller than I expected but my hair is thin so it will work for me.<br />Its very pretty on.
B00QDUX1UC|5|I was impressed by these false eyelashes. I am constantly wearing them and needed a bulk order.
B00ANRVY14|5|Both my daughter and I love the scent. It's very light, not strong. Perfect for right out of the shower, or if you want to freshen up in the evening.
B001MIZMP2|5|I really love this stuff ! I have never been dis satisfied with any Nivea product  ! lots of slippery lather ! feels great on your skin ! I'll definitely buy more !
B00KUJRHQ6|5|I love the scent of this soap! Keep it by my kitchen sink. Doesn't dry out my hands as others do.
B008722JI4|5|Literally he best bob cream I've ever used. So easy to apply and I get a lot of compliments on my skin. I can also sleep in it, if I have a late night and not wake up with break outs. Amazing! My new favorite skin care product
B007OT1QN0|1|These are thin which is great but also very flimsy. Broke after one use.
B003PGSHGA|5|Beautiful half wig. Blends in perfectly with my hair. I plan on buying more in different mixed colors very soon.
B000JIKY68|5|these really do look nice and don't show any ridges like other forms do. I have to keep an eye on them though because they did slip!
B00D0ANSAG|5|I usually buy makeup sponges like this at Marshall's or TJ Maxx, but lately I haven't been able to find them. So I decided to purchase these, and I am so glad I did. The sponges I've bought in stores are $5 per sponge; buying these on Amazon was more cost-effective because it was like getting one sponge free. Did I mention the superb customer service? I didn't? Well, let me tell you. When was the last time an Amazon seller sent you several emails to ensure that you received their product and were satisfied with your purchase? For me the answer is NEVER. That is true professionalism. I will continue to buy these from Beauty Junkees from now on!
B00GMRJWPY|5|I will reorder this again. Great product.  Family loves it.
B000HZ64TY|4|excellent product
B0086VI9TO|5|I prefer these smaller brush heads. The larger heads are OK, but once you try the compact heads the larger ones will feel unnecessarily bulky. The item I received is a genuine Philips product.
B00NN07IMW|4|Just as there is a price difference between this head and the OEM, there is a definite quality difference with the bristles.  I am okay with the stiffer bristles.  Where I have only been using the product for a few days, I cannot attest to the durability.
B0006GZC4W|1|I did not like this conditioner because it leaves residue and my dark brown/long hair always looks greasy. Smelled good though.
B00BDH0T2S|4|A little hard to use but good, long lasting result.
B00P7UJI7E|5|pastel neon pink s pretty and not hard to apply.
B0035B8AW6|5|I love the IC Fantasia product line. This works great for my fine 4b hair and my daughters thick 4a hair. Excellent curl definition, no flaking, residue or sticky feeling. The hold is softer that eco, but my wash and go's last as long as I want them to. Simply work through wet or damp hair and the results are perfect.
B004YD72VO|4|I cant attest to its durability I haven't had it long, But I can say it works well.  I suggest using darkness II mode, seems to get better line.  Now here is the only complaint I have about it, the instructions are backwards, literally. you will rip out your hair and scream if you try to operate it off of the instructions there just wrong.  Go to youtube and look up a vid called \\"thermal copier instruction\\" that was how I figured it. other than that I seems to work fine.
B00A7QSDLK|5|Its been a month of use and so far i like the product. I was losing hair like never before and had great recommendation re nourkrin, thats why i bought the product. I can definetely say that my hair has grown i can see the babe hair but maybe its too early to actually see how the fall diminish.
B006QPWXCG|5|I am writing this as a tentative review.  Here's my story:  after receiving this item and trying it out, I was quite disappointed in that it was so thin and watery and did not seem to be of good quality.  After posting a review stating this, I was immediately contacted by Melissa, who represented the manufacturer.  Melissa expressed her concern over my disappointment and was offering to do everything in her power to make it right.  She also explained that the thin, watery consistency was most likely caused by the product having been frozen in transit.  At this point, I cannot say one way or the other how good the product is, but I CAN state that it is rare to have a company care about their quality and customer satisfaction like this, and even more rare for them to go out of their way to make it right.  I applaud this company, and am awaiting a replacement bottle to try again.  At that time I will update this review.
B00KHH08GC|1|Rollers fall apart once you remove them to refill
B00H7CK6IK|5|Perfect!  I loved this product and would buy again.  Melted well, blended with colors and scents, resolidified in my molds perfectly.  Will definitely order again.
B000052WYN|4|I've been using this for about 5 years now. Over all I do like it but in the last few years something has changed either with my skin or the product and it is flaking on the inside portion of my eye by the time it dries. It is however waterproof and sweat proof and has a deep color. I live in AZ and we have very HOT summers, it holds no problem and no smudging. Best use is in the first week but starts to thicken up after that, it is still usable for the duration of the bottle but not as smooth as went first opened. I'm still looking for the perfect eyeliner though. Brush is great for control and easily can switch from thin to thick lines with a little practice. Multiple coats will give it a thicker look but if you are a seasoned liquid eyeliner user you shouldn't have to much trouble with it.
B003ZS8MDQ|1|I will give no stars for missing 3 packs.  It clearly says Pack of 4 but I only received 1.<br />I don't have time to return this to UPS...Please send me the rest!
B004FLWE54|1|Buyer beware
B00YSZCSLC|3|Just started taking this with 8 other vitamin supplements. I'm afraid over-enthusiastic reviews sound false to me. I can't imagine taking vitamins for a couple weeks show &#34;amazing results&#34; on hair. I'm 3 months post-chemo and hoping this product will help my hair grow in thicker and healthier. Right now it's growing out like fluffy cotton instead of the healthy hair I'm used to. I've never smelled vitamins like this. Smells like post-asparagus urine (if you know what I mean). I'll be patient and add to this if I see results, but it won't be in 2 weeks.
B0015GCC0E|5|I can't say enough good things about it. I've copied and pasted this review into a couple places. I love it that much.<br /><br />The cleanser is soy based and it comes in a container that has a scooped top. You place your beauty blender egg shaped sponge in the scoop and press once or twice while the bottle of cleanser remains sitting on the counter,(no need to turn the bottle over to get the cleansing liquid out)this revelutionary design insures that you only use a small ammount of the cleanser. The soy based cleanser actually breaks down all kinds of different foundations that you may have used with the sponge. I've been known to use the soy based liquid cleanser to clean my brushes as well. Instead of setting the egg in the scoop, I set a circular cleansing pad in the scoop, press once and then use the pad to clean my brushes. I usually let them dry overnight before using them again.<br /><br />Now onto the sponge.... It leaves foundation looking flawless. You use the sponge with a technique called, dribbling. Apply a small ammount of foundation (it's all you'll need) and then dribble the sponge all over your entire face using a bouncing motion, yet very close to the face. The side of the egg that comes to a rounded point is for areas such as the corners of the nose. While applying your foundation to the corners of the nose with the tip of the sponge- continue using the dribbling technique. I like that you clean the sponge right away after using it because it gets rid of the bacteria left on it from your face. It's a great way to reduce, re-use and recycle. You can use your sponge wet or dry. It swells up to twice its size when it is completely saturated with water. I usually barely wet mine before applying foundation.<br /><br />You can buy these products seperately, but I would advise buying them as a duo because it's less expensive when you buy them together. I had to buy mine seperately because I was in a hurry to get them after a friend told me all about how great they are. It's the same price on here as it was about a year ago on CherryCulture dot com. I love Amazon, but the shipping can get ridiculous sometimes. You can buy $40 worth of products on CherryCulture and then get free shipping. The only trouble is that they usually sell out of this product fairly fast. So your best bet might just be to buy from here. Especially if they are offering Super Saver Shipping.<br /><br />I love my Beauty Blender.the same price on here as it was about a year ago on CherryCulture dot com.

B00604MTQI|4|I add up the abilities and the scent of this Suave lotion, factor in the price and I am hooked. I have dry skin, the weather is drying year round where I live, and I use about a bottle of body lotion per week. This one from Suave is a favorite of mine. Its a quality lotion, with a quality scent, at an unbeatable price.
B002VECJSY|4|More red than brown, but it's very nice. It has a very shimmery finish, and you only need to apply a little. Long-lasting and not too heavy.
B00T9UH3IO|5|Great experience super fast shipping. The product was exactly as I expected. A+++
B004TGGNV6|1|First off, rubbing this in my hair makes my hair white. I have black hair. African american male so you can get a picture. This stuff smells ok. But the oil version of this smells really good but still isn't great as a moisturizer. It's not even good as a moisturizer. Ok back to this product. It makes my hair extremely dry, crunchy, and makes my scalp flake. Not something you'd expect from a moisturizer. Oh, it gets better. The main ingredient in this is &#34;thin mineral oil&#34;. Not what I was expecting. It's the second ingredient. I think the first was water or something. I tossed it so I don't remember. The other things like shea, keratin, and silk proteins are pretty much non-existent in this product. I didn't like it at all. I'm sad because I was hoping that those non-existent ingredients would have been the main ingredients and in ample amounts. Try it if you like.
B00JD7ODUY|5|Absolutely love this makeup brush set.  First they are made of high quality synthetic materials.  Having sensitive skin and allergies I did not have to worry about any adverse reactions to my skin or sneezing while applying my makeup.  There is a wide variety of brushes, that some I'm not even familiar with.  Included is Foundation brush, powder, blending, brow, angled and lip brushes plus 7 more.  They all have light wooden handles to make them easy to hold.  The bristles after using them have all stayed in tack, no loose ones laying around the table.  The roll up pouch is a nice lightweight but sturdy bag with a purple soft sheen.  Each brush has it's own pocket to stay in place.  When you roll up the bag the bristles do not bend or roll up.  Excellent brush set for the money !!
B002ZF12EG|5|I must admit, I have had my share of trying on hair products, and when it comes to conditioners, I am never fully pleased.  As a general rule, my thin hair usually goes limp after applying detangler, and conditioning balms make it look as if I had not washed it at all, leaving it greasy to the touch and the eye.  That is, until I discovered Klorane's Softening and Detangling Conditioning Balm with Oat Milk.  The bottle claims the product is prepared in several stages, \\"starting with an aqueous concentration of the whole grain followed by a process of concentration.\\"  This last step obviously makes all the difference, as upon application after shampooing one can immediately feel how each and every hair is coated with a thin, protective layer.  Hence, the hair gains in volume and it does not tangle as it is protected in its own cocoon.  You will notice this effect from the very first application.<br /><br />This is also a great product to give hair a nourishing treatment once a month or every other week, depending on the condition of your goldilocks.  After shampooing, apply generously and wrap a warm towel over your head.  Leave on for 20 minutes then rinse.  Your hair will look luxuriously shiny and manageable.<br /><br />Klorane's Softening and detangling conditioning balm with oat milk: definitely a keeper.
B009VGNYFM|5|I switched to this soap right after it came out and now it's the only one I will ever use.
