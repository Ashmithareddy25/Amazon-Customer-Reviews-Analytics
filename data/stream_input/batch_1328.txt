B004R2DS9C|4.0|Great product for rounding up Legos. We only have a few sets now (around 800 pieces), and it is perfect. As we get more Lego sets, this will probably be used for whatever project we are working on.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|Over the last few months people have been raving about the movie Courageous, and I am one of them! This movie is changing families, marriages, men and women around the world. What \\"Fireproof\\" did for marriages, Courageous is doing for men!<br /><br /> I cannot say enough good about it! There is plenty of action, comedy (the Snake Kings scene was priceless) and a little something for everyone. Although a family movie, because of scenes involving gang violence and drugs, I would recommend that younger children do not watch but that said, it is a movie that will definitely spur on some amazing family discussions to be sure. I often find that Christian movies tend to come off as cheesy and forced, but this was not one of those. Christian film making has come a long way! The story lines in the movie were great and everyone can relate with the many different characters. It was refreshing to see that despite differences in life experiences the men in this movie came together for the good of their families and did what needed to be done. This movie will definitely make fathers evaluate their lives and make some important changes! A perfect tool for churches, men's ministrys and marriage ministries for sure.<br /><br />On January 17, 2012 the movie was released on DVD, with a Collector's Edition that includes over two hours of extras! I have had a blast viewing these, and its been great to learn how the movie came to be, laugh until I cried at the outtakes and bloopers and learn how to pray more effectively for the men in my life. You can purchase the movie at your favorite Christian bookseller in your area.

0307352145|4.0|Shy. Weak. Unmotivated.<br /><br />These are some of the words that might come to mind when the average person thinks about introverts. Most of us think of them as immersed in their own worlds, unable to cope with social situations, and less likely to contribute ideas and innovation compared to their extroverted counterparts.<br /><br />Susan Cain's \\"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\\" seeks to explode these myths about introverts by examining the overlooked gifts that they bring to the office, the classroom, and society at large while understanding the underlying science behind introversion.<br /><br />The book is composed of four parts. In the first, Cain begins, not with neuroscience or psychology, but culture. Specifically, she explores how modern western society came to embrace the \\"extrovert ideal.\\" This ideal embraces the outspoken, the fearless, and the gregarious over and above the quiet, the timid, and the intimate. Yet, as studies have shown, it is the gifts of introverts that actually lead to greater creativity and productivity in the workplace.<br /><br />In the second part Cain explores the biology of introversion, highlighting research demonstrating that introverts actually process sensory input differently from extroverts. She also talks with experts researching the interaction between a person's genetic makeup and environmental factors that may influence their temperament.<br /><br />The third part explores extroversion and introversion in other cultures, while the fourth gives concrete strategies for introverts and extroverts for dealing with the differences between the two. This includes chapters on how parents and educators can help introverted children discover and nurture their particular gifts.<br /><br />Cain includes an impressive amount of interviews and anecdotes which serve to illustrate the research and studies she discusses. Cain talks with Harvard business students, an evangelical pastor, children, a beloved psychology professor, and others. These help to flesh out some of the drier academic content and put real human faces to the struggles introverts overcome.<br /><br />If you have an introvert in your life you want to understand better -- or if you are an introvert and want some strategies for living in an extrovert's world -- \\"Quiet\\" is the book for you.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I recieved a free advance reader's copy of this book from LibraryThing's Early Reviewer program.t some of the drier academic content and put real human faces to the struggles introverts overcome.

B000H6SXMY|1.0|Ok, let me start off by saying I think Friends is one of the greatest shows ever made.  I was to young to watch it when it was on TV.  But after seeing reruns, I had to have the series set.  My mom got it for me this Christmas and I was super excited.  I decided to open it a few days ago, to see if any of the DVDs were scratched.  Well, I did not even get to open it, I noticed that the left past of the lid was ripped all the way up.  As a collector, I couldn't let this be.  So, Amazon told my mom to send it back and they would send her another one.  I got my other set yesterday.  I opened it today and I was so upset.  Most of the DVDs have marks all over then.  Be it a little mark, or a cluster of marks.  My mom told me to watch them all and see if they worked.  I informed her that there are over 200 episodes.  So, Amazon gave her a partial refund.  I don't think it was really enough.  I mean, I have no clue how many of these DVDs will even play.  I was reading online and it seems the UK version is better.  So NOW I have to either get a or set my DVD player to multi region and get the 15th anniversary edition from the UK amazon.  It is a shame.  Such a great show left stained by the fault of bad packaging.  If you want to get this, I would say be ready to have some DVDs that have marks.  I am not saying they will not play, but to me, not knowing is almost as bad as them not working.<br /><br />Oh, and I am almost sure the pictures of them on the front is a big sticker that you could pull off if you tried hard enough.  If they put this series out on blu ray, let us hope they do a better job!!!!

B005MYEQ4U|2.0|I decided to purchase Midnight in Paris because of a recommendation from a friend.  Perhaps my expectations going into it were too high but I found the movie to be very dry.  I think the movie had potential but just couldn't get there.
098478280X|5.0|My friend had the 4th edition of the book but I wasn't looking for a job at the time. I started looking for a job 3 months after this book came out. I bought the 5th edition and used it extensively, reading almost all the chapters and spending time on the questions before checking the solutions. I also paid great attention to the first 7 chapters as I had only one interview experience from 2004 and that wasn't even very technical, unlike what you get from the tech giants. I spent about 2 months for preparation, using this book and CareerCup.  TL;DR: I received an offer from Amazon last week and another offer from Google today. Thanks Gayle!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I don't think that ALW intended for LND to be directly compared to Phantom. Phantom and LND are both different, but both VERY amazing/awesome/phantastic. even if the story is different from what some people think should happen, it's still a masterpiece and deserves to be recognized for its own music and story and actors, not for its prequel. the music is amazing. the cast is amazing in both productions. it's worth buying. keep an open mind and you'll be amazed.
0006748287|4.0|Here are reviews from three very different people (mine, and then my two kids)...<br />This book is definitely worth the read, and NEVER should be banned from any library (as it has been and some think it should be).  Every library should have several copies.  I don't think it should be required reading for children under the age of 12, however I don't think it would really hurt them, they just won't get as much out of it as they will when they are older.  My kids didn't like the ending, but I thought it was a good dending, especially if there will be sequels (which we learned there are).<br /><br />I want to quote portions of the two top reviews because they made some very good points and I agree whole-heartedly with them:<br /><br />\\"Good literature makes readers think. Banning this book takes away the freedom of speech, the freedom to read, and the freedom to learn and explore. The banning of The Giver is ironically similar to the actions of the Community that lead the Community to its suppressive and stifling state. A powerful story, The Giver keeps readers in suspense, touches them, and stays with them for a long time...\\"<br /><br />\\"Although there are aspects of this Community that we may find unsettling, we must remember that Lowry is not advocating this system. She is, in fact, inviting us to consider whether our own society has any of the characteristics of the Community that disturb us:<br />Do we attempt to make our lives pain free?<br />Do we attempt to erase unpleasant memories?<br />Do we use euphemisms?<br />Do we use robotic phrases, as for apologies?<br />Do we have anything resembling the \\"House of the Old\\"?<br />Do we have a ritual that might be called a \\"Ceremony of Loss\\"?<br />Do we attempt Climate Control?<br />Do we avoid talking about ways in which we differ from each other?<br />In our own Society, without a designated Receiver of Memory, that responsibility -- with its inherent pain and exhilaration -- falls to each of us. Vital questions for us to consider are Which memories will we receive? Which will we give?\\"<br /><br />P.S. I had the privilege of listening to the audio book by Listening Library (unabridged, read by Ron Rifkin), rather than reading it myself.  The reader did an excellent job and it was probably more enjoyable and better understood than just reading the book for myself.<br /><br />I aked my kids to write (or give) a review of their own, and since they do not have their own Amazon account, I will just add them here:<br /><br />Here is what my son says about the book (he is 11, in 6th grade):<br />\\"I enjoyed the book, it was entertaining, but it was very confusing at first.  The end was very stupid to me, and I do not recommend reading this book if you don't like to read a whole book and then the end ruins it.\\"<br /><br />Here is my daughter's review (she is in 8th grade):<br />\\"I'm 13, and I liked this book very much.  At first it was a bit confusing because the world in the story isn't like it is today, but soon I realized what was going on, and I really enjoyed it.  I didn't quite like the ending because the book didn't feel finished, but since there are sequels I guess it's ok.  I liked the over-all story line; there was a lot of mystery and suspense, and it was very fascinating because it is so different from the world we live in today.  It was very weird, but it made the story that much more interesting.<br /><br />The world the main character, Jonas, lives in is a \\"perfect\\" world; a world without conflict, poverty, unemployment, or divorce.  Children never disobey, and everyone gets along.  But as the story goes along, Jonas realizes that his world isn't so perfect after all, when he realizes what the real world is like.  His world doesn't have snow, it doesn't have hills, it doesn't have the ocean, and it doesn`t have birds.  You don't get to pick your own spouse, and you are only allowed two children, one male, one female.  Everyone except Jonas thinks it's perfect. Jonas wants to change things back to the way the real world was, but that's a lot harder than he thought.\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think that Suzanne Collins did a great job instilling suspense in the reader when reading The Hunger Games. The book theme is a little daunting and gruesome to think about but I really connected with the characters and the storyline. I am really excited to read the other two books in the trilogy before the movie comes out. I loved this book. It was literally glued to my hand. I just couldn't put it down.  Going to start reading the book Catching Fire: [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]]
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app.  I use it when I'm on the bus, heading in to work. I just. plug in my headphones and listen. to any passage on the Bible!!  Excellent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great Read.  The story was futuristic yet very realistic.  As I was reading this book, I pictured something of a cross between Mad Max and The Gladiator.  This book will draw out emotions of disgust, rebellion, sadness, hope, love and many others.
0061801313|5.0|Purchased this set for my granddaughter for Christmas. She loved them. I will order set #2 today. Came in a great box just as promised. Makes a great gift!
0439023491|4.0|I loved the first installment of the Hunger Games..it was a fresh take on the Romanesque societal model.  The powerful live in their gilded utopia the rest of the people try to scrape by a living while being held in a state of fear to keep from uprising...it was particularly disturbing and brutal in that children were used in games of death, nationally broadcast, for the entertainment of the rich and to instill fear in the 'great unwashed' out in the districts.<br /><br />I liked this book as well, but not enough to give it a five.  Why?  It's the second book in a trilogy, that's why.  Which isn't a bad thing but more often than not the first book comes in like a lion and the second book is setting up the pieces for an epic conclusion.<br /><br />This book picks up where the Hunger Games left off.  Katmiss and Peeta have won.  For the first time in the game's history two victors were chosen so to them go the spoils.  Their families needn't worry about starvation anymore, they're set for life.  New homes, more food and comforts and money than they could possibly use in their lifetimes.  As it happen the victor goes on the annual victory tour of the districts.<br /><br />Everything should be glorious, no?  Katniss can go back to her family and her friend (??) Gale.  However, her plans of being single for her natural life and never having to marry are quickly thrown out the window when Haymitch gets wind that the Capitol is not happy.  You see, the President wasn't happy with their little suicide drama at the end of the first book.  He sees that as an act of defiance.  He suspects that the romance angle that got both of them out alive was a ruse.  The solution?  They're going to have to keep the romance as real as possible...indefinitely.<br /><br />As they go on the tour Katniss's actions from the first game start to come to a head as there are rumors of rebellion.  The capitol simply can't have this.  What better way to belay a rebellion than to cut off the head of the rebellion?  No, a happy ending isn't in sight for Katniss and the ones she cares about.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SLIGHT SPOILERS<br /><br />I think one of the things that make me not rate this one quite as highly was the retread of the Hunger Games formula.  The victors are thrust into yet another games.  Which isn't a bad thing, it just seemed to lack the impact of the first book because of how new it was..how new it was to the characters...<br /><br />another thing is the Katniss/Peeta/Gale dynamic.  Usually a love triangle can be pretty good reading and frankly I rather enjoy Katniss's indecision about her feelings towards Peeta...not because I like to see characters get tortured but because A) I always pull for the underdog (usually to be disappointed..heh) and B) it makes her seem more real.  My issue with this is Gale.  We hardly know Gale.  Gale hasn't gotten much face time in either book.  We are told to accept the fact through Katniss's exposition that she has feelings for Gale..which is fine..but it's hard to connect to a character that's so important to the main protagonist when we've hardly gotten a chance to read them.  I accept that he's important to Katniss, but he's not very important to me because there is no sense of knowing him or being attached to the character.<br /><br />I will say that this is an emotionally driven book which I also liked.  The whole Katniss falling for Peeta and Peeta already being there strikes a chord and gets you invested in these characters.  Very good job by the author to make us care.<br /><br />In  the end (which set up the pins for the final act a bit too curtly and abruptly for my liking) this is setting the stage for what will be the final act of the saga.  I'm looking forward to reading it.<br /><br />Don't let my negative comments sway you (if you're even reading this!) away from the book.  It's still a VERY good book.  It's just that the Hunger Games were so good it's hard to avoid 'middle-book-itis' =)he rebellion?

0312641893|1.0|Cinder, is a debut book by Marissa Meyer, its a re telling of the story Cinderella. However, it's not the traditional riding in the sunset and living happily ever after kind of book! I have to be honest; this book was painful to read! I have no Idea, why anyone would call this brilliant! I can't even give points to this writing for originality because it seemed to me that I was not only frustrated by the re telling, but watching the movie \\"Princess Diaries\\", (the part were Mia was trying to escape in her old beat up car... and it started raining.... The only difference is, Cinder wasn't singing the \\"stars\\" song and Cinder was racing to the palace and not away from it! How. Charming!)  The book was badly plotted, the outline was a joke and very much predictable! It was sadly disappointing... Worst, I couldn't even judge the book based on originality!  Because it is not! The only part that was original is the fact that Cinder is a \\"Cyborg\\" and some funny little comments oh! Stars! \\"Iko\\", the outdated Android! ... Hence my rating is 1 star!!!!
1451648537|5.0|I got this book for Christmas from my wife, as I'm a software engineer and we recently moved in to USA, I was eager to read about one of the most world-known computer visionary and his road through life.  I haven't finished the book yet, I've read about one third so far, but book is very interesting so far, especially in depicting Steve's personality. It's very inspiring in many ways as well, broadening one's view of start-up companies in seventies and eighties and revealing some unknown aspects (at least to me) that stood behind many computer products (not only Apple ones, other software companies, like HP, Microsoft and IBM, and their founders are deeply connected with Steve jobs).  I would recommend to anyone who thinks about how to be successful in life and what he/she should be able to sacrifice and what not. If you like technology and it's history than this is a must.

B006FS22Y8|5.0|It saddens me when I see people around my age succumb to drugs or alcohol when they have immense talent. Amy was different over the rest of \\"glamourous\\" wannabe singers out there. Her music was heartfelt and hauntingly real. You can feel everything she said, no matter if you went through it or didnt. This CD proves that we will be missing a amazing singer with spunk and a great ear for music. Looks like Adele will be passing that torch.  Top 5 Favorites  5. Like Smoke  4. Tears Dry  3.

Click on any of them and you'll find \\"wooden\\" puzzles with either several (maybe 7) pieces per animal or several whole animals that you have to fit into the whole animal shape. Each puzzle is remarkably well done and looks about as high res as I've seen in an app. This is not a cheaply made game!<br /><br />My 2 year old son is eating this game up. Like other well made games for children, like [[ASIN:B004DPC5Y2 Monkey Preschool Lunchbox]], my boy will play this all day if I let him.<br /><br />If you are looking for a high quality game for your child to play then check this one out.

0385474547|4.0|Read it a couple of times 20+ years ago. I can't remember what I thought of it then, but reading it this time just made me sad. Even if I hadn't read it before, it was just so clear the tragedy that was to unfold. So much has been written about this book, I'll just leave it that.
140053271X|1.0|I purchased a Nook in Chicago in 10/2011. I explained to the salesperson that I lived outside of the US and needed assurance that the device would work outside the US. I was assured that there was no problem. I paid for the Nook with my non-US credit card. I returned to Guatemala the next day. I excitedly booted up my Nook only to find out that it would not work with a non-US credit card. I immediately contact the Nook on-line support. They told me that I would have to return the Nook within 15 days to get a refund. I explained that was impossible as I was in Guatemala.  I asked if B&N would pick up the shipping charges as my only option would be FedEx (very costly)  Of course, they said no although it was their mistake. Amazon would have picked up the charges.  Finally, after begging for over an hour, B&N agreed to allow me to return the Nook later than the 15 days. A friend was returning to the States in Nov and generously agreed to send the Nook back.  I was told I would get a refund in 2=3 weeks. I didn't receive it. I e-mailed B&N three times. No response. Finally, I had an online chat with the support center and learned that my credit card was credited on Jan 9.  No one had written me to let me know this had happened. When I asked the very helpful customer rep why no one had returned my e-mail, she said it was a different department that handles e-mails.  Just awful. DON'T BUY A NOOK IF YOU NEED CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!s
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|The Oscar for \\"Best Movie Shot in Venice\\" goes to...THE TOURIST. The beautiful city of Venice, Italy was the best thing about this movie. The rest was...well...not really anything International Bad Guy vs Interpol different or edge-of-the-seat-whodunit startling. It was an OK 113 minute long piece of escapism. While the movie was entertaining, I didn't really care about the characters. Angelina Jolie standing there looking glamorous does nothing for me, and Johnny Depp, a gifted actor with long, unwashed hair, was wasted here. The real star was Venice. There were many beautiful views of this \\"Floating City\\" to marvel at. For that alone I rate it 3 and 1/2 stars.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It was hard but fun. There where too much mini games. All the games should easy too unlock.The rest of the game was fine.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|I already owned the DVD's for most of the movies and wanted a little better picture quality. I think they delivered on this with improvements throughout the series although the later films are much better than the first two. My problem is the sound in disc 7, Deathly Hallows pt. 1, keeps going out of sync with the picture. I can pause rewind forward and then play to get it back on track but it happens repeatedly making the experience very poor.
0060873027|3.0|What's good about it:  1) Certain elements of Michael Crichton are preserved in the novel, including the usage of cutting-edge technology, some cool ideas introduced that general public may not be aware of, funny sex scenes, action-packed...  What's bad about it:  1) The technology isn't well-described. It's not even believable. Previous Crichton books, such as Timeline, have made a brilliant attempt to make the technology sounds real, as if it really is happening. But this book totally fails in that regard. It reads like a pure science fiction, and the feeble attempts to make it sound like as if it's real, I seriously just laugh at those moments.  2) Many scenes of \\"Honey I shrunk the kids\\" come into mind...if you like that movie, then perhaps it's a good thing, but i didn't. Felt childish at certain points.  3) Characters are flat, predictable, and dialogues are stilted.  So...should you read it?  Go ahead if you are a big MC fan. But bear in mind, it's not a master piece.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This was such a fun, challenging game! I enjoyed the mini games thoroughly!! I'm on game 10 or so and continue to add points so I can add more games!!

(along with Jennifer Morrison, who was really good, too - something about House MD actors, I guess)

B003OPUZYY|4.0|Released 26 July 2010 as a 48-track 3CD set in the UK (3 Aug 2010 in the USA) - \\"Think About The Times: The Chrysalis Years 1969 to 1972\\" on Chrysalis/EMI 5099964214726 takes its title from a track on the 1970 TEN YEARS AFTER album \\"Watt\\" - and breaks down as follows...<br /><br />Disc 1 (76:53 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 8 are the album \\"Ssssh\\" - released August 1969 in the UK on Deram SML 1052 and in the USA on Deram/London DES 18029<br />Track 9 is \\"If You Should Love Me\\" - the non-album 7\\" single B-side to the 'American' release of \\"Love Like A Man\\" issued in 1970 on Deram DEM 7529<br />Tracks 10 to 17 are the album \\"Cricklewood Green\\" - released April 1970 in the UK on Deram SML 1065 and in the USA on Deram DES 18038<br /><br />Disc 2 (79:17 minutes):<br />Track 1 is \\"Love Like A Man (Single Edit)\\" - a non-album version [A-side] issued May 1970 in the UK on Deram DM 299<br />Tracks 2 to 9 are the album \\"Watt\\" - released December 1970 in the UK on Deram SML 1078 and Deram XDES 18050<br />Tracks 10 to 19 are the album \\"A Space In Time\\" - released August 1971 in the UK on Chrysalis CHR 1001 and in the USA on Columbia KC 30801<br /><br />Disc 3 (60:16 minutes):<br />Track 1 is \\"I'd Love To Change The World (Single Edit)\\" - a non-album 7\\" single version [A-side] issued September 1971 in the USA on Columbia 4-45457<br />Tracks 2 to 10 are the album \\"Rock & Roll Music To The World\\" - released October 1972 in the UK on Chrysalis CHR 1009 and in the USA on Columbia KC 31779<br />Track 11 is \\"Choo Choo Mama (Single Edit)\\" - a non-album 7\\" single version [A-side] issued November 1972 in the USA on Columbia 4-45736<br />Track 12 is \\"Love Like A Man (Recorded Live At Bill Graham's Fillmore East)\\" - a non-album 7\\" single version [B-side to \\"Love Like A Man\\"] issued May 1970 in the UK on Deram DM 299<br /><br />Housed in a double jewel-case with a fairly skimpy (but informative) 8-page booklet - EMI have released many multiple CD sets in this 'retro' series with the same generic packaging - Robin Trower, Frankie Miller, Barclay James Harvest, The Groundhogs, UFO and The Edgar Broughton Band among them. All are remastered and pitched at mid-price.<br /><br />In this case (as is with most of the others) - the superb remastered sound comes courtesy of PETER MEW at Abbey Road. It should also be noted that \\"Ssssh\\", \\"Cricklewood Green\\" and \\"Watt\\" are different remasters to the 2002 versions done by PASCHAL BYRNE at Alchemy Audio in London. The other big draw here for TYA fans is the difficult to find and hugely popular albums \\"A Space In Time\\" and \\"Rock & Roll Music To The World\\" from 1971 and 1972 respectively - available remastered - and reasonably priced at last.<br /><br />Musically - as one reviewer rightly says - some tracks are plodding and none are 'live' and therefore not really representative of the band at their best. But dealing with what we do have - there is so much on here to savour. \\"Working On The Road\\", \\"I'm Coming On\\" and \\"Choo Choo Mama\\" are great boogie tunes. I also love the acoustic vibe of \\"Circles\\", the Prog Rock keyboards of \\"Standing At The Station\\" and the string arrangements of \\"Over The Hill\\". There are even wise deliberations on beliefs on the trippy treated vocals of \\"Religion\\" (lyrics above). It isn't all genius - of course not. But there are 5 studio albums & five rare 7\\" single sides on here - and that's an awful lot of Classic Rock music for not a huge amount of wonga.<br /><br />Niggles - packaging wise its workmanlike at best. I would have much preferred it if this entire series has gone down the road of Columbia's \\"Original Classic Albums\\" mini box sets - albums in repro card sleeves with the full session info available via download from Sony's website. But alas...<br /><br />Too often overlooked - TEN YEARS AFTER still hold huge swathes of fans in serious affection - and on re-hearing these remasters and Alvin Lee's terrific axework - it's easy to know why.<br /><br />Rock & Roll Music To Us...Recommended.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I wanted a very light weight cover for my new Kindle Fire. The Fire a heavier than my older 3G Kindle, and I didn't want extra weight from a cover. This Folio Cover is perfect!<br /><br />The Fire slipped in snugly and provides peace of mind for incidental wear and tear. The cover is a bit flimsy, but a worthy trade-off for the weight. The felt backing on the cover's inside keeps the Fire from slipping around. Finally, the elastic band to hold the cover either in the closed or open position feels durable. I'm cautious in my use of things, so I expect it to last a long time.<br /><br />5-Star product.
0143118706|5.0|The item was shipped when stated and the product was of fair quality.  Thank you for a good shopping experience!
B003Y58CKS|5.0|First, I would like to state that I generally like \\"Traditional\\" Productions.  Most new takes on a \\"Classic\\" don't always work for me.  Yet, every so often a piece is so well thought out by the director and cast that I can honestly say \\"My eyes have been opened.\\"  This is such a production.  In general it reminds me of the Pre-Nazi Germany of the musical CABARET.  It works for me.  However, what truly raises the \\"Ante\\" is an excellent singing and acting cast.  Things in the pit are also great.  The three leads all sing wonderfully and act naturally.  They really dig into their characters.  I also found the Sparafucile another new great bass voice with a sonorous low F.  He also acts credibly. The sets especially in Act III work well.  Damrau, Florez and Lucic are the best we have today for these roles; and are great even when compared to anyone's  ideal of a long past GOLDEN ERA!  A dream Quartet for any era.  Sure it's Modern and creative but it works and works very well with both the music and the libretto.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|My wife came across a trailer about the movie \\"Courageous\\" and suggested that it might be a good movie to watch. I asked a few people if they had seen it and those who had recommended it. I decided to buy it because I thought it might be a good movie to share with other fathers. Honestly, I wasn't expecting a great movie, at least production and acting wise. Many Christian films have great messages, but have sometimes laughably bad scripts and even worse acting. This movie didn't \\"feel\\" like a Christian movie in that it was pretty raw and involved some pretty scary characters (i.e. gangbangers). How they managed to present these sordid characters realistically without as much as one curse word is itself, amazing!  The acting was very good, especially the lead character Adam who was a \\"good father\\" by most people's standards yet was shown just how far below God's expectations he was. The new officer who transferred from another force was also very good and convincing. I loved how the movie wasn't necessarily just a \\"feel good\\" Christian movie. There were individual and family struggles and one tragic event that started Adam's journey. I also loved Javier's story... this is a man who love for his family was only eclipsed by his love for God. Even with that, he questioned why God was not helping him. In his cry to God, his prayers are answered immediately and in a very clever way.  This movie was similar to \\"Fireproof\\" with Kirk Cameron, only focused more on fatherhood than marriage. I recommend every father, not just Christian, see this movie!
B003GSLX5Y|1.0|I'm a huge fan of Strunk and White's \\"Elements of Style,\\" however, this is not the Strunk and White edition. This is simply a digitized-for-Kindle version of the original (Strunk only) edition.<br /><br />There's a reason that college classes across the country use the Strunk and White edition--it is simply better.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|Nice long cable, I like the braided better than standard cable, great deal, don't get ripped off at big box store.
B005HW21Y4|5.0|As a native Irish speaker I thought long and hard before purchasing this book. Misspelled Irish words really irritate me so. They were none is this book, to my knowledge anyhow, I speak the language but am not a scholar. Excellently researched. Many thanks to the author. A fun fast paced but not overly confusing book to read.

B000MD9UJC|5.0|The Nit Ize upgrade kit is a wonderful battery saving modification and so easy to use. I can easily recommend it.
B004856SQ8|4.0|Sure the movie is a re-make of a classic T.V. show but let's be honest here, the vast majority of the people watching this probably did not even know that unless someone told them.  The action is great! The acting is well done and one can't complain when they get to see Jessica biel on screen for any length of time.  Despite its cheese factor if you are in to action flicks this one delivers!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this app is the best. it is so adicting and fun. its doesn't have all the modes that it does on the iphone but its still great. you shoulg get this app!
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Jason Mraz is a master wordsmith. Yes that sounds an awful lot like a WoW term but follow along....  His music is heartfelt and fun with lyrics that actually mean something. In the world of music these days it is rare to find a man and his buddy who work together to bring about some of the funnest songs of the year. I can say with 100% certainty that his live shows are better than his recorded stuff which makes him all the more great in my opinion.  Jason Mraz is special, I am glad he chooses to share his mind with us
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This book is long and i read it in five sittings. Once i picked it up, it was so hard to put down. It is written so beautifully, you feel connected to each character and understand their voices. I really recommend reading this book.

144234430X|5.0|Although Stephen King's latest is heavy (at 844 pages) to even pick up, it's a real page-turner and holds one's interest to the end. And why not, when it concerns an event, the assassination of JFK, which changed our country and out lives forever. Jake Epping,is a 33-year-old English teacher in the little town of Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money helping folks get their GED's. The essays his students turn in are usually pretty boring and rather tame stuff, but one essay by a crippled 55-year-old really blows his mind. The man tells of the night his drunken father murdered his mother, his sister and his brother with a sledgehammer. Soon after that Jake's older friend Al, who owns the local diner, lets him in on a secret. There's a storeroom in his diner, Al says, that's a doorway to the past, to one particular day in 1958 to be specific. He begs Jake to help him with a quest that has become an obsession with him--namely to prevent the assassinationn of President Kennedy. Jake isn't too hot on the idea and has his doubts about time-travel, but he lets Al talk him into it and soon begins his double life. He steps through the door and emerges as George Amberson in the 1958 world of Elvis and Ike, big, gas-guzzling cars and bobby-socks. Traveling to the dreary little town of Derry, Maine, he takes care of the would-be sledgehammer murderer to save the man's family. And from there he goes to the pleasant town of Jodie, Texas, where he falls passionately in love with a school librarian, the victim of a strange and unhappy marriage. But always his path points dangerously to Dallas and the sick mind of Lee Harvey Oswald, who is plotting to kill the President. Can Jake, in his time-travel bubble, stop him? His efforts are electrifing and unbelievably frightening.

B00364K6YW|5.0|I saw this many years ago when first broadcast on television by the BBC.  I had no idea who Colin Firth was nor did I recognize any other performers in the production but I never forgot the amazing acting by Mr. Firth and Miss Ehle.  Mr. Firth conveyed so very much with very little speach initially but definitely said more than he ever could have with words.  I was delighted to find the DVD while on Amazon and enjoy watching this fine and beautiful production more than I can express.

B0042J6VUS|1.0|I think this was the sorriest piece of crap I ever purchased through Amazon. Flimsy plastic that practically broke in my hands as I used it. Both the tripod and the plastic phone bracket were completely useless. Toy quality stuff, just stay away from it.

B000FCKC4C|2.0|Some literary works originally written in languages other than English undergo an almost seamless transition when translated; using flowing prose that is idiomatic and effortless - conjuring all the imagery, atmosphere, and feeling of the original script. Unfortunately \\"The Alchemist\\" is not such a book. One gets the feeling that someone sat down with the original text, and, armed with nothing but a Portugese to English dictionary, banged off the English version, which was what I read. Throughout the book I could not shake the image of a non-English speaker, gesturing wildly while shouting to me \\"Pursue your dream Gerard!! If you don't it will haunt you!! And it will be HARD WORK!!\\"  Which is pretty much the gist of it. This overly simplistic and facile message is repeatedly hammered out with all the subtelty of a brick from the first few pages on. Perhaps in the original Portugese it was elevated by the beauty of the prose. I'll have to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I do suspect that some of this book's wider popularity lies with those who would seek to find personal justification for pursuing their own goals relentlessly, regardless of the wider consequences. Either that, or believing on some level that reading a copy of \\"Alchemist\\" will add to one's perceived intellectual credibility - in the same way that slightly sad people think that reading Nietzsche will. But if the book had some sort of hidden depths,they were too well hidden for me.
B001FB55MG|5.0|This by far the weirdest movie that Adam Sandler has ever made.  It is heartwarming, sad, happy and pure fun.  I have watch it at least five times.  It's one of those movies you can watch over and over.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Great movie my son liked it better then the previous one. More action. I think he has viewed at least 10 times if not more.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|When I was trying to think of a clever title for this review, \\"SciFi Ship Crashes Into Western (and Ruins It)\\" came to mind as did \\"High Noon Meets Independence Day (and They Don't Get Along)\\". But those titles might inadvertently reflect a bit more frustration than I actually experienced with Cowboys and Aliens (plus those titles just weren't really very clever). So instead of trying to express my opinion of this flick in the title of my review, I'll just briefly say it since I'm so late to the party here.<br /><br />I actually thought that Cowboys and Aliens started off quite well. The story seemed to be progressing towards a climactic, epic finish. The plot builds with a lot of fun, but clich&eacute;, Wild West bad guys, sheriffs, drunks and posses bickering about this and that. Seems like a decent, well done Western...and then the aliens show up and the movie goes from pretty good to pretty silly.<br /><br />I do think that the acting was quite good. It has Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Keith Carradine, Sam Rockwell and Olivia Wilde....A great cast with Iron Man's Jon Favreau directing. The cast sold me on sticking with the film with an open mind, and while the CGI was excellent the action became goofy and unrealistic.<br /><br />I was entertained (and I'll probably even give the movie another watch-through when it comes to cable). But ultimately, Cowboys and Aliens is a rental at best; don't waste your money on purchasing the DVD.

0575083093|4.0|Where to start?  This is a book of some complexity and enormous scale. It ranges from the sub-atomic to unbelievably large rents in space-time. From petty human conflicts to the fate of humanity. It's a BIG book, in all senses of the word. Humans have spread out into space using huge sub-light starships called lighthuggers. No hyperspace here. Time is not circumvented, in fact, it is material to the sequence of events. The main characters are well fleshed-out and believable. The \\"scenery\\" of the tale is for the most part well-described too.  The tale twists and turns and delights, but sometimes almost gets lost in the minutiae of the descriptions. This is my basic reason for not giving it five stars. I love intricate tales as well as more basic science fiction fare, but sometimes you can be a little too verbose. This is a personal opinion and others would be right to disagree with my thoughts on the matter.  Suffice to say, that I have already bought two other books from this author, set in the same universe, and will be starting one of them as soon as I finish this review.  Final thoughts on the matter?  A good solid read. You will not be disappointed.  Buy it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Well... it's a tie with the first book. This book is not a fairy tail. People who love a good twilight romance novel might not like it. This is a bloody war story that shows everyones decent into madness and how they reclaim their lives during and after the war.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider solitaire for my kindle fire, performs smoothly, never any glitches. Its perfect for sleepless nights or when I wanna kill some time. It makes me think and I'm always trying to beat my best game time. I would recommend this for fellow fire users.

Patti takes her readers right into the middle of a singular time and place in contemporary American social history, culture, and rock and roll. Fearlessly honest storytelling... A story about self-discovery and self-creation. A story about the passionate pursuit of art. A story about affection and devotion that endure through the many twists and turns of life.

B006C1DH92|5.0|The original Fruit Ninja game was very good.  This new Puss in Boots version goes up another level bacause of the Bandito option.  There seems to be unending possibilities on how fruits and bombs are going to show. So, its never boring.  Also good is that the Bandito game is shorter, so you can have some fun and go back to do whatever you are supossed to be doing.  Graphics in K-Fire are excellent quality.  The precision of your finger when slashing fruits is pretty good too.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|I orderd this DVD set for my son who loves Dino's and all the Jurassic Park movies and I am very happy! The package arrived promptly and everything is in great condition! The DVD's are great quality and we are all very pleased... But most of all my Son is very happy! Thank You!
B002ZG981E|5.0|This film in Blu-ray is dazzling and DON'T MISS OUT ON A \\"FREE\\" VIEWING OPTION! 2 disc Blu-ray, indeed, has 2 Blu-ray discs, plus a DVD disc, plus a Digital Copy insert that states in small lettering at the top \\"DIGITAL COPY OFFER EXPIRES MAY 06, 2011.\\" Since I read earlier complaints about this 2011 expiration date, and since WB had repackaged this set without external reference to Digital Copy, I made purchase only for Blu-ray version of the film (at a great sale price).  Was downloading Digital Copies from some other flicks, recalled the insert for \\"Inception\\" and being a knucklehead followed instructions for what I was sure would be mildly dispiriting psychic concussion. \\"Oh my giant blue head!\\" WB redeemed itself by extending the Digital Copy expiration date to 12/19/13! Not expecting such largesse, I am touched by this gesture ... and aching to believe a team of the previously disgruntled did an implantation to a honcho at WB!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I cant stop coming back to challenge myself. I find myself playing just to see what else I can unlock.
0156027321|4.0|This book was so well written and descriptive that I had a hard time putting it down. The middle slows down enough that you may become board, but it picks up again. It is written as an autobiography, but is actually a work of fiction.  It was hard to read at times but is a good book to ask yourself what you would be willing to go through just to live.
B002BWP49M|4.0|I do love The Twilight series and i am an older person. The ones who make the movie go for kids watching it only and that is far from the truth. The last book Breaking Dawn actually, i was disappointed. I did not like the view switching off Bella to Jacob. It should have been Edward...but should have stayed with Bella and Edward as to their thoughts etc. But, Waiting through 3 novels wondering when he was going to bite her and for them to get married..then there is hardly no honeymoon at all.. I was hoping the movie would be more romantic with at least showing as much as TV does. It was like, did they do it or not? I feel there should have been more scenes of Bella and Edward..not naked, but kissing ..cudding..making one think they were having sex on the honeymoon and after. It was too short, as to, they have sex 3 times in the book..twice in the movie and suddenly she is pregnant! Then, She turns away from Edward..who is her husband for gosh sakes and runs to Rosalie whom always disliked her...She could care less if she dies, if Edward has any say about the baby, if the baby is going to be a monster..instead all she cares about is that it is born..the whole point of the previous 3 novels/movies was for her to be with Edward and for him to bite her and have sex....I got married wehn i was 17 and pregnant by 18 and i can tell you, i did not even think of it as real until it was born and if they would have told me it was going to kill me etc...i certainly would not have went through the pregnancy. I remember too, being embarrassed by putting on sexy nightie or being naked. One thing, starting with the swim when they first arrive at The Isle could have been more romantic. Why cant they have an extended version at least on DVD that shows more? Edward always seemed to me like he had no desire to have sex with Bella and after he finally does it and sees he did not kill her...he never wants to do it again...even though she is happy and doesn't care that she has bruises..odd that she never feels pain..broken bones..bites etc...amd the honeymoon playing chess for gosh sakes! What couple just married would want to sit around playing chess? They would be out shopping, or touring or cudding on the beach etc.....Anyway..overall i was disappointed.....They also left out the parts where Jacob kept insulting Rose...the part that she has a new fancy car....I did not like it that they did not show the complete vows at the wedding..just bits of it....I was hoping the DVD i purchased might have an extened version of scenes they cut, but no such luck....I have seen movies on normal TV that show more of a couple on a honeymoon than this movie did....I was sort of stunned..not giving away ending..but they ended it like another popular movie.....Also..Why do the Cullens look different in each movie? Different hair styles etc..? I wish SM would write a book about Renesmee at least..but guess she is rich and could care less now...The bond between Bella and Edward seems to be missing in this movie and overall..i thought they could have done better with this film..or at least put a longer version out on DVD. This film seems to be afraid some 10 year old might see Bella and Edward having sex...for gosh sakes, it is the theme..them having sex for first time......at least they did not take focus off Bella like they did in the book....after 3 movies..looks like the Directors would have learned something..but overall, the 1st movie had more of the feel of the book...the relationship and the way they looked..especially Edward..in the next movies they have him dressed up in suits etc and he looks nothing like a 17 year old..and the 4 books are only like a year and a half time spam, so why do The Cullens etc etc always look so different? It seemed to me, SM'ers view of marriage is to not have sex, or as little as possible and having a baby is ultimate even if death comes from it....Do ones duty, no matter what!

0312641893|5.0|Without a doubt this is the best fairy tale re-telling that I have read to date.  To be completely honest..there were many moments where I would forget that it was a retelling at all until something popped up at me and made me smile at the comparison.<br /><br />This book draws one in from the first page and propels one along until the last...where one stops and says...\\"Noooooo!  I have to wait for book 2?!?!\\"  The language is sophisticated and flows beautifully and to be quite honest ..did not read at all like a YA novel to me.  The world building was also absolutely amazing...I could vividly picture the futuristic big city with it's grittier and more old world type components like the marketplace.<br /><br />The characters made the book come alive.  I loved Cinder from the beginning and relished in the sweet and well developed romance between herself and Kai.  The secondary characters of Iko and Peony quickly found their way into my heart.  And I loved hating Adri.<br /><br />Issues of discrimination, conflict, love and sacrifice build as this novel hurtles one toward it's conclusion...a conclusion that may have been a bit predictable...but still managed to be 100% satisfying.<br /><br />NOTE: I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.

0321356683|5.0|I've read first edition once and second edition three times, and I have always learned something. This is definitelly the stuff that programmers should care about more and it makes every Java programmers slightly (or even hugely) better. If I should pick the only book about Java I would ever read, this is it.  I hope that after releasing Java 8 (it's early 2012 as I am writing this), Josh will write 3rd edition :)
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I'm not going to bother giving my opinion on the content of the movie, you can search all over the net if you're interested in that.  Overall, it's a pretty decent transfer (averages from 12-20ish mbps). Sound is excellent. The skynet edition is pretty interesting, the menus are some of the coolest looking I've seen.  A great buy at the price.
0596007124|5.0|Before you waste your time on reading numerous articles and reading very long discussions on internet about design patterns, stop. Go get this book and you'll see how easy can it be. I loved how funky (even childish?) this book was. Examples are great and not too small or too large and are easy to remember.  The only downside is that I read pre-generics version, it would be nice to have generified design patterns from those authors.

B004LUS390|3.0|I would've given this app five stars, because it is after all a wonderful app. HOWEVER, I saw today that an update was available: I just downloaded it two minutes ago. When I opened the app, the cover would appear and then a new page. The new page stays open for five seconds before the program closes itself. I can't even make a mark on it before it shuts down! Is this some sort of app virus I should be aware of or did the creators just send out a faulty update to the masses? Anyway, buy the program and beware the update.
B004XQO90O|3.0|This is a technically well-made film featuring Jake Gyllenhaal, who is is adding to his rep as a versatile actor.  And more-than-adequate performances are turned in by all concerned.  The major difficulty is that the scientific premise underlying all the goings on is not well explained.  It seems  to be that people's memories persist for 8 minutes after death, and the federales have a computer program that gloms onto these memories and can then insert Jake into them, where he can carry out tasks not performed by the original owner of the memories.  How a remote computer collects memories from a specific dead individual and inserts someone into them is not dealt with.  Then it turns out that Jake himself is a GI returned from battle in a mostly dead state so that when his usefulness to the computer program ends, so does he.  But at the penultimate instant in his tenuous life, this turns out to be not the case at all -- Oh, happy day!  One suspects this is a second ending devised to satisfy some marketing manager's fear of alienating the audience.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|well this is a very good game(s) really fun for younger kids too! its good for a time or times when all you want to do is relax
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|so far seems like a fun game,  you can actually find the items, and it's in a format I. like.  whether it's worth the money, I don't know yet, but bought it because hidden item games in this format are hard to find!

B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Another good addition to the angry birds franchise. No reason to purchase the &quot;ad free&quot; version Bc its definitely NOT
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The game is stable (Moto Droid X), allows to kill precisely as much free time as you have at disposal, i.e. loads fast and the game sessions are short; get one and you&rsquo;ll be busy for quite some time.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|nice game app for kids, a lot of time wasteing mini games. and that's why we get them. I like the fact it makes you work for them and not have to pay for them so many other apps are just fund vultures for just a little boost
B000MV8XPG|4.0|Immediate success with our 4-year-old grandson who specifically asked his parents for an \\"escabador.\\"  He got right on it and started working the shovel controls.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is a little difficult for him to find the floor to move the digger because the wheel base is so wide with not much room on the sides between the wheels.  He'll persevere, but it's a learning process.  It also does not move well on carpet, but I knew that would be a problem.  It's winter, so using it outside is difficult in the frozen north; warmer weather will permit him to take it outside.
B0001CCXGG|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the G3 releases, although my all time favorite has to be 1996's [[ASIN:0738900370 G3 - Live in Concert]].  Given that, this release holds something special for me; tending to be more of a Satriani fan, there was something unique about his tone that has not been captured on any other recording.  (Probably due to the fact that he was in the prototype stages of his then new Peavey JSX amp, and it was being tweaked after every gig).  In fact, if you look closely at his amp, you can see it is still in a Peavey XXX cabinet, as the JSX had yet to be designed!  As I said this show captures what is probably my all-time favorite Satriani tone.  I, along with others, was a bit disappointed that the CD contained different songs than the DVD.  If you haven't yet experienced the G3 extravaganza, this is as good of a place as any to start.  These may be collectors items some day, as G3's are becoming few and far between now days...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hours and hours of fun. you definitely won't get bored with this one. so many games and it's super easy to earn points.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|my opinion is that this game is the most amazing game of the world I thing that angry birds are the best .
0316010669|3.0|I'll do what Gladwell suggests inside the first chapters, \\"Thin-Slicing,\\" where one brings all one's experience and intuition to bear in the first impressions of the book. It's a nice book for the safe discussion of what clever scientific observation would say normally goes on inside our skins. That's it. Unless you're in a field where you want to determine how people make decisions in popular culture, get this book from a lending library and save the shekels. This is a book I've read to find out why it sold well.<br /><br />And I'll offer this: it's a pleasant read with very interesting anecdotes. It could give more courage to your convictions that skill isn't always backed by decades of experience. But this is not a book to provide pointers on how to develop your skills in thinking without thinking. You already know how to do that. Those skills are called intuition and instinct.<br /><br />Maybe I'll change this review after I finish the book ;)
B005HSL626|5.0|I thing that fruit ninjas is the best ninjas of the world all my family likes this game.is the best.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a great movie! I purchased for my husband who wanted his own copy immediately after we watched it together. We have a small DVD collection and this was a nice addition. The DVD was nicely packaged and in shrink wrap, not unlike any other movie purchased at local stores. This is one of many that I have ordered from Amazon, and don't anticipate a single issue or problem =)
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I was lucky and found this item for 200 on Amazon.  It was advertised as used-like new, but it was packaged new in the box and obviously unused.<br /><br />The screen CAN DO 1080P!  It just is set Native to 720P.  First thing I did was change the setting on the xbox to display 1080P.  The built in speakers are decent but not great, but it comes with a headphone jack built in so it helps.  I left everything on for 12 hours to test the durability, and the xbox did not get too hot, which was one of my concerns.<br /><br />I only really have 2 gripes.<br /><br />1.  No remote for the screen.  This isnt too big of a deal, but being a convenience item, every little thing matters!<br />2.  The screen is kind of odd.  You have to look straight on to see everything, or things get kind of discolored.<br /><br />Overall, I did give the product a 5 out of 5 because for the price, even if I had paid 300, it is a good deal and this product is very well made for the price.  Also, this product can hopefully be used for future consoles!  I would like in the future for there to possibly be a higher end version with a nicer screen, better sound system, and a shoulder strap.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I recently bought this app. I LOVE it! Who really cares about updates? It is great already. The um only thing that should be changed is the second to last world thing is EASY. They should change that. Otherwise I LOVE this app!!
0307891402|5.0|Im glad I bought the hard back version. Its a lot nicer than the paper back, and if you use it a lot like I do you will like how it holds up. Mine still looks brand new. Its very helpful showing you extra areas, letting you know what going to happen when you make a decision, and the over all detail and ease of use is great.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Having not seen reruns of this show in over 30 years, the show feels brand new in a lot of respects.<br /><br />I'd found Season 1 and 2 of the Bionic Woman right before Christmas and was enjoying it so much, then on Christmas I found season one of TSMDM under my tree.  How cool is that?  Especially since my 8 year old is discovering these shows for the first time and think that they are totally awesome.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy this game. its very addicting. its hard for me to put it down.  I also like being able to design the background. I play this game a lot.

B002VHI8FE|4.0|The Blade Itself is part of the \\"gritty fantasy\\" movement which has recently come to the forefront of adult fantasy literature, thanks to the highly publicized works of George R.R. Martin.  Unlike \\"high fantasy,\\" which is embodied in Lord of the Rings and its many clones, \\"gritty fantasy\\" doesn't follow the common formula of the unlikely protagonist versus an evil dark lord.  In addition to containing lots of violence, \\"gritty fantasy\\" tends to discard simplified notions of right and wrong, favoring a more complex world where moral decisions are often muddled in shades of gray.  Heroes and villains aren't easy to distinguish in these stories since everyone seems to have reasons for acting in the manner that they do.  Another hallmark of gritty fantasy is the concept that \\"no one is safe.\\"  Because there's no single protagonist bent on saving the world, any character is expendable - adding an  element of uncertainty to the story.  If what I've described doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then it's unlikely you'll enjoy what author Joe Abercrombie has to offer here.  However, if this type of format intrigues you, then you will likely appreciate (and very much enjoy) what you find.<br /><br />The Blade Itself is the first in a trilogy known as \\"The First Law.\\"  The story follows the perspectives of six characters throughout, but most of the story centers around the following three: a barbarian who's attempting leave behind a dark past, a crippled torturer who's best years are behind him, and an arrogant noble who's training for a sword tournament to win himself some glory.  It's difficult to summarize the plot without giving too much away, but the first volume tends to act as an introductory volume to the greater story contained in the subsequent installments.  Indeed, some readers have criticized this first book for seeming directionless at times, but the significance of  conversations and actions aren't fully felt until later in the trilogy.  That isn't to say the story isn't interesting in this first installment, because it certainly is.  The reader just won't start getting a grasp for the big picture until later.<br /><br />Joe Abercrombie's writing style is in the same vein of a modern action thriller.  Sentences are regularly short and have a conversational tone about them.  However unlike most action thrillers you'll find, the characterization here is beyond good.  It's simply fantastic.  These aren't characters of the cookie-cutter variety.  These are characters with hopes, dreams, faults, and fears.  Abercrombie does an amazing job bringing the reader into his world because of his spot-on descriptions and portrayals.  What's interesting to me is how effective this method is.  Oftentimes we see fantasy authors who get lost in their world-building - spending ridiculous amounts of time detailing politics, history, or some obscure geography.  This frequently comes at the expense of good storytelling.  None of that is a problem here as Abercrombie seamlessly weaves those points through the story without overemphasis.  The more you follow the plot, the greater the overall picture becomes.  It's also worth noting that there are quite a few  laugh-out-loud moments throughout Abercrombie's narration.  Much of the humor is deadpan which works quite well with the dark themes being explored.<br /><br />One critique I have for Abercrombie's writing is the overabundance of swearing.  First off, everyone in this trilogy swears: lords, ladies, peasants, wizards, soldiers, and even children.  Secondly, the swearing is nonstop - almost whenever there's conversation.  Bluntly put, it's overkill.  For some readers it'll be a deal-breaker, which is really a shame.  But hopefully in time, Abercrombie will come up with some alternative ways of expression.<br /><br />If my description of \\"gritty fantasy\\" wasn't clear enough, understand that this book is chock-full of violence.  Heads roll, body parts are crushed, and graphic descriptions accompany each gruesome encounter.  Some sex will be sprinkled throughout the books that follow as well.  All of this is R-rated material.  Keeping that in mind, it's all quite entertaining if you have the stomach for it.<br /><br />The Blade Itself is the beginning to a deep and interesting world, populated with some even more interesting characters.  If you decide to embark on this yarn through the mud, just be prepared to get a little dirty.  Bring some galoshes and you'll have great fun.will be sprinkled throughout the books that follow as well.  All of this is R-rated material.

0439023491|5.0|As an adult reader who enjoys Shakespeare as well as modern fiction, I must say I was skeptical of this series. When I read The Hunger Games, I was surprised at how well written and gripping the storyline was. In my mind, there was no way that Catching Fire would be nearly as good. I was once again, surprised. The second installment of the series was just as compelling, and I couldn't put it down. Collins has a way with words that is hard to find nowadays.... On my must read list.
1577312082|5.0|I listen to a lot of spiritual teachings from different \\"teachers\\". Eckert Tolle is one I continue to come back to. It's a reminder for me to center myself with this calmness that somehow only this \\"teacher\\" has been able to do. Others for the most part rally around the same teachings which reinforces what it is that \\"The Power of Now\\" has to offer. I would start here which puts you in this place and gives you the ground work to spring forth and make sense of what's being taught by others. Unless I'm missing something, I have yet to come across anyone who can make the delivery quite like he can. You could very well find yourself coming back again and again which is how these teachings work.  Charlotte
B006W0QR1S|5.0|This was an awesome \\"scarface\\" movie definitely redeeming me from the night my girlfriend and I watched The Notebook!!!!  The Mustang was kickass too!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I have just completed the trilogy and am now in the early stages of withdrawal. When I began the first book (Dragon Tatoo) i complained to my sons about their recommendation. The book moved slowly as it introduced the characters and set up the plot. Their response was that it would change halfway through the book. At that point it became a \\"Fasten Your Seatbelts\\" ride.<br /><br />Firstly, Lisbeth Salander is perhaps the most unusual and compelling character I have encountered. Your opinion of her may change as the trilogy progresses but she will never bore the reader. As the story moves through the three volumes, I found myself repeatedly surprised by the twists, turns, and complications. My wife got used to hearing me exclaim \\"WHAT?\\" after reading quietly for a while.<br /><br />Have patience as you meet the characters in the first book, and then then jump into murder, mystery, and mayhem in Sweden. Once the story takes off in the first book, it never lets up through the next two.
B001LF347E|5.0|Season one was amazing and I absolutely loved the characters, all of them. You get drawn in and you don't want them to end.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|If you like Brothers, you will like El Camino. Black Keys have delivered another awesome album.  Can you still call them albums??
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is in a class of its own.  Engaging, fast-paced, an epic that doesn't bog you down with a hundred different point of views or side story arcs.  The story itself follows that of Vaelin Al Sorna, a scared young boy who grows up to be a natural born leader and strategist, feared and respected throughout the world.  He reminded me of Inda from the Sherwood Smith books, destined from birth to be of great import to the realm, bonded to his brothers through shared hardships, denied satisfaction and relief to fulfill his duty.  Cunning and intelligent, with enough compassion to walk the line between warrior and murderer, he fights with ruthless efficiency to make a difference, to try and do the right thing when all it seems his actions accomplish is more suffering, all the while battling his own inner demons and self-doubt.  There are some strong themes present, of growing up and of lost innocence, of sacrifice and of betraying your morals and beliefs.  The structure of the book was reminiscent of \\"The Name of the Wind\\" in that it's told from the perspective of a scribe/historian chronicling the deeds of our protagonist as he narrates his tale in the present.  This device does not detract from the story and break the immersion, rather it serves to set the scene for each consecutive portion of Vaelin's life, bringing the events that take place full circle; it does not in fact reveal the plot, but only adds to the suspense.  The world-building was solid.  Never did I lack for any visual representation of the lands discussed, magical/religious/cultural systems mentioned, or felt confused about how things came to be.  The fact that this enormous tome could be purchased for the price of a soda astounds me.  With such a high degree of writing and storytelling that kept me enraptured almost a full day and a half, I'd have expected it to have cost at least ten times as much and come with a number of literary awards attached.  It really is one of those books I'll probablyremember for the rest of my life.
B005EYP8PO|5.0|I've been waiting for this to be remastered for some time, it does't dissapoint.  Packaging is minimal and the extra songs, although I previously had them, are nice to be all on one disc.  The sound is great, the re-master brings out parts that were buried in the mix and really helps to focus on the overall mood of the recordings.  THis was accomplished without taking anything away from the original.  BRAVO!
B004LUS390|2.0|This app was well worth the money on the Kindle Fire...until the latest update.  Now, the screen tries to divide into sections, and when you attempt to draw something, the mark or line appears on each of the sections and about an inch away from your finger or, in my case, stylus.  Before, this app was a great drawing app, and went above and beyond anything I would have expected on a mobile device.  However, after the update, the app force closes most of the time when I try to open it, and if it manages to stay open longer than three seconds, the section problem occurs.  Please make this app how it used to be!
0380973839|5.0|The Martian Chronicles was a book. I read it. It was really good. The martians are red and I can relate to this because the martians are red. I like martians, but I like marshmallows more. Anyway, I recomend this book.    I recomend this martian because everyone can relate. People these days are really weird. They walk the streets day and night looking for food. If I was a martian, I'd read this book.    Additionally, I loved this book because of its sophisticated diction and wild wild west. The words in this book blew me away. They used the word martian a lot and the book was about martians so I was satisfied. The wild west is too much to handle but this book is about martians.    Finally, martians can speak and beak. I read this book and now I am well bred. This book really spoke to me. I realized that now Mars is a planet. The planetarians aren't just for planets no more. Martians book I read.    In conclusion, I recomend this book X1000. It was the best and I'm a martian book reader.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|Like others have said, read what you're getting before the download. You start with 10 games, need to unlock the rest, but the points you need to earn will rapidly outgrow the points you'll earn from multiple play sessions.<br /><br />The games are quick one-trick ponies that last about a minute. A good run will get you about 5K-6K points (higher scores can be earned from the more expensive unlocks).  There are also bonuses for clearing a game the first time, visiting daily, and a few simple achievements like \\"clear every game on this screen.\\"<br /><br />Problem is, the unlocks get more and more expensive.  Games start at 30,000 to unlock, then jump to 90K, 120K, and eventually take over 600,000 points per unlock!  You can get quick points by reviewing the game (250,000 - explains all the reviews this one has!) or fulfilling the requirements from various advertisements (most of which won't work on the Kindle Fire).  You'll also get hit with a full-screen ad every three games you play.<br /><br />A fun little diversion,  but the games have no \\"meat\\" to them, will take an eternity to unlock (unless you cheat the system and invest in an expensive game first - the more expensive the game, the better the point gains!).  At 25 Meg on the space-limited Fire, it's worth a look for an hour or two, but probably not a keeper.

B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|It's funny how Microsoft had their \\"Game Room\\" application a couple years back where they were selling most of the games from this collection (even ones like Human Cannonball!) for $3 each.  Now you can pick-and-choose the ones you might want for a third of that price, or get the entirety of them for only $10.<br /><br />However, if Missile Command is any indication of how the others games are, it might not be worth the investment - the sound is poorly emulated [at least on the Kindle Fire], playing incomplete noises (and later than they should be).  Which might not seem relevant if you weren't a part of \\"that era,\\" but for those that grew up with the noises, not having the correct sounds is just as bad as playing a Mario game if the jumping and 1-up noises were screwed up.<br /><br />I can't give a full-fledged review because I haven't invested in the entire package (and won't without knowing more about the sound of the other games), but Missile Command seems to PLAY faithfully to the arcade version, and it's neat to have a \\"trackball\\" like motion with the touch screen.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really love this game. It is really fun. Thank you so much for this wonderful game and waiting for my rating on it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun. the only problem I have with the game is that the ads pop up in the middle of playing games. it pauses but if your concentrating it is very distracting.
B004FOA84A|2.0|if you love Myst and 7th Guest, you will be sorely disappointed by this game. Since there's very few real puzzles, they should be more complex. The creator would have been better off making this an ad-supported free game given the lack of quality.  Needs more content, even if it would be some cheesy item hunts to pass the time. The graphics were nice, yet the environment isn't really smooth in transition, and hardly interactive... so there's no novelty of using your device's motion sensors or zoom capabilities. if someone is paying for a game, it should provide more than ten minutes of entertainment to build a good customer base.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I absolutely love playing solitaire and the fact that its on kindle is great for me...such a classic card game!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love simple games like these. I play this for hours! Keeps me entertained while the hubby is asleep and when I can't go to sleep! Hebe. ;)

B0058VW36U|5.0|Cute, addictive, fun.  It's great, well worth the dollar I paid for it.  One of the better game apps I've played in a while.  Keeps challenging you, but not so hard it's frustrating,  Nice game play, and new interesting levels.  I love it.
1451627289|5.0|11/22/63 is a time travel story. Does this mean that the main character, Jake Epping, goes back in time and sees events that he always wanted to see? Change what he wants to change? Kind of, sort of. Since it's Stephen King, is it scary? Well, not in any traditional sense, no. Is this book about JFK? Eh.....<br />So if these questions and answers have you baffled, wondering why you should read a Stephen King book that is about JFK but at the same time is not, then good. This story, 11/22/63 is a romance. It's a story in love with it's time, place, and about the romance between a man from 2011 and a woman from the 1960's.<br />And it's beautiful to say the least.<br />Yes, the story is interesting, exciting, and suspenseful with just the right amount of strange King-ness that it feels just like coming home. For me, personally, it felt even more so when Jake arrives in Derry, Maine a few months after the events of IT took place in 1958. It's strange to have such a feeling about a work of fiction, but King does it and it feels right.<br />While this book may not be his finest, it's certainly up there with his best stories. He writes a taut narrative, it delivers everything you could ask of it in spades. JFK may be mentioned a lot, but he doesn't appear too much in person. And it works. Lee Harvey Oswald is in fact a more important character throughout the novel, as he should be. He's the villain after all, an unknown villain to his victims, but a villain none the less.<br />If you like Stephen King, check this book out. If you like Science Fiction, check this book out. If you're a romantic at heart, check this book out. If you read, if you like books, if you like a great yarn, then please. Check out this book.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|I have had lots of cell phones, but this is my first time to buy a cover. And, i have to say it makes a difference. It really offers good protection to your investment , its much more scratch resistant than the original phone, and absorbs any shocks from drops or slams. The otterbox is esthetically pleasing and doesn't affect the pocket-ability of the phone (phone is very slim to begin with). Also , it ships with a screen protector which ensures that the package doesn't leave a single part of the phone unprotected.

B006TGX27M|4.0|I like the tracks I have heard so far. That is, the ones that downloaded with the complete song. Maybe you should wait awhile as four of the tracks downloaded with only half the of the song. I have never had aproblem before with any of the music I have downloaded in the past. Maybe iTunes will have the album in its complete form.

B000086EPF|5.0|W.A.S.P. is a great hard rock/heavy metal band. These two albums are worh having by themselves but to get them together was most excellent. Inside the Electric Circus is charged with sex but not on every track. The shock of the sexual content on some of the material sometimes makes it hard for people to appreciate the other kick-a** rockers on there that don't get into any gimmicky areas. The Headless Children continues the great hard rock of Inside the Electric Circus but it's a more mature and socially conscious collection of songs.
B000274THQ|5.0|This movie is a great adult oriented film.  It does have some few seconds of sexual material, so it makes one a bit uneasy when their teenage son and daughter are watching it!  But, I loved this movie, it was very, very creative.

B006ZBRMOU|4.0|I have to say, I'm not impressed with the 3rd book, but it was a nice closure to the series. When I finished this book, I'm glad it's over. There's nothing more to discuss with Ana and Christian anymore. E.L. James is a very good author and I will read more of her books. I noticed the price for kindle went up and that's a bit upsetting in these economic times. Might be going back to the good ole library.
1932100660|5.0|This is a MUST read for anyone that cares about their health and the health of their loved ones.  I read it once straight through and now use it as a resource book, as it is easy to go back to specific topics/chapters to review.  It is a GREAT additional to our collection for living well, fighting disease, and not giving into what so many \\"so called\\" experts tell us we must eat/consume or what medications/treatments are recommended according to governmental or the special interests.  Enough said...you will NOT be disappointed.  Read it, check out the resources for yourself, and apply what you find to be true and/or helpful.  God bless.

0439023513|4.0|This book was pretty great. I love post-apocalyptic stories, movies, etc. So this book fit right in. The amount of time spent in a few other districts satisfied my hunger for post-apocalyptic struggle. The only reason I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars, and I'll try and do this without spoiling anything, is because the ending was wayyyyy too abrupt. But the action, story, etc. in this book was all extremely well done imo.

B004FOA84A|5.0|I had a great time with this game. The puzzles are logical and, instead of pixel hunting, you know which objects are interactive. The puzzles are just obscure enough for a challenge. My experience was bug-free, smooth, and very enjoyable. Thanks, for this fun game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it helped me learn the Word with daily Bible readings and also has a wide variety of languages that can help with mission work.

You are also able to access the word in any version of the Bible. I love this app. The only downside is that it requires the Internet. Try it it's worth it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a fantastic read although slightly cunfusing in the end. I could hardly put it down. This book is an absolute must read for all.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Let me start by saying I'm a big baseball fan and I think Brad Pitt is excellent in his performance as Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane. I also think Jonah Hill is superb and earns his best supporting actor nomination as made-up Yale-educated baseball statistician \\"Peter Brand\\". It is worth noting that it is Brand's real-life ideas, embodied by on-field application of real-life statistician Bill James' Sabermetrics, that make up the heart and soul of \\"Moneyball\\" - both the film and the idea.<br /><br />Beane's A's have had some success. In 2001 with a roster that cost a third of the high-ballin' Yankees the A's take the mighty Yanks down to the last game of the playoffs prior to losing, then losing stars Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi and Jason Isringhausen to teams that can afford their now high-price salaries. (From an even playing field standpoint, Major League Baseball is still miles behind any American ideal of \\"fairness\\".) Beane is \\"rewarded\\" with the task of rebuilding the A's with the available funds to attract... no one.<br /><br />He goes to another organization to talk a trade and notices Brand in the corner whispering in the ear of a rival general manager. Beane, who was a professional player himself, knows that Jonah Hill doesn't look like anyone's idea of a sports guy. He tracks him down after the meeting and asks why the Indian's General Manager listens to him.<br /><br />And thus is presented the whole idea of Moneyball: although home runs and batting averages are flashy and show up on Sportscenter highlights, the bottom line in baseball is wins. A walk, while not ostentatious, is pretty much exactly as valuable as a single, and players with good on-base percentages (judiciously mixing walks in with swings of the bat) are as valuable as players with a good batting average.<br /><br />Beane buys into the idea and puts all his eggs into the Moneyball basket, upsetting pretty much everyone else in the organization.  He seems to have nothing to lose - his owner isn't going to provide one of those multi-million dollar contracts, so Beane and Brand have to find bargain players.<br /><br />The drama comes in watching Beane coax and cajole the rest of the A's organization into buying the concept. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays field manager Art Howe, who frankly tells Beane that he thinks the whole experiment is going to get him fired. (My recollection of the real Howe is a thin, gaunt man physically almost completely dissimilar from the moon-faced Hoffman, but hey, it's a movie.)<br /><br />The problem I have with the film is the manner in which they reduce the national pastime, the hope and dream of millions of boys and girls (and boys and girls at heart) to a cold, statistical business. I don't know the real Billy Beane. I suspect that they model many of his film idiosyncrasies on real life, such as the fact that he doesn't travel with the team or even go out to the field to watch the games. For the little boy in me this makes as much sense as changing the end of Willy Wonka to put the Chocolate Factory away in the closet and watch it occasionally on television.<br /><br />As a \\"renegade businessman upsetting the apple-cart\\" story, Moneyball works. After all, the screenplay is by that double-dog genius of screenwriters, Aaron Sorkin. As a baseball movie - it's not even as fun as watching batting practice.one of those multi-million dollar contracts, so Beane and Brand have to find bargain players.

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|\\"The Descendants\\" is going to be a really big disappointment to people who think that life should mirror the kind of interactions you see on \\"Jerry Springer\\" or that every movie should include gun fights or car chases. I'll go ahead and drop this spoiler: there is hardly a whiff of any of the above.<br /><br />George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer in Hawai'i whose family is partially descended from King Kamehameha. Although they're now \\"about as Haole as you can get\\", the family still has the rights to a beautiful and large tract of prime real estate on Kaua'i. As the movie opens the family is contemplating a big decision: the rest of the family are not successful Honolulu lawyers and selling the land will set up the rest of the family nicely.<br /><br />But the real estate plot plays in the background for the main storyline. As the film opens Matt's wife is in a coma that occurred in a boating accident off Waikiki. The Doctor tells Matt in the opening scene that it is hopeless - Elizabeth King shows no evidence of brain activity and her living will instructs everyone to discontinue life support. The Doctor tells Matt to let everyone know so they can say good-bye.<br /><br />This begins an emotional Odyssey for Clooney's character. There are two King Daughters: Ten year old Scottie, played by Amara Miller, who is acting out and having difficulty at school after Mom's accident, and seventeen year old Alexandra, played by Shailene Woodley, who was apparently having difficulty before the accident. Alex has been shipped to a boarding school and she is none too eager to reconcile with Dad or cut Mom any slack just because of a little coma. Robert Forster is realistically gruff and bitter as the father of comatose Elizabeth - he blames Matt for being a neglectful husband - driving Elizabeth to the thrill-seeking lifestyle that resulted in the accident.<br /><br />In his quest to let family and friends know they need to say their final farewells to wife Elizabeth, Matt discovers information that causes a seismic shift in his view of his dying wife and of the real estate deal he has been working on for months.<br /><br />In this portion of the film special notice goes to Beau Bridges as Cousin Hugh who represents the \\"you're not going to let down the WHOLE FAMILY are you, Matt?\\" side of the King clan, and Nick Krause as Alex's friend Sid, who shows that in Hawai'i, where type A personalities are as hard to find as a snowstorm, you can't always judge a person's intelligence by their appearance or demeanor. Sid looks like any of the Beach Bums on the North Shore, but in a few telling scenes he offers Matt invaluable insight.<br /><br />Clooney well-deserves his Oscar nomination for his performance. Matt was never a man of action, and in this film there are a few moments where he specifically chooses NOT to act. In the audience we can see his pain, and we know there are times that a lesser, more vindictive person would have escalated the proceedings with a \\"Springer-Style\\" knock-down drag-out. But this isn't that kind of movie, and I'm grateful to have not been dragged into the viewing mud.mic shift in his view of his dying wife and of the real estate deal he has been working on for months.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|Why the end of LOST not only worked, but was truthfully the most fitting conclusion the writer's could have given us...  LOST is one of the most important television programs in the history of syndicated story telling. Period. Genre-bending, ground-breaking, budget-busting, gloriously epic both in terms of character development and the scope of it's intricately-woven, mystery-laced narrative, LOST is the most unique television show ever produced. This note is me finally attempting to put down in words what the end of LOST really meant, and why it is the most satisfying ending fans could have ever hoped for.  It has been 1 year and 7 months to the day since LOST ended its six-year run on ABC. During that time-period I have watched the entire show over, and had time to really let my thoughts and feelings sink in. I have moved past the point where I believed the show was perfect in every way, and have achieved a new, and even deeper appreciation for what was done right.  To understand what the end of LOST was really about, we need to understand what the whole show was about. The title `'LOST'' proved to be a loaded one. During the first two seasons of the show we are introduced to the lives of all 14 major characters prior to their crashing on the Island. These first two seasons let us know what the show is focused on: the characters. Each and every one of these characters is geographically lost on this island, yes. However, They are also `'lost'' spiritually, emotionally, and in almost every philosophical way you could think of. Jack is a broken man, eaten up by regret and anger stemming from his complicated and often turbulent relationship with his father. A man who is obsessed with fixing things, controlling every situation, and proving his father's decades old sentiment `'you don't have what it takes'' wrong, Jack becomes the de facto leader of the group. His `'live together, die alone'' mentality would prove to be the true motto of the entire show. This show is about a community of people who must come together in order to survive, or they will all die.  John Locke, a man who has believed his whole life that there has to be something more out there than his dead-end 9-5 jobs, a man who never quite fit in, who never quite felt at home, an orphan in every sense of the word. A man who's longing for a purpose, for a home, for meaning in his life, caused him to fall in love with the Island and to be sensitive to it's true nature, even when the others couldn't see it. John's belief in the power of faith and the role of destiny provided the audience with the first piece of the puzzle as to what this dazzling, sprawling story was really all about.  Kate Austen, a woman who is running from her past. From her relationships, from the police, from her fears and self-loathing.  In Kate we find a portrait of a woman who is unable to face herself and move on with her life.  Sayid, a man who was forced to torture people during the gulf war, a man who wants so desperately to believe that there is good in him, but who always ends up believing what others tell him he is, Sayid is a lonely man who never quite grasps that your life is your own to make of it what you will, you are not fated to make the same mistakes in the future by the failures of your past. Sayid is running from his past, instead of facing it, and finding the strength to forgive himself.  Sun and Jin, the love story of the series.  Jin, a man who will do anything it takes to take care of his wife, even if it means risking everything. Sun, a woman who struggles to find her own place in the relationship, who tries so hard to understand Jin's actions, yet ultimately loves him regardless of his mistakes. Their story is a testament to married couple's the world over, a lesson in what it really means to love another person, and to put that person's well-being above your own.  Charlie, the washed up rock star with a heroin addiction. Charlie is running from his past, from his rocky relationship with his brother, and with his own self-doubt and resentment for how his life has turned out.  Claire, the young, single mother who fears for her child's safety, and doubts her ability to be a parent.  Hurley, a lovable average guy who has never harmed anyone a day in his life, but believes he is cursed. He is running from his curse, and what he believes is his mental instability.  Sawyer, a man haunted by his past, filled with deep anger and resentment. A man who cons people for a living because deep down he has never been able to trust anyone besides himself.  Michael, Walt, Shannon, Boone, Ben, Juliet, Miles, Faraday, Widmore, Charlotte, Desmond, Penny, the list continues...but the point becomes clear.  LOST is about a community of people from, 5 different continents who are thrown together. Each of them is running from something. Their past, their mistakes, their personal demons, addictions, and afflictions, broken relationships, broken hearts, shattered dreams, and disappointed relatives. These people, who for so long have been running from themselves, have become LOST. When Oceanic 815 crashes on the island, they are forced together, and not only that, they have nowhere to go, they have no place to run from themselves anymore. They are forced to work together, putting aside their racial, cultural, ethnic, differences in order to survive an island that in almost every way imaginable represents a reflection of themselves.  The Island, the most enigmatic character on the show, is both the setting for these characters' redemption, and the catalyst behind that redemption. Mysterious, baffling, miraculous, dangerous, and of indescribable importance, the island is the key to healing these broken characters.  The ultimate theme of LOST is letting go. Letting go of the past, letting go of anger, failures, mistakes, and broken promises. Letting go of heartache, self-doubts, fears, and addictions. Overcoming the past by finding strength in those around you, surviving both physically and emotionally by forming a community. Each of these characters over the course of the six seasons of the show are tested by the island time and time again in a variety of ways both big and small; obvious and subtle. The Island serves as a judge, counselor, and healer to each of these people, helping them shed their hang-ups, realize who they really are, and grow into the people they were always meant to be. THIS is what LOST is about...finding yourself. Making your own destiny by realizing that the power to do the right thing has always been in your hands. Recognizing the strength that we each have, and the inner sense of what is right and what is wrong, and that the ability to decide to do the right thing is ours and ours alone. It is an individual responsibility, and we can't blame the past, or our fathers, mothers, friends, or other relatives for our failures. We alone are to blame, and we alone have the power to forgive ourselves, to let go, and to move on. This is what the show was about.. The mysteries served to test these characters in ways that kept us hooked, kept us entertained, and served to move the plot forward in a fresh, unique way. But the mysteries were only relevant in how they related to these character's journeys of letting go of the past. By the time the 2 and a half hour series finale rolled around, whether or not each and every little question had been answered paled in comparison to the hope that our character's would find the strength to let go of the past and move on. Would they find the redemption the island so desperately attempted to give them? It is in THIS context that ANY discussion of the finale of LOST MUST begin. The show was about the characters, and it ends with the characters. And, how it ends, in my opinion, is untouchable.  Exciting, frustrating, slightly amusing, beautifully nostalgic, heart-breakingly final, and inexplicably fitting, the finale of LOST stands as one of the greatest closing chaptersin the history of popular fiction. The characters have been presented to us all of seasons 6 in two different time-lines. A world where the Island is of no consequence because flight 815 never crashed, and a universe in which the first five seasons have built to a shocking show-down between our soon-to-be-redeemed heroes and an evil of unspeakable magnitude. The entire final season had us simultaneously scratching our head and biting our fingernails. By the time episode 121, aptly titled `'The End'' aired, we were emotionally exhausted and, like our characters ready to face the ultimate conclusion of what had been a journey of incredible discovery, and deep sacrifice.  Before I explain how the finale perfectly realizes the theme of letting go of the past in order to move on, I must divulge a few spoilers. Without any big, long-winded exegesis, here it goes: The `'side-ways'' world is simply a limbo of sorts where the souls of the characters went AFTER the events of their lives. The characters were real, they all lived, all crashed on the Island, all experienced the dramatic events of the series, and all, eventually, at different times, and in different places, died. When they died, they all ended up in the same `'limbo-verse'', as it were, and we discover, in the most emotionally-charged turns of events of the entire series, and perhaps in television history, that the purpose behind all of this was so they could remember their lives, let go of the past, and move on to the afterlife together.  On the Island, the evil is defeated, and the ultimate hero sacrifices his life to save those he cares for most. The end, which could not have possibly come more full circle, perfectly reflects the beginning of these character's journeys. In the limbo-verse, our characters were given a final opportunity to deal with any unresolved issues they had at the time of their deaths on Earth.  Those who had worked through most of their issues, like Hurley, had significantly better livesin the side-ways world than they ever did during the events we saw of their lives in earlier seasons. But most died with unresolved issues, problems that still needed to be worked out. We see these final issues and obstacles overcome as the characters remember each other, their lives, and the events that have bonded them together into what is now revealed to be a spiritual, as well, as physical community of people. Once each of the characters has remembered their lives, they are free to let go, reunite with the most important people from their lives, and move on. To Where? Someplace where Locke will never need a wheel chair again, somewhere where Kate will never need to worry about being safe ever again. Some place where Sun and Jin will never have to be apart, a place where Sayid would never need to worry about his dark past threatening his happiness. A place where Hurley is loved, accepted, and important. A place where Charlie is clean, free of his depression, and free from the chains that dragged him down during his life on Earth. A place where Desmond will never have to search for Penny, or convince her that he really loves her. A place where Jack knows that his father loves him, and will never have to wonder if he has what it takes. A place where these characters will have found redemption, love, self-assurance, peace, happiness, closure, a future.  Free of the past; free from heartache, free from death, a home. A real destiny, a real purpose. A place where they will no longer be LOST.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|Just some back ground info on me. I am a long time 360 user who mostly plays first person shooters such as COD and not to rub my back, but I'm not awful at them. I purchased this controller because I have a lot of friends that play on PS3 but I absolutely hate the controller. My first 2 consoles where Playstations and the controller was fine when I was 10 and 16 respectively. I now am older and being 6'3 my hands are too big to comfortably hold the PS3 controller in my opinion. Lets be honest Sony, do you really think you got it right the first time and you couldn't have made any improvements? Not to mention I find the Joysticks to be awkward. What I'm trying to get at that I was looking for an exact replica 360 controller only for the ps3. I have played about a days worth of COD and I now think I can give it an honest review.  PRO's:  - Fits in my hand comfortably  - L1 and R1 buttons are nicer than the 360's  - Joysticks are in a good place with similar feel to the 360  - Looks pretty cool with the LED lights  - Wireless controller with pretty good range, not as good as either the PS3 or the 360 but acceptable  - Dual Shock Technology along with sixaxis  - Triggers have nice lip on them and your hand wont slip off  - Great Value considering I got it for $20.  Con's  - Moving the Joystick slightly is not as precise as the 360 or the PS3, but after a couple hours of game play it is manageable, I still find it tough to adjust to longer shots, but it will come with time.  - The plastic grip on it feels a little rough in my opinion (side note: I work with my hands all day, they are callused and by no means little girl hands)  - Trigger buttons are no where near as accurate as the 360 - my simple solution was to use L1 and R1 to aim and shoot like the PS3 has set up by default.  Conclusion: If you are looking for an exact replica of a 360 controller, this is not it. The only way you will achieve that is buy buying the PS3 adapter and a wired controller which is much more expensive. If you are not a serious gamer but like the xbox controller layout I would highly recommend this controller. Overall it did take a little to get used to, but it was well worth the money I spent on it. If I were going to be more competitive on the PS3 like I am the Xbox I would recommend the adapter and wired official 360 controller.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A great resource and bible rolled into one. Great selection of multiple translations, many of which can be downloaded and saved to your device for free. App includes a great bible study tool as well. Installed it on my Xoom and Bionic... works great on both! Use daily as part of my faith studies! Easy to use interface and a note section, that is a great inclusion, but not the most user friendly interface.  That said, a still a strong Five stars!

0545101417|4.0|Of all Suzanne Collins's books I've read so far (the five books of The Underland Chronicles and the three of The Hunger Games trilogy), this one was easily my favorite.  She managed to extend the premise of the first book in a way that made sense without being predictable.  Parts of it were even almost...fun, which is not a word I would apply to any of her other books I've read.
B005FMZVLQ|4.0|This is a really good price for a very nice watch.  It's definitely not a knock-off.  It's a solid, heavy watch, definitely the genuine article.  I'm right handed and the lefty aspect doesn't bother me, the only issue is I'd have to take it off to set the time, but I can easily operate the stopwatch with my right hand while it's on my left wrist.  My only complaint is that the instruction booklet included with the watch doesn't really address this watch specifically.  It has categories of watches that this watch really doesn't fall in to, but after reading through and experimenting I figured out how to set the time and date relatively easy, the only thing I can't figure out is how to re-center the second counter on the stop watch, it doesn't stop right at zero.  It has instructions for how to do that for other watches but it doesn't work for this one.  That's only a minor complaint for what's otherwise a really great looking watch at a great price.  Who's doing serious timing on one of these things anyway? This watch is more for style, not for timing laps at a track or something.
0545091020|3.0|Creating a world in which life itself is literally a zero-sum game, requiring people to kill others in order to live themselves, is bad enough---but creating such a world for kids (both the characters and the audience) is really malevolent. I always hated Lord of the Flies for the same reason. This isn't as bad as that, though---at least here the characters are fighting against the situation, with at least some success.
B005HYNCTK|5.0|Celi's EMI recordings of Bruckner, captured live, are justifiably famous.  Reviled in some corners for their glacial tempos (\\"Slow as compared to what?\\"), this, for me is the end-game of Bruckner recordings.  I have cycles from Karajan, Wand and Jochum, as well as dozens of various recordings of the individual symphonies, and none compare to Celi's unique interpretations.  Recordings like no other of a composer like no other.  If only we had a record of Bruckner's 2nd!  This set WILL go out of print, and soon.  I recommend that if you have any interest in Brucker at all you snap this set up while you still can.
0545265355|3.0|The Hunger Games is the biggest thing since Harry Potter (except for Twilight, but let's just pretend that never happened).  And as someone who worked at bookstores for years when they were being released, I resisted reading Harry Potter for years.  Of course, in that case, when I finally gave in it turned out that the hype was actually justified for once.  So perhaps the best way to explain what I didn't like about these books is by contrasting them with the Harry Potter series, because The Hunger Games really is like the anti-Harry Potter.<br /><br />To begin with, in Rowling's fictional universe, good and evil are real forces in the world that exist in the choices people make---and the good can and do ultimately triumph.

But there is no moral clarity in Collins's world. Quite the contrary, she goes out of her way to insinuate moral equivalency between aggressors and their victims (especially those who try to defend themselves). I would say of Collins that pity for the guilty is treason to the innocent, but it's not even that she pities the guilty---she just doesn't believe that anyone is innocent. Actually, she thinks that everybody is rotten to the core, and the best we can hope to achieve is to mitigate our monstrous natures with occasional small acts of goodness. (But the less rotten someone is, the more he or she is doomed to victimization.) The only proper response to that is, she can speak for herself. She may hide behind a mask of humanism, but deep down Collins has the soul of a misanthrope. And the last couple of sentences and very brief epilogue of the novel don't alter the case---she doesn't even offer hope, but merely the vague suggestion of a hint of a possibility of a glimmer of hope, and even that much is unconvincing because it's impossible to integrate with everything that's come before.<br /><br />As to more specific moral content, both deal heavily with themes of race and class. For Rowling, prejudice based on either of these is caused by false ideas and is in turn a major cause of viciousness in the world, which must be fought and over which we can ultimately triumph. Collins, on the other hand, just takes for granted that racial (in her earlier series The Underland Chronicles) and class (in The Hunger Games) warfare are inevitable, and does not bother to examine the ideas behind them or even suggest that ideas *are* behind them. Race and class are just a fact of life: this is my tribe, and it is inevitably in conflict with your tribe, and they will probably always resort to violence to settle their differences (though it ultimately settles nothing, and she makes no distinction between the aggressors and those who only resort to physical force in self-defense against them).<br /><br />Even their styles are diametrically opposed.

B003YUC2FE|1.0|Of course the movies are great!  That's why you're here looking at this, because you've already seen the movies and know how wonderful they are.  Now that we've established that, go buy the movies individually.  I can't even begin to describe how bad the packaging is.  The packaging is hard to store, hard to get movies out of, and hard to put them in.  It's just 10 slots cut into some foam, so you don't know what disk is what without handling them all.  They are a pain to put back into the case because of the way the foam is cut.  And, to those that want to keep your disks in good condition for years of watching pleasure, you can't remove the disks without handling the face of them, so they will wind up with all sorts of fingerprints and skin oil on them.  I have many trilogies, collections, and sets of movies, on Blu-Ray and on DVD.  This is hands-down, by far, the worst packaging of them all.

1591396190|4.0|The FAST technique embraces different approaches based on whether your project is seeking incremental gain or requires real breakthrough. \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" promotes breakthrough thinking, justified by the higher profits such thinking generates among companies studied by its authors, Kim and Mauborgne.[1]<br /><br />The authors note the failures of companies over the past fifteen to twenty years--since the publishing of \\"In Search of Excellence\\" and \\"Built to Last\\"--including Atari, Data General, Fluor, and National Semiconductor.  The cornerstone of Blue Ocean Strategy is value innovation, defined as \\"the integrated and simultaneous pursuit of differentiation (ie, buyer value) AND low-cost (ie, supplier value).\\"<br /><br />Their analytical tool set begins with a strategy canvass that identifies the principle competitive and investment factors within your industry. With wine as an example (in brief), they might include price, distinction, marketing, aging, vineyard, complexity, and range. Their framework (called Four Actions) relies on facilitating consensual agreement around four questions. Participants' answers suggest a new value curve that might enable your company to shift from traditional industry factors to uncontested market space. The four questions are:<br />1. ELIMINATE--Which factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?<br />2. RAISE--Which factors should be raised well above the industry's standard?<br />3. CREATE--Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?<br />4. REDUCE--Which factors should be reduced well below the industry's standard?<br /><br />For example, they suggest the success of Cirque du Soleil (compared to a traditional circus) accelerated with the following insights:<br />1. ELIMINATE--Star performers, animal shows, etc.<br />2. RAISE--Unique venue, type of concession sales, etc.<br />3. CREATE--Theme, artistic music and dance, etc.<br />4. REDUCE--Multiple show arenas, thrill and danger, etc.<br /><br />Using the strategy canvass of Southwest Airlines they suggest the more factors of friendly service, speed, and frequent point-to-point departures. Both Cirque du Soleil and Southwest Airlines are viewed as sharing focus, divergence, and a compelling tagline. On the total, the authors' steps for visualizing strategy draw upon group discussions and consensus--aka, excellent facilitation. They also suggest the use of a Pioneer-Migrator-Settler perceptual map that would seem to offer far less benefit than seeking consensus with the Four Actions above.<br /><br />\\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" offers additional and valuable questions[2] that challenge each of a life-cycle's steps (eg, FAST's Plan-Acquire-Operate-Control) to find the biggest blocks faced by buyer drivers such as productivity, simplicity, convenience, risk, fun/ image, and environmental friendliness.<br /><br />The authors finish their discussion with four \\"organizational hurdles\\" including politics, motivation, resources, and groupthink (ie, \\"cognitive\\"). However, like many academics, they complete their otherwise valuable book by discussing the importance of converting the strategy into execution--missing the importance and significance of building consensual analysis to pave the way.

B004XVMCMQ|5.0|Complain, complain, complain:  Many people complain that this movie does NOT capture Fanny Price.  What they don't get is: this movie IN ALL WAYS captures Jane Austen at her acerbic best.  Rozema has given Fanny all the pointed commentary that in the book is voiced by Austen, in her role as narrator, or by another character ( \\"marriage is a maneuvering business\\", voiced in the movie by Fanny, in the book by Mary Crawford).  And Rozema has the religious background to depict Austen's attitudes towards adultery correctly:  AS A SIN.  AS AN EVIL. This is  made quite clear in the books last chapters, especially Edmund's description of his last interview with Mary Crawford.  Austen - and Edmund and  Fanny - do not share Mary Crawford's  more contemporary, modern attitude - that this may be folly, but it is not 'evil'.  While the slavery issue is not as explicit in Austen, political events never are, but they always form a background.  The 'Militia' in P&P, the 'Naval Officers' in Persuasion.  Here we have slavery obliquely mentioned in the text, Antigua explicitly mentioned.  It was widely known that Antigua grew sugar cane with slave labor, exported refined sugar to England. Indeed, there was no other industry.  Her brother, Frank, in the Navy, visited Antigua and deplored the conditions of the slaves in 1806, her father George Austen acted as a trustee for an estate ( a sugar plantation) in Antigua ( he was deceased at the time the book was written in 1813), the first slave revolt in Santa Domingo was in 1801, and in 1807 the British Parliament made trading in slaves a FELONY for any British subject, anywhere in the world.  While Rozema has expanded this storyline, it is inaccurate to whine that slavery is not mentioned in the text:  The only way you can get there is read the book with your eyes closed and in ignorance of a dozen years of crucial British history.  Finally, the performances in this movie are stunning:  Francis O'Connor as Fanny!!  Harold Pinter as Sir Thomas.  Embeth Davidtz, etc. etc.  Extremely strong cast.  Well Done.  THE MOST AUSTEN OF ALL THE MOVIES!!!!

0345444051|3.0|This story is a science fiction classic mixed with a bit of new age mysticism though it doesn't delve deep into the latter but it obviously plays a huge role in the overall theme. It redefines the classic demonic entities as other world evolved beings temporary superior to man but stuck in their evolutionary state, whereas man towards the end evolves beyond them. It covers a lot of ground chronologically in a superb style which flows quite nicely demonstrating his excellent ability to also write short-stories. He obviously is a very talented writer and if you subscribe to the stories worldview, you will not doubt love the book.
B0059XTUXQ|3.0|The Iron Lady, directed by Phyllida Lloyd with a screenplay by Abi Morgan, is something of a mixed bag. On the plus side - and it's a considerable plus - it has bravura performances by Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher and by Jim Broadbent as her husband, Denis. The best parts of the film are when they are on screen together, for those are the times when Streep best brings out Thatcher as something more than her political persona, an image which the film, to its credit, does show as something Thatcher consciously groomed and developed.  And as she so often does, Streep has managed a performance in which she has so deeply immersed herself into the person she's portraying, taking on her accent, her facial expressions, her way of speaking, the actress is nowhere in evidence - it's Thatcher you see and hear on the screen.<br /><br />That said, however, the film itself is unfortunately something of an incoherent jumble, at least to an American viewer. Much too much of it consists of snapshot episodes and scenes presented with no framing context, a problem made more complicated by the way in which it jumps back and forth in time. It will be interesting to see what British viewers, who are far more likely to have the intimate familiarity with the historical periods and events covered, think of the film. For anyone else however, Thatcher's speeches and actions exist largely in a vacuum, with little to show or explain what she was doing, why she was doing it, and how it fit into the political narrative of the time.  We're shown piles of garbage being left outside 10 Downing Street but nothing about the garbagemen's strike or any of the other strikes going on at the time.  We're shown crowds of protestors shouting at Thatcher but nothing about the closing of plants and coal mines or cuts in services behind the protests, let alone _why_ they were taking place.  We're shown her as Prime Minister during the Falkland Islands War (for about ten minutes) but nothing about what the war was about.  We're shown Thatcher facing being deposed as Prime Minister but nothing about why she'd fallen out of favor in her own party beyond being bullying and abrasive.  One gets the feeling of being rushed through a museum of Thatcher's life but not being allowed enough time to learn anything about any of the exhibits: \\"Just time for a quick look\\" and then it's \\"Move along, move along\\".<br /><br />This lack of context is also felt in the way that most of the other characters in the film, particularly Thatcher's political cohorts and opponents, are never really developed individually, largely serving as a kind of harumphing background chorus and leaving Streep's Thatcher to exist in even more of a vacuum. A few exceptions are worth mentioning however. Harry Lloyd is quite engaging as the young Denis Thatcher who wins a young Margaret (Alexandra Roach) by alternately being supportive and doing little comic turns to make her laugh when he knows she's in need of one. And Anthony Head (yes, the one from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) does a sympathetic job as Thatcher's long time (and eventually long suffering) political ally, Geoffrey Howe. But beyond these limited contributions, it's really left to Streep and Broadbent to carry things along. And when they're on screen together, it works. When they're not, things feel stilted and set-pieced.<br /><br />Another problem is that Lloyd and Morgan don't seem to have had a clear idea as to just what kind of film they were wanting to make. One gets the feeling that they bit off far more than could be reasonably digested but were unwilling or unable to pare it all down, with the result of reducing Thatcher's life to a series of disjointed snippets, far too many of which were set pieces. No individual part is really bad, and one could see that there were easily three or four different films that they could have made that would have been far more engaging and given a clearer picture of the subject and the period. They could have made an entire film about Thatcher in her declining years, her mind fading, talking to her dead husband, Denis.  These scenes, between Streep and Broadbent, were by far the best and most touching parts of the film they did make.  They could have made a film devoted to her rise to power, or of her transformative years as Prime Minister, or of the period of the Falkland Islands War by itself. But in trying to jam it all into a single film, they have created a film of much flash but little substance.  This could be a result of both the director and writer's relative inexperience in the medium:  Lloyd as director (mostly a stage director, her only credit as a director of a feature film was Mama Mia!, in which Streep also appeared) and Morgan as writer (mostly a writer for television, though she did also write the screenplay for Shame, her only other feature film work).  But whatever the reason, The Iron Lady as a film neither flows nor does it paint a coherent picture, not of its subject and not of the times she lived in.<br /><br />One particular annoyance I had with the film is that it implies that Thatcher was virtually the only female member of parliament when she was first elected in 1959. In fact, you never, ever, see any other female MP's at any point in the film, in spite of the fact that by 1959 there had been female MP's for forty years and that in the 1959 election there were 25 female MP's elected, 12 for Thatcher's Conservative party and 13 for the Labor party. Granted, in 1959 women still only made up 4 percent of the House of Commons in total, but nonetheless Thatcher was far from being the only one.<br /><br />Another annoyance was in their ignoring the \\"Iron Lady\\"'s other nickname - \\"Snatcher Thatcher\\" - and why she was given that particular sobriquet.  They attempt to show Thatcher as being controversial but without any real background as to why - rather a large omission to swallow given that Thatcher was as deeply hated by one half of the UK as she was admired by the other.<br /><br />Recommended for Streep and Broadbent's sterling performances, but as a film, less breadth would definitely have been more depth. -- Whitt PondThatcher in her declining years, her mind fading, talking to her dead husband, Denis.  These scenes, between Streep and Broadbent, were by far the best and most touching parts of the film they did make.  They could have made a film devoted to her rise to power, or of her transformative years as Prime Minister, or of the period of the Falkland Islands War by itself. But in trying to jam it all into a single film, they have created a film of much flash but little substance.  This could be a result of both the director and writer's relative inexperience in the medium:  Lloyd as director (mostly a stage director, her only credit as a director of a feature film was Mama Mia!, in which Streep also appeared) and Morgan as writer (mostly a writer for television, though she did also write the screenplay for Shame, her only other feature film work).  But whatever the reason, The Iron Lady as a film neither flows nor does it paint a coherent picture, not of its subject and not of the times she lived in.  One particular annoyance I had with the film is that it implies that Thatcher was virtually the only female member of parliament when she was first elected in 1959. In fact, you never, ever, see any other female MP's at any point in the film, in spite of the fact that by 1959 there had been female MP's for forty years and that in the 1959 election there were 25 female MP's elected, 12 for Thatcher's Conservative party and 13 for the Labor party.

006112429X|5.0|This book does not leave you alone.  It crawls into your head and takes you places you don't expect.  Immediately you know things will not turn out well, what you don't know is how painful the road will be for the reader.  The characters defy stereotype.  The book revolves around Eva, an intelligent woman who happens to have given birth to son who loves nothing.  Her husband is unable or unwilling to grasp the malicious intent of his son Kevin.  He avoids dealing with the obvious and pushes his once adored wife into a role of distrustful angry mom.  She struggles to find clues that might have contributed to her son's lack of connection with anything.  He amazes her with his intelligence and sometimes sublime observations but understands they are always meant to connect in pain or humiliation.<br />What makes this book so readable is that there is a truth in Eva's observations and confessions  unflattering as they are yet they never touch on histrionic or superfluous ...their exact nature make you twist inside.  Although Kevin's character shows little if anything redeemable the few or one time the author does will make you hurt too much.  The touch or smidge of childlike behavior that Kevin by accident exhibits takes you to another level.  I found myself breathing hard during certain episodes in the book wanting them to hurry up and get over with it...a train wreck in the headlights only to find myself stung from something unseen.  This book is extraordinary.  You won't let go of the characters for a long long time if ever.  It is the opposite of contrived.  I didn't know I could feel this much while reading a book.  The emotions that burst were anything but fictitious.
B004VD3YIM|1.0|I bought this camera [...]. Based on the reviews, different brands/models are shipped to different people, and the one I got has absolutely no brand or model markings anywhere on the camera, included CD (and software on CD), or box. No instructions either. Using the Android app, IP Cam Viewer (a competitor for tinyCam Monitor), the camera brand and model came up automatically as \\"Unknown Brand\\", \\"IPCAM1,IPCAM2\\". Everything works perfectly in that app, connected on first try and hasn't had any problems since. I bought tinyCam Monitor Pro, since there was no way to actually try it out (the \\"test drive\\" amazon thing isn't going to work for actually seeing if the app will connect to a networked camera.... or at least, it wouldn't connect to mine), and I wanted to use the additional motion detection and recording features not found in IP Cam Viewer. However, I can't connect to the camera, I'm assuming since there is no comparable setting to the \\"Unknown Brand\\" option in IP Cam Viewer, and the app doesn't know how to communicate with it. Everything else is set the same as it is in IP Cam Viewer... same address, port, etc. I've tried all the camera brands/models that I've seen mentioned in the reviews for my camera, but I keep getting \\"Video Failed (socket closed)\\" and \\"Video Failed (404 - not found)\\" errors. So weak.

B0061S073A|5.0|This app has been great to 'safely' let my 3 year old 'play' with my kindle. I have some kid's drawing and game apps in here, and I know after I turn it on, there is no way she can accidentally erase or purchase anything, because she is limited to what I put in 'Kid's Place.' Very easy to use, too.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Graphics are good. Easy to learn controls and no problems with losing connection. Ads pop up but you can easily skip them and mod on to next game. Play this app all the time.
B002I0J5FG|3.0|First off I played right through ICO in one day the first time I played it many years ago. I thought it was fabulous. However, the gaming landscape has changed a lot since then. I don't expect the graphics to be any better than they are presented now, but I did expect them to improve the controls and save game choices. This Japanese game design style of punishing players for not perfecting controls and experimenting with various approaches by having players repeat things nonsensically over and over again is quite painful. This is the reason why Western game designers are making much more money hand over fist in their games. In fact, this grueling methodology very much takes away from the experience of what otherwise could be considered a masterpiece. If you are going to charge players $40 today for a set of games made many years ago then refresh it with more modern controls and save-game schemes. Don't just improve the graphics.
B006IGZWB2|1.0|This movie must have been made for the acidic Chardonnay sipping crowd with that lifelong dream of acceptance into their local Bridge club. It's a movie about nothing more than the day to day existence of some white women and their black maids. How creative, and so what's the point.
0439023521|5.0|My friend insisted, urged and basically pressured me into reading this book -<br />honestly, I am glad she did, I read the first 9 chapters in one sitting, I didn't want to put the book down because I didn't want it to end. I wanted to keep going and I wanted to know more and what was going to happen next.<br /><br />I finished the book over the next two days (because I had to work. It took me so long)<br />this book. To call it 'amazing' is an understatement, the entire idea of Panem amazed me, the thought of people having to compete in these brutal 'Hunger Games' events stunned me. I have now purchased \\"Catching Fire\\" and honestly I cannot wait to read it, I am now re-reading 'The Hunger Games' while I await for \\"Catching Fire.\\"<br />Suzanne Collins has created something indescribable, this book, like I said before, stunned me. I am hooked, the story is written through the eyes of the main character, Katniss Everdeen (the name DOES grow on you)<br />throughout the book you know what is she is doing 24/7. You feel the anger, the rage, the loneliness and abandonment, the dreading fear and the uncertainty. When I reached the final chapters I even felt a little unhinged being inside of her head for so long and then being thrown back into civilization as she was.<br /><br />I am thankful my friend recommended this book to me and now I even find myself talking about it non-stop and trying to get more of my friends into this amazing story. I am hungry for more of 'The Hunger Games' and I cannot wait to complete the trilogy.

160094048X|5.0|I bought this book around Christmas and finally got around to some baking, starting with the Cherry Almond cookies.  Oh my, these were soooo good...they remind me of the Italian almond cookies my mom used to make, but better (sorry mom).  The cherry-almond combination is so yummy, and they are beautiful little cookies too!  I have most every book by these ladies, and I love that so much of their personalities are reflected in their books.  Beautifully written, beautifully photographed, amazing cookies!

0143119788|2.0|The title of the book was something I kept repeating to myself while reading the book. Because day after day, we live in a society where if we didn't like something, we apparently don't \\"get it\\", or we need to go back to Transformers or something.<br /><br />I'm glad to see I'm not the only one here who can't understand all the positive reviews this book gets. I am typically a patient reader and I try my hardest to go into a book with an open mind, but m not sure if I'm the right reader for Le Carr&eacute;'s books. Maybe it's my own fault for choosing this book before any of his others, but throughout the book, I kept waiting for something of actual interest to begin.<br /><br />I'll admit- a book doesn't have to be particularly \\"good\\" for me to enjoy it. Like, it doesn't have to be Stokeresque or Dickensesque, but it at least has to hold my interest with the characters or the turn of events. Or, like I mentioned in my Wicked review, If I'm hooked by chapter 3, I can continue reading. Now I'll admit, I liked Le Carr&eacute;'s writing. It got me hooked and I loved how he was setting the bleak, dreary tone of cold war era London.<br /><br />Problem is, you can only write so beautifully without even bothering to make us care for the characters and make the plot coherent for so long. Sometimes, pretty writing just isn't enough.<br /><br />I'm about 3/4 of the way through the book, and I can't tell for the life of me what the HELL is going on, who is who, or furthermore, if I should even give a flying rat's arse. There's somewhat of a story surrounding an organization named \\"The circus\\". Whenever we were on another subplot, I was begging for Le Carre to go back to it.<br /><br />The characters are BORING. Smiley could be a great character but there isn't enough development and we barely know anything about him. I honesty can't remember half the characters either since so many of them are brought in then suddenly left to die.<br /><br />But, the writing is pretty, did I get t that part yet? Oh wait, I have.

B003Y5H57E|4.0|Tale of a husband (Steve Carrel) who seems to lose his wife (Julianna Moore) to another man, moves out and realizes he has absolutely no game with women and a lot of bitterness. Enter a player (played by Ryan Gosling of THE NOTEBOOK) at a club the husband attends who takes pity on him and teaches him how to get it on with attractive women. There are clearly some good laughs in this film but it has a lot to say about not only gender roles but also how the genders treat each other in the courtship/mating phases. There's clearly a theme running through this film that the man has to toil to make the woman happy and that sometimes he'll be happy as well and other times he will not. It would also seem that if a single man cheats with a married woman that it's okay to punch said single guy but not the married woman who had a vow going yet she's a woman so you can't do that. A true love theme also permeates the movie but what puts this film up a few notches in comparison to other romantic comedies are the overlapping subplots. The player falls in love near the end of the picture, the 13 year old son is already in love with the babysitter but she loves somebody else and, well, you get the idea. Women will love the \\"dance\\" scene with Gosling and Stone. Supporing roles by Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, Emma Stone and John Carroll Lynch (Norm from FARGO).  The ending sort of dumbed itself down to what people wanted to hear and detracted from some of the unanswered questions of love and how it sometimes makes us do stupid things and also how people who love each other in a marriage don't always work things out. Anyway, the sappy ending detracted from the overall tale and sold out. If not for that the story part of the film would have been higher. The budget for this film was roughly $50M and it made over $142M at the Box Office.  STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; HUMOR: B to B plus;  LOVE THEMES/GENDER ROLE DISCUSSION POTENTIAL: B to B plus;  WHEN WATCHED: 2 daysgo; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; BEST DIALOGUE: Jacob: The skin under your eyes is starting to look like Hugh Hefner's b**l sack.

B003Y5H4Y8|3.0|Based on a 2007 Israeli film of the same name. This tale is told back and forth between current times and the 60s in East Berlin as three Mossad agents attempt to abduct a Nazi doctor who experimented cruelly on Jews in the camps. While the tale is certainly about the setup in abducting said criminal there's a lot of focus on the relationship between the three agents. Notable performances by Sam Worthington, Helen Mirren, Ciaran Hinds and Tom Wilkinson. I found the 60s scenes more interesting than those of its contemporary. Overall, a solid, good film but not great nor superb.  Some scenes require close watching or you will miss vital story points. This film had a budget of $20M and made a bit over $45M. STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B; WHEN WATCHED: end of January 2012.

B000002O3I|5.0|years ago when the Stones made their first TV appearance on BBC, they asked the BBC if they would also invite Howlin Wolf because they owed a huge debt of gratitude to him for showing the way. More than likely why \\"Little Red Rooster\\" was one of their earliest recordings. You get to hear that and a whole bunch more, including the Howlin's music on the Viagra Ad you may have heard lately. Two great LPs on one CD, a heck of a deal
B004LUS390|4.0|Before the update this app worked great on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />However, after updating it the application closes before you can even draw anything.

Great application for drawing on the go.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Simply put, Femme Fatale is the best dance/pop album I have ever heard. Coming from an over-50 person, that is quite a claim. I am not a Britney fan at all and will never buy her previous albums. But this collection has a special magic that I have not heard in pop music in years. It's indeed quirky and clever, but most of all it's melodic and complex. It certainly has its autotune effects, but it actually helped smooth her sometimes affected delivery. I have been playing Femme regularly for almost a year and am still dissecting harmonies hidden in its delicious chord progressions. \\"Inside Out\\" may be the best single of the lot. But don't skip over anything, they all work beautifully together. Britney really worked hard to make this her statement, and it shows. And to her credit, her singing is far better here then on previous albums... she's lighter, spacial and less groan-y.<br /><br />Don't be afraid to listen, you may love it as much as I did.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this oz a huge variety<br /><br />t<br /><br />This is a huge variety of mini-games that are easy to learn and quick to play if you only have a few minutes to kill.

I recommend this to anyone that enjoys fun, quick and easy to learn games.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are dumb or have boof instructions, but otherwise it isn't too shabby. worth being a free game

1416549447|1.0|Listened to this on audiobook, and I feel like the whole thing could have been done in an hour.  He repeats the same phrases over and over, and makes unnecessary belabored examples, as if trying to make the book as cliche as possible...Body, mind, spirit, balance, chi, energy, core...it sounds as if its designed to be an infomercial.    Maybe this book is intended for new runners, but as a runner for over 30 years, it annoyed me to no end.  Others have commented on this hypermarketing too. His advertisements for chi walking and chi living underscore his goal to make a brand. He uses the phrase \\"Chi running\\" at least 30 times in the first audiobook section, a phrase which essentially didnt exist until he created it, with no explaination of what it actually is until later. Long term runners beware.
B006WWNUFC|5.0|Its wonderful to see a show into it's 7th season stay interesting. The writing is still fantastic, the cases are always interesting, and the interpersonal relationships are realistic. I love that the new parents are shown actually having baby-related problems; you dont see parenthood, or pregnancy for that matter, portrayed honestly very often. Congratulations over all for continuing to give us a show we can actually feel smarter after watching, a rarity in today's reality show fueled media.  As to the series premeire of Finder, it's not a bad spin off. Those who remember this character will recall he isn't \\"superhero\\" by any means, but instead suffered a brain injury in combat which causes him both to compulsively find things, and also to see connections where most would see chaos. As to the question of support.... was it missed that people generally pay quite handsomely for objects to be found? He made more finding one guitar than most Americans do in 6 months; I'd call that ample support. The writing isnt as good but so far it is fair, we'll have to see as the season goes on whether or not the characters fully develope. A promising start for a spin-off show though.

B004469BQA|2.0|I have been a Satriani fan for over 20 years and love all of his work. But i have to say this did dissapoint me some. I feel the songs lack originality and depth. I tend to wonder if he was trying to complete to many tasks at once when writing these songs. But the real problem with this cd is the keyboardist. Now i know Satch has earned the right to do whatever he wants at this point in his career but please Joe dont ever have that guy on another cd!!!!!!! Please!!!! There are a few songs on this cd that would have been great if they were not ruined by that guy.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|I got the Perplexus Epic as a christmas present and can't leave it alone! I am a puzzle lover and am very pleased with this tricky little toy. A lot of reviews say that it breaks often, but I have dropped mine several times and bring it to a lot of places and it's still going strong. it's a great puzzle to bring anywhere, and fun to fiddle with at home. I like how it has multiple checkpoints so you can start on a different one of you get frustrated. Whoever created this thing is a genius, and I have had endless hours of fun. Just a warning though, this thing is not for the short -tempered, because it requires A LOT of patience. I recommend this to anyone who loves puzzles!

B006PAZMMK|5.0|Amazing, amazing music, and music it is. I've heard many people dismiss dubstep as simply noise and not true music. Skrillex has already discredited that argument with his last showing, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. But now he goes and makes those people look like fools with this one.  First of all, if you're not a fan of this kind of music, watch out, because you may be converted...  Every track offers a different trip, each distinct and beautiful in its own way. Sure, by nature dubstep will assault your ears with a barrage of hard-hitting drums, sweet, melodic vocals and insane, soul-bending beats. Great for jogging,lifting weights, creating offspring or whatever it is you happen to be doing. It's treat after treat after treat. Near the end, the final two tracks are like nothing I've heard from this genre. I was in the bathtub when the Skrillex Orchestral Suite came on, and I straight up had a catharsis. The most epic bath I've ever taken. Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites was rendered in orchestral form complete with a choir, and suddenly life made sense and I was at one with the universe.  Surely your experience will differ from mine, but if you love or even just like this sort of amazing music, then your life might just make a little more sense with this album. Just buy it. Seriously.

B00511ONPG|5.0|I received this book as a freebie for attending a social media seminar at which Dave Kerpen (the author) was one of the speakers. I was happily surprised by the thoughtful and strategic nature of the book.<br /><br />This is not a book for people who want to learn how to set up a Facebook page or create a Twitter account. Rather, it is a book on good (or likeable) business practices and how to translate these onto the major social media platforms (especially Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn).<br /><br />The book starts off with an important concept which is to *listen* to your customers and prospects before you start talking. The book provides tools for how to do this. And once you start talking, that doesn't mean you should stop listening.<br /><br />Consumers post complaints and raving reviews on social media networks every minute of every day. You need to be listening to what people are saying about your products and services and respond. Not responding is way worse than responding with a \\"we're sorry you had that experience...\\" or whatever the problem is. Always follow up and make sure customers' problems get resolved. This can turn a vocal complainer into a vocal fan.<br /><br />The book also provides tips and lots of great examples for how to get customers to be engaged on your social media sites, how to leverage the unique \\"targetability\\" of social media marketing, and how to be a likeable company - in real life and online.<br /><br />Thumbs up, lots of stars, etc.

0439023521|5.0|I bought the Kindle version...and immediately after I was finished reading it, I HAD to go ahead and get the other two books in the series. I was completely drawn in by the story! LOVE IT!
B004XWLN20|4.0|It's the box set. Only complaint that I have about it is the discs could have been placed in the slots better. Maybe a different design would have been better.
0439023513|5.0|Many people dislike how this last book played out, but I was genuinely satisfied with the ending. A lot of reviewers seemed to hate the mentally unstable or cold side of the characters. I found that it made them seem more realistic. Sometimes the characters give up, sometimes they're distant, sometimes they're selfish, and always they are just not-so-perfect products of an exhausting war.  I love the way the book ended. It wasn't super romantic, but it left me with the feeling that all the characters are where they should be considering the circumstances they endured. I also like that there isn't a clear answer to why some of the them do the things they do. I think the ending lets you feel hope and happiness for the characters involved, even though life isn't perfect for them. To me, it seems like things are just about as great as they can be after the damaging effects of the war. Plus, I thought the epilogue was an excellent way to finish.  I was pleased with the whole series. Each book seemed to have something different to offer, and I loved them all!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|the drawing pad is a very good. thing it really helps me with art, and just stuff I can do for fun
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|a good app that lets you play a lot of levels to play. it is angry birds I have the t shirt. it is a cool game with levels.
B000244G36|5.0|I ordered this movie for my family and it arrived very quickly and was in great condition.  We have watched it many times in the last month and it is still working great
B005HSL626|5.0|because of when the adds pop up, there's no point of getting the paid version.  that would be a ripoff!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was all really fun. I thought for a free game you couldn't beat what they give u.a great selection and it was all really fun
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|who doesn't like angrybirds?but the paid version is better as it doesn't have all those annoying adds. blocking your shots!
B003UESJF6|5.0|Just love this animation!  The humor is great and my kids love it too! Received it quickly and in good shape!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This books seemed in intriguing so I sampled it on my Kindle Fire -I was hesitant at first because I saw a review indicating that the photographs were hard to see but I had no such problem-.  I did not know whether to expect a horror story, or a thriller, or fantasy or plain fiction, I read this book in 2 days; it was gripping.  This is not a very long story but it's highly entertaining and well-written.
B0007MAO0M|5.0|Another family favorite - right up there with Maverick.  Watched it more than once and our kids loved it as much as we did.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my nephews as they have seen this movie more than a couple dozen times but always seem to lose or scratch their most current copy so it was a replacement.  It's a very well made movie for kids and adults.  I should have gotten myself a copy to add to the collection.  It's such a good story.
0312641893|4.0|Linh Cinder is the best mechanic in New Beijing in the Asian Commonwealth. She is also a cyborg and therefore a second class citizen because she is less human, about 38% human, according to the tests. With a platinum and plastic heart that pumps quietly and efficiently and a cybernetic network and visual display that keep her cool, calm, and collected, she is a marvel of machinery. A few minor upgrades, like a brand new mechanical foot since she's outgrown the old one placed when she was a child, and she'd be perfect, just not human, as her guardian and adopted mother would have it.<br /><br />Her guardian was once the wife of a rich and powerful man who died of Letumosis, a contagion that began in the country and has worked its way into the confines of the city, and it is always fatal. Cinder's guardian blames her for infecting her adopted father and leaving them all destitute so that Cinder is the family's only source of income, and Cinder's guardian resents her for it.<br /><br />When the prince (incognito) comes to Cinder's stall on market day to have a teaching robot fixed, she is surprised and her system warns her that she was in danger of sensory overload. The prince wants his robot fixed before the festival and Cinder agrees to give it a go, while concealing she is a cyborg, thus changing their lives forever and setting the ground rules for Meyer's re-imagined fairy tale.<br /><br />In remodeling the fairy tale of Cinderella, Marissa Meyer throws out most of the conventions and strikes out into brand new territory, retaining a few of the traditional elements to give the story a magical feel. There is more science in Cinder than magic, but that shouldn't deter die-hard fairy tale fans. There is enough of the fairy tale to maintain the fantasy.<br /><br />From the beginning, Meyer lets you know what is about to happen, leaving not so subtle clues and repeating them from time to time. From the first mention of the lunar princess who has been missing for more than a decade, it's obvious who she will turn out to be -- Cinderella, or in this case, Cinder. Meyer leans pretty hard on the \\"I'm not good enough because I'm a cyborg\\" element, but it's not always unpleasant and anchors Cinder within the story's emotion and social framework.<br /><br />While Cinder isn't a classical fairy tale, it is still fairy tale enough with queens from the moon with the power to glamour entire populations and turning their emotions from hate and disgust to love and adoration. The fairy godmother may be a lunar scientist on the run from the current regime and not using his glamour gift, but he is certainly a fun and fascinating addition to the tale.<br /><br />When a dirty Cinder limping on a poorly fitting mechanical foot in a discarded dress shows up at the ball, the ending to the night is in the bag -- or is it?<br /><br />Marissa Meyer throws a few curves in Cinder and they enhance the story: missing lunar princess, a cyborg Cinderella with no feminine wiles, an evil queen with the power to glamour everyone, and a power struggle between Earth and the Moon for starters. The biggest drawback is knowing the book is part of a trilogy and it will take a while before Cinder finds her happily ever after ending with the prince.<br /><br />Cinder is a welcome addition to re-imagined fairy tales with a style and shape all its own.urn out to be -- Cinderella, or in this case, Cinder.

098478280X|5.0|I am a junior college student from a very very small liberal arts college. None of the CS students in my college has got offer from those top tech companies in the pervious years.<br /><br />With the guidance of this book and the Google Resume, I successfully scored interviews from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Twitter and Zynga. Then by practicing the problems from this book carefully for a few times, plus the problems on careercup.com, I was able to do very well in some of those interviews, and eventually got offers from two of those companies.<br /><br />So for those of you who want to work at those companies as a SDE/SDET, don't hesitate to buy this book and use that website!
1451648537|4.0|Really cool book and very well written. I love the author's style and honesty. I have a new perspective on Steve Jobs. I didn't know he was such a pushy/demanding/jerk sometimes. I really lost some respect for him. No doubt he is an incredible driver of innovation and perfection though. That is clear from the book. I just wouldn't want to work with him.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I bought this for my musical-rabid niece. This product was exactly what it stated it would be. Quick ship, perfect! It is longer than i remember.
0393338398|3.0|Very good book. I love Michael Lewis. My only complaint is that it was a little more long (and in-depth) than I would have liked. I started losing interest. Overall though good book and good movie.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I have thought about writing reviews for books before, but never seemed to get started.... So, what is it about Thea Harrison's Wyr, the characters of the Elder Races books that got me there? I fell in love. Dragon Bound took me for a wonderful ride-- although when it came to Dragos, the heroic dragon-shifter in this story, at first I wasn't sure I would take the leap... But, before I finished the first half of the book, he had won me over-- along with his mate, Pia, and all the other wonderful/terrible, powerful freaky and awesome characters and scenarios. Before I finished this book, I bought the next one, and before I finished that one, I bought the next one.  Dragos is saturated with power and arrogance. As old as time and bored in ways that could only happen to someone who has lived for millennia, he is startled out of his complacency by Pia, a half-Wyr who has the audacity-- and the ability (!) to steal from his hoard. Pia is somewhat oblivious to her own gifts, and totally unaware of the extent of her own Power. I loved Pia first, then, when Dragos fell for Pia-- well, there I went, over the edge of the cliff and into the sky.
0439023521|4.0|My wife and I both read this book in about a day. And then we had to go out and buy the next two immidiatly. It is a fun story and fast-paced. Easy to read. Highly reccomended.
055357342X|5.0|This book is so good, you will be exhausted and in awe and feeling like you had the greatest sex ever and in much need of a cigarette...this books just grips you and the hits just kept coming it seems....especially that wedding, I could barely gasp for air at that point.  I would not read as a stand alone...the reason I was so blown away is because of the background I felt having read the previous books...easily my fabv in the series...  Have mercy.  Read it!

0240815807|5.0|I love all the little tricks in this book (like for example doubling a track in mirroring the EQ). I read it every day at lunch and always pick up a useful tidbit to try out. He spends a lot of time on studio monitors and unfortunately I don't have any at the moment but in the same chapter(s) he also covers room acoustics and monitoring on various other sound systems (boombox, cheap PC speakers, etc) so at least I have an idea if I'm getting a honest interpretation of a mix.
0857680986|5.0|No complaints. The book arrived well packaged and earlier than expected considering it was the holidays.  I definitely recommend artists interested in this book to buy it from here as it was the most cost effective.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I can't help but notice that virtually all of the 1 star reviews I read here on Amazon for this movie are by non-Christian people who are either hostile to Christianity or resent the fact that Sony Pictures does not call out the fact that this is a movie with a Christian message. While I understand these complaints I have to disagree with the juvenile attacks against the story and acting in this movie. The story is just as good if not better than any secular movie I've seen come out of Hollywood in recent years. The performances in this movie are absolutely remarkable given the fact that the actors are not professionals. I saw no cheesy performances, no hams. Just because we don't see George Clooney or Matt Damon or Ryan Reynolds or whoever in this movie does NOT mean that the actors here are inadequate or poor. I can't help but think that the anti-Christian nature of many of the negative reviews gives away a bias that criticizes the story as cheesy and the actors as bad, not because this is true, but because these people just don't like Christians or Christianity. If the Christian message was removed from this movie and it featured an ensemble of well known Hollywood types, I'm sure the reviews from the Christianity-bashers would have been much different. Or if the movie had an anti-Christian message (as many movies out of Hollywood do nowadays) I'm sure these people would applaud it.<br /><br />Having said this, I highly recommend this excellent movie. The message of this movie is inspiring, life-affirming and heartwarming WITHOUT being cliched or cheesy. But if you hate Christianity and can't handle the Christian message being presented in a realistic and positive way and would just be insulted and put out by it, don't watch it because the Gospel of Jesus Christ is foolishness and an offense to those of you who are perishing and already dead in your sins.
B005ETA5K2|4.0|I bought this to improve my internet reception while vacationing in RV park.  The park provides wireless internet access but the strength of the signal is about half of the signal I receive at home. Many times marginal at best but much improved over last year. Still not enough to use Magicjack. My concern, which I read on the internet, that the antenna would cause my built-in wireless would be deactivated. I installed the software as per the directions. When the internet came up, there were two internet connections (the external antenna and the computer internal) and both had a connection. The bars on the internal showed two bars and the external shows five bars. The speed and reliability has increased greatly. The external antenna software software shows the signal strength and quality. Plus it also shows many more connections. Even though it shows five bars, magicjack is still not usable. Don't know why. I have not been able to figure out the reason other than the quality and the number of people accessing the internet. Many are watching movies which eats bandwidth and that may be the reason.  In conclusion, I am very pleased and would recommend it if using the internet for other than magicjack or videos.

0439023513|4.0|While I value a difference of opinion, giving this book a 1 is absurd. Think lovers of literature: Would you have even picked up a book that was rated \\"I hate it?\\" Even an \\"I don't like it\\" review is really for a book that you pick up on a whim and discover right off that it's poorly put together.  Many of the reviewers in this category analyze it in such depth that they must have spent more time reviewing than reading.  No spoilers!  Yes the book is disjointed. Yes, there is not enough interplay between the characters, especially the 2 that really won over many of the romance-type folks. Yes there is a gratuitous feel to at least one of the major deaths. Even through all of this, there has to be a realization this series is very hard conclude, especially when your audience is rabid for a 3rd and final book. The spectacular, albeit too fantasy-laden, end to the 2nd book set a precedent that probably made it virtually impossible to follow and end in 1 book.  I think the 2nd book is still my favorite (definitely a \\"5\\"), and I think the first is much tighter but not quite as awesome as the 2nd (\\"4.5\\"). Nonetheless, I give Mockingjay 4 stars (really more of a 3.75 ;)  because it wasn't tight enough. I did like it enough to feel some welling from the ol' tear ducts when I finished the resolution. Maybe the people who invested what seems to be hours in reviewing this book as \\"bad\\" should just create a bootleg version(s) of their own?

B005RJ6AIK|5.0|We saw the movie, loved it, and decided the beautiful soundtrack was definitely a must-have.  The music is not necessarily well-known music, but is, instead, the type of music that makes you feel you could look out your window and see the Hawaiian landscape.  It just transports you to Hawaii with this gorgeous background music.  Loved it!
B006O5XYWG|3.0|It was almost a great movie if it werent for some boneheaded laziness when it came to the writing of certain cirumstances/scenes in the movie. When Franco's character steals the serum from the Genesis corp. he just sticks it in his pocket. Seriously? This is the cure for alzheimers, a multi-billion dollar medicine, and people can just walk in and out of that place with canisters in their pocket? And he can carry an ape out in a box. WTF!? Worse, these are untested chemicals on human beings, who Franco even says could be a virus, and he can just carry these out in his pocket! What kind of security is this? At least in Jurassic Park he had to create a fake security power reboot and hide the canisters in a fake shaving can. All Im saying is, a little bit more effort in the writing department would make the story a bit more believable. Not just stuffing canisters in your pocket! This isnt a pack of Juicy Fruit in a 7-eleven!  An ape, living in Franco's house, beats up and bites a neighbor, and authorities dont question him where he got an ape? Is that even legal? His employers don't here about Franco's ape attack? Funny how they were testing on apes, and now Franco has an ape, hmmm. Stealing property? FIRED! And they shoot elephants, crocs, etc that attack humans, I don't think Caesar would have been an exception. He woulda been put down. Again, lazy writing = unbelievable. Could have gone a different route to put Caesar in the animal shelter.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|I found this book riveting. The descriptions of life in North Korea really give you a feel for the place. Loudspeakers in every home and work place that cannot be shut off. Utterly ruthless leadership who is not in the least concerned by starving peasants and workers. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in life in a very different world than our own.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|I was hoping for 3 reasonable length stories but found that i read the entire book rather quickly. I love the Bosch stories but these were so short I could not really \\"get in to them\\". Not really worth the price!

B00000AOUD|5.0|Ian Anderson (mastermind and lead man of Jethro Tull), is the creator and master of his own genre of rock music most closely characterized as \\"english prog rock\\".  He does a great job here defining and even redefining that genre.  Classic album that should be in everyone's collection.  By the way, if you like this in the slightest, you MUST consider the 40th anniv. re-release of Aqualung - completely remixed and remastered.  Amazing work (the remix/master) and great stuff.  The bonus CD, not at all \\"B-side\\" material in the slightest, is worth the price of the full CD set by itself (for those who don't want to lay out the cash for the full collector's package, which, by the way, I now wish I had purchased - and might still)!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|If you like to keep track of your time, distance, speed/pace and heart rate, this watch is ideal.  The programability of this watch does NOT require the computer mind of a 20 year old (hey, I'm 55 and I could actually follow the instructions and set it all up rather easily!).  It will do so many usefull things like create up to three data fields which will scroll at the speed setting you desire.  These data fields will tell you in large readable numbers your distance, pace, speed, avg pace per mile, heart rate and much more depending on what you want.  You will love the Garmen ANT+ which sends your running data to their site where you can track everything you want about your run (including seeing the course via google sat). The site is quite useful and best of all, its FREE.  The GPS has been very accurate.  On a recent cloudy day it took a few minutes to start working but most times it connects in less than 30 seconds.  The watch is very comfortable and easy to use. You can tap the bevel to change data fields or use the scrolling setting at a scroll speed you set.  Just take the time to read the instructions and go through the guide.  I received this at Christmas and have been using it frequently with NO problems.  I love it and would strongly reccommend it to anyone who enjoys running and wishes to better track their results.
1582701709|5.0|This book couldn't have come at a better time in my life. When I first heard about \\"The Secret\\" I believed, but was in and out with dedicating myself to the daily routines suggested in the dvd and the book. I tried a little experiment; I wanted the book and I wanted it to be inexpensive- I thought about looking up the book on amazon and found it just perfectly UNDER the price I had expected! Though that may seem small to achieving goals from the law of attraction, many things have been affirmed and accepted since and before then. A happy enhancer, I call it.

B000000OF6|4.0|QUEEN-GREATEST HITS I & II: QUEEN...whose popularity has outlasted the untimely death of flamboyant belter FREDDIE MERCURY by a good two decades...mixed prog, crunching hard rock and classical studio-enhanced flourishes for a complex soundscape unlike any other seventies ensemble. BRIAN MAY's multi-tracked pyrotechnic axework, MERCURY's careening soul-daddy wail, and the boom-bastic rhythm section of JOHN DEACON and ROGER TAYLOR anchored a long string of radio epics including undisputed arena anthems BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY and WE WILL ROCK YOU. The sparse, funk infested ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST, CRAZY LITTLE THING CALLED LOVE's retro rockabilly vibe, and KILLER QUEEN's flashy glam blaze across disc one, while QUEEN's highly underrated eighties output is exposed via I WANT IT ALL, HEADLONG, and HAMMER TO FALL on the second CD. Somehow, the key cult classics KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE and TIE YOUR MOTHER DOWN missed the final cut, but GREATEST HITS I & II goes a long way towards encapsulating the bulk of classic QUEEN.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR KINGS

1597801585|5.0|I was so engrossed  with this bookthat I read it in 3 days. When Not reading, I couldnot stop thinking about it.Although I would have liked a foot note or dictionary for the Thai words, the sense of the word was discernible  or closely related to Japanese( Shogun)to provide an internal translation.  I felt the foreign words and the writing did contribute to the foreign ambience of the  book. Although there was a smatter of deja vu (ala Blade Runner), the Emiko character was fleshed out well.  Unfortunately, my 2 favorite characters were killed off, so to speak, but those deaths were pivotal to the rest of the story.  The title was a turnoff, bought the book  for the description.  At times was  a little difficult to take in the parallel events, time stamp would have been nice.  sounds like  a sequel in the works, I hope, and plan on reading other books by this talented author.

0374531269|4.0|Being a teenage boy is confusing enough. Being a teenage boy trying to find a safe place in a country full of turmoil? That was Ishmael's life in the 1990s. He lost many family and friends, got forced into becoming a soldier, and then had great difficulty achieving a mental recovery from the atrocities he witnessed. This book shows the conflict (and the rehab from the conflict) from the eyes of a young boy.<br /><br />As you read this book, you feel like Ishmael is right there telling you the play-by-play of his days during the civil war. He seems to be pretty honest in the memoir--he doesn't hold back the fact that his intentions weren't always good. For example, thinking about the innocent people he witnessed dying only made him shoot and kill people more when he was given the gun. Of course these are awful things to hear, but I'm glad to see a memoir where a person shows their good AND bad sides.<br /><br />It's a little hard to believe that he could remember all the details he included in this book, especially considering that he was drugged when he was a soldier. I was also surprised to see that most of the book did not deal with his actual time as a soldier, but what happened before and after that. But these are petty issues I have with the book. Overall I loved it and would recommend it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|awesome app lots of good games to play some of them are very challenging. some of them are very easy.
0060873027|3.0|I'm surprised at the harshness of some of the reviews.  Yes, the book ignores fundamental physics, but it does what Michael Crichton liked to do: Set up a fantastic situation that requires suspension of disbelief in order to give didactic lectures to the layman about science, morality, history and chaos.  The point of the book is to give readers an insight into a world normally beneath our notice.  In the meantime, you also learn a little about the machinations and motives of pharma companies and the politics of academia.

B006O5XYWG|5.0|Born in a research lab, raised by a suburban couple, and banished to an animal rescue ranch after he attacks a neighbor, a super-intelligent \\"alpha male\\" chimp leads fellow apes in a rebellion.<br /><br />The movie delivers what it says, I don't understand people that gave this flick 1 or 2 stars!<br /><br />Their main complaint was \\"it was boring\\" usually these kind of people have over stimulated digital brains, that must have some sort of graphic image constantly in their face to understand a plot.<br /><br />There are movies, much like this one that are filled with action, however the main body of the plot, and the way it's delivered to the viewer is through the complex method of \\"Acting\\", so if you can't sit still, watch, listen, and follow the story like it is told to the viewer, through the relationships of the actors, and their words then you will be lost, and bored, because this movie plot moves along through dialect, not images!<br /><br />I thought it was pretty neat how they worked some of the original content from the old movies into this one!<br />I read one review that said \\"it's just a bunch of apes getting back at humans\\" !<br />lol..WHAT A LAUGH! The apes that I saw were just your average everyday monkey's.<br />Like in real life, it was the apes that were being mistreated, and tested on, and in fact the main ape \\"Cesar\\" frowns on hurting any humans throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />If you like big action flicks, where the villains are \\"super killed\\" at the end of the movie then this may not be a movie for you, but if you like good acting,a good story, and have a good computer and viewer, then click on Rent!<br /><br />The movie delivers action, and an underlying plot of the demise of the human population in a way that is believable.<br /><br />WHAT i LIKED MOST ABOUT THIS MOVIE, IS THAT IT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A FAMILY FILM!<br />You may not want your 7 yr old to see it, but this would be a great movie for kids 12 and up, as there is little to no bloody death fights, or bad language,<br />The kind of movie a kid will remember, jut like the original POTA Movies!<br /><br />WHY WAIT...RENT NOW!ut like the original POTA Movies!  WHY WAIT...RENT NOW!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great and ability to set different challenges keeps it fresh. Would highly reccomend.  Like the option of turning sound off.
B006CBSE86|5.0|Nothing quite gets me worked up like the words \\"New Nightwish CD\\". I'm going to cut to the quick and not write a several page tour de force on this like I'm getting paid for it though. Over all I like the album though you can't approach it like a normal Nightwish piece, you have to remember this is a movie soundtrack, a concept album. There is a lot of experiment with tone, a little more in the way of pieces with no lyrics. Over all just a killer series of songs even if it gets a bit sticky here and there. The absolute best part of this album is that unless you are a complete prat this ends the Anette-Tarja debate forever. Anette's fully found her voice for Nightwish and while we're still not getting those insanely high notes, it's still something new and different it's fantastic in every sense of the word. Best track: I want my tears back: Great lyrics that I can't get out my head, heavy celtic influence with a hard biting metal edge perfect in every sense of the word. Worst track: Slow love, Slow: It's tacky to say that it was just too slow for me but it was, maybe in the film this is woven in to the narrative tightly and while it's still a great song this jerks me out of the album harder then a trapping on a aircraft carrier, just a hard sudden STOP. It's not enough to hurt the album in my mind but it was still kinda jarring.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I ordered this case along with my Kindle Fire, and I absolutly LOVE IT! Is was beyond easy to install/apply, and it hold the Kindle very snugly. It is very sturdy, and travels well in my purse. Highly Recomend!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love it! my boyfriend and I constantly compete when we can pry it away from his son! download it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I am amazed!!!The best movie I have ever seen.I laughed and cried through the entire movie.I can't believe how well done it was. It grabs your attention from the very beginning and keeps it through the whole movie.I can't say enough good things about this movie. I highly recommend it.
B005F82X48|5.0|I would like to start this review by saying I am not usually impressed with female singers. Not because I have anything against women, I just tend to prefer male singers. So, I was skeptical and a bit apprehensive about this album from the start, but they completely blew me away! They are awesome! They entire album is great from start to finish. Ariel nails the vocal parts and the musical accompaniment is the perfect blend of hard rock with pop-inspired hooks. Definitely one of my favorite albums of 2011 and worth every penny!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this game is ok but its pretty hard to get points without spending real money. it gets annoying after a while :/
B004LROUNG|2.0|I hadn't read a Grisham book in a while, probably won't read one again in a while either.  I guess I can admire to a degree his setting up a situation where - SPOILER - the protagonist literally cannot win the trial and then actually does not win the trial.  I admire the unconventional aspect of that in its story telling, but man, this book was just really boring.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are very fun and very addicting. some are difficult but they are still fun. its kinds like an arcade themed game.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I've never read a book like this one.  The writing itself didn't blow me away, but the imagination on display here was truly impressive and his characters were much more developed than those in typical 'cookie cutter' SF/fantasy.  I look forward to his future work, hopefully written inside of this world he has created.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it I have a great time because you get to play random games and each one is very fun
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the fishing game and the sumo wrestling game and the Flashing lights game.  but I like this game a lot
B004FOA84A|5.0|this is a really good mystery game. and very good on the kinlde fire! but it is a tad bit tricky I had to use the Internet tor some clues! but overall it is fun!
B000AGTPUK|5.0|It is quite the excursion to say the least, really an amazing movie and I usually don't like cartoon type movies. I really find most of them rather annoying to tell you the truth. I can recommend this movie to just about anyone of any age group and it won't annoy older adults like myself. That doesn't happen in too many a movie that appeals to all age groups. I especially liked the hobo that traveled on top of the train, of course some of the amazing ways the train traveled was fascinating.

030788743X|2.0|Before I begin, a confession: I'm a lifelong gamer, a huge pop culture nerd, and I've been wanting to read a good video game inspired novel for a long time.  This isn't that book.  \\"Ready: Player One\\" is, at its core, a treasure hunt.  The story follows Wade, a young man who is one of millions searching for a hidden Easter egg buried within a huge virtual world.  The virtual world, called OASIS, was designed by a brilliant recluse who was obsessed with geek culture and the 1980s.  As such, the book is crammed with references to popular music, vintage video games, films, anime and more.  And I do mean CRAMMED.  For the first few chapters, the references reinforce the story, helping create a framework to ground the narrative.  But very quickly, everything about this story gets buried under a constant stream of throwback references.  The novelty wears off very quickly, and it soon just becomes exhausting.  Beyond the sheer volume of the references, the constant callbacks to the 1980s create a bit of a problem.  The writing level isn't particularly bad, but it's more similar to that of a young adult writer like Rick Riordan or Judy Blume.  It's simplistic and inelegant, which quickly began to wear on me.  If it was a young adult novel, it would be acceptable.  But this is the writing of a book that is very clearly targeted on people years older than a young adult audience.  The dichotomy creates a inherent problem with \\"Ready Player One\\": The references are obscure and irrelevant for the audience the writing level is appropriate for, and the audience that would appreciate the 80s references will possibly find the writing laborious and oversimplified.  I like the story, and I like the characters.  But \\"Ready Player One\\" is nowhere near the book that it could have been.  Simply playing to a group's obsession with pop culture doesn't make a good book, and it doesn't excuse failures in writing.
B0067R0APK|4.0|This is easily the best weather app for the Fire. The interface still looks nice and it doesn't freak out over the lack of GPS.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app works well and provides all the functions of regular spider solitaire. If that's. what you want, this app is for you!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really love this app. it is so easy to use and allows me to be in the Word wherever there is wi-fi!
B005F96URI|4.0|I originally got this just because GACKT was in it. But really, all the leading roles are an amazing cast. Who'd waste time arguing that each of these actors haven't been great?! Well, anyone can say what they want, I guess. But truth be told, they made a quite enjoyable film out of what might have been less that that for me.  Sorry. I'm just not into the vengeance genre. (And this is obviously not the biggest budget film). But I thoroughly enjoyed the fantasy aspect about it. Very comic-book like. Very colorful. The fight scenes are obviously rehearsed and at times looks more like dancing or play fighting. For me, it's reminiscent of the Adam West Batman series hinted with bits of Sin City or something. But maybe that's just my oddball comparison.  Many of the costumes seem to be a spin off of Dick Tracy meets The Wiz. Not a bad thing. Just makes it a little more fantasy-like.  As for GACKT, Josh and Woody, they were without question the best actors in this film. Ultimately, they are the reason I keep watching again and again. They keep it interesting and will help to draw you in to the story a bit. At least, it's their characters that the the story follows most.  Even in the end, the characters backgrounds are still somewhat vague. It could be that it leaves it open for individual interpretation. But really, it's slightly unsettling to not have a more definite idea about the history of each character. As for Josh's character, I think it remains that his name is never even announced (hence, the 'nameless drifter'). Maybe it's supposed to add/keep the mystery?  The story itself is pretty good. At least, there IS a plot and a somewhat grand finale. Sometimes its a bit cheesy, repetitious or has way too much dialogue. (just like my review? haha) Not really gory, but there's bloody scenes that make me go 'dang!'  Overall, nice action film for movie night in with popcorn.
B0063IH60K|4.0|awesome!  cant believe this app is free!  free I tell you, free! really! one two three four five six seven eight
B0060ZJ78U|4.0|Brad Pitt's performance was not an Oscar winner but four stars is what I give this picture because of his supporting cast and the overall sentiments in this movie.  The suspense builds and the movie viewer is left with the question....why didn't he go for the money in the end?  Was he THAT attached to his team and weren't his kids old enough to move to another location.  I had no idea that statistics played such a big role in baseball picks or that salaries and managing players could be so complex, so it was an education.  I still go back to Tom Cruise and his \\"show me the money\\" line, a hard one to beat.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is great... I use it every morning to check the weather before I go to work... better then waiting for the news to tell me!

B0063GORYU|5.0|Addicting in the best way possible!!!  Always challenging, though difficulty varies from deal to deal.  Recommend playing single suit at least a few times to get the rhythm, then move on to two suits.  No doubt the complexity goes up as number of suits increases. Though I haven't tried three or four suits as yet, will definitely take the plunge in time!
B001N1DPDE|4.0|When I read that I would be impressed with the size of this knife, I was not ready for it when I actually held it.  It is really massive, but not too heavy.  I am one who has rather large hands and it was a comfortable fit.  I am anxious to put it through the paces, and feel it will perform well.  My only complaint so far is the sheath.<br /><br /> The release from the sheath is still stiff.  I have thought that removing it a few times would loosen that up, after 20-30 times, I have not felt any real difference.  I am hopeful that it will loosen up eventually.<br /><br />Update:I put the Micata handles on the knife, and it became better.  The sheath eventually loosened up.  My gripe, which is with most knives I have (but one) is the coating on the blade.  The coating is of a type that prents you from using a ferro rod, or mag strip.  you actually have to clean a portion off of it.  I have greatly thought of having the coating removed and simply gun blueing it.  I do have a knife from Habilis Bushtools, but that does not chop wood as good as the BK2.
0307959856|1.0|I am usually skeptical about prequels and sequels to classics but hoped that P. D. James might have achieved a higher standard.  Although the writing is elegant, the characters are flat, especially Elizabeth.  Marriage has done what I didn't think was possible in Elizabeth's and Darcy's cases: made them boring.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun but also challenging really really great!! hope.they come out with some more games! hate how you have to &quot;buy&quot; games
B005WMADYE|5.0|On the strength of an on-line review, I rented this on pay-for-view and was just blown away.  I don't need to repeat the other review accolades, but I can tell you this:  if you are an anime fan, just buy the DVD or BDVD for collection. You don't be disappointed by the high octane action or the brilliant technical work on the animation.  \\"Redline\\" is a new classic, raises the technical bar for animation and taking the art solidly into the 21st century .
B0064T6LV8|1.0|this game is the worst. don't buy. it sucks don't buy. it sucks don't buy is sucks don't buy sucks

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a very nice and entertaining game. It makes you think and plan and re-plan every step. If your new to this app try easier levels first and use each bird wisely. Aim for areas that will have more than one effect.. This game is also great for trips and long car rides it will keep you busy will making you think a little.
B006ZBRMOU|4.0|I was disappointed in this final addition to the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy. There was a lot of material but it felt repetitive and redundant. The exciting parts \\"non-sexual\\" were great but pathetically short. Out of all the sexy scenes, there was only one, maybe two that were original and exciting. This book felt like E.L. James was scrambling to tie together all the loose ends and wrap up the trilogy. Christian, compared to how he was in the first two books, felt cast in 2D. Most of the time he was sappy, clingy or pissed (And not the sexy intimidating pissed like we creamed over in the first two books). I don't mind the first two mentioned, except that was how he was most of the time. There were parts were we actually got to glimpse at his beautiful \\"lost boy\\", there were no parts where he showed his strength. That inner strength that makes all of us females swoon. We got plenty of it in the first two of the books and that is what made him so beloved. Pretty much we didn't get our fifty shades of Christian. In this book, Ana, being the one telling the story, was also in 2D compared on how she was cast in the first two books. She was either horny, sappy, or pissed. Her thought processes for most of the book were very repetitive. In all, The book was mostly sexual fillers. (which were repetitive, how can that happen!!!! James you can do better than that!) I have never gotten bored reading the steamy parts in novels, especially in the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy. As said before there were only two scenes that were, well, \\"Fifty\\" in the steamy scenes.And Ana's thought process fillers (I.e. \\"I love him so...My fifty shades...) I can't count how many times I read paragraphs that were the exact same but switched around so it wasn't word for word.  What I did love about the book is that through all mentioned above, I did get to see them move forward and Christians approach to heal. Those glimpses is what kept me reading. There was enough to keep me entertained. There was the onescene of his relapse in the RROP that floored me. It was wonderfully written and THERE I saw his fifty shades. I loved the malicious intents of the antagonist, Jack Hyde, though the scenes involving him were too short. The should have, in my opinion, made longer and deeper to the point where the reader is gripping their own butt for life. The essence was there, it just never made it. Also, *Spoiler* The orphanage scenario was cut way too short. It felt it was thrown in last minute to deepen the story. Revenge was good enough, in what happened to Jack in book two, but since them being in an orphanage for a couple months together (Jack and Christian)was put in, that should have been greatly elaborated. For lack of a better phrase, it was seriously half-assed. I loved the epilogue, who doesn't love a happy ending? The best part of this book was the bonus scenes added, the best being the one were we are brought back to the beginning of the story (Book 1) and got a glimpse of it in Christian's point of view and his first Christmas made my heart tear a little. It was in depth, heartbreaking, and actually seeing his fifty shades in only a few pages at the end in the bonus scenes made up for what book 3 lacked. I gave this book 4 stars instead of 3 partly because I love this trilogy, there were scenes in this book worth reading, and because of the bonus material. I just feel that James could have done a world better then this.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A pretty and contemplative game, well worth the dollar. Nice mood piece and I enjoy the music. nice choice for your app store, Amazon!

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I never use my marware case to stand the Fire, and I am not impressed with its ability as a stand. The flap should rest in an edge along the back, but it is tenuous at best. HOWEVER!!! It is a great protective case and well worth the money. I wholly recommend the case. If you need to stand it on a table, it will work, just don't jostle it.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Best deal out there for Apple owners. Comes brand new in Apple package. A little glitchy when loading netflix but once movie/show has started the glitching stops. MAKE SURE YOU ORDER A HDMI CABLE WITH THIS! Apple does not include that and it is required to use the adapter. I recommend the AmazonBasics HDMI cables because they are $40+ cheaper than any other brand for a nice cable. Over all I would recommend this adapter to anyone. Great for iPad, Netflix movies, YouTube, and iTunes Movies. This adapter is also nice because you can charge your ipod/ipad/iphone while using the adapter so it doesn't drain your battery.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|Perfectly executed puzzle and logic game. Easily worth your $.99. Gr8 graphics and lots of incredible. puzzles. You have. to. equick as well as thinking. Good game.

0393338827|5.0|Michael Lewis returns to Wall Street 20 years after publishing his first book \\"Liar's Poker\\" of his time as a trader, to find that the system hasn't changed and has gotten worse - that the traders now don't even understand the system. And instead of trying to understand it, they kept making bets which kept paying out until one day it didn't and the whole house of cards came crashing down in the crash of 2008.<br /><br />I've got to hand it to Lewis, he does a fine job of telling the story of how things got to be the way they were. The book ostensibly tells how a small group of traders managed to make millions off of the back of the crash that left millions homeless, jobless, and without any money to their name but it's also about how a handful of traders at these banks that caused the crash came away from the whole mess unscathed and able to keep their millions of ill-begotten loot. And still, it's also about how the banks that caused the crash were able to take in billions of taxpayer money in order to stay in business. So even though the individual stories of Steve Eisman and Michael Burry and the Cornwall Group are fascinating and you're rooting for them to beat the smug Wall Street banks, you know that those same villains they're going up against are going to take the hits and still come out smelling of roses.<br /><br />It's strange that Lewis thought that this book would have comedy in its story, when its entirely a tragedy and such a monumental event that its shaped the way the entire world economies work (he goes on to describe these in his follow up book \\"Boomerang\\", also highly recommended). When you read facts like fruit pickers in California with an annual income of $14k are able to get a loan to purchase a $750k home and can't make their first repayment, or the Las Vegas stripper who owned 5 houses, or the Jamaican nanny who owned 3 townhouses in Boston - and all of them of course lost the properties because they couldn't make the payments, it's not really funny, it's really sad. Because who in their right mind would make those loans in the first place?<br /><br />\\"The Big Short\\" is a fantastic book not least because of its subject matter but in the way Lewis writes it. He is a tremendous writer who can even make you understand some of the more complex and previously inscrutable ideas behind CDOs and how S&P and Moody's played a major part in the crash. It's a compelling read, well told, and is a fine book for anyone interested in discovering more about the financial collapse of 2008, it's causes, the main players, and the inevitable fallout. Highly recommended.ly sad.

B006MHWXMS|1.0|This app was a broken mess before the update. Maybe the update which has to uninstall the app completely, before it crashes and doesn't reinstall was the best feature?  Rebooted many times and it's stuck in its own Task and Todo world.

B0062NAVXA|5.0|My husband and I saw this movie twice in the theater and my copy just arrived TODAY on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I was so blown away after seeing this movie and I almost wanted to be allowed to sit in the theater to digest a little. There was humor, drama, grief, redemption, and rejoicing. The opening scene is enough to get your heart racing and tears flowing. I thought the acting was better than most crap coming out of Hollywood these days, and the story definitely had a better message than most crap coming out of Hollywood.<br /><br />This movie follows the lives of four cops living in Georgia and the ties that bind them together. It chronicles the most tragic thing that can happen to a parent and how one man finds strength in God to help him through it. But he also realizes that there is a lot he could be doing to be a better father and a better husband. He leads by example, showing his son what it means to be a man of faith and how to be a man of integrity. The movie beautifully weaves together everyday struggles we all deal with and shows us how giving our lives to God can help get us through even the worst of times. The ending will have you standing in your seat, cheering and clapping when Alex Kendrick gives his final message.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. Just make sure to stock up on tissues. You'll need them.

0937381888|5.0|I constantly find myself referencing this book. It is the homebrewing book that got me started, and it's served me for many years since.  Palmer is a great teacher and How to Brew is simply an indispensable resource for the homebrewer.  If you're waffling between buying How to Brew or The Complete Joy of Homebrewing, get How to Brew first. Papazian's book is very good too, but How to Brew is simply more useful in a permanent sense.

B005VTGB0S|4.0|I wanted to replace the [[ASIN:B00485F0M6 Speck Ipad Dust Cover]] that I have been using for my iPad (first generation). It's a good case, but a little too bulky and heavy. The Amazon Basics Leather Folio is just what I wanted. I can leave it in the case while I use it and is lighter and less bulky than the Speck. It provides adequate protection, front and back as well as sides, but the Speck would probably cushion the iPad better if your iPad were to fall out of a third story window, for instance.<br /><br />The iPad (first generation) fits snugly in the case, which makes me wonder if the more slender iPad 2 might not be a little too loose. Elastic bands secure each of the corners, and in this kind of cover, if they don't fit right, the device is always slipping out. The cover I use for my Kindle Fire does this and it's a nuisance, so I would not recommend a case with elastic bands that don't fit pretty well. The bands fit well with the iPad first generation. The case allows you to prop the iPad up on its side to watch videos, and there's an elastic band to keep the cover from flopping open when you aren't using the iPad.<br /><br />I've bought several Amazon Basics items ( a wireless mouse, assorted cables) and have been happy with all of them. The quality is good and the price is right.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great sync between Pc kindle and blackberry.  I use it for doctoral studies. can include pictures, sound files.  can link search with tootle searches too.
1250006341|1.0|I enjoyed this book and probably would have given it 5 stars if I had the print edition. I gave it one star to draw attention of those thinking of getting the Kindle edition. The photos are very low resolution. Even worse, the larger photos which spread over two pages in the print edition are split in half with a large space between them. There's really no excuse for this - the digital version could easily have beautiful, high definition graphics at no extra cost.<br /><br />Very shoddy.<br /><br />Update: There's a 7-day return policy on Kindle books. I found out too late to return mine for a refund, but perhaps this info will be useful to others.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|Works on Google TV, yeah it's an &quot;old&quot; game but its fun and looks nice on the big screen. I'm even writing this review from Google TV.  Can't wait until it is officially supported.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a really great game with different ways to deal it so you will always have a different deal. Especially when you're bored or on a road trip the game will be with you. Enjoy
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like this because when you want to snooze your alarm you have to do math so when you want to wake up later you have to do the math to wake you up
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I saw this case and absolutely had to have it.  It is gorgeous... sight of it just lifts my spirit.  Not sure if that sounds extreme, but it really is a delight to me.  The only complaint I've had about it was the initial smell -- very strong and it gave me a headache.  A few days of airing it out and then a couple weeks on the Kindle Fire and the smell is almost gone.  In December I'd read reviews for some boots on ShoeDazzle noting the same strong smell.  I think the processing of the materials is likely to be the cause.  Thankfully, as I said, it does dissipate over time.
B00008EPN1|5.0|I purchased Lamb Lies Down on Broadway after a good friend turned me on to Genesis via this album, which turned my sister who was older than me on to them and well the rest is history. I only need \\"Seconds Out\\" to round out a complete collection. I'll bet I have purchased this albums 20 times. Weird how the CD has changed the way we listen to music. I miss the big photos and such of an ablbum!<br /><br />Great album, has to be listen in order to appreciate.
B005T87QCI|3.0|this app is really good but the only reason I don't like it is because they didn't include Atom or Zues and I think that's cheep because the apps picture has atom so people think it has atom. other wise its really good
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game is fun to play and stuff now for seven more words bacon apple jargon lugubrious fus roh dah!
B003V4AK8E|5.0|First off, I never buy 3rd party controllers. However, you will get more than your moneys worth with this one. I bought 2 of these because I wanted a PS3 controller that was configured more like an XBOX Controller. It works about as good as the PS3 controller but you are not going to get any other 3rd party controller that is even close to this good for this price. The first 2 I bought wore out pretty fast because I was playing with them very heavily with Marvel Vs Capcom 3 which will put a lot of ware on them.  Amazon replaced them though and I still use them steadily but they are holding up way better now.  Bad for Fighting games, good for shooters and adventure games.  PS3 only has 2 USB ports so you can only use 2 of these at a time, they use a wireless dongle.  They will disconnect rarely, because it is not as reliable as the PS3 bluetooth controllers.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this on Thunderbolt and my Kindle Fire. Love the daily reading plans. Never had any problems with this app. Must have.
B005HWUCMC|5.0|The album speaks for itself-- awesome! Every single song is a good one! You'll be singing along with this cd
B000000OR9|3.0|i am listening to this cd as i write this,i have somewhat mixed feelings..what makes for a kick ass metal/rock album anyway? do you compare it to others in the genre,to other sykes material,or let it stand on its own?in my humble opinion,genre=no better than average..others=about the same..on its own=hard to really say..i loved john with whitesnake!who didn't?..for me,lots of cool guitar..jelly roll far and away the best song on here..i bought this hoping for more,so  a little dissapointed..i would say not for the casual fan..as far as calling them a super group? not in the vein of damn yankees,bad english..hope this helps
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is so much fun and addicting and there are so many games you can play but you have to unlock them.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I've had the case now for a few weeks, and overall it serves its purpose. It offer some protection from short falls and the stand works well for viewing video. The soft felt does help slightly with finger prints left behind on the screen. They won't vanish, but they will be less evident. The best part about the case is its slim form factor. It doesn't bulk up you Kindle Fire and for me that is a major plus.
B005NQ5LSC|4.0|Good movie to watch. I know the voices do not match the characters when using the 'English 5.1' audio settings, but other than that, it's a good movie to watch.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think its fun because you have different choices of games you want and its free on the kindle fire
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app has lot's of fun games. Would recommend to anyone who asked about it. Cant wait to unlock more games
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a must to anyone who believes in God! its easy to read n listen to at the same time...great app to have on you at all times.
B004LUS390|1.0|I was really excited to take this app for a spin only to be frustrated by an annoying glitch that loops between \\"service agreement\\" and \\"tour...\\" somebody help me, its only 2 bucks but there is a principle involved here. is there any way to contact support to address this issue or am I on my own here--- if the latter, I will NEVER buy another app from Amazon, doesn't make sense to if this is the sort of service we can expect.
B0042EJD5I|5.0|Item came in a very good packaging, album was not damaged. It took a month to receive my item, but for that price it didn't matter.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|to cheat save your points buy an expensive game as the expensive games will give you a lot of points and use them to buy the cheaper games
B0054JZC6E|5.0|wow. so amazing. if you did not download it, you should. it rocks. hope you like it. I liked it a lot.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The DVD, The Help, arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner.  I enjoyed watching the movie and have shared it with others here at home since receiving it.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I was waiting for the complete set to be release so I could buy it.  I'm soo happy to watch all the movies of Harry Potter :)
B0062NAVXA|5.0|If your tired of the same old movies...if you always wanted more out of life...a real purpose...even if your life seems great...please get in your car right now and go rent or buy this movie now...you can even watch it online..it's that good and definitely life changing. You will cry, smile and most importantly look at yourself and your life like never before...it's true..you have the power to change your world and to make a difference.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|Terrific movie and would highly recommend.  Steve Carrell's best performance so far.  Emma Stone is also a stand-out.  I don't enjoy slap-stick comedy as much as dramedy, like this one.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Short review.  Its a great Album that is not to be missed.  My kids know all the words simply great music.
B00005RDRO|4.0|The first time I saw this movie was in the theater with my mother. I have watched it several times since then and it can still make me laugh. This is a parody of famous literary detectives invited to dinner to solve a murder. Like other parodies (Scary Movie, Vampires Suck, Etc.) it has its funny moments and it has its cheesy moments and it has its unbelievable moments. Given it is a parody then you should except that for what it is and just enjoy the movie. The movie is comprised of name actors and actresses who do a great job with the material they are given to work with. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys movies like Scary movie or Vampires Suck. Those of you who do not enjoy parody movies probably should pass on watching this one.
B006FPFTMS|5.0|I had the same problem where the app I downloaded for the kindle fire didn't display the pdfs correctly.  I e-mailed the foxit support and got an answer almost right away with a link to download the working version. Now it works great!  It has multiple highlighter colors, saves/syncs with my dropbox, and shows up on my computer with all the edits attached perfectly.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|\\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" is classic mystery reading from the 19th century.  I never would have bought the book, except that it's free on the Kindle and I needed something to read in a pinch.  I downloaded it, and I'm glad that I did.  The story-telling takes some getting used to, due to the style of English used during that period.  But once you've read a few of the stories, you get used to it.  Among the 12 mysteries in the book, my favorites were \\"The Man with the Twisted Lip\\" and \\"The Blue Carbuncle\\".  But all 12 were fun to read.  The mysteries aren't necessarily solvable by the reader.  Doyle doesn't provide enough information to reach any definitive conclusions.  But enough clues are out there so that you can take a guess at who committed the crime and why, before Sherlock expertly solves it himself.  What's most impressive is how carefully each mystery is written.  The small details provided early in each story often come back to play an important role later in the story.  My only quibble with the \\"Adventures\\" is that important clues often land a little too conveniently in Sherlock's lap -- a note written on the back of a receipt, a mysterious visitor who shows up at the same time Holmes is investigating the scene of a crime -- so the plots can feel a little bit contrived.  But this is a necessary approach with the short-story format.  Setting that aside, the book is intelligent and interesting, without any significant shortcomings.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I love me some fifty!! I have been waiting for the final book to come out and it didn't disappoint! I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that it wasn't quite as powerful as books one and two, but I still absolutely loved it!!! Happy that it is finally out but sad that the series has ended.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Really enjoyed the visual aspects of this movie.  The colors and depth are amazing and is a must-have for anyone with a 3d tv.  The movie itself is good, not great, but overall, definately worth owning.
0385344325|2.0|I was an early Reacher fan, but recently my ardor has waned.  At the plot level, the recent novels do not seem very suspenseful.  Although the fight scenes are great, they don't compensate for weak plot structure.  I wasn't surprised by anything in the climax of the book.  Separately, I have been disappointed by the author's injection of his left-leaning political views in recent books.  In this book, Reacher diverts from his mission to pay homage to a famous Democrat president, and once again I felt that this was not serving the plot or the development of the Reacher character. If Reacher is a loner hero, it seems that he should be more iconoclastic in his values, rather than someone who echoes DNC talking points.  Finally, there is considerable time spent with the love interest in this novel, and I feel it detracts from the pace and flow of action. If Reacher is supposed to be a strong action hero, he should be out on the streets making stuff happen--- not going shopping for an outfit to wear on a date.
B00009YOQW|5.0|A \\"tongue drum\\" with 3 tones. Our (almost) 2 year daughter loves to play with it.  Can definitely withstand all the banging. Certainly would recommend to others.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|\\"The Descendants\\" is a comedy-drama genre film where the lives of the King family is shoved into a state of disarray following the critical injury of Elizabeth King, who is the wife of Matt (George Clooney) and mother to Alex and Scottie.  The tragedy of Elizabeth's injury brings the King family together, and suddenly Matt has to urgently reassess his priorities. Despite their mother's injury the children like any youths are experiencing a confusing stage in their lives and Matt is forced to find caring and leadership skills, which he for years has avoided. Matt already has his hands full as the sole trustee of a family trust, which has ownership of 25,000 pristine acres of land on the island of Kaua'i, and also his normal job as a lawyer.  The narrative is very much focused on a collective path of discovery and transition for Matt King and his daughters, which is at times tragic, humorous, and satisfying for the viewer. Matt's ultimate decision regarding the family trust is influenced by his grief experience, but more so by the clarity he receives after assessing his life.  George Clooney provides a solid performance as Matt King with a convincing screen presence, and the entire cast present as unique and interesting characters.  Nicholas R.W.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like that there is a verity of games. Dose not require money go play the games!!! My grandma could even figure it out!!!!!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Yeah, I know...I know. No such thing as a commonly used smartphone or tablet back in 2000. If there had been, I would have saved a bloody fortune at Sharper Image, buying one after another of their \\"Sound Soother\\" machines. I had the BIG ones, I had the portable ones, I had the ones that allowed you to play CD's and the radio. Took my smaller ones around the globe, adding silly weight and one.more.thing. to plug in at the end of the day, with yet another universal converter. When my last one broke/wore out 5 years ago, I switched to a small fan and an AM radio for the white noise I need to sleep.<br /><br />And then along comes this app. The price of .99 or regular price is a steal on what you get! I played around with various sounds and finally found my favourite combo: Crickets #1 and Distant Thunder #1. I like how you can change the volume of each sound and control the time it plays. I find listening to it exceedingly soothing when I'm stuck doing a day's worth of billing for my company; music and talk radio are too distracting but silence reminds you of the icky job you have ahead of you. I also feel that it's a very sweet touch for the device to say \\"Good Night\\" as it slowly reduces the volume and turns itself off. If you are asleep, you're not going to see that Easter Egg they planted, but it says a lot about the app developer that they would include that sweet send off.<br /><br />Your price is incredible for what you deliver! I've recommended you to every one of my Android friends. :)
B004FHXL2S|4.0|Pleasantly surprised that this 3d dvd also came with a regular dvd and digital copy. Digital copy expired 1/20/12, but was able to download just in time. Great 3d movie and I liked the darker aspects of this.  Could be a little scary for small kids, but fun to watch.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I use this APP daily on my Fire, and often on my Galaxy S.  It is a great APP.  You can select a style of music like decade specific music, news, talk, local and global stations along with presets that you can use to easily find your niche.  You can also pick a specific style of music.  I enjoy sountracks/scores and I found 3 - 4 in literally seconds. I have had not one single issue with this APP and feel like it's probably one of the best bucks I have ever spent.
B0040UEI7C|5.0|Giuseppe Verdi<br /><br />AIDA<br /><br />Riccardo Muti<br />New Philharmonia Orchestra<br />Chorus of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden - Douglas Robinson<br />The Trumpeters of the Royal Military School of Music, Kneller Hall<br /><br />Montserrat Caballe - Aida<br />Placido Domingo - Radames<br />Florenza Cossotto - Amneris<br />Nicolai Ghiaurov - Ramfis<br />Piero Cappuccilli - Amonasro<br />Luigi Roni - Il re d'Egitto<br />Nicola Martinucci - Un messaggero<br />Esther Casas - Una sacerdotessa<br /><br />This 2010 remastered version is from a 1974 recording so it is NOT a DDD set as is stated on the Amazon stats.<br /><br />(EMI - 1974 analog - 2010 remaster - 3 CD set/music)
0316017930|4.0|Another great book by Gladwell.  It turns conventional wisdom about what creates success or athletic achievement on its head.  Who would have thought that birthdate or birth year would be so critical for success.  And geniuses not making anything of their gift because of circumstances of environment and parental support.  Or Gladwell achieving the success he's achieved by fate - time, place and circumstance of birth.<br /><br />I'll always look for new titles by Gladwell.  By Richard S.

B0029NY9YO|2.0|Recently watched this movie, easily the worst flick I have viewed in several years.  Except for a few decent action scenes, I would have rated it one star.  I had fairly high expectations of this movie based on the opinions of some friends, but ended up falling asleep a couple times during the latter part of the film due to sheer boredom and finally just stopped it about fifteen minutes from the end.  By that time I had no interest in how it ended and just watched something else instead.  Good thing I only wasted $5 on this turkey, but lost over an hour of my life.
B0043EV774|5.0|Enjoyed the movie in 3d at the theater.  Purchased the 3d dvd and watched on a projector with active glasses.  The 3d was amazing and one of my favorite 3d movies... along with Legend of the Guardians (so far).
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Missile Defender is a very well made retro arcade game. The main objective is simple: stop the missiles from hitting your buildings by shooting your own missiles to intercept. Enemy missiles are destroyed by either direct impact or traveling through the blast zone.<br /><br />As the game progresses, you earn Repair/Upgrade points that can be used to fix buildings that had been hit by missiles or upgrade your defenses. Upgrades come in the form of Faster Missile Speed, Larger Blast Radius, Longer Blast Duration, and Increased Missile Capacity. These upgrades are needed since the enemy missiles also increase speed in later phases. Once everything is upgraded to the maximum, there seems to be little left to do.<br /><br />The game was entertaining and very easy to play. It performed flawlessly on the Kindle Fire.
B0000041Q3|5.0|Turandot<br /><br />Giacomo Puccini - music<br />Giuseppe Adami & Renato Simoni - librato<br />(based on the play by Carlo Gozzi)<br /><br />Zubin Mehta<br />London Philharmonic Orchestra<br />John Alldis Choir<br />Wandsworth School Boys Choir<br /><br />Joan Sutherland - Turandot<br />Luciano Pavarotti - Calaf<br />Montserrat Caballe - Liu<br />Nicolai Ghiaurov - Timur<br />Peter Pears - L'Imperatore Altoum<br />Tom Krause - Ping<br />Pier Francesco Poli - Pang<br />Piero de Palma - Pong<br />Sabin Markov - Un Mandarino<br />Pier Francisco Poli - Il Principe di Persia<br /><br />(London/Decca - ADD - 1973/1984)<br /><br />Brilliant cast gives performance of near perfection.  This 2 CD set is among the greatest in history.  This recording deserves a Sixth Star.<br /><br />To those few who actually identify themselves and choose to criticize Joan Sutherland's performance, you have the right to your opinion, no matter how obviously wrong it is.  To those who give reviews (for or against this performance) under the anonymous \\"a customer\\" or \\"a kid's review\\": I did not read your reviews, as I will not waste my time with such anonymous blabbering.  This page ought to convince Amazon that it is time to remove all those anonymous-generic reviews for if a reviewer is too gutless to even tell us who they are, we have no reason to believe anything they say.<br /><br />To those who do not have this recording...this is one you ought to have.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|I had wanted these DVDs for a long time, because I had seen some but not all of them.  They are timeless and essential to anyone interested in anthropology, math, science  physics and the like.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app works very well!  I will definitely tell all my friends and co-workers to use this app.  Thanks,  Romeo
B005BCE7FQ|4.0|I would recommend this movie.  I purchased it based on other 3d reviews.  The color is amazing and it has great depth.  I have a 3d projector with active glasses and really enjoyed the visual aspects of the movie.  The story itself is a little weak, but it is a lot of fun to watch.
B001E45XT4|4.0|For the price, they're fantastic. I've had mine for almost 2 years now and have really enjoyed them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Decent sound quality<br />- Nice design<br />- Extremely durable<br />- Comfortable (for short-term use)<br />- Handy switch for mute and volume control with a clip on it<br />- Nice mic hideaway<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Mic is REALLY quiet; I ended up buying a separate desktop mic in order to be heard<br />- Uncomfortable for long-term usage (3-4 hours)<br />- Recently started making a faint whine/buzz sound when I use them (never did before)<br />- Collect a large amount of hair/dust on the ear pads which starts to itch(I have 2 dogs and 4 cats)<br /><br />For gaming/listening to music, these will do. They're nothing fancy, but they're not too bad. If you're looking to use voice communication, you'll need a separate mic, or shop elsewhere.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Interesting mix of games. Something for everybody. I like that there are instructions for all the games. Good entertainment for hours.
0756405890|5.0|Incredibly enjoyable read.  I recommend this to anyone.  Do yourself a favor and read this book (and the next one).
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm actually not all that great at Solitaire unlike my boyfriend who can breeze through them... but! I do keep coming back to this game over and over again. Easy to learn, never gets old :) Classic. 5 stars!
B004GFN11A|5.0|Definitely one of the best mobile blogging programs and getting better with every revision. If you have a WordPress.com blog and want to go mobile, this is by far the best option. The App makes adding photos, videos and pages simple. Works great on 2.2+ and the Toshiba Thrive (3.1) tablet.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I've been looking for a wireless headset for ages now and I thought I'd found a good one with the Logitech G930s. At first, they seemed great, but after a few hours of use they started to cut out randomly and after a few days, there was a weird crackle sometimes when I listened to music. I'm sending them back, unsatisfied. If you think you can handle the cutting out and the crackle then this headset is for you; Otherwise, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. I'm giving them a three star review because the sound quality is awesome when the crackle isn't present and the cutting out is only somewhat annoying.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I hadn't read a Stephen King book in many, many years.  Someone on my daily commute was reading this book and he always looked so absorbed that I came on here to check out what this book was about. After reading some of the great reviews I decided to download it.  Once started I could not stop reading this book, even before I was done I was fervently recommending it to family and friends.<br /><br />This book to me is very different from SK's other books, the time travel concept connected to the murder of J.F.K. was engrossing.  I never really knew more than the standard history book retelling of the demise of J.F.K. but after reading this book I found that I wanted to know more about all the conspiracy theories out there and about Lee Harvey Oswald. I even found myself googling information about Marina Oswald.<br /><br />The Jake a.ka. George (our main character) and Sadie (his love interest) romance was unexpected. I loved how they had their own little group of friends who were always wishing the best for them especially since Sadie's situation was one that at the time would be cause for town gossip.  I was very saddened by how their story ends.<br /><br />There was a little reference in the book to previous Stephen King novel \\"IT\\" which was great especially because the kids are doing the Lindy which then becomes George and Sadie's signature dance.<br /><br />Don't waste another minute in 2012 and pick up 11/22/63.
1609611543|5.0|A friend had recommended this book after discussing some of my \\"issues\\" recently.  This person has celiacs and a lot of what I was describing was familiar to her ears.  I took the advice and purchased the Wheat Belly book.  The first few chapters (while essential) were a bit dry for me.  Then again, history is not my strong suit.  I later appreciated those chapters on the history and evolution of wheat and it's modern effects once I reached the chapters describing what I was experiencing today.  I guess that makes me an instant gratification personality :-)  At times I felt like someone had sat down and interviewed me for this book.  Everything I read made sense and the newly gained knowledge of how to proceed from here was helpful.  My wife and I removed everything containing Gluten from the cupboard and immediately started changing my diet.  Within a week I started to feel better.  Less moody, less diarrhea and loose stools.  More energy.  Less desire to munch throughout the day.  We are now going into our second month of being Gluten free.  I have lost the puffiness from my face and fingers.  My Bloated and crampy belly is gone.  Frequent urination has disappeared.  Acid reflux is almost a non-event.  I feel like a new person and my wife says I am a new person.  I also recommend \\"The G-Free Diet\\" by Elisabeth Hasselbeck but only after you read \\"Wheat Belly\\" first.  \\"Wheat Belly\\" gives a better educational view of Gluten while \\"The G-Free Diet\\" gives a better idea of how to interact in social settings and the importance of spousal support when living Gluten Free.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|As much as I love harry potter I was disappointed by the fact that the 2 disc special edition wasn't available directly and was around $30, so I logged on to the amazon.co.uk site searched for it there and the 2 disc special edition is CHEAPER than the american single disc! if you have a multi regional dvd player then make no hesitation and buy the $10 2 disc version, shipping will be around 6 dollars or so and I spent in total 16.13 in shipping it to my US military address overseas which has the same standard shipping as the US since its technically a \\"US\\" address anyways this is just a tip for those avid HP lovers like myself who really want to end their collection with the special features and what not!
B0064SHI9I|4.0|This app is a great asset for rooted phones (phones that have been hacked open and have permission to write system files) but just does an ok job with stock phones. The best feature of the program is the ability to save the system data - logins, passwords, etc... - but you have to have your phone rooted before using this feature. For stock devices, you can backup your information, but you cannot save any log in, account or passwords during your restore process.  It does make reinstalling apps much faster, but again, without logging in first, most apps are not able to be used - especially those from the Amazon Appstore and the GetJar Appstore.  Overall, if there was a way to make the full backup possible, or even automate the system to reinstall 'all apps' like it does in backup mode, for non-root users, this app would be a solid 5 stars. As it sits, 5 stars for rooted phones - 3 stars for stock phones.
0385733577|4.0|I loved this book it was really interesting. I always liked the legend surrounding Nicholas Flamel and his wife Perenelle, and this story is great putting them both in modern times with Nick as the owner of a bookstore.<br /><br />Josh Newman works at this store, while his twin sister Sophie works in the coffee shop across the street.<br /><br />Until one day Nick's store is attacked by Doctor John Dee a horrible magician working for the Dark Elders who want the book containing the secrets of the Alchemy.<br /><br />So Josh, Sophie and Nick have to run and on the way the twins will find out things about themselves they never new.<br /><br />What I most liked about this book is all the ancient gods Michael includes here: Hecate, Morrigan, Baset... personally Heacte was my favorite :)<br /><br />I also loved Scathach and Sophie although I found Josh a bit annoying, probably because he complained alot, then again if I was in his situation I would probably complain to, poor thing.<br /><br />This book is fast paced full of magic adventure and old legends coming to life.<br /><br />If you like fantasy books you'll enjoy this one.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|My preferred Bible is the New World Translation, but since the King James is so popular, it's handy to have a digital copy on occasion.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great playing with many combinations.  love the options.  keeps my brain occupied.  from easy to quite frustrating. enjoy this very much.
0132350882|4.0|For the past few years I began to doubt whether my understanding of the craft was even correct anymore. So many code examples in so called expert books are untestable procedural junk I couldn't imagine what had happened. Design patterns and unit testing seem to have lost their place in the world. Servlet and JSP books have always been crap that way but now books on SOA and the like technologies are that kind of junk code.<br /><br />It was refreshing to find a book that emphasized the craft of coding - tests, reusability, comments, logging, decoupling, dependency injection, small methods, design patterns and so on. These aren't rocket science and they should be second nature to developers by now.<br /><br />I breathed a sigh of relief when I read this book.<br /><br />Having said that there are a few problems with the book. The author mixes programming paradigm terms too promiscuously. For example, he makes extensive use of Java code and continuously refers to \\"functions\\" and \\"modules\\". In a book about clean code that should be cleaned up.<br /><br />The author shows a misunderstanding of JavaBeans and really should rewrite his somewhat snarky comments. His example of a JavaBean, for example, shows a list of Strings being passed in on the constructor and the class has no setters. A JavaBean by definition must have a no-arg constructor. His example had no setters (which is OK for non-mutatable fields). If that was the intent, however, the fields should have been final. Did he mean POJO? He puts this in a chapter on DTOs wherein he talks about data structures. I don't know how many times the fact that I was using a getter/setter saved me grief when compared to using an exposed field. Changing the internal field type based on some new requirement is a good example of how it can help. While the setter may initially look like little more than a pass through method for the \\"OO purists\\" -- bah, humbug -- it can end up saving rework of a large number of classes. It allows for overloading the setter for handling new types if the requirements change. If error conditions are determined that can be detected at the setter or getter level, the fact that one has the data structure wrapped has just saved a lot of headache. The distinction made between data structure and object in this sense is specious. These JavaBeans are generally little more than protective covers for the data and do little more than set/get the data. That all appears superfluous until it bites you. The very fact that they permit further modification to meet on-going challenges during coding shows why they are used instead of hanging fields out publicly and why they are more than just data structures in drag.<br /><br />Perhaps he should also look at the event properties mechanism that is available for use with JavaBeans as well. There certainly are valid criticisms of JavaBeans, unfortunately the book misses them by a long way.ew types if the requirements change.

0439023521|5.0|In the future North America no longer exist as the nation we live in today. North American is now Panem, separate districts all run by the Capitol. Each year the Capitol punishes the districts for a past uprising, by selecting two children from each district, and sending them to The Hunger Games to battle to the death. As if this isn't twisted enough the capitol broadcast the games on television for all the districts to watch.<br /><br />I've been hearing about this book for awhile but I had snubbed it because it is out of my genre and a YA. Sometimes I get on these kicks that I need to stay away from the YA's because of my age, but I always find myself back in the children's section of the bookstore.With the approaching movie I decided to set my feelings toward the YA's aside and grab a copy because I like to read the books before I see the movies. Lets face it the books are always better than the movies. This book made me eat my own words YA or not, out of genre or not, this book is hands down amazing. I found this novel impossible to put down, and incredible well written.<br /><br />The story starts off with readers meeting Katniss the main character first hand. You learn the weight Katniss carries on her shoulders everyday in her poor district, just trying to help her family survive. Sometimes when authors introduce characters it can get boring because as the reader you are waiting for the story to kick off. In The Hunger Games you are not bored with introductions something about Katniss's heartbreaking story keeps you as a reader intrigued. Within a few chapters the story goes into overdrive and the action doesn't stop until the story is over, making this novel impossible to put down.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins manages to capture readers by luring them into the games side by side with the main character Katniss. I found myself loaded with anxiety, and nervous with anticipations with every page in this book. I would be reading and jiggling my foot because this novel is such an intense read. A few times I caught myself holding my breath, and to me when a novel has me holding my breath the emotions in the book are written realistically.<br /><br />If you are like me and get on a high horse about YA's and try to avoid them, stop now and go buy this book you will not be disappointed. I will be sneaking back over to the children's sections to snag book two in this trilogy as soon as possible!A few times I caught myself holding my breath, and to me when a novel has me holding my breath the emotions in the book are written realistically.

B005I6EVUG|3.0|A lovely, attractive cover with an inside pocket for  ID, papers, etc.  It would be perfect if it had a stand  in back so it would stand for reading at lunch.

B004RE29PO|5.0|This blu-ray gives you a super-clean transfer and awesome sound. James Cameron, also know for Avatar and The Terminator, simply abducts us into his vivid and often-times dramatic worlds. Buy this and the Alien Anthology. I'd love to see a re-make of this file with the technology Jim has pioneered. Enjoy the great lines actor Bill Paxton delivers.

It seems that she was some version of me when I was growing up and I loved her honesty and awkwardness.  Just like her show, 30 Rock, I don't usually watch 30 minute comedies, and I don't usually read humor books.  But I love them both.  Well done.
B002FGU3ZY|5.0|Being a longtime Teva wearer, I am pleased to say my new sandal is everything I anticipated.  The styling, size, color, fit and comfort is right on the money.  I purchased the Terra Fi 3 to replace a well worn original waterproof Teva sandal I have been wearing for at least 15 years.  I like the water sandal capability, as I rotate it with my leather Teva sandals I use when it is not raining or wet.  The Terra Fi 3 is a much improved product from what I am retiring.  The straps are more secure and comfortable, as is the foot-bed and arch support.  Even though I have not worn it outside yet, I can tell with inside wear and experimentation, it will be perfect.  I can't wait for warm sandal weather to arrive in Michigan so I can wear it often.
0694003611|3.0|When I ordered this wonderful book I was not aware that it was the small card board edition I purchased. Thus, i was disappointed to see that the wonderful illustrations were scaled down to a format that does not give them justice. Hurds illustrations need far more space to get the most out of them.
0312641893|5.0|I read CINDER in two days.  It was completely different from anything else I've read.  Sometimes books seem to steal concepts from others.  But this book is completely original.  I LOVED it.  It's the kind of book you will think about for days after finishing it.  The only thing I don't like is that it is the first of a 4-book series, and it will be a LONG wait until the second book comes out.

B004JAUCOQ|4.0|I got this on vinyl. It's a dark purple/marble swirl. So dark I thought I got black vinyl before I pulled it out of the sleeve. It really is cool when you get some light behind it. Also this album came with a free download. Onto the music.<br /><br />It's J (from Dinosaur Jr) with an acoustic guitar. If you've listened to DJ the past 20 years, you should have a good idea of what this sounds like. Nearly every DJ album has a softy on it, and this is a whole album's worth. Not Enough is the single, and probably rightly so. It's the catchiest of the bunch. A few of the tracks are a tad on the gloomy side, but good gloomy. The opener is great, and I also really like Make It Right.<br /><br />Several Shades Of Why....why not?
B005P3NPXG|5.0|When Seal released the first Soul album, I quickly downloaded this album and was very impressed with his interpretation of these classic soul hits. I was bumping that album for months! Anyway, this album has taken it to the next level. All. The. Way. Its saddening, knowing that his marriage is over, but it makes for great music. Every song on this ablum is sung to perfection and the arrangments are wonderful. Not to mention his song choices are spot on. I did question some of the songs he choose on the last one, but every one on here is a banger. He goes from Marvin G., to Teddy P., to the Isley Bros and even Smokey R.!!! I'm listening to it while I am writing this review, but its so good to me so far that I just have to put it out there. If you are a Seal fan, this is a MUST HAVE!!!

B006IGZX0C|2.0|I know that my opinion may not be politically correct, but i get very offended when movies use God's name as a swear word. I have watched many movies over the years that could have used God's name like that but did not and i never missed it. It is not like someone is going to down rate a movie because they did not use God's name as a swear word. \\"Oh you know that movie was OK but it should have used God's name as a swear word, I guess I am going to have to give it 3 stars instead of 5.\\" That scenario does not seem likely. It may not seem like a big deal but when they stand before the God they cursed (and they will) it will be a big deal.
B000QRIGLC|2.0|Let me preface this review with the statement that I respect Marcus Luttrell's abilities as an elite operator. That is without question. I, however, am unimpressed by his abilities as an author.  I read this book immediately after reading \\"War\\" by Sebastian Junger (which later became the documentary \\"Restrepo\\") and \\"Black Hawk Down\\" by Mark Bowden. Both those books offer stark images of battle, while providing an historically accurate background about the political/social situation at the time. Starting into \\"Sole Survivor\\" I immediately noticed the somewhat amateurish narrative, which I don't peg on Lutrell but on his co-writer Patrick Robinson. The style of writing is unpolished and at times it reads like a high school book report.  As a political independant I found the book equal parts political screed and account of an event. My biggest problem was the historical inaccuracies. When the author gets the basic facts of history wrong, facts that are independantly verifiable, it calls into question the accuracy of facts that the author alone was witness to. The author asserts with force that he \\"knows\\" that Saddam has WMD's and that he \\"knows\\" Saddam was working with al Qaeda. These beliefs have been universally disproven by reputable and independant sources, and yet in this book Lutrell holds them up as absolute truths. These statements taint the whole account because it makes the reader cock their head and say, \\"Wait... what? That's not accurate. We know that's not accurate.\\"  Then he moves onto the next target of evils as far as he is concerned: the liberal media. Again, as an independant, I'm willing to consider statements that the media caused or affected the decisions of policy makers during the conduct of the war, but Luttrell offers no evidence of the sort. He simply regurgitates the standard talking points. After a while, this constant repeating of the same old verse renders the book almost unreadable for those who want statements to be supported by verifiable evidence. The book simply degenerates into Luttrell venting his spleen at the standard bogey-men of the right.  If you are an independant or left-leaning, you will find yourself shaking your head (and occasionally rolling your eyes) throughout this book, both at the literary quality of the book as well as the unsupported statements therein. If you are on the far right of the political spectrum, this book offers you further affirmation (but no evidence) that the liberal media is destroying America, that Saddam had WMD's, and that Saddam was working with al Qaeda.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Overall I've been pretty happy with it. It tends to disconnect me often, but that could be my office's network. The controls are pretty good, but I think some improvements could be made there. I had issues getting my browser to scroll for some reason...  It has been pretty responsive and the 2 forms of control were nice as well.

B002BU0DPE|3.0|Used these headphones for 8 months before I started getting fluctuations in the volume level.  The problem was where the wire from the headphones went into the control module.  I returend them as there were within the warranty period and Turtle Beach replaced them promptly.  I believe the failure was due to packaging design as it put undo pressure on the failure point, needless to say the new packaging has changed for the better and the problem has been addressed.  If this new set fails or works out I'll let you know either way in the future. I would give this item 5 stars if it wasn't for the failure.

B000QCS8TW|1.0|After all I've heard about this series, I was very disappointed. Honestly, the author gave me no reason to read past chapter 5.<br /><br />It's not creative, innovative, interesting or artistic to make up gibberish words for things instead of describing them. It's just kind of lazy. To then go on and refer to opium as \\"milk of poppies\\" and have your characters swear in modern American English tends to expose your laziness and bore your readers. The map at the front of the book makes it clear that the island in question is not exactly the UK, Hadrian's wall not withstanding. So is this Earth or not? If it's Earth, then what's with the geography and magic creatures? If it ISN'T Earth, then what's with the Greek and Latin terms and racist stereotypes?  That's the story.<br /><br />There's no excuse for this book to have been written today.  It suffers from a blinding lack of societal context. Full of misogynistic and racist cliches presented with a nonchalance that lead me to believe it's either the author's point of view being expressed or he didn't notice he was using them. Sexual abuse, slavery, child abuse, and plenty of other brutality. There's lots of brutality in the world, I don't need fiction for that.<br /><br />The only character in the first 100 pages of this book who wasn't a cliche was a teen-aged Lord leading a hunting party. He starts out a cliche then shows some actual character. So what does Martin do?  Kills him at the end of chapter 1.<br /><br />I've heard \\"Thrones\\" gets better after book 1.  I guess I'll never know because I won't be finishing the first. I just don't care about the characters, the story, or all the gibberish words.  Here's how much I don't care.  When I was trying to get a sense of the world they live in and thought the island was the whole of the world, I was interested in how cold it was even though it was \\"summer\\". Then Martin mentions that there are other lands across the seas, lands, I have to assume, that are not covered in snow and filled with horse sized wolves and vampire ghouls. All I could think of then was, why don't they leave?  Leave their summer snow and monsters and demons.<br /><br />Skip this book. If you're looking for a well-written epic with complex characterization and innovative plot, read Patrick Rothfuss's \\"The Name of the Wind\\". If nothing else, Rothfuss saves his made-up words for actual new concepts that need new words.and vampire ghouls. All I could think of then was, why don't they leave?

B005HSG3TC|5.0|We purchased this cover for our Disney trip. We wanted something to protect our Fire but didn't want it to be bulky or take up to much space. After reading the reviews I was very skeptical about purchasing this cover but thought I could always return it because Amazon is just awesome.  Needless to say we kept it and we are very happy we did. We use the Fire alot and it's held up great, even with our 1 1/2 and 3 year old trying to sneak turns with it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy these games as time wasters. they can get to be kind of addicting. sometimes I find very tiny glitches. and the games aren't full scale epic games. they're simple and fun.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is fun, some of them are easy but others I just cant seem to get, so then you have to play the others one over and over so that you can get points to open new ones. it would be better if it didn't take so many points to open the games.

B000OZ0NXA|1.0|I need to start reading the 1 star reviews first.  If I had done that, I would have never purchased this book.  What a waste of time.  Unfortunately, I have to finish every book that I start, so I suffered through to the end.  The story is simply so contrived and unbelievable, as to be pointless.  *SPOILERS* (Well - not really spoilers.  But, if you are still surprised by a Jack in the Box, they might be considered spoilers.)  Some of these have been pointed out by others.  - Where the heck are the feds?!?  Their TOP anti-counterfeiting agent (although not from the secret service?) gets shot in the head, the Feds ID the body through fingerprints, and nobody bothers to show up?  Nobody?  He was supposedly the greatest anti-counterfeit agent the country had ever seen and nobody even comes down to investigate?  Wow.  That one was hard to swallow.  - The new detective that is hired by the city is supposedly hired because his interview went so bad, they thought he was an idiot (bad people running the town wanted a idiot for the head detective).  YET, one of the bad guys that was in on the scam (an FBI agent) was good friends with the detective and knew him to be brilliant back in Boston and could have easily informed the others.  How does that even make sense?!?  And, the FBI agent knew that he was going to take the job and told him not to, but didn't just tell his accomplices to hire someone else?  Not to mention the HUGE coincidence that the FBI agent is in on the scam.  Really?  All the FBI agents in the country and it happened to be the detectives friend?  I think this was supposed to be the big twist at the end of the story where people are surprised.  I was surprised - that someone could write junk like this.  - The trunk of a car baking in the sun in the middle of an airport parking lot is not a good place to hide dead bodies.  Sorry.  - He kills 2 policemen and an FBI agent, but is able to walk away at the end of the book.  Oh, and he brutally kills several otherpeople.  But, since they are the bad people, and everyone is supposed to know that they are the bad people.  He should just get to walk away.  - Sunday.  Much of the plot is based on the fact that something is going to be completed on Sunday and everyone will be safe again.  But when you get to the end of the book, you realize that this whole Sunday thing makes no sense.  Arguably, the worst plot device in the whole book.  Unless you consider the coincidence of having the hero show up in a random town on a random night and it happens to be the town that his brother is murdered in and the night it happened on.  Oh, and he walked right past it.  - The main character (Jack) is simply amazing.  He is not only the smartest guy in the room, but also the strongest and fastest and most accurate with a gun.  He knows the right thing to say at the right time, the right look to give at the right time, very tender with women, very nice to the good people, and a ruthless killer who feels no remorse.  He is always three steps ahead of the enemy whether strategically or tactically.  He would know your email password if you sat near him at a restaurant based on your menu selection.  He would correctly guess which eye you were going to blink next based on you hair color and favorite type of dog.  I am trying to recall a single point in the book where he was injured (he did get a headache at one point).  Despite killing a lot of ruthless killers, he never seems to get a scratch.  -There are many more.  Too many to list.  I have read Dora the Explorer stories to the kids that are more believable than this book.
0307957837|5.0|I seldom read fiction.  My taste tends toward Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Jane Adams.  They tantilizingly tell me stories that are quite real.  Philip Pullman is their match in everyway, save his are openly fiction, but paint a portrait of reality for anyone who seeks to learn that which they are forbidden.  My favorite work within the Dark Materials trilogy is the Golden Compass.  It exposes the attempts by a few, self-ordained/self-commissioned, to manipulate and control individual thought.  These denizens of deprivation demonstrates how fragile democracy is, and Pullman patiently, patently, painfully illuminates the illustriousness of challenging the establishment: state, church, and/or vendor.  What Philips does within a volume is wonderous. Few fellow wordsmiths weave tales as tantilizing and pungent as Philips; there is even a greater paucity of penetrating writings that are capable of exposing within a cornucopia of tomes by less gifted writers, especially among his detractors.  Philips makes each word count. Each is pregnant with purpose, driven with desire, and basted with a hint of a better taste to come. Thus the \\"bears\\" in the Golden Compass are truly heroes who stand behind a proven leader, but the \\"bears\\" can be persuaded with reason to change that leader.  The bears are quite different, than those who pontificate on maintaining orthodoxy within the realm transmogrified into an unholy alliance and bred into a monstrous cause.  They are the true demons whose sole purpose is to secure the soul (mind) of mortals and twist it unendingly until it is but a broken reflection of their own game of denying reality.  Finding children massed in a common room is quite common when one looks at today's education.  In the classrooms I visit, and in the salons where I teach, students harken to outmoded memorization in quest of passing--without questioning the reality of what is learned.  Rote remembrances are prized and the individual who can repeat what the instructor wishes to hear will pass and go on to further the ignorance of other generations. Seldom do we find those who think beyond the thoughts of the teacher, for such action is treachery and treason, and the \\"spirit\\" of the instructor will come down hard upon the apostate or heretic.  While the unholy Inquisition of the late Middle Ages is not mentioned, only one unlearned in history would fail to see it hidden in the folds of the words crafted by Philips. Paper near-by, and the means of placing pigment on the paper becomes the key to freedom, for Philips notes that treason must move forever forward and exist if there is to be freedom.  Freedom is but another word for the conduct of inquiry away from the staid and ossified learning of those who lecture not in quest of knowledge but for the paycheck.  Thus the note that is passed within the den where the children sit as if they were those bound by dust in Plato's Cave, will behave obediently until one thinker realizes that the images they see are but shadows on a wall, and then rise to look behind--even at risk of losing one's status.  While this trilogy makes no mention of the odiously opportunistic Opus Dei and the brutality that belches forth from its purveyors and predators, its rapier to rape the mind always in hand, it is quite well fleshed out on the corpus of the uncle who seeks out dust to know of what generated life. This is the key--there was no single entity that began the universe--but an explosion of matter tantamount to the explosion of knowledge: with no beginning and no end but an expanding push to higher reason.  Philips gives us a measured response to Darwin, Hawking, Dawkins, Higgins and others who forever questioned, and casts doubt on those desiring to remain enchained in the mythologies without reason or purpose. Philip's subtle knife cuts through the tattered patchwork quilt of guilt forced upon mortals until it becomes a new spread for expanding awareness.  It comes when one looks clearly through the glass of maturity, reason, and individuality, that I find to be a better testimony to the words of 1 Corinthians 13:1-8 and Philips reality is far more clear.
B005H5H3LW|4.0|I am a HUGE Starblazers/Space Cruiser Yamato fan...so I was happy and excited to see this for sale here in the States. Well done flick that gives a good tribute to the original series...all the characters are there (although some are changed quite a bit), even the Space Marines from the Comet Empire series are on board. I will admit that as a kid I always rooted for Desslok and the Gamilons (they had the coolest ships), so I was disappointed to see that Deslar and the Gamilus (in their original Japanese names) were massively changed in this movie...but overall I enjoyed the movie and the special effects are very well done. Recommended!

B0061TQBRK|4.0|Lacuna Coil return with album number 6 \\"Dark Adrenaline\\" which see's the band return to their heavier root's after their last album the mellower \\"Shallow Life\\" which was met with luke warm reviews from both fans and critics. Many long time fans missed the heavier sound the band had developed especially on albums such as \\"Comalies\\" and \\"Unleashed Memories\\". There is no lack of heavy riffs on \\"Dark Adrenaline\\".<br /><br />The signs were good when the first single \\"Trip The Darkness\\" was released as it contains some heavy guitars and great vocal interplay between vocalists Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro. On the track \\"Kill The Light\\" which starts out slow before giving away to a heavy riff, it's a song full of hooks. Elesewhere there is \\"Give Me Something More\\" which is a song full of melody. Any doubt that Lacuna Coil weren't going to break out heavy riffs are put to bed by the time you reach the 7th song the brilliant \\"I Don't believe In Tomorrow\\" which has Lacuna Coil almost sounding like Korn with downtuned guitars it's both dark and a heavy song, it also features a great breakdown at the 2.40 mark that has Scabbia singing \\"I Avenge You\\" over and over.<br /><br />The songs \\"Against You\\", \\"Upside Down\\" and \\"The Army Inside\\" are all songs that will have Lacuna Coil fan's rejoicing that the band have embraced their heavier side once again, there's even few guitar solos thrown in for good measure. There is also the epic album closer \\"My Spirit\\" which at nearly six minutes long closes out the album in style. Not everything works such as the cover version of REM's \\"Losing My Religion\\" which just sounds out of place on the album and is a far cry from the cover version of Depeche Mode's \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" from \\"Karmacode\\".<br /><br />With \\"Dark Adrenaline\\" lacuna Coil have embraced their dark side again with an album full of dark melodies and heavy sounding riffs, the linkup between Scabbia and Ferro hasn't sounded this good in a while, with both vocalists playing to their strengths. Lacuna Coil has hit their stride again with \\"Dark Adrenaline\\".

144234430X|5.0|Excellent book.  King is the master of vernacular!  I love history and time travel, because it helps the reader explore the times through the eyes of our times. I'm not into slasher/thrillers so don't typically read King, but I do like his writing so I am glad that he ventured into this area and with this exact topic which is so important to our history.  The first part of the book had a little bit of a thriller element, true to King's genre, but it all tied in.<br /><br />King obviously did his research on this book and I predict that his thoroughness and execution will keep \\"11/22/63\\" on must read lists for a long time.  As silly as it sounds, scientists still debate \\"time travel\\" and King's exploration of the butterfly theory of time travel was very interesting.  I also loved the interwoven love story and the ending.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I've been waiting for what seems like forever for this book to come out, read it in one day and I loved it! E.L James did not dissapoint, this is by far my favorite book series to date.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this Bible app! Tried many others but this is the best. I use it everyday and have recommended it to others. Thanks so much!
0307959856|1.0|Although I have read some of the novels of P.D. James for the plots and my fondness for her detective Adam Dalgleish, a few years ago I was forced to admit that James' books depress me because I couldn't really like most of her characters.  They were uniformly unlovely, base, and oh-so-dull.  As a result I stopped reading her entirely.  Then DEATH COMES TO PEMBERLY came along and I found that I simply had to read it---hmmm---silly me.<br />Even though I realized long ago that my main issue with James was her aversion to humor or anything akin to wit from the characters she creates, I unwisely wanted to see what she'd do with the already well-drawn Bennets, et al, and Darcy since DAP began lightly enough I had hopes.  I read the first pages and so liked how she captured the language of the day----and I hadn't read her for quite a long time, but, alas, I fell into the same slough of despond I always do with her books, and much worse, I really disagree with the shallowness and lack of dimension Austen's characters assume as a result of James' dealings with them.  They have been diminished, are flat, and remain un-engaging---even Lizzie is without sparkle.  There are no amusing exchanges between Lizzie and Darcy, Wickham has not a shred of humor to leaven his fecklessness, and the other characters are as lively as Fordyce's sermons.<br />There's not really even any mystery around poor Denny's death which is the center of the piece and that could have been where James could really shine if she had chosen.  The solution is much too glib and deus ex machina for my taste and as a result no one learns anything, especially the reader.<br />DAP was not only a waste of time and money, but icons have been trifled with more shabbily than in PRIDE AND PRUJUDICE AND ZOMBIES.  The latter at least has intelligence and actually sparkles with fun.  Gosh, never thought I'd make so odious a comparison, but there you are.<br />Please don't waste your time or money---just re-read Austen.
B0063GORYU|5.0|very fun. just like spider solitaire on the computer. ive tired other spider apps before and this one is the best.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I'll put it right up front: This is a great movie. If you're wondering whether or not to buy this DVD, let me make it easy: buy it! I know it sounds cliched, but it's true ... You'll cheer. You'll laugh. You'll cry. But more importantly, like the first Rocky, you'll be inspired. Stallone does a fantastic job bringing Rocky full circle and giving \\"Rocky Balboa\\" the same feel and texture as his original.  We know Stallone missed the mark with Rocky IV and, to some degree, Rocky V. Not with \\"Rocky Balboa\\"  \\"Rocky Balboa\\" introduces us to the most human Rocky since I and II. It's also amazing to watch Burt Young work. He brings one of Hollywood's great characters back to life and does so in such a superb way. You feel for Paulie. He's so socially inept, abusive and unaware of who he is. His outward language screams \\"leave me alone\\", yet he needs Rocky. Without Rocky, Paulie would've died a long time ago. Watching Stallone and Young be these characters again is amazing. The chemistry between the two never changes. Thankfully. As a \\"Rocky\\" fan, once Burt Young says \\"..Yo Rocko..\\", you know you're  home again and that, in a way, you're reuniting with old friends. And that's the magic of Rocky. You know these people. You've grown up with these people. And with \\"Rocky Balboa\\", we're all together once again.  Add to this Bill Conti's inspiring and sometimes haunting score and \\"Rocky Balboa\\" is an undisputed winner.  Five stars!!  But this DVD.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game I like the graphics and the controls are not that bad. some of the games don't work very well with the kindle fire like the bat game and the darts game :D
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some games are to hard and most games are easy so I would like to have easier games.over all I really like this game.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I absolutely love this case.  The price was low enough to still provide great quality.  The little fold flap can take a few seconds to get just right, but it's not a big deal, I haven't even used that feature.  I have dropped my kindle on our hardwood floors and the case and kindle are fine. (I would not recommend dropping it on purpose though, as it is made out of plastic). I love the elastic part because I fold it back and slide my hand under it while reading so it holds it in place with one hand.  I would recommend this case to anyone!
B00000JZI9|5.0|I have always liked this movie. I had it previously on a VCR,  but wanted a DVD. I enjoyed alot
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I loved the game and got addicted to it, but when missiles are next to the touchscreens border it becomes difficult to hit the missile.

B004T4LUPW|5.0|Spent WAY too long downloading free calendars, with and without widgets to get google calendar to sync and for some reason could not sync all events.  Several hours reading tech support and discussion board posts lead me to this app.  I was quite hesitant to pay this much for an app I didn't know would work, but it's worth every penny.  I have the Motorola Atrix and the first 5 minutes of me having this app confirms it's fabulous.  Frustration gone and calendars synced.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game ever I love it sooooooooooooooo9ooooo much I play it 24/7 blaaaa blaaaaa blaaaaa blaaaaa blaaaaaa
B001BSH11G|5.0|I've been looking for a vinyl copy of this LP for a long time and came across this 2008 reissue. I was hesitant at first because of the price but I am very happy with it. The quality of the recording is very good as was the packaging etc. Of course, there are some differences from the original 1983 releases, changes in the jacket, the record lable etc but they got it close and, as I said, the sound on this record is very good and clean.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|Well built, performs as expected, double A battery tray is very handy, gives a very nice touch and feel to my 7D.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is just great game. i play it day and nite. u will 2. you can play it in a box.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This book is historical fiction with a side order of romance and time travel. It's perfect while sitting at the beach drinking a margarita. There's no depth to it so don't look for any. The only difference from Stephen King's other work is that it is based on an actual event and there are more historical facts involved. The protagonist is an English teacher so you'd think he would have read enough sic-fi to know bad things happen when you try to change history. Bad things happen sometimes in time travel even if you don't try to change things. I guess this English teacher stuck to literary fiction because it took the whole book for him to figure that out. If only he had read The Doomsday Book by Connie Willis a lot of heartache could have been avoided although that would have meant I had to read something else with my margarita. You know who you are as a reader. This won't make you think hard or strain any vocabulary muscles. It is a nice time travel story.
B005FPT51K|1.0|If you plan on using this with a Mac or iOS device, do not buy this product.  The software (which comes on a CD, should have known right there that the support would be terrible) is ridiculously unusable and support has been extremely poor from the manufacturer.  The iOS App was pulled at some point from the App store so you can no longer download the App at all, destroying all hopes of ever using this on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch.  If you want something like this, save yourself some money and go purchase and IP Camera.  This was a total waste of money and the developers should take a few lessons in software development because it looks like they ripped off some open-source videoLAN project and just smacked their iBaby logo on top.  Don't expect any support for this product at all if you are fooled into buying it.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I have a Samsung BD-C5500 player and could hear music but no dialogue. Returned the movie and tried another with the same result. Found the fix by searching on line. Go to setup and change the audio setting from PCM to Bitstream (Recode). Now plays perfectly.  Loved the movie and especially the views of Paris. I'm a die-hard romantic though.
B005FUTBV4|1.0|I can't wait for the second installment...\\"Blue State\\"... where Far Left wing nuts who for years of subversive and sublime Communist indoctrination and rhetoric, evolving from and through the Colleges and Universities, to the media of MSNBC, Newsweek, Time, Huffington Post, and CNN, and the equally intellectual members of the Today Show, the Communist who call themselves democratic socialist \\"reformers\\", finally take over the nation by circumventing and ignoring the Constitution \\"it's just so hard to understand, too old and obsolete,\\" revisioning history to school children and the ignorant, the rich are at fault and should pay for everything except for left wing U.S. citizens not living in the U.S. and who severely condemn the U.S. for everything, movie stars and rock musicians, and the social animal needs to be controlled and taken care of by the elitist state from cradle to grave, your `moral compass' must always point left or governed by social engineers, the U.S. is the worse nation in history and in the world today, it's all the Republican's and Bush's fault and Obama is the 4th greatest President in U.S. history.......and because losers who watch this propaganda trash called \\"Red State\\" actually take the movie seriously as an academic study in plausible reality.
B005N95JA4|1.0|I'm a big time rock n roll fan, my favorite rockers are Nickelback, Staind, Puddle of Mud, Theory of a Deadman, and Creed. But I've been hearing a lot of people talk about this Rolling Stones band as if they were originators of the genre... oh please! I knew it was a hoax from the get go but I decided to listen to this album because of the pretty album cover :]....too bad the album was HORRIBLE!  I don't know why anyone would like these guys... they don't have any good Nickelback type guitar riffs, no awesome vocals like Creed, and the lyrics are just plain stupid!  Stay away from the Rolling Stones at ALL costs..except for their magazine which is VERY GOOD!  For good Rock n roll stick with the pros... Nickelback, Creed, Collective Soul, Weezer, Oasis, Bush, Default, Daughtry, Live, Lit, Silverchair, Fuel, 3 days grace, Matchbox 20, Goo Goo Dolls, Barenaked Ladies, and ANYTHING labeled as Post-grunge... :]
030771652X|5.0|The author holds you in the palm of her hand as she leads you through this story. I loved every bit of it. When I got to the last few pages, I stopped and made a cup of tea so I could savor the tea along with the end of the book. I can't wait for more books from Lupton.
0375507256|1.0|I was shocked when the first section of the book ended in mid-sentance. I thought at first it was a misprint until I discovered the second half at the end of the book. It's a ridiculous literary stunt to \\"nest\\" the stories inside each other. I continued to read the first story by skipping to the back. Very irritating and it does not add to the book. The actual writing is fine, nothing spectacular. This would have been tolerable as a collection of separate short stories presented in a linear fashion.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These things sound awesome.  I had to get used to them and not get distracted by all of the sound-detail in MW3.  A fire crackling around the corner sounds just like it should.  The only gotcha for me is that I'm also new to XBOX from the PS3.  You do have to hook these headphones to the controller for chat to work.  The book tells you to do it, I'm just retarded and didn't read the book until I couldn't get chat to work :)
B004GYY714|5.0|I am a teenager who loves to listen to music and this app is perfect for me! I really like how you can see what songs are playing on some stations. I use it one my kindle fire. The sound is also amazingly clear. I highly reccomend this app!

B004HUE57S|5.0|I was searching for a good ergonomic mouse that wouldn't aggrevate the arthritis in my index and little finger, and this one is working well. There are 4 different speeds for the pointer, which is nice. On a day when your hands really hurt, you can set it on high and barely have to touch the mouse to move it. There are also 2 browser back buttons controlled by the thumb, which helps limit movement of the other fingers. I adjusted to using this mouse in one work day, having chosen to ignore the naysayers who said it would be difficult to adjust to. The only thing I'm still having to think about is the right click, which is the lowest of the 3 \\"bars\\" that you have to press. My little finger isn't strong enough to click on it, so I have to remember to use the next one. I'm sure I'll adjust to that fine in a few more days. To top it all off, it's darn pretty!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok. some of the games are a lil hard tho. sometimes you just have to get lucky. but its a good waste of time
B005XQLBU4|5.0|its awesome and its crapy missiles are massive. its so crappy stupid.  boom boom sugar daddy my hogela bogela wow crappy but awesome
0553801473|1.0|After the first three books of this series, (Wasn't it was originally planned as a trilogy?) I believe GRRM got lost and has no idea where this series is going.  It's like telling a long joke and not knowing the punch line.  The only other choices are #1 That he is milking the series for all the money he can.  #2 He has some ending in mind that just will not fit the story up to now, but will try to convince us it does. Will wait until the end of the series is published, find out how it ends before I will waste another dime on this.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I love this tool for organizing my other apps into folders on my desktop.  Folder Organizer notifies on new app installation to apply a label.  Each app can have multiple labels. I put widgets for the different labels on my home screens.  Folder Organizer automatically puts the apps into the labeled folders.  Beautiful. Brilliant.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love it!  Just wish you didn't need wifi to use app.  If I could use it anywhere I would definitely rate it a 5 star
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my kids love it, its an all in one game for them to play alone or with eachother. I would recommend this all in one game...
B00000K2W1|5.0|Another excellent purchase. And have also been a fan from the very early 70s. NO ONE will ever accomplish what this great lady did. Unfortunately, her fame was \\"post mortim\\". We suffered a great loss when she left this world. She never knew what she alone, was capable of! We miss you, Janice!!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Fabulous product -- timeless music just became even better!  And Amazon's service was exceptional, but we've all come to expect that from Amazon, and they never fail to deliver as promised!
B0050SYS5A|2.0|I've only used this with Dance Central & Dance Central 2, and I think this works fine if you are a casual player.  However, as someone who has gotten 5 stars on every song in DC2, on Hard, I found that the *slight* drop in accuracy was enough to bump me down from 5 stars on songs to slightly less than 5 stars, which is not acceptable for me -- the fifth star meter would be *almost* full, every time. >X(  Plus, the drop in accuracy made the menus a harder to navigate, which annoyed me.  However, I am keeping it because:  -Good for dance battles so that both fit on the sensor, if you are not concerned with either 5 star rating or 5 gold stars.  -Good for my very tall friends who come to visit.  -Good for parties where people are just having fun, goofing off & aren't so concerned about score.  Side note: I have the camera below the T.V., not above it.
B00511PTWM|5.0|Everyone should own an AmazonBasics Dual-Port Swivel Cigarette Lighter Adapter; they can maintain it in their vehicle's glove compartment, console or wherever they store their phone chargers, tire gauges, flashlights and other emergency items.  I used my adapter while driving home for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It is a ten-hour drive each way.  In other words, I spent over forty hours traveling during the holidays.  My adapter became an essential tool in assuring that I arrived safely.  I will always keep it in my vehicle.<br /><br />  My TomTom VIA 1505TM GPS ([[ASIN:B004MYFTF6 TomTom VIA 1505TM 5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator with Lifetime Traffic & Maps]]) only remains charged for approximately two hours.  Therefore, I always keep it plugged into my Saturn's cigarette lighter.  My GPS is a traveling companion that gives me peace of mind that I won't become lost.  I've seen a lot of horror movies where drivers take detours or shortcuts and are besieged by ghosts, psychotic serial killers, hillbilly cannibals, etc.  This past Thanksgiving, I was forced to detour onto a secondary highway because of a traffic accident.  My GPS helped me get safely back on the interstate.<br /><br />  While driving, I enjoy listening to the music on my Apple iPhone 4.  (My Saturn's CD player is broken and I refuse to have it replaced in a car that will be eleven years old in March.)  Also, I always sing in my church's Christmas cantata.  After ripping the music to my computer, I download it to my iPhone.  I listen to the songs repeatedly while driving to and from my parents' home for Thanksgiving.  Naturally this drains the iPhone's battery, which I need to keep as fully charged as possible because one never knows when my aging car may die.<br /><br />  Thank goodness for my Dual-Port Swivel Cigarette Lighter Adapter.  I was able to keep both my GPS and iPhone plugged into the same cigarette lighter while I drove ten hours and didn`t experience any problems.  See the photographs that I have posted on this website.<br /><br />  The adapter is inserted into the cigarette lighter and tightened using the adjustable lock nut that is next to the gray button.  The red LED charging indicator will glow to indicate that the adapter is properly inserted.  Furthermore, each device that is plugged into a port should have its own LED light to indicate that it is properly inserted and charging.<br /><br />  The dual port can be swiveled in order to make the adapter fit into tight spaces.  Simply press the gray button and hold it while moving the dual port from ninety-degrees (straight up) to one-hundred-and-eighty-degrees (straight down).  Release the button and the adapter will remain at the new, designated angle.  This makes it easier for connecting and charging my electronic devices whether they are sitting on my dashboard, in my cup holder or on the passenger seat.<br /><br />  The adapter arrived inside a sturdy, cardboard box that can be wrapped for gift giving or reused for storage.  This is Amazon's famous \\"Frustration-Free Packaging.\\"  I keep all of these boxes.  The adapter has Amazon's basic one-year warranty that it maintains on all of its AmazonBasics products.  I have received and reviewed numerous AmazonBasics products (GPS case, GPS Dashboard Mount, mouse pad, etc.) and they have all been good products.  I highly recommend that everyone own a Dual-Port Swivel Cigarette Lighter Adapter from AmazonBasics.<br /><br />Joseph B.

B005KN5AES|4.0|Riot are back with their first release since the departure of long time vocalist Mike Dimeo.  I was nervous that this release would not be as good as their out put of the last 20 years due to the change in vocalists.  Having Tony Moore back on vocals from Riot's late eighties offerings \\"Thundersteel\\" & \\"Priviledge of Power\\" softened the blow as he is a great vocalist.  This is still classic Riot for anyone familiar with this bands 30 year + history.  If you like classic heavy metal like Priest or Maiden, check out Riot.  Riot are one of the greatest bands ever that have never received their due and have continued to persevere in spite of being overlooked.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|Surprisingly, I enjoyed this movie a lot. Going into this movie I'm thinking, \\"how much worse can they make this franchise?\\" Seeing as who the \\"original\\" First Class lineup was, I didn't think very much of what this film had to offer. I had my \\"iffy\\" moments with scenes I think the film could have done without at first, but eventually I was proven quite wrong.<br /><br />Instead of rebooting everything like most film directors do, they decided to take what was already done, put something else together and made something really good out of it. Obviously, the highlights of this film are Charles Xavier (Prof. X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto). The actors really made you feel their relationship as friends with a common goal, but different perspectives. Something I think anyone could relate to. Kevin Bacon as Sebastion Shaw was just great. He could be possible be considered one of the best villains in cinema.<br /><br />My only gripe about the film is the lack of communication or importance of some supporting characters. I guess the primary focus was Prof. X & Magneto's beginnings, but this did make up for whatever the movie lacked. This is what I call a perfect rebound from the 2 previous 'less-than-good' X-Men films.
B006DICWUE|4.0|The first thing that The stars are indifferent to astronomy evokes is nostalgia. Not in a good or a bad way, just a nostalgia for the past, for a decade when a song without consequence about high school kids was all one needed to be, well, popular. This is a record about the passing of time, and from the first note one knows already that it will be an ageless treat.  Nada Surf have learned to accept the maturity that comes with age. Unlike some of their contemporaries, they only glimpse back to pick what they can recycle and improve, instead of regressing. Their story as a band is that of their scene peers, and probably one of the most tangible examples of the current situation of independent rock.  Matthew Caws' voice sound as jovial as always, but there is an omnipresent sense of content. Bassist Daniel Lorca and drummer Ira Elliott, along with guest guitarist Doug Gillard, match perfectly and make their signature style soar, as the record plays without sounding tiresome or repetitive.  \\"Now I've grown up / I wondered what was that world I was dreaming of\\" Caws sings on lead single When I was young, which is emblematic in so many ways. There is no stopping the easiness with which they sail through ten tracks that aim deeper than they seem. All around there are hints at the good old times (\\"it is never too late for teenage dreams\\" he shares in Teenage dreams), but they do not get lost in the past, they are simply looking through the glass and moving forward.  For a band that never quite took off as a mainstream act, a band that has been labeled as a one hit wonder, Nada Surf are resilient and seem perfectly unaffected by it. I disagree with what some journalist declares, that their star burns rapidly; I believe that they still got plenty of fuel left and their live shows are proof of that.  This being their sixth studio album in twenty years of career is a reminder that they craft each one with care, influenced by their musical heroes but also haunted by their constant awareness that things can turn for the best or the worst, and it is all in their hands.

0525478817|5.0|I have been a longtime fan of John Green and his other wonderful books. However, none of them quite took a hold of me like The Fault In Our Stars did. It was so incredibly moving, romantic, whimsical, tragic and honest. I fell in love with these characters within the first couple of chapters as felt for them up until the end. This book had me laughing out loud and sobbing in front of complete strangers.  Fantastic job, John. You truly are a writer gifted to tell the tale of witty, loving, honest teenagers who truly make you feel something.

B001I0T92Q|5.0|I got this on Amazon.co.jp personally. I highly recommend making sure that the adapter you are getting is genuine, there are plenty of fakes out there and I have head more than a few stories about fakes doing everything from plain not working to melting...<br /><br />Pros:<br />much cheaper alternative to memory sticks (currently $25each for 32gb microSDs, $150 for 32GB mem stick pro duo)<br />adjustable memory size<br /><br />Cons:<br />somewhat flimsy (perfectly fine once you have both slots filled by MicroSD cards)<br />need to know what you are doing<br /><br />I personally bought this for my PSP3000 I bought in Japan along with a pair of 32gb class 4 micro SDs.<br />Some people might run into problems using more than 32GB with the adapter and I will tell you both the reason and the fix.<br /><br />If you are running into problems, there are a couple things to keep in mind. If the problem cannot be fixed by the short troubleshoot that comes in the case, it might be the one I ran into.<br /><br />PSPs only recognize FAT32 formatted drives, and the formatting the PSP does by itself often does not format the stick right.<br /><br />another thing, Windows does not allow you to format anything larger than 32gb into FAT32.<br /><br />Some signs that you might be having the same problem as me:<br />PSP cant detect a memory stick<br />unable to format memory stick correctly (format error)<br />only showing 32gb when you have more than 32gb in the adapter<br /><br />the workaround is actually quite simple. I will list it to make it easier:<br /><br />First you need to be able to connect your PSP to your PC, and also go find a program that allows you to format large drives into FAT32, just Google it and you will find more than a few.<br />1)Put your microSD cards in the converter<br />2)Turn on your PSP without having the converter in the mem stick slot to keep the system from freezing.<br />3)connect via USB for your PSP<br />4)push the converter into the slot so it can be read<br />5)use your PC to format the PSP drive into FAT32<br /><br />Done.<br /><br />Hopefully this will help some people, I spent 4 hours scouring the internet to get a fix and couldnt find any working ones, eventually I found out the problem through trail and error.<br /><br />currently using the PhotoFast CR-5400 dual MicroSD to memory stick pro duo adapter + 2x32GB Class 4 Sandisk MicroSD cards in my Japanese Vibrant Blue PSP3000 running 6.60 firmware.<br />Now Im enjoying 60GB of memory in my PSP.<br /><br />Sony claims that the largest amount of memory that a PSP can handle is around 2TB, so you can keep upgrading if you really want to.net to get a fix and couldnt find any working ones, eventually I found out the problem through trail and error.  currently using the PhotoFast CR-5400 dual MicroSD to memory stick pro duo adapter + 2x32GB Class 4 Sandisk MicroSD cards in my Japanese Vibrant Blue PSP3000 running 6.60 firmware.

B004SIP8W0|5.0|My daughter, who is 23 years old now, was the first one to talk me about this movie.  She saw it when she was at Junior High.  Many years ago I watch this movie on TV; and always want it to have it in DVD so I can watch it every time I want it.  Is a movie that really touch your heart.  Is sad, is funny and be prepare to cry a lot.  I recommend it.
B00063F8B2|5.0|I bought this cd because I love the movie, plus it is the only way to get Josh Groban's Believe song. There are a few songs that I don't remember from the movie but we like them also.

B000AGTPUK|5.0|I am a Christmas lover, and a child at heart. The magic Christmas brings always leaves a warm glow, as does this movie. I had always believed that White Christmas would be my favorite movie, then the Santa Clause came out and I really enjoy that series of movies too (who wouldn't with Tim Allen?) but when Polar Express came out my heart sang and I had to have it. I had one copy that got misplaced so I had to buy another this year, I will always keep this movie in my collection.  Do you still believe? Buy this movie and you can't go wrong.

B004EPZ084|1.0|Maybe I should have checked into this movie a little more before watching it, but I thought it had Jennifer Aniston, it should atleast be ok. I was wrong. This movie is about planning murder. Not what I was looking for in a movie that was supposed to be funny. This movie is sick I wanted to turn it off after a few minutes but I continued watching hoping that one of them was just having a dream about this.
B003YUC2FE|3.0|I purchased this set because it included all 3 DVD's and blu-rays which is what we wanted. I don't like the packaging that they came in. The toy box is a cute box, but it will definitely not last. I almost wish I would have purchased the individual blu-rays because at least the discs would be protected.
0525478817|5.0|This is honestly the best book I have ever read.  I am so inspired now and I have hope about my own life that I never thought to have back.

0142419400|4.0|Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins is a fun contemporary romantic YA. I don't read a lot of fiction where the primary plot line revolves around romance, but like watching a chick flick, every once in a while it just hits the spot. And this book is like that.<br /><br />I felt really bad for Anna when the book first started. Her dad is a best selling author who has decided that to impress his buddies he needs a bigger profile, and more pretentious things to talk about. So, he decides he is going to send Anna to an American boarding school in Paris, France. Without asking her how she feels about it. For her senior year. Anna already has problems with her dad, considering he walked out on them when her brother was a baby and now sends money and not much else and this definitely makes things worse. Her mom can't help her and Anna is bitter, scared and lonely when she first gets to Paris. Her meeting with next door neighbor helps bring her into a new circle of friends, and give her some bearings and this is where her story starts.<br /><br />The characters are very well written, with multi-faceted personalities, flaws, shortcomings, and positive traits in a believable combination. None of these characters are perfect, all of them make stupid mistakes and bad choices, but they all also have many redeeming qualities too. They not only have personality traits, they also have hobbies, preferences and quirks. Like Anna who is almost obsessively neat and absolutely adores movies, especially the classics.  These characters were written as if they were real people. Because the characters were real, the relationships between the characters also felt very real. I hate reading books where the romantic connection consists of a glance across a room, instant hormonal craze, one conversation and BAM! I'm head over heals in love. Things like that don't actually happen. You can't be in love with someone that fast. What you can be however, is in lust. Which is what Anna is when she first meets beautiful boy Etienne St. Clair.<br /><br />But, St. Clair has a long term girl friend, is being crushed on by a mutual friend and is therefore totally off limits. So, she thinks he's totally hott, but doesn't try to make anything happen. They become friends and over time she realizes that Etienne is her closest friend. It get complicated when emotional attachments start to muddy the waters, but Anna is trying really hard to keep her head up, and not cross that boundary line. They toe the line, they nudge it, but they never cross it. Until they do...<br /><br />Although mostly lighthearted in tone and topic, there are serious elements to the story as well. Both Anna and Etienne have problems with their fathers that need resolution, and the book brings up the topics of pain, death, loss and betrayal. It's a credit to the author that each of these topics was handled in a realistic way that enhanced rather than detracted from the story line, and didn't bog the story down. I've read too many books that are supposed to be about one thing and end up getting caught in the black abyss that is the sub plots.<br /><br />I loved this book. I thought it was scads of fun to read, and I'm beyond desperate to visit Paris now. It's always been high up in my top 5 places to visit list, but after reading this book I feel like I needed to be there yesterday. I loved that the author included a lot of touristy sites, as well as places a little more off the beaten path. It made me feel like I could really be there. And man, do I want to go hard core!<br /><br />Although not my usual fare, this is definitely a book I'm glad I read, and one that I wouldn't mind reading again. I was very excited to hear that Perkins has two companion novels in the works. I'm glad that we aren't getting a continuation of Anna's story, because it is over, but that there will be more coming soon from Ms. Perkins. Yay for Anna! :)utiful boy Etienne St. Clair.

B004EPZ03E|5.0|Critics gave this film horrible reviews. They said that it was lazy. Even co-star David Cross called it the worst experience of his life. They were so damn wrong! I went with my two kids to the premier in Mississauga and they loved it! And so did I. I call it the best movie of 2011. The plot flows smoothly, the characters are great, the actors are great, the whole damn thing is great! I actually cried at a part of this film. I will not tell you what part because that will spoil the whole movie! I will for sure buy this combo pack because I believe that this movie is worth seeing over and over again! If you have younger kids they will enjoy this movie because it is the only film out of all three films that is rated G. There are a few suggestive remarks that will probably go over your kids heads. Please buy this combo pack if you have a Blu - ray player and if you don`t, buy the DVD version, and see if you agree with me.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i love this game! can spend hours playing. great time waster. much better than I expected for a free game. cant beat it.
0061989142|5.0|This book is a must have for Lauren's fans. We can never have too much of Lauren Conrad!<br />After watching \\"The Hills\\" a million times in my DVD I still wanted to continue getting ideas from her outfits, makeups, hair styling... and that's waht this book is about. Lots of nice pictures, good taste pieces and great productions. Love it!
1849514003|5.0|Coming from c# web apps as my day job, this iOS programming is challenging to grasp. I have spent the last 2 months going back and forth between easy to use frameworks or learning iOS with Cocos and xCode GUI. The easy to use, pay for, frameworks all have serious issues outside of their example projects and waste more time than just learning Cocos2D and Objective-C where things work correctly. So I have gone back to using xCode again.   I have bought many of the other books on this subject. I have to congratulate that this is the only book out there, out of the many I have tried, where all the examples actually built and worked on the simulator and on the phone without a glitch. All of them. All the other books you are lucky if the examples build without many errors, then if they do they don't display on the simulator or phone. I consider them tax write offs. You really want the examples to work because you can't copy and paste code correctly from ebooks and retyping every last letter is really to no benefit unless you are also learning to type at the same time.  The authoring is right to point and by example. It is a combination of many small examples of how to's.  For example, one of the many things on my bucket list was to be able to drag objects around smoothly using physics and a mouse joint.  That is one of the many small examples in the book. And it actually worked professionally right out of the box.  I have also gone through many Googled up internet examples and most of them are partial, don't work and/or are outdated. Or they were surrounded with too much code not relevant to want you where searching for, hence making it very hard to learn by example.
B005KELS6Q|4.0|I was not surprised that the color of this item would be different then what was pictured. I purchased the Paparazzi Pink and I would describe it more like a coral pink. None the less I expected the color to be a little off but I still think the color is awesome.<br /><br />As for the fit of the Kindle it fits in the case but there is a little wiggle room between the front and back of the kindle. The sides all fit snug.<br /><br />Overall this case does it's job and I don't mind the color.

B004LUS390|1.0|This app repeatedly asks for you to agree to the user agreement, once you accept it, it pops up again within 5 seconds. I own a kindle fire, and the express (free) version worked just fine. Autodesk either needs to fix the app, or refund the $1.99 that this app costs.

B000JSI7C6|2.0|This movie is a disappointment. Cage does his part pretty well, but most others seem unnatural characters, it all seems a bit too fake.  Too many episodes are beyond the limits of credibility. CGI (computer generated imagery) is pretty ridiculous, worse than a first generation videogame, it would have been acceptable in the 1980s but not twenty years later.<br /><br />The merit of the film, nonetheless, is to have publicised a little known aspect of the Pacific War, and it is a tribute to the valor of the Navajo.
0470876417|5.0|This is probably the best book I have ever had and purchased from Amazon until today.  Subject, content, clarity, edit, look, feel... all 10 stars. Every person who has a business or planning to have one MUST buy this book.  I use and remember its contents almost everyday.
B005KELW26|5.0|I actually was gifted this case, only for the Kindle Touch. (It mysteriously disappeared once I had the case for a week, so I couldn't write a review for it there!) I absolutely love this case! I got my Kindle for my birthday/Christmas, and this case was a gift from another family member. It adds a little bulk to the Kindle, and makes it feel a little more like holding a real book. I've dropped my Kindle, although not from great heights, and this case offered a good amount of protection. I don't expect it to prevent much damage if the Kindle is thrown or dropped down a flight of stairs, but I would hope people would take better care of their Kindle than that! The magnetic closure is awesome, and works with the front of the cover folded back as well. I use my Kindle a lot, and in the last 2 months the cover has been folded back and closed repeatedly every day. The case isn't showing any cracking or creases because of this, like I've experienced with similar cases I've had for other products. I would definitely recommend this to friends, and I wish Belkin would make more for the Kindle Touch in other colors, and maybe some designs!
B000W1V5OC|3.0|I really like Nightwish, but this is not what I expected. You could tell that there is quite of bit of lip synching at least in the beginning of most of the songs. Also, some of the music itself was pre-recorded. I was hoping for more of an orchestral accompaniment or at least something to differentiate the music from a studio recording.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|Fifty years after its founding in 1962 (the year Bob Dylan released his first album), Amnesty International continues to do lifesaving work for prisoners of conscience and victims of injustice around the world. In 1977, it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Since the 1970s, Amnesty's Secret Policeman's Ball concerts and records have generated funds for the promotion of human rights and raised awareness of discrimination, state censorship, police brutality, torture, the death penalty, and genocide. AI currently has over three million supporters.<br /><br />As for Bob Dylan, few artists have been offered accolades to match those laid at his feet. He's among the greatest poets of our age, a transformational figure in the history of music. There's not a singer or songwriter alive who doesn't owe a debt to his wit and wisdom, and thousands cover his clever, compassionate songs every day. They line up to perform on albums like this one, and there's a Dylan tribute disc for just about every genre you can name: pop, rock, blues, reggae, country, folk, classical, jazz. While most of these are heartfelt, many are uninspired or insipid, and few are memorable.<br /><br />Fortunately, this four-CD, 73-track compilation is both musical and meaningful. The renowned performers on \\"Chimes of Freedom\\" possess not only ample talent but also a deep feeling for the political and personal messages that Bob communicates. And they clearly support Amnesty International, whose anniversary they celebrate. None of them accepted any money for their work (nor did producers, arrangers, engineers, or studios), thereby maximizing their assistance to AI. The music and the cause mesh perfectly.<br /><br />Nearly all of the tracks are new studio recordings, but Joan Baez, Sugarland, Adele, My Chemical Romance, Dierks Bentley, The Dave Matthews Band, and Marianne Faithfull each contribute previously unreleased live tracks. There are legends like Johnny Cash, Pete Townshend, Sting, Mark Knopfler, Patti Smith, Steve Earle, Elvis Costello, Jackson Browne, Bryan Ferry, Jeff Beck, Lucinda Williams, Taj Mahal, Kris Kirstofferson, Eric Burdon, and Pete Seeger, among others, as well as more recent stars: The Avett Brothers, Raphael Saadiq, Rise Against, My Morning Jacket, Diana Krall, Sinead O'Connor, Ziggy Marley, Lenny Kravitz, Angelique Kidjo, Seal, and many more. And of course Bob himself is here in the form of his original 1964 song \\"Chimes of Freedom.\\"<br /><br />A majority of the acclaimed Dylan anthems are covered, but in over five hours of playing time, there's plenty of room for rarely-heard songs, unusual interpretations, and little-known groups and individuals. Of course, that's a selling point for those of us who like to explore new music. The inclusion of a few performers may irritate those who are not fans (Miley Cyrus, anyone?), yet almost all of them do credit to Amnesty and to Bob's music (with the horrifying exception of Ke$ha, who groans, sobs, and screeches throughout \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right,\\" sounding for all the world like she's taken leave of her senses and embarked on a suicidal bender).<br /><br />The case for this set is a very minimal affair: the four CDs fit into an all-paper package that's about the size of a standard single-CD jewel case. Each disc is contained in one of four panels that fold out. A listing of tracks and artists appears on the inside panels along with a brief historical essay by Sean Wilentz, who is a professor of history at Princeton. There is no booklet.<br /><br />In 1992, Bob Dylan and his legendary contemporaries held the best concert ever produced in his honor: The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration. Many of music's greatest stars expressed love and gratitude for the man and his music: Neil Young, Eric Clapton, The Band, George Harrison, Tom Petty, Roger McGuinn, Stevie Wonder, Lou Reed, Johnny Winter, Ron Wood, Richie Havens, Chrissie Hynde, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, and others. Such a laudatory gathering will never be repeated, but the names on this new compilation provide evidence of Dylan's continuing relevance. Listening to the variety of styles represented reveals the universality of his melodies and lyrics and the pervasive influence he has had on our culture. May it also motivate listeners to lend their support to AI and to human rights.<br /><br />Most of the music is marvelous, the album benefits a great organization, and the price is remarkably low. Don't hesitate. Get it!h a laudatory gathering will never be repeated, but the names on this new compilation provide evidence of Dylan's continuing relevance.

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I'm so sad this series has come to an end! I was recommended by a friend, and in the first book I was taken back by the intensity, but I found myself quickly wrapped up. I'm not normally one to read this kind of book but I'm so glad I did. The connection between Ana and Christian is burning hot! I waited two long months for this one to be released! I just finished and I'm so sad that it's over, I loved the way it ended. I look forward to many more books from E.L. James!

0062059882|5.0|A longtime fan of Neil Gaiman's comic book accomplishments, I decided to give his novels a try as well, starting with American Gods. Flat out, I can say I was floored by this book, and hold it in the regard of one of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br />A tale of mythologies of old and new, the book centers around Shadow, a guy fresh out of jail and plunged into a world turned upside down. Tragedy strikes, and Shadow finds himself going down a road he doesn't know, a path that brings him head first into gods and problems he has never dreamed of. Gaiman crafts a world of fantasy and intrigue that pulls the reader in and doesn't let go until the very end.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is one of the best books on the market, especially now that the Anniversary edition is out. A modern day classic that respects and honors mythology, this is a must read.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I'll keep this review short, as there's plenty of wordy ones already written. I hardly remember book 1. I'll never forget book 2.  And book 3 has a lot of work to do to tie up the story. But the slow and steady development of Kvothe, and his relationships, is so well done I feel like I've grown with the kid. The magic is well placed. There's the right mix of insecurity, humility, and backbone in most characters, and enough back story and research in the \\"laws\\" of the magic, language, and cultures (Yillish story knots, awesome.) to make it very believable.<br /><br />It got a bit rushed in the end, and I worry something will get sacrificed to close in 3 books. So my vote is I'm okay if it goes to 4, 5 or 6.  Just keep it under 15 and stay healthy.
1451627289|5.0|11-22-63 is a time travel story without the physics and threat of temporal anomalies that are prevalent in science fiction novels.  Stephen King tells a terrific story of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.  His attention to the historic details of real people, places and events makes 11-22-63 a treat to read, especially for those us old enough to remember them.
1579128149|5.0|This book is awesome.  I bought it for my daughter (age 10)who is really into science and it is gorgeous!!!  The visual aspect is amazing as it gives clear and highly graphic images of each element.  Then the information is laid out in a comprehensive manner.  I was amazed at how clear the information was especially compared to how I learned about the elements when I was in college, I wish I had had this book back then maybe I would not have had to take chemistry twice ;).
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Every so often, a movie comes out that oozes of coolness. James Dean kind of coolness, Clint Eastwood kind of coolness: it is no easy feat. When a film can visually mesmerize you for the duration of the film, and when you leave the theater, you think \\"wow, that was really good\\", then you know you just saw something special. In 2011, Drive is that movie. Gosling shows that he can be cool, and that he can be much more than \\"that guy in The Notebook\\", and Refn shows that, with his directorial eye and Best Director Award from Cannes, he is one to keep an eye on. Highly recommended.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|Product arrived quickly.  I bought the AS5 in an attempt to get better performance out of an existing (aftermarket) CPU cooler/heatsink.<br /><br />After cleaning the CPU and heatsink with isopropyl alcohol, I applied a rice grain sized drop of AS5 and re-mounted the heatsink.  After firing back up, I immediately saw a 5 degree C drop in idle temp and about a 10 degree drop at max load (using Prime95).  This is without any burn-in time so I hope to squeeze a few more degrees out of this stuff over time.<br /><br />Very impressive.  Also much easier to apply than the thermal grease that came with the heatsink.

B005HSL626|4.0|This is a very fun game!! I play it a ton. The reason for only 4 stars is that this game sometimes unexpectedly closes out on me. But I still love it.

B004P98QZ8|5.0|The toy is great. The fire temple is awesome. But can be frustrating at times. If you don't have a lot of experince in building legos I would strongly recomend not purchasing this product. I don't think experince in megablocks would be helpful now unless of course it was megablocks halo or something similar to legos. If you are buying this just for the dragon don't even waste your money it may look cool and I agree it does put it is just for display and that is it period. And let me tell you why, the dragons arms are very hard to build and then when you finally get done it is heartbreaking to see all your work just break a part. And it is just strait anoying. If on the other hand you are buying it for the temple or weapons or ninjas includin Nya, Kai, Sensei Wu, Samukai, Garmodon, Or Zane you won't be dissapointed. The teple takes abut one to two days to build with experince. It works just like it is supposed to. The only flaw I think that could have been improved is that when you put the sword in the slot and the temple is closed when you pull on the it the temple splits in half and there is no retreat button I mean yeah sure you can press the green buttons on the side but then you have to flip the black tab but remember you can;t let go of the green buttons otherwise the rubber will slingshot one side of the temple and it is at risk of breaking something off that side ofther side of the temple.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its a fun game, kinda addictive. Like it when they ask you to download stuff to get points, its a good strategy and it works!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The game is really fun but it is tricky and challanging on some of them. I love it though. It is expecially hard when you do the same one more than once. A lot of them are hard by themsevles the first time. It just gets harder.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|OMG I love this game!!!!!!!!!!! I think you should create more sports games like golf baseball tennis and basketball and way more cool games and that's it for my review hope you use some of my ideas thank you good bye
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Would be a better challenge if the game stayed running - as it is its just frustrating when you get part way into a game &amp; it just goes away.
0062082353|3.0|I discovered the book while browsing through suggestions one night. After reading the sample, I'll say the book is worth the read. I have not read the \\"Sniper Autobiography Genre\\" nor have I read many autobiographies in general.  It's first and foremost a biography; this fact is forgotten by some reviewers who are looking for a study of war, the SEALs, or sniping.  Its a decently written autobiography. The book gets a little repetitive in places. His descriptions of some of the battles and deployments get dry and I think some of them could be forgotten.  I enjoyed that there were contributions from his wife. There's always another side of your story, and it's nice to have that. I was annoyed that his wife's passages were inserted at random, it seemed. Though valuable insights, her parts had no connection to the story before or after, so it was a little disjointed.  The writing isn't fantastic, but I wasn't expecting it to be. He doesn't pretend once to be anything other than a soldier. There's a blunt simplicity that makes the author credible, and a tad cocky. He doesn't refer to Iraqis as savages or despicable creatures. However, he is honest with himself and you that the insurgents were savages. He backs up that claim with stories about women with grenades, men using their sons as human shields, and boys sent to recover RPGs.  The author never claimed, in this book, that he punched Jesse Ventura. I finished the book ten minutes ago and figured out who he punched from the comments.  This isn't a book that glorifies war, worships death, or supports a political agenda. Its the story of the sniper with the most confirmed kills. If you're interested in the story of that man, read the book. I bought It Saturday night and just finished it. I enjoyed the book for the story that the author told.
B004FOA84A|5.0|awesome game. it seems like most of the complaints say that it is too short. but it's. only 99 cents, so that's. what I expected.  hope they produce more games like this.
1597801585|3.0|Many other excellent reviews are available, so I'll just contribute my experience. I would recommend this book, but only with a few caveats.  I find Bacigalupi's vision of future Bangkok amazing. The book has left me with plenty to think about in terms of morality, science, and government.  In terms of literary execution, however, I was unimpressed. Bacigalupi's prose clunks along; his occasional embellishments feel forced. His characters are flat and their internal monologue is often un-believable. I agree with other Amazon users' criticisms about repetition and unnecessary usage of foreign words.  I found the plot pacing a bit slow for most of the book, but the ending went a long way towards changing my opinion. The book builds slowly and steadily towards a coup, and Bacigalupi's description of that coup is excellent. It takes up the final 1/3 to 1/4 of the book, and I'm glad I stuck it out through the clunkier passages. It was some of the best, most believable material in the book.  In summary, I would recommend this book on its merits as a well-executed vision of the future, but I would caution readers that its prose and style is not quite at the level one might expect from an award-winning book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|interesting and entertaining. its nice to find an app that can be played for longer than one day and that doesn't require money to advance.
B005POK858|2.0|This seems like it would be a really fun game; I just wish I could play it for more than 3 minutes at a time. The sound constantly goes out after starting the app, and if I try to adjust the media volume, it shows up as the ringer volume and the phone reboots. Wish this would get fixed.

B005DC68NI|5.0|I'm a traditionally published author who's about to make the leap to do-it-yourself digital publishing. This e-book was a gift from a writer friend and I can't thank her enough. Thank you, K., and thank you David Gaughran! You've told me everything I needed to know and in such a clean, lively, enjoyable style that reading it was a pleasure. Special thanks for the testimonials, the resources at the end, and the fact that you've included information specific to non-US writers. I continue to be astounded and overwhelmed by the generosity of authors I've met and read online over the past few years.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|On the download page it says that the \\"Wi-Fi Download Only\\" version is compatible with the Transformer Prime.  I would have to disagree.  it has been locking up and freezing ever since I've downloaded it.  It flat out doesn't work, a waste of $3....
B002BWP49C|3.0|Bella drives me friggin nuts with her lack of enthusiasm - could have had a mannequin play the part. But that isn't what my review is about. There are many scenes in the movie that a parent could (and should in my opinion) discuss with their child (presuming they are old enough to understand). Obsession, lack of respect for parents (father mostly), running away, lies, taking extreme chances to learn if \\"he\\" loves me (her cliff jumping to the water), being possessiveness of another person, I could go on and on. These all present wonderful opportunities to openly discuss with your son/daughter about what they are watching and (unfortunately) learning in the movie - good discussions about how incorrect the scenes are and why. Whether the children are male/female doesn't matter as each should not behave the way these characters do. Why 3 stars - well the movie isn't a complete disaster, I do love the scenery.

B005AAVFDQ|5.0|I didn't get mine off here, but I was just wondering if anyone else had the same problem as me - product double sealed, but I open it and about 20 pages are creased or have a bend in them. Kind of looks like something happened in production? I'm taking it back to the store, but just thought maybe a warning, or if anyone else had this problem?
B001JAFYFG|5.0|great movie, came on time . can't waite for my next order.shipped in a timley mannor and recieved in great condition.
B00008OE4W|1.0|I don't typically order DVDs online, but this one was back-ordered at Movie Stop for 6 weeks, so I took a leap of faith.  To my disappointment, upon watching the DVD I realized it has several parts where it skips entire scenes.
B0061TQBRK|5.0|So far I am really hooked on 2 of the tracks on this album, and the rest are growing on me. END OF TIME and Lacuna Coil's version of LOSING MY RELIGION are both infectious and powerful. This is a great group with a load of talent. The 2 male vocalists and the female singer combine powerfully on the R.E.M. song, Losing My Religion , and give a great song a very cool different feel and texture. Highly recommend this CD.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I love this format of series collection.  The series itself is well written and the acting great.  Really enjoyed all the extras that came with the DVDS, especially the Guide to cultural references.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|When I first bought the headset last April, it worked like a charm. The sound was great and it really enhanced my gaming experience. The audio feels like it got intensely amplified with these headsets. You can even pick up sounds you've never heard before(such as crickets chirping or the wind). I thought I would be set, but this is not really the case.  Over the span of about 4-5 months, the sound quality on the left earphone experienced a notable drop. It was still good, but now there was a slight imbalance in the audio equilibrium. At the same time, the cord got tangled, likely due to the positioning of the cord whenever I used the clip-on feature of the audio adjustor. Where, may I ask, are you suppose to clip on the adjustor without getting the cord tangled? If you clip it on your pants pocket like I did, the cord tangles. Clipping it on your shirt pocket feels awkward and the cord is even more likely to bend.  Fast forward 9 months from the day of purchase and here we are at my current situation. The left earphone no longer produces audio unless I fiddle with the cord. At this point, it's only gonna get worse. I am considered one of the \\"lucky\\" ones with this product as many people cited left earphone failures as early as 2 months.  So overall, the headset performance is good, but the product really suffers from poor quality as the cord likes to get tangled (unless you choose not to clip the adjustor to anything at all) and the left earphone is known to break one way or another. Maybe if the headset was cheaper, I wouldn't mind so much. But for $65, you would expect the product to last at least two years. I barely got 3/4 of a year, and many of my friends didn't even get half a year's worth of a lifespan.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Many translations; easy to search; excellent interface. And best of all, it's God's Holy Word. The best app on my phone. I don't even carry my Bible to church anymore.

B003UYV08E|3.0|Rourke should of gotten more screen time. The story was all over the place. Felt like they were focusing on many other things besides Iron Man. Anyone else find the F/X not up to par with the 1st? Seemed rushed, maybe it's just me.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a fun game to play. I have mastered one suit, now just trying to find the patients to add another!
B006DICWUE|5.0|As a long-time Nada Surf fan, I would say this is the perfect album at the perfect time.  \\"Clear Eye Clouded Mind\\" is a driving opening song that evokes the sound of \\"Do it Again\\" or \\"Concrete Bed,\\" but is more upbeat and fast-paced -- and modern.  Here we find the title of the album (\\"The stars are indifferent to astronomy\\") in a declaration of the ultimate expression of individuality.  This song could be an anthem for anyone swimming against the mainstream.  Not full of angst.  Full of affirmation.  \\"Waiting for Something\\" could be the catchiest \\"ditty\\" on the album.  \\"When I was Young\\" has been available for some time as a free download so many fans have heard it, of course.  It is one of the more atmospheric tracks, and a solid entry.  This, along with \\"Let The Fight do the Fighting\\" are two of the slower, more pensive songs.  The latter, by the way, was the track a friend who is not familiar with Nada Surf singled out as a favorite after listening.  That brings me to the point that this album is a GREAT gateway into the Nada Surf sound for friends who haven't been around for the duration.  Throw it on the car stereo during 38 minute drive, and I guarantee your passengers will ask, \\"Who is this?!\\"  \\"Jules and Jim\\" and \\"The Moon is Calling\\" are both solid, fresh tracks that ensue the middle of the album isn't \\"filler\\" (Nada Surf doesn't make \\"filler\\").  Like so many other Nada Surf songs, these two will have you emulating Matthew's harmonic vocals (good luck!).  \\"The Moon is Calling\\" reaches for a few more beautiful, lifting crescendos, while \\"Jules and Jim\\" has a paced, tip-toe approach to some of the loftier moments in the song.  \\"Teenage Dreams\\" is a marching manifesto of following your dreams.  Its power is sublime.  \\"Looking Through\\" -- am I about to say it again? -- is catchy as hell!  (\\"Are you dancing?  Are you dancing at all~l~l?\\")  Upbeat and airy, somewhat akin to \\"The Way You Wear Your Head\\".  \\"No Snow on the Mountain\\" will have your feet tapping thebeat within ten seconds.  And just when you think it has settled in, here come Matthew's lifting vocals, a slight variation in the timing, and just another memorable Nada Surf tune that finds it way into your head and heart.  The album ends with \\"The Future,\\" which I personally think is the ONLY even marginally weak song on the album.  It's fast and it's fine, but it seems a little hollow for what we expect from a band as introspective and full of wonder as Nada Surf.  It's not a bad track -- it just has a lofty bar to meet, and I think it may fall just short of the rest of the album.  Bottom line: If you only like certain Nada Surf moments in time (\\"Inside of Love,\\" \\"See These Bones,\\" \\"Always Love\\") you won't find that dark, churning sound on this album.  Like I said, it is more affirmative than any full album we've seen from Nada Surf.  But if you are a newcomer, this album is the one to let you experience a series of crisp, fresh tracks and begin to appreciate all of the dimensions that Nada Surf encompass.  Finally, if you are a fan who likes virtually every song they have recorded, you will find more than a handful of new treasures here.  \\"The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy\\" is Nada Surf's most approachable, upbeat, lively album, and needs to be played for all your friends!

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have been looking for a calendar that does more than be a calendar and I found it finally! The developer makes me so happy, I hope he knows.

I needed to make a long memo for certain days, not just an appointment and this app rocks! I also like that you can make a to do list instead of a memo or an appointment. A today view with all of the things that are due today would be great. I am willing to pay for it. Tasks and memos should be able to be on the TODAY screen.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't care what some people say about this particular book in the Hunger Games series.  I loved it!  It was the best book I have read in a very, very long time.  Some people died, some main characters, but people die in the world, and this isn't the kind of book that would hide that.  In Percy Jackson and the Olympians, when a certain character died, I didn't exactly burst into tears, but that's ok, because that was a different kind of book.  This a more serious type of book, and if you rate this badly because a few characters die, then, well, grow up.  -Griffin

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this book (and the additional two others) simply because I saw the trailer for the movie. I usually prefer books to movies, and this was no disappointment! The Hunger Games was riveting, emotional, and perfectly written. I will write a separate review for the other three, but overall this book was the very best in the Trilogy.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This was part of my gift to my wife. I bought her a Kindle Fire so of course it needed a cover or something. I found this and thought it would compliment my gift very well. Since she's into collecting old books and such, this would be perfect.  Product was shipped rather quickly and as soon as she opened it, fell in love with it completely. The faux leather is pretty awesome and the Fire fits in there very well. Great product and an excellent cover for all those who require one for a Kindle Fire. Kudos to the manufacturer and Amazon.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire is book two in The Hunger Games Trilogy, and to be honest it was not as good. I continued reading because Book 1 had me so hooked I really needed to know what happened. Overall, this installment was a little boring and it had me wishing the author would make a decision about who Katniss would be with and get it over with. I knew from the first book who it should be, but Ms. Collins keeps drawing it out for some reason.<br /><br />On to my final review :)
1595828095|5.0|I love Bernie Wrightson's work, moreso, I love everything he did from his days at DC, up to and including Frankenstein. His mastery of pen, brush and ink is astounding.   I've collected this guy's stuff for years, and was happy to see this volume by Dark Horse, who are doing an admirable job with the Warren material. I found it rather odd to include work that was only Bernie's by the ink job. (Dick Swift, Country Pie & Reuben Youngblood), but if they were to include collaborations, why not include The 2 page Believer he did with Jeff Jones from Vampirella #33? (That could be because of Harris comics owning the Vampi name, though...)   He also drew the characters for Bill Dubay's werewolf game in Creepy #57, and they left out a frontis...Wrightson did an illustration on both inside covers of Creepy #67, and the back cover (backis?) is Uncle sitting on an oversize human head bidding farewell for now to the readers.   Enjoy, as it's a wealth of fine artistry at a budget price!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This final book starts out a little slow for me. Katniss has no intentions of stepping up to the plate, and while this is in key with the fact that she never wanted anything to start at all, it still just made me irritated. After all that fighting for survival and WINNING, for her to not be changed and essentially remain the same narcissistic, angst ridden child is unbearable. It does draw the contrast between Gale- who is ready for war, and Peeta- who has always been more of a lover than a fighter. In the end, I realized that Katniss seems to only pull strength from Peeta and her family. This is all she cares about, and only harm or potential harm to them can mobilize her.  This ending was a little anticlimactic emotionally, but the author does us the favor of letting a little Katniss-tough shine through with a few action-packed chapters.
0312641893|5.0|Pick up this book!  Pick it up now, or better yet do not.  Let me save you some agonizing, because if you read this book you are only going to be left begging for the next book which is not yet on shelves.  The book tells the tale of Cinder, who is not your ordinary Cinderella.  She is from our world, in the future where everything has changed.  You will still see the evil step mother and step sisters and prince charming but it is the diaglog and the additional story lines about the Lunars and the fate of earth as a plague threatens all of our people, the politics of a royal marriage that will really draw you in and let you know that this book is like no other you have read before.  Pick it up!

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief: How do you review a book that made you smile, made you cry, made you marvel at the human spirit? I guess it is going to be tough but here is my attempt at it anyways.<br />'The Book Thief' by Markus Zusak is labelled as YA - well, this is definitely also for adults and for anyone who loves books. It took me forever to get to reading this book but once I started I could not stop reading, and when I was done, I wanted to keep reading it. While 'The Diary of Anne Frank' gives you a sense of how the Jews fared during this horrible time, this story is about how little German girls and their families fared in Nazi Germany. Could they voice their opinions? What would happen if they did? These and many other questions find their answers in the book in Zusak's powerful and beautiful words. Zusak's description of people, of the sky, of the war are all going to stay with me for a long time.<br />The story: 'The Book Thief' follows four years of Liesel Meminger's life as she arrives at the doorstep of her foster parents after a close encounter with Death as he comes to take her little brother on their way to Himmel(Heaven) Street where the Hubermans (the foster parents) live. Narrated by Death himself, Liesel's life as a book thief starts at the beginning when she steals her first book, 'The Gravedigger's Handbook' at her brother's funeral. Death, being Death, and Liesel being in Nazi Germany cross paths multiple times in the book. Learning the power of words courtesy of her wonderful new dad, Hans Huberman, using the not so appropriate first stolen book, she goes on to 'acquire' more books with her best friend and partner in crime, Rudy Steiner - a boy with \\"hair the colour of lemons\\" who idolises the black Olympic champion sprinter Jesse Owens. When Max Vandenburg, a Jew, comes to hide in their basement, the Hubermans prove many times over that the human values of kindness, love, compassion and sheer strength of spirit exist. Max's arrival means a major change in the course of Liesel's life. Death's narration of the story brings in a 'fresh' perspective of Nazi Germany.<br />The characters: I cannot decide whom to love more in this book - Liesel, Hans, Rudy, Max, Rosa, or even Death himself! Other secondary characters are also portrayed strongly and very well in this book. Death is almost human in this book - he comes to care, he stomps, he holds souls gently in his hand. Liesel and Rudy's (along with other friends) ability to enjoy the small pleasures of childhood (playing soccer on the street, sharing stolen apples) they are granted in the midst of the war and the human spirit that shines through the characters (even Death) keeps this book from being totally depressing.<br /><br />If I could give a higher rating for this book, it would have been off the charts!course of Liesel's life.

B006G2ZEV6|2.0|I installed this on my transformer prime running ICS and have experienced really annoying problems where I can't see any text. The graphics look amazing, but it's hard, if not impossible, to play all the way through without the text. Additionally, after a certain number of textless prompts, I have the game lock up or crash. I wish the developers would look into this, especially since other people seem to be having similar problems.
B0049P1ZZQ|2.0|I got through the first season (with a lot of fast forwarding after the first episode).  The first episode was good, but my fear came to be realized, 90% of each episode being nothing but people sitting around talking to each other about their zombie problems.  And after the first show, the zombies are lame and almost non-existent.  I supposed since it's TV, they want to keep their budget low, hence fight scenes/zombies become less frequent.  Final episdoe of season 1 had to be the worst - talk talk talk and you saw about 30 seconds (literally 30 seconds) of zombies.  WTF ?  I won't be buying season 2.

B005CMSDLE|4.0|Hanna is a coming of age story.  It starts off with great potential.  Once Hanna enters the world that she has never known she operates easily in it for the most part but has difficulties with other things.  What she does not understand about the world she never knew is not consistent.  She should either have known more or much less.  This inconsistency provides confusion.  There is plenty of action.  Hanna is a likeable character.  It is good entertainment if you do not want to take it too seriously.
B004A8ZWW4|2.0|From the cloying inspirational soundtrack to the Kinkaide-inspired amber sunsets; to the big eyed precocious kid who is so much more smarter than the adults around him, to the sentimental beautiful girlfriend who hopes her would-be boyfriend grows up. The only thing this movie was missing was a scruffy dog. And 'Atom The Robot' comes awfully close to that.<br /><br />I wasn't looking for some kind of hardened combat-to-the-death flick, but this static predictable sugarfest had me wistful for a dose of German avant-garde experimental film - and I detest German avant-garde experimental film.<br /><br />Would've been much more enjoyable had the filmmakers taken a slightly darker edge, placed the characters in a slightly more challenging plot. And importantly, hired a less adorable, less smarmy adult-sounding kid. Every time he uttered, \\"I got this\\", I wanted to puke.<br /><br />No point in really doing an in-depth review - how hard is it to figure this one out?<br /><br />As it stands, it's the robot reboot of the 1987 Sylvester Stallone flick \\"[[ASIN:B0007TKNKG Over the Top]]\\". And that movie was terrible. And speaking of Sly - he ought to sue the producers for ripping his [[ASIN:B002M9WW30 boxing franchise]] off. Cinematographic plagiarism at its worst.<br /><br />Want robots and a really fun ride? Rewatch one of 'The Transformers'. I know I will.<br /><br />Movie Note: One plothole that had me confused - how does \\"underground\\" robot fighting work? I mean, the open public competition already has them destroying/killing one another. So what exactly would be the dark side of this sport? Getting sodomized by the winning robot?<br /><br />Actually, that would've made this movie more interesting. Talk about an incentive to win. &lt;g>

B000NH7SZ0|5.0|I am so thrilled right now!  I took a chance after reading other success stories with HP LaserJet printers and purchased this memory upgrade instead of the HP recommended module on their web site.  I powered on my HP P2055dn, browsed  to the device configuration page and it said \\"DIMM: Slot: 256 MByte RAM DIMM\\".  I have printed a few basic files, but no large PDFs or anything memory intensive yet, but it does seem to be slightly faster from queue to print time on my Mac Mini.  We use this printer in an office environment with 15 users total.  With this memory module installed in this duplexing printer -  [[ASIN:B0019L0X38 HP LaserJet P2055dn Printer Monochrome]], the number of people we have printing large PDFs, and the auto-duplex feature that works amazingly fast,  I can't think of a better deal.  I am VERY satisfied!
B005K17RU0|5.0|love this ap. it's unobtrusive and has the info you need up to 15 days. you can have favorite cities also. i've tried 2 other weather aps and this is by far the best.
1423136802|5.0|My 8 year old daughter loves this series.  By the way, she is a VS (very strong) gifted student, who has read many books far above grade level.  She adores these books, because they are just plain entertaining.  She loves history, and I must say it is very interesting how many references there are in the world to this old mythology.  She finds it very relevant in her life.  I read these books also (as my daughter greatly enjoys being able to talk about the books together), and I found I couldn't put them down.  Several kids in her school are also reading this series, and it has made them close friends, as they discuss the books.  WONDERFUL!!!  There is not a better feeling in the world, then to lose yourself in a good book.  Not everything needs to have some deep hidden inner meaning....after all, most people (myself and my children included) enjoy reading to escape from reality for just a short time.
B006PTL1QM|4.0|Putting aside some minor historical and biographical inaccuracies, \\"A Dangerous Method\\" is a marvelous film, with a bravura performance by Keira Knightly. The focus of the film is the relationship between two of the great founders of modern psychological theory, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.<br /><br />Freud (1856-1939) was an Austrian Jew who developed the Psychoanalytic method as a result of his work in neurology and his experiments with Mesmerism (hypnosis). He published the first of many books in 1899 and this attracted the attention of dozens of intellectuals, including Carl Jung (1875-1961), a Swiss Psychiatrist.<br /><br />Jung approached Freud in 1906 and their relationship lasted for approximately 7 years.<br /><br />When they met, Freud was 50 and Jung was 31. Freud was a Jew and Jung was a Swiss Reformed Evangelical. Freud was 5'7\\", Jung was 6'1\\". Jung's experience was largely based in institutions and Freud was primarily a private physician. Freud lived comfortably but was never well off. Jung had been poor as a child but married one of the wealthiest women in Switzerland. Freud was known for being faithful to his wife and Jung was well known for his affairs, one of which is the focus of the film.<br /><br />Keira Knightly plays Sabrina Spielrein (1885-1942), a former patient of Jung with whom he had an affair. Knightgly is the Natalie Portman look-alike who played the decoy Queen in Star Wars (1999). From this humble beginning she went on to earn an Oscar and a Golden Globe nomination for \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (2005) and has been in such box office hits as the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" franchise and \\"King Arthur\\" (2004). As the conflicted and vulnerable Russian Jewess, this is by far her best performance and one of the best performances by anyone.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen plays the cigar smoking Freud (who ultimately developed cancer of the jaw). Mortensen is best known for his \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films as well as some stunning work in films like his Oscar nominated role in \\"Eastern Promises\\" (2007) and \\"A History of Violence\\" (2005). His work in this film earned him a Golden Globe nomination. He is marvelously understated.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender plays Jung. Fassbender is best known for his work in \\"Inglorious Bastards\\" (2009) and his Golden Globe nominated \\"Shame\\" (2011). He does a good job acting, but he lacks the stature of Jung who towered over (at 6'1\\") his contempories.<br /><br />David Cronenberg directs. Cronenberg is known as the \\"Baron of Blood\\" for films such as \\"Scanners\\" (1981), \\"Videodrone\\" (1983), \\"The Dead Zone\\" (1983) and \\"The Fly\\" (1986). He worked with Mortensen on \\"A History of Violence\\" (2005) and \\"Eastern Promises\\" (2007).<br /><br />The beautiful on location photography is courtesy of Peter Suschitzky who is a long time collaborator with Cronenberg and who also has to his credit films as diverse as \\"Valentino\\" (1977), \\"Mars Attack\\" and \\"The Man in the Iron Mask\\". The excellent musical score is from Howard Shore whose most familiar work is \\"Lord of the Rings\\" for which he won 2 Oscars and 3 ASCAPs. and who also gave us memorable work in \\"Big\\", \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", \\"Philadelphia\\", and \\"Se7en\\".<br /><br />It's hard to make a compelling movie about such an academic topic as the differences in emphasis between Freud and Jung, and there a few good films about the history of psychology. Montgomery Clift's \\"Freud\\" (1962) and the Australian film \\"Between the Wars\\" (1974) are examples that this can be achieved, and here we have another fine example.<br /><br />There are some problems with the film. The influence of World War 1 on Freud's death theory is ignored as is Jung's unflattering complicity with the Nazis. The use of Otto Gross as the only other analyst in the film makes one think that early Psychoanalysis was permeated with sexual perverts, when in fact there were many people involved who were there for the intellectual and humanitarian purposes.<br /><br />Another problem with thefilm is that the enormity of Freud's message is not really portrayed adequately. In 1900, the idea that our behavior was controlled by unconscious impulses was revolutionary, and as much of a problem for Freud as his sexual theory, yet the two were intertwined. The film's focus on the sexual theory doesn't do justice to the complexity of Freud's theory nor to how controversial it was.<br /><br />The film also underplays the importance that Jung's role as a non-Jew had to the \\"movement\\" and how much anti-semitism was at play for a theory that seemed to be rooted in intellectual Jewish culture.<br /><br />Critics were divided in assessing the film. Roger Ebert called the film \\"absorbing\\" and said Mortensten's performance was \\"masterful\\". The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"precise, lucid and thrillingly disciplined\\", but Rene Rodrigues of the Miami Herald called the film \\"crushingly dull\\".<br /><br />The film was released in late November and earned nearly $4 million in the first month, which placed it 165 for all films released in the previous year. It had an estimated budget in excess of $20 million.<br /><br />Bottom line - fans of biographies and anyone with an interest in Psychoanalysis will find this film very entertaining and informative, but for the ordinary film goer it may be too much talking and not enough action.film is that the enormity of Freud's message is not really portrayed adequately.

142312166X|5.0|My 8 year old daughter absolutely loved the Percy Jackson series.  In fact, she enjoyed it even more then the Harry Potter books (although having read both series, I find them different enough not to bother with comparison).  This little book gave a few quick, short stories from the perspective of other characters (who you also come to know while reading the series), and additionally, it has fun interviews and a few games.  My daughter made copies of the word search, crossword puzzle, and map for her school friends who have also been reading the series.  They were delighted!
0142410373|5.0|When I ask my five year old what her favorite chapter book is, she replies with \\"Matilda\\" every time.  Roald Dahl was my favorite when I was a kid, so I couldn't be happier my daughter loves his work as much as I did.  Dahl makes books fun. Next up is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!
B001UV4XWY|5.0|This movie is worth even more than 5 stars! I'm going to make this review straight to the point, but yet, \\"brief\\" The reason why is because: Manytimes, regardless of how much a review is broken down and expressed to the readers of that review. Ultimately, as to rather if a movie gets purchased then liked or not, solely depends on what the purchaser looks for in a movie! For instance, I could brag about this movie all day long! Because it had/has all of the elements which I happen to deeply respect!  Now these elements which I highly respect in it are: The Highly Metaphysical,The Highly Mystical, It possesses certain \\"Esoteric\\" content. When dealing with the mystery man's essence accompanied with his associations/workers/contacts. Along with the main 2 couples later connection involvement. Though alot more could be said about this wonderful treasure found! One still finds it more fair for the reader of this review to make their own decision about the movie if they choose to purchase it. I'll just say this much: Any purchaser who in which either studies Metaphysical Literature,Mysticism,Esoteric Literature, Etc; Well, such a person as this'll deeply respect this movie to the fullest!  And a purchaser who in which has experienced or does experience- The Realm Of Metaphysics,Mysticism,Esoteric Insight,Etc; Well,such a person as this'll both deeply love and respect this movie! \\"By One\\" looking at this beyond just being interpreted as just another movie. They can possibly gain more profound insight! Before haphazardly making a wrong choice in life- which can cost a person everything- When dealing with the veil of the unseen.  P.S. This movie is for those who can respect its profound message involved! It's \\"One Of The Best Movies\\" to ever be made! It far exceeded my expectations!
0307588343|5.0|BUY THIS BOOK!  I wasn't sure what i was getting when i ordered this book. It could have been a 'pity me' type story..but is isn't. The writer opened my eyes to the various aspects of the Sub-Prime loan debacle. (I still call it a scam). It shows the perfect storm that developed between an inept & corrupt Washington and the banking/Wall Street system. He writes about the Fed's suing banks who would not make the stupid loans that they knew couldn't be repaid. He explains the mistakes that were made..the analysis that was ignored both by Barney Frank's committee and the greedy lenders. The borrowers and the scheming lenders who defrauded the system. This problem took forty years to finally burst and cripple the economy.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I don't know what the bad reviews are about, I received this bag and questioned the quality of the bag because of the low reviews but after checking the bag out I came to the conclusion that the bag is super great, durable, and I would totally recommend this bag. It is worth the price of only $40 bucks. It has good quality and I checked the zippers and straps for cheapness/poor quality in product and put togetherness and they all seem fine to me. Maybe if you're really, really hard on the bag it might not hold up but I would totally recommend it 100%.

B006UAWH2S|4.0|I heard of this movie randomly & thought I would give it a try. I'm very glad that I did. This is one of the most unique disease gone awry films that I have ever seen. Ewen McGregor & Eva Green play two people who happen to meet & fall in love right when a worldwide pandemic occurs that slowly takes away peoples senses. It's hard to describe because I found this movie had romance (but not the mushy sappy kind), a dash of creepiness & sadness because of how the disease affects the human race but also I found it to be a really hopeful movie. It's absolutely different from any film I've seen especially about this topic. Definitely see it, watching it will be better than any way I can try & explain it.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I have a Kindle 3 (keyboard) but at night and when I forget to throw my Kindle in my purse, I like to read on my tablet or phone.  My phone is a 4.5 inch screen, so it is decent for short term reading at doctor's offices or long postal lines.  For that the Kindle app is great.  Now for reading on my 7\\" HTC flyer at night, it is not so good.  The main reason for this is its lack of customization.  I've been using coolreader and FBreader, and have tried several other android readers.  I've pretty much stuck with coolreader.  For long term reading I can... flip pages with either hand/side of the screen, turn the light down to almost none, and choose soothing font colors.  The light is by far the worst part of the Kindle app.  Even with it set on black background with white lettering, on the lowest display setting, it is too bright and leaves lines in my vision after reading.  I end up liking the sepia with black lettering at low light but it is still too bright for a completely dark room.  It is a strain on the eyes.  There are dozens of other settings that these other apps allow that the Kindle app does not, but you have easy access to your Kindle library which is a positive.  I just wish I could turn the brightness down more, flip pages with either hand (I set upper corners to back flip and middle sides and lower corners to page forward), and choose font colors, and then the Kindle app might be the one I would choose.
B006DICWUE|4.0|On this, their sixth album, Nada Surf don't redefine anything, nor do they go \\"back to basics,\\" or express any pretension towards being edgy or relevant. What they do is bash out ten good songs that hang together well, that further illustrate their skillful blend of catchy indie-rock with ridiculously un-cynical lyrics. It's definitely a practice-room record, evident from the opening crash of \\"Clear Eye Clouded Mind,\\" and the generally effortless but decidedly uptempo rush through the rest of the album, through to the dizzying coda of \\"No Snow on the Mountain.\\" \\"Waiting for Something\\" sounds so familiar as to be Nada Surf-by-numbers, but no worries: good tricks bear repeating. The spacey slow burn of \\"When I was Young,\\" the effervescent janglefest \\"Jules and Jim,\\" and the earnest \\"Looking Through\\" are other highlights. The tempo only slows for \\"Let the Fight do the Fighting,\\" a shimmering minor-key gem with a nice trumpet solo and cello that feels like a companion to [[ASIN:B001VEN5IS Lucky]]'s \\"Are You Lightning?\\". This album won't make them favorites of the Pitchfork set, but it is perhaps their most overall upbeat and accessible record, even though it doesn't quite scale the peaks from earlier efforts. It's just another Nada Surf record: sometimes that's more than enough, and huzzah for that.

B006RUJST6|4.0|Disclaimer: I do not know the author personally. I first heard of her book on a writer's forum. A poster created a thread in order to accuse the author of gaming Amazon's system in order to create fake 5 star reviews. The author is new; unknown. Slammed is her debut book. Within seven days of release she managed to gain an unprecedented number of five star reviews. She came across this thread and tried to defend herself. She claimed she utilized the power of social media, as well as gained the support (tweet) of the Avett Brother's band. She also said she wrote the book in a month. I was intrigued and curious by all of this. I decided to read the book in order to give a fair, objective, and balanced review.<br /><br />I confess that I had low expectations for this book. I found it hard to believe that someone could write and publish a book in thirty days and gain all five star reviews. First let me say, I read a lot of young adult books. This is definitely a young adult book, and quite frankly, she did an amazing job (especially considering the amount of time she spent on the book). I was blown away.<br /><br />Is this book perfect? No. Hence -four stars. She writes in the first person, present tense, which is difficult to do, and requires the reader to make a shift. It took me awhile to get comfortable. She did a good job of staying in the present tense, but there were sentences here and there that felt a bit awkward. The book was relatively clean of typos and convention eras (another amazing feat in such a short amount of time). I spotted about three errors that jumped out at me -things like an extra word or capitalization. These minor issues are fixable and do not take away from the story.<br /><br />The characters were strong, compelling, and believable. I was somewhat bothered by Kel's age. Kel is the younger brother of the main character. He is 9 years old, but there were times in which he seemed like he was five or six. His actions, reactions, and interactions with his sister were not typical of a nine year. They were often younger. In fact, I think it would make more sense to the story line if Kel and Caulder (Kel's friend) were younger, especially considering their reaction Kel's mother's secret.<br /><br />The main character is Lake. This story began as a sweet YA romance, but quickly turned into much more. Lake and Will faced an ethical and moral dilemma of such a degree it shut down their relationship, but it did not shut down their feelings. This in itself made me read further to find out how this situation would be resolved. But there was more. Lake's mother had a secret that turned their world upside down. I began to care about Lake and what happened to her. Will was a likable character with a strong emotional appeal. The story moved from sweet to intense, and as a reader, there was no turning back. I had to know how this all turned out, even when it became emotionally difficult to read.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the book was the inclusion of a poetry slam in the story. The poetry the author wrote in the story on behalf of her characters was amazing. The poems added emotional depth to the story and the characters. Everything flowed together beautifully.<br /><br />The author's voice was strong, young, and believable. The characters were well developed and gave the reader an emotional punch. The story ramped up quickly, and by no means left you hanging. Overall, I must say, I think the author is a rising star in YA. I've come to the conclusion that if she used the power of social media, and gave this book away for free to hundreds of young people, I do not find it outside of the realm of possibility that these young adults would give her five star reviews for this book. It is definitely five star worthy. This book needs a bit of tightening and cleaning up, but the average reader probably won't be bothered or even discerning of the minor issues in this book. The story carries itself. I am amazed thatthe author did this in a month. That requires some serious talent, and I will give her the credit she deserves -she is very talented. I recommend this book to young adults (high school and up) and adults alike. The emotional impact of this story will effect you, and make you want to hug your children and parents.alent, and I will give her the credit she deserves -she is very talented.

B005OLUOVA|5.0|This is a great item. There have been a lot of problems with these and Universal is still taking them back in exchange for the defective one.<br /><br />That being said I ordered mine and received it within the last 2 weeks. The steel casings did have a couple of scratches and the cloth inside the set did have some dirty spots. I personally did not have any issues with bad discs or them being in the incorrect order.<br /><br />I will not be sending mine back and wait several weeks for a \\"new\\" one. My problems were extremely small and I am extremely excited to have the set. It is expensive, so you need to ask if you want to spend that much, and if so are you going to send it in for the exchange?<br /><br />This is a die-hard fan item. No doubt about it. DVDs have great quality of video. CD with the actual Best-of album has obvious tweaks to the tunes, all for the better.
B001HN6922|5.0|This was purchased as a gift.  I assume it works fine, didn't get any complaints about it.  Movie arrived new in shrink wrap.
B006VRLNV6|5.0|It's getting annoying, isn't it -- the endless parade of rereleases, remasters, and repackagings designed to bleed music fans with the promise of something new from a long-gone band?<br /><br />Reluctantly, I checked this album out on a streaming service. I wasn't about to part with another dollar to re-re-re-buy this middle-aged album without a good reason. I had the thing on vinyl, for cripes' sake. Then two CD versions, including the \\"Perception\\" box set... and now this.<br /><br />If you don't own a version of this album, and if you like the Doors at all, you must jump on this. And even if you do own a previous version, this edition is well worth it.<br /><br />Why? Well, if you don't own this album, you're missing a major shift in the Doors' direction, from sinuous adolescent psychedelia to boozy desert blues. It's not an easy shift for the listener to make; it took me easily 20 years of Doors fandom to really come around to this album after cutting my teeth on the poppy \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" and the hallucinatory \\"The Soft Parade\\" and all. I get it now. I'm glad I waited it out.<br /><br />And if you do own the album, I recommend you grit your teeth and spring for this edition (perhaps vowing, like me, that this will be the VERY LAST time you pay for this music).<br /><br />Why? First, it sounds great. Bright enough to hear all the instruments clearly, but not so bright that it sounds \\"modern.\\" Let's face it, the warm sound of the music of this era is a major part of its attraction. No weird, forced stereo separation; no strange emphasis on any instrument or vocal; it's just pleasant to listen to.<br /><br />And now -- you need alternate versions? Don't go no further. The second half of this reissue is chock full of truly wonderful alternate takes that I personally had never heard. These are complete takes that stand on their own -- any one of them would have been worthy to be the final take (barring the rather lackluster \\"Love Her Madly (Take 1)).\\" Some of the chatter before the songs is quite amusing as well, especially the cutting up before \\"Riders on the Storm.\\" Given the serious tone of most of the album, it's great to hear a bit of Jim's funny side.<br /><br />As for the two \\"new\\" entries, \\"Rock Me\\" and \\"She Smells So Nice\\"... Well, \\"Rock Me\\" is a cover of the old blues standard, \\"Rock Me Baby,\\" which they often performed live. And the \\"new song\\" that's been so hyped, \\"She Smells So Nice,\\" isn't really a song, more of a loose, drunken jam on a blues theme. On both cuts, the band is ramshackle and Jim's voice is muffled and poorly recorded, and there are audible microphone crackles. I suspect these were warm-up jams that just happen to have been recorded. If you're a huge fan, you may want to get \\"She Smells So Nice\\" anyway, just for fun, but a \\"lost song\\" it ain't.<br /><br />The only thing keeping this from being the definitive, ultimate \\"L.A. Woman\\" issue is the lack of the bonus tracks from the 2007 issue: \\"Orange County Suite\\" and \\"(You Need Meat) Don't Go No Further.\\" Neither was included on the original \\"L.A. Woman\\" issue, but both are real songs (unlike \\"She Smells So Nice\\") and both are worthwhile. I'd go so far as to say they're essential for the Doors fan, especially \\"(You Need Meat),\\" a Willie Dixon cover. It's one of their best latter-day rockers and it really fits in with the rest of the album.

1451627289|5.0|At the outset, when I began the 10 day journey that would become delving into \\"11/22/63\\" I had no preconceived ideas about penning a review. As of late I've found reviews to be a waste of time and energy spent that could be used for putting towards other things. However, it became increasingly more apparent as I plowed through this 849 epic of a novel, that my opinion must be stated.  In my humble and honest opinion, \\"11/22/63\\" is probably the best King novel since [[ASIN:074343627X Dreamcatcher]] and easily the most mature (both thematically and fictionally) since [[ASIN:3404143434 The Green Mile]]. If there is proof that one of America's greatest authors can continuously grow in his ability, the proof is right here.  I've stated this in pretty much all of my reviews so it should go without saying in this one that I love horror novels. It should also go without saying that you can't really be a true fan of horror until you've read some of King's classics, [[ASIN:B002SR2PKG It]], [[ASIN:B0012I8MNQ The Stand By Stephen King]], and [[ASIN:0743437497 The Shining]] just to name a few. I would also wager that while \\"63\\" is not a horror novel, it will go down as a true King classic.  King's subject matter and writing style have changed drastically in the last decade or so, but that shouldn't scare any long-time fans off, because as I just stated, this novel is a true powerhouse and one that shouldn't easily be forgotten.  Gone are the elements that once (delightfully) scared readers, instead they are replaced with characters who you root for, who you mourn with, who you can't help but stay up late into the night with, just to see where they end up and if they will succeed or fail their goals. No longer are we given creepy and bone chilling plots, but instead a truly emotional story, one that (despite it's sci-fi foundations) is believable and should time travel actually be real, plausible. This book may not be the epic fright fests we are used to receiving from \\"America'smaster of horror\\" but it is an epic, nonetheless, and one that is a sure showcase for the talent of King.
0439023521|5.0|one of the best books ive read in the past few years. its full of excitement and way worth reading. i loved it.
0385535139|4.0|When I first started THE LITIGATORS, I thought the old Grisham was back. You know, the guy who wrote THE FIRM and A TIME TO KILL. Well, not so much.  I did enjoy this book, but while it started out really good with some humor thrown in, it bogged down in the middle and seemed to drag quite a bit. At the end, it really picked up steam and was great fun.  I think it could have been better with some drastic editing.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|Was torn between this and the wider beamed Fenix but opted for this. This has proven to be a terrific light. About the size of a 2 x D cell flash light. This little thing packs a real punch in the dark. I would say it is comparable with my 3500 lumen HID.<br /><br />Love the 4 settings. Low is pretty low. Enough light to look around a dark room but not so bright. 2nd setting is great for walking down a dark road - you can see a good distance but wont render you blind when you turn it off. 3rd is where it starts getting bright. Good for distance/presence. High is just impressive. I am sure there are brighter lights on the market but not sure anything using AA's comes close. Add to that the 2 hour run time on high (have not timed it but I am sure it is realistic).<br /><br />I was not wanting to spend as much on a light but have no regrets. Think of it as an investment in dark prevention. This light is not huge which is a real plus.<br /><br />Update 11-9-2012<br />While I still have ZERO cons to report I wanted to add that this light remains as impressive as the day I got it. Super bright, practical size, 100% reliable. I LOVE that it takes AA's and continue to use (and recommend) Enloops. As the batteries run low the light will only activate the highest setting available - working backwards to the low setting. A good heads up that you need to charge!.<br />Love this light and will be looking for another!

B000002OX5|5.0|For me, this is the cream of The Who's crop. From the glorious psychedelia of \\"Armenia City In The Sky\\" to the power pop masterpiece \\"I Can See For Miles\\", \\"Sell Out\\" is a perfect picture of England in the `60's. Humor permeates the album with the sly sexual innuendoes of songs like \\"Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand\\" and the awkward social situations in songs like \\"Odorono\\" and \\"Tattoo\\". The subtle \\"Our Love Was\\" depicts an alternately dysfunctional and idealized affair of the heart. It wasn't until I heard \\"I Can See For Miles\\" as a young boy that I became a fan of the band. I couldn't get enough of that song then and it still sounds like a powerhouse to these aging ears. Other highlights include the sweetly yearning \\"I Can't Reach You\\", the anti-greed message of \\"Silas Stingy\\", the delicate \\"Sunrise\\", snappy \\"Glittering Girl\\", the lyrically dark but melodically light \\"Melancholia\\", the horn-driven tale of forbidden teen love \\"Someone's Coming\\" and several songs that point the way to \\"Tommy\\" including \\"Relax\\", \\"Rael 1\\" and most notably the end of \\"Glow Girl\\".<br />\\"Jaguar\\" highlights Keith Moon's incredible drum playing but is a bit weak compared to most of the album's sturdy songs. The weakest track by far is \\"Hall Of The Mountain King\\", an exercise in silly pointlessness but many bands of the time indulged in that kind of thing for kicks and giggles every now and then.<br /><br />The spot-on mock radio ads (or `jingles' as the older folks like me called them) such as \\"Heinz Baked Beans\\", \\"Medac\\", \\"Radio London\\" and ads for Coke punctuate the first two-thirds of the album, definitely lending a hint of concept to it which Pete Townsend would eventually take to new levels on albums like \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Quadrophenia\\".<br /><br />1967 was a time of great experimentation in rock, with bands like The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, The Velvet Underground (and many others too numerous to mention here) and artists like Jimi Hendrix pushing the boundaries of what that genre of music could sound like and like those artists, The Who was at the forefront of that period of magic.<br /><br />On a related note `alternative artist' Petra Haden (a daughter of the jazz bassist Charlie Haden) released a wonderful, provocative a capella version of the main songs in 2005 called \\"Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out\\" which is definitely worth checking out.ke and like those artists, The Who was at the forefront of that period of magic.

B004132I20|5.0|Sherlock Holmes has intrigued many a generation.  Many will no doubt cherish the original stories, and any deviation of them would be sacrilage in some of those readers' eyes.  However, to the Holmes admirer with an open mind, this is an amazing retelling of the adventures of Holmes and Watson in the 21st century.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are great in their roles of Holmes and Watson, respectively; Sherlock as the odd but clinical rationalist, and Watson as your everyday man learning from Holmes detective work.  What makes this more fun is the intertwining of parts of the Holmes stories in this retelling, so in one respect, you are familiar with some items, but on the other hand, you feel like you are watching a whole new Sherlock mystery.  The first episode, \\"A Study in Pink\\" appears by title and within the first murder to follow \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", but as we go on, we see allusions to different stories, but the final act going on a completely different arc altogether. Steve Moffat and co. have done an excellent job balancing elements of the original stories with a new angle.  The use of 21st century technology also is intriguing in these stories as well.  The use of \\"Holmes-vision\\" here is awesome; think of it as zooming on details with annotations on the details.  The episodes are about 1 1/2 hours long, so think of it as 3 (4 if unaired pilot is counted) Sherlock movies in one package.  Highly recommended!

The Evernote version here at Amazon the time of this review, 3.2.2, dated Sept 2011. The one at the Android App Store? 3.5, dated Jan 2012. Not sure who is to \\"blame\\" (Amazon or the publisher), but as a consumer you need to get your software from a source that will provide consistent updates.  Wish I could remove this free purchase from my list of purchases! It shows as needing an update only because I have the newer version from the Android store (I guess it checks for version mismatches and assumes that if it isn't the same, the one in the store must be newer!)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am a fifteen year old guy who loves reading.  Fantasy is my favorite.  This book deserves the number one ranking it currently has in the kindle store.  i am a diehard reader and finished this book about three hours after buying it.  One of the best books i have ever read (including harry potter and the inheritance cycle).  There are a few scenes that get a little graphic including *SPOILER ALERT*  the main character Katniss being held down and her face cut open deliberately by another girl just  to cause pain, and the same girl having her skull bashed in by a rock.  Also a boy gets mauled by wolves for a whole night, the wolves deliberately working him over to hurt and maim, but not kill him.  *SPOILER OVER*  I recommend for ages thirteen and up.  I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading.  My only small complaint is the lack of character development.  I hope Collins focuses more on the characters next book.  Thanks for reading my review!

B003UESJH4|5.0|It's a catchy title, but let me be honest here; this article has nothing to do with Seattle, I just like catchy titles. But it does have everything to do with being speechless. I was all but left speechless after watching the recent Oscar-winning movie entitled The King's Speech. And then I saw it a second time, then a third. Okay, I'm a bit eccentric at times, and certainly was eccentric regarding this movie, as it touched a cord way down deeper than I thought existed. My wife claimed I was sobbing. I claim it was just a few tears flowing down my cheeks.  It's the story of the King of England and his journey in overcoming a painful-to-listen-to stammering problem. Don't take your kids as they use swearing for speech therapy. It reminded me of my Dad back on the farm, his tirades of calling cow manure by another word must have been therapy for me as a child ....I never dealt with stammering.  Life-message cords were strummed time and again and after the 3rd showing, for me, the melodious thread-of-a-message hidden within was beyond the obvious themes of Lionel's ability to befriend royalty while yet remaining loyal to his ornate commonness. It was more than his being a friend to one in high places despite unrequited love and lack of a royal understanding of reciprocation. It was more than a committed wife's love, courage, and patience to stand-by-her-man as she sought help far and wide to obtain the healing needed for him to rise up and succeed.  The whisper that roared, the line that really struck a cord, and what had me scrambling to take mental notes in a somewhat empty theater, was given by Lionel `the commoner' when faced with the inability to get the future King beyond the real root of his stammering issues ...that of the shame and pain from his past.  \\"You know, you don't have to be afraid of the things you were afraid of when you were five\\". It was as if the God was right beside me whispering, \\"do not forget this line\\".  Lionel `the commoner' said it with simplicity, with deep, heartfelt sincerity, and with a child-like honesty, \\"You know, you don't have to be afraid of the things you were afraid of when you were five\\".  Lionel Logue, a master at his trade of speech therapy, a gifted communicator, a spry, quick-witted humorist, and with the ability to reach into the heart of a matter if given the time, ....well Lionel had the discernment to know that within this royal kingsman, lies a man that never dealt with the hurts of his past. The abuse at an early age was presented with Ocsar-like descriptiveness, and as an audience, we felt his pain with empathetic realness.  And Lionel gently showed him the way; he brought him home to victory with pastoral-like greatness. He gained his trust, he became a friend, and he was able to get him to recognize the root of his shame and fears. And so began a journey where a commoner was able to bring royalty out of the dark shadows of the night, and present him in the light of day, to a nation that stood watching and waiting in fear, as Hitler's armies moved across Europe.  From stammerer to discovering that he has a voice, a voice that would calm the fears of a nation during Hitler's reign of terror. He would give voice to soundness, give voice to confidence ...he would be a voice to his nation, King George VI. And Lionel `the commoner' was by his side for every major speech thereafter for his entire lifetime. A true friend sticks closer than a brother the Good Book says.  I have been struck with the thought these past two weeks about how much the enemy of our souls tries to steal our voice. He desires to silence us, squelch us, anything within his power to keep us quiet.  How does he thwart us? One area I see so clearly is the correlation between shame and speechlessness. I began to see this when our Wednesday night prayer focus led by E. Daniel Martin was on the passage from Isaiah 54, and what resonated in me was verse 4,  \\"Have no fear; for you will not be shamed or be without hope: you will not be put to shame, for the shame of your earlier days will go out of your memory...\\"  What keeps us from giving voice ...to the reaching of the lost and dying corpses around us? What keeps us from giving voice ...to sharing comfort to those around us? And going a little deeper, as we so eloquently heard this morning at church, what keeps us frozen from risking outside our own personalities?  Certainly not the only thing, but shame is a big portion of what silences our voice. Without a voice, there is no prayer. Without prayer, well, you and I both know, there is no hope and no vision. Without vision, we all will perish according to Proverbs 29:18.  Shame of how we may have raised our children when they were younger may keep us speechless and left without a voice to intercede for them in their futures.  Shame of addictions keeps us silent to trust God to deliver us and others.  Shame of a difficult marriage relationship keeps us voiceless in our believing that it will ever change. Or the shame of watching our parents have a difficult marriage leaves us stammering in our faith to believe that we could ever hope to have a happy marriage.  How about the shame of financial lack? How can we pray for others, when we ourselves have finances in chaos?  Shame wants to silence us, yet God Almighty is declaring from the balconies of heaven, \\"You have a voice!\\" He sends us His Word, He sends us His very own Son, and he even sends us a true story put on the silver screen, to declare to you and to me, \\"We have a voice\\".  \\"He takes our shame\\", says Isaiah. I challenge you to give it to him. Give it to Him so you can have a voice once again. Do not let shame silence your future.  Writing is a voice,  ....an e-mail of love and encouragement is a voice,  ....your daily praying for someone or something is a voice.  ....even a smile on your face, in a crowded place, gives voice to changing someone's day.  Sing a song, write a poem. You have a voice.  Get past the shame, getpast the stammering ...be healed by forgiving those that pained you in the past; that school teacher, a bully, an abusive father, an accusing mother, maybe even a pastor or a very close friend.  ....whomever or however, just cry out to God and let it go.  Our pastor told us how just this morning, \\"Don't control your brokenness - let God bring you through, into something new\\". Somebody ought to write a song on that one.  You have a voice, you have something to give.  The world is waiting for what you have to say, for what you have to give. I have heard it said that the graveyard is the wealthiest place in the world, for therein lies books never written, sermons never preached, songs never composed..  It's true. Don't take your silence to the grave. Don't let die the wealth that resides within you. I want to hear ...others want to hear. The world longs and yearns to hear a voice. It might as well be yours.  You have a voice.  And together we have a voice. May we prophesy by declaring with our voice, that from our community,  ...songs will go forth,  ...writings will go forth,  ...the arts will go forth,  ...healings will go forth,  ...the preaching and teaching of the Word will go forth, from our town, all the way to ...Seattle. There now. I just gave voice to the title.  May your voice and my voice, your commonness and my commonness, touch heaven and earth this week.  - Don Hess 3-13-11

B000I2JDEY|5.0|After reading all of the reviews of this, the best film of the 1960's, there is little left to be said...except that in my estimation Richard Burton delivers the greatest performance by an actor in the history of cinema.  Yes Elizabeth won the prize for actress,  Sandy Dennis for supporting actress, but in the greatest blunder in AMPAS history, along with Rod Steiger's The Pawnnbroker, Richard Burton sadly did not win.  If you have not had the opportunity to see Mr. and Mrs. Burton at their best you owe it to yourself to take advantage of the small window into their own lives.  That's what makes this film so phenomenal.  Yes, the greatest performance of husband and wife in history. The extras on this 2 disc dvd are excellent.  Own it!
B0061TQBRK|5.0|Dark Adrenaline is the new album from Italian goth/metal band Lacuna Coil and as a fan I am delighted to say it ranks among their best so far. Vocals are shared, as usual, between Christina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro and they are strong as ever on the 11 new songs. The original tunes have their patented rich and moody lyrics with the guitars(Christiano Migliore and Marco Biazzi), bass(Marco Coti Zelati), drums(Christiano Mozzati) and keyboards(again Zelati) delivering strong support to the vocals and producing some haunting and melodic songs including the first single, \\"Trip The Darkness\\" and my favorite \\"Kill The Light\\". That plus a really awesome cover of R.E.M.'s \\"Losing My Religion\\" and you have 12 really strong tunes from a band that has delivered on every albums so far. There are no weak songs on this disc but, that's not surprising from the smoking hot Scabbia and co.
B004YD1KTO|4.0|Another great mystery/ crime novel. I bought this as soon as I had finished Sister and again, the emotional resonance of the characters as well as the mystery with its last minute twists was satisfying to read. A fire breaks out at a school and mother Grace and daughter Jenny are caught in the blaze. Critically injured, they are unconscious in hospital for the duration of the book, but the book is told from Grace's perspective as she and Jenny find themselves incorporeal watching the crime being investigated. It's a bit like The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold in this way. Lupton skillfully takes us down multiple wrong paths, weaving the emotion with the plot and the grand themes of the love of families. Recommended.

B003LR4QPE|5.0|I've found lots of great deals on Amazon over the years, but this is easily the most worthwhile purchase I have made in the last ten years. To record all of Bach is obviously an epic undertaking and Haenssler, Rilling et. al. have rendered us a great service by packaging such sublime music into an astoundingly cheap box set. Listeners know Rilling mostly for his superb renditions of the choral repertory, but will find that the instrumental recordings on offer here are are very good and in some cases equal to the choral works. I've just received my box today and am working my way through the keyboard works; as other reviewers have noted, I myself was a bit dubious about the seeming lack of star quality--I had never heard of Robert Hill, Peter Watchhorn and others and scoffed at the idea that they would hold a candle to the Bach specialists I have in my collection (Goode, Gould and Schiff, among others). While they might not match these others, they are more than competent--I also like that the set includes Bach performed on multiple keyboard instruments (clavichord, harpsichord, modern piano, etc.) as they've done with the Well-Tempered Klavier. Even connosieurs of Bach will find little played gems in this set--there are three CDs alone of early Bach keyboard works which I'd never heard but are fascinating to listen to. If you even like Bach you simply have to get this set. I'd give it six stars if I could.

They decide to murder their bosses and enlist the help of a funny Jamie Foxx.  Of course, things go wrong in a hilarious chain of events.<br />Bateman, Day and Seidarkis are perfectly cast, playing off each other beautifully.  Spacey is superb as the steely-eyed exec; Aniston oozes sexual malevolence and an unrecognizable Farrell is great as the smarmy cokehead.  Donald Sutherland, Julie Bowen, Ion Guffold and Bob Newhart are fine in small roles.<br />BOSSES is a lot of fun and very enjoyable.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is an amazing app.  it has helped me to get into the Word more often.  wherever I go I have the Bible in my pocket now!  I love the plans and having multiple versions at my fingertips.  I have recommended it to all my friends.

0143117564|2.0|I have read Pynchon since the early 1970s.  The complexity and irony overlaying thorough research on a tightly twisted story is what I came to expect.  It is not what I got.  It was more like Picasso being short of cash and throughing together some lines on a canvas for a pay day.  If this was a normal hack writer, I would have given it three or four stars.  There is a reference to a disappearing island in the Pacific, Lemuria, which in Tom's other books would have been fully developed and played some material role in the story.  In this book, it pops in and out, like a bobber on a fish line, but you can't reel it in.  Tom, I'm lightly entertained but disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is a great time killer. I use it on my kindle fire when I don't want to pay attention in class. lol

0439023513|1.0|I just finished this book, and I can only say that I was left feeling extremely frustrated.  I should point out that I LOVED the first two books, and was so looking forward to the last one!  Unfortunately, it was a blunt ending to a love story that the first two books had created so beautifully.  It seems as if the author just got tired of writing, and then just abruptly ended the series as if the audience hadn't just put all of our time and emotions into it.  Oh, so disappointed!!!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|[[ASIN:B006MQRLSA Moneyball]]  It's a great movie. The story is an excellent example of how the ideas of man can be achieved with the will power. The movie shows how the teamwork and different ways of dreaming can be effective.  This film has the capacity to engage viewers who are familiar or unfamiliar with the sport, based on the avant-garde approach to managing resources that is utilised by Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), which any person in business can appreciate.  I had great expectation before have seen the movie. After have seen the movie I think it was accomplished. The movie also is useful for all professors who teach management and want to show how confidence on people works..
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it's fun and it takes time and I like that I'm not perfect at it it is addicting to me and my freinds
B005L38QK2|5.0|I've been looking to replace my trusty old MS Intellimouse Optical 1.1 but was unable to find that perfect replacement. Found it with this.  Very similar size and weight, fits my hand perfectly. Everything worked first time, software was simple to use. Braided cable with the red details, ability to turn lights on/off/pulsate. Slight rubberized grip means no slipping during hardcore gaming. Buttons are all solid and feel great. Scroll wheel is precise and has scroll clicks.  Can't say enough good things about this mouse. Looks gorgeous, works perfectly and feels great.  The only con I can think of is that after the rest of the family tried it out, I now have to order 2 more for them...
B0011NVCSO|5.0|Bon Iver is by far one of my favorite artists. In my opinion, the music Justin Vernon(Bon Iver) writes is a direct reflection of the hard work, talent, and soul that goes into his work. For Emma, Forever Ago is his first album and every song on this album is incredible. The strange tunings that he plays in add a unique aspect to his music, because it's something different than average chord progressions. I could go on for days about how much I love this album, but I'll get to the important stuff. The record itself has great sound. I've ordered other records that have awful sound quality. The record came quickly and was in sturdy packaging which protected even the sleeve from any damage.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I am a huge Tintin fan since I was 12! I used to watch the Nelvana cartoon with my family back in the 90's and I never missed one single episode of it!! Besides, that's the TV series that introduced me to the character.<br /><br />Having grown up with the series, at that time I had no idea that it was inspired on a series of comics written by Belgian writer George Remi (Herg&eacute;), so when Internet finally came in the late 90's I started to search for those comics, and boy, I had a hell of a thrill ride!<br /><br />With that said, needless to say that I was eagerly waiting for this movie! Of course there is some other movie adaptations out there, but truth being told, they never made much justice to the supreme creation of Herg&eacute;.<br /><br />By the way, Herg&eacute; used to say that the only person alive capable of taking his creation to the big screen was Steven Spielberg. And boy, he was 100% right!!<br /><br />This first adaptation of the Tintin adventures around the world is brilliant!! More than brilliant!! It's perfect!! Seriously, the only thing more perfect than this would be if Spielberg copied the entire stories from the comics to the form of a movie. And don't get me wrong, he did keep the original story by Herg&eacute; almost intact in this movie, but being the great filmmakers that he and Peter Jackson are, they decided to have a take on more than one story per movie and put those stories to work together as a whole. Did it work? Oh yeah!<br /><br />In this first movie of a hopeful long series of movies (Herg&eacute; made 24 Tintin stories!!) they decide to introduce us to the characters. They introduce to the Tintin rookies the main character, the reporter Tintin and his dog Milou, who are two courageous fellas who are always ready for adventure. We also manage to meet the Dupont twins on this movie, two silly and dumb police officers and Captain Haddock, the longtime friend of the main character. Even the Moulinsart Castle and the lovely Bianca Castafiore was there.<br /><br />The stories chosen to this movie was \\"The Crab with the Golden Claws\\" (where Tintin and Haddock met for the first time), \\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\" and \\"The Red Rackham's Treasure\\", three of the most exciting stories of the Tintin collection.<br /><br />The animation is fantastic, fluent and the digital sets take your breath away. The acting is superb, they got the right cast to act, Andy Serkis as Haddock is spectacular!! And that's another strong point in the movie, the characterization of almost every character on Tintin's universe was kept intact, except for Dr. Sakharin, who in the original stories was never a descendant from Red Rackham, but it was a nice addition and brought more drama and interesting developments to the script.<br /><br />The humor is top notch!! I laughed out loud with the drunk jokes in the movie, in fact, I laughed out loud in the entire movie!! It was fantastic!! Being able to see all those beloved characters from my youth in the big screen exactly the way I used to know them was just great!!<br /><br />As for the story, well it's the story everyone as a fan already know. It was the same story we know from the comics and the Nelvana cartoon, but told differently, so, except for the Sakharin development, there was no surprises at all for me in terms of story.<br /><br />The only character I missed on the movie was Professor Tryphon Tournesol. I just love this scientist. He is deaf, but doesn't know it, so he gets everything wrong and usually causes a lot of trouble, but he have a heart of gold. I was eagerly hoping to see Prof. Tournesol on the movie with his shark submarine, but I guess I'll have to wait for the next one.<br /><br />And boy, I will be eagerly waiting for the next one, the one Peter Jackson will direct. I seriously hope to see more Tintin movies from now on. I'm also really sad that the film went so bad in the USA, I guess US people didn't get the point of Tintin, but I hope they willnext time.<br /><br />Anyway, great movie, wonderful adaptation, I hope to see more of this, and I will finish my review by saying: Great Snakes and Blistering Barnacles!! Go for Tintin!!! You won't regret it!!listering Barnacles!! Go for Tintin!!! You won't regret it!!
B000O98R7A|5.0|Although I wasn't alive at the time of it's original release, I opted for the original pressing rather than the newer remastered version. I decided it would be more realistic and true to it's original sound. I am very happy with this choice. I love the album. It sounds very good on my record player and it gives me the feeling that what I'm hearing is authentic. I love Pink Floyd and this album is definitely among their best work. The album came in a protective case, unlike other records that I had bought which arrived with damaged packaging. The poster and stickers that came with it were in almost mint condition. You really can't go wrong with this album.
0440178002|5.0|I will not describe the plot for it is lengthy, complicated and has many, many characters, and other fellow readers have covered it.  I will tell you however, that if you are even somewhat interested in Japanese culture, samurais and the clash of modern society with feudal society in Japan, then this novel will please you immensely.  It is richly endowed with fascinating and elaborated descriptions of what it meant to be a samurai, a daimyo, a courtesan, a peasant, a foreigner (barbarian!), a wife, a Catholic, a Protestant, a ship's pilot, a vassal and many other roles in Japan during the age of gunpowder and European colonization of the world's \\"less-advanced\\" civilizations.  Despite the many Japanese names thrown at the reader, you will be able to quickly remember and identify at the very least the main players, but every character is unique and complex.  Much like the film of \\"Red Cliff\\", both main heroes and villains are multi-faceted and clever...there's plenty of plans and counter-plans and counter-counter-plans, and sudden tactics that are not clear at the moment they are read but are eventually fully explained.  Of course, the culture-shock of the British main character is well-handled and his progression towards a person worth belonging in their society will undoubtedly remind readers of the film \\"The Last Samurai.\\"  As a matter of fact, this book completely eclipses the plot of the mentioned Tom Cruise's movie.  I actually came across this book while I was shopping for Christmas gifts for my family, and was so interested in what people had to say about it that I immediately purchased it for my personal enjoyment.  I am very pleased to have known and read this novel, and now I am looking forward to watching the 1980 TV series adaptation.  Obviously, it would not be the same but even I have an itch to see it brought to the screen once again in these modern times.  The epic story more than merits it.  Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think this game is fun because it has so many little games. some are frustrating and it makes you wanna spend hours just to beat them :)

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I find this app to be lots of fun. The only problem I have with it is the lack of directions for how to play the games. other than that... great
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I loved the movie (5 stars) but will leave its review to the others.  This review is to verify the features of the 2-Disc digital copy edition.  I bought this for $3.49 - a screaming deal - and way less than even the value single disc edition.  I couldn't understand why it was so much less.  After reading the features, I noticed that the digital copy \\"expired\\" on 11/17/2010 -- that must be it. \\"Oh well,\\" I thought, \\"don't really need that anyway. And did I mention it was only $3.49?\\"  So the disc arrives and the fine print says the digital copy \\"may\\" not be valid after 11-17-10.  I figure it doesn't hurt to try ... loaded the disc into my PC, fired up iTunes, entered the \\"expired\\" code, and voila! It's in my library!  I got the regular DVD AND a digital copy for $3.49!
B0042J6VUS|4.0|Got two of these and they both work perfectly for how I use them. Makes outdoors video much easier as well as indoors. It \\"Looks\\" like it won't fit an iPhone but the armature at the top expands to accommodate my iPhone 3GS just fine and the tripod holds onto it nice and snug, as well as providing a safe upright mount.
B00005JNS0|4.0|My 7 year old granddaughter enjoys watching Cars 1 with her Mom; I'm glad I could find this 2006 DVD to go with her Cars 2 DVD she got for Christmas.  Love Pixar movies! Great buying experience from Amazon approved Seller.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a great game to pass the time. most of the games are clean addictive fun, granted some are corny but still fun. the kids can play these games without a worry.
B0014KBAHM|5.0|I love Britney Spears' 3rd album Britney. Her songs are so amazing.

B005UKMWMY|5.0|After watching every single episode of House for years, last season seemed so bad, the story lines, the Cuddy drama... needless to say, I was wary about this season.  But from the first episode I was surprised, it was completely liberated by Cuddy departure and the story lines are great, the acting is great and I don't miss 13 for an instant.  If you were put off by the heavy handed writing last season, take heart, this season is funnier, sharper and more on point than ever before. We just get Hugh Laurie at his best and what else could you really ask for?
B0052UZIFA|3.0|works great in the droid charge. does not work on the galaxy nexus. works for a little bit and then just freezes which makes it useless to play
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Amazing concert Adele is one of the best British solo singers that sounds exactly like her records sorry cd's the atmosphere in the Royal Albert hall is fantastic this CD plus DVD is by far one of the best i have seen for a long long time Adele has an a amazing voice her backing group is also very good & the band members are very good as well i recomend people buy this to show how good she is in concert
0525478817|5.0|John Green is no doubt an amazing author. I went into the book with great and high expectations, I was not let down. Green snags you up, and pulls at your heart strings and makes you fall in love. It is worth the buy, I promise.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|decent li5le set of games.  not much replayability, but you are always looking to get more point's. so you can.see what's next, if you know what I mean.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a winner! Action, unexpected events, humor, and most importantly an amazing message built into a vulgar free full length well done movie. My heart was racing throughout...for various reasons. It left me feeling motivated to ensure I wasn't a \\"good enough\\" parent...but instead reach for the courage to take seriously the gift God has blessed me with by properly parenting my 2 beutiful children.  This movie was terrific...clearly sending a much needed message in a VERY loving way. Yes, it has many plots going on...but it made sure most people's scenarious were included..and even for those fathers not making the grade...it  has a powerful message that it is never to late and that you are an equal to all of us!  For God will be our lone judge...not each other.  WELL DONE MOVIE!  Hobbys and our jobs have no eternal impact...but the souls of our children do..and that is a motivating thought!
B0045HCJKS|4.0|It starts slow, but builds up to a good finale. After arriving at the entertainment complex of Westworld, our main characters explore the offerings and meet the real star of the show, Yul Brynner, dressed as the gunslinger. While they mix it up with staged bar fights and shoot-outs, things slowly go wrong at the complex and the robots begin to take on a life or their own and turn against the guests. The final segment is Brynner stalking Richard Benjamin, leading up to the much-copied ending. Not a great movie, but my kid enjoyed the second half. Spend the money and kick back.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I got my package fast.In fact, it came two days earlier than the expected arrival time.  Both the dvd and casing have no scratches or tears. Perfect picture,quality and sound.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Works very well on Kindle Fire.  The ads aren't overly obtrusive, but if they do become bothersome it's not too much of a stretch to pay 99 cents for it.
B00005S6K8|5.0|As a \\"heart-on-my-sleeve\\" romantic, I am always on the lookout for good romantic comedies.  Not sure how I missed \\"Sabrina\\" when it was released in 1995, but I recently purchased it on the advice of a dear friend.  \\"Sabrina\\" now holds a place of honor alongside \\"Somewhere in Time\\" at the top of my favorite movie list!  This movie has it all...beautiful scenery of Paris, wonderful acting, a heartfelt love story, and a dreamy musical score...most notably \\"In the Moonlight\\", sung by Sting.<br /><br />So many warm moments in this film.  I find myself watching it as a spirit-lifter when I'm tired or sad.  Works like a charm!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I had both Google and kindle bible and they are not as good as this. MUST HAVE APP FOR ANY CHRISTIAN!!
B004I8WD6E|3.0|I love the look and fit of this case and it works great for when you drop your phone because of the texture of the case and the fact that it covers a bit of the front of the phone.  My only problem with it is that it gets in the way of the flash on the camera.  It makes the photos very light...I am disappointed because other than that it's the best case I have found, especially for the price.  It looked like the hole was big enough but obviously it's not.  :(
B001E57SH8|5.0|My first impression of this lighter in person, was that it is of normal Zippo quality. After filling it with my year-plus old Colibri Premium Butane, this baby ignited just as she should have. After nearly two weeks of use,and not yet having to refill, I am happy to say that BLU flame still fires up on the FIRST TRY ! One thing to note: co-workers borrowing this lighter tend to forget where they got it from !
B0006B2A42|4.0|\\"Ice Station Zebra\\" is a good, solid drama but gets more than three stars only because of the acting. The film is different than the novel, which was written by Alistair MacLean, and MacLean was a better writer than 99 percent of Hollywood hacks. MacLean's novel makes sense but many parts of this movie don't. In the novel there is no traitor on the ship. In the movie there is, but what I assume was added to create suspense just created incoherency. The ending is different in the film, reflecting, one assumes, the leftwing politics of Hollywood. (The U.S. shouldn't be allowed to win a Cold War battle. Has to be a draw.)<br />  However, the acting is superb, led by the magnificent Patrick McGoohan, who has any number of noteworthy lines. Even the silly ones sound sensible when McGoohan says them. Excellent theme too.<br />  Recommended but if they had stuck with MacLean's novel it would have been a better film.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this app is fun on any device you have, theirs tons of packs and some are very difficult for me I beat the game in a week but tugs because its a fun game money well spent well worth $.99!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It's fine if you have an older device with enough horsepower to run it, but anything running Android 4.0 or later will not run it because the application isn't updated.  Don't buy it.  If you can get it for free it may be worth your time on an old device, but otherwise you're just wasting time and money.  There's no reason to think the Developer will ever fix it.
B00715SUI6|5.0|this in my opioning was the best one yet...very good story line i was kinda confussed on some parts but the scary parts made up for that!!!check it out if your a fan like me...

B004XN3FHA|5.0|The manual has a chart about the batteries you can use. I originally thought I would just use standard disposable AA batteries until I noticed, when turbo mode was on, it was only putting out a little more light than the setting right before turbo. Ni-mh 2500 mah were used for testing and also recommended, so I tried some of them in the tk 41. The flashlight now seems to be twice as bright as the brightness I was already amazed about. And the beam doesn't change as the batteries drain, which is unlike the cheap disposable batteries. I am certain the reviews would be even better if everyone used the recommended batteries!<br /><br />I recently wanted a more intense flashlight, and after a great deal of research I bought the Fenix TK41. I wasn't sure if the TK41 would put out the light I was interested in, but after trying it in the dark I was blown away in amazement. I could not stop going outside to see the beam it puts out!  I bought my step dad a 2M Stanley spotlight for the holidays and the TK41 puts out a beam just as far and it is a far better quality beam.  There is a spot light area in the beam of the TK41 and also a flood area, so that way it completely lights up the area...beautiful! Not to mention it is water proof, drop resistant, has six modes, and the case is very well designed in every way. All of those \\"little\\" great qualities add up to a product that is truly amazing. I love this light and wish I could afford to buy one for everyone in my family.
0385534639|2.0|I just didn't. Beautiful images, absolutely fantastic plays on words but unfortunately the story just wasn't very strong. All the jumping around from year to year, place to place got old very quickly. Phrases like \\"the man in the grey suit\\" versus just stating his name became annoying as I would try and figure out who was being talked about. I really wanted to love this book. The reviews had been fantastic and I just knew it would be better than expected, but unfortunately it just doesn't cut it. The flow of the book, the way it was written, all made it hard for me to stay interested. As beautiful as the images were that the author was creating - after a while it grew wearisome. The sparklingly stars, the soft grey fabric with billowing ribbons - just overkill.
B0026P3G12|5.0|My grandson is now 4 years old and Susan Boyle's rendition of Wild Horses is still his all  favorite Night-Night song.<br />No other singer's version is \\"right\\".<br />He knows it by heart and sings along.Thank you Susan

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Solid remote connection app. Played SWTOR (non-action maintenance) remotely using this app over 3G. Quite impressed. Gives you full access to your PC and thanks to recognizing PCs with google accounts you can connect non-wifi over the mobile network. I also like both of the mouse control modes. If you have issues with typing try switching to another android keyboard. SwiftkeyX gave me some problems but didn't have any issues with Better Keyboard.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Very addictive!  Buyer beware. Angy birds has fantastic graphics and very easy controls. Each leval possess its own unique challange to over come and master.
B002PEP4SC|2.0|I am a great fan of the Castle series on TV which features an author, named Richard Castle, who is teamed up with a female cop, named Beckett. In the series Castle publishes three books with Nikki Heat (based on Beckett) as the main character. So when I saw that there actually were three Nikki Heat books on Amazon I had to try them. What a disappointment. The plot was reasonable, likewise the action, but the characters - oh dear, they were dire. They never came to life and seemed like puppets carrying out the motions. As Richard Castle is a fictional character I checked out the copyright which was ABC Studios and I reckon the books must have been written by a ghost writer or a script writer, but certainly not by any novelist worth his or her salt. I certainly won't be buying the other two books, although I will continue to watch the tV series.
B0000009XP|5.0|Buddy Guy is so talented he kicks a** on the guitar this album will leave you in shock when you get done listening to it.

Thank you Buddy Guy for putting out great music that doesnt suck!!!! and being bad a** on the guitar.
1601252463|5.0|Pathfinder is the RPG of the future (and the present), and this book provides more depth and options to the core rules.  I expect most games will want to include most, if not all, of the new rules.  I, personally, have not included The Alchemist in my campaign because I think the artificial limitations on it are not organic to the character concept, although obviously necessary for game balance.  We have had a lot of fun with witches and oracles are surprisingly powerful.  My group does not find much use for Cavaliers, but looks forward to trying out the Inquisitor.  Warning: Summoners can easily become a broken class if the GM is not attentive (as I wasn't).  A properly built eidolon can synergize with a character to a remarkable (and dangerous) degree.  Overall, it maintains Paizo's quality of presentation and balance, and is a useful addition to the RPG ruleset.  Sometime in the future, it would be nice to have updated spell lists from all of the expansions put in one place, all the archetypes grouped, etc.
0307341569|5.0|I was given Gillian Flynn's first novel SHARP OBJECTS several years ago. It took me several months before I even considered picking it up off my shelf and reading it. The friend who gave it to me is a bit \\"literary\\", so I was concerned it would be too much for me. I like \\"entertainment\\" reading. No deep, deep meanings to sort through. Thank goodness I read it. And then when SHARP OBJECTS came out and she passed it on to me I again devoured Gillian Flynn's dark and haunting style.<br /><br />Read it. And read SHARP OBJECTS. Flynn is a great writer with a talent for leaving you wanting more.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I truly enjoy this game.  this version easier to manipulate but very challenging.  Lot's of fun. Have some fun of your own.
B005P3NPXG|4.0|While I didn't hate Seal's previous \\"Soul\\" collection, I was underwhelmed. Surprisingly, Seal sounded lackluster, almost uncomfortable with the songs he chose. It almost felt like he was going through the motions. I felt, for a while there in his career, his seemingly happy personal life put music lower on the priority list.  Overall, nothing he had made was terrible over the past 5 or 6 years, but it didn't have the rich melancholy or angst that his first three albums had. There was a sublime richness permeating throughout and, at the risk of sounding cliche, there was even a genius to many of his songs.  So, I was disappointed that it almost felt like he was, again, going through the motions on the first \\"Soul\\" compilation.  But there are no such problems here. The list of songs fits him better and he seems to be more inspired and passionate here. And, as at least one other person mentioned, his still fresh divorce seems to hover over this release even though these songs were recorded and pressed long before.  There are no James Brown classics here. While Seal's attempt to tackle a Brown song is understandable and even commendable, Seal's smooth vocals are no match for Brown's, and so, his cover of \\"It's a  Man's Man's Man's World\\" lacked the required oomph. The same could be said of his take on \\"Here I Am (Come and Take Me)\\" lacking Al Green's fire or the cover of \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" missing the melancholy and resonant depth that Sam Cooke delivered on arguably what is his defining song.  So, with \\"Soul 2\\" I'm glad that Seal decided to mostly tone it down, choosing songs and production values that let the song fit his vocal style. That's evident on \\"What's Going On,\\" where he slows it down and mellows it out so he's not trying to recreate that the legendary Marvin Gaye but present. That's where he erred on the first \\"Soul,\\" trying to match the strengths of James Brown, Al Green or Sam Cooke. In short, \\"Soul\\" was Seal playing it safe.  Thankfully, he avoids that here, resulting in an album that is pleasantly full of Seal-style versions of classic R&B songs, rather than Seal just trying to match them note for note, tempo for tempo.  If Seal stays on this path of choosing the right songs, right production values and fitting refinement, I would warmly welcome \\"Soul 3.\\"
0439023513|2.0|Mixed feelings here.  Okay. That's how I felt about it at the end. Just okay. There wasn't anything the felt wrong about how the author portrayed Katniss comparing her to the two earlier books. It makes sense how things happen. But for a lack of better words, this felt too 'correct'. Yes, yes. War, revolution, the point is made. It's a depressing thing and there is no fairytale ending after everything that has happened.  As the book dragged on it felt like it had lost its charm that the first two books had. There needed to be a balance of what we came to love about the first book and what was to be expected in a war field. Mockingjay scenes are bombarded with bad thing after bad thing. This sort of thing can work, but the pace of it all felt jumbled and ushered. Many of the things I had wanted to see more of was the important bond between Katniss and Gale, why I should care more about the squad Katniss was assigned to, possibly more of a growth of villainous from President Coin, and others that would take too long to list out. If the book was split into two parts with each easing into the major actions/deaths that happened then this book might've left me with a better feeling.  If you loved the first two books I feel it's important to see how things end. Especially with how the second book ends. But the best thing you can do to enjoy it is to wipe your slate clean and try to enjoy it for what it is due to how different it is from the first two.

B0058YPGSY|5.0|The Sons of Anarchy is a very good TV series that my wife and I enjoy. It is full of action and the script and acting are very good. Season 4 starts with the Sons getting out of jail after 14 months and heading home. A new sheriff in town stops them and tells them they can't wear their colors or they will be in violation of their parole. Things have changed a lot in the last 14 months, new sheriff, a new suburban development is going full bore into construction and a new US Attorney is in Charming under cover to get rid of SAMCRO by building a RICO case.<br /><br />The Sons set a trap and kill the Russian mob members at a wedding and then set up a meeting with a drug cartel to sell them heavy weapons. In a joint deal Clay agrees to smuggle drugs for the cartel and club is divided over being drug mules which is something they never wanted to get involved in. The money is good but the risks are high and the penalties and dangers are something some gang members do not want to deal with.<br /><br />Season 4 in my opinion is one of the best of the series and Clay's out of control actions put everyone at risk. Clay will do everything to remain at the top of SAMCRO including murder and lying, things that he is used to doing. This season has a lot of action and is gory as murders and violence increase as the plot unwinds. Clay's actions are over the top and Jax decides that he must do something to rein him under control.<br /><br />If you like Sons of Anarchy you will love this DVD set of Season 4. You will not be able to stop watching the episodes until you are done. This series just seems to get better as time goes along and I can't wait for Season 5.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is really good. Yes, some of the levels are a bit challenging but you'll get them at some point.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|As a kid, I loved the English versions of French comic artist and author Herg&eacute;'s action adventure stories of the intrepid teen reporter Tintin and his smart and brave dog Snowy.  Producer Peter Jackson and director Stephen Spielberg, both long-time fans have teamed up to deliver a surprisingly hard action adventure that entertains and exhausts and is true to the source material in numerous details of both tale and design.
B006C1DH92|1.0|halfbrick jus let me down, again! I can't imagine how an ios game moves to SamSung Galaxy devices can be so laaaag like that! We will see how long they coss to fix it this time.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|You don't have to be a Tom Cruise fan, and it must be admitted here that his star power has been badly tarnished, but he serves well as the token action figure in director Brad Bird's sensational action thriller that's really an excuse to create stunning, visceral set pieces that speed the heart and catch one's breath.  It's a not so absurd premise that quickly tricks you into a willing acceptance by thrusting you into danger that seems so real and imminent it's impossible to escape without leaving the theater.  And that option is unlikely when you are frozen in your seat.  At this writing, still playing at Select Imax theaters with the bonus seven minute prologue teaser of Chris Nolan's fabulous and intense \\"THE DARK KNIGHT RISES.\\"
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It did better than origin one.  Bigger story and nice graphics. Rovio should put the boss mode in original version. But, come on! Where is another half final season? it's too late!!!
B001NPDCFQ|4.0|Vincent Minelli's beloved heartland American film gets the Blu-ray treatment in a stunning transfer of this true musical classic.  For those few who don't know, Judy Garland is Esther Smith, who pines for the boy next door (Tom Drake) in this wonderful tale about the trials and tribulations of a close-knit St. Louis family on the eve of the 1904 World's Fair.  This is the one with \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" and \\"The Trolley Song.\\"  If you like American musicals, this is one of the very best.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I bought 5 Controllers n all was fine! when i use it i feel i was playing x2 Speed AWESOME!!!!
B0059XTUMC|5.0|Michel Hazanavicius truly enchanting \\"silent\\" romance beautifully conjures a 1927 Hollywood in all its glory.  Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo and John Goodman star in a film that could easily be mistaken for a genuine masterpiece of the era when sound and color would change the movies forever.<br /><br />I predict this a shoo-in for Best Film.  It is not to be missed. As a pure technical achievement, it is close to perfection in the beauty of its silvery, shimmering light and velvety shadows.  In screen format and cinematography, with real Los Angeles locations and excellent vintage sets, props, costumes all convey a lost place and time.<br /><br />But at its heart, what most envelops the viewer is a feeling of love, longing and desire.  This is what the magic of movies is all about.  It's not a spoof or parody and thankfully it is devoid of irony.  Here is that rarest of the rare - pure cinema.<br /><br />Don't miss this gift from movie heaven.<br /><br />To me, it's really a French made film shot in LA, but it does not count as a foreign film.

B0063IH60K|5.0|couldn't ask for a better free app! only upgrade id make is for top scores to be more visible - would add another level to the fun.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I really was excited to acquire this app,  as I love classic Uno &amp; thought this would be an excellent game to have on my Kindle Fire. It very well may be a great game, I wouldn't know as it will not load. I have tried uninstalling, then reinstalling yet to no avail.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Update added excessive ads all over the place, not even worth my time anymore, uninstalling this mildly entertaining PoApp immediately.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|I received the product in a timely fashion. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. I was surprised to see how cheap the actual product looked, though. The cases for the discs were very cheaply made, and two of them didn't even snap shut. It's a must have for a Matrix fan, but if you are overly concerned about the quality of the case, then I might consider passing on it.
B0018TLRTK|5.0|I owned one Billy Idol CD - Vital Idol - which I enjoy immensely. Adding this CD to my collection is definately a plus. I ripped it to my media player and have played it over and over. Billy Idol Rocks!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Lots mini-games that will pass the time. Most are horribly coded. I would never pay money for these mini-games, it's really strange seeing an option to pay $20 for credits to games that last only minutes. Still, this is worth getting, especially if you have friends wanting to see your device's games.

B005AUWY90|5.0|This is a Great movie for kids of all ages . We had seen it at the movies and it was as good as the 1st one . your going to love it.
1936891026|5.0|Besides the main theme of the book which is get off of your a$$ and do it already I really enjoyed the little tidbits about professionalism, criticism, and keeping a cool head. Very sound advice for those going at it \\"alone\\" (freelance, etc).
B0018AK9RA|5.0|I loved this album from start to finish. I my have loved this album I know a lot of people out there are going to hate it. Yes this doesn't sound anything like the old Priest does. One main reason why I think not a lot of people are going to dig this album is because Rob is really big into Black Metal and he wanted use some of that elements that black metal uses but in the Priest style. If you like Black Metal and Priest than you are going to love this album. For the haters out there on this album. Hate all you want because this album is great!
B00005RRHC|5.0|This cd is very good.  The condition is excellant and is just as described.  I would not hesitate to order again from this site.  It was timely and perfect.
B006DICWUE|5.0|Rejoice, Nada Surf fans, for they are back and better than ever.  All the things we love, here--perfect melodies, crunchy, noisy guitars, catchy tunes.  It's hard to imagine how these guys could ever do a bad album, and as I listen to this album again and again, I am thinking that it is going to be one of my favorites.  Standout tracks include \\"When I was Young\\", \\"Teenage Dreams\\", and \\"Jules and Jim\\", although throughout the entire album, I am struck by what a solid set of tunes this is.  Aching, sweet, sharp--all together in their patented blend.  I love Nada Surf, always have, and this album is everything I love about them.  Is it possible for a band to be in its prime and just stay there?  That's what NS have done for me, and I'm thankful for it.  Check it out, it's a great listen.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|I'm a fan of broken, unmusical voices.  Leonard Cohen, Vic Chesnutt, Tom Waits...and Bob Dylan.  But as is so often the case, the compositions of these amazing singer/songwriters can sound fresh and vibrant in the vocals of someone more, shall we say, technically accomplished.  Such is the case with many of the songs on \\"Chimes.\\"  Although, having said that, an early favorite is Kris Kristofferson's take on \\"The Mighty Quinn,\\" which makes superb use of gargles-with-glass throatiness.  The songs on this album span nearly the entire length of Dylan's career so far, even reviving a couple of favorites from his gospel-influenced days.  I'm not a fan of what Sinead O'Connor did with the song \\"Property of Jesus,\\" but I did appreciate someone resurrecting the song.  Same with \\"Gotta Serve Somebody.\\"  Perhaps the best songs are the ones that play directly into Amnesty International's messages of peace and justice.  Dylan seems like the perfect poster child for AI, and the international flavor of many of the tracks underscores that message.  The other way that the medium emphasizes the message is in the album's dizzying tolerance--not to say embrace--of all styles, from front-porch folk (Pete Seeger on \\"Forever Young\\") to harmonious punk (Bad Religion on \\"It's All Over Now, Baby\\"), to every point in between.  Forget ebony and ivory--if Miley Cyrus can live side-by-side with K'NAAN in my MP3 player, perhaps there's hope we can all learn to get along.
B006CBSE86|5.0|Wow, I've just realized that Nightwish released a new album. After listening to it, I completely understand that even the oldest fans of the band have split opinions. It's different from any previous album, but IMHO it is still Nightwish, the music and the entire concept is brilliant, and I really like it. If I may say, it reminds me of some Dream Theater albums that also had the songs of the album arranged into a \\"story\\". I'm soooo waiting to see the movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I haven't unlocked all the games yet but so far they are pretty good. The difficulty ranges and even if I've passed a game I go back to get a better score. Not to mention it is free.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Great case!  Very well finished, fit & finish are perfect, excellent design (very minimal/simple, yet protects well).  I am very picky about cases for all devices (to the point most do not appease me and I go without), but I cannot find a single fault with this case - highly recommended!<br /><br />Initially I was worried about the 'hinge' (material that holds the top to the shell) would quickly wear out, but after a few weeks of use & abuse, it is showing no signs of wear.  Only time will tell how long it lasts, but I suspect it will far outlast my expectations and further outperform it's own $30 price point.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is great! ive had a lot of fun with it since I got it. I recommend it!!! You will have a blast with it!
B001ASVXSE|5.0|Of course, this is a great collection. It is a pointless exercice to try and decide who was \\"the greatest\\" violinist of the 20th century - Heifetz, Milstein, Stern, Oistrakh, Perlman, and sorry for all those I forget ? - but Oistrakh was unquestionably among those greatest. Of course a lot of Oistrakh's recorded repertoire is missing from this EMI collection - no Bach, no Bartok, no Vivaldi, just two out of 10 Violin and Piano Sonatas of Beethoven and just one from Brahms and Mozart, Prokofiev's first Sonata but not his second, no Chausson Poem or Ravel Tzigane, no Debussy and Ravel Sonatas, none of Grieg, Janacek or Shostakovich, no trios of Dvorak, Mendelssohn, Rachmaninov, Ravel, Rimsky, Shostakovich, Smetana, Taneyev or Tchaikovsky, no Schubert opus 100, no Shostakovich 2nd Concerto, no Concertos of Glazunov, Kabalevsky, Hindemith, Myaskovsky, Stravinsky, Szymanowski and, most glaring of all, not those of Dvorak, Mendelssohn and Tchaikovsky. Sometimes Oistrakh is represented here by his mono recordings rather than by his stereo remakes - specifically, in the Violin Concertos of Khachaturian and Sibelius. As one commentator under another review remarked, only the EMI productions are reissued here. Melodiya productions that were at some point, in the LP era, licenced by EMI/Angel, are absent, which includes Tchaikovsky's Concerto with Rozhdestvensky and Shostakovich's 2nd with Kondrashin, the stereo remakes of Khachaturian's and Sibelius' Concertos, various recordings of Sonatas of Brahms, Franck, Schubert, Prokofiev, Shostakovich with Frida Bauer and Richter - but NOT Schubert's 2nd Trio, which was never licensed by EMI/Angel.  Not that I am making it a complaint. As it is, those 17 CDs offer an abundance of riches and is a must-have for any fan of violin, and simply of classical music, who hasn't been around long enough to have all this stuff already in the previous CD reissues. Not my case: I have it almost all already, which means that I won't be purchasing this set. But I will try and make this a helpful review nonetheless, by giving the complete info about track listing, remasterings, and links to the previous reissues, where in some cases you will find my detailed review (since I am limted to ten links, I'll send the rest to the comments section). I haven't given Oistrakh's name as soloist: he always is, even when he has partners. He appears also as conductor in the Mozart Concertos and concertante works. Not all the content of this new box are new digital remasterings. In some cases EMI has retained the earliest remasterings, done on the occasion of the first CD reissue in the mid-1980s. Only those indicated 2008 are really new.

Beethoven's Archduke Trio (CD 1) and Schubert's First (CD 16) were reissued on an EMI \\"forte\\" twofer with the encores of Ysaye, Wieniawski, Suk and Kodaly now on CD 15 - sensibly, not those licensed by Testament (but note that the two Brahms Sonatas are played not by David but by his son Igor): [[ASIN:B000002SEE Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms: Chamber Works with Violin]].

030788743X|5.0|I rarely give 5-star ratings.  Without checking, I'll guess that maybe 3 or 4 percent of my nearly 600 customer reviews were five stars.  This novel fully deserves the top rating because I haven't had this much fun reading a book in ages!  This story of a virtual world in the mid 21st century, OASIS, and a resilient hero, Wade/Parzival, had me often feeling tempted to skip ahead to see what would happen in the story.  It's a tale of a talented but impoverished young man who exists in OASIS much more than in the dreary and decaying world of his \\"real\\" existence, but more than that, it's a thrilling action-adventure story with very likable characters.<br /><br />Reviews of Ready Player One tend to emphasize its many pop culture references.  That had me a little worried, as I thought I might be left behind by references I didn't know, or that I wouldn't \\"get it.\\"  I was afraid I'd have to be reading the book while frequently and simultaneously using google and wiki.  I needn't have fretted, both because my own mental databank of '80s trivia turned out to be bigger than I expected, but mainly because one doesn't need to know the references to enjoy the story in Ready Player One.  Things are explained sufficiently as you go along, so no external searching is necessary.<br /><br />I did see various parallels to Scott Pilgrim in Ready Player One, especially in the video game references and the questing angle.  The difference is that this book has much more of a complex and layered story than Pilgrim did.  (Ex., Parzival faces much greater danger than just getting beaten in hand-to-hand combat!)  Plus, this book was a LOT more entertaining than Scott Pilgrim was.
1451648537|5.0|hi,  I got this book about jobs to see how he worked. the book is well written and isaacson is a good writer. he was a person that wanted to control things. he was only in the spot light when he wanted. So you can say he gave walter his live story. steve had control on almost everything in life. (  I believe myself that  he know he would never read the finished book himself. ) An I'm glad that I bought the book. it is a must have .  steve ( apple ) jobs still has control .    bye steve
B000UZ4EP2|5.0|An artfully crafted blend of traditional celtic/folk sound and contemprary songs. Not quite what you'd hear at a folk club, to be sure, but you can definately hear the traditional celtic influences. Several of the songs have a bit of Gaelic woven into them somewhere, one even has some chorus & background sung in Native American tongues. Beautiful vocals too. I absolutely love it :)
B004UID2LC|2.0|this app os good but when i download stuff the pictures for the songs become something they shouldn't andvits very annoying
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I love this app it is a great Bible with tons of translations. You have to have an account to take notes, devotions, or anything besides read it. I tried twice to sign up and get an account, but neither time it worked. It said I wasn't verified. So really you might as well get a normal paper Bible... at least you can highlight that.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|For starts, I am in favor of this app being assigned as free. The application is truly a seasonal treat with outstanding varitey. I found thy with interesting graphics and was high in deatails. A hillarios way to bring back a caos related classic touched off with holiday flair. The set up and difficulties are remarkably stunning. All the holidays coming together with an angry bird riot behind it all. Indeed, the producers of thy have made a successful hit once again.  I am sure they will bring you even more comedy in the future. Angry Birds Seasons gets a five star worthy marking. This app truly goes above and beyond the average requirements to an app. This work of art is something to be proud of. I highly reccemend it for all the old and new Angry Birds fans and critics. Great work hear, folks.
B001I0T92Q|1.0|Got this, 1st slot is the only one that works, will not recognize a card larger than 16GB. Avoid it.  Edit: Managed to get a new 32GB card to work, slot two has to have a card in it or it won't recognize anything. However slot 2 won't read any capacity, put a 2GB MicroSD in slot 2, a 32GB MicroSDHC card in slot one then works. Still disappointed I can't put my 2nd 32GB card in slot 2.
B005ZKYXZI|3.0|The filmmakers hit their target audience with this fight themed drama about a washed up boxer (Hugh Jackman) who is now heavily invested in robot fighting which is now all the rage in a near future America.  Unfortunately, Charlie (Jackman) must have taken too many hits to the head as he makes ridiculous bets with guys who insist on getting their money now when they win.  What a concept.  Charlie finds out that a former flame has died - his reaction, OK - and that he now has custody of a son aged somewhere between 8 and 11.  He's really not sure.  Max (Dakota Goyo) has an aunt who wants to adopt him.  Charlie agrees but not until he bribes the aunt's rich husband for $50K.  That's enough to get another fighting robot.<br /><br />Charlie agrees to take Max for the summer, and then turn him over to his aunt.  Max knows nothing about this of course.  Max becomes an asset because he knows his roboboxing.  They find a discarded sparring robot at a junk yard and clean him up.  What do ya' know.  He starts to win.  I'm about as bored writing this plot as the film often becomes.  Every match outcome is easily predicted.  We know that the reluctant father and the lonely boy will bond.  We know Charlie will reconcile with his current girlfriend (an underutilized Evangeline Lilly).  If you've ever seen \\"Rocky\\" or the new \\"Warrior\\" or the old animated \\"Iron Giant\\", then you've probably seen this one too.<br /><br />It really isn't all that bad however.  In fact, it delivers familiar moral prescriptions to a whole new audience not familiar with the previous films. The transfer looks very good, complete with a nice mixture of live filming mixed in with CGI tricks.  The sound is magnificient in the HD surround.

B004EPZ02A|3.0|I'm not sure if it's just because this series is getting tired or if maybe I was, but this edition didn't quite have the fear factor of the others.  At the same time, the idea while no longer unique has a certain dread about it that most of us can appreciate.  This is a prequel to the first two and goes back to 1988 when sisters Katie (PA 1) and Kristi (PA 2) were young girls and get their first haunted house experience...thanks a lot grandma!<br /><br />We get to see the events as their father-like boyfriend of mom and  photographer (Christopher Nicholas Smith) uses a couple cameras to video tape (yes VHS) events inside their house.  Dennis (Smith) is a professional in that his primary source of income is shooting wedding videos.  I don't think mom works so I'm not sure how they can afford such a nice house, but we also don't know where the real father is either.  I digress.<br /><br />PA 3 does have an innovative idea that really works.  Dennis mounts the camera on a rotating fan so that he can pan across the kitchen into the dining room and foyer.  This trick amps up the suspense and anticipation as we get to see what may or may not be coming.  And while there are the usual \\"jump out/gotcha\\" scenes as well as the \\"fake\\" ones that usually involve a cat, there is one in particular shot in the kitchen that will get your heart racing.  Still, this movie doesn't quite measure up to the others.  Maybe it's just the old video tape vs. digital.  This Blu ray version also comes with a DVD and a digital copy.  The \\"Unrated Dirctor's Cut\\" adds about 10 minutes in additional spookiness and comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio sound layer.

B000PAU032|5.0|Hans Zimmer is great! Bought this CD for the suite music. Everything on this CD is great. Even some extra special tunes. :)
030788743X|3.0|This book certainly has fun subject matter -- '80s nostalgia, video games, computers, geek culture galore -- but I found myself not caring about the characters and the book's outcome is wholly predictable. The biggest problem is the declarative writing style as opposed to an immersive, descriptive one. I look forward to seeing whether Mr. Cline can mature as a writer and truly embrace the mantra \\"show don't tell\\"*. At that point, his books will level-up.  * Rush  Presto  Atlantic, 1989
0439023513|2.0|I must say, I am utterly shocked, though less in surprise than in disappointment.  When reading the first book (The Hunger games), I was able to understand why so many people found the book lovely. It had everything one could hope to want: Lots of intrigue, a big plot, and a well described terrifying journey through an evil arena.  Then, the second book: Yes, I didn't think it was quite as good as the first, but it was still very much readable. The story seemed a bit inoriginal at first, with the same plot essentially recurring twice, but the second arena was also very interesting, possibly far more so than the first.  It is at the end of the second book, that first doubts start to creep in. In an apparent rush, Suzanne Collins hurries to a quick conclusion, in a rather obvious attempt to let everyone wonder \\"What the heck just happened\\", and to wait with anticipation for the third book.  As so often happens in trilogies, however (the first is a smash hit, the second is strange, but interesting, and the third should better never have been written), so this trilogy also cannot seem to shake off the apparently unavoidable fate of a horrible third part.  Don't worry, I will spoil as little as possible, but a few details seem necessary:  To begin with, the story takes again a huge leap from where it ended last book. Katniss Everdeen has, in my opinion in this book, become completely insufferable. In the second book, her stupid antics about Peeta and Gale were already quite a pain to bear (Ooohhh I love Gale. No, wait! Peeta is such a nice guy, but Gale has been with me since the beginning! But Peeta always has his arms around me when I sleep, I need that! Oh my! Gale is jealous, I think I love him more. Damn! Peeta kissed me, that felt good. Yes! I kissed Gale too! I am going again with Peeta. Gale got hit! I need to stay with him. Peeta offered me a pearl! How cute! But Gale must be very furious by now... and on and on it goes.)  In this part, however, the endless Gale-and-Peeta Dilemma (which wasn't a Dilemma at all, if Ms. Collins hadn't decided to cook it up ad nauseaum), fades into the background, as the emotional part of the story forcuses more on Katniss. And how annoying she is. In principle, she is like an open book. All her reactions can be foreseen by the reader long before the story even gets that far. There is nothing new, she always remains the same insufferable brat she has come to be known in Book 2, with a bit more mental insanity mixed in, which is not convincingly narrated, however.  Then, the second half of the book deals with something far bigger in scope than the arena. I guess Ms. Collins decided to \\"up the ante\\" here, since apparently all those arenas were starting to get boring. This is where the author, in my humble opinion, overreaches herself. First, some events happen way too fast. In just a few pages. Things which could have kept the reader chained to the book for hours are skimmed in a few sentences, to make room for the desperate attempt to describe Katniss' inner conflicts and feelings.  In the final third part of the book (much mislabeled \\"The Assassin\\"), the story goes completely wrong altogether. The ENTIRE story builds up to one climatic moment. Ms. Collins has, by then, killed off almost all the good characters, which she took so much pain in describing in this and the last books. And then it happens: Instead of the anticipated moment, suddenly everything is over, the story makes a time-jump of at least a few weeks, and then the reader is informed in a two-page summary what all took place. The entire journey of the main character and her friends, all brought to naught, since the reader is informed that a) It wouldn't have been necessary anyway, and b) it's not even described.  Finally, Collins makes the ultimate blunder: She kills off one of THE MAJOR characters, one who's death was completely unanticipated, with no real use behind it. Normally, characters heroically sacrifice themselves to save someone else, or get killed because they have to, or anything like that. But here, the character dies without any real use or meaning behind it. A completely incoherent story about why that character was there and had to die in the first place then follows, which does not get resolved in any way.  And for what purpose, Ms. Collins, I might ask, did you do that? What the heck went through your head when you did this? The death of the character serves no purpose, since all the described emotions of Katniss Everdeen were already described in boring length in the other two books. Rue's death at least was very well staged, and almost seemed necessary. This final death at the end of the book is just stupid, annoying, and didn't even make me sad (much in contrast to Rue's death).  The final ending also is rather incoherent, and not altogether satisfying. It's certainly not one of those endings which stay with you for a lifetime because of its depth and meaning.  So, if you are here deciding whether to buy the book or not: If you have read part 2, I recommend you leave it at that. It's a bit like the Matrix: If you watched only the first, perfect. Stop there, and think that this was the end. If you watched the second, well, there is far more of a gaping cliff hanger at the end, but don't let that fool you.  If you still can't help yourself and absolutely HAVE to buy this book to know this disappointing ending, my condolences.

B00428CPUY|1.0|I received this DVD with a cracked case, DVD holder damaged such that the DVD's cannot be held firm anymore and one DVD with a crack in the center.  I cannot easily return this item as I live outside the US.  The packaging of Amazon appeared OK but this product must have been damaged at Seller's facility or earlier.  I am not happy with this despite the wonderful content of the DVD's.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I got a Kindle Fire for Christmas from a family member, being the total klutz I am, I immediately went and bought a case for it. I ended up choosing this one because of it's stunning good looks and the reviews seemed alright.  Best. Decision. Ever.  I've unfortunately dropped my poor Kindle Fire a couple times, but with this case, you can't even tell at all. The case shows no signs of damage or even scrapes. It looks just like it did when I pulled it out of the packaging. It's not incredibly thick and heavy, but it definitely stands up to the wear and tear of an early 20's, recent college graduate's hectic, crazy and accident prone life.  Not to mention it's gorgeous.
055380684X|4.0|The main theme of \\"The Talent Code\\" is that anybody can be great, but what not everybody can do is take the three steps to greatness: \\"deep practice\\", find \\"ignition\\" and enjoy the benefits of \\"master coaching\\".  It is not exactly a simple formula for success, but after 10,000 hours of practice with like-minded peers and under the supervision of qualified coaches the chance for true greatness multiply.  Other books have covered this subject before, but Coyle brings a unique perspective and style of storytelling that makes for a terrific read.<br /><br />Coyle, a contributing editor to \\"Outside\\" magazine, explains how the composers of nineteenth-century Vienna, writers of Shakespearean England and artists of the Italian Renaissance all achieved remarkable success and why other areas of the world did not.  These \\"hotbeds\\" of talent have many explanations, the first of which is deep practice.<br /><br />It is through this process of deep practice that we build skill and at the same time build myelin, which Coyle calls, \\"the holy grail of acquiring skill\\".  Much like wrapping tape around a leaky hose, myelin makes us stronger at the skill we are practicing.  Offering the three rules of deep practice - chunk it up, repeat it and learn to feel it - we get our first glimpse into what makes the talented talented.<br /><br />The second part of Coyle's talent code argument is ignition.  Ignition is \\"the moments that lead us to say that is who I want to be\\" according to Coyle, and he uses examples such as the boom in female South Korean golfers after the victories of Se Ri Pak and the similar explosion in Russian female tennis players after Anna Kournikova reached the Wimbledon semifinals.  Correlation does not equal causation, but Coyle provides compelling evidence for his theory using such disperse examples as Curaçao baseball players and the KIPP education program in inner-city schools.<br /><br />Coyle finally looks at Master Coaching or \\"the talent whisperers\\".  From expert bank robbers, John Wooden and Tom Brady's little-known quarterback coach, Coyle lays out a blueprint of coaching greatness that includes \\"The Matrix\\", \\"Perceptiveness\\", \\"The GPS Reflex\\" and \\"Theatrical Honesty\\".<br /><br />In short, Coyle seeks to explain how people have \\"cracked the talent code\\" and uses his theory of three parts - deep practice, ignition and master coaching - to explain not only how greatness happens, but in my opinion how to borrow some of these concepts in our own lives.  Coyle is clearly not a scientist writing about greatness, but rather a writer writing about the science of greatness.  This does not diminish the arguments he makes or the impact of his story.  Rather he has taken a very complex subject and distilled it to its essence and provided us all a valuable primer on greatness and where it comes from.ady's little-known quarterback coach, Coyle lays out a blueprint of coaching greatness that includes \\"The Matrix\\", \\"Perceptiveness\\", \\"The GPS Reflex\\" and \\"Theatrical Honesty\\".

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I did expect a bit more ridiculousness, however, found the book quite funny even if my expectations were a little dashed.
B00008976Y|2.0|The back cover of the DVD states she is \\"reluctantly drawn into an ever-widening web of lies and passion as he dark, secret life of her husband begins to unravel.  With each startling discovery and heartstopping surprise...\\"  I was expecting a bit of mystery and suspense or at least a wee bit of tension.  But nope...none...nada.  Julie's husband and daughter are killed in a car accident.  She survives.  She sells everything and has the cash put into an account.  From there she rents an apartment.  She doesn't want to associate with anyone; however, she ends up doing so.  She finds out her husband has a mistress (I guess that is the big secret).  She seems OK with it.  She gives the mistress her old house.  That's about it.  She spends some time in a strip club chatting with her neighbor who dances there.  She also looks at a rat tending to baby rats...she sleeps with an old friend a couple of times.  She eats ice cream and coffee.  She is always well dressed.  But nothing really interesting ever happens in the movie. She is always calm and composed and polite.  It was just sooo boring. I don't believe I have spoiled anything considering nothing much happens.  I kept expecting something interesting or some emotion to be displayed other than content...but nope...none...nada.

Will is a stellar leading man, who will live in your memory for a very long time, in spite of his profound and heartbreaking sadness. Books like this are why I love reading.

0061969656|5.0|Uhtred of Bebbanburg says something like that in the 6th volume of the Saxon Tales series.  And Bernard Cornwell spends some 315 pages proving that throughout the book.  The action starts on the first page with someone trying to kill Uhtred.  As is expected Uhtred survives at the expense of the band hired to kill him.  There is an unexpected weapon used in the process.  Witches, magicians and a Goddess add to the mix through the course of the book.  Uhtred is as wily as always, in battle and in peace.  Cornwell does his usual excellent job of portraying England as a bit of Paradise with thorns.  You smell the smoke, you feel the sword hammer on your shield, you see the blood spurt and you hear the battle thunder as well the prayers of priests.  Kings die as do commoners.  This book was a joy to read; much better than Clancy's latest effort.  And, it should be no spoiler to hear that Uhtred survives to return in book 7.  After all, Richard Sharpe was chronicled in 21 books.  Why can't Uhtred make it into double digits?  His story is at least as interesting and important to the history of England
B002C6A6N6|4.0|I bought these for my wife. We've watched them together and have enjoyed them.  Pros:  It's mostly family friendly. There is some violence, references to sexual activity (prostitution), and drinking. All of which, Dr. Quinn does not approve of.  It's a fun, light-hearted, and cheesy love show.  Cons:  Acting isn't that great, but it adds very well to the cheesiness.
B0015DROBO|2.0|I kept wanting to like this book because everyone else I talked to did but, really, I found it quite annoying.  The constant references to computer technology seemed like stilly name dropping. While the writing seemed competent enough I did not enjoy this book at all.
0553805371|2.0|This book declares philosophy is dead and then proceeds to answer the age-old questions of why do we exist? Why is there something and not nothing? etc. The book has a condescending view toward religion. It proceeds to cover the multi-verse theories using M-theory and quantum mechanics. There is nothing new here. It does explain some of the physics rather well, but I found Greene's books more interesting and more enlightening. In the end, the book doesn't give meaning, but rejoices that we are in a universe out of an infinite number of universes whose history we determine as we discover more about our universe.  There are other better books out there.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I purchased this cover a few days ago for my Kindle Fire.  After reading all the reviews I chose this over the leather cover, due to the price.  I have purchased in the past high reviewed products that was least expensive, and returned the product.  I was skeptical due to my previous experience, but decided to go ahead and order this cover.  It was easy to install and fits the Kindle Fire perfect.  I also like the additional features, the stand, and the band to hold with your hand.  I would highly recommend this cover.  It is not leather, but for the price it is a great cover.  I also like the pink cover, it is easy to locate when you have a bright color as the cover.

B002PEP4SC|3.0|I'm a big fan of Castle, so I was very interested in reading the book \\"supposedly\\" written by him.  It didn't live up to my expectations, unfortunately.  The writing was stiff.  The author(s) failed to grab my emotions.  I found that the similarities between the characters in the book and the characters in the show were more distracting than fun, because they were close but not quite there, and I had to try to keep things straight.  I also felt there were some point-of-view issues.  All that said, I read through to the end and didn't consider quitting.  So, it was okay but I doubt I'll read another in this series.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Fun and easy to use! Love the 1 player computer difficultly ajuster. Truthfully, the peices could be much larger, and undo button seems kind of stupid. However it was a well rounded game that I keep begging people to play with me.

0446573019|2.0|The first 80% of the book was good, and I would have recommended it. But, the ending was implausible, dragged out, uninteresting and spoiled the whole experience for me. I ended up thumbing through the pages on my iPad, and throwing it into the archives. It is very puzzling to me, how an experienced writer and all of his publishing team could buy into such a wimped-out, predictable and uninteresting ending.
1933492953|5.0|The book is laid out in a clear and comfortable style and has really fantastic artwork that's easy to follow. One of my favorite illustration books. It has a large section on compositions that's really great and a little bit on character design, camera lens, ect. Really good for any kind of sequential art, I use it for helping come up with more creative compositions for my storyboards.
B001GM7G8K|5.0|It's too bad more recordings are not offered like this one.  SHM simply adds an \\"oomph\\" to any recording it's used for.  I have other SACD's using this and it provides a level of depth you would not believe.  I'm not a technical reviewer,meaning I don't claim to be a \\"professional.\\" I solely go by what my ears hear and how I like it.  I liked Long Road Out of Eden as a regular CD.  All Eagles fans had been clammoring for years for any release, and when I heard about it I rushed out to buy it.  I played it for days.  I didn't care about previous musical \\"roads\\" they took, all I wanted to hear was what ended up on the CD--and The Eagles singing it.  Track after track is simply great regardless of who is doing the lead vocal.  I lived in Japan for 6 years and frequently went to music shops while there, neither SHM nor SACD was widely available then.  What I did notice was the great number of choices the same CD or release had...record, CD. etc. and on different types of materials you would not see in the U.S.  Cost-wise, this was considerably higher than a regular CD but to me, if you like the artist like I do The Eagles, it was a no-brainer to get a copy on SHM.  I wish more companies behind CD releases would offer a limited pressing using this material as well as a regular CD, I would become a steady buyer.  It would be fantastic to see the latest \\"greatest hits\\" package come out on SHM also.  To sum this up...\\"Long Road Out of Eden\\" is F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C on this medium so buy it...grab that beverage of choice, crank up the stereo and get lost.......

0385341008|5.0|I LOVED this book! I had my guesses how it would end, and let's just say that I'm happy. :)<br /><br />I will have to re-read this. I read it in less then 24 hours, I couldn't put it down. And I am fascinated about the war facts of this. I know the author did lots of research and it was mind blowing to me to see what people have gone thru in WWII. Def makes one appreciate life as we know it now even more. I loved the fictional characters and the witty and quirky personalities. LOVED this book....<br /><br />My only complaint is that it ended very suddenly. This happened, I believe, since the author had failing health. I think she would have had it go on much longer had she not been sick and passed away. Thank heavens she wrote as much as she did. I ::so:: wish there were a sequel to this book. But does not look like that's in the cards. Such a great read! :)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love love LOVE it! its such a challenging game that will keep you entertained for hours! I normally wouldn't pay $1.99 for an app, but this was completely worth it! it runs beautifully on my Kindle Fire :)
1416550550|5.0|Such a cool book. It's a mystery - that is not too freaky, which I loved! The only thing that took some getting used to, is how the book switches back and forth (ALL the time) between multiple characters POV from multiple time periods. It's quite fragmented - you get used to a character, then it's back to a different character 100 years later. It is well written besides that fact, and I love the overall story that fits together so well, once you read the whole book (which is 550ish pages - it's been a minute since I have read anything over 300-400 pages).  I thought I had several parts figured out and was pleasantly surprised to see I was wrong (I like books that can surprise me!). I was gasping in a few places with surprise towards the very end (meanwhile, my hubby is teasing me saying,\\"It's the Butler who did it, in the Drawing room, with the Candlestick.... LOL), and I was happy with how it all ended - it has good has closure. Def alot adversity in this book and some very creepy characters who are bad along with some ultra cool characters who are so good, but overall, it's the feel good book I was seeking after reading the Hunger Games series... LOVED this book. I will def have to re-read it again sometime. I highly recommend this book! :)  For spoliers, scroll below:  Okay, the character, Linus. Awk! He is SOOO creepy! Def in the top 5 of all time creepy characters for me. And it almost implies that he is Jack the Ripper.... which is so scary! And I think he was into his sister, ewe! And pretty much into his niece - which is SO sick and wrong.... ewe.... LOVED the character of Eliza Makepeace. SO cool. Amazing to me what Eliza sacrificed for her cousin. So sad... And the Nathaniel character, he was just cool, as well! Such a good, good book! :)

B005JZBPHS|2.0|My partner and I have been together for many years now and we had never seen or even talked about the L Word--ever. The show has been off the air for a couple of years and had basically left my consciousness altogether, so I was surprised when the COMPLETE SERIES showed up on my doorstep. Since then, I have been subjected to one of the worst shows to ever hit the television screen--gay or straight. The character of Jennifer \\"Debbie Oxnard\\" Schecter has to be one of the miserable and wholly unappealing ever written. Why Ilene Chaiken felt that America should be introduced to Miss Schecter is beyond my comprehension--the fact that Chaiken admittedly based Schecter on herself is even more confounding. I am not better or worse for being exposed to this character, just out several hours of my life that I can never get back.  Leaving the Schecter character out of it, the L Word continually brought up important and complicated issues only to barely deal with them, and in the most superficial of manners at that. In fact, I kept waiting for Carrie Bradshaw's voice to come in and say, \\"and just like that, Kit's abortion/relapse/homicidal thoughts were over.\\" Wow, great! Glad we tackled those issues! Phew! Give me a break. In the end, the only things that kept me going were Alice's one-liners and Bette's hotness (minus the sometimes ridiculous hair/wardrobe).  All in all, the L Word proved to be a disappointing waste of time and missed opportunity by Ilene Chaiken. Of course, could more truly be expected from the writer of Barb Wire?
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I have no idea why people are leaving bad reviews, I love it! It runs great and I've had no problems with it on my Kindle Fire. The graphics look wonderful on the larger screen!
B005V20JKI|5.0|I bought the game because it looked a little like Mario Brothers... while it is nothing like Mario after all, I really ended up digging it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|To be completely honest, some big named, popular books come across as hard to understand and frustrating to me. Maybe it's because they simply didn't live up the everyone's hype about it.<br />But this book was completely different! I loved everything about it. Its not the genre I usually would pick up, but I'm sure glad I did.<br />I will definitely be purchasing book #2! Do not hesitate to by this book!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was lucky enough to get this app when it was the free app of the day but would gladly pay the 4.99 any time for it... it is simple to use and truly lets you have complete control over your home computer(s)... I will install on every device that is compatible! This is definitely a must have!
B0015DROBO|3.0|While I finally enjoyed this book after it was half way over with,  it was great. But up until then, I caught myself constantly having to refer back to the family tree diagram and previous chapters. It was frustrating for me.<br />I am an avid reader, and this has to be the hardest book I've ever read. I usually take 2 to 3 days on a book and this took me 3 weeks. I had to constantly convince myself to pick it up. It truely only got exciting at the end, but it still left me disappointed.
1451648537|3.0|About 90% of the book is about Jobs' life with Apple, how he obsessed about the design of the products (Mac, iPod, iPad, etc) and his dealings with many business people. 10% is devoted to his family life. After a time, I was bored reading about the same process that went with each product development. I think the book would have been more interesting if it equally focused details on his private life with Powell and their children; after all, they were married for 20 years.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I throughly enjoyed this book.  Since I couldn't put it down, I finished it in about a day and a half.  I loved how I could relate to the main female in the story.<br />On the negative, I found the story to be a bit stressful. All the fighting about drove me crazy! And the sex..without the use of condoms. I understand there is a warning when you purchase the book, but do you think that would stop younger readers from purchasing it? I mean, some adults still don't grasp the concept of 'safe sex'. The ending & epilogue seems a little silly, especially after seeing how his childish the couple was.<br />All in all, it wasn't a bad read. It definitely kept me entertained!:)
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Works great, install was a teeny tiny bit of a pain, but that was more my fault then the fault of the cooler itself, I could've unmounted my mobo, but decided not to, and did it the more difficult way, lol. My CPU at full load tops out at 44c, while at idle it sits right around 24c, I tested it overnight with prime95 and it stayed at 44c. My CPU is an AMD Athlon II X4 645. It fits JUST perfectly in my case as well. (Rosewill challenger) Check out the customer images for what mine looks like, it's the last one posted.

014312093X|5.0|The present edition was issued after release of the film. I must confess that I did not fully understand the intrigue after having seen the film, but the book gave me the full picture. The book and the film are so different that they should be regarded and criticized as two separate pieces of art. The book must be read slowly, and every name in it must be remembered. John le Carr&eacute; does not tell you every detail, and forces the reader to draw his/her own conclusions throughout the book, also in the end. There is hardly any violence, but a fascinating intrigue where pure logic and human feelings are ingeniously mixed together in two interdependent stories: one one hand politics, diplomacy and secret service, and on the other George Smiley's relationship to his unfaithful wife.

B006MHWXMS|1.0|Why in the world would you set an app to uninstall the old version &amp; then install an updated version?  I expect an update to be just that!  A minor modification to the software that doesn't compromise data.  I've never (til now) seen an app on any platform (windows, linux, android, mac, etc) prompt for an &quot;UPDATE&quot; then uninstall, reinstall, and leave me with total data loss!  Man, I  didn't even get a &quot;this'll erase your tasks&quot; warning!  I'm in shock!  Anyway, til the bullcrap upgrade I was very happy with this program!  It was doing everything I needed it to do!  Of course, none of that matters after the so called &quot;update&quot; wiped out all my data.  Needless to say I for sure, won't be updating this app anymore!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I was shocked to read so many poor reviews of this amazing book. I only recently discovered this series, and read all 5 books in under three months (with a full-time job and 4 little kids, I even hid out in the bathroom so I could finish the chapter)! I think that Dance with Dragons was the best so far. Anything Tyrion does is entertaining: surviving imprisonment in the Eyrie, running Westeros from Kings Landing or traversing Essos in search of Daenerys. He was sorely missed in book 4 and I was glad to see him, as well as other amazing characters like Daenerys, Jon and Theon back here.<br /><br />As for the complaints regarding the Daenerys story-line: yes, she is a teenage girl swooning over the dashing but wrong guy. She repeatedly attests that \\"I am only a young girl\\", and she is. Therefore a crush on the good-looking, exciting guy is completely within character, and makes her character more believable. She is also an extraordinary young girl, with a capability to lead and inspire, to advance causes she believes in, and to captivate people's hearts and imaginations. Having a teenage crush just makes her human.<br /><br />The Cersei scene was outstanding- the description of how her strech marks, her sagging breasts turned her from the god-like monarch into just a woman says a lot about how we view women. Her struggling and failing to stay above it all was the perfect end for the villianess, and her commitment to her children left just enough humanity in her character to make her human. For all those who complained about only one Jaime chapter- I think that was just thrown in to show his state of mind, his drive to promote peace and to find Sansa Stark, as well as his desire to avoid Cersei and their relationship. Without that insight you would be wondering why he didn't come to Cersei's aid after receiving her raven.<br /><br />Everyone who claimed that \\"the book doesn't go anywhere\\" is missing the point. The plot of Westeros NEVER ends, just like in life. One character dies, another rises to glory, in a never-ending struggle for power, revenge and influence. I wouldn't mind another 10 books in this vein. George RR Martin's unbelievable imagination, attention to detail, outstanding character development and his riveting writing style could keep me happy in Westeros and Essos for years!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a beasty game. I love it . it is so entertaining I love I because it gives me.something to do
B004MC8CA2|5.0|For being a free bible app. This is the best I have found. Even the paid ones don't compare. Very well planned and built.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I bought this cover as gift for my brother's wife kindle fire. The cover fitted perfectly. At first the cover didn't close completely, it took a while for the leather to loosen. The cover is well designed and made of premium material. I recommended to anybody looking for an elegant cover for their kindle not wanting any \\"stand\\" features in the cover.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|My mother-in-law said that she didn't have trouble with her hearing.

She now admitt that she can hear  a lot better. and is going to make a appointment to get her hearing  checked. The Sonic Super Ear. Has made a difference in her hearing.
B005QUQRE2|5.0|I really liked this movie a lot.  It had a great story line.  The acting was great.  People are either going to love this movie or hate it.  \\"Another Earth\\" in some ways reminded me of the movie \\"Gattaca\\" of which moved me a lot. I think overall this movie is as good or even better. I would highly recommend seeing it.  Damn, no \\"CGI\\".  I was really hoping for more \\"monkeys\\" and \\"blue people with tails\\" swinging through trees!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its okay.  I like it because u get free games.Ps I only did the for the coins yyyyyeeaaa so uh forces of war is better
B000LC55F2|5.0|First of all, Christian Bale, without a doubt, is one of the most drop-dead gorgeous guys on the face of this earth who has also got charming talent for acting behind a movie camera! I have watched him since I first discovered him a long time ago back in 1990 when he starred in Treasure Island with Charlton Heston. Christian was so cute as a boy and really grew up into a major heartthrob! I have seen him in Batman,Rescue Dawn and American Psycho as well as The Prestige and he is excellent in all these films. He can always deliver an outstanding performance in whatever role he takes on. He is totally convincing in every role, especially in The Prestige, playing a magician. I recommend this to all Bale fans.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|excellent... usefull, neat and it msked it easy to use and share etc etc.  would rwccommend always go eagles wow
B001UOVP1S|2.0|Chris has spoken about his sobriety in interviews and I am wondering if this musical experimentation is a substitute for his drug use? If so then it is definately the right choice and path. He can sing anything and sound good. I for one am used to Soundgarden and Temple of The Dog, but I am open minded enough to embrace this side of Chris' sound as I did with Live. Chris Cornell and Timbaland, although a weird combo, is also not a bad one.
1451627289|5.0|I haven't read Stephen King books in years.  Someone at work said they were reading this book and it was good so I thought I'd give it a try.  I had just finished Hunger Games and wasn't really excited to read the 2nd or 3rd books in that series.  This book was amazing.  I had to force myself to put it down late at night so I could get some sleep!  There are only a couple of spots where King's liberal views get put into words, and its quickly forgotten by the pace of the plot.  Its almost like a runaway train.... going faster and faster... until the end.  The ending was good and the whole book leaves you wondering... what if?  One thing I would have liked to learn more about was the bubbles and their guardians.  And who trained them?  Could be a whole book just on that topic... maybe.  I felt like the book could have continued on another 200-300 pages and it still wouldn't have been too long.  :)<br /><br />It'll be a while before I find another book as good as 11/22/63!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|A must have program works great. Works on all my computers. If your wanting to stay connected I would reccommend this program I use it for work and home.
B000M2O6AQ|2.0|Started out not too bad with fairly interesting plot, but made less sense as the movie continued. Found myself looking at the clock to see when it would end. Watched until the end hoping for some \\"wow-factor\\" ending, but it was a little bit disappointing. There were several scenes within the movie where it felt like they were explaining (their) religion to you, although it was intended for the character nodding his head in understanding. The movie plot really was kinda poor since the main theme seemed to be to share this religious outlook with you and to fashion it into a story somehow that didn't quite flow so well. Wasn't the worst religious movie I've seen, but was just below entertaining for me and if I could, I would take back those two hours of my life. Would have preferred to learned about this religion (read or watched) something more direct instead of seeing this somewhat cheezy, low-budget film that it was delivered though. Just my opinion though.
B0063IH60K|5.0|GREAT GAME.  ADDICTIVE  LOTS OF FUN!  HOURS OF FUN. PLAY THIS EVERY NIGHT . RELAXING ENOUGH AND CALMING TOO.  WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ALL AGES.

0385534639|5.0|If you are going to read one book this year, it should be Night Circus.  The storyline was orginal and the ending delightful.  It was a very well written book.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Before seeing this film, I had absolutely no preconceived ideas about it.  The only exception to this statement was that I was aware that it was written and directed by Woody Allen.  Beyond this, I knew nothing.<br /><br />To my very pleasant surprise, I absolutely loved this film!  It was whimsical, funny and clever.  In essence, it covers a trip to Paris by an engaged American couple played by Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams.  Despite being engaged, they are quite different people. She is the sometimes petulant daughter of her whining parents who are travelling with the couple.  Owen Wilson as Gil, is a Hollywood screed writer who dreams of writing a great novel and longs to live in the bohemian Paris of the 1920s.  A time when Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald lived in the city and mixed with Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Paul Gaugin and others.<br /><br />The trick that Allen uses to enhance the story is that each evening, Gil is actually able to travel back in time. He meets and mixes with his heroes.  Perhaps this sounds absurd but Allen manages to pull it off.  The result is very funny.  No one from the 1920s suspects that Gil is a traveller from another time although his fianc&eacute;e and parents think he must be crazy.  He must be delusional.<br /><br />If the film has any message it is that people often yearn for earlier times.  We all speak of the good old days.  However, the good old days were rarely good.  Even Gil can identify that in the 1920s there were no antibiotics. For all its romance, earlier times were not without there drawbacks.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this film.  Owen Wilson as Gil is a revelation and Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein is terrific.  This is a top piece of modern cinema.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the title says it all. especially for the price. I wish more Christians practiced this type of business model. thanks

0345472322|2.0|I hate self-help books, not because I don't think I need them but because of their standard format: propose an entirely logical hypothesis about behavior that anyone with half a brain cell could figure out on his or her own, (this is the part that makes me hate them) provide as many examples as you can find that support your theory, and then explain to readers how they can alter their behavior to fit the profile. Such is the case with this book that theorizes that those with a \\"growth\\" mindset, that is, those willing to take risks (instead of avoiding them due to fear of failure), make mistakes (and learn from them), welcome constructive criticism (instead of resenting the feedback) and, most importantly, believe that effort (vice innate intelligence) can make all the difference when it comes to success in parenting, business, school and relationships. There you go, now you can save yourself the trouble of reading the book. The time you save would be better spent reading: Columbine by David Cullen (to get the real story about what the teen killers were and did, which Ms. Dweck got wrong), anything by Rafe Esquith (my favorite being Teach Like Your Hair's on Fire), or Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a fantastic book.  Suzanne Collins is very skilled at creating a world where ridiculously cool things have happened. I really loved the character description in the book as well as the way that the setting was described.  The Hunger Games within the book was extremely thrilling and filled with suspense.  The way that Katniss' and Peeta's relationship changes throughout the story was captivating and sucked me in so that I didn't want to put the book down. This bok made me want to read the rest of the series and I mustsay that the second two books are equally thrilling and captivating.  This book was so fantastic that I wish I could give it six stars. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good thrilling story with a captivating ending.
0307346617|5.0|Have you ever wondered what our world would look like after a major worldwide crisis?  I don't mean a small localized event, I mean some catastrophe that touched the entire planet.  The stories in this book, while obviously dealing with the living dead, are rich with a surprising amount of details, and real-life scenarios that could very easily apply to a pandemic, or some other wide scale event.  The author took the time to do his research and it shows. Entertainment no doubt, but many of these stories remind us just how disconnected many people have become from reality.  The very things that have made life so easy and convenient for so many in the 21 century, have become the Achilles Heel that might one day bring it all crashing down. I enjoyed this book and was sorry when I reached the last page.

B001NFNFIK|3.0|Tommy Lee Jones tracks a serial killer preying on young women; at the same time he's also thinking about a 40-year-old killing of a black escapee. Ultimately, the two are traced to the same source.<br /><br />The movie was interesting at first, but suffers from a few inexplicable 'plotholes,' being overly complex, playing up Jones' non-racist background, and unrealistic levels (for today) of blacks fear of cooperating with police investigations. Somehow Hurricane Katrina gets dragged into the plot as well.

0307959856|5.0|I have to differ from most other reviewers and say that this worked for me on all levels.  James captures Austen's language, characters and sense of place perfectly.  It is a sly delight and I especially loved the side references to the Elliot's, the Knightley's and others.  It felt like a seamless continuation of these wonderful characters and their story but wrapped in a murder mystery.  But while the pacing and events are faithful to Austen, I can understand how modern readers may not appreciate it.  For me, it was a complete success - thanks, Baroness!

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|i spent many years watching foreign films in art houses.  i got hooked on the authenticity of seeing a film in its natural setting and in its own language.  i barely registered after awhile that i was reading subtitles. thus, when this hugely successful swedish novel was made into a swedish film, i loved it.  i loved the novel and its sequels too. surprisingly, many americans who don't usually like subtitled films, loved it too, i just assumed no one would be interested in remaking a rather perfect experience.  i was wrong.  we remade it in our languaage, set it in sweden but had the actors speak english.  some of these actors adopted swedish accents for, ahem, authenticity. on the plus side, at least a first rate director, david fincher, was at the helm.<br /><br />it is a good film.  how much you like it will depend on whether you've seen the swedish film. the swedish film was the novel brought to life.  the american film isn't simply because it is american. however, if you hate subtitles, don't like foreign films much and in general like american remakes of foreign films, then this is the version for you.<br /><br />here's the plot: a wealthy industrialist wants the murder of Harriet, a young relative missing for decades and presumed dead., finally solved.  he perceives a disgraced journalist as his best bet as a detective.  he makes him an offer too ample to refuse and we are off and running. as our amateur detective keeps digging, it appears that a serial killer is involved. joining him in this investigation is lisabeth salander.  she takes over the movie just as she took over the book and swedish film.  she is a very complex young woman with staggering computer abilities. she also has some staggering problems which begin to unfold. the young woman playing her in the film is outstanding,  i can't decide which actress i like best in her role.  we all know daniel craig is a great actor but he doesn't even come close to what this actress pulls off in this film. she even makes me believe she is swedish, which craig never does.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

1878424505|5.0|I received this book as a gift over a decade ago, and have since reread it several times. I've also given it as a gift to at least 50 people. The wisdom is so incredibly easy to understand, yet it takes years of practice to really get it right...I hope I'm almost there!! I used to take things personally and assume things like it was natural. It's SO incredibly unnatural and was the cause of so much pain and drama. Don Miguel Ruiz, I am forever grateful to you for writing this book. You changed the course of my entire life for the better.

B00511ONPG|5.0|Dave Kerpen has done all small business owners a great service by writing this book. This is one of the best books out there and I put it in my top 5 on social media. I have read a lot of books on Social Media lately, but none come close to this one.<br /><br />Kerpen highlights the importance of listening and tells you how to think like a consumer. He expands on how to create a true conversation with your customers by inviting them to be your first fans, and how to respond to both good and bad criticism. The advice Dave gives to small business owners is invaluable. Kerpen tells you how to be honest and transparent with your customers and how to provide real value by listening to what your customers really want.<br /><br />The best part of this book is how Kerpen provides a blueprint for integrating Social Media into the entire customer experience. It is not just about public relations, it is about making lasting relationships with your customers. You have to be truthful, admit when you mess up, and respond quickly to complaints.<br /><br />Dave provides a quick acronym for TWEET<br />- Trust-building by building relationships<br />- Wisdom by learning what industry leaders are doing<br />- Ears Open by listening to the conversation<br />- Establish your brand by creating a strong presence on the net & community<br />- Teaching the world about what you do.<br /><br />And that is your mission, if you chose to accept it. If you do that, then you are creating `Likeable Social Media' and that is the premise of the book.<br /><br />I have read over 20 books on Social Media and \\"Likeable Social Media\\" tops them all. Reviewed on IntelJim dot com.
B0000A5BSW|5.0|The greatest western of all-time. It never gets old watching this old classic. Superb acting, cinematography, etc.  I had to buy it twice not paying attention to \\"Region 2\\" on the title.  My bad.  It only plays on players in Asia. Oh well...live and learn.  I bought the English version soon after and it was worth the extra bucks to cover my blunder.  Great, great movie.
0307744434|1.0|This book was recommended as a read for a book club. I'm not a fantasy fan, but I decided to try reading something outside my normal interests. I went in with the idea of reading something new.<br />I will say that this story had a lot of interesting elements. I enjoyed the author's ideas and the plot idea. It certainly had a lot going for it. I enjoyed and was intrigued by the first few chapters, but toward the middle, I started to notice a few things that started to irritate me. First, there wasn't much happening. The book relies heavily upon descriptions that are indeed imaginative and fun, but the characters she has in the book do not really do much. I can only assume that the author's intention was to make the Circus the main character and the rest supporting characters. If that is the case, she didn't do it well enough. I kept tapping my foot waiting for something to happen. I have just a few pages left and I find myself skipping over unnecessary paragraphs that lag the \\"action\\" going on. I also found the jumping around to be very unorganized. As an example, sometimes she will open the chapter with someone doing something, but she does not specify who the character is until a few sentences in the paragraph. Because the book skips so much, I started to lose track of who was when and where. Eventually, I gave that up and it was a little more manageable.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is the descriptive writing. Great novels and stories rely on the classic cliche: \\"Show, don't tell.\\" The author does a LOT of telling rather than showing. If she does \\"show\\" she explains the obvious = tell. There were a few terms that started to make me say, \\"Oh come on!\\" out loud several times. The term \\"Save For\\" was used SO much that I decided to do a search in my Nook for how many times it comes up -- 3 pages of results. Also, for some time - 3 pages of results. Because she spends a majority of the book describing the circus in detail, she repeats the phrase \\"save for\\" or \\"save\\" todescribe things.<br />For example: Pg 72: \\"...is no sound at all save for the rustle of silk...\\";<br />pg 78: \\"it is empty save for two people...\\" pg 79: \\"...shoulders and arms completely bare save for...\\"... You get the idea.  pg 144: \\"is unsure if anyone, save himself...\\", A variation of it appears on pages: 9, 10, 19, 25, 34, 63, 72, 78, 79, 101, 116, 123, 127, 144, 148, 169, 201, 203. I think the author could have benefited from an excellent editor who would have made her descriptions much more fluid.<br />I also noticed some strange \\"action\\" descriptions that I won't get into because I don't want to appear like I am picking this novel apart. (Too late?)<br /><br />I think this book is entertaining if you take it for what it is and at its value. It is a mainstream novel geared toward fantasy fans who read these books for the adventure and other worldly experiences; not those looking for a well-polished novel with deep characterization and a plot that makes you keep turning the pages.
0547258305|5.0|I will say this book caught me by surprise. I have had this on my books to read list for a while but never got around to it. Well I finally decided to read it and boy was I happy I did. I could not put this book down. Seriously I got so caught up in it I stayed up reading all night! It was such a unique story that I was so enthralled by. I also loved Katsa because she was a strong female lead (but also very stubborn and not always logical). I will say for a young adult book it does deal with some heavy topics at times. Just with discreet sex scenes or verbal abuse to women. But these elements were not a focal point of the book and they were in reflection of the time this story took place. Overall this was such a great read. I will say that I was thrown by the ending but I didn't find it bad just unexpected. This was such a great read and one of the few books I could whole heartedly recommend to people.
0307593495|2.0|This is a cold war era mystery. Like one of the reviewers stated this is a melancholy story. I have to confess I couldn't get through it. It made me as tired as the protagonist. I am normally fairly patient with thrillers but this read more like a memoir. Fans of the author or the series may enjoy it but I cannot recommend it.
1439156816|5.0|Where do I start? Stephen King provides a great look into the life of a writer and what it takes to be successful at the art.  I have read many books on the subject of learning how to write and have yet to find one that reads as well as this one. While it is somewhat unfair to categorize the book with the others on the subject of the art of writing, as it does include a short memoir on how the \\"king\\" got started in the industry. I was able to read this entire book in three sittings, and plan on re-reading (several times) as I continue down the path of becoming a published novelist.  The book is broken out into three distinct parts 1) The Memoir of Mr. King and how he got started, this was VERY interesting, 2) The actual techniques and tools he uses to craft novels, with quite a few references of \\"what not to do\\", which I found very helpful, 3) Living, which is about his near death experience after being struck by a van while walking.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to write successfully, as well as those individuals that enjoy learning about their favorite or popular authors. I know I was greatly entertained!
0743297334|5.0|It's all been said in other reviews.  I'll only add that if you've read this book once, it's not enough.  Read it every few years.  It just gets better and better.

0062060554|2.0|I loved a lot about this book, starting with the premise.  It gripped me from the first page.  The writing, too, is very good.  Spare, quiet--it's not the over-the-top or just plain bad genre writing you see much of in Mystery novels.  Still, I couldn't help but feel that while the premise was the best part of the novel, it was also the worst.  The frame of memory loss hamstrung the book making it feel very claustrophobic and limited.  It was clear early on this was  who-dunnit.  I would have preferred less focus on who and more focus on the psychological aspects of her condition.  It's in these moments that book transcends simple airport fiction and rises to literature.  All in all, a good effort but I wouldn't read it twice, nor recommend it.

0316069884|5.0|That's why I read this book; I wanted to know what I'm ingesting and what I'm feeding to my daughter and my husband.  For the health of my friends and family, I've started buying this book for them, hoping that they will read it. You don't have to care about the abused and mutilated animals, the massive waste lagoons polluting surrounding communities and water sources, but we should all care about our health and there is plenty to worry about when eating factory farmed animals.
