B009LREA1S|5.0|Nolan and the writers do a great job of tying everything together to make the mythology complete unto itself.  Very well done
B00992CF6W|5.0|You pay 4 dollars a gallon for gasoline and it only takes you 20 miles. But you pay 7 dollars for minecraft and it takes you an infintite amount of creative distance.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that my own creativity is not as powerful as infinity.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Honestly, how can you not love a collection of superheroes put to film albeit the budget requirements must have been huge.  Its funny and easily enjoyable
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Another wonderful author. Just when you think the story has no depth, Lee Child figures out a way to take nothing and turn it into another great adventure. I just cannot picture Tom Cruise in the title role.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|From the preview, I figured this movie would touch on the subjects of exogenesis and really dig into some of the theories behind that.  Great movie for the acting and the special effects, but I hoped for deeper examination of the underlying premise.
B00000ILDF|5.0|I love these movies and now I have all of them. Great movie. The 4th one is my favorite. Cool
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is just what i needed.  My other cable was not fitting right in the opening and thus not getting fully charged.  Now I can get my kindle fully charged.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|This movie is an okay movie but I couldn't not get this for the collection. Not bad of a movie
B006LSZECO|2.0|The beginning set a twisted plot that kept me turning the pages.  However, it became hard to continue reading as the plot and characters got more and more unrealistic towards the middle.  The ending it just absolutely horrible! Wish I would've borrowed the book from someone instead of buying.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story. Great characters. Love the entire series and contesting see the rest of the movies. Wish we didn't have to wait so long
0425252868|5.0|For years the reason for War has haunted me.  Only a child when the 2nd World War came to us in the United States, I wondered why, who, what would lead a country into a World War?  For years I searched for answers,then I stumbled on a review of this book which gripped my throat!  Yes, the story gripped my throat, I choked up...here was a true story of human thoughts and emotions better than our best writers can conjure up.  The German side and the American side is laid out before our eyes, as the crippled bomber with a severely injured crewman tries to fly across \\"The Wall\\".  Heaven had to be instrumental to allow this severely damaged plane to keep flying.  As the wounded plane approaches the heavily fortified coast of Germany to begin its dash back to England, a German fighter appears and rides it's wing.  An  incredible act of human kindness and bravery, it still brings tears to my eyes as I write this.  I learned of scenes I could never imagine , that  we flew missions with as many as 500 and then 1000 bombers, with a team of defensive fighters met by 400 fighters as we approached Germany!  Wow, I had no idea...there is so much to this story, I could not put the book down, my eyes where fighting me as sleep finally overcame my excitement.  Guaranteed the read of the year, it has to be a movie! I learned most of all that not everyone wanted war, and that a country had spun out of control, leading everyone to disaster!<br /><br />Madlyn Fafard<br />author
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks but this by far is my favorite novel of his. With each page there is a new adventure of the story line that keeps you on your toes.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This a great read. I have recommend this book to my family and friends to read.<br />Buy it today now
B00992CF6W|5.0|AWESOMENESSSSSSS. It takes a few minutes to be  the hang of the controls, yes, and the tool bar is different but wow. I love it. The HD view is the new  I have ever seen Mc. Hoping for updates&lt;3
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love this app, more then what I expected. I travel a long way to work and knowing the weather of all the big or small towns I pass through at a touch of my finger is great.
B003VTZSFY|5.0|This book is a gem for a world history buff.  The writer does not start his east-west comparisons from 16th or 18th century, but from all the way from the Ice Age, some 12500 y. ago. He has developed a socio-economic rating for the cultures he examines, and then tests it-succssfully- against real history. West is what we historically consider west to be-Europe and its environment. He considers Mid-East ( fertile crescent) which he calls &#34;Hilly Flanks&#34; to belong to west. East is mainly China and its sphere of influence.  Geography is destiny: West started about 2000 years ahead, but East gained slowly and by the Fall of Rome, it surged ahead. But by about the time of American Independence, West gained ahead again, for now. It is interesting to read how and why all this happened, and it seems all plausible. Thought provoking, anyway.  I have recommended this book to lots of my bookish friends, and also, have given it as gifts.
0345803485|1.0|I took the plunge and bought the book on Kindle and decided to read it even though I insisted I never would. Now, I ask myself why, why, why? No exaggeration, I read 100's of books per year.  I read 4-7 books at a time.  I am an ecclectic reader, not privy to any one genre; I like the written word, period.  I have read some very amazing books written by incredible authors and many have been on the New York Times Bestseller List and sadly, many have not.  I know, as an author and reader, that all it takes to get on the NYT Bestseller List is to outsell other titles; it doesn't mean the book is a great read.  All it means is that the author has such great publicists that they were able to get the book in every bookstore, get it mass-produced and in everyone's hands.  But, first they needed to convince you that it was fabulous.  I want to get to know this author's publicist; not because I need to get a bad read to the masses but because if they can do this kind of publicity for such trashy writing, mine will soar to number one!<br />There aren't enough compelling, negative words to use to describe this book.  If you've bought it, burn it; it's only good as fuel for the fireplace.  If you've downloaded it to your Kindle, delete it.  It really doesn't deserve to be printed much less read.  I give every book a fighting chance; who knows, the author might just be trying to captivate me; but, after reading 5 chapters of this book I could only think one thing, 'are you serious?'<br />Please don't go see the movie!! This will only inspire her to write more trash and make her a millionaire, 'Oh! Jeez! (she says while biting her lip) 'maybe it'll make her a billionaire!!' Please, please, please don't give this author any more reason to put her fingers on the keyboard of her computer and write more!  This book is 100% garbage!!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app is very useful. It works well for ebooks. It also comes in handy for other things. I use it a lot.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Love the movie. as good as the first and cant wait for part 3! dont know why people hate this one.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Well scripted, well acted...This movie is a joy to watch from start to finish. It captures the wonderful, tender, funny, intense, naive, honesty of early adolescence.
1608871452|5.0|I LOVE this show and LOVED this book.  Every SUPERNATURAL fan show have thsi book. Great pictures and little extras that are not included in any other SUPERNATURAL books I owen.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for xmas. We sat down  that night and watched it. It was super cute! We both enjoyed it very much.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|After waiting for this book I wish I didn't have to wait until the next one comes . Please hurry and finish the story. I learned more about world history from these two books than from all the history classes I have taken.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very easy read. This book is even better than the movie because there are more details and allows your imagination to take over.
0451232852|5.0|Cleverly written, I couldn't wait to turn each page to see what would happen next. I highly recommend this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very easy read. This book is even better than the movie because there are more details and allows your imagination to take over.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Let me begin by stating I am no film critic, but I am someone who enjoys a varierty of movies.This movie is simply wonderful! It has a great story played out by some of Britain's finest actors/actresses. I originally saw this with a friend and then later showed it to my husband and father in law (who rarely ever finds newer movies entertaining) and both loved it.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Just like the old game. I have yet to master it, but it sure is fun trying. I really like the fact that I can play it where ever I am.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A family member talked me into this book. After reading several other dystopian novels I wasn't really excited about this one. This book had some slow parts, but overall kept me guessing. I am always nervous about how these types of stories will end, but this one was worth the time and emotion invested. I can see this story being picked up and made into a film.
B009JBZH54|5.0|For 25 bucks I cannot complain. The behind the scenes features are great too. Grwpat three movies on bluray for 25 bucks what's not to like?
B007RTAR64|5.0|Bought this for a gift. Very detailed. Looks exactly like the actress. Has some small harts so becareful if you are buying for a small child.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This is a fun and unique game!  I named my stick figure Skippy and it makes me laugh at the adventures.  For free it is worth to pass the time.
B0052YAKS6|1.0|not my cup of tea at all i'm a classical fan and haven't listened to it  younsters would probably enjoy the noise
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|When I first saw the title &#34;Walking Dead&#34; I thought, B actors, who cares? But the actors are very good.<br />The story line is very good. A virus has developed that infects the body , which ultimately kills, and then reanimates dead people. They become modern day Zombies. Sure it's crazy! But watch one episode and you'll want to see more.
1419705849|4.0|Well Jeff has done it again!  Another great book about Greg I literally finished It the other day and thought it was as great as all the others.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Fast talking, always on the move, Cumberbatch's Sherlock is irresistible. Martin Freeman's Dr. Watson is the perfect low-key foil for the high-powered detective. There are only six episodes to enjoy so watch them sparingly.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a remarkable book that I couldn't put down. It was funny, romantic and touching al at the same time. While I didn't want it to end, I couldn't wait to finish it. A definite must read for everyone!
0321885112|5.0|Mike's statements about taking notes and never reading them again hit home and I wanted to find a way to capture notes and actually get use out of them after the meeting or conference. I purchased the book and was very pleased to see Mike address my concern of not being an artist by providing some extremely valuable guidance on how to sketch with simple shapes (chapter near the end of the book). I love that the book is in sketchnote form itself and find this format to be quite helpful.<br /><br />I only read books in electronic format, but figured this one would be best to get in paper form so I could have it next to my Moleskine, drop it on the coffee table to pick up and review, and also share with my family. This really isn't a book that I think works well as an ebook so I recommend you pick up the paper copy. Plus, the paper copy feels fantastic and is unique in its design.<br /><br />I have a daughter now in college and one about ready to finish high school and am letting them use the book after I finish in hopes that they can apply it to lectures and other courses to capture more useful notes and help retain more of what they are learning. Mike focuses on conferences, but I think there are also many other venues to use sketchnoting and would love to hear more about when people use this technique.<br /><br />It seems that everything is moving to electronic form today, but it really does feel good to put pen to paper once in a while and I would like to see more people applying the sketchnote method.
1551111268|5.0|The book's condition was even better than I expected.  My granddaughter was very pleased.  Couldn't be happier with the purchase.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I've read this many times and will read it many times more awesome combination of myth and reality loved it
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is an awesome story of who we are. Anita is blessed to experience life a second time without the fear that has crippled her in her first life. She shares so much insight with us on her return. How to live but most importantly how important LOVE is. Love of ourself first of all and then love of all, since we are truly all one and connected. Beautiful story, I will read this again and again.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|i thought it was good but needs less time for the wait of them being born so i give it a 8.5
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I am in love with Rod's voice, Merry Christmas, Baby it's a great, simple and romantic tittle, and, his Christmas music is what I was missing in my Rod Stewart's personal collection. I'll say it again, perfect!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|it is a good way to keep track of your daily life to keep notes and can even use audio to record your thoughts on the go. Evernote syncs with al devices and PC so it is very helpful
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is one of my favorites.Great for eye and hand contact.Challenging, a great way to exercise the mind.I would recommend this version to my friends.
B0043CSBKM|1.0|this is really disappointing they did not specify that u could not play this disc on us blu ray players so i spent this money on a useless dvd and cant return it bc i opened it. if thats so they should have warned buyers so im really upset with product.i would rate this a -100 they should specify. rarewaves is who i purchased the movie from and would not recomend getn anything from them.<br />  sincerely pissed off customer
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I have this book a five star because it goes along with all the other diary of a wimpy kids.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was looking for a new book to read when i came across \\"Hopeless\\" I read some of the reviews for the book and decided to give it a try. And wow I am just blown away at how raw this book is. By far it is one of the best young adult books I have read in a long time. This books touches on sensitive topics such as abuse. I don't want to give too much away but this book is a must read. I literally read the book in two days that's how enthralling this book is. If you are looking for a good read that has engaging characters then this book is a must read
B007TNS6JI|4.0|It's a good game but I think it would be better with lower equipment prices other then that's it's a good game
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I love hidden object games and this one had good graphics and puzzles that were solvable. There is zoom and I was able to save the game and return later with no problems. The previous problems mentioned by some reviewers seems to have been fixed. No problems on my kindle fire. Enjoyable to play and would recommend. I will look for other games by Nevosoft.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK!!! Couldn't stop reading it. Defiantly recommend this book to young teens like me because it's not your typical love story.
B002ZG999U|4.0|I viewed both parts 1 & 2 and both played very well, Thank you so much for the wonderful DVD's
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the first book,an  have  been in love ever since. Actually...it's more of an unhealthy obsession... but I think this is the perfect ending to an amazing trilogy. I never  could have  live  without such a happy ending:)
B009MF5BXK|4.0|The movie played really well and I enjoyed both parts of this DVD as dI bought both parts 1 & 2.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is one of the best heartfelt books I have ever read. It truly touched my heart and I felt so connected to the characters. I would recommend this book to everyone!
B0053O89IS|4.0|I have not viewed this dvd yet but do intend to do so in the future, it appeared to be in great condition.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Great read for anyone who loves a mystery with subtle romance. Really invigorates your mind by making you second guess your self. The novel is compelling and makes you fall in love with the characters.
0345803485|5.0|Keeps you reading!!  Didn't think that I would like this, but I couldn't put it down.  It's entertaining and you can relate to the underdog(being Anna) and her dysfunctional man.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my kids &amp; I are having a blast playing this! def grateful for having it in the waiting room @ dr's offices! just challenging enough for them.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I've had this app on my iPhones and iPad for a while and now that it's on my Kindle Fire it's the only radio app I ever use  and does everything .
B009HEMK7Q|4.0|In general, it was good. Some parts of the story were over done. If I say any more, I'll give away too much of the story.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|We enjoyed this movie, a keeper.  True-to-life feel good movie with Clint playing a really authentic old man... O Yeah, he is an old man.  Movie had some genuine moments such as the value of life wisdom trumping computer science which left a nice aftertaste..  Skinny dipping scene was a surprise, actually left their real people underwear and shirt on....not sure why that was more fun than the usual Hollywood interpretation, but it was.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book starts well and the premise of the book is good, but it lacks the intensity at the end. Didnt feel that the book ends well.
B00A7Z8KAU|1.0|Like another user said, the amazon app store wouldn't let me download Pro for my android tablet(saying it was incompatible) so I gave up and bought it from Google Play instead.  Exactly the same program for the same price, and I had it up and running in less than five minutes (with time to return it if I wished!).  Runs perfectly, no lag at all, no saving issues etc.  Don't know what the deal is with the amazon version but I'd definitely look somewhere else.
B007HGPBRC|2.0|The chapters that he's completed are a compelling read, but I felt cheated since there is not much in the book. Seems like the publishers set out to make a quick buck from his untimely death
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  I really enjoy the ability to subscribe to a season via my Prime membership.  I watch the show, but then I can watch it again without commercials any time.  Fabulous!
B00948EPOQ|3.0|I had not seen a Woody Allen film in years. Thought I would give it a try. Same old Woody.
B000059T00|5.0|To me this is the last really great album by Eric and Ginger Baker, Steve Winwood and bassist Rick Grech are no slouces either. Best songs are Had To Cry Today, Can't Find My Way Home, Presence Of The Lord, and Well All Right, the Buddy Holly cover they did, which Santana later covered as well.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A cleverly written story with imaginative characters and puzzles on which to contemplate.  Also some cleverly worded ideas which resonated with the readers who took time to highlight them. A very enjoyable read.
B005LAIHE0|3.0|It was your typical dramatic comedy. It was kind of long. Had some very funny lines. For the price it's not a bad buy.
1612680011|5.0|This should be on every childs &#34;must read&#34; list.<br />Some books give more insight than years of school.<br />I gave it to two relatives (14 -17 years old) catch them<br />while they are still young!
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I enjoy every one of the characters on this show.<br />They are all smart and funny. Bring on season six!!
B007N579X6|5.0|Liked this film at the theater and when I bought a 3D TV I wanted to see if the Television and the film were up to par on it.  Well, I must say, the Vizio 55&#34; 3D Smart TV and this film work together well.  GREAT picture, NICE 3D; better than the theater in my opinion!  The passive 3D system of the Vizio means you don't have heavy glasses to wear and the 3D effects are all there.<br /><br />The film?  Great storyline.  If you haven't seen it, read the reviews, read the plot, and if it seems like something you would like, order it.  Some of the lines we regularly use around our house come from this film.  Makes for good comedic moments at times.  Two thumbs up!
B00AH8U3UC|5.0|This show just gets raunchier and raunchier, and I love it!!<br />Makes me wonder how much is based on real situations or<br />if it's pure fiction!!  If this is what life is like in L.A.... Wow!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love angry birds and star wars now that they are combined I get the best of both worlds awesome!!!
B008JB4XX2|5.0|This is the best rock album I have heard in quite a while. These guys are my new favorite, and that is saying alot.
B0089XH38M|5.0|Best app to have on your phone.  If not for the antivirus for the addition feature.  I love the option to find my phone.
B00846F1YW|2.0|on level 7 'find all business cards' - a card is covered by the menu at the top so you cant see the card. therefore you can't advance to the next level
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Epic Stickman is by far the best app ive downloaded for my kindle fire. It works great and is even good for little ones
B0079R8IYW|5.0|This case helps to protect the Kindle Fire when it falls on the ground.  My 13 months old loves to pull things and drops them so this case has been quite helpful.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Lots of fun but like most Facebook style games they expect you to play forever or pay real money to get the good stuff.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I have this on my IPhone and it works great,easy to use. I also have Amazon price checker on phone the two go great together. Check price in store if cheaper just order from where you are. I was Christmas shopping and my Father wanted an old movie he did not tell me till I was in best buy. Just pulled it up on app and it arrived 3days later.
B006H5120E|5.0|best  love story movie  i have ever  watch in three D. i love it , i probably it over and ever again

B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love these kind of games. This one is well worth the money. You have puzzles and objects to find. The hints are goodalso if you need them.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|The 5th DVD skips and even hits a point where it stops completely. The other movies however play just fine.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love the way on the location screen it shows a summery of all the places I keep track of the weather (Where my kids live)'.It's all right there. As long as you have internet service this works great.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|This is one of our families favorites. We went to see this is theaters. A must have for ever family. Beautifully done. .
B008H5J510|5.0|It was a gift for my boyfriend I was not the biggest fan of Katy Perry then I watched the movie and.now I love her toototally recommend it for others.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I like this case because you can stand it up and watch a movie on it. Holding it my hands get tierd.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This book is an enjoyable read.  It touches on the essence of life and the cornerstones of living:  growing, loving, tragedy, and redemption.  It is a heart warming story with some unexpected twists.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the one app I have to have on all my devices. No more scrambling for sheets of paper or trying to remember in which notebook or sheet of paper I wrote a particular note. Highly recommend this app!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Nice story line. kept my interest. Did need to travel back and forth a lot to get the job done. Some of the hidden objects were too dark to see. Overall enjoyed the game.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Compelling.  Simply could not stop watching it.  TV at its finest, episode after episode.  Would have made for an outstanding feature length film.
B002ZG980U|4.0|I thought I found this for a great Cyber Monday price at $7 for the dvd, but my sis-in-law found the same dvd in a store on sale that day for $5.  At $7, it still was a good buy.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Absolutely extraordinary story.  I can see how difficult it would be to translate this story into a movie.  Wanted to read the novel before viewing the movie
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I wasn't expecting much out of this game when I downloaded it but I have to say it is addicting. So much so that I bought the full version. I never pay for apps, which says something.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun and it keeps you busy for a while. really nice that they continue adding games. recommend to anyone
0061992860|5.0|This is a small pocket guide but don't let its size give you the wrong impression as there is a lot of good knowledge here.  The survival techniques for navigating locating safe food and shelter building all provide a foundation of knowledge that cansave your life in an unexpected situation.  Buy a copy and take it with you whenever possible it could save your life.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|One of my favorite games for the kindle. I love strategy games. I also like the feature of mulyiple players besides just playing the computer.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm 13, fell in love with this book, just had to have it, sure do love my DADDY for it!
B002VECM6S|5.0|My grandson and I watched this.  He did not think he was gonna like it, but wanted to watch it again the next day.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I stumbled across this title while looking through the library website. I chose it because of its odd name, and I can say that this is one of my new favorites!!!!
B005XLN97M|5.0|Purchased this dollhouse for $20 on a different site, I was so excited for my 9 year old to see it, she has always wanted a dollhouse and this year was the year I was able to afford one. Well she loved it and she built it all by herself! it took her around 20 minutes or so. Its a good size, I bought her bratz and winx dolls and they all fit perfectly in there. I like how it has many accessories to pretend, it even has a blanket for the bed, so cute!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Fun, easy to play. Have not had any issues yet but have only played for a few weeks. Would recomend to anyone who likes pioneer trail and games like that.
B004SIP8QQ|4.0|I had to purchase this movie because it adds to the collection of QT films that i already own in my dvd rack. The product came in early as well so thats always a plus.
0143039881|4.0|This is the second time that Ihave read this work and I believe that everyone should read it. Pat Dingle
B00008EYA5|2.0|Finally saw this. I like action movies, but this one didn't have enough going for it to make it worth watching again, let alone earning. Some good actors here, but ultimately, the random pacing and poor plot build up just killed it. And for action, these are unforgivable misses. The pacing was slowed down by attempts at character building that had nothing at all to do with the plot, and when the betrayal happened I couldn't help but feel that it came out of nowhere. The escape of the bad guy was too well orchestrated with no basis at all. Where did those resources come from? The people? What brought them together? Money? I certainly watched it to the end, but now that I've seen this, I couldn't recommend anything about it.
B008MA83HC|5.0|Two CDs, but only the second one has the real hits, many af them real classics. Overall, a good purchase.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I never knew how the money worked behind the scenes in baseball. Boy!  This movie was sure an eye-opener!!  Received in great shape and quickly.
1594484805|4.0|I liked the book. It has implications for education. It is no all about punitive discipline/rewards; carrots and sticks but about intrinsic motivation. I wish more people will read it and act on it!
B005VPRET4|5.0|I purchased this set for my preschool class. I am introducing a Lego Education Unit to my class and wanted to really get the girls interested in building. I built it first for they to explore and then will help they build it again. The figures are very cute and appealing to young girls to use their imaginations and try building.
B003BYYDXW|5.0|We enjoyed the convenience of downloading this to the Amazon cloud player and then streaming it onto my daughters tablet.
B00011ZBXO|5.0|great film for those who love club kids and fabulousness! Mr Culkin is so great as Michael Alig and Seth Green is absolutely on spot when it comes to portraying James St James. Hands down one of my favorite films of all time!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter loves to play this game.  It challenges her brain and keeps her thinking.  Love it, can't exercise the brain too much!
B00005LC4B|4.0|Great film...the cast is definately #1.  And Mr Robert De Niro is extremely captivating.  super creepy and keeps you interested the whole time!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I loved the Walking Dead as soon as I saw the first episode, but it just keeps getting better and better as it goes along.  I have seen where people criticize the show for being slow-paced or not gory enough, but I think it is a wonderful portrayal of the human drama behind a zombie apocalypse.  When the action does come, its well-paced, and exciting without being over-blown.<br /><br />Season 2 portrays the Atlanta survivors coming upon Herschel Walker's farm, and struggling to deal with issues both inside thegroup, and with Herschel and his people.  The first 7 episodes build toward the heart-wrenching mid-season finale.  The second half of season 2 picks up with the group undergoing drastic changes that set up the fantastic season 3.  Can't wait for February when it returns to AMC!<br /><br />Aside from the show itself, this Blu-Ray collection is a good buy for fans of the show, and anyone wanting to get up to speed with the series
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to watch this movie! Loved the story and the characters! Augustus Macrae was quite the guy!
B005AUWXZ0|2.0|Firstly, the word \\"kill\\" is used a LOT in this movie! And trust me, it gets repeated! I realize that it's a spy movie, but they could say \\"get rid of him!\\" or \\"take care of him!\\" instead of \\"kill him!\\"<br /><br />and on top of that, it get's repeated at school! \\"Im going to kill you emily!\\" really, pixar, really??<br />My children finally quit saying it (they are 3 to 5) and now that isn't as much an issue...<br /><br />other than that I don't think the story is nearly as cute or amusing as it was in the first movie. This one seems far \\"darker\\" and even more on the level of older children. Mine didn't really know what was going on most of the time they were just like WOO Lightening McQueen! (when he did occasionally show up)<br /><br />as far as my kids are concerned, they like the movie. As a parent, It isn't my favorite and it gets pushed to the back of the movie shelf.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love Nathan Fillion. Started watching this show because of Firefly, and quickly fell in love with it. The Characters are fantastic, including the supporting roles. Definitely worth a watch, even got my parents hooked on it!

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I purchased after I showed it to a high school science class.  They were all attentive to it.  While educational it is also something that kept their attention.  I was impressed that after showing it all day it was still an interesting watch for myself.
B0058VW36U|4.0|We are enjoying all the different levels that came with this version. Would definately buy it again after playing it.
B004QL7K70|5.0|I definitely think this movie is funny. It shipped on time and I'm watching it now . I recommend this movie for anyone looking to laugh.

006197806X|4.0|*Spoilers for Delirium*  It's been more than a year since I read the first installment in this trilogy, Delirium, so I might not be in the best place to compare Pandemonium seeing as how my memories of the first are so fuzzy, but I feel pretty confident in saying that this is not only a good sequel, but a sequel that has improved upon the flaws of it's predecessor.    Now, since my computer has an infuriating virus, I need to write this review quickly, so I'll try to keep it pretty straightforward.    My feelings for the first were overall pretty positive. I liked Lauren Oliver's writing, I didn't think the romance was s***, after the first 100 pages I couldn't put it down, the characters were enjoyable enough for me to read about, but the world-building was garbage, plain and simple.    So, the world-building does improve a little bit, but not a whole lot, so if that is going to damage your reading experience of this tremendously, I wouldn't reccomend reading this. We do get a better look at how other areas of this world operate, but not so much that I could visualize this actually happening.    However, I guess that's why it's one of my guilty pleasure series (kind of like The Chemical Garden Trilogy by Lauren DeStefano). I know that it's not exactly great literature, and won't impact the way how I view the world or society as a whole, but reading it is pleasurable, and it's a story that I can invest myself in for the time I'm in it.    Lena has grown a large amount since the ending of the first book. She's not afraid to get down and dirty, and she isn't afraid to pull some punches in this book. She is still depressed over what happened at the end of the first book, where her little hope of having a happily ever after with Alex was obliterated, but it's not a depression that bogs down the book.    Seeing her pull this inner strength from within was amazing to read about, to be able to compare the Lena I was seeing now to the Lena from my memories. They're almost two completely different people, and I do think that Lauren Oliver did this intentionally when she wrote these books.    What I love about Lena is how strong she's become. No, it's not just how she can now punch somebody with ease, or that she can fight. It's because she survives emotional and physical trauma, and she finds it within herself to heal and get back up on her feet.    And then kick butt.    Julian is interesting. I don't think he's an amazing character, but I kind of like him, and his relationship with Lena seemed to progress rather naturally. It definitely wasn't insta-love, and perhaps it does progress maybe a little on the fast side, but not unrealistically so.    Also, those who were weary of the romance-heavy hand of Delirium need not worry when it comes to this book. Romance is definitely put on the backburner compared to the amount of action in this book. I know that sounds weird when the first book was esentially a romance, but this book really is more like an action book.    We have Lena constantly having to fight for her survival against the government, nature, and even the Invalids that she has joined. I do hope that this more action oriented angle does continue into the last book, since I was pleasantly surprised at Lauren Oliver writing an action scene at all, after having convinced myself that I would never see her write one.    Pacing is a large step-up. There is very little down-time, mainly because of how non-linear this book is. We're constantly flipping between the present and the time immediately following Lena's separation from Alex. This almost always promised one of the storylines to have action or some kind of element of the fast-paced variety.    I won't rave about Lauren Oliver's prose more than I have to. I'm just going to say it's beautiful.    The only negative aside from the lackluster world-building is the cliffhanger. It was obvious, but still a really cheap shot.    Even if it was obvious when the first book ended.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Its the movie expected. Was a great one, but slow moving at times.<br />A lot of great actors in these also. Don't miss it if you have watched<br />earlier ones.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love playing bingo and this one is very enjoyable because it moves along quite fast!  My only complaint is that you have to use &#34;tokens&#34; to buy your cards and if you run out...you don't play!
0761169431|4.0|This book is good, I think the whole family is going to learn origami. My son got this for Christ but I think we are going to have to learn as parents and then teach him how to do it. There is two pieces of paper with the color or drawings on them. Plus we can practice with other paper before we use the nice paper.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my kids love playing.. so do I.. no glitches.. very smooth.. you will love it too.. you should try it..
B008UTV6S8|5.0|She loved them back from the days in the 60s.  She claims that it is a good album.  She's been an avid follower over the years.  For me, I still think the Concert in Central Park was the best one.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I liked the book, but wouldn't consider re-reading it, it was pretty well thought out but not really my style and I much preferred the movie.
B00867GHS8|5.0|By far the best visually 3D bluray movie I own. I have active 3d glasses and some times eyes get tired, not with this movie.

B0039Q7QKE|5.0|I ordered all 4 of these metal Star Trek pins (one for each division of Starfleet).  The Command Insignia came yesterday, and I absolutely love it. i've heard that these are &#34;exact replicas&#34; of the pins used in the 2009 movie, and it is so true!  I like the brushed metal look.  Plus, the box it comes in is usful for displying it when its not on your uniform.  I highly recommend these pins to any Trekkie/Trekker/Whatever you call a Star Trek fan!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|This game works for a while and then when you try to write something on a sign it won't work most of the time play it for umm a month or so and things will definitely go wrong or at least for the kindle fire it will!  :(

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Pretty amazing. And a lot better than the movie made it out to be. Loved it more than a few I've read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|VERY suspenseful and better than the first one! E.L. James does a better job in her writing this time. It is worth a read!

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Andy Weir's The Martian starts the action in the first few minutes of your read and doesn't let you go until he's done with you.  If MacGyver found himself in similar survival situations, he'd have a tough time keeping up with Mark Watney.  Overall, a very enjoyable read and worth many times the Kindle price for this book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is fantastic. I use this alarm clock daily and I love it! The features are awesome and I love that I can pick my own sound as well!

B001NHNG64|5.0|This book is very good with a very good plot to figure out. Lee Childs does a great job and I like the fact that there is only the imagination of the sex and not full on description which does not have to be in books! Ya don't have to skip, yah!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|love the last performance! I wish there were more performances in the movie. Though it was not as funny as I expected It to be.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|NOTE: I was able to compare this fake case to my REAL Iphone 5 lifeproof case from Best Buy........ I Was excited to receive this case as it was a christmas present for my girlfriend... opened it up and a piece inside that is supposed to help switch vibrate/sound on and off fell out of the case.... not to mention the film over the screen was really loose. Will be sending back. Don't waste your money!!!!!
B009VB7QQA|2.0|A shame. This could have been a good premise for a movie.It looked like a medium budget made-for-TV movie. Most TV episodes of &#34;Grimm&#34; were better made and written...

B0086700CM|4.0|My grand kids wanted this game for their kindle fires and then played it constantly for about 3 or 4 days. I started playing it and it is fun for a while. It does get kinda old after a while, but we like to see who can get the high score out of 3 game matches.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|As soon as I heard this album was available for download, I couldn't relax until I had listened to it. Overall, I was not disappointed. Although I do wish some personal favorites like \\"Lovely Ladies,\\" \\"Fantine's Death,\\" and \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\" had been included, I am not going to complain about the selection of songs.<br />Now comes the singing. I'll divide it up by actor so as not to generalize.<br />Hugh Jackman (Jean Valjean) : I was impressed with him in the beginning, but did not like his rendition of \\"Bring Him Home\\" until listening to it a dozen times. Jackman does have a background in theater and it shows through. He can hit some high notes, and his acting completes the package.<br />Russell Crowe (Javert) : I was not impressed with him at all. He sounded terrible in my opinion. Not off-key per se, but he just does not have a good singing voice. Although, I did think his version of \\"Stars\\" was good.<br />Anne Hathaway (Fantine) : I'd heard Anne sing live before and thought she was all right, but she blew me away wit her performance. Her \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" absolutely broke my heart. She may not be the perfect singer, but she's good enough and her acting is spot-on.<br />Eddie Redmayne (Marius) : I wasn't expecting much from him, but he did a good job. I still like Nick Jonas better, but he was not bad by any means.<br />Amanda Seyfried (Cosette) : Anyone who's seen \\"Mamma Mia!\\" or \\"Dear John\\" knows that Amanda can sing, but there's singing and then there's singing and hitting soprano notes...it's true that Amanda has a unique vibrato, but I don't think it took away from her perfomance. I loved her portrayal of the charcter and wish that she had more songs to sing.<br />Samantha Barks (Eponine) : We all know this girl can sing, but she was even better than I remembered. Her version of \\"On My Own\\" had me in tears, which no other version has managed to do. Samantha Barks is by far the best singer of the cast.<br />Helena Bonham Carter (Mme. Thenardier) : I liked her in \\"Sweeney Todd,\\" and liked her even better in this. She really does have a nice voice and I really couldn't have imagined anyone else playing the role the way she did.<br />Sacha Baron Cohen (M. Thenardier) : He can sing, let's face it. He did a good job. My only complaint is the cheesy fake French accent he randomly adopts for a verse of \\"Master of the House.\\"<br />Aaron Tveit (Enjolras): He was really good. I was upset that Ramin Karimloo wasn't cast as Enjolras, but Aaron can sing his ass off. He's my new second favoite Enjolras.<br />Isabelle Allen (Young Cosette) :  She is my personal favorite Young Cosette. She brings such sweetness and innocence to the role. It's heartbreaking to see her mistreatment at the hands of the Thenardiers.<br /> Daniel Huttlestone (Gavroche): He has a good voice, not the strongest ,but good nonetheless.<br />Overall, I was pleased with the recording (all live, by the way, no auto-tune) and look forward to (hopefully!) a complete recording.liked her in \\"Sweeney Todd,\\" and liked her even better in this. She really does have a nice voice and I really couldn't have imagined anyone else playing the role the way she did.<br />Sacha Baron Cohen (M. Thenardier) : He can sing, let's face it.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have been playing this game for just a few days but am really enjoying it. I have nothing bad to say about it but would caution anyone who has no patience to think before getting it as it does require time for the dragons to breed and hatch, etc. I don't think it's fair of people to rate a great game down simply because they were impatient.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I am not able to sign on from different devices.  This software does not recognize me from my iphone or laptop.  A friend of mine affirms the same problem.  Needs to recognize the user, not the device.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded this game originally for my 8 year old who loved it at first but now plays with all the other apps i have instead. I am the primary player now and it is fun to build up ponyville and go through the story line but the game is very glitchy. I cant visit friends locations I can only send them gifts. The cost of getting a new pony using gems of heart gems is insanely too high, even after they lowered them. I maxed out the levels already and now almost everything cost real money to continue the story line and not just a couple bucks but a lot of money so it takes the fun out of it. Overall its ok for occasional playing but not for avid game players.  **Update** I had to download an update to the game which deleted all of my saved game data including what I spent real money on with no way to get it back. I stopped playing after that.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is unbelievably addicting. Very simple concept, yet hours of pure entertainment. I can finally give Angry Birds a rest for a while.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like angry birds, but I keep getting ads that flash into the game while I am playing.  its rather annoying, and I will be deleting this game and getting the other one.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best book so far. So unexpected, so interested, it had me on the edge of my seat page after page.I told myself to stop after a page but I just couldn't. Amazing, just amazing.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|fits good, and the stand works perfectly would buy again. overall i would give it a 4 star. thanks again
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I just wish that there was a way for it to move automatically. having to keep in contact with the screen limits its fun slightly.
1400067820|5.0|It's a very insightful book by Taleb.<br /><br />I've read the Black Swan and Fooled by Randonness. I like the aggressive writing style of Taleb and I agree with the main statements of him. You can either like these ideas very much or despise them very much, but, in any case, you will think from other point of view. Really a \\"barbell\\" strategy.
0060589469|1.0|i would not recommend anyone to read this book based on the following quote in it. \\"When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called a Religion.\\" with this one statement, he relegates whatever religion anyone has to the waste bin. to give any time to a person with such a disrespect to what to a lot of people is the most important thing in their lives makes no sense. yes, those of a certain religion will say that another religion is wrong, and this is how it should be; otherwise all religions are the same, which is not true. However, despite this disagreement between differing religions, the author's statement is blasphemous toward them all. it's supposed to be a smart, pithy, humorous comment, designed to make people think, by using some shock. all it is is a disrespect to the general populace, a lack of gratitude for the good things that religion does bring, and a demonization of the most profound subject matter of the great majority of sentient beings.
B000AP04MO|5.0|&#34;Two for the Road&#34; is one of my all-time favorite movies with two of my favorite actors, and now I can watch it whenever I want!
B002NZK5QY|1.0|This disc was flawed.  It only played the music track on 3 different CD players and no voice.  Returned the disc and its replacement had  the same problem!!  The disc also had the 2ed half on the flip side rather than a 2 disc set.  This must have been from a knock off company. Beware!

B009A882D0|5.0|My best friend's soninlaw specifically asked for this new CD set.  After Xmas , he thanked me for finding it ..he couldn't ... and said it was &#34;incredible&#34;.  As an ole Creedence  girl myself,  I found an old LP hoping to revive my Creedence feeling.  Not able to hear old recordings.  No problem; the new set has more and better sounds assembled.  Thank you amazon for your excellent price and delivery of the latest addition to our music book of life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got an amazon gift card for Christmas this year, so I thought... and thought... and thought... and then it HIT ME! It needs more updates, but still a really awesome app. Highly recommend. I'm just glad I technically got it for free. (gift card)
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The in the beginning started very slow, to the point where I left it for about a week and half.  It kinda drags when it starts to tie everything together it gets alright.  The back and forth on planes etc it seemed blah.  I could not get into it but I finished it. I'm taking a break from JG books they are getting lil boring.
B001992NUQ|5.0|This BR comming with a nice cover.<br />I would like more is we can find more info about the pre-production, production and post-production.<br />But, this movie is one of my favorites, so i enjoy it so much :D

B009MCRHH6|5.0|I absolutely love this game I am sooooo addicted I have been playing for hours (sad to say). This game has you building things with little round gobs of goo like towers and bridges to get you to the next level and if you have extra they put them in a different world haven't figured out what that is for yet. If they make another I would definitely pay for it.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This show is very funny and has a great message about a change of heart when a person opens their heart to others.

B005TBWN0K|4.0|This is the perfect tool to quickly create a simple sketch and is much more user friendly than other tools.  Love the way it integrates with Evernote.  It is just annoying because it doesn't have an eraser tool.  You have to delete an entire line segment in order to remove it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this game downloaded on my kindle fire original and now on my kindle fire HD and I've never had any problems with ads popping up randomly or any freezing. This is a fantastic version of solitaire nice design, easy to use, and really one of the few apps I keep using over and over.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|When I installed this app I was shocked at how much functionality it has and how well it works.  Very thankful for it and have used it a lot.

B009VB998I|5.0|I watched this on my new Kindle fire HD and it was amazing!  A very good family film.  I would recommend it!
B005OHSD3A|4.0|After getting the book and reading it, I decided the diet was way too restrictive to work for any length of time.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I was surprised by how much we enjoyed this movie.  Glad I rented it.  And easier yet, rented it from Amazon.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids loved this movie they called it the motorcycle movie, they love watching it in the car and its so cute
B007PKDW44|5.0|I'd just found out about Volbeat after their huge hit, the Warrior's Call and I've fallen in love with this cd. The music is so upbeat and catchy I love it! There isn't a bad song on the cd, three of them have already become radio hits. I ordered all their other cds after I listened to this one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't think it could get much steamer after the 1st one but I have been proven wrong. Wow, Mommy porn! :)
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I got this kindle mainly for games and facebook so I don't have to stare at a small screen. I find it very awkward that Amazon has not let customers know that facebook App does not work with the majority of the kindle, upon purchase. I will be returning my kindle and going with a different tablet. This has been going on for several months now and Kindle still advertises facebook for kindle. I feel misled...very disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can I say? If there was a 50 shades 4, 5, 6, ext I'd read those too! I hear there could be a move.. What would that be rated?
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This might not be an Austen classic, but it was a good story that I enjoyed reading. It was light-hearted and easy to read, and by I was always intrigued to keep reading to see how it ended.
1556438850|5.0|This book is to the point, and offers great advice, especially the verbal cues. It is a must have for every teacher.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is loads of fun for the whole family!  My dad got me started and now my husband, son, and I all enjoy playing it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|An easy read with great characters that win you over. The misfit that manages to fit in and find himself.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|Got this for the free app of the day.  Really a cool little game.  Play it on my kindle fire hd.  Also on a kindle fire.  Easy to understand the rules.  Quite simple actually.  Its hard for me to find games that are challenging and likeable but this one passes both criteria.  My 11 yr old likes it too.  And no ads so far and I'm on level 10.  No pop-ups to buy anything additional yet either.
0307592731|5.0|I thought this would be another &#34;lost young yuppie finds peace - big deal...&#34; and was very pleasantly surprised by its tone and depth.  The author's voice is clear and free of self-pity.  I'm no hiker but was with her all the way.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The protection quality of this product is fair to good but the only set back is the  actual ability to stand.  It fails in this area.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What I loved the most about this book was John Green's unique take on two teenagers meeting and dealing with  having cancer. However, cancer is not the focus. It's their relationship, their acceptance of each other, and their dealing with living life. I could not put it down.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Love this book, can't wait to read the last one of the series.  Very interesting keeps you hanging on until the end.
B000C13Y2S|4.0|i got less that 3 day it really cool but it doesnt have a glass or plastic cover on the flash light where it cover the led and the legs are different more plastic it feel like it can brake easy but it a key chain they break really easy will like if the inventor of this flash light put magnet on the legs so it can stick on to mettle so when im working on my car i can just stick on somewhere to use.
B0007TKH66|1.0|My item was sent very quickly! But i ordered season 1 i was sent season 2 very un satisfied at this point 2 does no go without 1
B000Q67876|5.0|i bought this movie because it had alot of good reviews do not regreat buying it was a really good movie really recomend this movie
B0045HCJ94|5.0|This is a quaiity production and I found it to be both powerful and gripping.  Elizabeth Taylor deserved the Oscar for her performance.  Richard Burton should have received one as well.  I've watched this movie twice now and will probably watch it again sometime in the furture.  The art of story telling just isn't the same with today's movies.
B007STBUIW|5.0|It would rate 5 stars , even if it was a new release today, great acting, action , special effects and directing
B005OCFGTO|5.0|What can I say...the DVDs are as they should be. Don't have Blu ray(and don't need it) sothey are the standard version nd play just fine.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is amazingly amazing and its one of my favorite books of all time. I looooooooooooooove it to death
B004NSURT4|2.0|I brought this novel having not read a spy novel before. But the le Carre books have always caught my eye with their mystique and the acclaim that its garnished from reviewers. I was pretty dissapointed. le Carre is certainly a gifted writer and the style of his writing leads to a shrouded, gritty urban atmosphere that lends well to a spy novel. However, the plot was pretty mundane and by halfway through the book it was becoming a real labour to finish and I was well past the point of caring about the outcome. For anyone who is a keen reader of espionage fiction this is probably the book for them. For myself, a novice in the world of spy fiction, I found it mundane and ultimately forgettable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I played it and I loved it I'm awesome at creative but not as good as survival my best world is the world with all gold swords and NO house!!!<br />U WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!!:)
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|a lot of fun and hours of entertainment kid love to play it as well and keeps them entertained for hours
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I stayed up two nights reading it just like the first time I read it. Suzanne Collins made some kind of magic here.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was an amazing book I would recommend this to anybody that likes adventure and secrets cuz this book has or of them!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|This game is alright but some levels you have to pay. Plus when it first came out it was 2.99 so it was kind of a waste. Buy it now if you want it before the price goes back up.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I think it's kind of hard because on level two, it gets hard, and get mad cause first I make it but then I mess up!!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Great movie with great music. Definitely a must see for anyone who likes fun rock musicals or just classic rock in general.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is the cutest game!!!! I played on my friend' s kindle but later when I got my kindle this was the first thing I got
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I can't get this game to load on my Kindle Fire, it says it is for the Fire but won't work on mine.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book and I could not stop reading it. I am ready fir the next one because it was so amazing
1878424319|5.0|This book changed my life. I think differently now by that, I mean positively. I bought this book for four of my friends and will keep buying for those I love. The book has also changed their perspectives about life. I'm a simple being now. I am now aware of my purpose in life. This days, I want to give love not caring if I get some back cos that's what makes me happy. A must read for matured minds. Enjoy!
B003EV6DBW|5.0|Bought 3 during a markdown for presents. I suppose this should rate the packaging; which is fine!<br />Can't help myself and rate the show. Stories and just as important, the music is superb.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game and so do my children. There were a few bugs but an update fixed them
B0081SPK0I|1.0|This is a good game when it runs, but about half the time when I try to start this game it causes my Kindle Fire to freeze up, requiring me to do a cold restart.  If it didn't do this sort of thing I'd rate it at least 4 stars, it's a fun racing game when I can get it to run.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|They did a great job bringing all of the character story lines together. I enjoyed it from beginning to end.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This product was exactly like stated online- fits the kindle fire perfectly - a very nice addition to the kindle fire.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is great for middle school kids I am a huge fan of Jeff Kinney he is a great author
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones were perfect: Meryl plays a sweet, dominated housewife who yearns for the marriage she used to have. Tommy Lee Jones over the years has settled into sleeping in his own room, virtually ignoring his wife. He appears to not have any romance left in him. A week of intensive therapy that Tommy Lee Jones resists has an amazing effect on his marriage.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie although I thought it was suppose to be a complete comedy. Actually was very serious. Did not take away from the fact that it was great. Really liked all actors. My favorites.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Clint Eastwood played the role he always played and this was appropriate for this film. Amy Adams very good in the role. The story of an old-timer baseball scout with special skills competing successfully with the new computer-reliant scout was enjoyable for me. Humans vanquishes the computer!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  My only non-positive is that I like books that begin and end in the same book.  This book is part of a series that is not self-contained in one book, but rather keeps going on and on into another book, basically holding the reader hostage.  I don't care for that style of book series writing.  It could still be a series but end one story line in each book.  Just my thoughts on the matter.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Though I did enjoy this book and the characters I believe I was expecting a little more from it. But that's probably because I had just read fifty shades and it was along the same lines but much more discreet  I will be purchasing the second one though it was good enough
B005DOL0R0|3.0|Was very disappointed that I could not read in rhe sunlight!  Other models like the nook appear fine in the light.  Wish I would have known this before I purchased it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is spider solitaire. It does that. There are annoying ads, but I'm too cheap to buy the full version.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is a game that goes beyond just using repetitive actions to progress and beat the game. There are hours and hours worth of entertainment provided via puzzles that get you to worry about structural integrity and timing.
0446554995|5.0|I am a Preston and Child fan, and this book is excellent. Penderghast is at his strangest and coolest, and the story is interesting. Five stars for Two Graves. kkp
1599290642|5.0|Spectrum has been showcasing fantasy art in the contemporary marketplace and unpublished work by artists for nineteen years. The book is a juried publication, so there is jury that determines the flavor and over look of the included work.  The range is spectacular: painting, drawing, 3-D work, concept art, editorial, and sequential art. Every year it has grown and become an amazing collection of talent.  As a teacher, it was a must in my classroom, not only to show the range of subject matter but also the range of styles and techniques used. As an Fantasy Artist, It is a honor to be included with such a group of talented artists. I can only say that Kathy and Arnie Fenner with Tim Underwood have done a superb job in keeping this high quality publication in production for 19 years.  I also go back and look at the earlier books all the time, it is a wonderful journey down the history of fantasy art over this span of time.  Please check out the other Fenner/Underwood books, they a wonderful range of artists and content. I must say the Virgil Finlay books are wonderful, along with Frazetta, Jones and others.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book held my attention until the last page!<br />Recommend to anyone who has read the first Hunger Games books or seen the movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is easy to use and fun. I only I do not like is the ads that pop up every time you start a new game, but you just have to hit skip this ad and move on
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Works great. Easy to attach kindle to and is very durable. Overall very pleased with this purchase. Great job and love the colors
B00A80SHFM|1.0|Don't waste your money or time on this CD. They have chosen actors so the movie would attact attention from an actor's name. I was looking for artistic musical talent. There are a couple that are of high caliber but most are just actors attempting to sing. Sad! But pass this one on by!
0061733199|5.0|this book has it all from what you need in your emergency kit to what kind of plants to eat.  great to have around...just in case.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! I have a Kindle Fire and the program works perfectly and is so easy to use! I definitely recommend this app to all Pinterest users.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|it's not your average angry bird.  with no gravity in play it makes the birds launch differntly. it's fun trying to figure out how to make it work.
B000I55YVM|5.0|I can watch this movie as many times and keep laughing. I tend to dislike movies with this kind of humor, but TLY just gets to me. Also look for the original version starring Burt Reynolds.
0784011710|5.0|Great products with extreme profissionalism of international shipping. This makes me feel content and wanting to do more business with the amazon family. Concerning the movie itself, I usually buy what I already know I'm gonna get, thanks to this amazing review  system of Amazon's and to the often illustrated custumers that buy fine things at Amazon and leave their useful tips. Thank you all!
1454901276|5.0|Fascinating setting, many twists and turns in the plot, interesting characters whose relationships are intriguing! A must-read for lovers of mystery,
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Batman series has only improved itself along the time. What I'm enjoying the most in these new Batman movies are the realpolitiks aspects of the plots.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game has been played non stop by the kids, I have to make them put it away. Great game!
0525953590|5.0|A Christmas gift that turned an adult son who is normally blasé about such things into a gushing, giddy & giggling kid. I researched books on the Higgs Boson and combined with his appreciation for the author chose this book. Keep in mind if you are looking for an easy read explanation this is not the best choice. Keep in mind the author Carroll is a CalTech physicist and a basic understanding of sub atomic physics combined with a good understanding of higher maths is helpful to enjoying and understanding this book. Plus an interest in sub atomic physics! However, according to the son, this is not a dry scientific tome. The history and importance of the idea, search and discovery of the particle is covered along with the impact on science and the scientists along with the science detail.
B001YXZL7E|2.0|I expected full songs when I bought this, but found most the tracks are just excerpts. Instead of the full versions you get the same mini slices as on the movie. Don't get me wrong, I love the movie, and I enjoyed the sound track during the movie, but on its own its not worth it.
0385536828|3.0|I have read all McEwan's work and think he is a brilliant writer. 'Sweet Tooth' starts very promisingly with the portrait of a young, middle class, sheltered female character and her reactionary responses to the challenges of social and political unrest in the UK in 1972,and the Cold War.  She is recruited in Cambridge by an ex-MI5 agent and employed, in a lowly capacity as an administrative assistant, supporting agents infiltrating the IRA.  So far so good.  What I expected from McEwan was the deconstruction of her naivety and her growing understanding of social and political complexity.  But when Serena is called 'upstairs', expecting promotion to more interesting work, McEwan abruptly changes direction, and 'Sweet Tooth' becomes a reflection on the nature of writing and the sexual potency of deceit.  This is absorbing, but does not ultimately satisfy the earlier expectations.
0062082353|3.0|I would say that this book is an okay read. I have read a few books about the war on terror and this one just didnt compare to others
B008KRBTU0|5.0|The Spot it games are some of our favorites on our Wednesday night game night with our granddaughter..we all enjoy playing. Now that she is reading we bought the English one to add to the others that we love to play.

B0016PM722|3.0|My parents purchased two of Anakin's ROTS light-sabers as a Christmas Gift.  The blue hues on the sabers are a fantastic color.  There are a few things I'm slightly disappointed in, they are below.<br /><br />1) They came in a large box with minimal packing material.  Each saber is packed safely in Styrofoam in it's own box, but they were sliding around a ton in amazon's box.  This is the first time I've received something from amazon where the packaging was sub-par.  If you order just one saber, I'm not sure if you'll see this issue.  The packing material they used was the brown paper stuff, but there was not much in there (not sure why they even bothered?).<br /><br />2) Each saber is hand-made.  This can lead to inconsistencies.  One of the Anakin ROTS sabers has visible LEDs (64 in all).  The other one is fairly consistent all the way up (other than a dark spot in the middle, which is said to be \\"normal\\" for FX sabers).  The hilt's on both have fingerprints and scratches/scuffs over them.  I am not nit-picky enough to want to return either of them (maybe I'm slightly lazy).<br /><br />3) The audio in each differs slightly, but it doesn't matter much - it's just showing quality control issues.  One saber's volume is definitely louder than the other, and each are using new energizer AA batteries.  It's been said Duracell may have problems with these light sabers, as a forewarning.<br /><br />4) Here is where I was slightly disappointed.  I assumed you could shut the audio off somehow, and just have the saber lit up (no).  Secondly, the saber will auto shutoff if there is no movement detected within a short period of time (a minute or so).  So, you can forget about hanging it up on your wall and have it light up a home theater entrance area, or something. =(<br /><br />There is a hacking community seemingly composed of electrical engineering star wars geeks that have modified/soldered on modifications to the FX sabers, and others, for the sole purpose of doing the previously mentioned items (and more).<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful, overall, I am happy with the sabers - but expected a little bit more.  I'm afraid of giving this 4 stars because it will get lost in all the mainly positive reviews these sabers have received.  Half of my minor issues you may not know about, unless you need to purchase more than one of the same saber.previously mentioned items (and more).<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful, overall, I am happy with the sabers - but expected a little bit more.

B003Y5H556|4.0|Very good movie. Amanda Seyfried was excellent in this movie. Just the right amount of suspense and the scenery was gothic and haunting.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I finished the The Lost City last night. I am so impressed. The graphics are gorgeous and it's a joy just to wander around. The music is lovely and fits the game's atmosphere. This is an adventure game and, as such, there is little hand-holding. There is an inventory and a journal that helps with the story line and keeps track of clues you uncover. The puzzles range in difficulty from easy to somewhat difficult. I did get stuck a couple of times and my only complaint is that the hints were not always helpful. I can see why those who have not played adventure games before might have difficulty understanding what to do. Perhaps a short tutorial would help? This is just my type of game. I wish there were more like this.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Excellent movie. Christina looks sexy and has a fantastic voice. I have watched this movie twice and it gets better every time. Great story line, music and dancing is wonderfully loud and sexy.  Cher is great also.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|All twilight books and movies are great!! Read all the books and have all the movies, I'm 56 and really liked these
B004EPYZPI|5.0|The movie is fast paced and Matthew is smart and sexy. Good story line, very believeable. I liked that as a lawyer, he worked out of his car, no fancy office, which is different from your &#34;typical&#34; lawyer.
B002BWP49C|5.0|The books, the movies, all of it is awesome! One of the best series ever! Highly recommend it! I know there is a lot of jokes and trash going around about it, but it truly is wonderful if you give it the chance!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It has a new feel, different challenges and it's definitely better than Jewel Star because it gives the player more control and choices
B0042MEQVG|5.0|From the books to the movies, all of it is wonderful!! I highly recommend it! I know there is a lot of jokes and trash going around about the series, but it truly is amazing once you give it the chance!
B005LAIISA|4.0|I liked Continental Drift.  It was funny and Manny has problems with his daughter growing up.  Poor Scrat always in search of his acorn and never gets the nut.  Although he does get bounced around a lot when trying to get his acorn.<br /><br />They did leave it open when another Sabre Toothed Tiger came along.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This movie was wonderful!  And this product is great! The collector's edition is definintly for collectors! I highly recommend it!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I always wanted to see Magic Mike since it came out.  And it didn't fail to dissappoint.  If you don't want to go to Vegas this is closest you'll get to some of the action.  Gives you an insinde look at being a male stripper and what goes on behind the stage.<br /><br />I love this move and highly recommend it.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Love this movie!! It is hillarious and a great family film! Definintly recommend seeing! You won't be disappointed! Megamind is great!
B001GMH8RO|5.0|I love Ghost.  Ghost is one of the those classic movies that you can watch again and again. I like the part where Demi Moore is making pottery.  But I think Patrick Swayze dies too soon.
B007ZLKKZM|5.0|I loved the fabulous footage, interviews, fine editing and storytelling.  Absolutely worth owning.  Oh, and then there was the music!
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|I wasn't expecting much- just a cheesy story about a washed-up boxer redeeming himself in the eyes of his estranged son and the boxing world. This is what I wanted to see, and I got this and so much more. Academy award-worthy acting eliminates the cheese factor, and you can call it predictable, but it's more seeing-what-I-wanted-to-see.<br /><br />On top of all this, the robot effects are amazing. If the Transformers movies had gone about effects in this way, they may have had a chance of being good. If you're not into a heartwarming, feel-good family movie, watch it for the robot fights.
0930289234|5.0|A five-star classic graphic novel - flawed super-heroes, complex characters, spikey social commentary and an excellent plot make for a great read that questions our moralities.<br /><br />About:  Set in the cold war era after the end of the Vietnam War, the golden age of masked crime-fighting heroes has passed in the US, and the remnants of the \\"Watchmen\\" are either working for the government or retired. That is, all except Rorschach, a totally uncompromising crime-fighter who continues to operate outside of the law (the superheroes' activities having now been deemed illegal). Since their heyday, several have met tragic ends and now the cynical public sentiment is very much against them - even though they helped the US win the Vietnam War and their most powerful member, Dr. Manhattan, has helped the US gain the upper hand strategically in the global stand-off with the Soviet Union.<br /><br />When a final showdown with the Soviet Union seems to be imminent, one of the Watchmen, the Comedian, is brutally killed. Dr. Manhattan is then vilified in public and promptly disappears. Rorschach investigates and becomes convinced that someone is trying to murder or sideline all remaining superheroes. Is someone out for revenge? Is someone trying to tilt the balance of power back in favor of the Russians? The Night Owl comes out of retirement to help and the Silk Spectre (disenchanted partner of the missing Dr. Manhattan) also dons her crime-fighting costume, despite detesting Rorschach. They try to persuade the super-intelligent Ozymandias to help as well, but he casts doubts on their conspiracy theories and seems to be too wrapped up in running his business empire.<br /><br />As nuclear Armageddon fast approaches, some of the Watchmen struggle to untangle what is going on and try to persuade the troubled and emotionally detached Dr. Manhattan to return to Earth to help. This in turn leads to some unpleasant discoveries for the Silk Spectre. Meanwhile a youth is reading a gruesome comic book about pirates, Tales of the Black Freighter, which seems to have some uncanny parallels with what is happening in the real world.<br /><br />The ending is full of surprises and really challenges the reader to think about what is right, what is wrong, and what might just be acceptable in a world that is anything but black and white.<br /><br />John's thoughts:  Well, I never thought that my first five-star rating would be for a graphic novel, but here I am and this is most definitely worthy of five stars. If you have notions about the graphic novel art form being adolescent and unintelligent, banish them and read this book.<br /><br />The characters are remarkably complex and interesting, especially Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan. The plot twists and turns all over the place and I had no idea how it would all end up. The ending is remarkably thought-provoking. And it's nice that Moore doesn't try to lay out what he thinks - in essence the various characters have extreme and differing views on what is morally right and what isn't, and the reader is left to decide what she/he thinks.<br /><br />There is so much more to enjoy about the book. It's a wonderfully dark story; it lays bare the shallowness and venality of the world we live in; nothing is black or white; thanks in large part to the activities of the Watchmen, Richard Nixon is enjoying his fifth term as US president (truly scary); the graphics are excellent; and despite much of the bleakness, it's actually a fun read.<br /><br />I'd unequivocally rate the book five stars. If you like dark superhero stories or any books that are deeply thought-provoking, this one is for you. If you've never ventured into the world of graphic novels, this is a great place to start.<br /><br />P.S. When the movie version of Watchmen came out in 2009, many Watchmen purists panned it. I don't agree. A movie could never pick up all of the subtleties and intricacies of a novel like this, but the Watchmen movie was hugelyentertaining, fun and, as with the book, very thought-provoking. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Whether you have read the book or not, I'd recommend giving the movie a go.entertaining, fun and, as with the book, very thought-provoking.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. I have not set and read a book in just 3 days before. I can't wait yo read the next book.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It came nicely packaged, included all 8 films in one unit, a lot of the box sets are using regular DVD cases I like the one they used for this box set. The quality was very good for DVDs although there is a blueray version of this available too if you want very high quality.<br /><br />I'm not supposed to rate the film but if I was I would be taking a star away. This was the first time I had seen the ending and was very disappointed. It felt rushed and not well made. But because I'm not rating the actual video on the disks I still give it 5 stars.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Although I have issues with how in depth the book got,it was a quick, thoughtful and interesting read. Worth the purchase.
B005LAIISU|3.0|Christmas present from family as I had enjoyed the first 3 so much, but was more than a little disappointed in this effort.  CGI is excellent, but the antagonist ape and crew are awful, can you say Jar Jar Binks???  Should have sent that whole idea to the trash can and found a different storyline.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is a book I couldn't put down it was awesome loved it. I wished it wouldn't of ended it was full of suspense and drama and a true love story I highly recommend it !!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Finished the second book in less than 24 hours. Great books!!!!! I highly recommend this book! Can't wait to read the third one!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book it holds so many feelings and so many emotions that I nearly cried but I still enjoyed this marvelous book
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I recommend this book! I was surprised how quickly I got into this story. I began reading the prologue and couldn't put it down. I loved the mystery established with what was real and what was in the narrator's imagination in the beginning and was immediately interested in every character.  The story reminded me of Goonies meets Harry Potter and I loved it.  The old photographs included were icing on the cake. Thanks for a great story, Randsom Riggs!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is actually one of the best games I have ever played in a way it is actually kind of addictive!!!!!!!!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I wouldn't even waste your time downloading this app. It shows you about 10 posts in fb then does not work. People have been complaining about it for months now, and it still is not fixed.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this is a great app for people to access their computer remotely. much easier to carry my tablet to meetings and still have full pc access.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|Difficult to locate in stores. This was requested as a Christmas gift and where we live I could not find this CD. Very pleased and made someone happy.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I love this book it is amazing if I had to choose a book it will be by this Arthur
034580404X|5.0|Brand new, excellant packaging. Purchased as a Christmas gift. I had a difficult time locating elsewhere as this is quite popular.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I thought that this book amazing. Couldn't put it down. This is the best book ever. If I were you I would read it.
1451695195|5.0|Our son was killed and this book was recommended to us. It is an excellant read and the quality is perfect.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Wonderful read! LOVED IT LOVED it LOVED it! Surprising ending left me at the edge of my seat
0307592731|3.0|Ex-prom queen Cheryl Strayed has recently lost her mother to cancer, and her marriage has fallen apart--so she decides to take a hike. Well, she's read some books about the Pacific Crest Trail, and decides hiking from the Mojave Desert to the Pacific Northwest isn't such a bad idea. Plus, she believes her mother's spirit will guide her in her journey.<br /><br />Her retelling of how clueless she was before starting the hike--\\"How hard can a hike be? I walk everywhere.\\"--and her lack of planning--or shall we say selective planning, because she remembers certain things at the expense of others--is skillful and borderline-comical, if she weren't putting herself in grave danger with such misjudgments; at one point she even loses her hiking boots over a cliff and has to reinforce her camp sandals with duct tape to get her to the next resupply box. Her huge, unwieldy pack is dubbed \\"Monster,\\" and at one point a fellow hiker helps her cull the things she absolutely won't need, and put them in the \\"free\\" box in a town where she's stopped--although she retrieves one condom, just in case.<br /><br />I consider myself something of an urban hiker, covering about ten miles a day, and I still would balk at going anywhere there wasn't pretty good cellphone coverage. Before I was halfway through the book, I found myself thinking of her as \\"Feral Cheryl\\"--so far, no review I've read of this book even mentions the Australian doll of that name--and by the end she's found out her \\"trail name:\\" \\"Queen of the PCT.\\" All along the way, people naturally want to help her because she's a [blond] woman alone. (There are three male hikers she runs into a few times, and they admit nobody is compelled to do anything for them, because they're three guys together.)<br /><br />Naturally, Cheryl learns some life lessons, and finds the hike prepares her for things she couldn't have known otherwise. It doesn't make me want to go take a hike, but I can appreciate the drive to do so. You can't take such a monumental hike and come away unscathed.a monumental hike and come away unscathed.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|I am just an economic layman (or woman rather) with a casual interest in economics.  This book was fascinating and somewhat scary when you read about what some of these Wall Street firms/banks did.  Michael Lewis conveys everything in plain terms that the average reader can understand; and he does a great job summarizing many of the factors and people behind the housing and financial crisis.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The book is well written and written with Mitch's unique style of storytelling.  We will never look at time the same, again.
B0043JDUNS|3.0|When this movie came out, I was anticipating so much more.  Instead, I got a movie that was dull witted, obvious, and at times just plain stupid.  I mean, Iron Man ends with Iron Man fighting with another Iron Man.  This movie brings us... Iron Man fighting 100 other Iron Men.
141659521X|5.0|This is a new book from Vince Flinn, I would buy all of his books they are always great !!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have 4 camera bags of varying sizes. This one holds the most, plus I can strap my little gorilla-pod on the side. I've only used it on one trip, but I'm thinking it may become my favorite. Great value for the price.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. So many twists and turns beautifully woven together k the lives of Sky and Holder.  I miss them already!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This app has the most Mahjong games on it I have found: 160! It is well organized so you can get right to the games. It offers a variety of game board formats. I have lots of friends who enjoy playing it too.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This was a gift for my son, it's his favorite movie!!  We've already watched it several times since he opened his stocking Christmas morning!
B0053O89WY|5.0|We have purchased each season to tickle our funny bones and our brains. The only negative is that it has no closed captioning which is inconsiderate to hearing impaired fans. UPDATE- A fellow Amazon customer helped me figure out how to activate the captions on this DVD. I apologize to THE BIG BANG and have raised your score from 4 to 5 stars. This show is fabulous!
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|While this is considered an Alien prequel, I loved it as a stand alone film. More than anything it was beautiful to look at. I don't want to give too much away, so I'll just say this; the strength this movie has going for it is the scope. It's grand fun with your token &#34;chest bursting&#34; moment.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I liked this free app so much I bought the full game. It offers a variety of boards. The tiles are crisp & clear. I find this game fun yet relaxing.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I bought it because I am a Daft Punk fan.  The audio and video were very good and put alot more context into the songs.  A must have for your collection!!
B006M4F67A|3.0|Not as many game boards as some apps but has some different ones. The tiles can hide behind each other. I enjoy it.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Bought for my 10 yr old son along with a Kindle Fire for Christmas.  He is really enjoyed playing the other Angry Bird versions in the past, but likes this one because of the cool Star Wars references. Can you defeat the pork side?
0811874192|4.0|This book is well made and very intricate. It allows you to add color & interest to your coffee table in the winter without watering the flowers. Makes for a cute conversation piece. I liked it so much I gave one as a gift and kept one for me.
B00931JMRE|3.0|The new album from ZZ Top. In this album they are making an attempt to go for a more blue's feel. It is not like their mainstream stuff. There are a couple of catchy tunes in this album, but I got it on a deal from Amazon so I figured I would give it a whirl.
B00846REIS|5.0|I chose this book after reading 50 shades of gray. It was a good read, got me over the 50's withdrawal. Can't wait to read the next book.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Ordered this as a Christmas gift for my son.  The movies are terrific and the quality of the picture on blue-ray is<br />fantastic.  Arrived quickly.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Love Harrison Ford, Love these, Love adventure movies, Love these, Love your collection to attractive casing? Love these! All of it is good, and great to have
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Ordered this as a Christmas gift for my son.  The movie was terrific and the quality of the picture on blue-ray is<br />fantastic.  Arrived quickly.
B005DOKIYG|1.0|This zippered sleeve does not fit a Fire HD..  The HD is too wide and I was not aware of this when it was ordered.  I'll have to return it.
1451662432|5.0|Ordered this for my son for Christmas.  He is very excited to read it, so I can't comment on the content yet.  Arrived quickly.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I sent this to a friend in Texas who loves Disney movies and she loved it .. Great gift idea from Amazon ..
B001DHXT6G|5.0|After watching this series in syndicated rerun I was stunned by how much was edited out of these episodes. The enhanced special effects aren't intrusive and add a lot to the episodes.It's amazing how well the series holds up and this cleaned up and enhanced video makes it a must have for anyone who enjoys really consistently good science fiction.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and after watching it again just recently, I decided that I needed to own it.  (I'm not really a buy the movie kind of person.)  It's a thoughtful story and the sound track is wonderful.
B0064W652A|5.0|This one had its up and down fast paced keeps you guess. Makes you doubt what you know and bam.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|please get this app! I love this app a lot and hope you like it too. get this app or else you will be missing out all the great fun
B000EWBKM6|5.0|If you own the rest of the series, than you need to own the series finale. it comes around full circle.
140120841X|5.0|Yes the product was just as they said it would be. We were very happy with it and my son liked it.
B000AGTPUU|2.0|The Polar Exspress dvd that I received will not play on my lap top or my son's dvd player.. Very disappointed.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This game is very catching in my opinion almost exactly like the real version. But I love it! So get it
B008B3MZMY|5.0|I've been waiting years for a concert film of Supertramp to be released. Finally it's here and well worth the wait. It's too bad that the band can't put their scabbles aside and tour but it looks like that will never happen. This is the next best thing. A fantastic setlist and really, a fine job on overall productoin. It far excided my expectatoins of a concert filmed in the 70's. Get it before it's pulled.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome is you are bored! I cant stop playing sometimes.(warning this is all true) if you don't believe me
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is the best of the twilight by far<br />Everyone will love this amazing awesome series ...........I love this book
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is awesome. I love to play this with my friends. And its great if your facebook friends have one too.
B008ULRY78|5.0|As I stated above. Very realistic and great action and suspensful !A very very good movie, I must say. Great
B00004TS0E|5.0|Awesome service everything was perfect I would buy form the vendor again great service fast, easy and convient again awesome
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book kept you guessing the whole time.  I couldn't stop reading it.  The suspense was insane.  Great job Gillian Flynn.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This movie was so bad.  I hated every second of it.  There were points that it went beyond bad to just completely disgusting.  My date loved it.  It was our last date.  Anyone that could love this kind of disgusting crude \\"humor\\" doesn't have a whole lot upstairs.  Seriously, skip it, you will not miss anything.  Just thinking about some of the scenes with the stupid bear make me want to throw up.  Really, so not necessary.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Nice little game and quite addictive, although you will get through the levels fairly quickly. only struggled with a couple of the levels so could do with more colours to make them more difficult.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Arrived quickly and it was a great christmas stocking item. We  love Mumford! It was a gift for my husband (and myself of course!)
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I cannot recommend this game.  It has potential, and  I've seen the developers make some adjustments in the past month, so I gave it two stars, but there are a few MAJOR issues that need to be worked out.<br /><br />One: the in-game economy.  It is initially free-to-play, and one would expect there will be the option to pay some real money for special items if desired.  Usually $10 or so is reasonable, but Gameloft wants you to spend from $100-$250 to complete the game by purchasing \\"gems\\".  No joke.  Sure, you can collect five free gems every 5 days...but you can lose them all in one accidental swipe on the screen.  Don't let your little girl play the game, she'll cost you. (\\"Sorry sweetie, the ponies are cute...but you'll lose all my gems\\"!!)  Kind of a bummer to have on your device.<br /><br />Second:  the social set up.  It's just plain broken.  You are supposed to be able to add friends from Facebook or through the onboard Gameloft engine so friends can gift each other another form of currency (hearts).  The connection to Facebook doesn't work, when you do manually add a friend they maybe (sometimes if you are lucky) show up on your game list, and occasionally you can gift them.....and please don't try to visit their cities to leave a chest.  The game crashes and it takes too long to cycle through all your friends, should you be able to accumulate any.<br /><br />Third:  no love for android users.  I have this game on my Kindle Fire.  It's pretty, the ponies are adorable, they play, prance and talk and I love that.  However, apparently there have been updates, and offers of additional gems, etc for iOS users, but not for me.  What gives?  Even after you figure out that 100k users x $10 per upgrade is better than 100 users x $100-$250 per upgrade (no math isn't that hard), if you can't scoop up the android users (I'll assume Gameloft has heard of the Kindle Fire or the Galaxy Note, etc?) then you're just hurting your potential fan base.<br /><br />I want to give you five stars Gameloft.  Now get to it! :)you five stars Gameloft.  Now get to it! :)
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love it. Expensive but you can play just fine without buying anything, just takes a little longer.  I would recommend it.
0553386794|5.0|I am not normally a fan of the \\"fantasy\\" genre but I am a huge fan of long books in a long series so I picked this up to give it a try.  I am not sorry.  To me this reads more like historical fiction than fantasy (dragons aside) and although there are dozens of characters to keep straight, each is written so well that the book is not overly confusing.  By the time I finished this wonderful story, I couldn't wait to get to the next book.  I'm very happy that I came to the party late so that I don't have to wait for each new installment!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I found this app really cool. I would say that this app deserves five stars because it entertained my parents and my siblings. An amazing app that is fun for all
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have Mahjong on my computer and love playing it. Now I have it on my Kindle Fire and it is just as fun. Challenging distraction from everyday life.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Very very very good movie! I've already watch it multiple times! It's definitely one of those movies that doesn't get old!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Nice gameplay and I love that it is so customizable! The ads in between games are extremely annoying though, but for free it's not too bad.
B004AKCME8|5.0|This is a very good film. Bought it for my grandkids and ended up liking it myself. The price was right also.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have this app for both my phone and Kindle. Love it! They update it often and for once the updates actually improve the app, highly recommend!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Trekkie boyfriend was very happy to receive this for his birthday.  I highly recommend the movie with the whales. Just say yes.
B00A757EFW|4.0|As far as free games go, this is a pretty good one. You only get 3 tries before having to start a new game, but the gameplay itself is good.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|A gift to my grandson. No info to review. Will assume it is fine unless I hear differently. It arrived on time.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Got app for my Kindle, and so far I haven't had the issues that I have dealt with on my phone. Just got it though, so we will see.
B005HSL626|2.0|My 10-yr-old daughter finds it to be on the boring side. She thinks it would be more fun if there were more to do than just chop fruit.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great to have the pro version w/out the commercials. Really like that I can find stations around the world that play the music I love (especially since the public jazz station here for years said they were the only one of their kind - HA! found lots around the world!)
B0094BB4TW|2.0|not very good. works better just using the browser on the kindle, the app is very limited in what it shows. will probably remove
B00A757EFW|4.0|Seems just like the old pac man game from the arcades.  I have the same problem with the joystick. word.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|I originally had this movie on VHS and decided to upgrade to Blu-ray.  What a difference!  Excellent picture quality and sound, plus I appreciated the extra bonus features, which includes an interview with Maureen O'Hara.  Extremely happy with this item!
B0081SPK0I|3.0|Reminds me of an arcade game from back in the early 90's.  Not too shabby. Five more words are here.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Terrible language, glorified illegal activities, just plain dumb! Not worth your precious time. Nothing more than juvenile humor. Save your $1.99.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app works well, but it doesn't allow you to do everything you can do on the web. For example, I can't delete certain things from my timeline, like photos. But, otherwise, it works fine.
B007P6VLRS|2.0|I've been listening to the Pumpkins for a long time. They were the first band I seriously spent money on. These MP3 previews are enough to tell me this isn't the Pumpkins. Anyone can tell that since the best 3 members are also missing.<br /><br />I also have been listening to Tool and Deftones for close to the same amount of time. What I find funny is Maynard has made 2 other bands besides Tool and almost all his work has been great.<br /><br />Billy seems to be telling us that he's not longer \\"just a rat in a cage\\" but rather he's a millionaire with nothing else to say.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|Moneyball  Movie was great and especially in Blue Ray. I am a Baseball fan and I knew the history of this Manager.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Got this for the family, all 8 movies in a single over sized clam-shell case.  Great picture quality and easy to locate all the movies.  Not a collectors set, but a great family entertainment bundle for sure!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie tremendously. Never got a chance to see it in the theater so bringing it home was great for me.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Dr. Seuss is as always great for all ages, our entire family can sit and enjoy this over and over!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|People are always looking for free news or magazines.  This is the perfect app! It's entertaining, easy, and very informative.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Dr. Seuss is as always great for all ages, our entire family can sit and enjoy this over and over!
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The knob on the side of the case that is suppose to turn the volume off and on didn't work.  Difficult to get case off and on.  More frustrating when I couldn't just exchange it.  Had to return for a credit.
B003NX76BM|2.0|I am very disappointed in this book by one of my very favorite authors.  I feel like I am reading a \\"tutorial\\" on how to train dogs.  A little bit of that might be interesting but way too much of the book is devoted to dry teaching methods of search and rescue dogs.  The book was promoted as a \\"serial killer mystery\\" but very little of the story is actually a mystery and though I haven't yet finished it, the buildup to the conclusion is way too slow and boring.  Usually I count the pages (or percentage on my Kindle) to the end with regret because I don't want it to end.  With this book I can hardly wait to finish it and get on to something I will enjoy.  My first time not to love a Nora Roberts book!
B000WQW988|5.0|If you are a Nirvana or Kurt Cobain fan, you really need to buy this DVD.  It is the best one out there.  Up close, personal, in-your-face Kurt.  The quality is nothing short of amazing, you feel like you were there.  The most breathtaking performances by Cobain are when he is singing songs by himself; no one but him & his acoustic guitar.  His voice was absolutely incredible; he was \\"Nirvana.\\"
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is a fun game. I just hate the pop up ads after each hand. Otherwise it would get 5 stars from me. I understand why they hv the ads. But I still don't lk them
B002MRRRAA|5.0|This one's worth the money!  Kurt's humor is great, the band is fantastic, sound quality & image quality is very well done.  I only wish Love wasn't still making money off of them.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|How can you go wrong with Bruce Springsteen.  He will rock forever.  Love the CD.  It's in the car player and played often.  Thanks Bruce!
B00APUQJLO|2.0|Hard to follow. As amazing as I think Robert Pattinson is... he couldn't save this movie. No wonder it never even made it to theaters here in LV.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|What's not to love about a wonderful mashup of Disney, aliens, Hawaii and Elvis?! Adorable film! I have to be honest... my 2 yo daughter would still rather watch Winnie the Pooh, but one day, she'll love this too!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|It was a good movie, a little on the gorey side with shootings and violence. But interesting history about prohibition.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't find nothing I dislike<br />So I love the hunger games and I also love the move can't wait to Sat the second one
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Awesome movie!  I wanna watch this movie once a week forever!  I could watch it over and over.  Funny, Great Soundtrack!  It's a must see!
0345803507|5.0|After reading the first two books of the trilogy, I was curious to know how it ended. I was not disappointed.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid.  I hadn't seen it in a decade or more.  I still love it!
0345803493|5.0|The first book in this trilogy peaked my interest enough for me to want to purchase the second one to find out how the story progressed.  It was a fun read!!!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Sturdy, nice case. It protects my kindle and it fits perfectly. I would recommend it. It´s for my son´s kindle, so he doesn´t use the standing feature too much, but I tried it and it works.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was definitely the best book I've ever read. I love how it's full of action and adventure with a little hint of romance. I would recommend this book to the youth and adults everywhere
030745455X|5.0|I was glad to be able to purchase this book.  it was a great buy, and I would recommend it.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|This book is very intense and descriptive.  It is well written and I could not put it down.  I wanted to stop reading at several spots, but could lay it down.  It's like a train wreck.  You feel bad for looking but can't stop lol!!!
B00540G3G6|5.0|Our adult children, as well as their young neices and nephews really like to watch any available movie in 3D.  The were happy to receive this Blue-ray 3D movie as a gift.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great movie, but the bear may be scary for some children.  My 2 years-old was a little frightened, but I turned the volume down during the bear's scenes and it was OK for her.  My 6 years-old liked it a lot and watches it quite often.
B005LAII08|5.0|Very good movie that lends itself to the 3D genre.  It was so much fun to watch it in 3D.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I liked the original with Arnold, and I thought Arnold did a decent job of acting. Decent I said. This film had the advantage of huge advances in technology that lends itself to this kind of si-fi action. The female actors were not any better than the originals, both were excellent, but Colin Farrell played the part better, and I thought that the background changes to the plot and keeping it on earth made it more believable. I thought I would miss Mars, but there was so much going on I did not have time. I thought shutting down a synthetic robot army was more believable than starting up an ancient alien artifact. Plus I did not have to watch Arnold overact while gasping for air!
0307454541|5.0|I was very happy to be able to purchase this book.  It was impossible to find it anywhere locally.  Great buy!
B00A757EFW|5.0|this is so much fun-easy controls-just tap on once and it goes until one changes the direction manually-and since it's free it's even better-don't miss out on it
B00884GR0W|1.0|Worst game it's way to big of a place.  Terrible alternative to minecraft. If you want a good alternative to minecraft get survival craft.  This game isn't even worth a penny.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I thought it was a very good book. I like authors that follow there character all the way in the story. The pantheris a very good read. I had a hard time putting it down.
075669812X|5.0|Gave the book as a gift to a 6 year old who love Ninjago and he LOVED the book, he couldn't put it down all night!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Zombies, guns, and mayhem.  Who doesn't like the post-apocalyptic zombie adventure???  A great series that can be watched repeatedly (important for purchasing DVD's) and still retain its entertainment value.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I Love this book in general. Good classic to read and have. Nice immediate delivery to my Kindle. No complaints whatsoever.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|if you like great harmonizing this is the movie to see. from the very begining (universal logo) to the end of the movie you'll be entertained
B008UJDOOC|5.0|It is great I love one direction  if you are a one direction super fan like me you will love it
B003K16P3M|4.0|It was very interesting nothing like I would have expected it to be but I still loved it. Cracking is an amazing book/series and I hope you love it as much as I do.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is ALOT OF FUNN!!!!!!! I love ALL HOG games of G5!!!!!!! Wish they would make MORE, FASTER!!!!!!!!!!! AND A LIL CHEAPER!!!!!!!!!BUT THANKS FOR ALL THE GREAT GAMES!!!!!!! REALLY THOUGH MORE FASTER!!!!!!!!!! :~)
B000SGRONM|3.0|Funny at times but not as good as some of his previous work.  It makes one wonder, if some of us just have a finite amount of talent.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|I had to parches tokins and I did it so many times my mom got so mad oatmeal I slant. four hungerd dollar's. because. of. this duke app if it did not have that duke add this or what ever I did It would be a good app<br />and I would say this app is good for 11and under
B007QPFGJW|3.0|A good story although the translation makes it hard to follow sometimes.  Damn, Scandinavians.  What are they smoking over there?
B00846TTDG|3.0|Some good scenes, murphy is strangely absent throughout most of the fighting and plans go off without a hitch generally.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Easy to use.  Like the plans that you can choose from with daily bible verses from different preachers.  Love the note section.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I enjoyed watching it, but the plot had a large number of holes and it is by far the weakest of the trilogy.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|I will say that \\"Love Never Dies\\" has to be accepted on it's own terms; it might be considered sacrilege for a number of diehard Phans. There are people who have made up their minds to hate it without experiencing it for themselves.  What the haters refuse to acknowledge is that taste is subjective, and telling people that they \\"shouldn't\\" like a show because the writer doesn't like it isn't reasonable, and is very disrespectful.  A chacun son gout.  Watch the download and decide for yourself if you want to hedge your bets before buying the Blu-ray/DVD.  Consider this show independent of the 1986 \\"Phantom of the Opera,\\" and just enjoy the show for yourself.  If you like it, you like it, and if you don't, it's your right, but don't be presumptuous and tell other people that they don't have the right to enjoy this production.  For everyone who comes up with a dozen reasons why this version of \\"Love Never Dies\\" is wrong, all I can think of is how the music and the performances in this disc moved me emotionally and brought me to tears.  It's been 20 years since I saw a Phantom who made me feel what I felt when I saw this.  This Phantom reminds me why I fell in love with the character in the first place, and why my heart ached for him when he was left by Christine.  And for all the Phangirls who are ticked off saying this is Webber's version of Christine/Sarah who should have stayed with the Phantom, tell me that these same women didn't fantasize about staying with the Phantom themselves, if they had been Christine, at the end of the original show.<br /><br />I admit to being one of the people who was outraged, outraged I tell you, at the thought that Andrew Lloyd Webber couldn't leave well enough alone. How dare he write a sequel to his greatest success, all for the purpose of making another bundle of cash?!!!  Truth be told, I wasn't a fan of Ramin Karimloo's snarling interpretation of the Phantom.  I'd seen the original Phantom, Michael Crawford, perform the role onstage a few times when Michael Mania ruled the theater world, and individual tickets for his performances were being scalped for thousands of dollars.  Aside from Crawford, I also saw Robert Guillome, and the later iterations of what the Times termed \\"industrial strength\\" tenors, where the power of the voice overwhelmed the subtle characterization that Crawford had coaxed out of the music on the stage (whatever you hear on the original cast recording, he was 100 times better in person - truly the role of a lifetime).  A trusted friend bought the \\"Love Never Dies\\" concept discs and derided the plot, and of course the reviews for the show in London were less than kind.  I happened to be flipping channels and caught this from the beginning for the first time on PBS and thought that I might as well watch the thing since it was rather irrational to have an absolute loathing for something without having seen more than the promotional video for one song.  I am now a huge fan thanks to this disc and cast.<br /><br />I'd vaguely remembered hearing that this Australian production was a big improvement over the London company so I watched, at first with trepidation.  By the time Ben Lewis' Phantom had finished singing his opening number, \\"Til I Hear You Sing Once More,\\" I realized I was wrong.  I tried resisting, and then was captivated by the lush beauty of the score. Anna O'Byrne makes a wonderful Christine, with a lighter and more controlled voice than Sarah Brightman's current work, and much more measured than Sierra Boggess, who has a tendency to allow the emotion to get the better of her singing.  O'Byrne's rendition of the title song is a moment much like Magnolia in \\"Show Boat\\" hesitating before she sings \\"After the Ball\\" or original Christine's tentative first verse of \\"Think of Me.\\"  It transitions into a powerful song with lyrics that speak to anyone who has loved deeply and lost, but survived the experience.  Simon Gleeson happens to be one of those generic interchangeable industrial strength tenors (why do all the Raouls sound exactly the same?), and he's got the thankless task of portraying a lost soul in the midst of a bad marriage.  The tension in the scenes between Raoul and Christine looks uncomfortably familiar to anyone who's been married for more than 10 years; however, Gleeson's duet with Lewis in \\"Devil Take the Hindmost\\" is a pretty tasty bit of theater.  Maria Mercedes channels Mrs. Danvers as a manipulative, cunning Mme Giry, and poor Sharon Millerchip also has a thankless task in showing us little Meg's descent from hopeful performer on the verge of a big break to a woman scorned in the craziest way possible.<br /><br />The scenic and costume design are superb; the designer here reminds us why Australians have a reputation for imaginative, over the top design - nothing generic about what's on the stage.  The use of modular track pieces to suggest the Coney Island amusement park are brilliantly utilized, and the over-sized Phantom's mask as the proscenium arch for Phantasma's concert hall is an inspired touch.  The most amazing set pieces are the carousel in the \\"Coney Island Waltz\\" and the over-sized glass cases in \\"The Beauty Underneath,\\" as some of the side-show freaks working for the Phantom are revealed.  However, I do have to quibble a bit about the execution in the tailoring and fit of the mens frock coats.  Maria Bjornson did such a phenomenal job with her original designs in 1986, and Crawford's costumes were tailored within an inch of his life, giving the Phantom a touch of the dandy about him.  The reasoning was that since his face was hideous the Phantom used his expensive, perfectly cut clothing as a way to make himself attractive and seductive.  That exquisite tailoring should have been continued here, showing the perceived wealth of Raoul and the financial success of the Phantom.  The problem with Blu-ray on a big screen HDTV is that every pucker, wrinkle, and pull in the fabric shows in the medium and close-up shots.  I was guessing certain costumes were made of a polyester blend because of the way fabric was rippling near the seams, and that took me out of the story on subsequent viewings.  (So this is where I admit to being a former stage and television actress, and being persnickety about what the actors wear, having spent enough of my past life being pinned, poked, and fitted by costume designers 20 years ago.)<br /><br />Love Never Dies is about grasping the opportunity for a last chance at redemption and healing through love.  For those who complain that it's not canon, canon is the original Leroux novel, and everything that has come after is simply another adaptation.  Like \\"Scarlett,\\" the Mitchell Estate approved sequel to \\"Gone with the Wind,\\" or \\"Phantom\\" by Susan Kaye, this is indeed glorified fan fiction, but what a story!  There are thousands of possibilities in the time period between the Phantom's cri de coeur, \\"it's over now, the music of the night\\" and the original prologue of Raoul in 1911 singing \\"will you still play when all the rest of us are dead?\\"  Either way, Christine's fate was spelled out in 1986.  I admit that part of me feels that Ben Lewis is about 20 years too young to be playing the Phantom at this stage of life with his unlined face, considering that the Leroux character was an older man, and Crawford was 44 when he created the role.  Going by the Frederick Forsythe book as the basis for LND, the Phantom here is closer to a contemporary of Christine, so in the disconnect between the two ALW versions, unless the Phantom's magical powers included freezing or bending time, the change would have made him a teen at the time he created the maze of mirrors for the Shah of Persia in the original, but I digress.  The original Phantom has lived multiple lives in his roles as side-show freak, magician, composer, architect, and Opera Ghost.  I've found that Lewis may be young but he has the charisma and gravitas to pull it off.<br /><br />Ben Lewis is truly heartbreaking as the Phantom.  He exposes the yearning soul of this tortured man who has learned to come out of the shadows and operate above ground in his park, Phantasma.  Yes, the Phantom does fall back on old methods in resorting to threats to get Christine to agree to sing in his concert hall, but on discovering the truth about little Gustave, he finds another path to redeeming himself, and his generosity of spirit is expressed here.  The monster has a heart and soul that can be mended.  I have to say that Ben Lewis has one of the truly great voices of musical theater, a breathtaking instrument, and I hope that he has the opportunity to work in the U.S., because I would love to see him from the seats of a theater, rather than on my home screen.  His use of nuance in posture, holds, and turning is well-crafted, and he's got a great crazy stare in the moments when it's warranted.  I also noticed he uses his hands in a way that echoes Crawford's original performance, and it's a lovely nostalgic touch for someone who saw the original Phantom in the flesh.  The chemistry between Lewis and Anna O'Byrne here is palpable.  You absolutely believe their history and unbreakable bond.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone who's willing to open up their mind and go beyond the original show, and it's a vast improvement over the travesty of the film version of Phantom with Gerard Butler.  This Angel of Music has a voice that soars and seeps into your consciousness, then remains there like the echoes of your long-lost love.  It's well worth your time and money.

B009NQKPUW|2.0|In an interview Ridley Scott stated he wanted to make a movie to make people think about what it is to be human, as blade runner did.  That pretty much failed in my opinion.  Maybe a sequel could save it, but as it is, its just a bad, high budget creature film.<br />I would like to see an engineer/predator crossover though.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Although it is a Walt Disney film the movies that they produce always have a wonderful lesson. My kids and I enjoyed it
1419705849|5.0|My sin liked this book so much that he went straight through it in two days. He is 8 years old and in the third grade. I know he read the book because I have him read out loud (that's because I really don't trust him to read to himself) that way I can help him with the harder words and help him understand the storyline if need be. The story was a funny one and I actually liked it. LOL. And obviously he liked it because he read straight through and willfully read more than what I require him too. The book can on time like I have come to expect from Amazon.
6305428042|5.0|Best Halloween movie ever. I have been watching this movie for years and would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Halloween
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Its alright. Not as funny as i thought it was going to be though. . . . . . .
0345803485|5.0|This is the first of the three books in the trilogy. It was by far one of the best books I have ever read. I would recommend this book to people who really get into reading and like having mutlipe books in a series
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|It's clear that this is a live recording for a movie & not something that is presented on a stage so the voices aren't as polished as you would hear on a Broadway or West End stage but what it lacks in that area....the intensity & emotion that the actors are putting behind their vocal performance more than makes up for it. It's amazing!
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Great movie, I would recommend buying this product to people who are fans of the Twilight Saga. Sends fast and great quality.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|this is a simple and entertaining game for any my little pony fan. however,  it will take a long time or a lot of money. to complete. the other dissapointment is once you max out the stars on a pony,  you cannot play with them any more. still I'm willing to give it a 4 star rating based on all the factors going into playing this game. Ps parents,  make sure to turn off the auto purchase option.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was my favorite out of the three books. I would recommend the kindle version to anyone who has the kindle ap.
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|Okay...c'mon. If you are watching this, then you are not looking for academy award-winning acting. It's a dance movie with good-looking people who can act a bit...and are working hard to make a mediocre script work. If you know that going in...then you're all good. The dancing was fantastic...and the stars were likable and not that bad. It was worth the watch for me.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|Great movie and good quality ! Brought this for a good laugh, I would recommend to anyone who likes funny movies.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|we loved this movie.  it was a great family movie.  very well made and the story line is heart changing but enjoyable at the same time.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|Great movie, if you are a Harry Potter fan I would recommend this to you! One of my favorites in the series
B007N5YIUS|1.0|The angry birds game didn't work when I tried to use it. None of the apps I got from amazon worked.
037582913X|5.0|This was my favorite book to read to my little brother when he was small, so I bought it for my son when he was born.  He loves Grover and the (very bad) impression I do of him.  I even bought a Grover hand puppet to read the book to him.  Super cute little story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This site is so helpful I can't tell you how many times I have sent friends and family to one of my boards to give them information to help them with repair,decorating, or craft tips and ideas.  Everyone loves it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really liked this book a lot.  I don't usually read mysteries, but I read a review for this in Entertainment Weekly and thought I'd give it a try.  The plot was quite different from what I expected.  It's hard to write too much about this without giving it away, but I can say that it's very well-written and well thought out without any obvious plot holes.  With so many so-so books out there, this one really stands out as a great one.  I highly recommend.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was very enjoyable. It is full of emotions we can all relate to. I would recommend it to others.
0425263916|4.0|I loved this book. I was a huge fan of fifty shades of grey and still am but I enjoy Sylvia's trilogy better.
8866130931|5.0|Great product! Well-made and I love this format in particular because I have the organization of a calendar on the left and the freedom of a notebook on the right.
0345803493|4.0|This book was great. Picked up where the first left off. Still steamy and just a good read. Would recommend.
B008YP272M|4.0|Christopher has a place among the most witty and insightful social and literary commentators of our time. He brings the depth and breadth of his knowledge to the reader and through his profound and well conceived insights enriches our understanding of our own lives. He is sorely missed
B001VPJYZK|5.0|Well Desperate Housewives is great and I would have to say this season was awesome. I am an owner of all the seasons and if you are a true fan you will be too.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this story! Much better than the first novel! Can not wait to read the third! Wasn't close to Fifty Shades.
0345803507|4.0|The finally book in the fifty shades trilogy rounds it off perfectly. I loved this book the most of the three.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was so amazing, I have always loved Nicholas sparks and its for a good reason. All of his books are inspiring and make you never want to put the book down. I can't wait for him to come out with another book, but in the meantime I'm going to read the few other books of his that I haven't read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book so much I could not put it down.  I'm so excited to read the second one.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Would of liked more at ending.<br />Where they went from there a baby a real wedding but overall it was a good book
B0084BMUFA|2.0|I am a Dickens fan but 'A Christmas Carol' isn't my cup of tea...it's dark and sermonising, not what I really want at Christmas time :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I already read the books and watched the movie, but when I read it again I understood it more. I love the hunger games
B00AJLHUYO|4.0|Ethan Hawke's performance makes this movie. Otherwise, it would have never risen above the cusp of mediocrity. Sinister boasts nothing spectacular as far as plot goes: found Super 8 footage reveals a murder mystery that is up to our unlikely hero to solve. Our protagonist, however, is not a pimply punk seconds from death by pick axe nor is he a grizzled small-town cop who has had one too many bottles of Wild Turkey. He is a true crime novelist chasing his next NYT bestseller. This movie succeeds on three levels: (1) snuff footage that is gruesome enough to be original, (2) an atmospheric score, and (3) the creation of a ghost world that bows but doesn't break the fourth wall. The film falls flat in the final act, but still packs enough punch to be one hell of a ride.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think this was the best book ever! I can\\"t wait for the next one! I finished the book in two days!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Love it but why does it need Internal Storage Space to update?.I don't have any space and where is the pink bird?No ANGRY BIRDS &trade; update.I want the pink bird( but I am a boy)!.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This game is fun and all, but there are 5 different ads every time you open the game.  I understand its a free game and all, but many times I have been trying to serve food after I THINK the ads are over but one will come up late and try to rope me into buying 100 gems for  $10.  Another issue is the fact that they made a company profile and befriended all player not at all asking their permission and then the profile is completely turn by bots which delete wall comments and Give the free gems.  Finally, there is infinite organ feature in the game so there is no player security against bullies who only get the game to harass people.  On a happier mote, it is a good game, so good that o got it on my iPod and can't stop playing.  I hope this review is helpful.

B0090SI460|5.0|At this point we all know the \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" story.  Bachelor monster is at the top of his game but still feels empty inside; meets little girl of another species; suddenly finds fulfillment as a parent.  In 3-D it's no less affecting, and is the first 3-D movie I've seen this year that actually looks and feels like it belongs in 3-D.  I find this ironic, as many movies that were filmed specifically for 3-D look flat in comparison to the converted \\"Monsters, Inc.\\"<br /><br />Sully (John Goodman) is a traditional scarer, getting energy for the city of Monstropolis by scaring children.  The ethics of how this works never occurs to Sully (or anyone, really), as human children are considered terrifying, diseased beasts.  This of course makes it easier for the \\"monsters\\" to do their jobs.<br /><br />But in reality Boo is an inquisitive little girl who loves her \\"kitty\\" (that'd be Sully).  She is fearless of the various monsters, except for Randal (Steve Buscemi), a chameleon-like monster who has other plans for extracting screams from kids that's even less ethical than simply scaring them.<br /><br />Stumbling into this is Abbot-like sidekick Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a one-eyed butterball who is in love with his \\"shmoopsey\\" Celia (Jennifer Tilly).  Unlike Sully, he's moving on to a relationship -- with the possibility of raising a family -- and he balances the circumstances of their contact with the world of children against his future with his girlfriend.  This is heavy stuff for a show supposedly for kids.<br /><br />But that's the point.  \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is a show for the man-child in all of us, who secretly suspects he'd like to be a parent but isn't sure if he's up for it.  When faced with the possibility of Boo coming to harm, Sully tells Mike \\"none of that matters now.\\"<br /><br />It's hard to understand unless you're a parent.  But it's true.  Once you connect with a child, nothing else matters.  \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" isn't content to just entertain children, or stop at a happy ending.  It has a higher goal in mind, taking on the question of a civilized society and the ethical sacrifices it must make to be productive.  Sully eventually finds a way, but in doing so sacrifices the one thing he loves most.<br /><br />The last scene, with a monster coming out of the closet not to scare a child but to greet her, is one of the sweetest moments in CGI history.or stop at a happy ending.

0393343405|5.0|I could not put his book down.  Masterly written.  It covers thinking about religious beliefs from Epicurus to Lucretius up to the renaissance and the scholar who found an original copy of Lucretius book &#34;On The Nature of Things&#34; explaining why this was crucial in the development of thinking  about religious issues leading to the beliefs of modernists who believe the world was created by supernatural forces and like  the ancient Greek Epicurus All things living and nonliving materials are made of the same matter.  This book descirbes how some of the twenty percent in a recent survey in the United State do not claim to be identified with any religion.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Being that I had seen the movie already, I was anxious to read the book. As good as the movie is, the book is, of course, better because it can be more descriptive and expansive- enabling so much more emotion.
B005IQZB14|2.0|I was expecting an interesting narrative regarding the hike of the Pacific Coast Trail, instead it was mostly a morbid tale of a dysfunctional family and the loss of the author's mother at a young age. Not what I was looking for.

B009DQQE16|5.0|A lovely, somber, moody album from one of my favorite singers.  A major work, not some sort of footnote to a brilliant career.  If you enjoy Francoise Hardy, you cannot be disappointed by this disc.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I'm a Bruno fan, there's no denying it. I bump these tunes when I need a pick me up and they do the trick. I'm really happy with it, just like the last album you have to listen to it a few times before you get the true feel of the tunes and the album as a whole. As of the car ride home today, it was bumping and I was smiling.
B009EE6OGW|5.0|Easily the best monster movie of all time. From the sets and creature designed by H. R. Geiger to Ridley Scott's great direction it is a classic. I'll bet it will still scare people 50 years from now.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I'm addicted to this album, it's a great album and for the sale price it's a total steal. This one has been on at the office, in the car--everywhere. Nothing about the album is wrong, the only wrong thing is you haven't bought it yet, so go get it now!!
B009DT9ANW|5.0|I went to this concert in Memphis, and it was great. I've seen Frampton 4 times now (starting with the original FCA tour 35 years ago), and he never disappoints. The 2nd DVD in this set is as good in its own way as the the 1st (which is a song for song recreation of the original album). His son appears to be a talented singer in his own right and accompanies on 2 tracks. Audio and Video are excellent. Can you wear out a DVD? If it's possible, then I might do it on this one.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|This is an old classical race game by NEWTYPE K.K and I have to say it is pretty impressive then other game found on the android market. The game doesn't have many customization of cars and I belive it would be just to put the stats on the car such as max speed, acceleration, Handling and etc but overall it is a pretty good game. One of the features that I like is how there is alot of driving style and my favorite yet is having the driving wheel on left and the gas + brake on the right side. Another cool feature is how the game has differnt route were you could choose but it would be awsome if you can add place position such as 1st place,  2nd Place and etc. I hope in the future when you make racing games such as this to put my ideals in mind.
B009DJB9HC|2.0|Not that good . The two releases were much more focused . The tunes do very little for me -

B009YP9L7U|4.0|Fun and quick read.  Great characters and good story even if it was a bit predictable.  Read this book in a day, now I'm wishing I had more of it to read.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is a good read.  It's funny and dramatic.  Not too much sex, I am not an erotica reader, this has just enough to make it like real life.  I recommend this book.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I have to give a good review for any of the two and a half men sets. Otherwize, why would I be buying them in the fist place?
B001IF277K|1.0|This battery never made it through a single day's use on my wife's phone despite &#34;breaking it in&#34; with several charges. I would not recommernd this battery to anyone although I know the price is cheap compared to the OEM batteries sold by AT&T. I definitely don't know this for sure, but if I had to guess, I'd say these were rejects or recycled.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So intriguing! It is hard to take a break... you just want to see what happens next. I love how the story moves.
B009SQQRH2|4.0|Good family Christmas movie.  THe kids thoroughly enjoyed it.  They watched it multipe times.  Download worked very smoothly on my Roku XS, love Amazon Prime!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A 21st century Catcher and the Rye.  Beyond comparison to any other letter style book. Nostalgia sets in thinking about the wonders of the 90s
B000BNI99K|5.0|My husband wanted this set after he heard some of it on PBS (I think).  I finally decided to buy it for Christmas and found that I enjoyed it as much as he did.  The arrangements are great and throughout the years I didn't give much thought to Rod Stewart's vocals.  But he shines on these CDs and the songs really do suit him.  Who would have thought?
B000002KKS|5.0|This has to be some of rock 'n roll's best music. I had this album at 16.  The music was so powerful I was hooked, long before being exposed to Sabbath's well-known earlier lps, Paranoid and Master of Reality.  I had no knowledge of the song Fairies Wear Boots at that time, but now it is clear the vision of the band changed when Dio stepped in.<br />Two decades later, I've replaced that worn cassette tape with a cd; Ronnie James Dio's voice sounds even more incredible than I remembered it.  The lyrics of the songs are so inspiring I looked them up, online.  Dio seems to understand deeply the theme of living and loss. He expresses a vision that rings true at equal pace with the rest of the band.  His constant use of nature imagery, coupled with the passion of a mystical quest, tugs on the heart and soul of the listener. And although I will always love it, Fairires Wear Boots is hardly spiritually significant (except for the fact that it rocks). If the rest of the music Dio made with Sabbath or on his own is as good as what is on Heaven and Hell, or the<br />Rainbow cover tracks they play on the radio, then it must be a goldmine.<br /><br />Back to Heaven and Hell:  Neon Knights opens side one.  It speaks of the fight over good vs. evil as a never-ending battle--almost reminiscent of Rush's Tom<br />Sawyer (Moving Pictures album)-- but with Sabbath's visceral, gothic tone.  Children of the Sea follows; the guitar intro is alluring and sensitive.  Dio's voice sails above it, warning mankind to keep it real, learn from the mistakes of relying too heavily on resources other than our own power.<br />As one continues through the album, you really get the sense that Dio was a huge influence on the lyrics. (At 16, I didn't know about Dio having power struggles with Iommi, but one could see how it could happen.  We wanted Dio to push Iommi just enough to inspire his playing, not burn him out.  Eventually, Iommi took creative control of Black Sabbath.)<br />Personally, I have to like the lyrics of a song, they have to mean something to me emotionally or I don't want to listen to it.  Heaven and Hell has strong lyrics, such as the song Lonely is the Word.  Who can't relate to being at a low point in life?  Dio's voice is resounding; it soars from note to note.  No wonder Amazon.com rated this 4 1/2 stars.<br /> Listen to these lyrics from the title track:<br /> 'they tell you black is really white, the moon is just the sun at night, and when you walk through golden halls, you get to catch the gold that falls, it's heaven and hell...' (snarls Dio). These images are striking in their simplicity; the music, frenetic.  The dark realities of life we must face at times, or be aware of all the time...spiritual vigilance.  I think this song closes side one or opens side two, but who cares?  It all rocks.<br />My favorite song on Heaven and Hell is Die Young.  It is soul-shattering!  Remember the slogan, 'Just say no?' Turn that up to a fear so exhilarating that you want to go home, scrub the grime from your nails, put on your best outfit and take the first pew in church, save you become victim to Kurt Cobain's downfall.  Lyrics:<br />'gather the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all<br />your back's to the wall<br />chain the sun, and it tears away to face you<br />as you run, you run, you run...<br />so live for today, tomorrow never comes'<br />I am crazy about the rest of this cd, but why hear it from me when you can listen for yourself?to like the lyrics of a song, they have to mean something to me emotionally or I don't want to listen to it.

B007HACDLK|5.0|This was a very good book, but what do you expect from Vince? The book grabs your attention from the start. It is fast pasted with lots of action. I look forward to his next book that I will read.
1607066017|5.0|Saga is easily one of the best comic series that I have ever read.  A great blend of sci-fi and fantasy.  Anyone who loves Star Wars would love this.  Brian K. Vaughn at his best.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|No matter your affiliation, this is a must read. My son who hopes to be a neurosurgeon is reading it. I gave it out as Christmas gifts to special friends and family. A truly remarkable book with a truly remarkable message. A must read for everyone.
0783240236|5.0|I bought this DVD after seeing the HBO movie &#34;The Girl&#34; about Alfred Hitchcock's obsession with the star of this movie while he was making it. Once I watched it, I remembered how brilliant and ahead of his time Alfred Hitchcock really was!!!
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I agree with the subpar reviews, what a waste of two wonderful stars.  Meryl can hold a failed romantic view (think Bridges of Madison County). I love Tommy Lee, but he is basically an action Star.  Not a good match, their energy did not sync.  Meryl is Shakesperian quality.  Tommy is Good Old Boy fun, bad mismatch.  Both wonderful actors with the right story.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is loads of fun. I only wish it didn't have the energy thing. I want to keep playing and not have to wait for the energy to increase.
B0098460O4|5.0|Saw these two at the talent auditions. Fantastic pairing and great music for lovers of fine opera singing. A good addition to any cd collection.
6302794331|5.0|very nice movie i liked it a lot very good for children would buy again very good service very fast
B009LXEBD4|5.0|How can you not love Kelly Clarkson. I gave this as a gift to my husband so I'll get to listen too.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Fast paced, lots of action, violence was not too gory. It had an intelligent story though a bit tough to follow initially with frequent switches to scenes from the past. Great scenery too!
B0083F5J7S|5.0|Love Adam Lievien! I gave this as a gift to my husband, so I'll get to listen to it too.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This is an OK thing but seems to be pretty much a big gossip thing.  I do enjoy some of the games though.  But I honestly don't spend alot of time on it.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|We love Train! I gave this as a gift to my husband, so I'll get to listen to it too.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|This is an OK game just doesn't hold my interest that much, but the grandkids might enjoy it more than I do.They haven't had a chance to try it yet though.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry birds; I have all of the AB games on my kindle fire hd. The original is my favorite!
B00A757EFW|1.0|I downloaded this game thinking you can play it as much as you want or to a certain point but it stopped the game as I was on 2nd level telling me to buy full version or goto main menu, waste of my time
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Before I had a kindle I tried the kindle app on my Droid X2 and took to it like a fish to water. I find the android version especially good for reading in bed with the lights out. Like when your better half is sleeping. I switch the text to white, background to black, and the brightness on the lowest setting and all is good. The potential detraction of the small screen is well made up for by the light weight & ease of handling with the phone. I can easily one-hand it and switch positions without much fuss. With a little practice, I can even change pages with one hand, swiping with my thumb. I've also found this app convenient for waiting room time at doctors & dentist appointments.<br /><br />With the addition of whispersynch, I can switch between my kindle and android phone with ease. Each time, the current device offers to take me right to where I was reading on the other device and with a click, I'm right where I left off.  Heh, I can imagine a decade from now explaining to the youngsters about the days before whispersynch, much to their disbelief and bemusement. Cheers.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game. I play it every single day. My mom and my sister love it, too. Once you get into the game, you unlock this \\"multiplayer\\" level that is even more epic than the first. It is definitely worth the .99  or 1.99 you now pay for it.
B005LAII08|5.0|When I got this movie, I expected another Disney Princess flick.  But, it wasn't.  Not even close.  I actually liked that it took a whole different story line opposed to the typical princess movies that I grew up with.  I also appreciated that the characters were more... familial?  It wasn't about running off and living in some far-off palace with the handsome prince that swept her off her feet and made all her dreams of a better life come true.  It's hard to describe without giving away the plot.  But, a great movie.  I watch it all the time with my toddler.
030758836X|5.0|This is the first book I have ever given five stars! The twists are unpredictable and exciting. I really enjoyed this read.
B005AUWY90|3.0|I got this strictly for my son.  He absolutely loves it.  He's also a toddler.  But as far as expectation with regard to the first one, it kind of fell short.  It's not a Lightning McQueen movie.  It's a Mater movie.  It has most of the same actors from the forst Cars film, so that little bit was appreciated.  However, the story was just not what was expected.
B002L6O8AY|1.0|Want my money back.  Watched and forwarded after 5 min to see if there was a real movie in there.  Nope.  Maybe story line was good, I don't know because I didn't watch.
B000SEGCRS|5.0|I love these books they teach on a beginners level that I can use at my pace and get professional quality pictures without spending outrageous amounts of money.
0399160450|5.0|This was a Xmas gift for my husband.  He likes Tom Clancy.  Very hefty tome.  I intend to read this myself since I find Clancy's novels exciting and nail biting.  Recommend to Clancy fans. :-)
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I COUNLDN'T BELIEVE WHAT GREAT PICTURES THE KINDLE CAMERA  TAKES. I HAVE TAKEN A FEW AND THEY TURNED OUT GREAT. CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUTSIDE AND TRY TAKING PICTURES OUTDOOR'S.
8866130915|4.0|I love the design that Moleskine has with the weekly notebook, the extra page of notes for each week makes this planner much more useful and reliable for people like me who end up keeping notes everywhere. It also comes with these nifty stickers, which are adorable, which I think I'll use just to let the kid in me out for a little bit :)<br /><br />The one downside to this product, is the pricing to size ratio.. it seems to be a bit overpriced for being the size of a pocket book. I should have measured it myself before purchasing it, but after seeing the price I assumed it would be the size of a standard 'medium' sized planner. I will have to use it more to find out if it was entirely worth it. I am someone who can write (legibly) small, so it wouldn't be a huge issue, but for those of you how write large and a lot, I would invest in a larger version of this. I definitely suggest sticking with this type of planner, as it helps keep things much more organized and in one little book.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|I really like some of the songs. The others on the disc? Meh. Of course the best songs made it to radio.
B002ZHKZCO|5.0|Blu-ray and DVD on the same disc?  Had to try that!  This is a double-sided disc that has the Blu-ray on one side, flip it over and it will play on your DVD player.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is written very, very poorly. The lady cant write, she probably cant even send a good twit. The pornography is boring, the characters are not developed and the writing id awful. She can not tell a story, its like she is describing a blank wall.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I totally recommend this book! It was absolutely amazing. What a great storyline and romance. Sky's bravery is incredible as is Holder's.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Being from the D.C. area I know where many of the places would be. It all seemed believable in this book. Grisham did a great job with the details and until I googled it, I never realized there was no camp at Frostburg.<br />  One complaint is that at times the book seemed a bit wordy but otherwise it was perfect.<br />  This book would be great for someone living in the D.C. area, someone getting back into reading, or someone looking for a book with a major plot twist.
1594484805|1.0|The premise starts out as a Socialist manifesto by a self important individual who `knows more than you do about yourself.'  In the late chapters of his book his ideas have sound advice that are already intuitively obvious to successful managers but somehow terribly distorted out of fact.  Unfortunately, he has a total disconnect with the vast majority of the work force who is driven to work for money, in assignments they would rather not perform, and families they need to feed, in a jobless market.  Much of his `proof' is predestined information that can be disputed watching cashiers in Walmart, sewer workers following strict safety and regulatory rules, or others without the luxury of the position or societal elevation to have self-determining positions.  Everyone gets the same fair pay(there's a drive killer) - because weekly - everyone is told how well they do.  Kinda like having the Employee of the Month where all the employees know who's going to get it. Not because the employee is deserving, but because they know who hasn't had the 'praise' lately.  Mr. Pink needs to mix with the rest of the world.  Socialism hasn't worked anywhere else - and it won't work here - even with a kiss.  I need money to feed my family more than a peck on the cheek.  If my type A drive does not get me monetary gratification than I'll have to find another job.  Mr. Pink, the Third drive is gratification and if instead you're just going to smooze me and my colleagues, that generates animosity for every manager, supervisor or organization.
B0086700CM|1.0|Review:<br />Temple Run is a good game. I loved playing it for about an hour. But then I noticed that it starts out tooslow wafted you run for a while and you get faster.<br />Reccomendation:<br />After playing Temple Run and getting bored of it, I found another game that is pretty much the same thing as Temple Run. It is called Subway Suffers. Subway Suffers is more fun than Temple Run to me. If you like Temple Run, then you will really like Subway Surfers! I definitely reccomend for you to get the app Subway Suffers!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You: A Crossfire Novel: very similar to 50 Shades but I picked it up months after i completed 50 shades and then enjoyed it very much
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This kept me guessing, kept me engrossed, and keeps me in awe of Stephen King.  I loved it.  I became a fan when I first read The Shining.  It changed the way  I looked at reading.  You go,Mr. King.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel : I enjoyed this novel very much - similar to 50 Shades but enjoyable just the same
B005LAII1C|5.0|Loved watching this movie in the theaters, so I knew I would love watching it at home just as much!
0547884591|5.0|I accidentally on purpose opened all my Christmas presents early. Except one. It was heavy. It was from Amazon. I was excited (and slightly hungover). I opened it up, and there was The 4-Hour Chef. I sat down, forgot to make coffee, forgot to do anything. I read 92 pages, and i think it just changed my life. It is a system of learning, a meta-paradigm diagonal shift in consciousness. I immediately ordered The 4-Hour Body. In for a penny, in for a pound.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|great family movie...even the adults like it!!! it is hard to find a movie that both the children and adults enjoy and this is one!!!  good pick!!!
B007FJFDXS|5.0|finally found a game that can hold my attention for more than 10-15 mins. only thing cant get better than a D score. how do I get a better score?
B00APUQH0W|3.0|Characters were good ,some chuckle parts about growing old and stubborn.Overall not bad.Worth seeing if you like a baseball type movie.
0679722610|5.0|Red Harvest inspired a number of movies and is a classic story of one man versus an entire crooked town. It twists and turns like nobodies business! If you like hard boiled, if like noir, this is required reading.
B002Z7FWBI|4.0|My dad wanted all the Dirty Harry movies so i seen this and got it for him. It was very affordable and came very fast
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it is a fun game it passed time in a fun way. I have many friends that also have angry Birds and like playing it, they got me hooked
B00003CXC7|4.0|My dad was looking for this movie so I got it for him. It was cheap and was delievered fast

B004HW7JH4|5.0|there is no better show on television.  The only compaint I have is that I have a long wait for season 6.  DVD was in excellent condition
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|It had good music and some good points, but overall too cheesy for my taste. I grew up with all of these songs, but I am not into this display of the music. This is one that I will not be watching a second time.
B009JBZH54|5.0|he loves all he batman movies. we have had a movie night for the past 2 nights my son is also getting into these movies.. so glad i purchashed these.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I choose two stars because this movie was predictable and badly acted.  The only good thing was Channing Tatum's dancing.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Easy read for someone wanting to just relax with a book. Steady plot all throughout that stayed fresh and fun. Would recommend for an evening with popcorn and a blanket on the couch after a grueling week.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book absolutely consumes you as one of the readers has already mentioned in a review below.  From the first chapter of the sample I was sucked in and purchased the full book.. I ended up staying up all night reading it in less than 24 hours! It has a beautiful story line and catches you by surprise for sure.  The characters you just can't help but love them all.  This is my first ready by Colleen Hoover, but it certainly won't be my last.  Other books I have loved include Reason to Breathe, Barely Breathing, Thoughtless, Effortless, Fifty Shades, etc.  It is somewhat similar to Reason to Breathe and Barely Breathing, so if you loved it you'll love this too... Just READ IT ALREADY!!! :)
0446554995|2.0|I like most of the P & C books and always anticipate the next one. This one was all over the place. If they wanted to include 3 stories, they should have written them separately and in sequence. I ended up skipping Pendergast chapters to finish the car salesman story just to get it out of the way. The whole Nazi twin thing was kind of strange on two fronts - World War II Nazis and secret \\"created\\" twins. And - Helen knew about this and never squealed? Really? Maybe time to get a new editor.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Love the movie will be buying it for our collection of movies. Its not just for little girls our sons enjoyed it also.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I'll admit: the first few times I played with this app, I had no idea why it got 4 stars. It was just a bunch of dots that moved around and could change colors if you chose it to. I finally understood the appeal when I really tried to play with it, tracing my fingers  different shapes and at different speeds and changing the colors... it is breath taking and relaxing, especially on the kindle fire. Well done on the app, and very cool concept.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I love this game! om a huge super Mario bros fan and this is just like it. my 7 yr old daughter loves it too. we have downloaded it on our ipod, aneroid devices and kindle fire. love
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is really * really * really good!<br />Cant wait for next Angry Bird game.<br />awsome<br />good<br />great<br />cool<br />neat<br />fun
B00873GRU4|5.0|Love post-apocalyptic stories, and this is a good one.....nice to see a human face to the actual apocalypse for a change, rather than one made by aliens or vampres.....
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Small and efficient. Recommend this as it also has a serrated edge sharpener. Ceramic will keep your knife edge razor sharp with ease.
B000OY8NII|5.0|I was addicted to this show from the original episode.  Quirky genius characters in a picturesque little town. Hilarity ensues but this show is also so much more.  TV the whole family can enjoy.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Taken is a story about ever parents greatest fear.  IT makes you wish you had skills to do the same, but all that aside, it is also a good detective story with a time limit.  I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|This was a subtle movie that was beautiful in both the telling and the showing.  There is a great deal to be learned from the intertwining of two completely different cultures as they work together to meet a common goal.  I highly recommend this film.
1419705849|5.0|For my Grandson,he has read them all so as soon as he opened this book he started to read while he still had other presents to open :)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|From beginning to end, this book had me hooked. Charlie is a character who is incredibly easy to relate to. He's going through things in his life that everyone experiences to a degree. For me, it was about finding a place where you fit. Finding friends who will accept you for exactly who you are and what you believe. Friends that will challenge your thoughts and beliefs while still respecting the fact that what you feel isn't the same as what they feel. Charlie finds all of this in Sam and Patrick and their group of friends, but he also finds more. He finds love. Hope. Acceptance. But most importantly, he finds himself. My one regret about this book is that I didn't find it sooner. There were many times in my life that I could have used someone to relate to and Charlie so perfectly lends himself to that.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was really interested in seeing the movie but i was too late and I tend to line the books better so i thought i would give the book a chance before the movie comes out on on demand. I am SOO glad i got this book. It was soo good and was touching. It had a way of making the reader feel like the character. No matter who you are and what you've been through, you will be able to connect with Charlie.I loved this book, i definitely plan on reading again!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fantasy and possible reality all in one. An intriguing read. Cannot wait for more. Onward with the next exiting book.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Got this as an Amazon video for my kids & grandkids!  They loved it.  Well worth the price of what I paid!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Absolutely enchanting. I was captivated from the start, and wish I could attend Le Cirque des Reves myself, the author does a wonderful job transporting your senses to this magical place.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've read Slammed and Point of Retreat and I have to say that Hopeless ranks the same as being very powerful. I couldn't put the book down reading it in one day. Colleen Hoover is an amazing author who brings out so many emotions while reading her books.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|The plot of this book is a creative juxtaposition of two worlds: old bookstore clerks and cutting edge computer geeks. Throw in a bunch of quirky characters, some with a foot in each world, and the nefarious opposition and you've got a fun and engaging story!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|So of course she loves the color, and I love how it protects the Kindle, I ordered a graphite one for my grandson and may be ordering one for myself even though I dont really need it,
B001O5DR3W|5.0|I love this movie.  I know a lot of people say it's boring....I couldn't disagree more.  It's intense and the supporting cast is fantastic.  Bravo Leo!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Superb acting, great story, historically accurate, great sets.  Well worth the time. Would recommend highly to anyone who is tired of the gratuitous violence or endless sexual exploitation that is on most cable channels.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This movie is not very funny.....I would not recommend paying for it or watching it at all unless you love the family guy.
B006O6EOII|5.0|Gave this to a 10 year old neice for Christmas...she loved it! Very colorful doll with cute accessories.  Gave doll along with a scooter that matches the doll.  Cute!
B002O5M4SA|5.0|This movie is probably 1 or 2 in my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  Jean Reno as Leon and Natalie Portman as Matilda.  The dynamics of the characters in this movie are perfect.  I fell in love with it the very first time I saw it.
B009JBZH54|4.0|Noticed when watching The Dark Knight Rises (bluray), certain scenes full up my tv (16:9 ratio) and then other scenes the black letter box appears.  Its not real noticable but it is kinda annoying.  Rewatched a few scenes and it switches the same time, each time.  Any other's Blu-ray disc doing this?<br /><br />EDIT- Did a lil more research and I guess its normal. Annoying still..<br /><br />Dustin French says:<br /><br />All right, I hope this clears everything up:<br />The disc is not defective, and there is no way to \\"correct it\\" because it IS NOT a mistake. IMAX film is 70mm and is natively 1.85:1. The aspect ratio that the director wanted with his 35mm film was 2.35:1. Plus, IMAX film is clearer than regular. AND it's more expensive. Therefore, the director only purchased enough film for the action sequences that HE WANTED in the movie. It was his artistic choice in doing so. I saw the films in theatre, and they changed aspect ratios as well, so the blu-rays are doing their job in representing the films in the way that they were shot.<br /><br />Remember when DVDs first came out, and your parents complained that they could see \\"black bars\\" on the top and bottom of the screen; and you told them that it's completely normal because VHS tapes were all converted to Pan and Scan? This is the same deal: there's nothing wrong with it.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|As a child my sister and I grew up watching some old western movies and mini series.  This became a favorite of both of us.  It is 4 parts, but it is well worth the time to develop the story.
B005LAII62|4.0|Can't go wrong with this movie.  My kids love it and watch it over and over, i also get hooked when it's on.
B001KX50BK|4.0|I bought this as a Christmas Present and she absolutely loved it.  The quality I have heard is excellent.  Her favorite movie, so it was a big hit.
1401235417|5.0|Scott Snyder has written the Batman story that we have wanted since the Dark Knight Returns. This book actually puts you into the boots and cape of the Batman. You actually have to move this book to keep up with it. You'll find out what I mean while you<br />are reading it.
1401238580|4.0|I ordered this as a Christmas present for my 17 yr old son.  He absolutely loved it.  We are both huge fans of the movie, and wanted the graphic novel.  The mask as in other reviews is a little cheap, but that's okay.  We can live with it.
0810996596|5.0|Never mind any thing about Metallica. This book is just what the doctor ordered for the horror collector of a vintage age. Great photos and many items that were totally forgotten from the Monster kid era of the 60's.
B008A1TIOK|4.0|was satisfied with the purchase and the recepient of the gift was happy as well.  All went well with the purchase.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|This movie was GREAT!!! I loved the first two movies and this one DID NOT disappoint! I recommend this to everyone!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|if you have patience it is worth it.  its good,  could be better. Not sure how long I will play after a few times.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|A fresh and contemporary classical presentation of some of the hits you love, original compositions and Star Wars.  Classical music gold for the masses.
B005VTGB0S|1.0|I had lot of hopes on Amazon Basics and thought they would check the basics before putting Amazon label. How can they design a product for less than 10inches and expect to fit a 10.1&#34;. This did not fit into the folio on 4 sides. Tab fell down 4 times out of the folio. When you try to put it on the stand mode, the tab just slips out of the folio...<br /><br />Amazon, please sell quality products only, atleast do basic sanity check on the products you sell... I had returned it and brought a sleeve, it was wonderful.... Happy that I had a choice to return if I dont like it...Thanks to Amazon for hassle free return policy...
B0087DFIYA|4.0|I was very cautious about purchasing this one, however it was much better than I expected.  Gibson delivers a great performance.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|My favorite book of the series. A great way to wrap everything up. Once again (just like the 1st two books), I couldn't put it down & had finished it quite quickly.
B008I34ZFW|3.0|A very interesting premise, don't expect anything more than a comical and quirky look at the possibility of Nazi invaders from the moon.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|HD looks good on movies considering how old they are. The box set is a pretty nice collectors item. The original theatrical release & the director's/ special editions are included for each movie.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I'm not a Wes Anderson fan, in fact, I barely understand most of his movies but this one is different.  I recommend highly.  There's a reason why this is on so many 'best of' lists.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Once again it's a visual treat to watch the latest batman in HD. I'm happy with how they ended the trilogy despite not liking certain story elements (it's still a good movie). Ann Hathaway was surprisingly awesome as catwoman - quite unexpected & enjoyable.
0307592731|4.0|This is an amazing story of a woman overcoming loss and finding herself in the wilderness.  I did think her excessive grief was over the top, but the detailed story of her hike along the Pacific Coast Crest trail was amazing.  She was very brave.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Considering how old these are, they cleaned up the original three movies quite nicely. The box set is pretty cool with maps for each movie.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I bought this for my grandma this Christmas, considering she always loved shows like JAG and NCIS, but she doesn't have cable. She has been glued to this ever since she opened it! Haven't watched it myself, but a definite must if you know someone like my grandma!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I gave this set of CD's as a gift for christmas.  They havent been used yet but seem to be nice.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The game is easy to play and a challenge as you progress through the levels. The missiles just keep coming faster and faster.
030746363X|3.0|This program did not produce the desired results.  The weight loss was slow and the program too restrictive of foods I consider<br />to be nutritious.  It is definitely an unbalanced approach.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|This game is so annoying to download if it was Wedding dash I would probably try again yall should bring Wedding dash to amazon
B007N8RULO|4.0|Good game for when you are just sitting and waiting like in a doctors office. Can return later if you want.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Christmas music that soothes the soul.  We purchased two copies, one for ourselves and another for a gift after reading the positive reviews.  This collection does not disappoint, each song is a five star performance.  We would recommend this as a Christmas music &#34;must have&#34; for your collection.  Buy it now so you have a copy ready for next year's holiday season.
B00005Q66T|3.0|While it is a good CD music-wise and did come shrink wrapped, i am a little skeptical whether it was really brand new or not.  First indication was the packaging, the lables didn't look quite right.  When i took the plastic wrap off, i noticed the case was a little cracked in spots (ok, no big deal) but then i notices the case was not sealed with a label so i took it out and checked the CD itself.  It has some scratches on the back.  Seems to play ok, haven't had any issues with using it, but think it was either slightly used or maybe copied.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My grand daughter loves this movie.  When ordering this movie it arrived quickly and was here in time for Christmas.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|its a good brain game. I was playing when. my daughter came and took it away to play. I'm playing on my kindle fire and it hasn't had any problems yet....knock on wood. lol.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|this fit perfect since my i phone case was too thick to fit on my docking station without it. yea
B0000E1ALR|4.0|I didn't own any Springsteen and this collection is comprehensive, you get a good mix of his hits and his early work.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun!! It's equally addictive for kids as well as adults. I have it downloaded on all of my devices, so that I can access it easily. Thumbs up!!!!
014241493X|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It has mystery with a great human story factor as well. Good for teens and adults.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Hilarious movie! Not disappointed.... The whole series is hilarious! The kids cracked up throughout the movie! Loved the grandma! Funny!
0142410705|5.0|This was a great story for both teens and adults.  My daughter read it for school and I read it for pleasure! You feel like you know the characters as if they were your neighbors!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I wanted to read this book, as it was written by a medical professional.  It is NOT like all the other &#34;near death experience&#34; stories.  Because the author is a neurosurgeon, the story is very detailed and sometimes bogged down with medical terminology; but, this doesn't take away from the story itself.  If you want a light and entertaining read, you might want to read another book.  I, however, found it interesting and different from other books of the same subject.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If you like JOHN GRISHAM's books; you'll like this one.  I enjoy GRISHAM's plots and characters and he did not disappoint.  It is an interesting idea with some great twists and turns to make it more devious.  He seems to understand what the average citizen would expect from a die-hard lawyer.  Nice touch with just the right moves.
B009MCRHH6|2.0|Not my kind of game. . . . . . . . . . . .  ... . . .
1419705849|5.0|I was roaring with laughter as i read parts of this book and i can't remember when a book made me do that before. I think it<br />is probably even funnier than the first 6 books in the series. Seriously great stuff.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|It can be a little more difficult for younger kids.  My daughter is 7, but she still loves the game.
1406310948|5.0|Very good book and CD.  Received in a timely manner. It is recommended to all. good for Elementary Students to read it.<br />The Big size book is a highlight.  It can be seen by all students
034580404X|5.0|I had already read these books, and couldnt pass up the great deal, for my friends to be able to read
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is great!I couldn't stop reading!! I will definitely be reading this again. I need together next book. That cliffhanger at the end made me mad!!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|purchase for my son for christmas, he had already seen the lovie but loves to watch them over and over and couldnt beat the price
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is fun and you don't need wick so you can take it with you wherever whenever you want.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was the best yarn yet, lots of twists and turns, which Grisham can do well in all his novels, but The Racketeer seemed so much like the character was 'flying by the seat of his pants' and yet it turned out it was so well calculated.<br /><br />I found it too much fun.
B000P7V45S|4.0|I was very happy with the cd transition from the album,I still have.It is so melodic and quite satisfying to be certain.
0689877692|4.0|This book is OK but not nearly as intricate as some of the ones I've bought for my wife. But overall it's not bad.
B009439HEY|5.0|The must have for Genesis fans.Especially,Peter Gabriel era fans.Steve Hackett,has pulled off a wonderful tribute and accurate interpetation of all the tracks here.It is a who's who of prog musicians.Superb!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great camera bag.  Perfect size that holds not only camera, but has compartments that are excellent for additional lens, battery chargers, and miscellaneous other camera attachments.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I compare the weather forcast from AccuWeather with underground weather or my outside thermometer and it does not make sense.  Radio says 44 degrees, underground says 45 degrees, it feels cold and accuweather say 65 degrees.  Something is not quite right.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|The Game is graphically enchanting and the soundtrack is great too.<br />The puzzles get harder and sometimes it takes a few tries to get it right - but the challenge never getss too hard (or too easy) - Great game that I already liked playing on the PC - but with the touch interface on my CM9 Touchpad it adds a different level and is just fun allover again.
B005KP77WE|5.0|This is one of the very few remakes that turned out well.  It is a classic and will I see it staying in that category for years to come.
B008EL4YX6|2.0|Love the game-play and the puzzles - but got so annoyed at all the advertisements between each level that I stopped playing this game. I'd rather pay to not get the ads.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Amazing quality, very functional and useful.<br />Keeps your camera and accesories safe and clean.<br />Comfortable and easy to carry.<br />Perhaps, it would be nice to have the chance to put a lock to protect the camera when walking.
B009NTNHJU|4.0|2 Music CDs and 1 DVD.<br />The DVD is poorly put together, but it definitely gives you some insight behind the scenes of her music career! Gave me a minor headache because the cameraman was shaky.<br />Otherwise, the CD is not too bad, has a lot of her top hits.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's a fun game to play you can build your own city and country<br />With lots of people and money
B0058Z4NR8|2.0|This is basically a re-hash of William Easterly's The White Man's Burden.  Does it really bring anything more to the table?
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The game is really fun and responsive. Its a little addicting but a good time killer when you have to wait for something.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The controller came fast and easy. The batteries were a little low at first but nothing a good charge cant fix. After that i gave it a try out with my fiance. It ran great like it was right out of the factory
B004SIP7XK|2.0|We had been anxious to see this movie, but we hardly could get through it due to the harsh language and the black subject matter.  The DVD we received was defective as it stopped often during scenes.  We have sent the video back to the store.
B000050GQM|1.0|This DVD would not play on any of our DVD players because it's from region 2 (Europe). We went in to our settings on our computer and changed the country to Sweden so we could view the DVD.......ridiculous!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very entertaining ... light reading.  Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a feel good easy read that you can finish in a day or two !!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I got this app when it was promoted as AmazonMobile's Free App of the Day.<br /><br />I must say this app is very useful and easy to use. I use it to transfer files to/from my phone (no duh!) and it's rather easy and straightforward. It's a very handy app when my usb cable isn't around. It connects easily.<br /><br />I would buy it if I found that I used it frequently. I probably only use this 4-5 times a month, so very infrequently.<br /><br />Phone: Motorola Atrix4G<br />Android: Gingerbread 2.3.4
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I purchased this series to read on a 17 day cruise through the Panama Canal.  I was very happy that I did ... very entertaining and held my interest while I sat at the pool at sea ... what a way to enjoy a book !!!  Definitely recommend !!
B007SGM084|5.0|At first I decided to read these because everyone else was !!  Approx. 1/4 of the way into the book I was thinking that this series was not really for me.  But I decided to continue and then realized what all the hype was about !!  Suffice it to say, that if men would read these books at around age 17 ... books like Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus would never have to be written !!!
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|CUte app and easy to navigate and use. The quick windows help the user get to various parts of the application easily; def will recommend
0811821846|5.0|Great product with very funny recipies. It was a great Christmas present and has the funniest pictures inside and good recipies.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Very intense most of the season, very good effects. I didn't expect it to be as good as it turned out.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This is the perfect watch for anyone who wants inspiration to keep going on a run.  Something about the ability to track your run and see exactly what you did for how long, is very motivating. It is easy to use and download onto the computer.  My only complaint is that once you have it in timing mode for a run, the actual time is not visible on the watch face.  Having to click buttons is distracting when you are running and that is the only way to see the time.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Somewhat more drug out than season one, but still a good episode.  Not as much action, but when there is, as usual, it is pretty intense.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This was even better than the first season. It was a good read and the art rocks. I would definitely recommend to others
B000P0J09C|5.0|A little bit of everything in this movie, humor, action, some drama, good effects.  Great actors, very realistic.  Have watched it many times.
0064431789|1.0|Half the pages were upside down, which I didn't know until after I had already sent the book to my granddaughter in Peru. The postage to return it would be more than the book is worth. Very disappointing.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was a disappointing conclusion to what started off as a riveting trilogy.  still brilliantly written, but I didn't enjoy the final installment as mush as I did the first two. You still have to read it to see how the saga ends.
B008QE9XD2|2.0|It couldn't figure out if it was a campy comedy like the Addams Family or a drama like the old<br />TV show.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|If you like sick, warped psycho sex, you'll feel right at home here.  If you're even vaguely normal, this book will just make you ill. I didn't finish, I preferred to keep my food down, so I gave this demented, warped novel up.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Let you know once I read it, but it is great for book marks, etc. Stephen King can get a little long in the tooth, 800+ pages
B005C9YZIW|5.0|Great movie. Lots of action.<br /><br />Loved this Blu ray would highly recommend.<br /><br />Had this on VHS but 10 times better on blu-ray.
B004G6009K|5.0|We bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! It was a great price for the whole combo. So glad we bought it!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Would not buy for the younger crowd. Graphic but a lot of fun.<br /><br />Wish it was a little longer but overall a great game.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Only issue: I had to place the order twice. The 1st order was processed Dec 1st, however did not received a messge the order did not go through unitl Dec 22nd. Luckily the 2nd order was received prior to Christmas. My wife loves all 3 seasons. Wife enjoyed the DVD. DVD sent add extrras she loved. She hopes the show continues.
B009369Z8A|2.0|Exciting trailers, beautiful movie posters, high profile actors, authentic set design, gorgeous cinematography, but lack cohesive storyline.  Just a great big tease & false promises<br /><br />Boring continuous series of 'tit for tat' revenge between the bootleggers & local people who refused to follow to join their dirty deeds.<br /><br />Very cliche like what a newly graduated film student would make  Numerous bursts of 'excitment' & gunfights but meaningless & become mundane. Why?  Because it lacks logic.  Lack attention to details in the story development, lack the smarts & intellectual ways of telling a mundane event.<br /><br />The theme should broaden itself not just 2 guys don't like each other.  What's in it for them?  Ken Burns' documentary on the Prohibition was even more authentic, suspenseful than this movie.<br /><br />If it weren't for Shea LaBoef & other strong actors this movie would have gone straight to VHS.  A true B movie.  I watched for 1 hour & had no idea where this is going.  Too bad I already bought the BR.
B008J34466|5.0|I got the new Pink album because she is an awesome singer! The track &#34;Try&#34; is an awesome song and the main reason i got the cd. As for the dvds i got the 3rd Transformers movie because my son and i were certain that we had the 1st 2 dvds it turned out we didnt which we ordered and will be getting the 1st 2 soon. Amazon did a great job again getting the products to us! We got Transformers 3 from another great delivery company would use these people again.
B005IQZB14|2.0|Moral....you can do anything u want if you put your mind to it. Quest for inner strength . Am familiar with areas she hiked. Lucky she didn't end up dead.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had my doubts about this book, big time. Surprisingly it had much more content than I expected. It was a little over the top but I was intrigued.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|Nonfiction..very interesting.Good read for people interested in pre WWW II history. Especially what was going on in Asia. The mystery held my interest.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|I enjoyed the CD very much, I was not aware of the CD until I saw it on amazone.com. I can add this to my Whitney Houston collection.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very interesting and compelling book.  I couldn't put it down...now I want to see the movie, but I'm glad I read the book first.
B008Y7J1Y2|5.0|Realistic, relatable and romantic !!!! It's one of those rare films that has me laughing and crying all the way thru' !!
B00881VLCE|3.0|The puzzles are good but there are not enough free ones.  Also the bar that holds the pieces is dark.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Both of my grandkids love it. It is easy to use for them<br />I am even able to use it
B004CLYKLI|1.0|When I first started reading the book I told my husband that we really should have our son practice his piano more often. Shortly after seeing her relationship with her daughters...well, with everyone, I took that statement back. I won't go into the differences of parenting styles, we know what that's all about from seeing the discussions. I found the book to drone on and on and I kept waiting for something of relevance. By the end of the book all I saw was a woman who for some reason just wanted to brag about how crazy she was. Nothing actually happened in the story and I was left with nothing else to say to my husband then \\"we are doing OK with our kids\\" and \\"what a waste of time\\". I really don't recommend this book and really only read it because it was there. I hate to give a bad review, but I always read reviews (except this time) and am glad when I can pass up one to move on to a book I'd enjoy.
B00004Z400|5.0|This album, to me, stands out not just as their landmark, but probably their greatest effort to date. Everything else since then, while really good, doesn't compare to the beautiful complexity of this gem. Anyone into 90s alternative and, especially, any deftones fan, needs to own this album. Definitely a must have.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like soltiare. Always have. This is a nice game nice and traditional. Not complicated at all. I am always playing it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|WOW!  This camera back pack is nicer than i thought. There is alot of room for all my stuff and then some. I am really impressed with the quality ans workmanship that went into making this AmazonBasics camera back pack. Well worth every penny spent. The pack looks like a regular back pack so It DOESN'T draw attention and say,&#34; HEY LOOK AT ME, IM FULL OF CAMERA GOODIES !&#34;  It seems very sturdy and will hold up for years to come. The only thing i may do to it is spray it down with waterproofing! Other than that its a TOP NOTCH camera back pack for the price.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Exactly that. All his characters in everything he's penned have a very strong sense of self. Don't get me wrong I love an 80's action hero style flick as much as the next guy, but occasionally I want well written character interaction. It still maintained the superhero element while showing exactly how human these superhumans are. The boxset is amazing too. It has a 3D Blu-Ray, Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital Copy along with a code that unlocks an Avengers Comic on Comixology's website as well as the Official Soundtrack and some extra artwork for download on your PC. Can't argue for $30 about how much content is packed in.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is on of the best games on the app store hell IT'S the best game on the app store and if it's hard for you to find diamonds and other minerals then download the inv pro app it's only $1!
B001TH7GT6|5.0|I needed these to run Component cables from the Receiver to my TV to allow my Wii to run it's sound through the surround sound. They worked great save for the fact that the cables are a little stiff. Now, unfortunately, they just sit in a box since I no long have Wii, but have since upgraded to a Wii U which runs on HDMI.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is a wonderful game Me and My sister love this game. This company should make more games like I this.
B0013ND36G|3.0|So I ordered this because apparently there are 2 different transfers of the Blu-Ray and I wanted the best looking one. That part wasn't the issue, I received the correct transfer, however, the box art had dual languages on it. English and Spanish. It's not a huge deal, but the product was not described as such anywhere on the page. Plus it looks a little out of place on my shelf.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Good for looking up words. Has a wide variety of words to look up. It's truly a great dictionary. People will love it.
B009K45Y62|5.0|This box set was a steal. At the time they had the trilogy for $30, the movie by itself for $20 or this giftset for $35. As a normal Blu-Ray\DVD\Digital Copy combo pack runs $30-35 at Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, this was a steal. I didn't need the other 2 as I already had both of those on Blu-Ray. Plus I'm a bit of a collector of special editions so this one was perfect. Not a big fan of how the disks are stacked on top of each other inside the little case, but I've found that's the new standard for special versions like this. Blu-Rays are pretty resilient so I'm not too concerned.
B00723NWJE|1.0|We have listened to Norah for years - but this CD did not get a replay by either my husband or myself.  Listen to it if you want to become terribly depressed.  If not - skip it.
B0053FANS6|4.0|The first and second movies are great. The 3rd one failed to impress. Brendan Fraiser is great, but the fact that Rachel Weisz was replaced in the 3rd one was very disappointing. This boxset is pretty nice. I was a little disappointed with the packaging though as this particular set is a single case with a double sided spindle for all 3 movies to fit on. I had seen at Best Buy a version with 3 super slim cases that was about the same total thickness as this one, which I would have preferred. Other than the 3rd movie being a straight to dvd style flick and the difference in case it's a great set that looks amazing on Blu-Ray.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Yet another rich and fun recording by Mr.Buble.  Great for our holiday collection - and for all ages to enjoy.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|There is so much extra content packed on this disk. The super extended director's cut was actually pretty cool, however, it messes with official canon as the other movies in the series could never have happened if that ended occurred.
B004G600A4|4.0|This is a fun movie - we purchased after our 4 year old saw the movie at a relative's house.  Fun, light, no real message here.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|Couldn't even get passed the opening because the movie kept skipping and or freezing!  I hate purchasing something and then you can't even watch it!
B00ADIT8U2|1.0|This game was poorly written and planned out.  There was too much pointless backtracking- you would enterone area, find one object and then go back several areas to use the object, only to pick up a new object and backtrack all over again.  It could have been organized much better.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|It was an afternoon read.  I learned a lot about the French involvement with the Germans and was very saddened.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I've purchased this game multiple times because it truly is a work of art. The music is fantastic and the game mechanics are elegant and addicting. I cannot recommend a better \\"casual puzzle\\" game out there on the market. This is a must-have in your library of standby games. It gets incredibly challenging towards the end, but the variety of levels builds and builds upon the techniques you learn as your progress.
B001FB55HQ|3.0|Terminator Salvation(released May/09)is a mixed bag of goodies starring Christian Bale as John Connor,Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright,Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese,Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Serena Kogan,Michael Ironside as General Ashdown and others.It is uneven and piecemeal,with two simultaneous plots which must ultimately mate,but the film takes its sweet time doing so.<br />The story finds us first in 2003 with the death of an inmate,Worthington,who has signed his body over to Cyberdine systems rep Carter,for experimentation.Fast forward to 2013 and Bale has survived a terrible attack and has returned to a submarine commanded by Ironside,who is the resistance leader.The resistance plans to launch an all out attack on the Skynet facilities and have  uncovered a plot to kill all the resistance leaders,including a civilian by the name of Kyle Reese.Everyone but John is unaware that Reese is his real father and that he must survive.<br />Meanwhile Worthington has come to L.A. and he is saved from a machine attack by Reese,whose importance he is yet to know.They travel on and find the pilot of a downed resistance aircraft.Along the way back to the resistance HQ,Worthington steps on a land mine.At HQ the medical people discover Worthington is really a Cyborg.Bale doesn't trust him,of course,and jails him.Worthington escapes,but while on the run from Connor and company,Worthington saves Connor's life.He vows to help Bale rescue Reese from the Skynet facility.<br />They arrive at Skynet and Worthington interfaces with the computer programming,learning about his roots and why he was created.They find Reese,but Bale has to do battle with a T-100 Terminator,with the face of Ahh-nold.This over they all escape,the facility is destroyed,but Bale is critically injured.The film ends as Worthington gives up his heart to Bale,so Connor may carrying on the battle.<br />If the reconciliation of the two diverging plots had been made clearer as the film went on,and it hadn't taken the majority of the film to finally come together,this film would have been much better than it was.As it is it is a slow progression,jumping constantly from one story to the other.Other than the actual voice of Linda Hamilton/Sarah Connor's voice from the earlier Terminator movies,and a likeness of Ahh-nold on a T-1 late in the movie,there is little else to connect to the first three films,actor wise.The major characters like Connor and Reese are totally different actors.And unless the film could have made up for this disconnect by having a better edited and intelligent script(which it didn't),then it was doomed to fail.It was good to see actor Michael Ironside on board as the hard nosed resistance commander.If you need a real tight butted,ball busting superior,who is either normal,psycho,or somewhere in between,Mr.Ironside's is the guy to call.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.there are no extras.<br />All in all a big disappointment.Two parallel plots which take most of the film to come together,leaves one bored as all get out and scratching ones head.Considering the talent on deck,this film should have been a winner,instead of a mediocre S/FX laden picture.he majority of the film to finally come together,this film would have been much better than it was.As it is it is a slow progression,jumping constantly from one story to the other.Other than the actual voice of Linda Hamilton/Sarah Connor's voice from the earlier Terminator movies,and a likeness of Ahh-nold on a T-1 late in the movie,there is little else to connect to the first three films,actor wise.The major characters like Connor and Reese are totally different actors.And unless the film could have made up for this disconnect by having a better edited and intelligent script(which it didn't),then it was doomed to fail.It was good to see actor Michael Ironside on board as the hard nosed resistance commander.If you need a real tight butted,ball busting superior,who is either normal,psycho,or somewhere in between,Mr.Ironside's is the guy to call.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.there are no extras.<br />All in all a big disappointment.Two parallel plots which take most of the film to come together,leaves one bored as all get out and scratching ones head.Considering the talent on deck,this film should have been a winner,instead of a mediocre S/FX laden picture.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|I'll make this very simple. I love the movies but the DVDs (as apposed to Blu-Ray) have exactly one extra - The Journey Of Bruce Wayne featurette. That's it. There is NOTHING beyond that on any disc: no director's commentary, no behind the scenes, nothing. How can there not be any commentary?!?! It doesn't even take up any space! The real drag is that as far as I can tell there is no place to get any of the myriad extras except by getting the Blu-Ray discs. That sucks.<br /><br />It also comes with a booklet with is selections of pictures from the book The Art and Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy... Meh.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is an excellent app.  It works well and easy to use.  The format was well thought out.  I have not found any features I would like to have that were not there. ,
145210655X|4.0|Every father has to deal with most (if not all) of the situations in this touching and lovingly made book. While each one page cartoon is drawn fairly simply, there is some great attention to detail. Weather in the toy store, at the zoo, or riding in Darth's Tie Fighter, there are some father-son interactions that transcend which side of a binding, metaphysical, ubiquitous power you are on. Jeffery Brown is clearly a father and Star Wars fan.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|We watched this with my teenage kids and we all were laughing out loud! Good humor, a little warped, but well worth the watch!
B004LWZW7E|5.0|I love this movie. It is original. I really wasn't expecting much out of this DVD but I was shocked that it was so good.I would recommend this product to others.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is challenging as well as fun. I highly recommend it for people who have taken any biology or microbiology courses.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game combines elements of the earlier versions into one, with some added features! I love this game and can't get enough of it!
B005HSL626|3.0|Im Not Very Good At This Game So Im Giving It Three Stars the Adds Can Get Annoying After A While But Guess What One Simple Click And Boom The Adds Gone So Hahahahah Stop Complaing It Only Shows A Add When You Lose But Again One Simple Click And Its Gone If You Dont Like This Game Then Uninstalle This Game Easy As That No One Cares About You Oppinions About The Adds So STOP Complaining
0618154043|5.0|This book is filled with background information on Middle Earth - may help you understand why Peter Jackson put certain things into his Hobbit movie.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I like this game because it makes me not give up and keep trying.  I was getting frustrated with all the ads on the free game and trying to shut them off and it wouldn't so I splurged for the ad free version.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this  book is so filled with confused emotion and suspense which makes it impossible to put down! will will have to read the last 2 books and even then will want more!!!!!
0739378341|5.0|Another good book for John Grisham.  How he gets into the psych of &#34;black&#34; men, I will never know.  Racketeer captured my interest from page one.  The ending was totally unexpected.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I wanted to be able to take a picture or two of something else besides who is looking at the screen!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It will only show the most recent 10 posts on the timeline and will not let you scroll down to see more. Formatting is also not correct. I look at Facebook through the web app now.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire All the options are just a bonus! The ease of this app is great and anyone can play!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I LOVE this game. It is terribly addicting. I wish there were mini games associated with the levels you unlock after gaining the puzzle pieces.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this game and the options to play many different versions of the game! The game is very easy to navigate!
B006TJXZ30|3.0|Doesn't show all of your messages. Takes time to page through them. Tends to only show unread messages. Not very user friendly.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Was necessary, maybe should be included with the product, BUT not sure why they don't! Nook includes all the pieces for their product?!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|My kids all love to play this game, they are between ages 8-11. It's neat how they share the app, and take turns taking care of their business.
B00006I53S|3.0|This lens has a very useful focal range, is fairly compact, has a decent minimum focus distance, and has image stabilization. Everything you would want in a good walk-around lens, basically. Unfortunately it just didn't sing for me. I wanted it to be better than it is... I guess it's because I'm spoiled by owning some L glass and great third-party lenses like the [[ASIN:B007SNP02K Tamron SP 24-70mm Di VC USD Canon Mount AFA007C-700]].<br /><br />I do a lot of product photography, and in the small space that is my home studio I'm constantly running up against the minimum focus distance on the Canon 70-200mm lenses. The Tamron 24-70mm works well enough, but sometimes 70m isn't quite long enough to get the perspective that I'm after. I can switch to prime lenses, such as the Canon 100mm macro, however I thought that this lens would be a good all-around compromise, since it covers more focal range on the long end and focuses pretty close. Not quite close enough, I'm afraid. It has a little section at the end labeled \\"macro\\", but that's a joke. The closest focusing distance is approximately 19.2 inches (50cm) and the Max. magnification is a mere 0.19x. My Tamron 24-70mm, on the other hand, focuses as close as 15 inches (38cm) and has a Max. magnification ratio of 0.2x even though it is not labeled \\"macro\\". The Canon 28-135mm didn't gain me any ground in the area of close focus while giving up a considerable amount of image quality.<br /><br />Speaking of image quality, it is only moderately good and when you're used to shooting with high quality glass it's a disappointment. The image stabilization is an earlier generation and so it's not as effective as today's IS. I just couldn't see myself accepting the drop in quality to gain the additional focal range. You can see that this lens doesn't really hold its value as the resale price for used is considerably less than the price for new. It's currently selling used for only about 60% of the new cost. Compare this to most Llenses which hold their resale value much better, usually demanding 90% or more of the new price. On the upside, you can easily pick one of these up for around $250 here or on the 'bay and try it out if you like with minimal risk.<br /><br />Released in 1998, this is now showing its age. This, or something like it, would be a great candidate for a Canon remake. I hope they consider it because there are not any other full frame lenses to choose from that cover this particular range. There is an EF-S lens with a very similar field of view range, the [[ASIN:B002NEGTTM Canon EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM UD Wide Angle Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras]] which is an exceptionally good lens. If you're shooting on a crop body, definitely skip this lens and get that one. If you're shooting full frame, save up for the Tamron 24-70mm or the Canon 24-105mm f/4.<br /><br />Happy Shooting!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Hmmm it does just great, no complaints,, what else to say???  Not really it does what I want so go out and down load
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was a slow but good book. Relaxing and at sometimes unsettling. But I liked it.  Would recommend it to others
B0079R8IYW|5.0|I bought the Kindle for my daughter. She let a one year old hold it and when she dropped it, no worries.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Solid flick, good plot line that brings things full circle but the movie runs on the long side.  It didn't feel as much fun to watch as the other Batman movies... but I still enjoyed it and would watch it again.  As long as your expectations are reasonable going in, you won't be disappointed.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This feedback is from the person I bought it for &#34;Love this show, could not stop watching it!&#34;<br /><br />Only heard good things from alot of people.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I must say that this book had me engrossed from start to end.I read it through in one day.<br /><br />The text explores several themes including childhood friendship, adult friendship, love (parent to child, chikd to parent , parent to parent),trust and of course suicude.<br /><br />The issue of suicide is one that is close to my heart as we have had a few such cases at the school that i teach. Each time it happened it shook us teachers and students to the core mainly due to the unanswered question  'why'?.  The truth is that there is always something going on but the teen may not relate the issue(s) to anyone-not even to someone s/he trusts. This features quite prominently in this text and I could totally identify with Chris' frustration. I found myself shouting at Em 'jus tell him already! 'but...clearly it's not as easy to share certain things as we think.<br /><br />I won't say anymore so as not to spoil it for someone who has not read it. I truly enjoyed this book and would recommend it without hesitation.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|love this cd.  the vocals are great and i love the lyrics too.  she is creative and beautiful and i have enjoyed listening.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|every time I use this, it always says &quot; connectivity lost please check your network settings&quot; and I do but it still doesnt work
B001PB3RU8|5.0|i love this cd...i listen to it all of the time and don't know why i didn't order it sooner.
B009GIPDQS|3.0|I found this book disappointing for the price.  It was a good holiday read, but that is about it.  The way the loose ends were tied up at the ending was a stretch of the imagination.  I found this a disappointing book from Grisham.  I really like his books and expected more.  It seemed as this was rushed through to hit the shelves by Christmas.  Sorry to say that, but when the Kindle version is more expensive than the hardcover, I expected to have my socks rocked off.
B0041OJ0Y8|4.0|I like it, would give it 5 stars if it was a solid album, but only a few songs get play time.
B002V092M4|3.0|This was a good book.  However it was very slow to start and at times I was wondering what the point was.  I battled through it because it came so highly recommended.  It's ok.
B0049IWQJW|5.0|My son loves this film almost as much as CARS 2!! Loads of action, great story and moral, most specifically lots of CARS for our son.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is awesome and it is very addicting its my favorite game I have ever played I have already made 8 worlds and it has only been two days I play it morning and night
B000F7CMQ8|5.0|Clark Gable, Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly make your heart pound.<br />It is such a wonderfully romantic story and very insightful as to how people handle their hormones.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|Husband and I loved this.  Very funny. Rebel Wilson takes the cake.  We watched it twice in one day.  Winner
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I like the case and stand except I feel the groove on the back should be deeper.  It keeps folding up as I am using it.[[ASIN:B005HSG3VK Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Case Cover by Marware, Pink]]
0756407125|5.0|My 19 year old son in college said this is the best fantasy series he has ever read.  He has purchased this book as a gift for other friends that enjoy this genre.  The next book in the series is eagerly anticipated.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I tried watching this series, and I thought it was a bit hokey, so I decided to try and read the books before I revisited the show. I am a huge Harry Potter fan, so I was hoping to get caught up in these books as well. At first I was hesitant because the language Martin uses is very..advanced? But I got use to it after awhile. My next struggle was keeping all the characters straight! I ended up googling a character guide and having to use it a couple times.
B00364K6YW|5.0|If you are a Colin Firth fan, this is the movie for you!  Do yourself a favour and<br />watch it over and over again!
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was on sale so I decided to give it a try. It turned out to be a really great story! I was consumed from the first few pages.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Would recommend for the entire family.  Will Ferrell always does a great job.  Kids, grandkids and my husband and I both enjoyed it.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|my wife and I use this to share grocery lists and other notes. it is also helpful in remembering wines we discover and for storing recipes.

B005KR6OBM|5.0|Not sure how to write 17 words about the DVD's.  If you like the show you will like the DVDs.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Love the songs in this movie!  Meryl, Christine and the other gal are great!  All the players really developed their characters. The scenery is breathtaking, especially the view from the path leading up to the church.
B005HSL626|3.0|Every thing fine, received on time, communcation was good. * * * * * * * * * * *
B004LWZWBU|2.0|I thought that this would be a move for us.  We enjoy both birding and Steve Martin movies but when it ended, my wife and I just looked at each other and said, &#34;that was a disappointment&#34;.  The movie has little more than three guys running all around the country trying too hard in their own way to be funny when the situation often does not fit or support their effort.  This is not a move that will be saved in our collection of moves.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Gr8

B005LAJ16I|1.0|Claire Danes is great, but the series lacks any sense of excitement. None of the characters is sympathetic. I was hoping they would all die so this would end. More time is spent cutting hair than developing any sort of plausible plot line. To compare this to 24 is an insult to a wonderful show that, even at its worst, far surpassed the occasional moments of interest in this rubbish. The nudity does not spoil the show, it merely provides a break from the tedium. Save your money. No-one I know enjoyed this.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Every thing fine, received on time, communcation was good. * * * * * * * * * * *
B0042J6VUS|4.0|It's a good tripod but it really makes me nervous it's going to break with my case on the phone, I never want to remove my case.  The plastic of the tripod feels a little cheap, also.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Animated or not this movie gives an open view of the struggle to fit your parents ideal of you and your ideal of yourself. Beautiful work, great story. If you get upset by \\"nudity\\" then your too immature to be watching this. The \\"nude\\" scenes are of 3 little boys from behind and one of the suitor's father mooning the other fathers, yet the viewer never actually sees it. Great movie that doesn't focus on a teen having to marry for marriage's sake to some guy who \\"wins\\" her. This movie shows girls that there is nothing wrong with being strong in theirselves and we could definitely use more of that.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Running on a Google Nexus 7. I don't usually remember to leave reviews but this app works so well I had to make an exception. Easy to set up and easy to use although the Youtube search interface is not especially intuitive. Since my Nexus is wifi-only, I can download several videos, concerts, TV shows, product reviews while I am at home and watch them whenever and wherever I want, regardless of whether I have wifi. I can't speak to how well it works on other platforms but this app has increased my enjoyment level of owning a tablet by a large margin. The downloads are fast and if I remember to load a few videos ahead of time, I can spend my lunch break watching anything on YouTube. I haven't had any popup ads or anything that seemed sketchy in the least. I try (and usually delete) lots of apps but this one is a definite keeper, at least for me.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The hunger games,was a good book, but it took a while to get into. I hope the next one is better.

B000VYX8PE|3.0|I put a middle rating as I have not read this yet. I put it on my Kindle so I will have it to read when I am on the go. The first few pages that I have read are good.

0307891372|5.0|This guide helps you do everything you would need to do in the game. It covers every quest and does everything it says it does. If you like something in your hand rather than looking it up on the computer every second than you should get this.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham generally wrights convincing novels. His last few novels has been less than what has become expected from him, including &#34;The Racketeer&#34;. Hopefully, John  will get back to his standard that he set when he first started writing novels.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|My fiance plays this game, and he seems to really like it. I would recommend it to Adults who like to play these type of games.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed the last of this  series. The ending was great. As with the other two the sex  was very much  overdone.  I found myself skipping over a lot of it to get back to the story.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|My fiance downloaded this app and I've never used it, so I'm not sure if it's good or not? Sorry.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|I gave this book 5 out of five stars because I like to personal experience that the doctor that wrote this book had gone through. I suffer from postconcussion syndrome and this book has given me inspiration and hope.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I was never a big sci-fi guy, but Dune blew me away.  The story is great-- if you're not into sci-fi don't worry-- this book is a classic revenge story that happens to be set in the future.  There are no robots or cliche star trek moments here.  Super original, super great, a super book,<br /><br />My favorite ever.<br /><br />If you die without reading this book you are making a colossal mistake.
B009GED3HS|2.0|A snooze-fest of contrived stories, almost none of the fun humor that made up the show in previous seasons, rehashed plot-lines galore, and bad jokes that just seem like they're trying too hard. They really need to just introduce the eponymous Mother ASAP and end this train wreck because it's best days are long behind it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was obsoletely amazing. I thought I was in love with the 50 shades series, but this one takes the prize. The ending Will have you at the edge of your seat and wanting more. I can't wait for entwined in you.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This is more than just the silly zombie apocalypse I originally assumed - it takes a couple episodes, but there is a lot of human interest and good character development

B0012QCZ54|5.0|If you love the first one, you will also enjoy the 2nd one - all the Step Ups are great if you enjoy dance movies.  It was a gift to myself and I love it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I've read the book, and I really didn't know how they were going to be able to stretch it to movie length, but they did a great job of it.  This is a really cute story with an important environmental message.  My granddaughter and I both giggled all the way through it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Definitely lives up to all the hype... like it and would recommend to anyone.  No problems with seller or delivery at all.

B00AKKTDJY|5.0|The game keeps you busy and every level is a new cooking experience. Playfirst has so many games that will keep you looking for the next challenge.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first, I didn't think I would like this book.  But, the more I read it, the better it became.  I couldn't wait to read more and discover more about Katniss and her plight.  EXCELLENT BOOK!!!
B003TNM2K6|3.0|Let's make some popcorn, turn down the lights, and watch a scary monster movie! ....That was the original idea of this story....A 50's style \\"saturday night creature feature\\".... Stephen King said so himself....However, somewhere along the way, the makers of this film went way off into socio-political metaphor and a depressing representation of the human condition...The result is a completely humorless,cautionary tale. This is probably the area where I part company with those who love this film. I was expecting it to be enjoyable as well as scary. Still worth a look, though. It has some great monsters & creepy crawlies (in spite of it's \\"lack of fun\\").
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|A little simplistic and easy .....okay a lot simplistic and easy but cute. Great game to play with a young kid, the child will enjoy the games and you can enjoy the humorous storyline and characters.
B0063IH60K|1.0|You had a pop-up ad between each game, and they aren't always real clear on how to delete them, I didn't need online dating. Oh mercy, hahaha
0670026182|5.0|So happy with this cookbook, the stunning photos bring the recipes to life. The recipes are home-cooking at it's best, have only tried a few so far but am looking forward to cooking/baking my way through the book.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is a lot of fun to play and I could play it for hours! If you enjoy playing mahjong, you will really enjoy the different modes this game has to offer!
B0079R8IYW|4.0|Does the job.  You still need a separate screen protector, though.<br /><br />Also, the &#34;stand&#34; is only good for one angle, which isn't ideal for putting it on the counter while I'm cooking.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I started reading these books I couldn't stop. I just wanted to keep reading...I had to know what wad going to happen. Very good books.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app makes it easier for me to read. I have the bright light behind the text and don't have to get paper cuts from turning pages when I use it. It still can't take the place of a good ol' paperback book -- the smell of the pages, the feel of the paper, etc. but it's a nice alternative when on the go!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is great. I find myself playing this game for hours, but one bad thing is I<br />can't seem to connect to multiplayer.
B00797MB0O|4.0|I had to write a review, where I usually do not, because there are so many low scores for this movie, and after reading the reviews it seems a lot of people are missing the point. There are many great movies out there where the star character isn't someone to be admired or even liked. The point is not to like her. And the point is also not to have a happy ending. If you are looking for some sunshine and rainbows, then watch a Disney movie. This is supposed to be dark. It is supposed to be a close look at a damaged individual. If it makes you uncomfortable, it intended to. I'm just amazed so many people give this bad marks because it didn't \\"make them feel good.\\" I think those people had the wrong expectations, which isn't the movie's fault. If you take it for what it is, a sad look into the life of someone struggling to accept reality, it is a fairly good movie. The actors all did a superb job. And while I did not like Theron's character, I for one could not help but feel sorry for her, because she was so unstable and clearly had some mental issues. This is not a character that just wasn't nice. Many of you are missing that she also was mentally ill- an alcoholic, someone whose anxiety caused her to pull out her hair, depressed- Rather than abhor someone for having these traits, I'm surprised more people didn't feel a tinge of pity for her. The only way she could cope with her mental state was to revert to high school and over-compensate by believing that she was better than everyone else. My point is, those of you who rate this low because it wasn't happy clearly missed the point of this movie and should just watch something like \\"Air Bud\\" if you want to go away happy. The idea behind this movie is to make you think about mental stability, about the people out there some of us all know who peaked in high school and stayed stuck. Also, I felt at least at the end, although she wasn't \\"cured\\" (which would have been unbelievable without professional help, especially so quickly), she at least vowed to put high school behind her. The only way her mental state allowed her to do that was by believing she was still better than everyone else. I think the sister telling her she was wonderful was also just to show that Theron was so eager to believe it was true and that her mental stability wasn't superficial. Also, that there are people out there who will always idolize those in high school undeserving. And there are still those from high school who still wish they could impress the \\"jocks\\" and \\"popular crowd.\\" Even years later, so the sister character made complete sense, as also someone optimistically sad. Please, if you enjoy movies for more than just the happy take-away effect, give this one a shot. I think many of the 1 and 2 star reviews are from people that are a little too \\"in the clouds\\" and superficial for a movie that is dark and makes you think a bit.quickly), she at least vowed to put high school behind her.

B003K16P3M|5.0|I rated this book because it deserved it. 5 stars.<br /><br />1. A sense of adventure.<br />2. A well planned plot.<br />3. A splendid story.<br />4. Well thought out characters.<br />5. A story you won't forget.<br /><br />I would give it to anyone and everyone because it is a must read for EVERYONE!
B002BWP49C|5.0|I think this piece of the movie series was as expected and well done following the story line.  The way that Bella was represented here was excellent - it really showed her deterioration realistically. I am excited to see the next one to finish this storyline!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best trilogy I have read, couldn't get enough! Christian grey is every woman's dream :) it's a must read !
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Started out really good and I was enjoying it a lot, but it slowed down and Seemed to have a lot if filler and an abrupt ending.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I luv this book! Some ppl thnk it's kinda geeky 2 read the dictionary 4 fun an I guess it is but it's still 1 of my fave hobbies!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|From the acting, to the story, to the drama, everything about this show is amazing. It is definitely the best show on ABC family!
0316223239|5.0|So many of the reviewers have already given the basic premise of this book.  The best I can say is that as a sense of dread accompanied my reaching the middle of the book, so too was the compunction to save that part for the daytime hours.  This book haunted my dreams until I continued reading.  The author is a master of imagination.  Can't wait to read her other offerings.
B002KREVCO|2.0|there are very few songs on these CD's that even sound like the AC/DC I remember from the past. I knew they had had 3 lead singers but there re alot of songs that are ver obscure.
0374275637|5.0|Engaging.. mind opener! It deepens your understanding of what you take as truth and why it might be wrong! Must read!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I purchased this for my husband he loves it and has watched it several times and even loaned it to a friend to watch.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Who knew Tink had a twin sister?  I think Disney is missing out by not releasing the Tinkerbell movies to the big screen. This one would have been particularly charming in a real theatre, as opposed to on my Kindle. It was watched several times during the rental period.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A classic! And the narration from Anne Hathaway was great too,  I might add. You should go read it now!!!
B008IZYWXU|5.0|There will never be another Freddy, so when something new comes along, it is a &#34;Need to have&#34;.  The remaster sounds great!

0312323867|5.0|I loved this book because it was a continuation of Something Borrowed, which really left you hanging.  At the very end of the movie, there was a sign &#34;to be continued&#34; which confused and didn't explain.  This book continues the story and makes it more believable!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|As far as games on phones/tablets go - I like things that are quick, easy to understand and play. Fun, cute game
B008GXHOFW|5.0|you need to get this game! I love it! this game does not have any problems with it not even one!! you really need to buy it! it is awesome!!!!!(:
B009NTNHJU|5.0|This is a really awesome album from start to finish.  My fave track is Hell Yeah.  This album has not left my car CD player since it got in there! You may want to get the clean/edited version though (I bought both).  This also includes a DVD and the original Roman Reloaded album plus the credits pamphlet folds out into a big pic of Nicki. If you don't have this album you NEED it!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was given \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" as a gift from my husband.  Once I started reading it I wasn't able to put it down.

B009K45Y62|5.0|This set is amazing, it also has great detail on the cowl. The picture quality on the dark knight rises is fantastic
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The fact that it was in letter form was very unique.  I have never read a book like that but it still read like a novel.  The book was very personable and was easy to get caught in the emotion due to the fact that everyone has strange feelings during high school due to many changes. Good read!
B00499QUK2|5.0|I've been in love with this series since my friend first showed it to me. Being able to find both seasons for this cheap was awesome!
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I have several of Gotyes albums and this one is right up there among my favorites. His use of sythesizers is excellent.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A great summary of the history of the period. The characters are really well developed and believable, even over a long time frame. This should be required reading for young people because it delivers important history in an engaging, entertaining way.
B000V6OMMU|5.0|This is an excellent soundtrack. It is very relaxing with just the right amount of pep. If you enjoy Celtic music then this is definately worth buying.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|my child is only 3 years old. he saw a<br /> porn add.he went to me and said'is the porn?  I looked at it. I had to lie and say no.  when he was sleeping I deleted it and got the add free version. kids play this people.  no wonder its free.thank God there is add free for angry birds.
B006O6F932|5.0|My girls love the Monster High dolls. The playset was the perfect compliment to the dolls and they love putting it up. The best part is that it folds down into a very compact carry case.
030759565X|5.0|About the book:<br />Deb's photography is gorgeous, the typesetting is incredible, and the book is well organized. As a long-time reader of Deb's blog, I really love the stories she uses to introduce each recipe, and I was thrilled to find that there was relatively little overlap between the stories I remember reading in her posts and the stories I read in this cookbook.<br /><br />A couple of reviewers have commented that the recipes are often split over multiple pages. This is true, but as someone who usually reads recipes first, then gets all her ingredients together, I've found that it doesn't bother me or really make cooking difficult for me personally. I know that's an approach/personal preference thing.<br /><br />About the recipes:<br />AMAZING DELICIOUS WONDERFUL.<br /><br />That said, this cookbook is not:<br />-A cookbook designed for a beginning, unadventurous cook.<br />-A cookbook designed for someone who is carb, fat, or time conscious.<br /><br />If you don't fall into one of those camps, though, this is a great cookbook whether you plan to stick to the recipes relatively strictly or use it as an inspiration for your own ideas and flavor combinations. It's got a little of everything (from breakfast to main dishes to sinful sweets). Deb also explains the tools she uses in her own (tiny) kitchen, and those stories at the beginning are often really helpful to inspire me to cook when I really just want to go get Chipotle instead. :]
B00555X8OA|3.0|Very insightful revelations into the workings of the brain. Extremely complex brain circuitry requires a complex explanation. The writing of it was a real challenge to my average intelligence. There were times I wanted to give up on it, yet I persited. A hard work slog but well worth worth the effort.<br /><br />Brad Jones<br />Scottsdale, AZ

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!! I play it all the time!!!! my siblings and I play and see who can get the highest score. they love it too!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good read.  Already read and saw movie but fantastic anyways.  Anyone who reads should read it seriously dude for real.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not bad. Kinda like the Empire Strikes back for teens. Can't wait till the film comes out! Love Joe h
B005HSL626|4.0|Great for coordination training for a toddler. My son and I love this game, and the sounds it makes. Thank you
B008DKBPTO|5.0|I love this case. It protects and looks pretty. It is hard to find a pretty case that is purple. Most are so plain and boring. But this is pretty and very durable.
0385523394|4.0|We read this for my bookclub and everyone was really happy with this book.  We all really just found it to be a fascinating topic and really enjoyed the story behind it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest. Its my new obsession. I use to save things that I liked onto my desktop. but everytime the desktop cached a virus my folders would get erased after the desktop got fixed. now I get on PINTEREST either on KINDLE FIRE or my SMART PHONE.
B0025KVLRO|4.0|My mom loves the Beatles. and she's been collecting them. So I got her this cd. and she loves it. the songs are great and all that. But the only reason why I'm giving it a 4 is because of the case. it sucks. me and my mom hate the new style of case. it slips in into the case. We both wish it would've been packaged better. But other then that you should get it. Or at least see if you can get it with a better case
B0073LWEXK|5.0|WOW! this game really challenges you and makes u think. Don't want to put it down at all. With help, the young kids can do this too.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Have watched this show from the beginning. It is a very good show. Hope it is on for many years to come.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|This product does the job you'd expect. No surprises. Fits my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; just fine, easy to remove when necessary. I also like the way it looks. Not much more to say, it's pretty self-explanatory.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I read this as a child and loved being reunited with it! Great story, and has  a lot of details they could not fit in the movie.
1591396190|5.0|I put this book down as having changed my life, opened my mind and has created an amazing series of new ideas that I'm implementing into my business and Sharing with so many others. I have referred to this book in numerous presentations and would recommend you buy a copy, buy a highlighter and be prepared for an amazing read, oh and grab audio set too!!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Great hidden objects game. Lots of levels. Great to play if you have to wait somewhere. Best of all its free.
B00ARAO720|2.0|I tried to like this movie because I was very bored and wanted to kill an hour. Well I did. Based on the reviews I really expected something with a bit more... well everything. The acting was painful and uneven. Some of my favorite actors seemed to have a hard time connecting. The action scenes seemed repetitive and awkward. The 6th grade educational video style soundtrack did not help. I just had a hard time buying it... the whole thing. If you enjoy bad movies from the late 80's you may be in luck.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Great songs bring backs great memories<br /><br />Highly recommend<br /><br />I love this cd I play it over and over. Great price
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Can't wait to enjoy all four Indiana Jones movies! I've seen them all, but there's nothing like high adventure at your fingertips.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I was very pleased with this book, it had a lot of pleasant surprises and a very interesting plot. Highly recommended as I will continue reading the series.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|One of the best concerts I've ever seen. I like that there's a separate CD, since it's the tracks I really want to listen to.
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|I Recommend to any Crow Movie Lover! It is a great add to any collection. I give this 5 stars! *****
B007EE4XKI|4.0|The book is an interesting story line that follows the original Next Generation TV series. This is the first book I have read with the Next Generation characters. David Mack is a good Star Trek writer, I read his Vanguard series before starting this one. I will probably get the next book in the series.
B004P7CMDM|5.0|I Recommend to any Crow Movie Lover! It is a great add to any collection. I give this 5 stars! *****
1433502410|5.0|Very Good Bible.  Gave to my daughter and she really likes it.  Would recommend to others as well.  Thank you.
B000QGEB12|5.0|Good movie, its different.<br />The subtitles aren't the same as the English they are speaking, its the same train of thought. No big deal but I thought worth mentioning. When they move their mouth when talking its not simultaneous with the words they are supposed to be speaking, which is a lot like the old Bruce Lee 1970's movies.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|In my eyes, one of the better Bosch-novels to come out lately. Although sometimes a bit forced and somewhat typical in its jumping between on / off the clock issues, Connelly still delivers a fairly well paced and intriguing story without too many unelievables.
B0015AARJI|2.0|this seems to be a ligitec controler put into a ps3 controler. its lights and runs all over the place on the screen. it sucks dont buy from these guys.
0316069434|4.0|It took me a bit to get into this book. Then, maybe between pages 50 and 70 it just started to come together and became \\"I can't put this down.\\"  I thought the novel was really superb with suspense, tragedy, a very complex plot, and typical Connelly dry humor mixed with pathos.  I felt his relationship with his daughter made for some very moments in the book and as usual when he deals with Bosch's relationships there was definitive foreshadowing as to what might happen to him personally in the next book.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|The case looks nice enough.  I bought the wrong size for my kindle.  Read all details before you buy your case.  Don't make the same mistake that I did.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|If you're a fan of the tv show &#34;Castle&#34;, I think you will really enjoy reading this series.  It's fun imagining the tv characters acting out these books.  It's like art imitating art.  Will be nice when someone takes responsibility for being the ghost writer.
B0095VPBFY|4.0|Used this in a sub $500 build and it's a fantastic deal for the price.  FarCry II on medium settings with perfectly playable framerates!  Should I try Crysis now?  Asus MB autotuned it to 4300Mhz without a problem.<br /><br />Couldn't give it the full 5 stars because of the minimal stock HSF and the low CPU performance, but I'd still recommend this processor to my friends.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I saw the original TOTAL RECALL as a kid so I was eager to check out the remake. I went into it with the most open of minds and with no attachment to the original. If you're the kind've person that likes great special effects and that trumps a good solid story this movie might be for you. Unfortunately I'm not one of those guys. I really enjoy a good story and a well thought out script. With so much \\"action\\" and s*** blowing up every 5 seconds, I gotta be honest: the movie was kind've boring (at least to me).<br /><br />To keep this short: here are my pros and cons of the film.:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Interesting concept (a tunnel through the Earth, from England all the way through the Earth's core to Australia)<br /><br />- Special effects are amazing. Really out of this world (which is why I gave the film 2 stars)<br /><br />(I'm not trying to be a cock, there really aren't any other pros)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Generic acting. I don't think it's Colin Farrell or Jessica Biel's fault. In fact, I each of their performances in the movie were truthful. However the story and the characters they were given to play were GENERIC AT BEST, BORING AT WORST.<br /><br />- Slow story. It just dragged on and on.<br /><br />- S***ty Writing. There was nothing in this movie that stood out. I was completely uninteristed and uninvolved in the characters success or failure. If anything the special effects were more of a distraction towards an already boring movie.<br /><br />I would pass on this one.
B00366BBLC|2.0|From the information seen on this video, HECK, this I already knew. Keep your money please!!!!  Look it up on the internet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First time reader. Couldn't put it down. Looking forward to the next one. Buying it soon. Then will be watching the movie.
B007JMW46U|5.0|I like a good mystery and the way he figures out what has happened. He is a very observant man.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Just what I expected from Barbra Streisand of her album Release Me. I bought it for a present for my wife and she was delighted.
B007THA4FI|4.0|As an ardent fan of this author, I was eager to read this obvious divergence in her literary genre. I was pleased to enjoy her depth of character development and plot, stimulating and captivating in an odd and rather disturbing manner. Clearly this seemed the intention of the author, executed with mastery and literary skill. Her skill in character portrayal is obvious yet again, creating a likeable and identifiable character out of a very ordinary and even boring protagonist.<br /><br />Plot is exceptional, foreshadowing winnowed to an art form rarely seen in modern fiction, but clearly one of Ms. Rowling's greatest talents as a writer. The almost insidious protagonist in the beginning is the hero every reader wants to succeed by the end of this accomplished novel. High points.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|We can't get enough of this movie.  The graphics and sound effects are terrific.  Unique take on the old fairy tale!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|AWESOME,I love it. Bravo Suzanne Collins. I could not stop reading this book,it was so amazingly awesome,The Hunger  Games is.

0307341577|3.0|I've now read three Gillian Flynn novels, Gone Girl, Sharp Objects, and Dark Places. Dark Places is my least favorite of the three, but I'm not a rabid fan of any. What I do love is her writing, the way she describes the characters and the scenes, and the way the characters always feel very real--if repellant--when she puts you inside their head.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after reading these three books, I've been consistently disappointed by her endings. It's like she doesn't know how to end them, or she wants to make sure the endings are implausible enough that the reader won't figure it out. I'd rather have an ending I can figure out than an ending that makes me think, \\"Huh...that doesn't seem quite...is that really...?\\"<br /><br />The ending of Dark Places has been the worst for me, bordering on silly. The payoff for the hours I spend immersed in these characters and this plot is just so inadequate.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|A great baseball book that's different than any others I have read. I grew up an A s fan and it was great to get an inside look at how the club works.
1423140605|5.0|Each book in this series gets better and better. Not sure how the next one can out do this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read. I laughed and I cried. I highly recommended it to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like playing this game. It is addicting though. It was easy to download. Although I don't care for all the advertisments that pop up.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|This DVD is a must have for people who enjoy cop shows. The story lines and acting are very good. Michael Chiklis and crew keep you entertained over the 7seasons.
B008476HBM|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is just one of those books that I love to read over and over again. It is one of the best romance books ever.  In fact, my favorite romance book, Jane Eyre is written by the same author.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I've finally gotten a chance to read these and I'm so glad I finally did. I can't wait to read the rest of the series. I've also read both books in the Infernal Devices and I would highly recommend both series!
0805047905|5.0|What a classic children's story! We had the regular copy, but couldn't let our granddaughter play with it because it is so easy for a toddler to tear a book. We bought this board book so that she could have her own &#34;bim bor&#34; book to &#34;read.&#34; Durable and easily cleaned. It will last through many grandchildren.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Especially relatable to for high school students this is an extraordinary book that offers a lot of the same situations us high school students go through on a daily basis with decisions of facing drugs, alcohol, and the common stresses that come with being a teenager. All in all a great book
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I was fairly disappointed while reading this book. I wasn't as engrossed as I usually am with his previous books.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this  book so much .. I love it so much I read it in two days ..thank you Stephen for writing this book
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I really liked the dialogues, but it is relly easy to read and light. It could have been a stronger story, but still i found it entertaining.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I totally agree 100 percent after buying  tablet the camera app should be included. The app its self works great tho. But Amazon that is just low really low.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|We purchased this movie in addition to the one we already have - this was for my 1 year old grandson for his house,  who just loves some of the parts and color
B008476HBM|3.0|A classic, this book is a great pleasure to myself and I would recommend it to anyone fond of literature and able to understand higher level reading. Besides, who doesn't love the classics?
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great game easy to win an challenging as well<br /><br />You should try it<br /><br />If you are trying to learn or get better
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I give this book 5 stars.  The detail was wonderful and it felt alive.  I can't wait to read rest.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|The light is bright and the sensor works even in pitch darkness.  It stays on only long enough to walk through so I expect batteries will last.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|I really like the resident evil series of movies. I was disappointed. There was nothing that drove the story of these series of films. All the other films left a to be continued feeling. This film did not .
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I had to listen to the album once through before it grew on me. It has a different soul from \\" Doo Wops...\\". Once I knew what to expect though it was great
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I gave this book to my Dad, an 89 year old member of the Greatest Generation, Navy veteran (White Plains/Battle of Samar), Air Force flight engineer (B-17, C-97 and C-133) and Delaware Air Guard member (Viet Nam).  \\"A fantastic story....tears came to my eyes.\\"  That was his reaction after reading \\"A Higher Call\\" in one sitting.  He added that it was one of the best he had read -- high praise because he reads constantly, having just completed the 1,000 page third installment of the Churchill biography, Last Lion.  He's also quite familiar with author Adam Makos and brother Bryan, having read and saved their early publication, Ghost Wings.<br /><br />More than the story, which in itself is well told, \\"A Higher Call\\" is a very satisfying read:  Well structured and well written.  Even richer is the context Makos weaves throughout the book:  Detailed, thoughtful, complete and very pertinent.  It provides a special insight into the life and experience of pilots on both sides, especially the German side.<br /><br />Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard: Please buy the rights and make the movie!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Human frailty, human strength, divine intervention, faith, family, humor, tough love, consequences, redemption, forgiveness, and a compelling story line... this movie has it all.  A couple of the actors are a little stiff, and the story requires Kleenex at a couple of points, but through it all, you see the hand of God in the lives of the characters and it all comes together in a phenomenal way.  Everyone needs to see this, several times a year, in fact.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|We have never watched this show on TV.  We only watch the new episodes when we buy the dvd for them!  Great show!  Glad they renewed for a 9th season!!!
1419705849|4.0|It was on time it got here really fast and he loved getting it for Christmas.I would but another book.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|In this updated version there wasn't as much emphasis on the Resistance group as in the original film. It really just felt like Houser was fighting one man, Cohagan.  It didn't come across as Houser fighting for the Resistance against a man who had led to the opression of half a society of people.  It came across as Houser trying to stop a current invasion from happening.<br /><br />Personally it was OK....clearly the special effects were awesome but some of the acting left a bit to be desired.  The characters and their relationships were not explored at all.....there was much more to these folks int he first movie.<br /><br />I'll stick with Arnold....
B005LAIHZY|5.0|The story was great.  It was moral and clean.  The animation was very well done and I loved her hair!
B004U52VPS|4.0|I bought this for my 6-year old. It was easy to set up and play and both my daughters enjoyed it. The parts are plastic, so they are fairly easy to knock over if you can hit them with a bird, that is the challenge. Its not as easy to shoot as I thought. We just modified the game to include more tries and just had fun seeing what we could knock over from the challenge cards with which birds. Cute, fun, age appropriate.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|Its freaking Facebook! Everyone uses this. Why does it only load the first ten stories? Something is not right here.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I qualify this by saying I have not read the books, which in my experience are always better than any movie produced out of them....that said, I had heard so much about this, I wanted to see it. I liked it. It definitely made you think while keeping you involved with the characters. Good job.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|It is an amazing book that I got into after watching the series an  I love it!<br />Must-read book :)
0425252868|5.0|My college roommates father was a B-17 bombardier and recently spoke of his thirty-five missions over Germany. As Lt. Collins told us his story, you could see in his eyes that the memories of 1943 were not a distant memory but were unfolding right in front of us. \\"A Higher Call\\" will take the reader back to December 20, 1943 and you will begin a journey on an emotional roller coaster as you realize the obscene nature of war.  These me are justly called the \\"Greatest Generation\\" for fighting to protect the freedoms of this great country. What Makos does for the first time is tell the story of \\"the enemy\\" and how this honorable and courageous man(Lt. Franz Stigler)brought some semblance of humanity in not shooting down a defenselessness B-17 piloted by Lt. Charles Brown and the remaining crew.  This is an amazing story that has been waiting to be told and Makos does an outstanding job in drawing the reader into the deserts of North Africa and the skies over Europe in the greatest conflict in human history.<br />  It is not often that a story about both the \\"good guys\\" and the \\"bad guys\\" will have you laughing but will bring tears to your eyes as these two men meet and tell their stories to their families and the families of the surviving crew.  This book is a must read very much like the \\"Band of Brothers\\" where you get to know the men involved but cannot wait to get to the end of the story but are saddened the you have finished the book.  I read this publication in three days as I could not put it down!!!
B005K17RU0|2.0|The description says it updates every 15 minutes. My experience is 45 minutes to an hour. I live on the Gulf coast and even 15 minutes can be long when watching approaching severe storms on radar.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH<br /><br />As corny as it may seem, charlie reminded me of myself growing up and my way of thinking... always helps to read a book with a character you can relate too. I would definitely consider myself a wallflower!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Games were not really that good or fun. Maybe for someone younger but not adult. I had it for about a week before deleting it.
B001LM1456|5.0|This was a requested Christmas gift and I was happy to find it on your website and it appears to be of highest quality.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Was looking for something to play on my Kindle Fire. Was sick of card games and I am not an angry birds type of person. This game is challenging and fun. I have now gotten my boyfriend and his daughter hooked on it.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This was a requested Christmas gift and I was happy to find it on your website and it appears to be of highest quality.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Got this for the long car rides at work. Its fun because more than 1 person can play. Was a bit confused with some of the rules but I love it.
B0034G4P80|5.0|This was a requested Christmas gift and I was happy to find it on your website and it appears to be of highest quality.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|A friend told that I HAD to read this book and that it would blow me away. Well she was right. I got the first 5 chapters for free to see if I would like it. And OMG I could not stop reading it. I never wanted to put the book down. I can't wait for the sequel to come out soon.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|You don't have to agree with the religion of this book to enjoy the read, but I may give you a little cause for thought.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I picked this album up for $1.99 and really didn't have any expectations going into it.  Sure, I had heard the single \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" but that was about it.  Overall, this is an amazing album. I especially liked the following tracks:  22 and I Knew You Were Trouble.  The album is fun - even though it's about break-ups and relationships.  Well worth the $1.99. I would have even purchased it at full price.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004SRNH10|2.0|I tried and tried and it wouldn't download to my android tablet.  Called Amazon and they said they had other complaints of the same thing.
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|Took a chance and picked this up for $1.99 over Christmas.  I was really looking forward to Unapologetic by Rihanna. Unfortunately, after hearing Diamonds, you pretty much get a lot of B-side tracks. The only other good single was the Ginuwine-inspired track, Jump.<br /><br />I don't feel too bad, because the $1.99 pretty much covered the price of the two songs. If you're expecting classic Rihanna though, this definitely isn't it.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great movies all on Blu-Ray. My dad loved it he is a huge fan of the rocky movies. All around awesome.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle is clearly an outstanding singer and I highly recommend this album.  I especially enjoyed the selection of her songs on this album and the musical accompanament.
1449410243|5.0|worth the price to have a good time laughing. i'd buy it again or maybe give it as a present
141659521X|5.0|With this book, Vince Flynn returns to the snap, crackle, pop--the sizzle--of old that makes Mitch Rapp one of American publishing's greaest counterterrorism heroes.<br /><br />  Who is Mitch Rapp?  How is he back?  Consider these words, his own, from early in the book:<br /><br />  \\"I'm the guy they call when the sh.t hits the fan.  I'm the one they bring in to get results because they know I don't play by the rules...\\"<br /><br />  Also from the book, from one of the soon-to-be bad guys: \\"Rapp is a person capable of extreme violence, with little concerrn for his own motality and an absolute disregard for the political and legal issues that men and women in uniform hd to wrestle with...\\"<br /><br />  In other words, Mitch Rapp is a badass...but he's our badass and this is Vince Flynnn at his absolute finest.  The snap, crackle, pop--the sizzle--is back.<br /><br />  And what is this book about?  Suffice it to say, some bad guys, even some supposed of our own good guys, are up to some bad, bad stuff. Then, like the calvary of old, Mitch Rapp arrives in the nick of time...but always in the nick of time.<br /><br />  Mitch Rapp at his bold and daring best.  It's good to have him back.  No, it's great to have him back.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Received the Dark Night Trilogy the day after release and have watched it with family and friends about 10 times now.  Not to mention 3 times in the movie theater.  Awesome deal, and great movie collection.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Most everything I have ordered, I have enjoyed. Pac-Man has been a game that I have enjoyed for years. This on the web is as much fun as the old ones. All my book have been by Evans are exceptionable - love them all!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The news feed doesn't allow you to see all the posts, only a few. You miss out on a lot of posts. Viewing facebook in the browser is much better.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a page tuner. Keeps you on the edge of you seat. Couldn't put it down! Exciting and powerful.
B00AHXDECG|4.0|I really like Bruno's style and voice, but wish there would have been more &#34;If I Knew&#34; and less &#34;Gorilla&#34;. I enjoy the album but find myself skipping too may cuts to get to the really good stuff. Doo Wops was better.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|While this movie is very kid friendly and there are some good one-liners it doesn't have the magic of the original. Of course this was not to say that it wasn't any good. The interaction of scrat and his nut is always a crowd pleaser.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|so much fun it is one of my favorite games next to &quot; cut the rope&quot; because it is made by the same people. it has no problems ever and trust me it is amazingly awesome!!!!!!!!
B009POCG2C|5.0|Another classic and great movie with Clint Eastwood. Great acting. Great screen play. Great plot. Great suspense. But, most of all it is a unique and interesting story that brings to mind stresses with life in various forms.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Came in early and is everything they say it is! This was a Christmas present for a friend and they were so excited when getting it
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My dauther loves this game, she constantly explaining how to combine the dragons and how to take care of them...
1599218011|5.0|Kris Carr's Crazy Sexy Diet and Crazy Sexy Kitchen have quite literally changed my life for the better. She gave me permission to explore a somewhat taboo lifestyle with curiosity and bold & daring courage only to discover that this is what my body was crying out for. Her super sassy writing style felt like I was being enlightened by my best girlfriends. She's a superstar and her work is ground-breaking. I'd buy it again if only my friends and I didn't already have it!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Received this right on time. Very happy with service, I would recommend this to everyone. I will use them again in the future.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This movie is like a claymation version of &#34; Oh Brother Where art Thou&#34;.  The adventure is captivating and the characters are hilarious.
B009NF54ZE|1.0|Too much dialog and not enough action.  I got bored clicking through the dialog so I wound up deleting it.
B007XHWROK|5.0|Geeze if i had known what a great gift I would have done more.  Are you selling any tickets for his concert? lol
0307591549|4.0|a book that really requires strapping on the thinkinking cap. somethings old,some new but a new presentation & approach. for this alone causes dynamic reframing & a new approach to many things,such as management
B00004RF98|5.0|Probably THE best movie musical of all time!  Can't go wrong with great music, fantastic vocals and the best tap dancer of all time!
1609611543|5.0|good information.I have lots of allergys to wheat. Found it to be very informative and helpful in guiding me on eating. Thanks, Nancy Langhorst
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I bought this watch for my husband and he just loves it. It's his first mechanical watch and he loves being able to see it working through the clear back cover. He says it feels as though it's alive lol. It came in an attractive Seiko box with the tags still attached, which I wasn't really expecting at this price point to be honest. The Lume paint on the hands is nice and bright. He did replace the band with a brown leather band which looks fantastic against the tan face of the watch. It seems to be keeping excellent time so far. In my opinion these Seiko 5's can't be beat for the money. For about the cost of a Timex I was able to get him a well made, Seiko mechanical watch. What more can I really say?
B00881VLCE|5.0|I always liked doing puzzles, but with two kids, I don't have time to do them.  They also like to play with the pieces.  Now, I can do a puzzle as I have time and save it for later if I need to.
0446554995|4.0|I have read every book in the series featuring the Pendergast character.  I have like some, loved others and been so-so on a few.  I have always been entertained, and confounded, the only difference..... the degree to which I enjoyed them.  This book falls somewhere in the middle.<br />Pendergast finds that the wife he thought dead for years is alive.  If that was not shocking enough, she dies quite cruelly very soon after he finds her.<br /><br />This brings on a Pendergast we have never seen before, one truly lost and alone.  This very vulnerable Pendergast is not one I particularly enjoyed.  It was an all too human reaction, but Pendergast was always something more.....more contained, a superior intellect.  He fell short of this when he faced his own despair and helplessness.  The writers took him to a new place, a more .....for lack of a better word \\"human\\" place.<br /><br />The story evolves from this and as usual, nothing is as it seems and Pendergast is once more caught up in a mystery involving a serial killer with possible familial ties, and an old obscene experiment.  Pendergast is tested to his limits both physical and mental.<br /><br />There are also a couple of secondary storylines woven through the book.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book; I am glad I bought it, and have a great hope the series will continue.  So why no rave review?  First, I am not sure I liked the vulnerable, capable of human frailties Pendergast, even if he did get himself well in hand.  Second, the other stories woven into the book seemed a little odd to me, though they did wrap up a few things from previous books.<br /><br />I got a chuckle at the end of the book from the character Proctor.  I think he summed up the Pendergast family pretty well, with my own thoughts as to his place in it.<br /><br />It is a standalone book, but I think you will enjoy it much more if you read Fever Dream and Cold Vengeance first as recommended.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I could not put the book down. Adam Brown struggled through addiction, failure & significant injuries to become a SEAL & serve his country &God. Ultimately, his family paid a huge sacrifice. His family can be assured that he is rejoicing in heaven, no doubt doing important work in a place where evil does not exist, along with David Carter. I was so pleased & surprised to see David mentioned at the end of this book. He was a hero as well. I knew him and am friends with his mother.  Thanks to the author for getting this incredible story right.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|At first, I found the book to be amusing but nothing I couldn't put down.  However, around the middle of the book, I began to laugh out loud and couldn't wait to finish it.  Perfect ending to a great book!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Well you really don't need my opinion on this, it is a long but awesome one...just watch the movie already!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I bought this book when it first came out, before all of the hype.  I loved it and finished it in just a few days (which is quite a feat for me considering I have four children).  Would recommend it for anyone.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I am not much on remakes, but I thought this was a good rendition of the originial.  I would recommend seeing this movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love all of the books in the Hunger Games Trilogy, but this is my favorite.  When the announcement was made about the 75th Hunger Games, I felt my heart drop.  I also love that the books expands on Katniss and Peeta's relationship.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good read!<br />I enjoyed the ups and downs of the book and the happy ending. Also happy that those girls didn't have the last laugh.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|They didn't have to work too hard to make it better since it was filmed in HD, but it is definately better than the HD I saw on cable. Very happy with purchase.
B005HSL626|4.0|My 3 year old and I love to play this game together. He names the fruit as we slice the and screams 'oh no' when he see's the bombs.
B000002KDO|3.0|I bought it for one song.I haven't listened to the rest.I will get around to listening to the rest.The rest is probably good.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|World of Goo very fun and it entertains all three of my kids. The 13 year old likes it the most.
B008JAGG38|3.0|I'm not a big fan of the series,but it was just as raunchy as the first two movies.I like seeing them grow up.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After watching the hunger games movie, I knew there would be a second. I never read the first book but wish I had after reading this. By far one of the best books I have ever read. Only took me like two days to read, I didn't want to put it down. Definitely going to read the third one starting today. Totally worth the time and money!
B000002KHH|5.0|This is my favorite Black Sabbath album.This is their best.I still listen to it some times.I would like to hear more.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book. More than just an adventure story, \\"Life of Pi\\" was an incredibly detailed biography of the life of a young Indian boy, in search of a spiritual and meaningful existence. The book is written in such a way that immediately, the reader feels that Pi is telling his story directly to the reader. Despite the extraordinary and impossible circumstances of the book, the reader becomes drawn into the story by Martel's voice and Pi's relatability. Overall, a great read.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|This was a very scary movie because it could possibly happen.  Non-stop action and wondering who was going to end up dead.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was one of the greatest books I have ever read.I am only 11 years old so I might not have a good idea in books but,I consider reading this book
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I have always been a &#34;Trekkie&#34;.  I am 77 years old and that is one of the best science fictions ever.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|It's was quite hard to decide how many stars to give. At some point of the story I was prepared to put it down and in some parts it was hard to stop :). It was probably this unnecessary text that caused the stars to drop. It is not necessary to describe the descending or ascending of stairs over 20 pages, especially as nothing of interest happens during it.<br />But otherwise, the boring bits excluded, the story is quite cool and interesting.
B005VTS4EY|1.0|This works great on my wife's Tab but it crashes the Player 5.0 every time I try it.  Freezes the machine &amp; the only solution is turn all the way off &amp; restart. Uninstalling.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is my primary weather service. I check it at least 2 times a day and always feel up to date on the forecast. Very simple to use with all the features I want and little filler.
B008KE3960|5.0|This is an all around fun and entertaining game. Strategy is applicable if you want to go for gold. Download and enjoy.
0316227706|4.0|This was a gift.  It shipped on time and was great for a dog lover. . . . . .
B004I744AS|4.0|This is going to be a great app for my kids and will help them with their homework and their project for school.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I am a Star Wars freak so I love this game. So fun. I don't play many games but this is a big exception.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really love this game.  My oldest son talked me into getting this game and I have really enjoyed playing this game as well as my children.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Always fun to watch these guys.  They are sooo funny!!!  It is nice that I can watch any time that I want to.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|This game is easier for the kids to play than it is for myself.  I find it a little hard to get the ball to even get into the pinball machine.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This is the best tv show ever!!!  I always laugh!!!  It is so funny.  It is nice to have the DVDs so I can watch any time I want to.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I have really enjoyed taking pictures using this app on my Kindle Fire HD.  The pictures are very clear and it is very easy to use.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I enjpy columbo. The price was cheaper than anyone I could find on the internet. I look forward to watching them all.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is great on my Kindle Fire HD.  It is very easy access and comes up very quickly on my Kindle.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|good item, good price, very satisfied. It was exactly what I wanted. The price was cheaper than I found on eBay.
0061730335|3.0|This was a reading assignment for my 14 year old son and it was great to be able to get it in a timely matter for him.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is an awesome game!!! Just wish you got a few free hints every day! Then it would be perfect!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Can't wait until Season 2.  The dialog and story leaves you wanting more.  Hope the series continues for many more seasons.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved the narrative, the imagery and the simplicity of the story. I was also moved by the ending wich was very open yet heartfelt. I highly recommend this lovely book.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Jon Hamm is sensational ... the story is fantastic.  Hope this show continues for a long time to come.  Keep it coming!
B000PC0S5K|5.0|this book will be meant for some and not for others. You will discover this as you read it. If you get the material, practice it, if you don't understand it and find it cheesey, move on to another book, and maybe comback to it in a few years.
B000VX041Q|4.0|very good quality I like the shoes and that is why I ordered same. Best regards. They are comfortable and snazzy
B001F12J48|1.0|Got a bad copy of the film.  The 3D disc does not work. It does play, but the colors are off, sort of a ghosting of the red band to the right of where it should be.  As I have had this for almost a year before playing it I doubt I can return/exchange it but.....  so don't do what I did.  Play the movie soon after ordering it just to make sure it works.  The other 3D movies I have work fine, just this one has problems.  I will be trying firmware updates shortly, but don't have much hope.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I just want to thank Dr. Alexander for writing about is NDE.  I have read many books on the subject and on ADC. My twin brother passed less then two weeks ago.  He suffered a great deal.  I am at peace with his passing because of people like Dr. Alexander who has had the courage to share their personal experiences with us.  This book gave me the scientific explanation that has been missing from other books. I have read many books on this subject and ADC.  I have had to take them purely on my own faith of the afterlife.  My faith in God the Father and God the Son, and truly God the Holy Spirit who is my Comforter only reinforces my conviction of eternal life.
B001992NUQ|5.0|One of the best movies ever.  The special features are awesome and having it on blu ray is just money.
B009IQ0TGM|3.0|Good Album but could be much better with better songwriting/producing.  There is a lot of repeating lines...almost like the songwriters couldn't think of anything to write....Overall not bad ...maybe her next album will have better songs.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Comes with a HD DVD copy plus a bonus features disc.  It also has the blu ray cope included which was great
B0086700CM|5.0|Another great app for the whole family...Frustrating when you die but so much fun!!!  Great for pre-teens and older!  Definitely one of our favorite apps...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|One of my favorite apps!! I play this game multiple times a day-that's how much I love it!! It is worth it!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a terrific game for the whole family.  We pass the Kindle back and forth to see who can cut more fruit!!!  Even my 5 year old granddaughter loves it!  And, she beats me!!!  It is so fun for short term entertainment!!!
B009LY72LQ|5.0|This is a very creative product for any kid who likes Monster High.  My daughter is 8 and she loved putting it together and mixing the parts.  It is a very entertaining and fun for kids to do.
0688091717|5.0|Really upbeat lesson on the merits individuality, while being able to maintain happy relationships with others!  The illustrations and story were absolutely charming.
B003NGTYPA|5.0|My favorite movie to watch every Christmas season.  A family tradition for both children and adults. Ages 6 and up will be enchanted.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another great Clancy book. It's interesting how he passes the tourch to new, younger members of the Ryan familey. I'm never disappointed in a Tom Clancey fiction book
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. I liked the book so much I couldn't stop reading it .very good book.
B00447G2PM|5.0|This is a very interesting 3D movie. I think it's a bit pricey for the length of the feature, however if you want to learn what's in the waters your swimming in, watch it.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|This is a good movie! It has good values, compelling romance, and just enough action. It is a great movie for couples married or dating.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Everything was fantastic HD quality. I noticed the &#34;Half Blood Prince&#34; Blue-Ray disk appeared rushed. Its the only disk that says &#34;Disk 1&#34; as though they just took a disk off the Collectors edition and inserted it into the collection.<br /><br />Its a great holiday treat to watch all the movies in progression. The actors grow and even though Ive seen it all several times before. Watching them all in the same week does make a huge difference in the overall story enjoyment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a great game. It's fun to play. Gets very addicting. You won't ever want to put it down. My first time playing I played for thirty minutes straight. Some games are challenging but that's what is the most fun.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The only thing that kept this book from being a 5 is there were too many unanswered questions at the end but they were good set-ups for the next book.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! I was hooked after the first chapter and finished it in 24 hours. I do understand how.some of the bad things people say about the book. There is a lot of violence and the realtionship isn't the healthiest. What I liked is that it was realistic. Every girl is attracted to a bad boy and we end up getting burned by them but in this story he actually really loves her even though the relationship isn't perfect. I will admit it was a roller coaster ride at times and I would get aggravated with their actions but I still couldn't quit reading. I think the name beautiful disaster was perfect for this book. I think it is a hit or miss book and everyone should read it for themselves! I personally thought it was a hit
B0036EDVS0|4.0|a great movie.  I wish it was possible to puce the HD version instead of just renting.  My wife and I enjoy watching This every Halloween.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The Way of Kings is a fantasy epic that has become one of my favorite books.  It contains an ingenuitive system of magic and a very believable cast of characters.  The suspense and plot twists are subtle and quite believable, but the book makes it difficult to put down because what happens next is so much of a mystery.  It is a fairly unpredictable yet easily plausible fantasy book.  One of Brandon Sanderson's best works in my opinion, and I have read almost all of his books. Be aware that it is VERY difficult to put down.
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|sounds better on show<br />would not buy again<br />disappointed with cd<br />show is better than cd<br />dont buy until listening to songs first
B003O86FMW|4.0|Exciting second book in this series...can't wait to read the next one! Although my favorite so far is still the first!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I enjoyed it, plenty of plot twists, but the ending was predictable and boring.  Good but not Child's best work.
