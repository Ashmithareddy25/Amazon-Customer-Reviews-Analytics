B005LA3Z9M|5.0|I absolutely loved this story. I smelt the flowers, I felt the anger and frustration and shed the tears of joy.<br />I will never give another flower to anyone without considering the meanings again. Excellent book
B001HN6922|2.0|Really didn't care for the storyline. Thought it was too difficult for young children to follow which defeats the purpose of a children's movie.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I'm not a big fan of movies this long, usually they are just that.... Too long. With this movie, after 2 hours and 46 minutes, I still wanted more. I was bummed that it was over, and on top of that, it seemed more like the movie was only running about 30 minutes. Also, I do not usually write any sort of reviews, but this movie rocks, and felt like I needed to say it.
1439163154|4.0|Palo Alto is an interesting read. I am sure I would have enjoyed it more if I was familiar with the area. The author does a good job setting the scene with location, however does not describe the locations I felt like I was an outsider looking in opposed to being fully immersed in the various adventures and mishaps of the teenagers of Palo Alto.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun it is kind of like temple run but in a better version I think this is awesome and fun
B000002U9L|5.0|It's the sound track for one of the greatest cult classics of all time! I love all of David Bowie's Tracks! If you don't have it get it! If you enjoyed the film you'll love reliving it via soundtrack.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This  is by far my favorite series yet!!!! I can't wait for the next one... sad that its taking so long.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I had so much fun with this movie.  I haven't seen it in years but was talking to some friends about it and had to order it.  It was just as good as the first time it came out.  I had to add it to my video library.
B005S9ELY4|5.0|i thought the movie was pretty cool...especially to go back in time and see some of the things that went down..the cops had their way of doing things and the mob had their way of doing things
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My grandchildren play it all the time! I need to get them their own Kindle so I can get mine back!
B003CYKCHW|1.0|The concept is good but this thing is such a pain to program. I give up fiddeling around with it.  It was a total waste of time fiddeling around with it.  I will be returning this RAT C$%P! tomorrow!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have been a big Fan for years and have seen it all.  I was very pleased with the movie and its quality.
B00A83075M|5.0|Cute story! Nice to see a bunch of guys from my video game days. The story line is cute and not too sugary.my six year old got the message very well.
B00005RYKU|4.0|I have to admit, I didn't see something coming as it did, which kept my interest, just glad to see good prevail.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I have been waiting to watch this show FOREVER! Now that DISH NETWORK gave us AMC, we have been watching & looking forward to Season 4!!! Who doesn't love seeing those flesh eating Zombies get theirs?!
1476733953|5.0|What a truly original story! I highly recommend this book! I am looking forward to reading the sequel.  Try it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game I think for kindle fire.I like creative but survival is the best.it is worth the 7.00.I cant explain how good this game is
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I pretty much felt like I was running a game studio. at one point in time I had delusions of my studio being EA so I made a trilogy of games with a terrible ending
B005H9B44A|5.0|Excellent movie!  I enjoyed the storyline and the acting.  The visual effects were stunning.  I hope there is a sequel soon!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it!<br /><br />I love Pinterest! The food is my favorite. I love looking at the clothes especially the wedding dresses
B00992CF6W|4.0|I bought the Minecraft PC version about a year and a half ago. I still enjoy it. A few months ago I decided to give this a try. It was good for a while. However,  I guess Mojang got too many complaints about the game not being updated enough,  and added random things that have nothing to do with mc on xbox or Pc. However, I still enjoy this game and recommend it to anyone. Also,  if you enjoy this,  you will LOVE Minecraft Pc. GO MOJANG!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it ok it has problem but it is fun and I have a son who is seven and he loves the game well to kids
0486438600|5.0|This is nothing like the other small henna tattoo books.  This is a multiple page stencil book of amazing designs.  Depending on your foot/hand size you just have to enlarge the photo a bit then trace and transfer to your skin or just practice on plastic like in cake decorating school. Just beautiful-definitely recommend to Mendhi tattoo enthusiasts!!!
B0035V35PI|4.0|Best ninja movies I've seen!  Director brought a new approach to the genre, especially the way he used graphics and weapon takes...
1451695187|5.0|Very powerful story. It will awaken your heart and soul. A must read!<br />give you a sense of peace to know you are eternal.
0374533571|5.0|I literally finished this book in five days. I could no believe how great the book was. I heard a lot of my friends say how great the movie was, so I thought i should read the book before I saw it.<br />I could not have been more pleased. I'm surprised that this book even has ratings below four stars. I get the fact that no everyone has the same taste, etc. But I love this book soooo much!
B0025KVLV0|5.0|Great CD, digital re-master was done well. Sound quality is very good. I think it is one of the best Beatles albums recorded. I like every song that was put on it.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|Have known and listened to Willie since he started way back when.  You have to get past all the hype and just enjoy the music.
B00136JS8U|5.0|This album came out in 1995 and was the hottest album of that summer. This era of Hip Hop the artist in my opinion focused on the album being mega hot rather then 2 or 3 singles. Raekwon and Ghost just clicked at a level on this album that was never matched again. They came close on the Ironman album but this was great from start to finish. The beats by the Rza made him top producer in the Rap game and started a trend that many producers bit off of(ex. shark bitters: humming voice used as a beat). Only Built for Cuban Linx will always be in my top ten albums of all time.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|I love Once Upon a Time, Grimm and Warehouse 13.  I love the Syfy channel, especially those weekend movie marathons with supernatural themes.  I had never seen 'Supernatural' so at a friend's suggestion, used Amazon for the Pilot, just to get a taste.  Well, I am hooked and will now have to buy the 1st Season and get caught up.  The brothers' relationship is actually interesting, the phenomomum different and I really liked the way they explained why these things develop (like The Woman In White).  Well worth the $1.99 instead of buying the whole Season and then deciding I didn't like the show.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It wouldn't have been something that I would normally read, but I am glad I did.  The main character, Hazel, has terminal cancer.  She knows at some point that she is going to die, so she tries to shut herself off from having a real life and meeting other people.  Then she meets Gus and her life changes.  This novel is absolutely hilarious at times and completely sad at other times.  This is not just a story about cancer, it is a story about friendship, family relationships, and finding adventure in a shortened life.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I appreciated Sheryl sharing her vulnerabilities as a leader, woman, wife and mother. The book kept me engaged by sharing real experiences and offering advice along the way. It provided great insights for me personally - on how I hold myself back - and more importantly &#34;why&#34; I do this - as a woman, wife and mother. And of equal importance it made me understand the importance of tearing down stereotypes - I have two daughters.<br /><br />I was able to connect with her journey both  in business and at home - even though we are worlds apart - this book has inspired me and why I gave it a rating of 5.<br /><br />Thank you Sheryl!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Awesome journey. Great and easy read. Keep an open mind. I believe cause so many others r brave enough to share their experience.
B00000K3D4|4.0|This movie is a classic! Misunderstood by most and some areas you can tell it was made before more technology came out, but who wouldn't fight a goblin king to save a brother.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|Really couldn't properly rate the Adobe reader since it didn't work with my device.....Unfortunate since every other app has worked fine after I've downloaded it. The Troubleshooting steps were pretty worthless as well.
1781164266|3.0|Before this, the only other artbook I've gotten was &#34;The Art of Mass Effect&#34;, so that's where most of my reference will be to when reviewing this book ...<br /><br />The presentation, both in the material of the book itself, and the general design layout of the pages is top-notch; no complaints there.  And I love any hardback with thick, crisp, gloss pages, so major kudos there.  On that and the number of sections and the quality of the illustrations, I would almost give this book a 4 star review.<br /><br />However, there's a couple of general disappointments.<br /><br />First, I like my artbooks to be a good balance of original concept drawings and explainations on the thought process that drove those illustrations and concepts.  This book does that, but only so often, and when it does, it tends to be rather sparse.  Additionally, it tends to show just an illustration of what you can already see in pixels in the games themselves ... I don't want that; I want to see what I CAN'T see in the game, the stuff that DIDN'T make it into the game, the stuff that was so crazy and imaginative it was considered, but ultimately cut.  My second complaint is related to this, in that I feel like many of the illustrations and paragraphs are filler material.  There are several 2 page spreads with (admittedly cool) illustrations, but not of stuff that is ultimately spectacular or original looking; most of these, again, tend to be illustrations of what's in the game.  Going with this are paragraphs that tend to ramble a bit, to the point that a few 3 or 4 paragraph bits end up really only telling you one or two things.  I would prefer these paragraphs to be focused more on describing actual developmental processes and how the various objects, vehicles, settings, and Necromorphs were inspired and created, and less about people's feelings or what was going on in their life at that time, or (in a few instances) just describing what I can see by moving my eyes to the opposite page ...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: this is ultimately a good quality book of good quality illustrations and artbook.  And there are various discussions about how things like Isaac's armor was inspired, developed, and re-developed, or the ideas that went into various settings, or the inspirations for various Necromorphs.  Further, there is a decent number of &#34;progress&#34; collections --- sets of quick sketches showing how a concept evolved.  But for almost every one of these that occur, two or three other interesting subjects are skimmed over.  Ultimately, this book could have been compiled and written better.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book was exciting, refreshing, and  very humbling. From training, to war, back home and repeat. The incredible sacrifices these people make on a daily basis so far from home, never knowing what is waiting around the corner to harm them. This book really lets you have a glimpse into their world and see their struggles and fierce bravery. Thank you, to all of the soldiers before and after 9/11 for your service and willingness to do what it takes to keep our country safe.  RIP Chris Kyle good job!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Truly free alarm clock that works like a charm. Been using it for a week, and it's replaced my cell phone alarm already.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Super good film. The torture was pretty graphic but definitely made me think and reflect on our America presence over seas. In all, the whole movie was exciting, nerve wracking and moving.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|This camera is very dependable and now that I have it I can't live without it! It's easy to set up and it really makes me feel good to be able to stay in touch with my pets no matter where I am! I have the app on my iPhone and both iPads. It can also be used in the car. I have my two puppies in a crate and can watch and hear them while in restaurants. Love it!!!
B004ZG5F28|5.0|Bridget Jones is so quirky and believably likable to watch. This movie is just one of those movies, that no matter how old; it is worth watching again, and again...
B009JBZH54|5.0|Three great films, awesome quality, great extras. The picture book is beautiful. Special features were mostly very well done. and original.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Great look inside the life of a seal. From the battlefield to coming home and coping with war.  A must read
1401233791|5.0|This actually volumes 1 and 2!!!! A must have for any Batman fan. Great to see how this story line influenced the Dark Knight films...one of the best Batman story lines.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Worth the money. Was mad when the update came out because I just got the soccer balls and it still says i collected all 10 but i cant unlock it in the weapons store. Other than that this game has been fun and well worth the money spent on it.
B0042FZOFU|2.0|We love all the movies. I am just very disappointed that I read and trusted the reviews which stated Blu-rays, DVDs and digital copies were included. It sounded too good to be true...we only received Blu-ray Discs
B001NLL93W|5.0|PERFECT!! ONE of the best books I have ever had the pleasure to have read and loved!! I love the mortal instruments series!!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow when I was younger. I remember trying to read this book then and got bored with it-- it didn't have all the action the first books had. But now (I'm 20) I think it's great. Orson Scott Card is an incredible writer and this book covers many interesting themes of psychology and science fiction. I didn't want to put it down.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is captivating, and has you on your seat waiting to see what will unfold next for the people of Downton Abbey.
0446572985|5.0|David Baldacci is the consummate story teller as evidenced by his ability to always capture the interest and attention of his readers through the many books and themes he has written.  The Innocent does not involve any of the protagonists involved in his other books, but does, as always, create an immediate bond with the principal characters of this novel. Will Robie is a hitman for the CIA who has completed many assignments to take out enemies of the US that regular actions cannot remove.  In his latest job he is directed by his controller to assassinate a woman and her child.  Upon arrival at the scene of the assignment he has the sensation that something is not quite right and does not complete the killing.  The woman and child are immediately shot by a backup assassin and Robie  goes on the run with the probability that his own department is  after him.  Boarding a bus to travel to New York from DC he meets a young girl that is fleeing the scene of her parent's murders and understands that she is earmarked by the killers to be next.  Will develops a need to protect her and promises to find out who the people are that killed her parents while continuing to work on his own problems.<br />  Robie's situation and that of the girl coincidentally  involve the same background circumstances and moving towards resolution brings out a side that Will did not realize he possessed.  That, is an empathy for another human being, and the need to protect her.  On the way to finding out what has happened Will develops an appreciation that the girl is a bright and analytical person and builds on his liking for her.  At the same time Robie meets a girl living in a building next to his and in spite of his background falls in love with her.  Both situations are integral parts of the story and resolved to the reader's satisfaction.<br />  As in all of his books, the principal characters are fleshed out and believable.  They experience real emotions and don't meander  through the plot.The novel's conclusion is a very logical projection of the incidents and findings encountered and leave the reader completely satisfied.  Another protagonist that has the ability to appear in a future book and leave us hoping that he will.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose this rating because I enjoyed the book. It was amazing I liked everything about this book. I would definitely recommend this book to those who want to read an action packed movie.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|WOW!!!!! An ABSOLUTELY Have to Read. Thea Harrison wrote a series that will capture All YOUR Senses with her captivating,witty,sensuous and intense characters blended with engrossing situations that keeps you riveted to every moment of reading experience she brings to her writing.  YOU Will NEVER  BE DISAPPOINTED WITH HER WRITING!!!! SO ENJOYABLE READING PLEASURE.
0307477479|4.0|A Visit from the Goon Squad, by Jennifer Egan is a very highly acclaimed winner of the 2011 Pulitzer Prize.  I would say that the style is unique, but having recently finished reading Cloud Atlas, I see similarities.  As in Cloud Atlas, A Visit from the Goon Squad features a highly non-linear narrative form, with a series of vignettes beginning in the present day, proceeding backward in time, with characters in the preceding story playing a leading role in those that follow.  After four such stories, we follow the characters through a series of stories back to the present day and into the future, though not necessarily in chronological order and skipping from one character to another.<br /><br />Unlike Cloud Atlas, the characters in the stories in A Visit from the Goon Squad are consistent and closely related, the stories therefore being more easily followed and the transitions smoother.  The stories are intriguing and captivating.  This is a far better reading experience than Cloud Atlas.<br /><br />Nevertheless, leaving and returning to a variety of characters, at points in the past and in the future, in no particular order, has the potential for confusion and periods of reacclimation.  Such was the case here, at times, though not to the extent of seriously affecting the reading experience.  Having said that, I read the entire book in only three or four days.  Stretching the book out over a period of weeks could result in the potential for becoming lost or losing track of the characters.  Despite being listed as having 342 pages, roughly 50 are consumed with a rather silly stretch of \\"powerpoint slides\\".  The book can be easily consumed in 4-5 hours.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|This book started off good, and then petered out for me. Tina Fey doesn't really have a lot to say.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|The bad: I purchased this device after reading that it is able to supply up to 2.4 Amps to Apple products and 1.8 Amps to Android phones. This seemed to be the highest of any FCC certified device with a 12 volt input. When I received the device, I noticed that the specifications on the back side of the box indicate lower amperage output than what is listed in the description. The back of the box indicates that the device is only rated to supply 2.1 Amps to Apple products and 1.5 Amps to Android phones. While the difference is not huge, it erases the margin by which this product exceeds the specs of competitors. I would never expect my phone to draw anywhere near the amperage listed on the product description on the website but I prefer to draw a lower percentage of the possible output to ensure that the device doesn't overheat or risk blowing a fuse. To find that this safety margin is thinner than I had been led to believe is disconcerting.<br /><br />The good: I have yet to try operating both ports at the same time but using a single port, this device does not seem to run hot and, coupled with an appropriate charging cable, it seems able to charge my phone without issue. Despite being made in China, the charger appears fairly well constructed and doesn't seem flimsy or likely to come apart with normal use. I would compare it to the higher end products that Monoprice releases. They too are made in China but they tend to work very well and appear solid throughout. I like that I can see the FCC logo (and the CE logo) on this product, as it makes me less concerned that it will catch fire, blow up, or otherwise ruin my day. Also, the device appears to stay in the plug reasonably well. It doesn't work loose as easily as other similar devices. For the money, it appears to offer a lot over some of the \\"name\\" brands (e.g., Griffin, Belkin, etc.).<br /><br />The neutral: There are no LEDs. I happen to like this, as I prefer not to have any more lights in my car than absolutely necessary. Less distraction at night. I can tell it's charging by looking at my device. Though I am a fan of the simplistic design, if this bothers you and you need an LED, look elsewhere. I couldn't see that the fuse is user replaceable. That said, if it blows, you are probably doing something wrong to begin with. You shouldn't be using anywhere near the max amperage this device can put out.
B0053B347M|3.0|Probably would work great on a desktop monitor, but doesn't fit on the back of a monitor/TV if mounted on a wall, as the mounting bracket is in the way.
B008EEHRAU|5.0|Great movie but be sure to have some chocolate in the house before watching!  I find this a timeless classic.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its a good game overall. there are some minor glitches with it freezing here and there. it's. interesting and a great time killer
B000E33W1C|5.0|Just updating my DVD collection as I love this movie and only had it on VCR tape. My grandson watched in a film class at college.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My 2 year old loves this app she calls it &#34;crocodile&#34; she has gotten the hang of it in such a short amount of time and it helps her learn her alphabet. She get so excited when she completes a letter, it's a great app
B00ATUEKY8|3.0|I had high expectations about this book i guess. I'm halfway through and its just dragging on but hopefully it picks up soon
B00AYR2FQ6|4.0|It's funny when you think you've discovered new music, but an artiste like this spends all his time and passion to make beautiful music like in this album \\"Muchacho\\". Nevertheless, I am happy and grateful to discover Phosphorescent. The standout tracks to me are \\"Terror in the Canyons\\" and \\"Song for Zula\\". Excellent Album: engaging voice, excellent lyricist, haunting melodies. Great package.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|Love this duo! Witty, hilariously inapporiate, dramatic when needed and just down right FUNNY!! These two have great chemistry and this odd couple works.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Too many advertisements.  (not ad-free) Each level seemed to be the same thing. Boring.<br />My kindle kept locking up,  Once I deleted it, no more problems
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I decided to read this book after Chris Kyle died. I first heard of him from the show &#34;Sons of Guns&#34; when he made a guest appearance. This book gives such detail of what war was like. I believe every American should read it because I frankly believe most Americans forget there is a war going on and that men & women are sacrificing their lives everyday to keep this violence from our shores.<br />I love the excerpts from his wife. I am a military wife(not a seal) but everything she talks about I have felt to some degree in my own marriage and she does a wonderful job expressing & explaining those feelings!<br />He was a atrue Hero!! I have NO doubt he sits in Heaven today!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|.I guess this game okay.Many pop ups,but kinda fun.You get to do the same thing over and over again, it gets boring.All the treats and equipment is really expensive.Get this game.Or don't.Didn't effect my life.
B008FOB124|5.0|It has been over 10 years since their last album, but Dead Can Dance still has it ! 'Anastasis' sounds fresh but still familiar Dcd territory with nice rhytms and foreign-sounds. Very recommended !
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I loved this book. Jeaniene Frost is such a talented and creative writer. Cat and Bones are amazing and I can't wait to read the next book. I will read anything that Jeaniene Frost writes :)
B00005QGAX|5.0|yes i would tell anyone who loves mj to get this cd. got it in a timely matter and was in good condition. very happy with order.
1608870081|5.0|This is my first purchase of pop-up book, i love it at the first sight. But one or two pages are sticky when first opened. It's a interesting and lovely book.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is all much fun. I can't stop playing it.the graphics are very good as well. Just l I've it!
B00A25NM2Q|5.0|Kang offered a harrowing, but insightful view into the terror that is the North Korean regime. The fact that the government can and does enslave innocent people is bizarre and terrifying. Whilst well written and easy to read, the content is not easy to face. That said, it is an essential read that anyone with an interest in North Korea should read!
B003NFM3JK|3.0|If you collect Dicken's Christmas Carol movies like I do, you probably should have it, just because. Maybe some undiscerning niece or nephew may want to see it. But among the others made, it's kind of a joke. Adding BIG effects and graphics, and changing the story to do so, does not a hit remake make,
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Been a fan for a few years now and really am enjoying his music. A little too much melodyne for my taste but his voice fits it and I know what he can do without it, so I'm not gonna complain.
B00BRYDKM8|2.0|I do not like being held hostage by a website to read a book. Either sell the damn thing or don't make it available. Free is not free when you have to come to a website page to read it every time. Is it good? Who knows? I can't tolerate having to go load a web page to read it.<br /><br />Of what I have read, ti seems okay. But it's one of those books where someone writes a book about what another book said. A ripoff, basically, If you want to hear it the way it was ORIGINALLY written, just go get 'Make it Stick' by Heath, and you won't have to read this copy-cat's additional words too.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I'm twenty-seven years late to Les Miserables, the musical. I'll admit it. I wasn't interested until the movie was getting press. It looked really cool, and the likelihood of me ever seeing it on stage seemed slim and not something I really, hugely wanted.<br /><br />So I went with my friend, who'd already seen the stage show and the movie (she went before I did).<br /><br />I can honestly say that there are three narratives that have altered the course of my life, and they're the Lord of the Rings, Supernatural, and now, most recently, Les Mis.<br /><br />As a rule, I don't do tragedy. I don't do stories where everybody dies. I refuse to do Titanic for that very reason.<br /><br />But dear god, am I glad that I made the exception for this one.<br /><br />The Movie is an enormous, beautiful mix of the fantastic musical with snippets of canon from the book thrown in. Bahorel's back, though he never made the musical, Enjolras and Grantaire die side-by-side as in the brick, and nobody's quite as romanticized by the movie as they are by the musical, and I love it. I couldn't have asked for a better introduction.<br /><br />Russell Crowe will always be my Javert, for example. He brings a depth to the man that can't be done on stage. I love stage!Javert, I do -- Norm Lewis is fantastic and rigid as iron in the 25th anniversary special, for example -- but Crowe, Crowe gives me a sadder Javert, a Javert who is falling even before he seems to realize it himself. And he is /gentler/, too; when he tells Fantine, &#34;I have heard such protestations/Every day for twenty years/Let's have no more explanations/Save your breath, save your tears,&#34; he almost seems to pity her. Stage!Javert, on the other hand, is often openly disdainful with these lines, often emphasizing that last word as though the idea of the &#34;whore&#34; crying sickens him because she is a criminal and in his eyes deserves it and should take it without weeping,<br /><br />I don't mourn stage-Javert, I pityhim. But Crowe's Javert made me hurt for him, and he remains one of my favorite parts of the movie.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway may not be the most vocally powerful Fantine we've ever had, but the starkness of Fantine's plight makes for brilliant cinema in ways that, again, the stage show can't. Reordering &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; to come after &#34;Lovely Ladies&#34; is an inspired choice, because it renders the song to be part of the very lowest, darkest point in Fantine's tragedy.<br /><br />Moving forward, the &#34;barricade boys&#34; are absolutely brilliant. With Killian Donnelly (a former Enjolras on stage) as Combeferre and Broadway star Aaron Tveit as Enjolras, we're in very good hands for Les Amis de l'ABC. Tveit brings a brilliant physicality to the part of Enjolras, and his facing his mortality in &#34;Drink With Me&#34; (which, unfortunately enough, cuts out Grantaire's fairly pivotal verse to that effect) with nothing more than a few sorrowful looks is absolutely brilliant. I love Enjolras more than practically any other fictional character, and Tveit is one of my favorite people who've played him.<br /><br />Many of the barricade boys are even better upon rewatching -- I didn't fall in love with Combeferre until my third viewing, when I realized how much he loves the rest of the Amis, how willing he is to take care of all of them in his way. He's their arsenal (alluded to when he is double-wielding pistols on the barricade) and their guide and dies with a comforting hand on Joly's arm. Feuilly is also wonderful, and the friendship between Courfeyrac and Gavroche is absolutely heartbreaking, with Courf sobbing openly when Gavroche is murdered.<br /><br />But most understated and most beautiful, I think, is George Blagden as Grantaire, the group's cynic and drunk. As I mentioned before, Grantaire's verse in &#34;Drink With Me&#34; was cut, which is a pretty major piece of characterization for both him and for, in many stage productions, his dynamic withEnjolras. In the brick, it's stated flat out that Grantaire worships Enjolras, and Blagden's Grantaire makes it clear with every movement, every glance, from beginning to end. He captures the essence of the cynic with only one thing to believe in, and I could write reams of analysis on the subject.<br /><br />Cinematically, the film is almost perfect. The only issue I had is the overuse of background blurring in &#34;Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.&#34; But that's literally, along with the missing DWM verse, the only flaw in the movie. I'm a film major, and I can only dream of ever making a movie this perfect, and this apropos to the time it's been released.<br /><br />You see, we're, globally, in a time of intense political, economic, and social upheaval.  We, in the US specifically, are a culture in flux.  A culture due, I think, for a few revolutions.  Without Les Mis, I wouldn't have become nearly as passionate for change as I am, and I certainly wouldn't have sat down and decided to read a book with 2600 pages in it for fun and then proceed to start a project where I give my summer to Enlightenment-through-post-1848 political discourse.  Les Mis opened me up to a whole new universe of possibility for my future, and I think it has for a lot of its new fans, even though it's so solidly set in the past.  I have to call forth the final lines of &#34;Finale,&#34; here -- &#34;Will you join in our crusade?/Who will be strong and stand with me?/Somewhere beyond the barricade/is there a world you long to see?/Do you hear the people sing?/Say do you hear the distant drums?/It is the future that we bring when tomorrow comes!&#34;  The story asks us to look at the world around us.<br /><br />And, when we find it wanting, stand up and do something about it.<br /><br />And that's a message I can throw myself behind wholeheartedly.  The future doesn't just come; we make it, we shape it into what it is -- that's the whole point, in the end, of the story.  With love, and because of love, we are strong enough to fight for the future we want and deserve.<br /><br />Maybe we'll fail.  Maybe we'll only have reward in Heaven.  And maybe we'll succeed.<br /><br />But we'll never know which if we never try.
B007REV4YI|4.0|This is one of the best 007 movies, the music, the lighting and all the acting on this movie is just amazing
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Given that the movie is based on real life events, it was enjoyable. it was suspenseful when it needed to be, and a good mix of drama and comedy (ok, dry comedy).
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie is excellent, no wonder this won an Oscar, excellent production and very talented actors, the costumes are amazing
B00BESLHEA|4.0|A classic Tarantino movie. Blood spraying action in the Kill Bill genre.  Probably not my first choice for a &#34;chick flick&#34;, but she wasn't home when I watched it and I really enjoyed it.
B007REW8DO|5.0|Ms. Perri, one of the best singers in this times, she has so much feeling on every song, and amazed about her talent
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Another fun installment with On Nom. New levels and tools mean new challenges. Easy to pickup and start playing but hard to put down.
B000002UR7|5.0|I bought this cd, because i lost the first one i bought years ago, and love the song Creep, Friends ask me to burn copies of this
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this series so much that I had to buy this for my mom. I was going to buy a set for myself but didn't. Getting a digital copy was a nice surprise!
B000R7I3LY|4.0|This was a gift for my best friend, and he love it. the whole cd has a lot of excellent songs. 1005 satisfied
B001G0LBZ6|5.0|Great soundtrack! And I love that I got 2 CDs out of it! If you love the movie because of the music, this purchase is a no-brainer.

B000M53GM2|5.0|I bought this thinks complete my James Bond collection. Golden Eye was a great Bond movie with Pierce Brosnon. This will be a classic.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|I love their sound, unlike other bands now their sound is unique. They can cross the line and appeal to the younger pop group; and they will appeal to older adults who like a great blue's/rock sound.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, I'm hooked on it.......'.................you should get it<br />It will be fun you wouldn't want to put it down
B000GWE44U|5.0|Great movie. I just love this movie. Very vintage, good lighting, good plot, very good acting. Some of Jack Nicholson's best work.
B009AMANBA|1.0|Ok, the acting is good and the sets are great. That is were it all ends. After about 10 minutes into the films you notice that this film is racially bias. The name of this film should be Abe Lincoln and the racist whitey gang. Yes, slavery is bad beyond words, but hey Mr. Spielberg next time make a documentary so we do not think this movie is about Abraham Lincoln. Bad story line that is about 60 minutes to long.
B0049M7BDE|5.0|I really love this movie,this is the first movie that me and my wife watch in the movie theatre together.  unfortunately there's not much special features in the disc
B000FC1KBG|5.0|I've read tons of parenting books and this is definitely the one with more sensible advice. I'd recommend it to any parent hoping to keep their life and sanity after baby is born.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Sure they don't make many good film about MMA.. but boy.. this one is sure delivers. If you love MMA, or any good drama.. don't miss it. i'm sad that this film is not a bigger success in box office when it was released in USA. now this is the chance to watch this wonderful film
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay was a very good conclusion to the Hunger Game series. I found it a bit boring at times because all it was about was taking down the capital. No. I am not going to give away if they defeat the capital or not. That would give away the ending. My opinion, I think Suzanne did a great job concluding the Hunger Games.
B00867GKIK|5.0|Did I need to say anything more about this film? everybody love UP.. the marriage life montage always bring tears to my eyes.. that's probably LOVE and MARRIAGE at its best depicted in 10 minutes and without dialogue... it just beautiful
B008K8U13K|1.0|I would rate it if I could download it.. Having problems with both purchases.  If i could get help.  I would
6305428352|5.0|I think they need to release it in bluray format.. i will buy it again! This is a very touching and heartwarming film. richard dreyfuss at his best!
B001KF6FAI|1.0|I was very surprised that Dessi was cast as Tosca - she is unsuitable for this role both vocally and dramatically. Her Vissi d'arte does not move one emotionally! And it's Vissi d'arte!!! It is a sad sign of the sorry state of the operatic world that we are being served shoddy work such as this performance. For a good Tosca I would recommend either Tebaldi or Gheorghiu.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|If you love carl sagan.. if you love sci-fi then you MUST buy this one. i have the DVD version, but with all it's beautiful image you owe to your self to buy this film in bluray format. Jodie foster is always been my favorite actress.. so it's a must have for me
B0002CH8C4|1.0|I was very surprised that Dessi was cast as Tosca - she is unsuitable for this role both vocally and dramatically. Her Vissi d'arte does not move one emotionally!

0345525558|4.0|I really liked the book.  Very eye opening into the social welfare system.  The writer developed the story into a very &#34;can't but it down&#34; scenario.
014017821X|3.0|The Bloody Chamber by Angela Carter is a set of short stories that parody folk-tale and legend. Let's not beat about the bush. The bloody chamber in question is the vagina and the capital of these stories is sex. But they also re-interpret and re-work fairy tale, myth and legend so that the stories take on - literally and explicitly - the adult rating they always suggested.<br /><br />There are wolves that change into men, and men that change into wolves. Now there is versatility. One story, The Company Of Wolves, did in fact become a film in the 1980s, when Angela Carter's star shone bright.<br /><br />The Bloody Chamber offers re-thinks on Dracula and Bluebeard. It gives new life to Little Red Riding Hood and a prurient Puss-in-Boots. Here, Beauty meets Beast and, via these time-honoured characters and themes, Angela Carter explores sexuality, both reality and myth, from a female perspective. She describes the insecurity that arises from threat and the fear engendered by anticipated violence. But she also revels in the power to control, to entice, to render powerless through overdosing on ecstasy.<br /><br />A hint of torture is always near. The Bloody Chamber inhabits spaces in the human psyche that are never far from pain, always flirting with sadism. From the pain of unrequited love, right through to physical mutilation, the whole spectrum of torture appears to lie just beyond the pain of love. The boundary is often blurred in these stories and some characters meet decidedly sticky ends.<br /><br />But Angela Carter avoids merely gratuitous fantasy. We can all - if we have little imagination - describe women changing colour (for some reason or other), growing green scales, bursting out in fangs or claws and then sucking the life-blood from their lovers. Such fantastical scenarios soon become not only repetitive but also trite and meaningless if divorced from some rooting parallel of symbolism. In Angela Carter's work that linkage to a form of reality and experience always seems to be present. Folk tales and fairy stories persisted perhaps because of these links. Perhaps people never believed their literal truth, but their imagery did relate to some, often hidden aspects of experience or inner fear. Not all men are Bluebeards who imprison their wives in a state of undying suffering. Not all men change into werewolves and consume maidens. But then not every husband is always gentle with his wife. Not every lad approaches maidens with finesse.<br /><br />Enhancing these stories is Angela Carter's very special prose. It is far from silken smooth and rarely even aspires to the transparent. On the contrary, we are presented with a veritable brocade of language, a densely-woven and complex pattern of allusion, pun and metaphor. The texture is always pithy, the sound often dissonant. As ideas clash, so does the language that Angela Carter employs to pick the fight. In places the density may even be overdone, but in general the Gothic dark does lead us up to the vaults rather than oppress with its darkness.<br /><br />The style may be dated, and the original idea may be somewhat over-stated. But these stories remain beautifully written and still enthral.ence always seems to be present. Folk tales and fairy stories persisted perhaps because of these links.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read the book with my 11 yr old daughter.  I really enjoyed it.  Thanks for being an awesome writer.  Now on to the next book.
B004EPZ034|5.0|Movies are a great way to intertain children.  I have a tv in my car and they watch them all the time.  Which is great for me.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app above the others since I can see the weather data for my township. Otherwise I get the weather from a farther away source. I also like the functionality of the app.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Not one of Denzel's best movies. I would love to tell you what it's about because to write this review I have to use a certain amount of words...OH! I got my quota!
B00CBKLO52|5.0|The app is Great, It is just like you are actually controlling an RC aircraft, The graphics are excellent. Choices of different types of helicopters, Fixed wing aircraft and boats. You can chose different locations to practice. I would highly recommend using this app to become familiar with flight controls as aircraft is coming toward you, as they are reversed, that way, you do not damage an actual RC aircraft learning this. I would love to see cars added to app.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I'm not quite done with it... it is a little difficult to comprehend at times but is interesting.  I would like him to have gone into more details about some aspects that are talked about.  It is unlike any other experience that I have read about - very interesting.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Keeps me spellbound, escaping into a fantasy that seems very real.  Based on history brings yet another element of enjoyment.
0743277457|5.0|!The book arrived as described. A valuable piece of information to have at home. Will add this to my chess arsenal!
B003PBB4ME|5.0|So uses this with his digital camera and absolutely loves it. Had dropped it numerous times and it is very sturdy, not one crackk. Still working like a champ with no issues.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|I'm a huge fan and love all of her music! I can't wait for her next album. The new songs are DA BOMB! #TeamNickiMinaj
B003YQ1QUA|5.0|Wonderful. A treat for the soul. It a clear extension of Esparanza as a person. Would highly recommend to all.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is my favorite book in this series. It totally blew me away. I am really digging this POV writing style. It's very nicely done. The plot definitely took so turns in this book, but all of them left me saying Oh my god! Oh Jamie, what ever will you do without your incestrial hand that you use on Cersei? And John Snow, being torn apart by his honor and desires. How about Tyrion and Sansa?! That was crazy! OH man, the Red Wedding...wow! What a shocker! I did not see that coming at all. I actually had to stop and think about what just happened because it was so sudden and so unexpected, but yet so awesome at the same time. You can't just break a betrothal King of the North...You will pay for your injustice! And so will you Joffrey Baratheon! I hate you and I'm glad you were killed. And how weird was it when your incestrial parents had period sex at your wake? Whoa. And Dani, sweet Dani, I just love you! You go girl! A definite must read for everyone that is a fan of epic fantasy. You are top notch GRRM!
0316069434|5.0|I have read every Harry Bosch books and each one gives you additional insight to this LAPD Detective who will not let go until the case is solved.<br /><br />Some of the reviews were this is just a so so book; I feel that part of the enjoyment of each story brings forth a look into the personality of the main character and those in the story line.  They begin to feel like a family to you; you can not wait to see how is this solved; who will be the unexpected and does the book leave you wanting more.<br /><br />Without giving away too much information; this book can be branched off in 8 possible story lines and I may have missed a few.  Can't wait for the next Harry Bosch novel to come out.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Well now this book was a lot different from the first 3. I liked it, but that's about all. The one thing that I did really like was how you were able to see what is inside that twisted, wicked, and demented little head of Cersei's. I didn't really understand what happened in the Prolog of this book though. I read it about 4 times, but unless I missed something big, I didn't really see how that tied in to the story. But overall, it was just a continuation of the first 3. That's it.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I've seen this a few times now. I can't get over how great this movie is. I'm waiting to watch it on my 3D TV and I'm sure it will be even better then bluray.
0345535421|5.0|Oh, GRRM, you are so amazing. I started reading this book the same day I finished AGOT. The story is just amazing, and I was so addicted to this book.  In addition to the main characters, there are different characters in this book and I thought it was interesting to read their POV. Theon, what are you thinking grabbing your sister's breast like that? I laughed so hard at that. And Brienne, why are you so in love with Renly, that usurper! And Dani, you are just awesome! Again, it's a monster of a book, but well worth the time and effort. A definite must read!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I admit I am biased towards comic book heroes but still, this is a great movie for kids and adults alike. If your an American it should be extra special. Resolve and old fashioned American values are something kids should take away from this movie. Honor, courage and perseverance are virtues severely lacking in today's society. Captain America has it all.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This was the first epic fantasy novel I have ever read, and man was it good! I was totally hooked. GRRM's writing was amazing. I really loved that the book is written from different point of views. There was such a distinct style for each character, and I thought he did an outstanding job in building likable and unlikable characters. The story has so much depth to it. I was astonished when Jamie threw Bran of the side of Winterfell! Well I guess that's what you get when you find brother and sister having sex. But I think that and the letter from Catlin's sister that really starting things in motion for the entire series. There were some pretty ruthless killing in this book, but they were awesome too. Robert, while hunting wild boar; Ned, beheaded in front of Arya and Sansa by the word of Joffrey; And that kid Arya played with, Sangor just stabbing him with his sword. And poor Dani, abused by her brother and forced to marry Kahl Drogo, who burns Viscerys to death with a golden crown! And playing with a witch to make your husband better will only make your baby die Dani! Didn't you realize that? But burning the witch also has it's pros, I mean you got 3 dragons out of the deal! Not too shabby. It is a monster of a book and series, but well worth the time if you like epic fantasy. Definitely a must read!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|A very good book.read it many times! Hope to read it again soon! First time I've read it on my kindle though.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I read this book in 2 days. I thought it really blew City of Bones away. There was nonstop shadowhunter, vampire, werewolf, faerie, and warlock action from beginning to end! I mean, what more can you ask for? I really liked the major events of this book, but I won't spoil them for those who have not read it yet. I really didn't see a lot of them coming. Some things really took my breath away and left me speechless! And Magnus, oh Magnus! He is hilarious. Awesome book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun to play especially during long trips it keeps you busy and entertained. I just love subway surfer I always play it. The world tour idea was very creative it should go to somewhere cold next like Antarctica.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Good quick mystery game. The mini games are good but I feel like this is the first level in a bigger game. It was a really quick play. But for the price I cant complain.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was amazing. It was truly touching. I know how it feels to be August. It really reminds you to not to judge people by what they look like but who they are as a person. :)
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Really liked this game.There are a bunch of mini games and the graphics are really good. If you like mystery games this is definetely worth the money.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|That was better I thought it would be! A very good read. I am telling all my friends to read it. can't wait to read more of these books keep them coming!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is my favorite version of angry birds followed closely by the star wars version.  I really liked the game play in this one best and with no ads it is even better!!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Keeps you entertained. Lots of variety in tile set-up. Fun to play.<br />Shuffle and hint options are great. All in all I found the game is a nice way to pas the time.
B004V546IW|5.0|I'm very glad I got this book. I am now have a better understanding of the band that has been my soundtrack most of my life. This book makes them human not just superstars. I feel more connected with Bon Jovi even more now. Thanks guys for this gift of showing us your human side.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I LOVE the update they made. I'm waiting 'till I'm level 15 to go to Canterlot!  My only concern is that I can't keep Derpy!  T.T
B002APU580|5.0|I am a Dude with a Romance Hunger impressing dates.  This movie is the best sit down and relax with a significant other.  Whether you are mariied or single dating....get it for date movie night.  Romance and sparks will fly.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|really enjoyed this book, cant wait to read the rest of the series.Not just for kids, adults will be interested too.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Its a common game of matching like with like--- although the variety of tiles are stacked on top one another. Only tiles with exposed edges can be selected adding to the fun!
B0087GJ8KM|3.0|Some good tactical ideas.  Rehashes a lot of other people's ideas.  Not a lot of rigorous science behind his original thoughts.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Excellent book, very well researched & explained. I found myself nodding several times to instances I keep encountering in my professional & personal life. Now I found an explanation for why & how it happens. I definitely recommend this book.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book was recommended by a woman in book group.  She had read it and purchased copies for all of the teachers in her daughter's middle school.  Then she recommended it to our book group.  After reading it, I feel &#34;Wonder&#34; has timeless lessons for parents, teachers, kids and anyone who loves children.  Kindness never goes out of fashion and this book will emphasize that point.  I encourage all to read it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The last book of this series was the best of them all. It was hard to put down and I read it a little faster than I would have liked. Much better than the movie too might I add. :)
B002VPE1WK|3.0|I wanted to love this bag. Right out of the box, I did. It's one heck of a deal for the quality that it is, and better than anything you'll find on the shelf at your local big box retailers that will cost you double. If you've got a smaller SLR/DSLR and a couple of lenses some extra batteries and maybe a flash and an iPad, then look no further- you've found your \\"bang for the buck\\" bag right here. Bonus points for being rather plain looking as not to alert would-be thieves. If you've just bought a wonderful new DSLR kit to take better photos of your fam or whatnot, and you'd love to stuff a Klean Kanteen in here with some travel docs and be on your way for a day trip - THIS BAG IS FOR YOU. As for me...<br /><br />Look, I've read a TON of the reviews here, watched the videos, looked at the user photos, and ordered this bag with confidence that it would take the gear I need for a small shoot through a flight or two, and not bat an eye. Unfortunately, it didn't work out for me like it has for others, and the strap anchoring/stitching started to fail after a week of use. I could have just gotten a defective one, who knows.<br /><br />The more it was carried by the top strap through the streets of Chicago and the airport, the looser it got along with the right shoulder strap. From the user submitted photos, it seems others have stuffed WAY more gear in it than I had when I heard a stitch pop behind my right ear. At the time, I had about 12lbs of gear packed in: a battery gripped Canon 6D w/ 24-70/2.8 attached, Custom SLR C-Loop and strap (highly recommended, BTW), a flash + remote trigger, a 50mm/1.4, a lensbaby composer, some extra batteries and charger, an iPad w/cables, and a few extra accessories that weigh nothing (lenspen, stofen, mini bottle opener, pen, post-it notes, couple of lens cloths). I really don't know how some of the user photos here have actually stuffed this bag with 20+lbs of gear and had it hold up, but perhaps they got lucky and I didn't.<br /><br/>Just because this didn't work out for me doesn't mean that this bag is bad at all. It's fantastic, it's just not for my gear and usage, hence the 3 stars. So it's going back to Amazon, and I'm sucking up the cost of a Think Tank Photo backpack for travel.
034537410X|4.0|REALLY INTERESTING... DIFFERENT... VERY WELL WRITTEN... WOULD REFER THIS TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN DREAM CONTROL!  GLAD I FOUND IT... THANKS...
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Watch it if you enjoyed Pulp Fiction. Watch it if you can sit still for 2-1/2 hours. Watch it if you enjoy gore. Watch it even if you don't!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|It has so many options and on top of that we can define our custom schedule and timers.<br />It's Awesome Apps.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Excellent movie. Most don't realize it is a remake of an old classic.....Star studded cast...Dryfuss and Goodman make an incredible team....The chemistry between Holly and Dryfuss is amazing
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Very gripping and pwerful movie. Denzel had me on the edge of my seat every time he reached for a drink......Done do it!!!!!!
B00B0NDF26|4.0|Reminds me of the Go Gos. But a little less dramatic and more lively. Enjoyable and entertaining. Feels go to listen.
B00BU8RNCE|4.0|This film was called \\"The Impossible,\\" which was surely a perfect name.  Perfect, as it's hard to believe that people could be so impossibly civilized.  After all, it seemed that the meanest thing that anyone did here:  refuse to hand his phone over to Ewan McGregor so that Mr. McGregor could check in with his family back home.  I've seen people far less civilized in the checkout line at Safeway.<br /><br />But naturally, this film is probably broken into three standard acts, and luckily for us, we have act one -- which seemed impossibly realistic and amazing -- and the end of act three -- which redeems the film with some believability.  But act two is where it seemed the most impossible to me.<br /><br />For example, let's say that you're in a hospital.  In a faraway place.  And you don't know where your father/husband is, or where your other sons/brothers are.  Wouldn't you at this point spend any possible effort and time that you have searching for those people in your own family, instead of perhaps helping others -- others that you've never met, and will surely never meet again -- find members of their family?  But naturally, this is a movie so one of our main protagonists here searches a hospital, trying to reunite those strangers for no apparent reason, other than to play Haley Joel Osment in a reenactment of \\"Pay it Forward.\\"<br /><br />Believe me, I take no pleasure in finding any weakness in this weepy flick.  I'm a big fan of Naomi Watts -- who isn't? -- but this film should have been more balanced.  I wasn't even near the area where the tsunami killed a quarter of a million people almost a decade ago, but I didn't have to be to tell you the following:  in times of crises, people in general are at their worst.  Sure, you'll find a few heroes here and there.  But looting and crime are more likely, none of which we see here.<br /><br />But still, the opening act is worth the price of admission.  I could have watched that three times and been happy with the three or four bucks.  So I'll give this film a recommendation, even if most of it is, well, Impossible.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Can't believe this was cancelled after only 19 episodes, even though it won awards as best drama.  Claire Danes (Best Actress Winner for Homeland)  won same award for this at age 15.  The other teens were great as well.  Story lines are well-done and still hold up after almost 20 years.  Well worth the spend!!!
B00A17AD36|5.0|Got this album for $5.99!!!! 30 songs lots of bangers if ur into the weeknds music. Great album very much worth the money... must buy!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Enjoyed the superior storyline and incredible witting. Lets the reader have a birds eye view of their unfolding journey.  The end.
B0053O89IS|5.0|My granddaughter and I watch Bones whenever I babysit her and her brother.  She finds it fascinating, as do I, and it's a real moment of bonding for us.  Needless to say, I have her mother's permission to include her, but she's showing tendencies of becoming a forensic scientist herself, so it's not a bad thing.<br /><br />We have always loved the show on TV, and I now have all the seasons and can't wait for the next.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|My daughter loves this thing, which is the most important feature to me. I think it could be a little biggerto make it easier for a baby to hug. Also, I wish you could change out the pacifiers in order to clean them. I usually toss hers in the sterilizer at the end of the day.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I had always heard that this show was good and knew the actress, Julianna, had won awards for her character.  Wow! What an interesting drama.  Power to the strong female character! Acting is excellent and plot will grab you.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I enjoyed this from beginning to end.  Kathy Reichs always keeps me interested and unable to stop reading until the end.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I would give it 5 stars, but I really don't enjoy watching the lesbian scenes.  Truthfully and suggestion of sex is more than enough. The mind can fill in the blanks.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|At first I was a little bored, the guy in this book is not very bright.  But the author does a good job creating windows into who the guy used to be, and he's actually a much better person after a serious head injury, just not all there.  I was also intrigued because of the movie getting all those awards, and I can see why, there are many different well established relationships in the guy's life that deserve award winning performances, I'm sure the actors had a lot of fun playing these people.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This works really nicely. It has plenty of information to keep you informed of what's going on in your local and national weather.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|Terrible!<br />Even if you have no life, i urge you do not waste your time. If i thought i could sue for damages and opportunity time lost, i would.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Helps to pass time waiting in doctor's office. Keeps my mind from wandering.<br />No thinking needed, just need to keep fingers busy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved every page. So many twists were not expected, yet so perfectly as thy should be.<br />Highly recommend the trilogy.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a great story about an astronaut who is stuck on mars after a mission went awry.  GREAT story, and the main character is hilarious.  Definitely a strong \\"BUY\\" recommendation at twice the price.
B009RH973I|5.0|Great product for the price, was thinking of buying one for my son's tablet! Light, easy to use and protects my Kindle! Love the color! Recommend this product!
0817439390|5.0|As a newcomer to the world of DSLR photography, along with practice, practice, practice, I've been reading everything possible in an attempt to better my picture-taking skills.  After reading this book cover to cover while on vacation recently, the light finally came on.  I now have a very firm grasp of how to shoot in &#34;manual' mode and achieve the results I've been looking for.  This book is organized very well, extremely easy to understand and provides a wealth of tips and tricks around most everything one needs to know on basic fundamentals of photography.  A must-read for any newbie to photography!
B009AMANBA|5.0|I watched with a feeling I was actually there.  The real thing!  All the actors did a marvelous job of putting the viewer back in time while everything was happening.  So realistic!
B004UIOUHC|3.0|This browser is good but there are better ones out there which is why it has been replaced. But if there where no other browser with the capabilities it has, it would still be on my mobile device and it would be my main browser. As a tinkerer have to try all other browser that are out there and having more than two on there at the time it can get crowed. Recommend it to people that are looking for a good multiple tab browser that works well and is easy to use.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|Great CD....super quality....deliverd very fast. It was part of the rip and can be heard on line...great deal super price...well worth it....
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it!  Want to read more! Could not stop reading it. A truly captivating read. Will read the third book in this trilogy.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This series makes 2517 look good.  Perhaps we'll all be back around in another 500+ years and Nathan Fillion will still be young!
B008IEWBJ8|5.0|If you're a music lover, even if you don't like classic, please buy it! This is a must-have disc! I think Vivaldi also love this music.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|For the first video I was this franchise, this movie was very good actually. But the main character seemed sort of distant from the film.. She barely spoke. I was interested the entire time watching g this.. It held me in suspense at times and there was a fairly good amount of action
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Enjoyed the book, but I may take a break from Grisham for a while. Too much a patterned story line.
0007141874|5.0|A wonderful reminder of childhood, and still very much loved by the next generation. For anyone that loved Paddington as a child, this is a great book to read to your own children or grandchildren.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|A great continuation of the first volume. Leaves you excited to move on to the third to see what happens next.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Please everyone watch this show so that it can run for a proper length of time and be wrapped up properly. The show is intense and very well done. Characters are deep and the story never slows down
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Pleasantly surprised by this story! Author did an amazing job putting things in payments terms. Super fun read and very exciting!! A must read for sure!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Great unique game.  The game-play is perfect for a touch screen device, and it runs at a very calming pace.  I got it when it was free, but knowing what I know now, I'd say it would have been worth buying.
B00AIBZM40|5.0|Those of you saying that the ending was horrible DID NOT understand the ending.  (Of course, I won't spoil it.)  The character \\"Mama\\" is THE best movie ghost since \\"Samara\\" from The Ring.  Fantastic.  Ultra creepy.  Disturbing.  If a movie can actually scare me on some level, I love it because it's quite hard to do.  I was raised on horror.  This is good stuff.
B006HL9G10|5.0|If you want a timer with some peaceful alarm sounds, this one is great.  Though, I did get it when it was free, not sure I would pay for something that is just a cool timer.<br /><br />This also gives you a few extra notification sounds (assuming your phone recognizes that it has some new tones to choose from) I currently use one of the bowl effects for my texts, which is really most of the use I have gotten out of it.<br /><br />Pretty good product.  Great for what it is.  Five stars
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|It is engaging and not too difficult. I do wish it had had a more exciting ending. Give us a sequel!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Having seen all three seasons, I have to say this one is like 1 & 2, fantastic.A tremendous gathering of fine actors, great scenery<br />wonderful story lines , it all adds up to pure pleasure. A great comparison of the difference between rich and poor After seeing all 3 seasons you soon find you admire certain character and disliking others. .Excellent performances by all players. You may be disappointed in the loss of certain characters, but I guess that is real life. Grab all of these as soon as you can, you'll be<br />delighted you did.
B008EKON56|4.0|I picked this up in my quest for the best quality sound I could get for my new Harman Kardon CL headphones. Why anyone would get the version without the mini-usb connection to keep the iPod Touch charged is beyond me. I didn't get any signal pollution when charging while listening to music.<br /><br />Took off one star because, for some reason I cannot understand, certain songs sound like the gain is cranked up to distortion when using it in my car. Most songs it is fine, but certain ones just sound way overdriven. As a result, I just use the headphone jack in the car so I don't have to worry about it while driving.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Great it's really something. It's an amazing book everyone should read. It may not exciting but it sure has a meaning
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Love this movie. My kids love this movie. I think it's time we go watch it again and again and again...
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|A truly magnificent portrayal of Lincoln, both by Day-Lewis, and the writers.  Great acting all down the line of the cast.  Could not be better in any way.<br /><br />Jess Smith
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I never knew any thing about proper English ways and all that. The show has got me interested in British history.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found this very entertaining. I missed some sleep trying to find a place to stop reading.  Better than a movie because of the details.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I felt the second book was even better than the first. The love story aspect is as o romantic. Excellent.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Great insight to individuals with OCD.  Explores the cause of this partcular character&#34;s reason for it and how to deal with it.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|I play this game occasionally.  It's complicated because it takes a few tries with each set of tiles to figure out which tiles go with each other--many are quite similar to each other and I find it tiresome to see the minute changes between two similar-looking tiles.  I often need a hint to see  what my next move might be, because it's also difficult to detect which tiles are 'free' and which are still locked in, since they are stacked in 3-D form, and sometimes a tile is behind a stack, but is free.<br />It's definitely a challenge, and the idea that you can change backgrounds and sets of tiles keeps it interesting.  I'm not quite sure why I'm choosing the awards at the end.  There's no explanation of what ever happens with that part of the game.  In my mind, it's superfluous, but perhaps others need that extra gimmick after they win..
B0053O89YM|5.0|I own all three seasons of the Good Wife. I purchased all three of them from Amazon after comparing prices at Best Buy.  I like to purchase at Best Buy for the rewards program, but the cost was better through Amazon. The condition is perfect.  Can't wait for the Fourth season set.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|We have tried other microphones, several of which were over $100, and still had poor audio quality for our business videos, as our space to shoot our videos is in a basement that is all concrete. These microphones were recommended on a video production site, and we were very hesitant, as the price is so low in comparison. Wow....were we surprised! They are EXCELLENT! The sound is stable, not distorted, no popping, and with the long cord, can easily go directly into our Sony Handycam for ease of use. We are ordering several more!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|I was excited to see Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio in a Quinton Tarantino movie, but it never really excited me at any point. With these names on a movie I expected a lot more, maybe my expectations were set to high. It was alright but not the best.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Totally love this, nothing better than Nemo in all formats :o)  The colors, effects, and Dori are always a hit!
B007YJ8ZRK|4.0|Good It story line, kept me interested and excited. I definitely liked the movie and do recommend it to everyone.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Great game...but I can never visit friends....and the game doesn't even show up on my gameloft....but my gameloft friends show up on the game....sometimes...a few other glitches as well. I wouldn't recommend it until it's fixed.
B009GED3HS|2.0|Feels like they have told same stories like 4 times. There are some funny moments still bit for the most part this show has just gotten old. I just want to see it end, please let it end.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Americans should have appreciated this artist more.  His music was right with the times and I still enjoy it today.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Before I figured out how to use the parental controls, my then 4 year old son figured out how to turn on the Wifi on my Kindle Fire and ordered about $25 worth of games.  This was one of the games that he ordered.  It's cute, challenging, and totally worth the 99 cents.  I do not play it much, I usually watch my preschooler play it and wonder how the heck he figures out some of the levels!
B001TCHDPS|4.0|To bad Rodriguez slipped through the cracks of the music world.  Very talented and enjoy the CD.  I listen to it often.
0393343405|5.0|The tale of how a poem became a swerve that changed the world absolutely delighted me.  I bought a second copy for my son in law, who also loved the book.  This is great non-fiction.
B005OYKI1I|4.0|IF you are looking for nonstop action that involves cars this is definitely it.  I watched this movie getting ready to watch the next one.  By far one of the greatest.  Its like oceans 11 but for cars
B003CNQPNS|3.0|I am giving this series a 3-star rating because when I put in the DVD and watched the pilot episode, then the next 2 episodes, it was obvious this not what I expected.  It was like they made the DVD from the series that ran 1984 to 1985 without cleaning it up.  It looks and sounds like the original series I watched some 30 yrs ago on a TV then.  I am frankly surprised they didn't clean up the DVD series of the show and cleaned up the subpar picture quality and sound, much like they do with most TV box sets.  And only 13 episodes?  I had thought it had more episodes than that back in the mid 80's when I watched it with my dad when it was on primetime TV.  I have a feeling they cancelled the show in 1985 mainly because it had so much competition with other action series like Airwolf, Knight Rider, Miami Vice, CHiPs (even thought they cancelled the show in 1983) and TJ Hooker.  All were superior in contending with this show, and I own all the box sets of those shows.  Surprised they have only released TJ Hooker Season 1 and 2, and that was in 2005.  So far they haven't released more episodes and CHiPs is another letdown, 2 seasons so far and that's it.  Don't get me wrong I always loved Street Hawk, just disappointed I paid $27 for what looks like it was a direct port of the show instead of remastering it.  Really, the other shows were cleaned up and sound was excellent in terms of picture and sound quality.
B00BX85AZ8|5.0|I love anything Dido does and this CD is no exception. Classic Dido. Haunting melodies and her lovely voice. Any Dido fan will love this.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This was a great book. It was very inspiring. I cannot wait to try some of the recipes from the book.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I loved watching this show! so worth my time!!!!!!! i recomed it to anyone who wants to watch a history type shows
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|-- it's leaves you feeling super emotional and the movie is so breathtaking! Makes you wonder what happened to Richard Parker...<br />5 stars because it's such an amazing movie
B002BI6SMI|5.0|The first 20 minutes are just building the characters, then the shocker comes and from there it's non-stop.  It'll keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  Great movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire was  absolutely fabulous and I loved reading it. I'm so happy l read the hunger games and continued to complete the series. Thank you Suzanne Collins!
B005VPRET4|4.0|the downside would be that it didn't take my daughter very long to out this set together.  the upside is that it is a very cute playset and she has been playing with it for hours since completing it.  It has alot of cute details, she is already asking for more!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Super fun and addicting . My husband and I love to play this game. The graphics are great and the game is easy to my on my kindle fire.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I was new to this genre of fantasy books. Yes I have read the Tolkien and the Rowling, but nothing beyond that. It was accidental when I came across this book when surfing through for books in Amazon and noticed \\"A Quest of Heroes\\". Usually I wouldn't have cared, but I sampled it. That is when the frenzy weekend started. I was so involved in it that I finished all of the four books in 2 days time. All I did was eat and read. The way the characters were shaped were simply amazing and it is natural for a writer to devote his focus on the principal character. But I loved the way in which Morgan Rice made feel all the primary characters as important as Thor. I would recommend to everyone who like a emotionally bound fantasy literature.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|While Shin's story is a shock to the many who read it, it is nothing new to those left behind in similar places. One day our grandchildren will ask us why we didn't try harder to use our influences to change such wrongful treatment of our fellow humans. It is up to us to leave a legacy where history is not doomed to repeat itself.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I love these after owning them for years. I don't care what others say about Turtle Beach, they sound great, feel comfortable, and work great. The only thing that I wish is Microsoft would allow direct link's to it for the chat like Sony does, maybe the next gen will... but probably not, unless Microsoft makes one themselves.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King tells a very realistic fiction here.  I absolutely love his character development and the way he deals with trying to change time.  Multiple parts of the book had me teary-eyed and tangled up with nerves.  Best book I've ever read.
B003A9OVS0|5.0|This is by far, top 3 albums ever! I am biased in this, but i don't care. I love Plastic Beach! I loved Gorillaz older stuff, but this is amazing, even years later after it came out.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The graphics are great, but there is no speed control, just one. Little hard to maneuver the guy , and the monster chases him, over -tops him, where I can't see him.<br />Blocks me view. Like I can change the sharpness of my graphics but hoping it gets easier .
B0088O11NU|4.0|The first time I played this was on a friends phone and I liked it then. I am happy to be able to play when I want to now.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Maria's vocals are on point, her screams are powerful, and the lyrics are emotional and visually descriptive. They have amped up the guitar work to more precise and pounding levels. Certainly a more produced sound than their earlier entries, but they are evolving into a more powerful and influential band.<br /><br />Whether you are a fan of their aggressive sound (listen to &#34;Blood&#34; and &#34;Comanche&#34;), or the quieter and surreal building of Maria's vocals to a fevered pitch (try &#34;Whore&#34; and &#34;11:11&#34;),  this album should entertain previous fans and new ones alike.
B001661RC2|5.0|I love them album as much as the other ones. More of the keys as you know them with more tunes. A great buy! I rock this out all the time
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I remember when it was on years ago, but didn't watch it. So glad I ordered.  It has been great!<br /><br />I really do with Amazon would allow subtitles though.  Hard of hearing and have to BLAST the sound.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|This autobiography is a hard read and it's not because of the big words.  After dragging through 8 or 10 chapters I decided that Mr. Kyle should keep his day job. Though I commend his sacrifice, I just got sick of the constant reaffirmation of what a bad-ass he thought he was. I would hope that a majority of America's elite warriors would be more from the Sun Tzu (The Art Of War) persuasion than from the school of WWF. I have read that Mr. Kyle has recently met an untimely and somewhat ironic end and that is a shame but probably the only reason I made it 8 chapters.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|I'm really enjoying Gangstar Rio: City of Saints for the Kindle, the storyline is good, the upgrade with the new version is even more fun with the new car's, gun's, and mission.
B0098VXDDS|5.0|Gratitude to the writers and producers of this show.  Apologies for the length of my review, but Spartacus was a man of few words...and so am I.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Easy to read, Mark Cuban writes in a straight forward and compelling style.  His ideas are broken down in an easy to follow format, and many ideas anyone who is interested in their own business will be able to reference.  The book left me hungry for more, I would highly recommend it as one of your cornerstone reference points
B0095H4FAA|5.0|The Millennium Trilogy, of which The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is book #1 is one of the best series I have ever read. Lisbeth Salender is the most intoxicatingly addictive character I have ever read. Probably, I feel this way because Lisbeth is so gifted and at the same time so vulnerable. The books are very strong in character development and the development of relationships between different people, businesses and groups. For example, Vanger Corporation,  Milton Security and Lisbeth's government guardian organization.  The reader doesn't really know what's happening until the third book.  It is no wonder that these books were so successful around the world.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This is a very moving, sad and tragic accounting of the difficulties of growing up poor and Irish in the pre and post WWII years.  It is extremely well written.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This book was exciting enough that i just wanted to keep reading. I especially enjoyed the afterword describing how the author gets her ideas.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Because I so wasn't paying attention. I will watch this movie again and again and I still. Won't. Care. Great dancing... &#60;sigh&#62;
B00C0NFMKI|4.0|First time I listened to this album, I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have the same elements from Riot and Brand New Eyes. Then, I listened to the album a few more times and found myself really enjoying this evolution of their music style. My favorite songs from this album are: Anklebiters, Grow Up, Part II, Still Into You and all of the Interlude titled tracks.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about purchasing the album, I would recommend listening to the tracks a few times because this is a change from the previous albums. I think that you'll find, like me, this is a purchase you won't regret making.
B003XX2PD6|2.0|I am kind of disappointed by thi cd.I heard the song Helicopter on Alt nation, on Sirius satellite radio & just on heaing that song  decided to buy the cd.Th rest of the cd  just fell apart & the quality of the rest of the songs just was not as good in my opinion
B000N4SHOE|4.0|this was an enjoyable movie for the spring time.  I had not known the story about Miss Potter and enjoyed it very much.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I found this book after reading a couple of book from Sanford's Kidd series and I was glad I did. Mr Russinovich has not only a very good writing style which made it hard for me to put down the book but he knows his computers. Today, in this day and age where so many people are on the Internet, I can't believe there aren't more novels out there like this. Sure, others mention computers or the Internet but I can't find books, well...books like this one where not only is the crime often commited via computer or Internet but the author knows enough about the tech end to keep everyone interested. I know computers and I loved the tech. Mr Russinovich went into details that I loved reading about. A co-worker I recommended this book to knows next to nothing about computers and he loved it as well. The author has hit a home run here in my opinion.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|see the movie first because if you see it after you will be disapointed by it!!!!!!!<br />they leave so many things out that you will cry all over again when you read the book!!!!!!!!!!<br />getting teary eyed thinking about it!!!!!!!!!!! if your looking for a ball you eyes out book (and movie if you watch it first) you have found it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is an excellent narrative of the challenges faced by many organizations in understanding how to manage service and provide value to their customers.  It is done in a way that is both entertaining and informative.  It is not an IT book, it is a business must have.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|There was so many mixed emotions in this boo. You can really relate to the characters and I love to learn so much about each of them. There was some extreme surprises throughout the book! It's just amazing!!!
1595825045|5.0|Definately worth it. A good read that I found myself unable to put down. & artwork that truly blows your mind away. & makes you appreiciate how hard this show was worked on. Great book to keep out & on display.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app it helps me read at night when I whant to read my bible. It also is a good app for my swans program at church if I forget my Bible.  This is an good app.
0061950726|5.0|I loved this book, almost from its opening pages.  What function as somewhat parallel stories, related stories, \\"Orphan Train\\" is peopled with characters that you will come to love and care for, and, as harsh as the circumstances often are, wish for them the very best of outcomes.  Christina Baker Kline's previous book, \\"A Bird In Hand,\\" was a Vine selection some while ago.  I enjoyed it but I love this story so much more.  \\"Orphan Train\\"...there were such, and over many years they brought in excess of 200,000 homeless children of varied ages to stops along the way in the Midwest and far West, in the hopes of finding homes for them.  Didn't seem to matter whether the homes turned out to be good homes; rather it was almost an effort to remove orphans from the scene, scatter them, often without any care or concerrn as to the circumstances into which they might be taken.  \\"Orphan Train\\" is a beautifully realized story, moving us back and forth in time from the late 1920's Minnesota to 2011 Maine, back and forth as the pages unfold.  Most memorable, of course, will be our interaction with Niamh (later to be named Vivian) and Molly, Niamh an immigrant girl, who, through circumstances, comes to be on the orphan train, Molly a girl of the present, about to \\"age out\\" of foster care.  The paths of these two characters cross just when perhaps both need the other the most.  You'll be pulled into this relationship and Vivian's incredible story, perhaps finding, as I did, that the book was impossible to put down.  This is a memorable piece of writing, a lovely novel of which author Baker Kline can be so proud.  She cloaks her history lesson in a tale that will move you, sometimes anger you, but always inspire you as roads, by chance, are taken by these characters, leading them to the book's lovely conclusion.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle Fire to keep track of three different calendars and it has worked wonderfully! It is very easy to add, edit, and remove things from your schedule both online and offline. I would highly recommend to people with busy schedules and people with more than one schedule to keep track of!
B00BS4QP60|5.0|Even with the silly songs, this CD has great depth. I really can't get enough of Mr. Blake Shelton! Love.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that temple run 2 is a lot better than 1 and it is.... FREE. So I would get this game<br />By Jaren
B00275EHJG|5.0|This wraps up the adventures of Andy's toys in an exciting, entertaining way. If you love Toy Story, you will definitely love this movie. Well worth watching!
B003B02OQ4|5.0|No disappointment here.  John Grisham just has a way with words that keeps you wanting more.  Love his books!!  What am I gonna do when I run out of John Grisham!!
B001EU79F4|5.0|This is one of the most incredible albums I have ever heard. I am unsure of how it did on the charts when it came out but I am sure it was underrated. Definitely one to have with you if you were stranded on a deserted island.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Most informative in the least amount of screens and spacing. Ideal for weather information and more. Straightforward navigation and customization is great.
B000054BF2|5.0|dude, this album is rocking and stuff. really good for making your turntable sound better than it normally does. highly recommend.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|This album is great for a person with so many emotion like myself one min I am soft spoken the next I am dark and wild and she hits every aspect of that in this album. They are a talanted band and work well to bring the album alive!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|God's word goes with me now, wherever I go!<br />I can listen to , I can read it , and be reminded daily of HIS goodness, hope & promise
0525951652|4.0|As I have said, this book was not as memorable but I may re-read it.  I read so much that that is sometimes necessary in order to fully absorb it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I am late in having any interest in this Trilogy. I watched The Hunger Games once it left theaters. I didn't enjoy it the first time I watched it. I put my initial reservations aside and watched it a second time and was able to enjoy Katniss' personality and cleverness. I agree much of that was missing in Mockingjay. I really was not a Katnniss fan by the end of Mockingjay. I also agree that the way Gales's personality changed seemed out character.<br />I do think she loved her children. However, I think she waited so long to have children because she was afraid the past might repeat itself. I skipped reading Catching Fire but now have no desire to read it.
B0095P31L6|5.0|This was a great, funny movie for adults and kids.  There was enough adult humor disguised in the dialog that would not require explanation for kids.  Must watch
1595827684|3.0|The book itself is nice and the pages are thick to prevent tearing. The content how feels lacking. There is not as much development art and commentary on how the series could have gone or ideas the staff was having that I hoped for. However I consider it worth my money and would say that if you can't get enough ME this is the art book for you.
0061537969|5.0|This book, which is written by a dog, is one of the most interesting and thought provoking books.  As a long time dog lover and owner, I now look at dogs in a whole new light.  It is a story you will long remember.  You will laugh, cry and think, all thru the book.  Highly recommended...
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Great show.  It was funny and entertaining and a fun show for the family.  I highly recommend it.<br />Cute characters and heart warming too.

B0002VL0KQ|5.0|Celine Dion has a beautiful voice, and this is a CD of lullabies sung by her.  It is lovely to listen to.
B001XUPGLY|5.0|In my opinion, the best of the six movies. All the elements of the original that we know and love. If you only want to see one, this is it.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|While it was a good book, I found myself wanting things to move along. I was surprised that by the end of the second book only one more girl had been eliminated. I thought the twists and turns were interesting but still think she should have wrapped it up.
B001XUT6AG|4.0|This story ties the old with the new. Predictable in many spots and it can be summed up in a few words... It's Trek!
B003MC5N28|5.0|Wonderfully written book. Keeps you on your toes and continues to make you think. I never wanted to put it down or for the book to end.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I MISSED SEEING THIS AT THE THEATER. WENT TO PRE-ORDER & THERE'S NO 3D/2D COMBO? I WANTED TO AT LEAST SEE 3D ONCE...THEN WOULD REWATCH THE 2D. WE JUST GOT A NEW 3D TV & 3D BLU-RAY PLAYER, BUT NOT EVERYONE IS THRILLED WITH 3D WATCHING. NOT TO MENTION WE DON'T HAVE ANY 3D'S YET & OTHER ROOMS IN THE HOUSE HAVE ONLY DVD PLAYERS & BLU-RAY PLAYERS & REGULAR TV'S. I DON'T KNOW IF I GOING TO BUY THIS NOW. I PROBABLY WILL JUST RENT THE BLU-RAY FROM REDBOX. TO BAD REDBOX DIDN'T RENT 3D'S THAT WOULD SOLVE A PROBLEM. I'M NOT HATING ON THE MOVIE JUST GREEDY DISNEY. I'M SURE I'LL LOVE THE MOVIE.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I'm a huge Lord Of The Rings fan, I've been watching each movie for years, The Hobbit does not disappoint, and I'm really glad they brought back Gollum which is my favorite character of the whole movie, the story and action is great.<br /><br />But try to keep this franchise mature, you'll ruin it if you try to make this appeal to kids.

B009YU6FJM|5.0|At age 14, I bought my first Deftones album: White Pony, in 2000. From that moment on, all seven of their albums have graced my collection. Koi No Yokan, in particular, captivated me all over again; I felt that same &#34;geeked&#34; feeling as a teenage freshman in school, wearing out that CD in my Walkman like it was the only one I owned.  Chino and the boys out-due themselves in the most awesome way and reaffirm to the world that even till this day, they are still the same pioneers from SACTO.<br /><br />Thank you Chino, Abe, Stephen, Frank and Sergio; R.I.P Chi Cheng; life changers and keepers of the sanity.
B009A87Z6U|3.0|When I was growing up the new bond movie meant more than end of school. Please understand this is not a bad rating for the movie, very good action. I just don't like the actor who played bond as much as the past 007's it was always an adjustment when they changed but the new actor doesn't do the in the public eye gala evens as well as the past bonds. This is my opinion only the movie was a good action show.

B002N5N5LG|2.0|I liked the show at first but I very quickly grew tired of the Meg Griffin style &#34;Everyone hates this one female character for no reason!&#34; thing and Joel McHale is only funny when he isn't forced to display human emotion. What he does best is heartless snark and they shouldn't try to make him learn lessons. Also... the weird romance between him (30+) and the 18 year old nerd girl is... uncomfortable to say the least.

B006JPS1OM|4.0|This is an ok hidden objects game. It was free so that is definitely a plus. I am giving four stars because it's a free game that is decent, not an easy find.
B0085Z3B2Q|4.0|The parts of this movie that follow the story from the book are hilarious and awesome. Ed Helms is fantastic, the graphics look amazing and the interaction between the Onceler and the Lorax is perfect. The parts that they added in with the kid and the girl he has a crush on are awkward and boring. They ought to make a cut of the film with all that stuff taken out, I'd buy that for sure.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I saw the movie and wanted to know more of what the author was driving at.  It is a very interesting perspective of what a world could be like, or is the author comparing it to something that already exists in our worlds we just don't want to see it.  It would make a great discussion series.  As always the movie misses even though the movie was very good.  I am reading the second book and I can't wait to read it daily, it has really captured my attention.  The author is doing a great job of continuing on the plot of the series.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|This album really hits the mark.  It seems like they have really figured out what they did right with the last album and then capitalized on that.

B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I really enjoy this fast paced RTS game. The graphics are not that good but the game play is very fun and easy to understand but hard to master.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to understand basics<br />Good interface with little lag<br />Can be quite challenging (I don't know about you but I like a bit of a challenge in strategy games)<br />Playable with players not just computers.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Just so you know:<br />This game has a steep learning curve. Its very easy at first but there is an extreme difference between a player who has played it for 15 minutes and 15 days. Take my advice and play verse computers first.<br /><br />I simply love this game, Over the last week I have downloaded 40 some odd games and only kept 2 this is one of the 2 and I don't see myself getting bored of it any time soon. Take my advice and get the free copy at least you will be hooked :)
B000QJM8Z0|4.0|I read this book a few years ago and had to re-read it.  It is funnier than the movie, if that is possible, and since I own the movie and watch it frequently I can speak from authority! Great read for &#34;singletons&#34; everywhere!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I really enjoy this game as it has seamless graphics and game play it kind of reminds me of diablo 3. But be warned if you don't want to spend money you need patience enough to let things finish on there timers. As such this is still a great game even if you don't want to pay it will just give you a competitive disadvantage.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Its free! At least for the initial game.<br />Great graphics.<br />Good selection of characters.<br />Solid game play.<br />Intuitive controls.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Takes a very large chunk of data, almost a gig. This means you have to wait quite a while to play it.<br />Has an in app market where you can buy stuff for real money so beware.<br /><br />Overall I encourage anyone who enjoys RPG's to get this game as its a very addictive must have.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|This performance was amazing!  I adored every minute and my kids' eyes were glued to the television the whole time!  We highly enjoyed this movie and plan on seeing these performers live now!  Can't wait!!!

B007ZXK08C|4.0|Amy Dunne disappears on her fifth wedding anniversary. Naturally the police suspect her husband, Nick of being involved. Both Nick and Amy are very convincing liars. He is also a cheat and Amy is a manipulative, narcissistic sociopath. Neither of them are very likeable. This is a dark, fast paced thriller except for the ending. The book just petered out to an unsatisfactory finish. That said I did enjoy it. It is full of plenty of twists and turns and I am looking forward to reading this authors's other novels.

B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Intense movie weighing heroism against addiction. Denzel Washington is fabulous, as usual. Nudity and drug use definitely make this an adults-only movie.
B004L9MFM2|3.0|Not as gripping as the first book in the series.  I found this quite difficult to read at times as it moves along very slowly towards the major battle sequence.  Overall, okay, but takes some effort to read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Even though there is no superflat, hardcore, fish, wolves, ocelot, enderman man, the end, or Redstone, it is pretty neat. Did you know that this one was the first to have quartz? Or stone cutters? Probably. The only thing I hate is that that there is no buckets or iron doors or you can't summon Herobrine, but other than that, it's great! 5 STARS!!
B002R88G5E|5.0|Truly a must read! Another gripping story from Khaled Hosseini, this time following the life of a young Afghan girl.  Similarly to his previous book, The Kite Runner, this is a book I could not put down and one that conjures a great deal of sadness, but hope at the same time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love it, very good, accurate, and timely, you won't be disappointed. Buy it and get rid of the adverisements. You'll ove it.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|A great way to get addicted to the book series and this first book does a very good job of introducing all of the major characters.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|This is a very fun game. The problem is that for a \\"free\\" game, you actually get a very limited amount of \\"free\\" play. Once that is used up you either have to PAY for gold which can be used to get more lives or wait several minutes for lives to slowly accrue so you can play again. You can also get \\"free\\" lives by sharing your Facebook information with the game, but again, that is not really \\"free\\".<br /><br />If I originally knew of all the strings attached to actually playing this \\"free\\" game, I would not have wasted my time downloading and installing it.

The characters were so unlikeable . But at the end I wanted to know what happens further do they kill each other or what, just crazy. I kept thinking how is she going to end this book, that is why I did not give 5 stars, the ending was awful, was she sitting us up for more, or trying to be clever or hey was it just amazing crazy Amy getting the last word, you all know how she is, wink, wink.

0812993845|3.0|I've read a lot of Sophie Kinsella books. Some I've enjoyed. Others I've found tedious. Even though I adored Confessions of a Shopaholic--enough to read the whole series, even after I stopped loving them--my main complaint was that the main character, Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) never progressed. She never seemed to learn anything or mature, no matter how much older she got or how much her life changed. After a while I just wanted to scream, \\"Why can't Sophie Kinsella create a female character who exercises some common sense rather than just being delightfully ditsy all the time?\\" It became maddening to read about characters in their thirties who had all the romantic foibles of a twenty-year-old.<br /><br />In Wedding Night, it seems Sophie Kinsella is addressing some of that very frustration. The character of Lottie (who is to have the eponymous wedding night) is a classic Kinsella character, pushed to the edge of likability. She's irrational, impulsive, obsessed with her romantic relationships but completely incapable of assessing them correctly, she has no self-awareness, she implodes with every emotional hiccup and loses touch with reality at an alarming rate. When her boyfriend fails to propose at dinner (a \\"failure\\" only in the sense that Lottie had invented an elaborate scenario in which he did propose, totally unbeknownst to him), she crumples and flies into the arms of an ex-lover, impulsively agreeing to marry him (WHY??). She's a lot to take, even for a Kinsella character.<br /><br />The difference in this book is that the author seems to know this character is annoying. Enter Fliss. She's Lottie's sister and she's been putting up with Lottie's crap for years. Plus she's a grown up with her own problems. She's divorced, has a job that she seems to take seriously, and worries about making ends meet. She doesn't have time to keep trying to put Lottie's romantic life back together for her. (Oh wait, yes she does.)<br /><br />At first it seems that Fliss is a foil to Lottie, that she serves as a contrast to show the reader what it would look like if a Kinsella character was not perpetually in a state of arrested development. Unfortunately it turns out that a character like that is pretty darn depressing and unpleasant. Besides, for all her maturity and wisdom, she still ends up spending the rest of the book trying to sabotage her sister's wedding night (for her own good, insists Fliss) with elaborate shenanigans.<br /><br />I'm starting to think that the problem isn't just with Sophie Kinsella's writing or characters. She's a competent writer in her genre. But I think her books have a shelf life. You have to read them by the time you're 25 or you may not enjoy them as much. If you've already learned all of the basic life lessons that her characters seem incapable of grasping (like foresight, logic and simple communication skills) you'll probably just find her heroines annoying and inconsequential.<br /><br />Of course maybe it's just me. I don't know why I keep reading her books, quite frankly. I get so excited every time a new one comes out, hoping to replicate the enjoyment I had of the first three Shopaholic books. But none of the other ones have measured up. I think it's time for me to cut my losses and relegate Sophie Kinsella to the category of \\"authors I liked in the past but have simply outgrown.\\" She can hang out with Stephen King and Gordon Korman.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a digital galley of this book free from Edelweiss (Above the Tree Line). I was asked to write an honest review, though not necessarily a favourable one. The opinions expressed are strictly my own.a foil to Lottie, that she serves as a contrast to show the reader what it would look like if a Kinsella character was not perpetually in a state of arrested development.

B00003CWNR|2.0|If you were forced to find meaning in this film, you'd say, \\"Break the rules. It's a good thing.\\" But the values surrounding rule-breaking are weakly presented, and no one who watches the film comes away with an epiphany about rule-breaking. Just read the reviews. People love the film for its sentimentality--the plight of its orphans and the love of those tending to them. The orphans are very sympathetic and life in the orphanage is portrayed in a compelling way. Which has nothing to do with violating rules against abortion, or cheating on your boyfriend, or father-daughter incest, which are the rule-breaking situations the film visits in its vain search for meaning. Nothing in the film works, except for the sentimentality.
B00881PTRC|4.0|I have to say I love this app totally worth a dollar. The. graphics are outstanding and the hangman is funny glad I was able to get it for the FAOTD but I would of paid for it no problem.
1451695195|5.0|I originally purchased the audio version of the book for my Kindle, and I really liked hearing the story in the author's own voice.  I had told my friends and family about the story, and they immediately wanted to read it too...so I purchased the paperback book, so they could pass it around.  It is a remarkable story and I liked the way it unfolded, giving us enough background to see how all the characters intertwined, as well as the facts that authenticated the &#34;proof&#34; of the experience.  It was soooo interesting!
0316056863|2.0|Got about 1/3 of the way through the book and lost interest. Didn't find it that funny or engaging.  Maybe it needed an Alec Baldwin for the comedy to work or something, but if you're a fan of Tina Fey, I would recommend sticking with episodes of 30 Rock.

B0061TQBRK|3.0|If you're feeling nostalgic for Linkin Park or Evanescence, then this is a great CD for you.  It's about as dark, about as heavy, and about as catchy.<br />However, if you're like me and you value more complex composition, then this probably won't be for you.  Or if you're like me, and you don't like the direction Lacuna Coil has gone since the release of their CD Karmacode, then prepare yourself for another bitter disappointment.<br />In order to understand the disappointment that is this CD, let me provide you with a brief history of this band.  Lacuna's first two CDs relied upon a softer, more melodic sound.  The melodies they created were unique and hauntingly beautiful. By the time their third CD Comalies came around, there were still remnants of that sound, but there were a lot more \\"heavier\\" tracks.  I still liked these.  In Comalies, there were still those soft songs that were hauntingly beautiful.  With their next CD, Karmacode, there were a lot less of them.  Karmacode also tried to have a lot more energy to it. Unfortunately, Lacuna Coil this doesn't work well because their guitarist doesn't seem to be skilled enough to play fast or use too many different chords at a time. And then they started receiving more commercial attention.  Then there was Shallow Life, which was produced by Don Gilmore.  Don Gilmore has produced CDs by Linkin Park, and it shows with what sound Lacuna Coil was trying to achieve with this release.  The tracks were a lot more watered down, more radio friendly, and appealed more to the Hot Topic crowd.<br />And then we come to this.  The haunting melodies have disappeared.  There was one softer track called End of Time. I found this track to be too bland and uninteresting to listen to.  It felt like the obligatory soft song bands like Linkin Park have to put on their CDs to make them sound deep, and had none of the qualities that made their other softer tracks work.<br />All the other tracks have the heavier sound and energy of Karmacode.  I found I actually enjoyed the single from this CD, Trip the Darkness, which convinced me to buy this CD.  I really like how lead singer Cristina Scabbia sings the chorus of this song.  I heard another song from this CD, Kill The Light, which although not as good also convinced me to give this CD a shot.  What I noticed about these two tracks was how outstanding Cristina's vocals are.  There is definitely something unique about her voice, and it seemed to really come out in these tracks.<br />Then I bought the CD.  I wish I would have listened to the other tracks as well.  Unfortunately these two tracks, along with the track Intoxicated were the only ones I really enjoyed on this CD.  The other ones felt very sloppy.<br />One thing I didn't like about Shallow Life and that I also don't like about this CD is that the lyrics are a lot more straight forward.  In their earlier releases, the lyrics were not as important as the composition.  The lyrics weren't very straight forward and I couldn't make sense of a lot of them, which, when used with the composition and Cristina Scabbia's fantastic vocals made Lacuna Coil's songs seem more otherworldly to me.  They weren't trying to be \\"gothic\\" back then, it just was a natural result of their hauntingly beautiful sound.  Now the lyrics are in the foreground, and they are more stereotypically \\"gothic\\" in the same vein as an Evanescence song.  I could sum up a lot of the lyrical themes of the songs on this CD with \\"I'm so dark and I like dark things!\\"<br />Another thing that seems to annoy me and a lot more other fans is the other singer Andrea Ferro's voice.  I like this band (despite how negative this review is), but to be honest, I really don't care for his voice and I understand how this often prevents otherwise interested fans in listening to this band.  He mostly shouts when he sings, his range is extremely limited,and he often goes out of tune.  He was more in the background with earlier releases, but he has a lotmore parts in Karmacode, Shallow Life, and now this CD. Sometimes it feels like Cristina is fighting hard to restore the quality of the song in the chorus after Andrea took a massive dump on it during his first and second verse.<br />To make a long story short, if you like dark music that has some kind of an otherworldly quality and beautiful composition, don't purchase this.  You have other options.  If you already have this CD or have heard it and don't like it, don't judge this band by this release for they have done far, far better.
B002ZBT84G|5.0|Sounds at times like the album Ralph Ellison's invisible man would have made. At times claustrophobic, brutally honest. The spoken gruf of what remains of Heron's voice is accented ever so slightly with Richard Russell's production choices. Such emphasis makes you lean in a little to listen to Heron's often ominous tone as he retells his life story. Highlights include \\"Me and the Devil,\\" a cover of Robert Johnson's classic \\"Me and the Devil Blues\\"

B007THA4FI|4.0|While not at all like the Harry Potter novels, this book provided a good story and kept me in suspense.  I found myself anxious to keep reading about the continued drama in the little town of Pagford and to follow the emotions and decisions of its inhabitants.  Our book club is reading the book this month, and I have been excited to talk to the other members about the story!
0061692034|2.0|I thought this book was boring.  A whole book about one bank robbery - and not much else - what happened to Berner (or whatever her name was)
B000UIVRXG|4.0|I depend on those guys for the movies to add to my library. Often when reviewing movies, they recommend similar and better ones. In their review for Your Highness I believe the mention this movie. As for this movie itself, I have seen it twice so far, ready to watch it again when I get the chance. What impressed me most were the characters--well writen and well executed. I enjoyed all the music and movie references worked in; if overt, it was also endearing, otherwise used subtly and sparingly. If you enjoy buddy movies, police movies, or satire, I recommend it.
B00AMUOP22|5.0|This song rocks!!  I am a huge fan of Will.i.am and the Black-Eyed Peas, and this song has his stamp all over it.  I love the addition of Britney, and find the whole song a ton of fun.  I just ordered the 2-track CD of this single, and I am totally looking forward to receiving it from Switzerland.  The only copies that were available to purchase on Amazon were being shipped from Europe so that's kind of interesting.  BUY THIS!!! You are going to enjoy it!

I have seen Les Miserables on Broadway three times, and I would EASILY say this is just as good as any of those performances.  With the thrill of seeing a live-performance aside, I would even dare to say it is better!  Can I give any higher praise than that?!  If you have a great surround set-up, then you owe it to yourself and your family to purchase this film.<br /><br />Tom Hooper made one of the most brilliant decisions when directing this film - to have the actors sing each number as they acted, rather than to dub their performances with studio music afterwards.  I CANNOT STRESS how much this impacted the film in a positive way, and I cannot believe other directors have not utilized this in the past.  I was skeptical about having prominent actors such as Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe cast into such well-known singing roles, but I believe they did an exceptional job.  Russell Crowe's singing may have been the weakest in terms of solo performances, BUT his acting is EXTREMELY powerful for the role.  In the end, I found that I really believed him as Javert and appreciated the fact that he was chosen for the cast.  He serves as a fantastic foil for Jackman's Jean Valjean.<br /><br />If you don't like musicals, then even a stellar film such as this will not change your perception.  But if you do, let me tell you that this is a movie that is powerful beyond words.  The staging, casting, color saturation, cinematography, singing and instrumentation are simply off the charts.  Samantha Barks's rendition of \\"On My Own\\" is better than any of the three Broadway shows I have seen, and Eddie Redmayne did a standout job as Marius.  I was moved to tears several times, and felt like giving a standing ovation following the film - and this is from my living room, watching the movie by myself with surround sound.  I am not a sentimental person either.  Wow!  Jeez..I'm still reeling with shock from how fantastic everything was - right up to the final chorus.<br /><br />I urge you to view this movie for yourself, and to see it through from start to finish.  This is not simply another rendition of Les Miserables, it is THE BEST rendition of Les Miserables.  If you are not a believer by the final note, then you may want to consult a local audiologist to test your hearing.  I am so happy I decided to buy this instead of rent, because it is a movie for the ages!<br /><br />\\"This one goes to 11\\"/10
0439023491|1.0|Like my title says, the Hunger Games was okay, but this was the worst book I've ever read. It took me so long to finish because it was so boring. I know, I know, if I don't like it then why read it and review about it? Everyone else was reading it, so I did, too, but I'm not even going to try to read Mockingjay because people say that that's the most boring one. How much worse could it get? These characters live in a society that can never happen. Ever. It's one thing when it's believable that the future isn't a good thing, but when we start to kill our own children? Wow. Way to go Suzanne Collins. Hmmm... I think I'll write a book about brutally killing society's future one by one until some survive and get money for it. Great idea.
6305892806|3.0|Love the lead actress, cast, sets and dialogue but after all this young woman goes through, I was super bummed out we did not see her actually marry her dearest love!  For heaven's sake- what writer would remove this key element from a dramatic romance?  The main character suffers cruelly as an outsider her whole life and when the one she truly loves finally wakes up and confesses he loves her?  He does not marry her properly in a church in a wedding!  Instead, the story ends right there.  What's up with that! We in the romance dept demand our money back!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I thought people were crazy for watching a movie about teenagers killing teenagers, but really, you have to watch it. You fall in love with the characters - I had to read the books after I watched it. I can't wait for the rest of the movies.

B001FVV2X2|5.0|It's been a long time since X Files was last on the air. Fringe is a really fun show filled with intrigue and interesting mysteries. The performances by the main cast are usually really solid. I highly recommend this show.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|As a 40-something who watched and loved this when it first came out, imagine the thrill my wife and I got when we realized we could watch it through Amazon Instant Video with our three kids! It was very easy to purchase, ran flawlessly on our laptop (hooked into our HDTV via HDMI), and we even paused it for a bathroom break.<br /><br />Still a great movie. Very age appropriate and we intend to rent the &#34;follow on&#34; movies, as well.
B00542UMIY|5.0|This was a great movie for the whole family!  I would recommend this movie for all to see.  Thank you

B005UBNKWO|5.0|I bought this with my new gaming rig. I couldn't be happier. Six cores for $110! I was going to get an i5 which was 4 cores for $200. If your on a budget for gaming or just need a budget processor you should seriously consider this chip. Thank you for reading and hope this helps.
0374531269|4.0|A long way gone: Memoirs of a boy soldier by Ishmael Beah is a touching and equally sad book. Ishmael Beah gave a vivd account on his tragic early childhood. This book depicts some of the terrible and personal impacts of globalization. Ishmael grew up in a war torn part of Africa, Sierra Leone, which happens to be a large mining territory. Although it is not directly stated in the book, Sierra Leone is a large producer of gold, titanium, diamonds, and more. Despite the high prevalence of expensive minerals, the country is overwhelmingly poor, as depicted in the book. There was a fight for resources, between the rebels and the current government of the time. The rebels attacked every village possible causing a reign of terror amongst the poor and ill prepared villagers. Ishmael gives a personal account on running from these rebels who sweep the nation attempting to take over every area they can. The poor boy, and many others, witness death firsthand, finding bodies and blood everywhere they go. As hard as Ishmael and the others try to escape the rebels and avoid they war they are eventually caught. They were forced into the governments army and manipulated into mindless drones. The young boys were taught to kill for fun, it was even turned into a competition. Ishmael got lucky during various parts of the book and was narrowly saved from death. This book is a must read because it is a big eye opener, especially for those studying globalization. The greed that globalization has brought has lead to terrible things. A country with rich resources was being taken advantage of, leaving the majority of the country desperate. In times of despair some people will do anything to live and get by. Whether it be killing in an army like poor Ishmael or the rebels trying to seize the country one mining town at a time.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very good book, once you start to read it, it's hard to put it down. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the truth about a soldier's life.
B000MZHW1S|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. My old copy would not play, and this one does. Still love my HDDVD player, and wish it would have beat bluray. HDDVD was a much better format.
B000GCFO08|5.0|This movie is evil, right from hell. It is about a mother looking for her daughter, whom, in the hands of the devil's daughter. But, even as the mother finds her daughter, the devil's seed is still inside of her daughter. What will happen next, to this little girl?
B00CBRH4YU|3.0|It was a subliminal, non-physical movie. the characters weren't really there, but their essence was, their spirit. They bumped into each other, danced with each other occasionally, but their orbits never quite collapsed completely into one another. The wordlessness of the picture was, at times, it's greatest strength; the scenes shot as expressions of the inner anxieties and depressions of the people. Natural metaphor is everywhere, and even if it is at best a shallow portrayal of the people which inhabit the film, their archetypes reach into all of us. we've all been there before.
B009K0P10K|4.0|It does not come through clear.  down load it not loud enough.  it is the same with all your product, I have down loaded and paid for.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Everything was perfect! I got the CD in a timely fashion. I would recommend this because you get the digital copy as well.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It's okay, not much to say.  I don't play it much.  again with the words required this silly. ok ok
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|I'm starting to get interested in stocks and was looking for an app that I could track stocks with. Bloomberg keeps you updated on all the events that take place during the day that could affect stocks. And it lets you pick any stock you want to keep an eye on. So for example if you want to track Amazon's stock this app will keep you updated on any activity involving Amazon. It's great and easy to use even for a beginner like me and best of all it's free. I recommend this app for anyone who is thinking about becoming interested in the stock market.
B00881PTRC|5.0|The animation is cute and the background music relaxing. There is single and two player mode. Would be great for long car trips. The words are a little hard for small children but great for adults. At $.99 as often as you'll play ultimate hangman you'll get way more than your money's worth. There's a dictionary feature too. Great app.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|good modern interpretation of an old legend. lots of splashy blood. nothing you don't see in a video game. however, the themes and language are really violent and hateful. that makes it fun for grown-ups, but nightmare inducing for younger folk.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This movie was so much better than I expected.  I did not see it at the theater because I honestly was not impressed by the previews.  The actual movie, when I did watch it, was entertaining and left both me and my husband wanting more.  I am really hoping they come out with a sequel for John Carter-it's definitely one I would go to the theater to see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is amazing!<br />This is the best game I ever played in my life!<br />It's so much fun and an adventure game I love this game!<br />I'm so glad my friend told me about this game!

B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This app is great except for the fact that you need to turn the kindle on in order to shut it off. It should wake up by itself but not unlock and fifty the snooze option
0307949486|5.0|Engaged me from the beginning. Great character development, interesting plot. There really is a reason that it's been so popular.
0061733199|4.0|Just like the ad says-- good detail on a lot of situations.  More color pictures of plants would be nice.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love being able to download books to my kindle, so easy and fast. This was a great read and I can't wait to see the movie!
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Too long and no characters to care about.  CGI heavy and noticeably so.  The tiger pulls a meal threw bars way too narrow for the animal to fit through in it's first appearance.  If you're willing to let that past the editing room, that says something about the show.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I can't get th app to work  my phone! Says wifi is not hooked up and it is, so confused!
B002YCVX5S|1.0|Has Tarantino done another movie anywhere near as good as Pulp Fiction since?  No.  The Kill Bill movies were like someone pretending to be Tarantino, and this movie continues the tradition.  It's a paper thin plot laden with movie cliche characters, and you are forced to read subtitles of a story that doesn't even warrant dialogue its so predictable.  Christophe Waltz was really great, but everyone else was engaged in bombastic acting. It's like a bad comic book with a big budget.  Incredibly violent periodically beyond the general tone of the film, as well.
B00C7LB20C|4.0|This was a good movie with fresh story. The picture was sharp showed beautiful part of Europe, but I had difficulty with the sound. The sound wasn't clear enough.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This book felt like a long goodbye to a group of friends that I have journeyed with over 2 decades.  It was bittersweet for me.  Not all were happy times, but where does one find perfection?<br /><br />This book really was everything I had hoped for in a final book and more.  The story is brutal at some points, and humorous at others.  The tone of the end of days and loss of hope is well and fully set in this book.  With so many plot lines from many previous books, A Memory of Light does well to weave them all together for an ending, not the end.  Those that live, carry on.<br /><br />I found the epilogue to be a bit unsettling, and didn't quite click with some of the emotions or lack of emotions some of the characters were showing.  Almost shallow.  And then I figured that after days and days of fighting for their life, after events foretold for hundreds of generations came to be, after so many around them died... well, they had to be drained and numb.  Time to get back to just living without the weight of the world depending on every action being successful.<br /><br />I will wrap up with the word Thom Merrill finally settled upon near the end of the book... exquisite.<br />This was an exquisite journey for me.<br /><br />Thank you Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson.<br /><br />PS: Bela lives!!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This is the best show and I can sit and watch back-to-back episodes for hours.  They are all so clever and it makes me see how important it is to be conscious of everything around me.  This show displays a high level of intelligence.  The cast is the absolute best.<br /><br />I never grow bored of watching.<br /><br />Judith N.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|I thought that the movie was awesome. Ben Affleck played his role very well. I would recommend everyone to see it.
0394818237|1.0|This was my absolute favorite book as a child. My son fell in love with the Scarry book about airports, so I thought he would enjoy the best Scarry book ever even more. When our copy arrived in the mail, I was horrified to learn that Amazon has described the book incorrectly, listing it as published in 1968. Please beware that this is an abridged version that is missing several of the most interesting stories (water purification, the stay at home mom). It has also been edited by the PC police, so some of Scarry's clever text is gone. What a shame that the ignorant publisher thought they should 'improve' a perfect work of children's literature.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I thought that the movie had some hilarious scenes, but then some of them were not and a bit over the top. everyone who likes comedy should watch this movie.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great addition to the Game of Thrones Series.  Adds data that was skimmed over in the previous book and keeps you turning pages.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I really need to know when the next book is due out!!! Please do not tell me I have to wait a year!!! This book was amazing, I could not put it down, and now that I have finished, and can't stop thinking about it!!! I would highly recommend this series!!!

B005C8ENI0|4.0|This was an enjoyable better than average movie.  I would like to give it 3 1/2.  Would recommend to friends.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Good sound quality good battery life, overall love it.  One quirk is the fact that it can work with multiple phones simultaneously caused and issue when both phones are in range and you are trying to speak between them, example following behind the vehicle with the other phone closely.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Love it - even though we all know the ending, the suspense was unbelievable. Great story, amazing acting...must see movie!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I had ti finish this series to find out what happens to the characters and the world. I liked the series
B009VB9VKY|3.0|Are the guys hot? YES...is there anything else worth watching this movie for? NO. If your in it for the hot guys (be honest with yourself) you've got a winner. If you are looking for a storyline...look elsewhere.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|A historical novel that expands many years and many families that finally intertwine together.  My kind of book.  Can't wait for the 3rd.
B000UDNBQW|5.0|This author took Great Expectations to a new level! He created for children, otherwise stuck with circumstances beyond their control,  a world of possibilities!
1250012570|5.0|This is one of those books that once it's in your hands everything else in your life will be neglected.  I so fell in love with these characters that they were all I cared about while reading this book. No I am not 16 either - I am 45. ha ha This book is beautifully done and I will be looking for Rainbow's next novel!!
B0051O8Z66|5.0|Its better than the version in the UK as the import you get more song (8)extra and i put it on my I Pod<br /><br />Cool
0375413405|5.0|After reading Julia Child's memoirs and biographies (including the story behind writing this cookbook), I absolutely fell in love with this book at first sight. It is beautifully written, very detailed with interesting facts and anecdotes, and a great read. The recipes are laborious but full of love. It's almost a spiritual connection to Julia Child herself - pouring over the same words she flitted through her typewriter and recreating the same recipes she created in her kitchen over steaming pots and butter splattered manuscript pages. Just a truly lovely book for pleasure reading, reference, or collecting.

B0042X9L6A|4.0|The flash is very user friendly, relatively inexpensive, and seems to function pretty well... but here are my problems; It really seems to overexpose my images when in TTL mode using my Nikon D-700. I often have to compensate for the flash output when taking portraits. I am an experienced photographer so I really don't think it's my fault, because I've tried various settings and modes, but there is always that possibility I suppose. Also, as I saw someone else note in these reviews, it really doesn't play very nice with my pocket wizards. It will occasionally just misfire... even when the equipment is far from hot - which is embarassing during a portrait shoot. I didn't give this product 3 stars because there are a lot of variables that could be at play here, but it's something to think about. I have the new SB-910 on the way so I will be able to compare their functionality and performance soon.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|This was a gift sent directly to them.  As I did not received any complaints, I rate it a 4 star.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|A great positive flow album, great straight through or shuffle, not one song feels out of place. If you like their sound, you'll like the whole album.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|just what we where looking for  fast service<br />  great price  if you want see more and  the parts ledft out of the series and  directors cuts<br />  its all there--- real good!
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Curiously enough, the trilogy The Lord of the Rings seemed to me like Tolkien's second attempt at The Hobbit; now The Hobbit is Peter Jackson's second attempt at The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />At first glance the thing that hit me immediately was the incredible attention to detail at every turn. I'm sure The Lord of the Rings had a similar attention to detail, but perhaps seeing The Hobbit on a better screen made me more aware. The filmmakers left nothing to chance like they did with The Lord of the Rings;  I had the distinct impression that they knew what they were doing this time. The script was thoughtful and the visual effects were honestly stunning; light years ahead of the somewhat cumbersome work in its predecessors. I'll probably never tire of watching the wind ripple through the CGI feathers of the eagles in the final scenes.<br /><br />The casting is excellent. Through the movie's nearly three hour run time I didn't notice a spot of bad acting. I'll never forgive Viggo Mortensen's horrific acting, or Liv Tyler's; Even Elijah Wood with his iridescent eyes was bland. In contrast, Martin Freeman as Bilbo was a streak of genus and I don't wonder at Jackson's persistence in getting him to accept the part. The thirteen dwarfs are in a category of their own. Peter Jackson put off making the Hobbit for so long because of the dwarfs; it was going to be a little like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, only worse. I was frankly lost in the novel what with Filis and Kilis, Gloins and Oins running about in an unordered mass.  Fortunately, the wait paid off; each of the dwarfs has a distinct personality and appearance, breaking into little pieces the rule that all dwarfs must be fat, dumpy and ugly. The fan girls must be pleased.<br /><br />When I first read The Hobbit back when I was twelve, I was disappointed. The plot seemed a little pointless; it appeared that it was just a pack of greedy dwarfs off to take back a treasure that wasn't entirely theirs (killing the dragon wasn't even in the mix). In the film (actually, I shouldn't call it that) a new meaning has been infused, there's more at stake than the gold, and adding the subplots from the appendices (which I have not read) is extremely intriguing.<br /><br />Of course with all its strong points, there are weak points as well. Like The Lord of the Rings the thing moves slowly in places and the battle scenes are often excessive and less than believable. I don't mind a few dead enemies, but our heroes plow through hundreds of them in a death defying manner and come out without a scratch at the other end (their swords are still shiny, too). I understand they have to leave the blood out in order to keep it PG-13, but wouldn't a few high quality sword fights like what we saw in Kingdom of Heaven (I didn't like that movie, by the way) or even Pirates of the Caribbean have been better?<br /><br />I watched the movie a second time (which is unusual for me), doing my own editing and ended up enjoying it even more than the first time around. There are a few scenes from The Lord of the Rings that I'll always remember; the Charge of Rohirrim, with the very earth shaking under my feet and the frankly heart rending death of Boromir, but now, I'll also be remembering the hauntingly beautiful Over the Misty Mountains Cold sung in the rumbling voices of the actors themselves.<br /><br />To put it in a nutshell, I enjoyed it and I'm awaiting the next installment eagerly.

0316187216|2.0|This is the way you bring back the Bloody-Nine?<br /><br />Question -who is the best character in the Abercrombie universe?  Easy.  The Bloody-Nine.  Does anyone disagree with that?  Well, I suppose Glotka was ok too, but let's face it... The Bloody-Nine is the best.<br /><br />So what the heck is up with this book?  The Bloody-Nine is back as a guy named Lamb, but the reader is always stuck in the position of detachment from what he is doing.  There is no connection with the B9, just observation from afar...  like being a B9 voyeur or something.<br /><br />In other words, the connection between the reader and the best character in the series is at a distance.  We experience the B9, but always through the eyes of other characters.<br /><br />Imagine if you watched Star Wars, but only saw what Luke Skywalker was doing for a more distant perspective.  How would that work?  It wouldn't.  It would suck.<br /><br />If you can endure the first boring half of the book, the second half of the book was better.  On the other hand, I must confess that the \\"who is he\\" games with the B9 got a bit old.  The whole book is like one drawn out hint at who Lamb really is.  Every time is seems Lamb might open up, something pops up out of nowhere to end the conversation.  The words \\"Bloody-Nine\\" are not in the book at all.  What is the point of setting up a big reveal if there is never a big reveal?  It's like all foreplay then getting up and walking out the door.  Hey!  Come back here!  We spent the whole night teasing and there is no big reveal?<br /><br />I also thought that the whole western feel was just a bit weird.  Yeah, weird.  The rest of Abercrombie's books aren't \\"western\\" in any way, so why this one?  It just didn't fit.  Imagine if Tolkien had written The Return of the King in a western style and the dwarfs and elves started saying \\"I reckon...\\" all the time.  How would that be?  Well... I reckon it would suck.<br /><br />On a side note, the B9 reminds me of Bo Jackson. Ispent a night locked in my garage (wearing an aluminum foil thong) thinking about it and that's what I came up with.  Can anyone else do what the B9 does?  No.  Could anyone else do what Bo did?  No.  When was the last time someone ran up and across an outfield wall?<br /><br />But then once you accept that the B9 is Bo Jackson, what does that make the Boz?  Is the Boz Glam Golden?  You know what, I think he is.<br /><br />Wait a minute!  If that is the case, then Red Country is really based on the 1987 Monday Night Football game between the Seahawks and the Raiders!  Those are both west coast teams, so maybe that explains the western style of the book.

B007AJFSJW|5.0|I have little doubt that many reading this book will quickly barricade their mind against the ideas that are being discussed - it's hard not to. With the hyper-aggressive media the way that it is now, opinion (presented as fact) is forced into the mind of so many with very little getting in the way of challenging it from a perspective of truth. With this in mind we need to remain open to ideas that may not suit our pre-conceived notions of right and wrong - because otherwise how can we learn anything?<br /><br />This may sound like the start of a review suggesting that you adopt into your mind all that is being presented in this book as complete truth and the only realistic course of action. Far from it. But being open to learning something new is so much more important than sitting down with the mindset that you will prove to yourself why Krugman's philosophy is wrong.<br /><br />The author says repeatedly that economics is not a science that can be driven by statistical analysis alone. Opinion will be driven by political leanings too. For all of us though be sure to look for what makes sense. Certainly, many of the pro-austerity arguments make sense - at least at face value. Just as many Keynesian views will make sense - at face value. Be sure to analyse both sides of the argument because it's not one that should merely be a reflection of your political allegiences. So don't be sold on the politicians one-liners on the news. Be open minded and allow yourself to form your own opinion. Finish this book and read something from the Austrian economics side of the argument - there is lots out there.<br /><br />Why 5 stars - this book above so many others makes some big statements. The difference? It presents in a way that is informative, interesting and is backed by data. You can argue the interpretation of course. This book I believe challenges the one-liner that passes these days as political discussion and helps the reader to build their own path. So leave your preconceptions at the door and see if you can grow your own opinions because if we don't create our own reality - we will be left to live in that conjured by others.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wish I hadn't waited so long to get around to reading these books! Glad I didn't completely let them pass me by! Can't wait to start Book II!
B00BWU0S3Q|4.0|Lots of action, movie moved really quickly. Was expecting another &#34;Untouchables&#34;, but got something a little different. Great actors, but script seemed to lack a little. Loved the idea of &#34;Bad vs Good&#34;, and &#34;Good&#34; wins.

B00785P2QC|5.0|Very addictive game but costs too much money if you want to actually get any where. Too expensive to buy the money needed
B005S9EKCW|4.0|This was described as all regions but the DVD was for region 1, not suitable for Australia unless I have a region free DVD player. No problems with Blu-ray Disc. I don't know yet whether digital copy is accessible to me in Australia.
B000FBJFSC|2.0|This edition of the book had different fonts, some repeated material and did not sync between my Kindle and Kindle for PC readings.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|They call it &#34;Masterpiece Theater&#34; for a reason. So perfectly written. Hateable and lovable characters, very true to history. So sad to watch what things were naturally accepted and what things were not. Beautifully acted.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I loved everything about this movie.  The love for her sister,  The action was fantastic.  The acting was the best. I think everyone would enjoy this movie.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Product received was a fake. If it is priced too reasonably then it's probably too good to be true.<br /><br />Very appreciative to Amazon for refunding me my money after the product fell apart within 5 months of purchasing.<br /><br />Buyer beware!

B003U53GK8|1.0|People who knew & watched the series warned me not to even start watching but I didn't listen to them. I could write a book on my aggravation & why, but that will take too much time and this series doesn't deserve any more of my time. Reviewing this is more than they deserve, but in warning.......<br /><br />If you haven't seen the entire series of LOST as I did & spent days into weeks streaming & watching each episode from Amazon, my suggestion is DON'T GET STARTED!  The first four seasons are great--well acted, well designed, etc. constantly holding interest with each cliffhanger episode & season, but when it comes to wrapping their ever spinning more questions than answers story up, they fail quite miserably with the proverbial phallic finger directed so evidently to the entire world for ever investing time & interest in their lame & evidently as LOST as they are series.<br /><br />If you stay with the series up to 4 & even through Season 5 you will be a lot happier than EVER watching Season 6. STOP WITH SEASON 5 is a sincere warning! The end of Season 5, yes, leaves you with a lot of questions and wondering of end-stories and unexplained character plots & history, etc. but nothing like the fiasco of Season 6 and how they chose to end the series. If you have any common sense in your brain whatsoever, it will really mess with a huge bunch of \\"well if you're going to conclude it this way, then what you did before doesn't make ANY sense whatsoever. Also, literary license doesn't even fit or even science-fiction with the miss-mash of storylines & final conclusion(s) to this season. There are so many better angles and conclusions they could have taken with the story that were much more reasonable & believable and would have followed the previous episodes & seasons characters & plots, but apparently the producers & writers either didn't care to do so, don't have the talent or mindset to do so, or both!<br /><br />If you do watch, perhaps just to see how vile & evil ABC and JJ Abrams & his many companion writers/producers, et al, really are, and get interested & invested in it all, like my friends & family have all said to me, \\"I TOLD YOU NOT TO WATCH IT!\\"and JJ Abrams & his many companion writers/producers, et al, really are, and get interested & invested in it all, like my friends & family have all said to me, \\"I TOLD YOU NOT TO WATCH IT!\\"
B005I4JG80|5.0|Living exactly the opposite if the author, a french mom in New York, I'm stunned by how close her observations are to my own. Except she says it with a great pen and fabulous humor. A must read for all moms trying to find a balance.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this movie , scenery in North Carolina, great acting, great special effects, storyline was believable!!  Sequel maybe forthcoming?
0812993845|4.0|I love Sophie Kinsella! She's a great writer and I was very excited to read her latest! I was not disappointed at all! Not only is the story engaging, but it keeps you interested and turning the pages. Lottie is a great character but sometimes I cringed when I read a certain part. She's a little silly and had me thinking why on earth would she say/do that? But, alas, it is a book and is just for entertainment purposes, so I can let that slide. It also isn't one of the BEST Kinsella novels, but it's not so horrible that I wouldn't spend money on it. I would recommend it if you're a die hard Kinsella fan.
B000YDAYHC|5.0|I really like these stylish boots and they are comfortable at that! These boots feel very well made and have a lot of craftsmanship with some durable stitching. They are the most comfortable boots that I have put on in a while now and well worth the money to me. You know sometimes you have to pay for quality and you can feel and see it in these boots! The fact now that I have worn these boots to work numerous times because they are more comfortable than my new balance tennis shoes ought to tell you something!!!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is, by far, the best game you can buy for a dollar. I own Scribblenauts for the PC (purchased through Steam), which costs significantly more. Despite being an adult, this game is great fun, and definitely keeps you thinking. Overall, a LOT of fun!
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|I have been a Trekkie most of my life.  I remember watching STOS on prime-time TV.  Watching these remastered episodes in HD on my 60&#34; TV was like a dream come true.  The editors did a great job cleaning /enhancing the episodes while staying true to the original look and feel.  I have hesitated buying the other two seasons because I already spend too much time watching these DVDs!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Great game to pass the time. keeps your mind active. Has a lot of levels to play and all skill levels.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I absolutely love every song on this album, and that never happens!  I hadn't heard of this band before &#34;Madness&#34; came out, but I am now going back to listen because I loved this one so much!
B004LRVFX4|5.0|I LOVE this movie. It was well worth the price. Who doesn't love the old classic monsters? Yup, love em!
1419701533|5.0|My 8 year old grandson loves to read and had been getting these books from the library.  He was thrilled that I had ordered the set from Amazon.  He loves reading and this is a great set.
B003XYE7R2|5.0|The Hound of the Baskervilles is such an amazing book. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is descriptive, (With a LARGE vocabulary) interesting, and surprising! He puts a twist on the story, keeping each chapter mysterious. I REALLY enjoyed it.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have an eeepad transformer. I have to be connected to wifi to open the app, which is impossible at work, dr offices, etc. I can only see a few books on my carousel, which happened to be the last books I deleted off my device. Although I have over 300 books on my device, the app closes every time I click on the option to load the books on my device. As an avid reader, I am crushed. I want my books back!
B00BC0JGCA|5.0|Okay when I first listened to the album trailer I wasn't that impressed but as a fan I had to get this album and I figured that it would grow on me in time. Once I popped the cd in I was automatically impressed with what I heard from start to finish. There awesome blend of dark metal with their mixture of fun folk melodies are all there in full force without a dull minute in between. My only complaint is that there isn't their usual acoustic and or instrumental track but I don't hold it against the album. The artwork as usual is amazing and the best way to describe it is that it's post apocalyptic, steam punk and trollish if that helps.<br />  If you like the direction that Finntroll has taken with their past few albums or just a fan of folk metal then you have to get this album you will not be disappointed but glad that you did.
B008GGA5EQ|5.0|Chloe Thurlow has already set high standards in erotic fiction and \\"Girl Trade\\" takes those standards even higher.  Other reviewers have described the plot; what sets this work apart from almost all others in the genre is the sheer breadth, depth and quality of the writing.  The author takes us on a journey that is primarily erotic, but also cultural and even philosophical.  It is particularly notable that the author allows her protagonist to find solace in a culture which has such strong contrasts with her own.<br /><br />This is a book that you can skip through for the erotic sections of text or, as I did, savour the kaleidoscopic descriptions of the peoples and cultures that are so closely intertwined with the erotic.  Many times I found the descriptions of sight, sound and smell so detailed that I felt I was actually there in the heat and dust, watching the story unfold.  I found myself re-reading many sentences to extract the maximum information from the meticulously chosen words.  I was rewarded with an intensity of experience such as I have never had before, at least while reading a book.<br /><br />I believe that \\"Girl Trade\\" possibly raises modern erotic fiction to an altogether new level, and that Chloe Thurlow sets standards to which some writers in the genre can only aspire.  I rated it at 5 stars which was surely insufficient to display how far this book stands out above others in the genre.  Without hesitation, I recommend this book to both men and women who enjoy fine erotic fiction and are over 18.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this series and she is not a science fiction fan. We became fans of Nathan Fillion and now follow him on Castle.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I liked this second book in the series. The story was intriguing and fast moving; the characters were real and believable. The story line was carried over to this book and well developed. I'm anxious to read book #3!
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This book is great for personal development. I recommend it to anyone for any walk of life. The message in this book is solid!
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|It came early which was good because it was a birthday present. And it was a great gift, my son loved all that came with it.
B008J5T4Q4|5.0|My girlfriend  has recently decided she wants to collect vinyl records and I am in love with P!nk... this item was a perfect gift for her and the bonus was that it came with a CD that she plays in her car all the time!
B000AP04MO|5.0|I saw this when it came out years ago and loved it just as much when watching it again, the only draw back is that it skips near the end.

B005HSL626|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I loaded this, but this game is a riot...it is a simple concept but it is fun!  I started playing and lost all track of time with this one!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I read the Percy Jackson series and loved it.  I read it because I have two young boys and wanted to know what good books there were for that age group.  It was so good that I ended up reading all the books!  I was sad the series ended, but was really happy when I found out Rick Riordan had written another series that starts right were the Percy Jackson series left off.  This is good for all ages.
B00BD2DRHW|2.0|Good thing it was a free app; I would have kicked myself if I would have bought it.  I can fix any PC but I could get this app at all. Loaded it one day and unloaded it the next.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|Not sure how Connelly keeps delivering good plots for Harry, but he does and this was as enjoyable as any.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|This app would be good for anyone who enjoys all Religion all the time.  I was very disappointed- I was looking for a TV app to keep me entertained with shows I know.  Free app but still not worth the download time.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Love this style of  hidden object game. Concern with having to buy dimonds, don't want to end up spending more buying dimonds than what it would cost to buy a equally interesting game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app, if you like Solitaire.  I play this all the time..it's a great stress reliever.  Clear graphics and no sluggishness- I would highly recommend this app to any card player!
B001F12J48|1.0|This is not for 3d TV's came with four glasses you know the cheep paper one. Blue in one lens red in the other. Tried to look at it but glasses did not fit. Probably made for kids I would not let my kids waste there eyes trying to look at this. If I could this would have no star but need it to write this review. It did come with regular dvd which was good.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Interesting, suspenseful, difficult to put down, thrilling, intriguing, captivating,and enjoyable. Would be interested in reading future books by William Landay
0307352153|4.0|This was the first book I've found or read on Introverts.  The author makes it acceptable and admirable to choose the quiet side of life.  Her descriptions of Harvard's social emphasis were both amusing and educational as they promote the outgoing personality.  It was a comfort to read the summary of positive traits of the introvert and to be encouraged to accept them for who they are.  The book is well researched and supported in its analysis.  This is helpful to those who know they are introverts and to those who live or work with one.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I LIKED THE SUSPENSE OF THE STORY. FAST PACED AND EXCITING. LOVE HER. I AM HOOKED ON HER CONCERN FOR THE FALLEN.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|All the good ones here. I have been looking for this CD for a long time, The band from Tenn. rocks
B0009VSB06|5.0|My 10 year old stepson wanted a metal detector for his birthday.  He is a pretty well-behaved and responsible young man and I've always leaned towards avoiding \\"toy\\" tools.  In my opinion rather than encouraging learning they tend to just cause more frustration.  (Anyone ever use a kiddie fishing pole for more than a month??)  So I decided that I was going to get him a \\"real\\" metal detector.  This is also well outside my own knowledge, I've never owned or used one before.  My impressions were good right out of the box.  I watched the included dvd and found pretty quickly that it's not really that complicated a device* (I'll come back to that, please don't burn me yet!!)  Fairly quickly I had a fair grasp of how it works and it wasn't really difficult to explain it to my stepson.  My first idea was to take him up into the woods behind my house (roughly a half mile mostly up hill) where I knew there to be an old house foundation from a very long time ago.  (There aren't even roads there anymore and haven't been in my lifetime.)  I ended up carrying it and the weight really isn't that bad.  I remembered not long after arriving at the top of the hill that I had forgotten to bring extra batteries.  Didn't end up being an issue, we were there probably an hour and a half and the batteries held up just fine.  Our haul ended up being several rusted nails, a massively rusted axe head and an old door hinge.  We had fun though so it's all good.  It read iron mostly on the nails though it did occasionally misread on the larger items.  The axe head and the hinge both read coins I believe.  I really didn't expect it to be 100% dead on accurate though so I wasn't disappointed.  Going back to me not seeing it as that complicated a device... I am sure that metal detectors in general have a learning curve much like any device of that type and that right now I am very low on that curve.  An experienced hunter could probably point out tons of mistakes I made just from this review, but what I meant was that it really didn't take us long at all to be up and running and having fun while learning.  That to me is worth the price.  If you buy this detector I hope you are as happy with it as my stepson and I and thanks for taking the time to read my review.hat I meant was that it really didn't take us long at all to be up and running and having fun while learning.

B0042FZOFU|5.0|On time and exactly what I expected to receive, brand new movies and secure packaging. I expect to watch these movies 100' s of times with my kids!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book!! Couldn't put it down!! I can not wait to read the next one! I am totally hooked!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really loved the way this book was written. Makes you think differently if you're having a bad ..... It won't seem so bad.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Riveting movie.  It is a must see.  A young lady in intelligence in a tenacious pursuit to locate Osama Bin Ladin.  True story.  We thought it was one of those movies that you don't want to stop even for a potty break because it was that good and couldn't wait to see what happened next!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|its just what i wanted i looked it up and its suposed to be one of the best termal paste out there and u can use it for like 5 to 6 CPU's
B00991TCOG|3.0|It was just barely &#34;OK&#34;. If the rest of her albums sound like this one...then, I won't buy them. Her music started of sort of cool...with a nice &#34;rock&#34; beat to it (considering she's playing a violin). But...after about the 3rd or 4th song... they all started sounded the same. Plus...her background beat sounded the same almost all the time (sort of like one of those electronic music-machines that guitarists, etc. use in cheap bars, lounges, etc.). Same beat...over and over and over.<br />Too bad. ELO (Electric Light Orchestra) did an excellent job of using symphony-style instruments...and... not having each song sound the same. I hope Lindsey figures out a way to use her talent (which she clearly has a LOT of) and her violin... more successfully in the future...with music that is not always so redundant.
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|I heard this about 3 or 4 days prior. It sounds really good. New daft punk about time. Hopefully they drop more hits like this in the near future.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really like the new additions to this game! My only complaint is that it keeps crashing. It may possibly need an update? I don't know but I had a lot of fun when I was able to play it :)
B000031EGV|5.0|OH MY GOD IT'S SO FAST SHIPPING............IT CAME BEFORE THE DELIVERY DATE..........THE MOVIE WAS COOL........THE DVD IN EXCELLENT SHAPE.......THE PICTURE QUALITY AND THE SOUND QUALITY WAS EXECELLENT............I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT........THANKS TO AMAZON SERVICE.......
B00AMBH70S|1.0|What a waste of money! A lame attempt to ride on the coattails of the Bourne Trilogy, this has absolutely nothing going for it. Lackluster acting, no chemistry between the leads, an incoherent plot...stay away!!
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|This album is literally my favorite one of the year. I can't stop listening. All the tracks on here are great. I love the energy that's in these songs! Will not disappoint. Not sure how this band hasn't become more popular yet..... I'm know I'm spreading them around as much as I can. Seriously though, quit asking if this is worth it. I assure you, it is.
B0063M22QO|1.0|This mahjong game is very slow and I made it through level 1 in an hour and if I wanted to move on to the next level I had to pay again. It was not worth the money I paid.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Sooooo much funnier with a better plot line than I expected.  I watched it several times during my rental period!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I had an older Belkin Nostromo Speedpad n50 a long time ago and wanted something similar to that for some of the games I play. I like how all the keys are programmable as well you can set up a couple different profiles for the games you play. Plus the little screen can give you your CPU/RAM stats while playing. It does have a really good feel to it once you get use to the key layout since it is not a full size keyboard, feel a bit lost without my home row keys. One annoying thing is the little joystick does not register a direction sometimes but not sure if that is me just not hitting it in the right direction or if I need to adjust the sensitivity level.<br /><br />One thing to note is on Logitech's website it states a 3 years warranty and Amazon shows only 1 year.
B004PVKFR8|2.0|The track from Vikings is the only song I really like on the whole album.  I am not sure why, but this album has such a range of styles.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I feel this  book, as the ending of the trilogy, was quite meaningful.<br />Although the books were  written for the young adult market, it was enjoyed by my older female book club members..<br />The main characters were well developed. Family values showed thru, The lack of the meaning of life , displayed by the  &#34;capitol&#34; people was outstandingly portrayed.Government is what it is!<br />HOw violence is promoted was a lesson to young.<br />I would hope that the younger reading this would have good discussions, which can further the understanding of &#34;society&#34;.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|Started out a little slow, but after a while became very interesting. True insite of how family effects your decisions in life.
0062082353|5.0|I found this book a very easy read and, being interested in military and biographical books, found it quite compelling. I highly recommend it!
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I just downloaded it yesterday morning, I have not had time to learn how to use it.  How would anyone know what they think about it in less than 24 hours?  Asking for a review too soon is not going to get a good review from me.
B001QL5MAA|5.0|Has it all - good science, good fiction, real character development. A great find for any science fiction fan.  Read it!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Arguably the best movie to come out in the last 8 years. Above and beyond every American movie to win &#34;Best Picture&#34; in that time frame.<br />Limiting myself to praising one aspect, I would highlight the incredible character development. Every character in the movie is rich and complex, and unpredictable. You grow attached to them, think you understand them, and then that character catches you completely off guard.<br />Watch it. You will be drawn in immediately, and when it ends, you will suddenly remember that you were watching a movie, not living the life of others.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Beautiful footage of northeastern Pennsylvania.  I'm from there and fear for what is happening to the environment in such a lovely area.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love this movie and Jennifer Lawrence, such an innocent hero. Can't wait to see the next version of this movie.
B0011E9LBI|5.0|This was a hilarious movie that stands the test of time well. Seeing Will Smith in one of his earliest roles was refreshing and supporting cast Rip Torn, Tommy Lee Jones and Tony Shalhoub round out the great cast.
B000Q31L4U|1.0|This film had about all the elements you'd expect to see in a modern day movie: Suspense, drama, action, great story line...It also had the added bonus of not being overly predictable. Some of the characters may have been a bit overdramatic, but it is more targeted to kids so that's expected. The animation artistic qualities are great.<br />So why the low rating?<br />It's a Christmas movie...with no mention of Christ. He is the reason to celebrate Christmas & without Him there is no Christmas. This is like so many movies that attempt to portray deep emotion and compassion without giving tribute to the Creator of all life. Dissappointed....
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|... some heavy overtones from the Tron:Legacy soundtrack (which isn't surprising; it's the same director)<br /><br />Overall, excellent to chill out to... up there with Moon and Drive
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|Bring Me The Horizons new album blows all the others out of the water. The song 'Sleepwalking' is a melodious mix of holyshithisissofrickingamzing and over all greatness. On this album Oli's Sykes voice is unmatched as per usual, and Matt Nichols drumming never fails to impress. Buy it even if you need to sell a kidney for it. Totally worth it.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|Watching the shows all over again makes my wife happy...\\"Happy wife....Happy Life!\\"  She loves the drama, the comedy especially when is comercial free!
B00004VW5A|5.0|This came with all the CDs and booklets. The box was perfect honestly it was brand new. Love it great collector piece.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Got this as a \\"free app of the day\\" from Amazon.<br /><br />It's a fun game.  Animations are cute as you progress through each round and incorrectly guess letters.  The only problem I've found is that the words stored in the application are limited; you'll see the same words repeatedly - almost consecutively!<br /><br />The lexicon needs to be expanded!
B006LSZECO|5.0|TERRIFIC!  I would read it again in a heartbeat and recommend it to friends.  Very enjoyable.  Suspenseful, heartbreaking, a page turner.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Great new objects and levels. More than that, it's worth the dollar to see Om Nom in French Renaissance clothing.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Excellent time piece, easy to look at.  REGARDLESS OF IT's waterproof rating, it handles the shower well.  Fits this small -medium boned woman perfectly.
B00A77II0U|4.0|If you like Snark Busters type games and don't mind a bit of a dark storyline get this game. Graphics are great on my Toshiba Thrive 10&#34; screen. Ability to enlarge the picture for the hidden objects parts is great! Large file so be sure that you use a wi-fi connection for loading. Overall great game that I would recommend to others.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just downloaded this app and so far it works perfectly, It's completely user friendly. I love that it is bright and has a simple design.
B005EWDAFQ|4.0|I'm definitely a Robert Harris fan but I did wonder if I would be disappointed by this book due to the reviews on here.  But I downloaded it anyway as I had some spare time on my hands.  Well I'm glad I did as yet again, Harris has given us a well crafted, page turning thriller.<br /><br />This novel is set in the financial world but don't let that put you off if, like me, you find stocks and shares confusing and impenetrable.  The main character, Alex, is a genius in the finance world and we follow him as he has one hell of a day.  He is a member of the super-rich but this book gives us an insight into his world of wealth.  He is under threat and the tension slowly builds up until you are rattling through the pages to find out what happens.<br /><br />I liked this book, it's a taut thriller that keeps you engaged and I learnt a bit about the finance world as well.  I like Harris's uncluttered prose - he doesn't dwell on pretensions but his thrillers are intelligent enough to make you think.  Worth a download, it's a good thriller.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|my new favorite book.  I recommend to all ages, but it's mostly aimed at younger readers.  I couldn't put it down!
030758836X|5.0|Interesting and not what your expecting. Not your typical thriller. You should definitely give it a shot you won't be disappointed.
0345525558|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read!  I would put it on my top ten list.  The story is capitaving - sad, happy, frustrating, and kept me wondering what was going to happen next.  I hate books that I can figure out the story by the time I get through the first chapter - this one wasn't that way.  I think this would be a good book club discussion book - especially if the members have any experience with foster care children.
B007JMW46U|4.0|I always wanted to read these but never took the time. I downloaded it for free and immensely enjoyed the short mysteries.
0312600844|2.0|I really wanted to find this book totally enthralling; however, my interest began to ebb when I couldn't find a reason to care about the characters and their totally self-absorbed lives.  I think Franzen writes very well, and I hoped that Freedom would be a better vehicle for his talent than The Corrections.  Apparently he is simply not the author for me.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it. It's easy to use and entertaining.<br />To bad there isn't more things to do on this app
B003DNN0L2|3.0|but not my favorite by Mr. Andersen.  I love Moonrise Kingdom much more.  Great voices by famous actors and actresses.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this game. She plays it all the time. The only complaint I have is that it is time consuming.
1400049628|5.0|this book is amazing you dont even have to apply all the zombie rules to JUST zombies. i learned somethings in this book that i could use in any natural disaster or if something bad were to happen. the book is very interesting and extremely educating!!!
0547884591|5.0|Really impressed with the knowledge offered in this book. Have never seen a book like this that covers so many topics. Tim Ferriss, is a very good author, and am very pleased to recommend any of his books for reading and applying to your individual lives. Clear and concise instruction, .Plenty of examples and incidents.
B004L03B3S|4.0|As one would expect from a Brazilian film it was beautifully framed with Latin rhythms at appropriate times.  The actors were attractive and portrayed the characters in a very realistic fashion.  The fact that they were brothers, may have added an exotic, forbidden element but it probably happens more often than many realize and was portrayed as entirely natural.
B0084670FU|2.0|Too many different story lines that didn't tie together very well. See Crash it does this concept a whole lot better. I really like the films that Brad Pitt is in, but this one was not up to par for him at all.
0762445262|5.0|It is small, don't expect a big bat signal or for it to go across the room but it is a great little piece to own (and I do mean little.) My boys love to use it with their action figures and my daughter likes to use it with her dolls.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The horror of the child abuse was heart wrenching.  I really had to skim those chapters to avoid being sick with despair at what evil people are capable of.<br />However, the fight for life and the kindness of good people kept me reading and hoping for a true chance of happiness for Jamie and Lydia.<br />I could feel the truth of what was presented.
0307454568|5.0|I have bought and read all of Stieg Larsson's trilogy books with great gripping interest in the characters and plots.  I had a hard time putting the books down when getting into the reading.  Although, 5 pages were missing.  485-489.
030746363X|5.0|The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman.<br /> An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, is just that. Was 309 lbs on April 11, 2013 and weighed 288 lbs this AM, April 25, 2013, using this eating program. Never hungry, allowed to eat all I want of the prescribed foods, 6 days a week, on the seventh day, you can eat anything that you feel you are not allowed to eat the rest of the week. In a nut shell, &#34;IT WORKS&#34;. Have tried other eating programs, and failed miserable, by gaining back more weight than I had lost.  An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, seems to work because I have embarrassed it, and am very comfortable in using it. Will recommend this to anyone who has been overweighjt for a long time and is ready for a change in your life. Read this book form page 70 to 99, for &#34;The Slo-Carb Diet&#34;, not a long read but will get you started. Then take time and read the book from cover to cover, just for your information. Learned a lot of things I had never read or heard before..
B001DHXT6G|5.0|the service was excellent. I purchased the inhanced series. It is better then I imagined. The application to time period is still appropriate
B001MTENOC|5.0|I have never read a book on this subject before and thought it very interesting.  It makes me stop and consider how many lives have I lived and is this the one &#34;I am dying to live&#34;?
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Great family movie to watch with the kids, all three of mine (age 4-10) loved it, even my husband was excited to watch it again after taking my eldest to see it in the theater.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|this book is not as good as the first but it doesnt disappoint it does get a little weird but other than that its good
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Jacob - did he do it?  Well written legal thriller. It moves a little slowly but the timing is perfect.  Being accused of murdering a classmate - the family must deal with the process, the people both prosecuting and neighbors accusing. We like all of the characters, but whose the bad guy?  Prosecutor?  Typical teenage boy?
B00AL6SM0S|4.0|I won't write a lengthy review of the contents, because the performances are so obviously self-recommending, and I haven't listened to the entire set.  I know most of these broadcasts from previous issues, and all are worth hearing repeatedly.<br /><br />I've compared the 1937 Siegfried to the previous Naxos issue [[ASIN:B000067UM3 Wagner: Siegfried (Broadcast on January 30, 1937)]], and the new version sounds SUBSTANTIALLY better - both much quieter and with a more natural sound to the voices.<br /><br />But who on earth approved the packaging?  The concept is fine, but the execution absurd.  The sleeves are so tight that it's virtually impossible to remove the discs without damaging the sleeves.  Don't even think about trying the usual method of squeezing the sleeve to release the disc; the disc won't budge and the sleeve will tear.  I know, because I tried it.... Had the sleeves been made 1 mm wider, there'd be no problem.  I suspect that the folks at BMG expect people to buy this set and put it on the shelf, where it will look lovely, and not actually play the discs.
B006RJTEIC|2.0|Hated it and turned it off.  I am a senior so younger folks may like, but I do not think so.
B009NXAMW6|5.0|Both leading rolls well acted. I never thought that it would end the way it did, well written. Makes you wonder how many criminals actually are insane,
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  America is wishy washy in this book so I kept thinking how is this only the 2nd book!  I kept trying to figure out what was going to happen at the end and was blown away by what happens.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its fast paced and fun, hard but not overtly difficult. Challenging. Graphics are nice. It is repetitive so I can't speak on how long I'll continue to be interested in it. But beyond any doubt I think every smartphone owner should at least try this game (the price for this great a game can't be beat!)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Absolutely unlimited bingo fun!<br />I have uses this app for several months, I have never had any issues with the game not functioning properly. Would highly recommend it:!
B003YBUSMW|3.0|It is ok for fun and definitely better than just using the remote. But doesn´t really feel like you´re in the race, as with other wheels with feedback and a third pedal for clutch.
B00AW57L96|4.0|The easy style of writing makes a great read. The ending was disappointing, too &#34;happy ever afterish&#34; for me. Every storyline did not haveto have a happy ending
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote. I have it installed on my work PC, home laptop, Kindle Fire and my aneroid phone. any note, idea, photo, or website is available anywhere!
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Hard hitting but the end was a little weird.  Why they had Tom cruise play teacher still don't understand.  Theyneededsomeone like Hauer.
B004HXIZVC|3.0|This is an interesting app.  I haven't spent much time on it, but seems to be interesting to find new things to listen to.
B004SF2KNI|5.0|Although Clapton has tons of great work, Layla remains at the top of my music list of favorites. It's good stuff !!!!
B00BESIKWM|1.0|A slight improvement on the first film but they still don't seem to get it right.  I really wanted to enjoy this film.
B00008EY9G|5.0|This is the movie that your logic can predict outcome very safely. Acting is great, all the element of a good movie is there. I could not find any holes in the story and logically everything matches up. It is very hard to find a movie like this. If you enjoy thriller then you will enjoy this movie. There are much violence but it also is part of the story and not excessive for the commercialism's sake. I liked it.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|saw this game and thought i would try it and found it to be fast past and loads of fun
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I've always been a Star Trek fan since it first aired on television.  I had differing opinions of the six movies that were made with the original cast.  Some of the movies were good while others, I thought were mediocre.  I was skeptical that a movie made with new actors would match the original ensemble but was amazed with how well the new actors were able to bring their own flavor to the world of Star Trek.  It was eerie at times seeing actors who not only looked like, but were faithful in their portrayal of the original characters.  Whether you are an old fan of the TV series or an entirely new fan, I would recommend this movie to you.
B00008G7UF|3.0|The first five minutes is so full of skips and jumps that it's impossible to pick out what's going on in the film.  Somewhere in the middle it did the same thing.<br /><br />It's a wonderful movie, though!
B00881PTRC|3.0|The concept of this game is good.  I as an adult enjoyed playing, yet it would be great for my kids too.  The graphics and animations are great.  Unfortunately the game decided to force close while I was playing on my Kindle Fire. I also had a few repeated words.
0895260131|5.0|This book corrects a lot of misconceptions about early Islam and the Crusades.  I have heard so many say that early Islam was very generous to Christians and Jews and the Crusades ruined everything - I knew this was wrong, but this book gives so many answers that you can use in discussions to refute the myth of the early tolerance of Islam.
B00985E3UG|5.0|If you ever thought you gained weight because of a lack of will power, you should read this book.<br /><br />The obesity epidemic in this country and in Mexico is planned and perpetuated by masters of deception.  The food industry in America is exposed and laid bare for all to see and understand.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Nabarlek? Lagomorph? Seriously, you can't play with words youve never heard of. That's no fun. None of the dictionaries, except for Wikipedia, could define the words! Also it crashed after the first word I played.
B000I0QL82|5.0|It's not Christmas at our house without watching Holiday Inn.  We watch it as a family every year.  This year I gave each of the kids thier own copies so they can start the tradition with their significant other:-)
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found the book an easy read, informative, and detailed live of how a seal trains and sacrifice to insure America is save.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Serenity is the movie based off the fan favorite TV Show FireFly. It's blend of SciFi action, oddball humor, and quirky yet warm characters makes it a great show and film for any SciFi\Fantasy fan. I would recommend watching the full TV show series before watching Serenity.<br /><br />The movie was made to tie up the plot of the now cancelled show as best as possible, and without having watched the show, the movie will not be as easy to follow.<br /><br />In regards to the distributor, I purchased this BluRay used, and it came well packaged and in mint condition. I couldn't ask for a better Disk, new or used.
0812983459|5.0|Harold Fry, age 65, embarks on a pilgrimage during which he reflects on the nature of human life, his own history, and his failures.  If the reader is at all introspective and is approaching Harold's age, as I am, this is a deeply moving story.  Nearing old age, most of us take our own internal journey of reflection, regret, and atonement.  This novel spoke to me on a very personal level.  I have experienced very few books which, upon completion, I want to turn back to the front cover and begin again.  This is one of those books.  Thank you Rachel Joyce.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|It was good had a decent amount of funny parts but some slow parts also worth watching one time good for a couple to watch
B00000099Y|5.0|my favorite cd. but the quality was like new. no issues what so ever. i bought this over a year ago and can not remember if the book came with it. but this cd is in my cd player in my car right now, and plays good.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I hope this series runns for many years.  It is great.  I have the whole series and it is one that will not be lent out to friends.  It is staying right here with me!
1476734941|5.0|I've been on the diet for about a month and lost three pounds. Not much, but I'll take it. However, what impresses me the most about this plan is how it lowers my blood glucose levels. I have type II diabetes and take a low dose of medication to help manage it, along with a regular exercise routine. My A1C level was at 6.6 on 01/24/13. I got my results back from another A1C check on 04/23/13, and it was at 5.9! That is a significant drop for me, as I haven't been below 6.0 in many years. The only thing that I changed during the three month period is that I started this fasting diet. As someone who goes through diabetes burnout on occasion, this is so encouraging. Even if I never lose another pound, I will stick with this diet!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|its a really good game. runs great. they fixed the issue the had with running the game. it no longer freezes.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Ringside view of the life of folks at the cutting edge. The only narrative first person narrative of Osamas capture. What more is there to say!
0316056871|5.0|I bought this book on a whim at an airport a few months back.(sorry Amazon). I loved it. I swear I could hear Tina reading this. Gives a good insight of the struggles of making in as a comedian, the ups the downs, the weird. I remember I was mid flight reading this book. I was crying in laughter, I had to give myself a 30 minute break because I could not make it past the paragraph. The person sitting next to me must have thought I was crazy...
B000XUBC5E|4.0|I don't like murder mysteries, but I had to find out what happened. Keeps you turning the pages. The end
B001FB55L2|5.0|This is a very powerful movie!  The acting and direction is excellent.  I'm surprised it didn't pick up more awards.
B004JHY8A8|5.0|I just love it when you find a book that you just can't put down. Sarah's Key is such a book. Horrendously sad too when you think that this sort of thing actually happened.. Unimaginable pain and grief for all those affected.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|A classic that I've read many times, and enjoy every time.  Now I have it on my Kindle, and I'm sure I'll read it a few more times.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|A well written story of the possibilities for pragmatic IT folk, working in and with the wider business. While the plot was fairly predictably, it was still a good read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I Love this series. All of the books in this trilogy are great! I've read them all multiple times. Well written, great twists and of course Mr Grey.  :)
B00BF11STU|2.0|I believe the NO EASY DAY version.  This account focused on the intel gathering instead of the raid.  I am happy I didn't waste my money at the theater.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for horse lover's of any age. I could do without the constant interuptions caused by ads at the most inconvenient of times.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Very Good read, every page is a page turner, I couldnt leave it down. Cant wait to read part 3.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This show was funny, riveting, and entertainment throughout.  Its a keeper in my book and I am very picky on what I say that about
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book was really great...funny, interesting and moving.  And I loved all of the 80's references!  I enjoyed how the point of view went back and forth between the two main characters.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|If the director wanted a dismal movie, he succeeded.  I think it's poorly done and about as down as it gets.  I watched only about 5 minutes and could not stand any more.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Grab a pot of herbal tea and a whole box of chocolates! You're going to need them for this gut wrenching thriller. Imagine waking up each morning with totally no memory of who you are, any time or thing from any yesterday. I won't give away more of the story, but it grips and won't let go - even to sleep. I usually can predict the ending, but this one stumped me.  Hard to believe it's a first book for SJ Watson, and I sincerely hope there are lots more to come.  He's outstanding!
0062059963|3.0|As much as I really want to love this book, it has really been a disappointment thus far. I'm about half way through the book, and the only event of any importance was Marley's caning, and I could even see somthing like that happening. There is a formula that most teen romance books follow, and The Elite is no exception. Whoever the girl deciding spends the most time with in the first book will be the one that she chooses. In the Hunger Games, Katniss only spent a few chapters with Gale and many more with Peeta. Who did she choose? Bella spent the entire first book with Edward, and who did she choose? In Matched, Xander was only around cor a little of the book. Who did Cassia choose? This book will be no exception to the rule, and so Maxon's proposal to America is completely foreseeable.<br />Every time America asks for more time, I get the urge to rip out parts of my hair. She has spent the majority of the book so far crying in her room or waiting to be summoned, whether to the King, the Queen or Maxon.<br />And my last gripe: Maxon is acting completely out of character. I understand that he IS in a competition with (now) four other girls, and that he wants to give them a fair chance, but he has hardly given America a passing glance in this book. In addition, he seems to be manipulating America into being with him, rather than leaving it up to her.<br />All in all, I'm really sad about this book. Perhaps it is because my expectations were sky high after reading the Selection, or maybe the quality of writing has gone down. Either way, I am willing to stick with the series until the end, for the sake of curiosity.
B000092T6M|5.0|This is the best adaptation of the Robin Hood story. The costumes and acting are excellent. Also, pretty much anything Morgan Freeman is in is excellent. Even if he is a supporting actor in this film he adds so much to the film that without him the Kevin Costner character would be flat.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|this cd completes my box set and the price was right on the money very happy with it thanks a lot
B00AN0KGWE|3.0|Season 2 was good, but just didn't grab me like season 1 did.  And I watched season 1 after having read the book and knew what was coming (haven't read any of the other books yet).  There are a lot of characters and a lot of subplots which seemed to be managed pretty well in season 1.  It felt slower and just not as exciting in season 2.  I still plan to continue watching, just hoping that season 3 picks it up a bit.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Wonderful depiction of the struggles of alcoholism . I thoroughly enjoyed the video. I am an alcohol and drug counselor so it really was a good story for many to better understand challenges of addiction.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I can't wait to get my hands on book 5. Then I will be on to watching the HBO series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it. Couldn't wait to get home everyday and read what was coming next. Was sad to get to the end
0062059963|5.0|(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to HarperCollins publishers and Netgalley.)<br />This is book 2 in the `The Selection' series, and picks up where book 1 left off.<br />The 35 girls of `The Selection' have been reduced to just 6, and it's time for America to not only work to keep her place in the game, but to also make a decision as to who she really wants to be with - Prince Maxon, or her childhood sweetheart Aspen<br />The competition is also heating up, with some unexpected events, and more rebel action.<br />What do the rebels want? Who will be sent home next? And who will America choose?<br /><br />Beautiful and captivating, this book had me from the very first page!<br /><br />I loved `The Selection', and I was so excited to finally have a copy of `The Elite' to read, and I really was not disappointed. America continued to be not only the underdog of the competition, but also the one who truly seemed to have captivated the prince's heart. Her heart seemed to be in the right place in that she was always doing what seemed right to her, even if the things she did endeared her more to the lower castes than the king.<br /><br />The romance in this book was quite sweet, but I really wanted America to just make a decision and stick with it! It seemed obvious how America and Maxon felt about each other, so the fact that he was off flirting with the other 5 girls in the selection, and she was still making out with Aspen was a bit annoying! I really wanted Maxon to just propose, and send the other girls home instead of them constantly seeming to play games with each others feelings.  America also wore something which linked her to Aspen which for me was a really stupid thing to do, and the way she kept asking for more time was irritating too!<br />I have to say that if America and Maxon don't end up together by the end of this series I will be really annoyed!<br /><br />I liked the storyline in this book, and although America was a little immature and indecisive at times I couldn't help but love this story. I don't know what it is about these books but I really love the way they are written, and I actually think that `The Elite' was better than `The Selection'!<br /><br />Overall; I really loved this book, and although America had her faults, I hated to put this down! Can't wait for book 3!!! I want it now!!!<br />9 out of 10.
B005HSL626|3.0|Good, but partial game, I think that the full version would be  a lot better. I hope you like it a lot.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Anne's honest and heartful writing, sometimes heartbreaking since she shares her hopes and dreams of becoming a writer( little did she know how great she would become) had a special impact on me. She is an amazing writer,sharing the beauty of nature that can only be seen in glimpses from the inside. She has great insight-- writing about her varied companions, and even of herself, and even is able to weave humor into this sad and moving trial that the reader shares from afar, but yet feels close to her. This is a must reading for all Americans to be reminded of a not too distant atrocity, that could be felt world wide and personally, in the heart.
B000059T1G|4.0|I have been a huge traffic fan since early '70s.  This one oozes vintage Traffic.  It's probably my least fave (Mr Fantasy #1) but Shanghai Noodle Factory & Medicated Goo are great.
B0027REDK2|5.0|I have been looking for an original pressing of Rio on CD for the longest time.  This CD features the alternate mixes of &#34;Rio&#34; &#34;Hungry Like The Wolf&#34;, and &#34;Hold Back The Rain&#34;.  My only gripe (if you can call it a gripe) is that the so-called &#34;Carnival&#34; and &#34;Night&#34; remixes weren't cleaned up a little bit better than they were.  Otherwise, acoustic version of &#34;The Chauffeur&#34; was an excellent surprise as well as some of the other alternate mixes of the songs.  Again, if you are a DD fan and are on the fence about buying, DO NOT HESITATE!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|David is in my top five list of modern thriller authors!  His stories are wonderfully detailed and researched.  His character treatment makes you feel you know them well.  PLEASE don't get trapped in serial writing - stay the artist you are!

B0051UH6YM|5.0|Very nice for a non-native speaker, the book gives answers to long-lasting doubts about certain details of English language. Fun to read and try to understand all the fine nuances of using apostrophes, commas, colons, dashes, etc.

B0018QQQK8|3.0|This is my 1st Nicholas Sparks book. I've heard over & over again how fabulous his books are, so I guess I had really high expectations. I'm not going to lie, this book fell far short of my expectations. I liked the story, but had a hard time getting into it. It started off slow & didn't pull me in until I was halfway through it. I've never ever said this before, but I actually liked the movie better than the book. That's shocking to me because the book is always better than the movie, but not this time.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|Tried with ath-m50 with my Samsung note 2 and my laptop. This amp will increase the volume higher than the sources can normally go but since my ohone and laptop is already very loud with my m50s there was no point to increase the volume. It makes the sound slightly less clear because of a faint static sound. I really was hoping these would improve sound quality but im very disappointed and my m50 sound better without them
B00933JL0A|1.0|Played one time and got bored and forgot what tasks I was doing.  Could be a little faster paced and would be a better game.
B000VOC90Y|4.0|This feels like a top notch backpack. Same as my previous Swiss Gear bag - this is perfectly built with just the right number of pocket and high quality. It really feels rugged. By the feel of it I expect it would last years just like my previous Swiss Gear bag.<br /><br />I needed a new bag because I got a new 17&#34; computer and previous bag was only good for a 15&#34; laptop. I have a Dell M6600. It fits in the bag but the top corners of the laptop push sharply on the zipper. My 17&#34; Dell does not fully fit down in the pocket with extra clearance around it for the zipper. I am going to continue using it because I believe the quality of the zipper and everything is good enough that everything will hold up just fine even with the tight fit.<br /><br />The specs on the Dell M6600 are:<br />Width: 16.41&#34;/416.7mm<br />Depth: 10.65&#34;/270.5mm<br />Height: 1.3&#34;-1.46&#34;/33.1-37.4mm<br /><br />I would say if your computer measures anything less than these dimensions - then you are golden.<br /><br />Quality of this bag is far above all others I have looked at.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Such a fun show - beautiful costuming, fascinating reminder of history.  Some cheesy plotlines, I suppose,  but still worth watching it.

B0037NVM2C|5.0|Always a favorite to go back and watch. This version is a good one too with extra scenes fun stuff.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I loved this book! This book is awesome, extremely detailed and the perfect read for when you're bored. Happy reading
B00ANW33CM|4.0|I enjoy this particular game because it has 20 games at 4 different levels. So, you can choose how competitive you want to be. Each time you select a game (from one to twenty) the tiles are reshuffled. So if you pick level 2, game 5 and select that game three different times, you will get three different layouts of tile. A great travel game or just one you can lose yourself in for a few hours.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|i love the Hobbit series, the scenery is beautiful and the story is wonderful, i just love it a lot
B001OGWY1W|5.0|i love this movie. thanks for getting it here so fast. heath ledger is fantastic, and it's sad that he's dead, but i like watching this to remember him
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I love Rick's books. This is my 2nd  some rereading the series. When are you gonna finish the boys  of Hades
B00000DR5W|5.0|This excellent offering from Ryuichi Sakamoto was, for me, the departure point for his explorations of house, electronica, hip-hop and spoken word.  He followed this up with several excellent albums, but the seeds of his later work are all here.  Sparse instrumentation blending Japanese and West African traditional instruments with electronic elements and sampling, lyrics sung in multiple languages and a variety of singers from many different genres.  \\"Calling From Tokyo\\" is probably the first time I heard Japanese themes woven into an electronic/mid-tempo dance number.  I saw it here for sale at Amazon for a great price and my cassette tape was on its last legs, after 2 decades of regular play.  This LP is great!  I definitely recommend it.
B00006RAKP|5.0|This cd was better than I expected.  It brought back so many good memories from the past when life was so much easier.
B00A757EFW|3.0|This simulation of the old arcade favorite loses something in translation. The pac-man is a little difficult to control on a small screen and the lack of a joystick makes evasion a little tricky. It was okay, but having played the original it was too sluggish in finger response.
0553103547|5.0|I had to return the item for personal reasons.  When I did, I accidently left a personal item in the book.  The seller went above and beyond and not only returned my book, but also made sure I received my personal belongings that I had left in it.  Responses were always quick and they never hesitated to help me.  I will buy from here in the future.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|this was great and it came quickly and i really love this movie, so i am glad that i got it for such a low price!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|At first I was a little worried at what was to come, but the flow of the story was captivating - if it had been &#34;dead tree&#34; it would have been a real 'page turner' :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I absolutely love puzzles! This game was awesome. Totally worth your money. The only problem was that it is too short. :(
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|This movie essentially blew me away last night after watching it.<br /><br />I was torn, goosebumpy, quite a bit emotional with tears.... what a film, I tell ya!<br /><br />Highly recommended to watch. I definitely will buy this soon if the price ever<br />goes down. Don't feel like waiting too long to grab a copy.<br /><br />The PQ and AQ is very good. the storyline was great. the acting was superb!<br />such a tearjerker right here, you need to rent it to see for yourself.<br /><br />You will NOT be sorry! =)
B00881VLCE|3.0|While the puzzles are cute, they are not very challenging. It's a quick passtime or something that is more suitable for children.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed reading Gone Girl.  Very different than what I normally read. Took a few chapters to get into it, but once I did I couldn't put it down.
B008AX1HD8|3.0|Couldn't put it down and enjoyed the concepts behind the book but the translation was a bit stilted and odd in places.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|My chiropractor recommended I get this stand to elevate my laptop. I can feel the difference in terms of my sitting/working posture. And the stand itself is very portable, assembling and disassembling easily, and looking very fine beneath my Macbook Air. It's a very good thing.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I thought this was a great movie. Lots of fun stuff for the movie goer looking for that familiar format of a western, namely the shoot-outs. As a person who has never really thought about the slavery period in America or seen much regarding it, i found the movie helped me to understand the human plight better. It certainly helped me understand racism towards africans better.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|I did not expect all the bad language this movie used. The movie's story looked cute enough, but the language could have been toned down.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|An emotional book that taps the tragedy that is Ireland's heritage. I recommend the book strongly, it will pry away your callouses and touch your core.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Not a surprise that the movie wasn't as good as the book, but that being said, I did enjoy the movie. Some things make more sense if you have read the book (had to explain the three finger salute to someone) however many of my friends who hadn't read the book enjoyed the movie anyway. Overall, not a bad way to spend an evening.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I use the app, and it has been just fine. Not real sure what advantage it affords over just clicking on YouTube in the browser, though.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Best movie for 2012. Should have won a lot more Oscars, but competition was tough.  Delivered on time. Price high, but it WAS a new release, and we had to have it.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|After a long wait, episode 3.  But surely there must be another as we've been left hanging once again.<br />Whilst I enjoyed this, it does feel a bit like a lightweight holiday read.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Good film with many of my favorite British actors. How can you go wrong with Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Tom Wilkinson.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I CAN'T STOP PLAYING THIS GAME. EVERYTIME I STOP. TEN MINUTES LATER AM BACK ON TO SOLVE  ANOTHER LEVEL  AND GET THAT STAR.
B00BD62X14|3.0|I have several CD's of French songs so I thought this would be a nice addition to my collection.  Some of the songs are great but there are others that are too slow or not very musical.  I think the singer wrote all of the songs.  I wouldn't buy it again nor would I probably buy any more of her CD's.
B0000026TD|5.0|Andreas Vollenweider is one of my favorites for softer music. Andreas is truly a master. This cd is a great addition to my Vollenweider collection.
B000089RVR|5.0|A great voice and lyrics combined with fresh sounding tunes. I was very surprised when I first played this. I was only giving it a try to venture into a relm I was unfamiliar with. Well I got lucky. I loved the whole concept of the music. Great sound. Catchy lyrics and a smooth delivery. Her music sticks in my mind. I have purchased all but one of her albums and the last new one she has just released recently, I will either download or order on disc soon. These albums are now in my daily playlist.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book is wonderfully written and full of great detail about life in north Korea, a subject much in the news.  Intreastng insights about security and freedom, how much will one sacrifice of freedom to feel safe.  What is safe?  Brilliant story.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I don't read too many books that are dark.  This book was really good, Gone Girl was excellent.  The characters are developed in a way that makes you like them, feel sorry for them, and hate them.  I certainly didn't expect the outcome, but I wasn't surprised.  The story is so good that it over rides what you assume you may know.  I really enjoy Flynn' s books so far, she is very talented.  3 and a half stars.....
B009I2UH2W|4.0|This works great, I wish the head was bigger or longer so I can pull it out when it's done. It fits the plug just fine but the plug is recessed inside the ash tray so it's hard to get back out
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Well written and  in keeping  with other of author's  novels. A little slower moving than  his other  novels  but good  ..<br />I
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead has escaped the genre of flash-in-the-pan shows. You know, the show that's strong-premiere but weak-performance? The show remains delightfully, deliberately gritty--and throws in enough twists that even fans of the graphic novels won't know all the answers or be able to predict the plot. Critics of the show sometimes say it's a slow show; that's not wrong, but neither is it particularly relevant. There isn't dead time, excuse the pun, in The Walking Dead. Every shot, every scene, does something for the narrative arc. Highly recommend.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson is masterful at weaving this beginning of his epic series. He has left the characters beautifully poised for the next installment.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|A wonderful five-season, sci-fi ride.  Unique, well written scripts.  Awe inspiring.  Dramatic, romantic and funny.  A &lt;i>must see&lt;/i> for all science fiction fans.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Lots of fun find anything you can imagine. Lots of great ideas. Can't put it down sometimes for hours and hours. Find new things daily.
B000B589JI|3.0|I thought this would be great to put in my EDC bag as a back up for my zippo. The idea is great... unfortunately it leaks! I found another review where someone found that a faucet washer would resolve that issue... I have yet to try that but will do so. If the canister did not leak, then it would be a 5 star product.
0307592731|5.0|Cheryl Strayed has a great way of pulling you into her book and keeping your interest.  I love writers who have hard times and share with us how they got through it.  She make a goal and stuck to it.  Loved her book.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I hate acapella, and I have no attention span. I loved this movie anyway. In particular, Rebel Wilson and Anna Kendrick are phenomenal. While I enjoyed Bridesmaids and can't claim this is *AS* funny or a perfect heir(ess), this is a continuation of some of the most laudable features of Wiig's movie: it's a really strong female-led comedy that doesn't attempt to cram itself into the dominant masculine model of humor. (Note: It's cleaner than I would have expected, but still relatively dirty--it's Rebel Wilson, after all.)
B00A4OALL0|5.0|(I also posted this same review in the Joe Lovano and Us Five album \\"Cross Culture\\" reviews) Blue Note pulled a major coup when they issued these two albums. It was a one-two punch that knocked me out.  I've been lying on the canvas with little Xs for eyes this past week ever since I got these CDs.<br /><br />I'm not even going to presume to critique these artists, I am just going to give you some random thoughts on the fly.  Wayne and Joe belong to a category of artists that started out creating inside the box but have learned how to transcend it.  Other artists over the decades of jazz have pushed at the walls of the box, or stuck their head out for a minute, or jumped out and ran around naked and flipped us the bird, and many others have escaped the box only to turn around and spend all their time kicking and abusing the box.  All this has lead to the box expanding to include all the innovations that have come around over the years.  That is what jazz has always been about, stretching those limits, even though there are purists who have to have fences to feel comfortable and safe.  Wayne's career especially, and just the way he plays and talks, shows that he will be nobody's tamed entertainer.<br /><br />Wayne and Joe, are artists that have come to be so comfortable inside or outside the box, that they move in and out effortlessly. They are ghosts for whom the walls of the box mean nothing. They are Holy Ghosts who, frankly I don't think even know the box is there.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Hey guys, this is an amazing app....I love it and hope you do too txt me at irishgirl003 enjoy the app...  :)
B005K17RU0|5.0|Gives me good information for any location.  From hourly to 10 day forecast.  It is easy to use.  I use it all the time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love watching this whole season on my Kindle...anytime, anyplace.  It is so convenience to be able to watch my favorite show over and over, when I choose!

B00881PTRC|5.0|I love this app I play it almost every day I would recommend you get this app awesome amazing app best one
B008AUGEFC|4.0|I can't stop thinking about this book.  It was not an easy read, or a quick one, but it was unlike any book that I've ever read.  The format is very unique, with the first half of six different stories told in the first half of the book, and the endings of each story told in reverse order for the second half of the book.  Each one has a different format (journal entry, letters, Q&A, etc.) and was written for a different time period.<br /><br />When I finished Sonmi's story, I was rather shaken and amazed by its impact on the future world.  The rest of the book was somewhat anti-climactic, but it's interesting to think back on all the connections and implications the rest of the chapters had on the book as a whole.<br /><br />I'm interested to see how this book was made into a movie (the trailer gave me chills after I read the book) and I look forward to discussing this at book club!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a hard game to put down. I just keep telling myself one more. And before you know it another hour has gone by.
0756666937|5.0|She is really into legos and she drags this book everywhere. It has inspired her to want to create sets of her own intstead of using predesigned sets such as creator or lego friends.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|Great albums are far and few right now. Laura Mvula is an INSTANT CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!! I can NOT wait until she comes to Detroit!!
B00867GKIK|5.0|I'm a fan of all things Disney and all things Pixar but this movie certainly ranks in my top 5.  Pixar manages to tell an amazing story weaving through an amazing love story along with 2 coming of age stories.  It's easy to see how/why this movie won awards.<br /><br />In addition to all of the above are the plethora of non-human characters...Doug is my favorite (by far)!
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Pretty nifty moves throughout the entire course of the film. Not boring at all, even when watched for the second time.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|What a difference this makes in the still pictures and the videos, my husband has taken on his dives in the Gulf.  He is so pleased with the way it works.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Oh man, I have not one complaint of this movie whatsoever.  I have been looking for this movie every time I go into an electronics/movie store, but I have NEVER found it, until finally my friend suggested I go on amazon, DUH!  once i got past my stupidity, I received it in the mail, and it brought back so many warm memories.  Its actually a funny movie, with dark and sad parts too.  Its perfect for kids, but I truly believe adults would like to watch this movie with thier kids as well.  I am 25 and watch this movie with my 28 year old sister, and we both love it.  It has great music, a great cast, and has the same basic story of the original, but with some fun things for the kids.  I recommend this movie to every living person on earth, as it is my all time favorite christmas movie, but its kinda hard to find, so AMAZON PEOPLE!
030758836X|3.0|I enjoyed the basic plot of the story and would have liked it much better without the &#34;f&#34; word every other word. The underlying plot was the only thing that kept me going. I am 75 and really prefer the old fashioned type of stories written without all this new accepted language!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Accuracy and detail are classic Clancy with modern geopolitical perspective.  John Clark has matured and Jack Ryan assumes the mantle.  Great read.
B004KZOXJA|5.0|you must read the others in this trilogy. not the most likeable of characters but you keep getting drawn in nevertheless.
B005KELW26|5.0|I absolutely love this case. It works so well. Definitely worth the money. I can carry it like a clutch and take it everywhere.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I'm able to relax.  Sometimes I fall asleep.  It is a great product. Plus they even put in a timer.
B00932A2MC|3.0|The movie wasn't that great the plot was just as dry as the acting, but the instant watch program is awesome didn't even have to leave the house to see the movie.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|This movie was very entertaining right from the start.  When it started with the titles and music, I was taken aback.  I wondered why the music sounded like spaghetti western music from the 60's and 70's.  Well turns out that was exactly what they intended.  I quickly saw, that it was a spoof of westerns of that time period.  There was a lot of everything in this movie.  Most points except the conditions of slavery, were very exaggerated on purpose, to the point of being more exaggerated even than the 60's and 70's they were spoofing, but that's what made many scenes funny.  (The shooting scenes were WAY over the top bloody)  and if you know anything at all about firearms, you can see that these scenes are clearly not meant to be an accurate depiction of what happens when someone gets shot.  Therefore, more spoofing on spaghetti westerns, WAY  more spoofing.  So even though it was blood soup and blood explosions at times you can see, once you get past the initial shock of the scene, what they are doing.  The scene with the mob of hooded (ku Klux clan type) riding out to go after django and the bounty hunter, was quite funny,  silly, to be sure, but funny. (I am speaking here of the dialog that took place concerning the hoods they were wearing.)  So, if your looking for a very serious commentary on slavery, this isn't the movie for you.  If your looking for a movie that is just entertaining and you don't get all freaked out by blood, you will find this movie to be engaging.  All portrayals of all the parts are exaggerated, with the exception  of  the part that DiCaprio plays as the plantation owner of Candyland.  He is as debase as they come in the part, and I dare say, just cracking the surface of what went on there, but it is primarily a movie about revenge against the plantation owners and a statement about not just the physical misery slaves went through but the extreme and deliberate mental torture slaves went through.  So, if you just want to be entertained, you will be that.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Is what it is, have always used artic silver.  Never a complaint.  Used on macs, ibm, dell, lenovo, etc.  Used on both desktops and laptops.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, though took a little while to get into the outgoing lead character. Loved the storyline and plot, and the adventures that he encountered along the way, and the interaction with earth.  Quite a few laughs, and a few tears.
B001G50SLE|5.0|Great writers and superb actors--overall story is compelling, and the stand alone episodes are cleverly written.  Characters are well developed and fascinating.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|I'm not sure I am a good one for this game.  I cannot quite get the hang of it.  I will probably never progress with this game.  I cannot personally recommend it.
0345528581|5.0|This book is great for anybody looking to get in shape on a budget or want to take their fitness game to new heights.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|We got into this after the season and hype had started. Enjoyable characters and interesting storyline. The costumes and scenery are just glorious.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|sorry i just want to tell you i love the cd but i didnt get the one i ordered so i was really bummed about that and i dont know how to let them no about it  . i have the bank papers of the day and how much i paid for it .. it says in the return if its been opened it cant be return so i guess im  not going to get the other songs that were on the deluxe edition.  sorry not happy with this one because of the mistake on the regular cd over paying for the deluxe edition  sorry
0606238433|3.0|I've only just started reading the story.  What has me annoyed is the manner in which the book was made.  This book is simply a regular sized paperback, with a glossy hardcover without a dust jacket.  The pages are thin lightweight paper, and the print is small.  A library binding edition, used to be a high quality product.  From now on I'll make a point of checking the book dimensions in the fine print of the description.
1607066017|2.0|Am I the only one who thought this book was poorly written? The story moves at break neck speed. Characters make huge emotional leaps in just a few panels, and the dialogue is very, very on the nose. I like the story itself and kind of want to keep reading just for the story, but with such obvious dialogue its very hard to take it seriously. The artwork is fantastic though.
B007REV4YI|4.0|This was one of the better Bond movies. Definitely significantly better than Quantam of Solace (the second Daniel Craig movie).
B0085A9J18|5.0|Great movie with nonstop action from beginning to end this movie will have you scarred and excited to see more at the same time.
B004SRNH10|1.0|I have no use for it even though it says I do. What exactly does it do on Coby Tablet? I haven't been able to find out why it doesn't work. I will delete it very soon. Please find out how it helps the mobile equipment work.
B00BMCLCG6|4.0|I like all the tunes on this new album and find it enjoyable to listen to.  A very good product overall.
B00CAJP0ZO|5.0|Whole album is good, just press play!<br />I got it on sale for $5, so the value is awesome.<br />Only weird thing is that the tracks no longer show the names of the featured artists.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Kept us involved throughout the entire movie.  Even made my wife cry.  I would watch it again sometime.  All the actors in this movie are amazing actors and they did not dissapoint.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|This was a great movie. The singing was great by all the leads and the quality of the movie was excellent.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I love movies that keep me on my toes, and The Lincoln Lawyer does just that! It has a few nice little twists that you never see coming and the actors are great! Highly recommend!
B000EF5NAS|5.0|This is a fantastic movie for all ages. The times of friends and family and small towns. I am an avid movie collector and buying from Amazon is the best. I try to find the hard to get or older movies and am replacing old vhs. This movie again a period piece and just a great family movie...the book is a must have must read as well by Fanny Flag. When making movies was great. The extras on the dvd make this a special addition.
B005PK57NU|5.0|The Good Wife kept me from completing any household chores. I kept telling myself I'd just watch one more episode but then...the cliff hanger at the end had me repeating &#34;just one more episode&#34;.
014050639X|5.0|I remember reading this to my little brother so I had to get it for my son. The pictures are beautiful and the story is a lot of fun. Even though my 10 mo old can't &#34;spy&#34; yet he likes to listen to me read him this book and I enjoy it too.
030758836X|1.0|This book was recommended by a couple of friends. The characters are selfish, unlikeable people. It was slow to start.  I only finished it because I had devoted so much time into reading it and  because it was such a best seller.  I felt it was a total waste of my time.  I guess I like books where I can relate to at least one of the characters. The characters in this book are horrible people. Wish I would never have read it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I urge all interested in a plausible, interesting, intelligent read to look no further than &#34;The Martian&#34;. This &#34;What-if&#34; Hypothetical exercise is something every person thinks about in one way or another...&#34;What if I were trapped, alone with no one to help me...&#34; It's the ultimate castaway scenario.<br /><br />The interesting thing here is this novel is plausible! I'm sure it could be used as a training exercise for astronauts faced with the ultimate scenario for survival. The science is not overwhelming and the reader is quickly drawn in as they identify with the character. You are literally transported to Mars and sitting next to this hapless castaway fighting to survive with only your dwindling supplies and your brain to keep you alive!<br /><br />This is meaty fare for those looking for an intelligent read which stays with you throughout your day as you ponder what you would do in such a situation. I couldn't wait to get back to reading from lunch hours, train commutes and last light reading before bed.<br /><br />If any book deserves a film adaptation...THIS IS THE ONE! After exhaustive pondering on who the starring role should go to I decided the best Actor to carry this off issssss...(Drum roll please...) RUFUS SEWELL!<br /><br />That's Right! Rufus Sewell has the acting chops, aesthetic intelligence appeal and LOOKS like an astronaut. Rufus Suwell has that pensive &#34;Wheels-Turning-in-His-Head&#34; appearance which would carry very well in such a film based on mental exercise. His light of heart and demeanor would be perfect to reflect the positive moral needed to sustain the necessary hope required during such an arduous task.<br /><br />A Celebrity Du Jour would be all wrong for this role. After his roles in &#34;The Eleventh Hour&#34; and &#34;Zen&#34; a thoughtful, intelligent person would be the perfect fit for this role. I am certain...&#34;The Martian&#34; was written just for Rufus Sewell.<br /><br />However, if you want a little more diversity for this role; I would consider casting Mark Consuelos, Joe Morton or John Lone. However, Rufus Sewell would be my first pick.<br /><br />Hey Rufus! (Waving my Arms...) Call your agent and tell him/her to get off their ass and start making phone calls!<br /><br />Download this eBook and get up to speed on the story-line ASAP! This was made for you, Bro!!!

0486475824|4.0|I really needed this book and it was everything that I expected. It was a little tattered but well worth the money paid.
B00BJDARGO|2.0|I was very hopeful when I saw this scheduled for release... and a bit less excited when I picked it up at Best Buy today and noted barely a dozen tunes (not counting drum and guitar solos listed as songs).  When you can buy the latest Scorpions set on BR which is a full 2+ hour concert and another nearly half hour of bonus features .....this barely over an hour set with virtually nothing in bonus features seems more suited for a VHS release rather than DVD or .... Blu Ray.  The Whitesnake show on DVD from a few years back [[ASIN:B000E0OEVW Whitesnake Live: In the Still of the Night (Deluxe Edition + CD)]] has this one beat on just about every count and would have made a great BR entry for Whitesnake.  Another bummer is that the DVD can be purchased with a two CD bonus set up while the BR is bare bones?  Even though it was short and lacking in features I gave in to my desires for some more great Rock video and brought it home today... only to be terribly let down by the actual footage and performance in comparison to the previously noted show.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to get the 2 CD / DVD set for less money .... I wish I had .. rather than buy this half show blu ray.  Another complaint of mine is when the artist/group leads a sing along during one of their best tunes ... I know they enjoy that but I didn't buy a BR of a Whitesnake concert to hear a Japanese audience singing their finale ... it was however a terrific way for this let down of a disc to end.<br /><br />I like Coverdale and Whitesnake, but can't give this BR any more than half a full rating of 5 stars as this is half a show and no extras.... sorry.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|Best pick me up ever.  It is one of the shows I will never get tired of. I watch bits and pieces all the time.
0062059963|5.0|so got book2 of the selection series because I wanted to give it a try. the first one was missing something, just the whole book seemed to smiple. to easy to understand the whole book. the 2nt one, through some thing's where to much forshadowing.  I liked it more. there was more attack's more edge to the relationship of America and the prince and her ex. also more of her showing she could be a princess. But I hope I don't give anything away when I say, who else want's to hit the King really hard? like into a wall hard? looking forward to The One. Also if anyone doesn't know there is an ebook called the Prince. haven't read it , but letting those people who like the series know.<br /><br />By the way got this on 4/25/13 and finished in within hour's. :)
B00BJS7104|4.0|This movie is in your face. It has a lot of violence and blood shed. The action never stops. But so do a lot of movies. The thing that singles this movie out from the others is the fact that it brings back the atrocity of slavery and reminds us of a past that many would like to forget, but should not be. The black people of that time were treated as possessions, not human. Watching the characters evolve into a hero is very good for the soul. And seeing things as they were less than one hundred and fifty years ago is horrifying. The struggle of the protagonist to find and free his loved one had me rooting for him and feeling his frustration. This movie is daring, and very bold in its true depiction of the struggle some Americans had in becoming part of our modern world. I would recommend that everyone of age see this story. It's a real eye opener.
174179918X|4.0|The book was really helpful in getting us started in planning our trip to Korea.  We found the information upto date and relavent.  On the ground when we got to Korea it helped us find our way to various places via public transport.  We went to many places because they were mentioned in the book that we may not have found on our own.  Congratulations Lonely Planet on another good guide book.<br /><br />On the negative side we found the index a little sparse.
B004L3AR0K|2.0|Started watching this film and my partner and I shut it off.  It's just not our type of movie.<br />You might like it; read the reviews.<br />Service getting DVD was fine.

B00008J2DQ|5.0|This band has a driving sound that draws me in. The sound mixing they do makes my stero come alive!! I was hooked from the first time I heard ' I STAND ALONE' The raw power in the vocals is just mesmerizing. Their sound is the equivalent of a thunder storm coming through my ear buds. I feel goose bumps rise. Godsmack means awestruck...Well, that about sums it up for me. BEWARE: Their sound can blow stock speakers! I kid you not!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The graphics are good and they grab the childs attention right away BUT the gems are very difficult to earn which prevents them from 'buying' certain ponies.  I do not allow them on Facebook which takes out another whole set of ponies.  They have not allowed any other way to earn the heart shaped gems (for social media sharing) for users that don't have Internet access to social media.  Also the 'balloon pop' game is fun but charging 10 gems for 1 single extra balloon is ridiculous based on how hard it is to earn the gems in the first place.  The gem price of the most popular ponies is insane - you would need to play this for years in order to earn enough gems to buy the prince and princess along with Princess Celestia.  These 3 ponies together cost 2,250 gems.  You might be lucky to earn 10 gems a day if you are on it all day long.  How about rewarding the user for playing with the ponies by giving a gem at the completion of each star OR better yet intersperse gems with the coins in the flying game at the completion of each star to allow the user to boost their gem balance a little.  PLEASE, PLEASE update this app to allow younger children to stay engaged with this and be able to purchase the ponies easier.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I think it's a great app...Really good to use if you're traveling...I like it a lot and would recommend it to friends.
B000FA675C|5.0|I've read this book twice and I liked it even better the second time. One of those books that I just didn't want to put down. Too bad we have to sleep and work and .....
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I pre-ordered this (AMAZING) movie. I love that Amazon does the price match and refunds you if the price drops when the movie actually comes out. It is nice because I do not look into that, they just do it. Such a nice perk!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Chbosky, in the form of letters to a friend, tells a coming of age story about the pressures of being a teenager; sex, drugs, beer, fitting in, etc. It sounds a bit cliche, but it has great meaning to it. I loved the unique writing style and the characters. I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone, especially young adults.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Awesome product, I got nearly 5 full charges on my iPhone 5. Went camping a couple weeks ago and couldn't have worked better. Durable and safe. I would definitely buy again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I play it on my Kindle Fire every night ti help me relax and unwind.<br /><br />I like the different levels and I find it challenging as well as getting the grey cells moving.
B004B8DH98|5.0|This is a great movie. Please be advised that this is more of an artistic movie and is shot in a European style. This is far from a bad thing if you can appreciate it. However, if you are looking for an action packed thriller, this is not it. There is a lot of character building (albeit, this does not necessarily clarify things, but rather intrigues you more on the enigmatic nature of George Clooney's character.) This movie is somewhat slow to start, but it ends quite well. I don't find myself becoming bored like some European style movies because there is enough excitement to keep you watching. If you are looking for a toned back, yet uncannily manly movie (He builds a rifle suppressor with rudimentary tools in a small apartment by hand. Myself included, many men would dream of being this manly.), this is definitely one to watch.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book would really like to find more like it. Hate to have to wait on the third one

B001UTW7QU|5.0|I am a true fan of ,&#34;The X-Files&#34;, when Fringe came along I was equally enthused. Now there is Torch wood! WTF! However, fringe is like X-Files on steroids. I love Fringe as much as I love x-Files. Torchwood is a spin-of the two.
B003E2UQMS|5.0|This was one of the books that I just couldn't put down. Real characters plus unique story line = winner!
B00009RDG9|5.0|I'm also REAL BIG FAN of Tommy Lee Jones and this Movie Is Great I recommend it to everyone Thank You Very Much
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|There have been many movies about President Lincoln.  Before Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal my favorite movie was Young Mr. Lincoln (1939) with Henry Fonda.  The reason was because they didn't make Lincoln into a overly serious stiff statue.  Lincoln's life was so complex.  He was a ruthless politician, humble country lawyer, loving father and suffering husband to name a few roles.  The 2012 movie Lincoln is the first to capture all these personalities.  And by focusing on the last few months of his life they also show how his undying faith in man and the Union led us during our darkest and most difficult days.  This is not necessarily an 'entertaining' movie.  But, it will show you a slice of history that far too many of us don't know that much about. And, are at risk of forgetting.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Let me tell you this is the best movie I have ever seen and I have seen over a dozen times at least. What makes this movie great is that the Dark Night is not about Batman, its about the Joker. Its about the Joker and how Batman fights to save Gotham City from this &#34;Mad Dog.&#34; although Bruce Wayne is the main character its all about the Joker. The Joker is the best villain ever. Heath Ledger did the most amazing job of playing America's most loved villain who just wants to watch the world burn. Sadly, if you don't know already, Heath Ledger (the Joker) died during the production of the fill. He died after the filming but during the special effects and never say himself become the most popular bad guy ever on the big screen. He died sadly of a cocktail accident and this makes this movie even more a legend. (the third movie &#34;The Dark Night Rises was originally going to star the Joker again. HE was in the script and every thing but sadly he died.)

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|awesome and really crude, its got some funny parts and this is a movie for any family guy fan. and its crude
B00B1CGDTS|5.0|This last team-up of Wayne and O'Hara tells a westernized, loosely-based version of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, minus the usual western scenery of a Wayne film. A broad (and by today's standards, un-PC) comedy sprinkled with little bits of serious consideration about economics, male/female relations, and the treatment of Native Americans.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Very nice read, concise and Intresting. As i did not know anything about nikola tesla this was a very cool read.

B009FZFONO|5.0|Great show needs to stop doing the mid season breaks.  Keeps you in suspense every week, cannot wait until season 4 comes out. Great story line and huge following for it.
B00AJLHU3K|4.0|. . . I could have stood a little more of the Master's incendiary guitar work.  I know Mr. Thompson values economy - but if you name your album &#34;Electric&#34; - and you have the guitar pedigree this guy does - you don't need to scrimp on the guitar playing.  I bought this thinking I'd have to have my eyebrows penciled-in after the first listening, but no such fireworks.  It'd be nice just once to hear Richard take his on-stage guitar freak into the studio with him for a good, long (double-CD!) workout.<br /><br />The songs are uniformly excellent - just what you'd expect - and I like the production; it's loose and open.<br />Surprisingly, the bonus disc has some of the set's best material.  So . . . if you're gonna shell out for this one, I'd advise to go for the deluxe.<br /><br />Definitely not a bad record by any stretch - heck, no Richard Thompson work falls into that category - I just wish there had been more guitar freakery, complete with eyebrow-erasing solos.
B003L7861E|5.0|This was a book club read.  I found the characters interesting.  I especially liked learning about the Indian culture and cuisine.  Hassan's journey from Mumbai to London to Lumiere to Paris was filled with a mix of  love and loss.  The clash of cultures in Lumiere and the Madame Mallory character in particular made learning about haute French cooking<br />very interesting, giving a glimpse of a disappearing dining experience.

B00AYR2FOI|5.0|. . . Boz just keeps getting better & better.  Known for his 70's masterwork Silk Degrees, Boz has quietly served up a nice body of work in latter stages of the 20th and now into the 21st century.  A voice that should be listed among our official National Treasures, Boz sounds like no one and has aged better than most of his contemporaties.  His vocal control alone separate him from the pack - nevermind his endless well of soul & grit.<br /><br />The songs here - some you'll know, some you'll think you know, some you won't - are given the Boz Treatment, and all benefit from his magic.  Of particular note are his slower, more regal takes on the classics &#34;Love on a Two-Way Street&#34; and &#34;Can I Change My Mind&#34;, both of which outstrip the originals - no easy feat.  Throw in versions of &#34;Rainy Night in Georgia&#34; and the Steely Dan chestnut, &#34;Pearl of the Quarter&#34; - both every bit as good as the originals (again, not easy to do) - and you see that this isn't Rod Stewart cashing in on a fad.  These covers fit the singer and were carefully thought out.  The performances bring to mind Memphis soul great Al Green and his own &#34;Memphis Mafia&#34; - and for good reason; many of those involved in Rev. Green's best works are on board here.  The surprise is just how well Boz picks up the baton and runs with it.
0316010669|4.0|This is the first book by Gladwell that I read, so I cannot comment on the fact that most people seem to think that this is the author's weakest book.<br /><br />The book is full of interesting stories, which made me refer to the notes on several occasions. It really makes you think. ==> Five stars.<br /><br />He writes very well. Most pop science books are rather verbose. For some reason Gladwell is able to pull off being equally wordy but without seeming verbose. I don't know how he does it. Part is probably due to the fact that he tells most of his stories as mysteries. That is another reason for my high score. ==> Five stars.<br /><br />The weakest part of the book is its thesis. Something like: We can make snap decisions in complex situations and those decisions are often correct, if we have the relevant training. The training often takes years. This is fine, but a little bit weak for a whole book. I would have liked more elaboration of the training requires, when snap decisions are prone not to work, etc. So in terms of content this book is not very organised ==> Two stars.<br /><br />I will give the book four stars because it is a delight to read and it had made me think about several (unrelated) topics. One star deducted by the rather poorly structured underlying message.
B00B23O96A|5.0|As always Clapton never lets you down . His reworking of Further on Down the Road is AWSOME as well as all the others..
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I think this was by far the best James Bond ever made and plan to purchase a copy. Daniel Craig does an excellent job of making Bond more human, more rough around the edges and the relationship between Bond and M is priceless. Finally, seeing the empty shell from which the young Bond emerged into the current 007 agent was so carefully constructed by the filmmakers and the scenery is incredible. You get a true sense of where Bond's loyalty to M has come from. Although the picture is rather dark, it is also beautiful in so many ways.
1451620829|3.0|Once you get past the tales of debauchery (which, really has been overdone with the KISS member \\"tell-alls\\" and other various musical biographies), it is a good source for some behind-the-scenes politics in one of the most successful and entertaining acts of the modern Rock era. As you further yourself through the book, you might find yourself wondering why Peter didn't just walk away and stay away from his former band. Seemingly, many of his struggles and downfals in life, were brought on by his reluctance to sever the ties between himself and KISS. Still, this book gives a lot of fresh insight, from Peter's perspective, even for old KISS fans. (I personally, could have done without a few of the beans that were spilled...especially in regard to Ace. Some things are better left unsaid.) If you've read books released in the past few years from Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley and Chris Lendt, you will probably feel like me...\\"Can we just skip the tales of debauchery at this point? The other guys beat ya to it!\\" Good read for Peter Criss fans, though.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|I'm afraid I cannot comment on the entire 'movie' due to the fact that I could only tolerate it through the ghastly Troll scene. But here goes.<br />While the 'movie' did not start out following the book in the very beginning, it did a terrific job of setting the stage for the adventure that followed by laying out the historical groundwork.  Despite the occasional quotes from the book and the odd blunder into accuracies here and there (I believe that was Weathertop in the background right before the Troll incident), the movie makes a most unfortunate turn into the dark side.  The trolls didn't act as they did in the book and the purse didn't talk and Gandalf made them argue amongst themselves while the morning sun rose (in the book).  To say nothing of throwing the unfortunate Radagast under the bus in an earlier segment.  Peter made him look like a rum-soaked half wit bleeding heart tree hugger bereft of any power save that of making us all laugh.<br />Sorry folks, but that was as much as I could tolerate of the shredding of a most noble story.  I hit the eject button and pondered the value of grinding the offending disk into silver dust.  Truth be told, I generally would prefer to eat a book than read it (sorry Worf) but when I picked up the Trilogy and later the Hobbit (yes, backwards, but it worked out just as well) in 1976 just to silence my college friends, I was instantly transformed into a world I would never ever tire of.  What I saw last night was the pillaring of an old friend and I had not the stomach for it.  I dearly wanted to see Elrond and Smaug and the battle of 5 Armies and riddles in the dark but Peter had other ideas.
B009EAALII|3.0|This was a DVD taken from a recent PBS special. The PBS show was great! This DVD, however, leaves a little bit lacking from the original Beyond the Sun concert and A LOT lacking in the \\"bonus feature/special guest\\" catagory. The \\"bonus freature\\" is mearly a repeat of the last chapter of the concert and for those of us who saw the PBS show, the Wanda Jackson live performance is TOTALLY missing! Big rip!

B005LAIHPE|1.0|Rarely does a movie this stupid and corny make it on to the big screen. The last time that happened was when Transformers 2 and 3 made it. This movie will appeal to idiots. Rihanna is in nearly every scene. Her lines are never more than 4 words. She's only there to attract idiot dollars. The main character is revealed to be a complete moron of poor character in the first 10 minutes but he's basically risen to the rank of commander in the NAVY 20 minutes later. He also gets into fist fights despite being of such high rank. What a moron. The scientists in the movie are portrayed as spineless idiots while the soldiers display unwavering courage and intelligence. It's a nice advertisement for the armed forces - again, much like Transformers 2 and 3. Avoid this one.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I  don't like alpha numeric keyboards.  However,  since few smartphones offer physical keyboards these days,  an app like  this  makes the on screen keyboard so much more tolerable.  SwiftKey learns your writing 'style' to the point where you almost don't have to type because it knows what words you need next.  A huge improvement over the standard keyboard input that comes with the phone.
B000AJIF4E|1.0|Right off the bat, for an $80 pair of headphones they sound the same as a $30 pair of studio monitors from Audio-Technica. Mediocre-sounding at best. You can get the same quality with a less-expensive model from a different brand. Though, I do like the coiled cord.<br /><br />I open the box, It smells like burnt plastic. I see a partially melted right ear pad. The blue \\"Professional\\" stamp they used is all sticky and melted. Not good.<br /><br />These SonyMDR7506 studio headphones look and feel like a knock-off; a cheap construction of low-grade plastic and metal. It looks as if someone had rushed to get this one off the assembly line. The box insert reads, \\"Made in Thailand,\\" not that it makes a difference. Sony probably wanted to cut costs in manufacturing.<br /><br />Recently, I had spoken with Crawford Superstore, a vendor that Amazon offers. They explained that \\"Our products get 'co-mingled' with other products of other vendors at Amazon.\\" A little sketchy, I'd say. I highly recommend going to an actual store (e.g. Guitar Center) for these kinds of purchases.<br /><br />Sony makes legitimate products nonetheless. However, when I order a brand-new, brand-name, piece of pro-audio equipment, I expect it to be new, made with quality, and function properly.

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I've seen Javier Bardem in many movies way before we Americans &#34;discovered&#34; him but he was at his best in this even better than in his oscar winning performance, IMHO.  Daniel Craig, again, one of his best and my girl, Dame Judi is good in ANYTHING she does!  My favorite, of course, is the last part when they go to Skyfall, the action is unbelievable!  All throughout the movie, the action is unbelievable, love the comedic quips, and we Bond fans were given just enough Bond memorabilia to keep us entertained as in the part played by the ever-loving Aston-Martin.  I loved this movie...have been watching 007 since Sean Connery!

B00BUCW54Q|4.0|This is the movie equivalent of an airport novel that keeps you turning the pages and you enjoy every second until the end. The film uses the airport novel tactic of building tense scenarios and then moving everything around every few minutes to keep the story fresh. Of course, after you know the whole story it doesn't play backwards particularly well since it seems like an overly-complicated plot after you've seen the twists and turns.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is an interesting if one-dimensional hero who comes out of nowhere, acts outsides the boundaries of the law and uses his near-supernatural intelligence to separate the good guys from the bad. Still, with Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects) directing, it's tightly paced and keeps the action moving so you'll rarely stop to notice some of the craziness of what's happening. Cruise is quite good as always although he can practically phone in the performance on this one. The main villain is somewhat weak cinematically but fortunately he doesn't have enough screen time for us to question his believability for too long<br /><br />No doubt it's made enough money to guarantee that the rest of the original novels will get turned into a franchise. It's not as exciting as the Bourne series but definitely well made and easy to watch.

B00846WWVM|3.0|its frustrating and I feel like its too touchy, sometimes the water will react to my touch one way and then not another time! I gave up after 5 rounds and deleted...so if you are looking for a challenging game this IS for you!!!!! I like mindless games better.
0684857219|3.0|Doctor recommended to my husband.  Not sure why now, as he is NOT a body builder...... just in need of regular exercise with a few weights and nutrition.  We did like the nutrition part, but few pages to digest on this..... too many pictures of Arnold.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|The movie is  depressing and rather uninteresting.  Sex was involved coincidently and so was love.  I would not recommenbd this movie.  Denzel was as usual, very good.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Star Wars, the original saga. Empire Strikes Back, still the best. It's Star Wars, nuff said.<br />Don't wreck it Disney.
B004478AS4|5.0|I was inspired to read this again when I heard that Chinua Achebe had passed recently. And I was just as impressed with the book this time around - it is so complex and yet the writing is simple and classic with no words wasted. The story places the reader in a far-away culture and in the mind of a leader of another time. This is my Shakespeare.
B00B4804KS|5.0|My first take on this review was ruined by a lack of explanation as to how to get out of the \\"screen saver\\" when you pause the movie.  Now that that's taken care of I have absolutely no complaints about this bluray.<br /><br />The movie looks amazing in 3D and HD.  It's like it was made for it.  The clarity is beautiful.  A great way to revisit this classic.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Storyline is very exciting and intriguing.  Actors are superb.  You have to stay with it to keep up. Very worthwhile.
1401324649|3.0|A very old man in a retirement home decides he'd rather not attend his own birthday party when he turns 100. Can you blame him? So, out the window he goes. Taking off from there, you join in the adventure as Allan Karlsson encounters new people, places and lots and lots of good luck (as it turns out). History buffs will be delighted upon discovering that the author weaves interesting events from the past to give an odd look into how a man like Allan may have influenced politics and world leaders. You never know what's been in someone else's past. Everyone has their story - and I'm sticking to that.
B0062EKXKK|5.0|When Steve joined the band everything changed. Multi-ranged voice. Arnel is the only one that can replace him..thanx guys love it
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|A real Good book that opens your eyes to North Korea  and make  you appreciate life in America.  Must read.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Hard to rate a product not personally used but my grandsons seemed to love it.  It was in their Easter basket and a great option to more candy.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I loved the humor and the wonderful dogs in this book.  This one of favorites by this author and I've read everything she has published, many more than once.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This song was well worth the wait.  Simply cannot wait for the rest of the album.  Daft Punk is back!
0763644765|5.0|Love the book. Hard pages keep it from being destroyed. My 1 and a half year old daughter picks that book off of the shelf to enjoy it. Illustrations are great and you can make up words to go along with the pictures. I would by it again and recommend for others
193609648X|2.0|I purchased the book just for the necklace design. The instructions are vague, and there is no demo photo of several important steps, and no customer service info. I wish there was a number I could call with questions.<br />After trying to work on the necklace three times, I found that the instruction was wrong -- there should be 68 beads, not 63 as indicated in the book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is not one of those fake reviews, this is ALL real! I have Pintrest on my kindle fire. (Gracie Johnson follow me!) It is very easy to upload photos  from your gallery. Although Kindle Fires don't take photos you can always send your photos to your e-mail and download it.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Such a new and refreshing sound.  I think this sound will bring many back to classical music as it bridges the old with the new.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Overall, I liked it quite a bit.  The story made the underlying concepts a little less &#34;dry&#34;.  I identified a lot of the problems the fictional IT department had with my own real life experiences.
B00ABMZRVO|1.0|This movie was the dullest movie I've seen in quite sometime.  The acting and writing were stilted.  I would not recommend this film even if there was nothing else to view.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Didn't think it was much at first, but it I  really fun and addictive! Love the originality. Could  play all day. Great to  kill time or  mental escape
B00865P3AS|5.0|More of the wonderful sound these young guys have when they perform.  What a great way to start your day!
B00881VLCE|3.0|fun at first but hard to move pieces.  very frustrating.  way too many ads that can't be avoided.  popup ads every few seconds. paid 3.99 to remove ads.  supposed to be good on all my devices but only shows up on the kindle I used to purchase the ad removal.  really a pain in the butt to use.
B009AMANBA|5.0|We saw this move at the theater and really enjoyed it so much that we wanted to have it on DVD.<br />Excellent stars in it.  Great for history.
0300108834|5.0|This is such a wonderful book, not just for children, but for adults who have forgotten (or never learned) about so much of mankind's history. If you have studied this book on Amazon's website and its reviews, you will see that I wrote an earlier review that praised A Little History of the World. This review today is merely an update, a confirmation that I bought yet another copy of the book and am rereading it before sending it off to my American Godson in California.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I have a very short list of books that I would say are near-perfect in their greatness.  Stephen King's IT comes to mind, as well as Dune by Frank Herbert and A Canticle for Liebowitz by Walter M. Miller.  I Am Legend by Richard Matheson is so brilliant that it is hard to put into words.  At roughly 170 pages or so, it is not a long story but the action that takes place in that 170 pages is intense and so compelling that you want to read this book in one sitting.  I beg you please do NOT shy away from reading this book because of the awful Will Smith movie.  That movie bears little to no resemblance to the story contained within this brilliant book.  I read it in one night (with the lights on) and it made me realize what great storytelling can be when it is done right. This book will haunt you, will scare you, but most of all will leave you with a feeling that you wish it didn't have to end.
0300169787|5.0|Gave the books as gift with rave reviews and appreciation of it.  Very well done and what can one say about the very best in Fashion!!  the cover was Amazing and very clever..
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|This is a fast moving narrative of an IT Manager's actions to organize the IT function of his company in an integrated fashion.  It involves the varied personalities of the different department managers, and introduces efficient and effective means for development, testing, and moving software packages into production.<br /><br />The subject matter is rather technical in nature, but will appeal to anyone who has, or is about to be, involved in the development and application of company-wide computer integrated manufacturing processes.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I thought this CD would be fun and be upbeat like Justin's songs usually are. This CD has a very R&B sound. I could barely listen to the entire CD in one sitting. I'm sorry but it's just not what I expected from Justin. I'm very disappointed.
159514188X|4.0|This book. . .ahhhhh. It was amazing. I literally read it in half a day, blazing through it in everyone of my classes, which probably wasn't a good idea but hell it was worth it. Jay Asher is amazing.<br /><br />I loved every single second of 13Reasons, mainly because there was a time i my own life where suicide took up almost every one of my thoughts. Each time something bad happened to me, like Hannah, I would think of suicide. I often wondered why I still roamed the halls of my high school when I wouldn't even be missed if I was gone, anyway. While reading the book I couldn't help but relate to Hannah in every way. We were so similar, it was scary. And that's why it really angered me when I read some of the negative reviews saying things like, Hannah's a whiny, immature little brat. Or, Hannah is just trying to blame everyone else for a death that was her own decision. Oh, and this is the best one: Hannah just wants attention.<br /><br />The only thing I have to say to that is: ignorant. If you honestly think that's what suicide is about--blaming other people, telling people to screw off with a last \\"F You\\" in the form of your own death, or even trying to gain attention through suicide--then you're SO IGNORANT. It is NOT not about blaming other people. It's just not. And I'm not going to explain suicide in detail to those ignorant enough to blame the victim, but yeah. You're wrong.<br /><br />Sometimes the reason for a suicide is such a hard thing to pinpoint, and I love that Jay Asher brought all these people together into Hannah's final story. They think that they're only doing insignificant things, things that aren't really that big of a deal, but she makes them realize that in the end their actions have become a lot bigger. Those deeds committed in innocence help contribute to a bigger picture.<br /><br />I loved this book from cover to cover, and I can't think of a single negative thing to say about it. All parents should read it. I'm a freshman in college right now, and as soon as I read it I sent it home to my mom for her to read and gain some insight. It's such an amazing, classical book. I just wish more people got the point of it, and saw that what Hannah went through is not so different from what your neighbor or a friend or a relative might be going through. I hope it makes more people look a little harder for the signs.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Had forgotten how much I enjoyed this show. I could not remember where I knew Fillon from! I am such a flake. My son was surprised when I mentioned I had ordered it. Now I will have to hide it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great! Fantastic! Everything a book should be! I'm so happy that I read all these books. I'm sad to see it end
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I tried to download this game and was told it was corupted and I could not load it.  I got charged for it anyway.  Do I need to say more?
B007REV4T8|3.0|Daniel Craig is probably a good actor but to me he leaves me feeling that he is no Double O07. After Sean Connery and Roger Moore he is really lacking.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|I'm an avid film watcher. I am the proud owner of all 100 films on the AFI 100 greatest American films of all time. But, hands down, this one is my favorite. And to finally have it released on Blu-Ray: I'm doing a happy dance right now. The digital transfer is gorgeous. And Peter O'Toole is a wonder to behold. One of the great film performances in movie history.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|I LOVED Josh's first cds. Closer and Awake were great. And Noel is the only Christmas cd that I listen to over and over again during the month of December. But things went downhill in my opinion with Illuminations. The songs weren't catchy to me and I just didn't want to listen to it much! There was maybe one good song and the rest I just didn't really enjoy. I still enjoy his music and he has an amazing voice, but I do wish I hadn't purchased this cd.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Once you start, you won't want to stop.<br />Levels start easy to get your feet wet, yet you can skip ahead to more challenging levels.
B005LAIIJY|3.0|Actually am a little disappointed in this movie. After all the hype I would classify this as a B Movie. The actors were OK but some of the action was a little unbelievable. Also I don't believe that most slaves from that period understood English except for simple commands. Other than that the movies is ok.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a great love story! Nicholas Sparks always does a fantastic job writing novels that get you hooked from the beginning!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I've always been a fan of The Sound of Music ever since I was young. Hearing the songs takes me back to my childhood! This box set is so wonderful! It includes so many &#34;extras&#34; that other box sets don't usually include. There's a music box! I don't know that I'll use it much, but a nice extra! I love the hard cover and soft cover books that tell the &#34;real&#34; story of the Von Trapp family! So interesting and great to know that the movie actually follows a true story! For the price, I would highly recommend it! If you're planning on buying the movie, do yourself a favor and just buy this set!
B00ACKU1NY|5.0|My husband was born in the south of France and lived there until he was 14 years old and then came to the US. So us being able to see the news there is great. Thanks for making an app for France
B005WMQ5R8|4.0|The animation is awesome, the story is very simple and somewhat nonsensical. The animation makes it worth watching though and blu-ray is very nice.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|This is a very moving story of courage & inner strength in the midst of trial.  This is a beautifully photographed movie.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|bought this item for my grandsons, they liked it and had a good time waching it, need the second part thoug.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|it is really an amazing album; buy it. get over their past and listen to it. it won't fail you...
B000QCS8TW|4.0|unfortunately i watched the first series before i started the book. the first series was fantastic but i think im a little bored with the book because ive already watched it. so far the book is very close to the show so there hasnt been much new. i cant wait to start the second book. i'll wait to watch the show until after ive finished the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing the last three chapters had me drooling can't wait to read book three HUNGER GAMES FOR THE WIN BABY
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I love this book because it is very practical, something like you can honestly tell your own sister without hiding or wrapping anything.<br /><br />I am from Korea, considered as one of the developed countries, but we are at the bottom when we see gender equality index from some research. This is true and also not true, but one thing is very clear, perusing life which we (women) want in Korea is rather challenging, and most of us, choose to compromise with whatever circumstance drive us out from keep us where we want to be.<br />I wrote a review with very Korean view, so if any of the Korean lady stumble upon this review, you can see more in Korean language here.<br /><br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show but unfortunately Amazon will make me pay for the last season and all HD movies even though I have Prime.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Although at times it become another TV &#34;procedural&#34;, it has somehow managed to maintain interest and make three dimensional portraits of its characters. And it owes very much to the extraordinary talent of Juliana Margulies. Compared to most of the rest of TV drama,it rates about seven stars.
0691152640|3.0|The authors of this book, Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, two nationally recognized U.S. economists, conducted an economic study of international governments/sovereign nations.  Their primary area of focus was the variety of financial crises suffered by sovereign nations, and included defaults on the national debts.  The historical period they studied was the past 800 years. After concluding the study, they published the results of their research in both 1) \\"This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly\\" (published January 1st, 2009) and 2) a report entitled \\"Growth in a Time of Debt (published in January 2010) which, in essence, concluded that any country whose sovereign debt load is equivalent to 90% or greater of its GDP will have an increase in unemployment that will be accompanied by a significant downturn in economic growth.<br /><br />The publication of the findings contained in this book have since caused quite a stir (uproar?) in the numerous countries which find themselves in the position of carrying that very same debt load to GDP ratio.  Much political hay has been made by politicians in many countries regarding the necessity of paying heed to the authors' findings.  And why not?  After all, the authors ARE highly respected experts in their chosen field of expertise.  In our own country (mine at least - the U.S.A.) politicians from both political parties have espoused the need to adhere to the principles touted by them.  Unfortunately (and inexplicably to my way of thinking), the tremendous brouhaha aroused in all these nations on something as important as changing their entire way of thinking about national economics has been based on just ONE study!  Doing so is, at best, injudicious, unwise, imprudent, ill-advised, brash, and lacking sound judgement, which is just a nicer way of saying \\"It's just plain stupid.\\"  And, at worst, it's a recipe for disaster of - quite literally - global proportions.  Think I'm exaggerating?  Just for a moment consider the egregiously harmful effects that could follow in the wake of world wide acceptance of medical treatment based on a single study conducted by just two researchers in the field of medicine, regardless of how impeccable their reputations, and how highly respected and revered by their peers.<br /><br />(Now it's time for a just a small bit of a disclaimer.) I am NOT an \\"expert\\" in the field of economics, medicine, or science.  As such I cannot definitively state that all, or even part, of the basic tenets of the \\"scientific method\\" of research (defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as: \\"a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses\\") are applicable to the study of economics.  However, it would seem to be just common sense that at least two of the tenets should apply in some form and to some degree.  Those tenets are 1) \\"Replication\\" and 2) \\"External/Peer Review.\\"  (As much as I normally revile assumption I will, in this instance, consider that anyone capable of reading and comprehending the information contained in the book under discussion, here, is familiar with these terms.)  Unfortunately, not even one of these tenets were observed/performed from the time the book was published, until April 15th, 2013 - a period of over four years - something almost completely unimaginable in almost any other field of professional study.<br /><br />However, April 15th, 2013, Thomas Herndon, 28 year old college grad student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, whom was given an assignment to re-run someone (any someone) else's research data and see if he could get the same results/findings.  He chose the above book/report feeling that something just wasn't right about the findings.  He tried replicating the results by using Reinhart's & Rogoff's data sets, but failed to do so after numerous attempts.  He eventually asked his girl friend if she would provide a fresh pair of eyes (she is also a researcher), and while looking at a Microsoft Office \\"Excel\\" spreadsheet the author's had provided to Mr. Herndon, she quickly pointed out that a crucial column in their data - the one that averages the growth rates of countries' debt to GDP ratios of 90% - was wrong.  The average should have contained data from rows 30 to 49, but instead they only averaged from rows 30 to 44 - five missing rows.  All this was apparently due to a typographical error.  If you correct the spreadsheet error, and replace the omitted countries back into the data set, the entire statistic falls apart.  Instead of countries that were burdened with the dangerous level of 90% debt to GDP having a negative growth rate of .1% - as stated in the book - they actually have a modestly positive growth rate of 2.2 %.  That is a HUGE difference - the difference between recession and recovery.  This means the intellectual cornerstone of the argument for austerity measures was based - in part - on a mistake in a Microsoft Office \\"Excel\\" spreadsheet from two of the most widely lauded economists in the world.<br /><br />In conclusion: while it has yet to be proven that any country has suffered further economic woes as a result of applying the authors' somewhat tainted findings, I would hope that this is a loud and clear wake-up call to governments, politicians, leaders, and professionals everywhere.  The lesson should be verify EVERYTHING.  Double and triple check ALL data for typographical errors; conduct attempts at Replication; conduct External/Peer Reviews and, maybe most importantly never forget that regardless of someone's level of brilliance NO ONE is perfect.<br /><br />As for my Rating: even though vast majority of the research and data in the book were not rendered invalid by this error, it still looms large.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|My grandchildren and I all love it. It is easy for any age group. It is fun for competition and we challenge each other .
B00881PTRC|1.0|I was excited to see a modern spin on a game i used to play for hours when i was young.<br /><br />game started fine, selected my catagory and started the game. My first pick of a letter was wrong and the animation came up for the hangman, but where should be a nice cute graphic popped up a black box, with thr animation being drawn, but everything but the animation was now black and couldnt see anything. definite flaw.<br /><br />I have restarted the app a few times with the same result.<br /><br />I am using a Motorola Razr Maxx
B00B2064IY|5.0|I am 51 years old and a lifelong Hendrix fan. Jimi had a huge influence on me and I learned to play guitar at 15 and have been playing ever since. This album brings back what I liked about Jimi and gives the audience a fresh selection of tracks to enjoy. The only glitch I find on this album is that Hey Gypsy Boy ends abruptly without a fadeout. The original recording of that song was on the Midnight Lightning album and I compared the two, the latter being more complete. The recordings on this album are very good and excellently mastered. Overall I give this album 5 stars and higly recommend adding it to your collection.
0375413405|4.0|Bought this for my hubby.  Nice book.  Unfortunately we don't use it that much.  It nice to know we have it if we need a good french recipe.  Would recommend to all if you like that style of cooking.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|I had heard that Fight Club was an awesome movie and had a huge fan base, but I never seen it. So I ordered it and I was expecting a rock em sock em non-stop violent fighting movie, little did I know this movie was so much deeper than that. It takes you through the life of average white-collar worker(Edward Norton)who has insomnia and pretty much is troubled in life. Things change for him when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt)as they begin a strange friendship and then they end up starting Fight Club as a therapy for excess stress and anxiety, but it ends up much more and deeper than that.<br /><br />Fight Club is now in my Top 5 favorite movies of all time. It really is a great movie for anyone troubled, or just looking for a funny, bruising, life-contemplating, movie that will have you in it. And has plenty of quotes and scenes you'll remember.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|I gave this 5 stars...I'll never understand why they only did two seasons!!?  This is the best of the Stargate series in my opinion!!  I wish someone would finish it up so we could find out what happen to them!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Started off a little slow, then as the mysteries deepened and some possibilities started to come into focus, I had to keep flipping pages to see what came next. Fun, perfect read for my vacation!
B00873GRU4|3.0|An interesting concept for a possible future Earth where humans can no longer live on the planet surface.  Some of the technical issues with the concept were not dealt with well or just plain forgotten about in the plot.  Ok if you suspend judgement on the science, interesting plot and ending.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|It ended too soon. The story was simple, well written and touching. I want to know what happens next. To me, this is always the sign of a great book because it needs to go on forever.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thought Catniss and Peeta were safe in the end of the Hunger Games. Guess again. They are thrown back in the next hunger games 75th anniversary games. Read what happens next. Turn off the phones, have a snack and drink next to you. You are not going to put this book down until it is done. Then you need to read the Mocking Jay to see what happens next. I won't give it away. Must read. Enjoy.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Definitely worth .99. I love this version with 2 om-nums it's twice as much fun. Takes a little more thought to get all stars. I like watching my 4 year old figure it out.
B00BZODDYU|2.0|I wish I could tell more of this story without giving it away.  All I can say is the storyline, directing, scary parts and production ideas of this movie has been redone too many times.  Not worth the money to own.  Maybe to rent if extremely curious and bored.
B007T8BYWE|4.0|This is great if you like model planes and Japanese puzzles. This is a type of Japanese puzzle called \\"nonogram,\\" where you make a picture using just numbers. Compared to other nonograms that I've played, these are super easy. There is no undo button, either, but you do get to make a few mistakes before you lose.<br /><br />There is just one model plane in this app, but each puzzle represents a different part of a model plane, like one puzzle represents the glue. There are 15 puzzles, but there are 3 versions of each, a 5x5, 10x10, and 15x15, so there are actually 45 puzzles. You can't zoom, but the puzzles are small enough so this doesn't matter too much.
B000NY12CI|5.0|Infidel is very well written and important!<br /><br />I feel like I understand the Muslim faith better if only from Ms. Ali's point of view, which I sadly fear is the case, the oppression of women, honor killings even in Holland that Dutch authorities discovered at Ali request once she was a member of the Dutch Parliament. Every person in Western nations ought to read Ayaan Hirsi Ali's Infidel.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|A must read for all IT professionals especially those transitioning to a DEVOPS model and want to better understand what that means.  Good reading.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|The voice-over casting was great. The story might have run a little longer than I might have chosen, but all in all, it was an enjoyable movie kids should like.
B009JVSAVM|5.0|I can't believe we just now found this goofy show!  Even better to watch without commercials interruptions!  Bazinga! Highly Recommend.
B008Q08580|5.0|My husband said this movie required too much thinking,  but that's precisely why I favored it. Dark & subtle hints are much more interesting than a graphic display of violence.  This is the original dysfunctional family gone horribly wrong story. Ryan Gosling plays a believable, messed up young man--180 degrees from the romantic leading man roles of late. Make your popcorn & pay attention.
B001NLKT60|5.0|i really enjoyed this book, can't get enough. It is hard to put down. I am currently reading the third book
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|great price but the box was very damaged and the disc was waterlogged. The disc played though without any problems.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I wanted to start with the book after hearing what friends said about the movie,i.e. it was hard to know if it was real.  Interesting, about human endurance and interplay with God's creatures.  I found the writing style easy to read and entertaining..
B0089LOG02|5.0|A society's character is determined by how they treat their children and their elderly.  It's upsetting to know we have been failing in this area since the beginning of time.  The Orphan Train was a bit of history that I remember my parents vaguely discussing and I am sixty three.  The two main characters, separated by over half a century share the pain of traveling through the world without any immediate family.  For most of us that is hard to imagine.  Having a rough day?  My grandmother once told me, people watch soap operas because it minimizes their own problems.  You will feel a little guilty for complaining about the bumps in the road when you read this story.  How some people survive their own life is amazing and inspiring.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This book was recommended to me by my niece. I usually like what she recommends in spite of her rarely giving anything I recommend remote consideration. As a godfather to a 5 year old, I loved this book.
0062080237|4.0|This book captured me early and pulled me in with a slow, sneaky kind of style that felt smooth in so many ways (sorry for all the s's). The brilliant twist on the relationships with the old Gods provided for incredible build, sadly, the ending just wasn't there for me. The power and momentum that I felt as the story progressed just grew to the point that I don't know of any ending that would have been appropriate. Still, another very entertaining read from an American legend.
B002KDSBGA|5.0|It was nice to be able to see this when we thought it would be hard to find.  Thank you for having a great selection of movies.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is fun and imaginative! You get more points for using your imagination than day-to-day items (e.g., a hungry beaver vs. a chainsaw to cut down a tree), which makes each level entertaining. Good game for when you are not busy, but must have access to the internet to use (so it won't work on planes). Overall, excellent game!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is Lincoln! This was the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Everyone should see it.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|You get 11 great songs with a basic accompaniment of guitar and piano that let's you clearly hear Justin's beautiful voice and all his ooohs and aaaws and awesome high notes.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|If you liked the movie, you should like this album. Others have noted that there are some differences between the movie and the soundtrack, that's what the &#34;but&#34; is for. Still, it a great album to drive to with the windows down. :)
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I wasn't crazy about the first installmentof this trilogy and only read the others to find out what happens to Ana and Christian. I thought book one was not well written, almost like a cheap romance novel. However, book three has a story and substance along with all the sex!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I love these guys. Songs are great, Darren is wonderful!! I knew I would love it before I heard it!!!
B00006I53S|3.0|I purchased this when I was interested in getting the 24-105mm or the 24-70mm and I should have spent the extra money. The quality is decent, but I am not too impressed.
B000FC0V3E|2.0|There are passages of very fine writing, but it's a historical artifact, and has aged badly--dated on women, misogynistic and anti-Semitic.  The characters are hollow and lost, and don't elicit my sympathy.  Read Fitzgerald instead--he has aged more gracefully and is still relevant.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I appreciate the vast array of issues, some of them quite timely, that are raised in this season's episodes.  As always, the acting is flawless; I truly am transported back in time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome. You can do creative and survival that's cool. I think anyone would like this game! I could play this game all day? I'm a girl and I love it ! Get it!, if you want to
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I loved the attitude in the movie.  Great performance by all.  Can't be a Terentino flick without a Terentino cameo, though.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Love Vamp Diaries. Great Great, now I have them all. Season 4 on dvr. Just can't do without. Love Damon.
B005V20JKI|1.0|This game is a direct clone of Super Crate Box by Vlambeer. It is stolen IP and should not be supported by an ethical person. This, along with Skyfar and Ninja Fishing are stolen IP from Vlambeer.
B0067QPVD2|3.0|After watching the original movie and the remake with Kurt Russell, This movie really didn't take off and was kind of a plodding exercise in trying to make something scary.  I did like Ms Winstead's role but all others were forgettable.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|About the time one can barely read the sadness and abuse, the story changes and wonderful characters evolve.  The situations change and evoke hearty laughter.  When you are looking for a romantic love story, a sweet ending is much more.
B002ZG99TK|2.0|Unstoppable is a moderately entertaining drama that is also a seemingly endless collection of stupid choices and absurd setups that are much more acceptable in a comedy. This movie requires that you turn your brain off. Way off. I failed to turn my brain all the way off, and I generally dislike like serious dramas that progress via absurdities. Ergo, I hated this movie and am completely stunned by how well reviewed it is.<br /><br />This movie reminded me quite a bit of 1994's The Chase. In that movie, like Unstoppable, the news media are heavily woven into the fabric of the film. In The Chase, the media are used successfully and intentionally as a running joke. In Unstoppable, the media are used successfully for narration, but the attempt is so clumsy that it becomes near-comedy unintentionally. Here's an example. Another locomotive is used in an attempt to slowdown the runaway train. As soon as it appears, the media know who is driving it, have his picture, and seem to know his entire biography. You know, just how the media always knows everything perfectly in a developing situation. But it gets worse. Moments later the plan fails when the extra locomotive derails (and of course explodes immediately as Hollywood practice dictates). Seconds after that the reporters have pronounced the driver dead.<br /><br />To the point, if you can't turn your brain off for this movie, don't even try to watch it unless you're watching just to see how poorly constructed it really is. And if you do decide that you should watch it, I recommend not spending any money to do so.<br /><br />Updated 2013-08-24: After further thought, I decided this was worth two stars rather than one. I still don't think it is a very good movie, but it's way better than something like Speed 2. Although it is too much like Speed 2 in that the drama is manufactured to the point of absurdity.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|The soundtrack has been stuck in my head for days and I can watch this over and over and over again.  Then again for good measure.  I simply don't get tired of it.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|Its watchable but no more than that.  I usually will watch good movies several times but have only watched this twice and probably will give it to someone.
B00AYLTXQC|4.0|This movie was very clever and humorous. I bought it because I like Helen Hunt and wanted to see more of her. Boy, did I ever. Unfortunately, I purchased it prior to a flight from Seattle to Denver and felt overly conspicuious with the nudity (the movie, not me). I finally turned it off and watched the remainder in the privacy of my home. Good adult viewing with good actting but not for airplanes. gp
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This book earns five stars and Brandon Sanderson really saved this series, restoring it to its past glory from the first 5 books.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Good depiction of the Great President Lincoln and some of his accomplishments. I like looking at movies that show life before all of the automation and electronics that we have today. Yet, they got along in communicating just fine; it shows a lot about handwriting and how they took penmanship seriously. Today they are considering dropping it (handwriting) from many schools curricula.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I bought the first two seasons at the same time after reading plenty of people complain about not being able to get theirs to work.  So, I spent the next two weeks watching every aspect, every part of the discs to make sure they all worked.  I don't know about others, but my discs were just fine.<br /><br />Having said that, the picture was crisp and clear, even more than the HD channels that I watch the current season on.  I've often found myself lost in the myriad background detail of a shot at the expense of what may have actually been happening.<br /><br />My only complaint, and this goes to the books as well, is that there are a LOT of characters and a LOT of scenes and places and things and stories and backgrounds all happening at the same time all over the world.  It's impossible to get everything in one screening or reading or listening or watching, though the background stuff included on the discs helps a lot.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I love listening to the complete soundtrack because I feel like I have the movie playing and I don't! Its awesome to listen to in my car!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Didn't think I would enjoy this movie until I watched it at a friends house, Then I had to find it for our collection. Good job on matching up the original characters from the original Star Trek series.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Just an excellent movie. It's truly fun, with great special effects, good acting. I enjoyed the characters, scenery (stunning), plot, everything.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I got the blu-ray discs and immediately set to watching both Seasons one and two along with all the background stuff and bonus features.  There are a LOT of them.  This is definitely a disc collection you want if you're a fan of the shows.  Unlike other season collections from other shows, it doesn't just stop at a couple commentaries.  There are commentaries on nearly every episode with some having two.  There is a 'making of' documentary, there is background information often narrated by major characters in the story, and there is a lot of other stuff that fill the discs.  Oh yeah, and plenty of Easter - I mean, Dragon eggs as well.
B004I506G6|5.0|VERY COOL OLD EPISODES, I REALLY ENJOY THEM, BRINGS BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES OF MY CHILDHOOD.  WELL WORTH IT!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Enjoyed the story and I was totally involved until the end.<br />Left me hanging...I like closure.  That's all I will say without giving it away.  Revenge would have been sweet!
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Good album. Look forward to more music from this band. Blues by young artists is always unique and interesting. Real talent here
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is always a good gap filler. The game allows for manual or mechanized play. Great for those times when just sitting amqnd waiting.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I great for the new computers that does have the old serial connector. It works great for the older electronic devices. I would recommend it to anyone that works with older equipment.
B000EDWL82|5.0|I got this as a christmas gift for my sister last year. She likes it. No problems with the disc thus far
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I'm not sure if I had built up this movie because of all the awards but I wasn't nearly as impressed as I had hoped and expected to be
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I have to admit I don't know how Rick Riordan comes up with this stuff. I couldn't see how he can expand the Percy Jackson series but he did. This was an amazing book!
B007MB5OCE|1.0|I was looking forward to this book.  It reads almost like an adult fairy tale, which I like.  However, I just couldn't get into it, it wasn't interesting or varied enough for me.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great game and both husband and granddaughter love it.  Because I am not good at it, when she kits a bad shot, it is a<br />&#34;grandma&#34; shot.  Someday I will conquer this too.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have always loved Mahjong.  So glad I can have it for my kindle.  Thank you so much  to the designers.  The designers never cease to amaze me.  Their talents are fantastic.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|Great read. I saw myself throughout the book and how I've come to &#34;conquer&#34; shy and put on the &#34;show&#34; when needed. Interesting to actually read why and that many people go through this. I never was the &#34;bookworm&#34; but always the quiet. As I got older and &#34;wiser&#34; ha, I did come to notice, after someone pointed it out, that when I do speak people do actually stop and listen. So that makes me even more afraid to speak!  I wish I would have figured this all out years ago. Thanks for writing and sharing the stories, your story!
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|which isn't often for me... it glitches and takes away my lives when I log in after not playing in over 24 hrs... or it allows me to play one round then says I'm out of lives
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I thought this game would be like Bejeweled, but it is not quite like it.  The graphics are blurry and not crisp and that is even on a high def Kindle Fire.
0756666937|5.0|He is into Legos and we live near Legoland.  He doen't put it down, enjoys see all othe old legos.
B000FBJG04|5.0|I glad this was written while these great warriors were still alive to gain their perspective.  Ambrose did a good job capturing their thoughts and feelings about what they endured.  A must read for anyone who wants to understand what is was really like.
B009AMANBA|4.0|It was a good movie but it wasn't what I had expected. I had read the book by Bill O'Reilly and really expected it to be like that one.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love musicals and particularly love the music from this movie.  The movie was very true to what I have heard and the CD of the show.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I had heard all about this show but hadn't yet seen it.  I sat and watched the first 6 episodes to catch up.  I was totally engrossed in this show and will not miss it now!
098555780X|5.0|The knots are amazing and adaptable to many configurations. I can`t wait until volume 2. Thanks J.D. keep up the good work.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|A treasure to add to your collection.
B00AVTMCYW|3.0|Pretty good movie and loved the stars in it. Good teen movie. Hard to think of four more words, there.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really got into the really intense novel and I loved the story line & outcome. Surprises galore. Want to read more Wm Landay.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It was really good in fact great you should get it because it was fun to play in when you have nothing to do.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|tHIS IS A KEEPER.  i LOVE THE CLASSIC`S DURING THE HOLIDAYS AND THIS ONE WILL BE IN MY COLLECTION FOR YEARS TO COME.  GREAT SERVICE BY AMAZON IN GETTING IT TO ME.  THANK YOU AMAZON
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|Lots of good actors in this movie. I have watched it twice now. Now I have to think of more to say.
B003B02O3C|5.0|I love this story. It was a great book to read. Would recommend to anyone who likes a good book. Also has a part that made me laugh harder than any book I have read in the past 10 years although this is not a 'comedy'. It had a little of everything in it.
B009X01D9U|5.0|Awesome! I love it! I feel safe carrying it around and it`s great to have both views! I made the right choice.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|The game is a lot of fun BUT the graphics are beautiful! It was definitely worth the $1.99! So far I've enjoyed every game I've gotten from Big Fish!
B001NKI60W|5.0|This is a fun movie.  It makes you want to get up and dance and is fun to sing along with.
B000000WFZ|5.0|This music comes from another world. Morricone composed the best soundtrack and the movie is equal in quality.<br />I usually watch it every year.
B009G3T01M|5.0|My son had to have it, and so did I. Thanks for the great download! We'll rock this CD for years.
076115728X|5.0|This is a wonderful book for any age group.  Inspiring and adorable.  The flaps lift up and show what splotches and drips can become.  It's a lot of fun and very well done.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|It was a delightful escape from the usual with a twist at the end that I didn't see coming.  I am a Johnny Depp fan, and wasn't disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|An excellent show! The time period is very interesting & the fashion is great. There are always good plots for both the family & the servants.
B00BD05PEW|4.0|I was honestly expecting this to come in a bigger size, but for what it's worth this figure is very detailed and so much to look at!<br />Papo is pulling me in with their detailed dinosaurs more and more with every year :)
B001D8W7CW|4.0|The Blu-ray transfer has mixed technical reviews. I noted some apparent fading and slight reddish cast in some scenes. Film grain also shows in scenes which I would expect in a film from this era. I do wonder about the quality of print they were able to use, but I didn't see any scratches or film gate hairs. Overall there could have been more effort on restoration. Original audio is monaural. It was remixed to DTS-HD Master 5.1 and the disc has a Dolby digital stereo option. No noticeable hiss, and one must keep in mind the fidelity, frequency range and dynamic range of the original mono sound track. It limits what can be done with restoration and remix; it won't have the fidelity or range of current films. The 5.1 remix sounds fine to me on a mid-level home theater with modest surround effect through most of the dialog and more prominent in much of the music - without seeming unnatural. Overall the Blu-ray is worthwhile as it shows much finer detail than a DVD can making it an improvement (even if more could have been done beyond the basics with restoration and in post-processing the transfer).<br /><br />The film is an adaptation of Stephen King's first published novel. For those that have not read it, the novel is not narrative, it's epistolary in structure, making a narrative screenplay adaptation more work than normal. Even so, the film is remarkably faithful to the novel without major changes (unlike screen adaptations of some of his other novels). Spacek's (Carrie) and Lurie's (Carrie's mother) performances are stellar. The Academy nominations were well deserved. Albeit not the first to do so, it helped set a new standard for the horror genre which was finally evolving from the grindhouse shoestring budget exploitation B-movies of the 1950's and 1960's. It is surprising the MPAA gave it an \\"R\\" in 1976 given the nudity in the shower scene at the beginning, other sexual content and the graphic violence without forcing the director and studio to cut or modify anumber of scenes. Carrie has, and will continue to withstand the test of time. Regarding the remakes, I can only ask: \\"why?\\" in spite of knowing it's done to leverage on the original's reputation for box office receipts and studio profits. It's among a good number with remakes that don't need a remake to produce a better one!
1433531569|5.0|I already have a standard sized ESV Study Bible and love it so much that I always recommend the ESV Study Bible to people I know in need of a Bible. So, when the Christmas season came along, I thought, &#34;What better gift could I give for my sister-in-law than an ESV Study Bible?&#34; So, I got her this one and it is lovely! Though I am fine with the regular sized one, the personal size one, being smaller, is a lot easier to carry around, and an acceptable size to place on your lap to read (I've tried that with the standard size one and it was a no-go). The only downside (and I know it's necessary in order for it to be a smaller size) is that the resources are not included at the back. At least, though, they are still available online, which makes it not so bad. At any rate, I definitely recommend the ESV Study Bible, regardless of the size!
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|Movie kept dying.  Called into support.  We thought we had it going, no luck.<br />Comcast delivered for me.  My first streaming failure from Amazon.<br /><br />Even more frustration, was trying to find a spot on the website to try to get a refund.
B004SBQAN8|3.0|Fairly good acting, not a twister of a plot, slow in the middle, a good ending (sort of).  This movie should appeal to pre-teens and young teens.
1476733953|3.0|This is a good book.<br />The first part especially made me think this could be something special, then not much else happens... So sorry, this is not a great book, not for it's time. If you are looking for thrilling ideas try some SF circa 1960.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I Loved Loved Loved this installment of Kiera Cass' trilogy! Read it on kindle in one sitting... poor husband had to fix dinner, get kids in bed, make lunches... all sooo worth it! Mama was happy!!<br />This book picks up right where The Selection left off (and I highly recommend reading the Prince little background book too)...  I was impressed with where the story took us - not gonna spoil it for other readers. Was wondering how it was going to play out and how she could make it last another two books - but this one didn't dawdle.. it had plenty of heartfelt moments, shockers, gasps and aaawwwwsss that kept me glued the entire time. Worst part? Waiting for the next one. Highly recommend this book and author. Gush-fest, out!
B000F1IQN2|4.0|Spielberg's movie cannot be categorized.  It's a story of vengeance, pain, & anguish.  PTSD?  Eric Bana's character is experiencing that.  It can't be hidden.  It shouldn't be hidden.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I first read this in my teens and then 30 years later I re-read it. It is quite amazing to me that a book about rabbits who are chased from one warren, start a new warren and talk to each other can be so compelling but it works wonderfully and is beautifully written. It is appropriate reading for those who are 12 to those 112. An innocent but page grabbing read from start to finish and proves that good books can be written without the need for robots, AK47's or courtrooms. I am surprised that Pixel have not yet picked this up and made it into a box office smash.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I have read probably every Temperance Brennan book but this one felt different.  The setting is in north western Canada.  What I found tedious was the amount of background information the author thought she needed to provide for the reader to follow the plot.  Maybe I should have given it 3 stars....but I do enjoy the characters.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|She must pick Maxon....I mean PRINCE Maxon. One of the maids can get Aspen. I like how the maids are so totally awesome.

B00957T6X6|5.0|This series is amazing! The only problem is I'm losing sleep, too many late nights with this book. Can't wait for the next book in the series.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|Although Brian composed it in the late 60s, I had never heard of Smile.  In the early 2000s I went on a Beach Boys binge, listening to every LP and CD I had of them, and then the first Smile CD appeared in 2004.  Of course I had to have it.  But upon listening to it, I thought &#34;this is some bizarre stuff, not the beach or cars or the incredibly gorgeous and artistic Pet Sounds.&#34;  It did have it's moments though with Good Vibrations, Heroes and Villains, and the hauntingly beautiful Surf's Up.  I tucked it away.  Then just this year I started YouTubing the Beach Boys and came across a balls-out performance of Smile in London.  It was amazing!  I finally understood the direction in which Brians's creativity had been going, and that the lyrics were Van Dyke Parks' free verse poetry.  Coventional art had given way to modern art, so to speak.  And Brian had been vying with the Beatles to create something timely, new and fresh.  I started comparing Smile with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Magical Mystery Tour.  Duh!  It had never really dawned on me that these three albums and most of the other popular music of that era were psychedelic.  I was in high school and at UCLA at the time and was a square, not into shrooms and acid.  Maybe a little pot was OK.  Dude, Smile was ultimate stoner Americana music!  I fell in love with all its intricacies, bought the 2011 CD set, hit the vape, put on my head phones, turned out the light, and the rest is history.

B00005N6KG|4.0|These are not as sensitive as a no-name pair of ear buds I have but they don't pop out of my ears and more importantly my ears don't hurt after wearing them a short while. I use them (and the ear buds also) with a Fujiyama EO6 headphone amplifier for improved bass, more volume, and improved run time from my mp3 player (due to reduced volume levels w/ the amp in-line). These 'phones work well and are priced right! ... Mark
B00BHMEOP2|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat almost from the beginning. It was a masterpiece of directing. I highly reccomend this movie to all.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I downloaded this because my son said it would be good for ONE song.  Now, I can't stop listening to the music.  I've had it on repeat for a week now.  GREAT album.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fillion's had me since he played the mad preacher in \\"Buffy TVS\\". And he only gets better. Firefly was a masterpiece, but alas the creative shows are cut right and left so America's \\"reality\\" shows must go on. I'd much rather watch 'Teen Moms', wouldn't you?<br /><br />Serenity made me want more. Fillion and Whedon are quite a pair. Now I watch Castle and I've pretty much enjoyed it, but while the charm and sense of humor are there, it's no Whedon production.
B005LAII3U|3.0|I haven't seen the original, but I my whole reason for buying this and viewing it, was because I wanted to see a fun sci-fi movie with stuff blowing up. I got exactly that. I ended up really enjoying the film.<br /><br />The world really interested me, the special effects were spectacular, I loved the tone of the movie and how it kept changing from calmness to desperation and mysterious was great to me. The actors all did great playing their roles. Colin Farrell really impressed me as Quaid and I felt for the character. Kate Beckinsale felt pretty vicious and evil and Jessica Biel did great as a symphaetic character. The plot, although nothing special, really interested me and I felt the twists, although random, were appropreite.<br /><br />Now on the flip side, dispite enjoying the movie there are some problems with it. One is character development is weak one example being Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel's relationship. There isn't much to it, it's just there. While I do feel sympatheic towards Biel sometimes her emotions feel bland, but I'm not totally complaining as I was still engaged to what was happening. The final fight is another one of those fights where it feels like the producers wanted to include one more just for kicks. Finally the twists are random and kind of confusing as to who was fooled and what was the purpose of Quaid in the first place.<br /><br />So while I did enjoy it, the movie remains what I expected it to be... A sci-fi flick with lots blowing up and some one liners.
B00AIJP9BS|4.0|I thank you all will have a lot of fun with it.Jim ,I have hade a good time with the game..

B00BTYP6QE|5.0|If you think feeding candies by solving crafty puzzles to One Om Nom from [[ASIN:B0058VW36U Cut the Rope]] or [[ASIN:B007KQ6XYY Cut the Rope: Experiments]] was not enough then [[ASIN:B00BTYP6QE Cut the Rope: Time Travel HD]] will definitely satisfy your cravings to solve even more puzzles as you travel back in time. Dual Om Noms on the screen each one begging you to feed them is simply adorable.<br /><br />The puzzles got even more entertaining and so are the sounds these two lovely cute Om Noms make. These series of games from developers ZeptoLab are *must* have for anyone craving for some cuteness fun filled game on their tablets and cell phones. There is no better way to waste time :-) The games are fit for anyone in the family and this Time Travel is no exception<br /><br />Full five adorable stars for Om Noms - Highly recommended for everyone!
B008CLI3TE|5.0|HBO has done it again. After viewing Band of Brothers and The Pacifc (which I enjoyed less), I was hopeing this would live up to all the hype it was getting but I was unsure as while I had been told a good amount of the plot, I was unsure about how it could interest me. Once the first episode was over I knew that question mark was no longer an issue. The structure of the show, although slightly confusing at first, proved to be quite ingenious, giving multiple story arcs and all kinds of different themes.<br /><br />The leader of a family, trying to make sense of important royalty being killed, one families plot to overthrow the monarchy, one man's quest to seek revenge towards the land that exiled him, a woman's journey towards respect of her new culture, one young man trying to find his place being viewed as an outcast, views about religion, trust, power and much more. This show is loaded with awesomeness.<br /><br />Like with Lost, the new Battlestar Galactica series and Heroes, the shows contunity is very detailed and if you miss one episode you will be lost. The characters although it will be hard to recall names, all provide very interesting stories, although some stories/characters are ment to be hated. Yet part of the show is to show human nature and very different personalities interacting with each other. I honestly cannot think of anything to complain except it is hard to remember names, thankfully faces are not.<br /><br />If you haven't picked this up or viewed, make sure you do.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Starting this book, I really liked it. I wish I could give this book 4 stars but the second half of the novel just did not sustain my interest. The connection Victoria has with flowers inspires her early relationships with people, which was a fascinating and rewarding look into her past and emotions. For me, the plot became too melodramatic in the second half and the decisions Victoria makes do not seemingly fit with this growing person we met at the beginning. I do appreciate the topics Diffenbaugh is bringing to the reader's attention: issues with foster care, adoption, the impact these institutions have on children, etc., but there wasn't enough explanation for me to fully understand its impact on the characters. I liked reading this book and it was a very quick read, but it left me dissatisfied so I give this novel 3 stars.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|This book is awesome. It kept me holding on until the last page. I can't wait to red the next book Reached. :)
B0042C1BP0|5.0|Great movie Daniel Craig is almost a good of James Bond as Shawn Connery, I'm glad to add it to my collection
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I was a bit trepidatious about this movie, but I enjoyed it thoroughly!  Great plot, awesome soundtrack, amazing cast, all around it was super-entertaining! I'd recommend it to my friends, for sure.

B0012QK8G2|5.0|Thin Lizzy is a great band that sadly lost one of the best guitarists/singers of the 1970's Phil Lynott.  This album is an essential look at the band at it's peak, firing on all cylinders.  The songs on this live album surpasses the studio versions of the songs by a mile.

B003PTP4S6|4.0|An excellent mixture of musicians.<br />A good CD for my private music collection. There is not waste in its content
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldn't stop reading first book through third book. Hope there will be more books in the near future.  They were great.
B00136JS12|4.0|I have loved this album since it's debut in 1976 and it still sounds as good today as back then. Much of the success was due to the intelligent songwriting of Tom Scholz and rock vocals of Brad Delp, who by the time of their third album Third Stage, were the only two from the original lineup left.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|This was a gift for my son & he loves it. In fact he has added to his own collection on his own acct. Thank you so much.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is so easy to read and it keeps you wanting more. It's hard to put down and is a real page turner. I love how it leaves you hanging on at the end. Time to read the last book.:)
B008NMT684|5.0|I'm 20 years old and I still love putting these fun puzzles together!!!!! I love the part when yo get to pop the balloons. I once had a balloon, it also popped.  That brings me back to the old ages.
B00006WKY9|5.0|This was a sad end of Scorps career in that it was their last outing with guitar wizard Ulrich Roth.  This is the Scorpions at their artistic and experimental peak, never again would they delve into this kind of musical power displayed here.  After this we were stuck with a bunch of commercial nonsense, Bad Boys Running Wild my ass.
B00637D114|4.0|It was better than expected,  not as annoying as  the original series.  The kids enjoyed it very much  and I was even sucked into watching  posts of it!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series is worth actually buying the DVD! It is a great show.  It does include the Xmas special.<br />Will purchse Season 4 too.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a very good game. It is teaching me responsibility. It is also keeping my baby sister occupied. Great game &lt;3. I hope there are more games to come.
030758836X|2.0|This book came highly recommended and being so popular, I couldn't wait to read it. I very much enjoyed the first few chapters and suggested the book to friends. From then on, it became an ever more disturbing tale. The characters are unlikeable and dangerous. The ending was unbelievable and left me flat. I am sorry I recommended the book.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I know some people have reviewed this book saying it is \\"too dark\\", but I really enjoyed it. It is a bit twisted, but I thought it was a great read, that kept me guessing.
B0076DELIG|5.0|All harry Bosch Novels are great reading. Michael Connelly is the best at these kind of novels and this series I hope he keeps writing about Harry
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi high Highbury hobby but I know that there is always Highbury hobby of the world is an independent worker in the world of opera and the other band
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey is my favorite violin artist. I love this album...I've been playing it again and again in my car whenever I'm driving.<br /><br />Also, I went to one of her tours last month and had a blast! I'd definitely recommend her to anyone who has a heart for inspiring music.
0399157565|1.0|Had been a fan for years, but this one just sucked. Reread the ending three times and still wonder who this guy was in the novel. Just bad book with the same characters. Good by Pat afraid you struck out again, but for me, last time
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy solitaire and this one gives you plenty to do. Take it everywhere, great to take for Doctor visits also, passes the time quickly.
0345803507|5.0|I wanted the full series because it is a good book and it is a series that I will read over and over.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Critics complain there is to much marching.  They walked to the battle to fight and die. It was worth it!
B004H2ZFPW|5.0|Much better than her third album this one is as good as the first. This is one talented young lady, she can sing,write, play instruments, a real standout in todays music scene
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Couldn't understand it and it was one bad show . Not worth your time or effert to watch. Not even worth one star.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|love guys like johnny winter that just get better with age. Boz has in the past two decades  made some great soul/blues...his voice is really suited the material he chooses..bought this at  starbucks but the amazon price is better..now!  if he would just get together with robben ford  and make something really monumental..west coast giants!
B001NLL93W|4.0|Really liked the ending to this series. Could have done without the brother/sister storyline, was just too weird and strong ickiness factor. But love the Shadowhhunter world enough I stuck with the series. Looking forward to the &#34;prequal&#34; clockwork series.
B005EWDA3I|5.0|I like Murakami's books. His writing is very descriptive and also shows enourmous imagination and depth.<br />The last book - IQ84 (all three parts) took me away from my everyday life for nearly two weeks (I was too busy<br />to read it in one go). It was a real pleasure and I am looking forward to read his next book that, I hope, he will write!
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|heard him on TV show and liked his voice  good listening time.  i enjoy love and heart songs to listen to as I travel
B0031RSBS2|3.0|...but it is not Reacher at his best. Highly implausible plot, with a Reacher more arrogant than usual. It is as though he knows he has already been the hero of 11 other books and is beginning to believe his own press. I find Child's writing style to be quite compelling, and can rarely put a book down once I have started it. This one was no different, I just found the story to be more convoluted than the other books I have read. Three stars only, I'm afraid, Lee.
B00005MJ06|5.0|LOVE THESE GREAT SONGS!  Makes You Want to Dance and sing!  Brings back memories!  You'll want to play this CD over and over!
0920668364|5.0|Each of my kids have a copy of this as do I.  We can all say the verses by heart.  This one was given to my first grandchild...perfect gift!!!
B005IEGUDY|1.0|Disjointed. Not a smooth transition from one era to the next. Weak sentence construction is weak a waste of paper characters have little personality.
B008602KQI|3.0|The books were all fantastic, but the movie was definitely lack luster...It expected you to have read the books, which one cannot assume.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Really love this album.  Very old school but, fresh enough to feel new!  JT is a fav of mine, always has been.<br />I have to say, the album cover really caught my eye!  (HA)  I work with this type of equipment every day so I really dug the cover and title.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|I loved the twists and turns of this work of fiction, as well as trying to understand the agony of the lead female character.  The last chapters reallyblew me away - the author has done a great job of keeping you hanging on by your fingernails till the very last minute
B008HK3XU4|5.0|A previous case we'd purchased did not reliably old the Kindle Fire HD.  This case has a sturdy plastic bracket which retains the Fire nicely whether in the portrait or landscape layout.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Great flick, great series. Love them all! Would definitely recommend all four book and all five movies to anyone inquiring!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is great it's really addictive and loads of fun trying to do all room collections.... I'm hooked if you love bingo you will love this game
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Love it.  Only thing is the stickers.  Not much fun with a 3 year old you have to tell to wait while you put stickers on.
B005S9ELVC|2.0|For a movie that had a high-voltage theme (the mob), this sure did turn out to be a whole lot of nothing.  Doomed by an absolutely pitiful script, as well as miscasting all around, \\"The Gangster Squad\\" is more fluff than substance.  Oh sure, the costumes make for a nice period piece, but that's about it.  You've got Sean Penn (who I really like) literally chewing scenery, while Ryan \\"I-Can't-Act-My-Way-Out-of-a-Paper-Bag\\" Gossling completely miscast as some kind of \\"tough-guy cop.\\"  He was not believable for one second, nor was his forced love affair with what's-her-name.  Josh Brolin underplayed his role, but it was so cliched (as were most in the film) that all they turned into were caricatures.  And BOOOORING, lord love a duck, I found my hand on the fast forward button too many times.  All that's worth your time is the last five minutes, but getting there will take the patience of Job.<br /><br />Rated \\"R\\" for violence and language, \\"The Gangster Squad\\" needs to face a firing squad.  P. U.
0060245867|5.0|I have always loved this book and got it for a friend's baby shower. it was in great condition and brought back a lot of good memories
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This was a great movie for the whole family!  Just heard that they are working on Pitch Perfect 2, Can't wait!
B008XG1X18|5.0|found the app easy to manage &amp; I can pin from sites using the kindle fire. Its pretty much the same as the regular site.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Quick and fantastic read! I don't even need the extra 16 words this review says I required, just read the book.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This movie was really interesting.  Didn't really  like the idea of children killing each other but had to see it due to the kids at school always talking about it.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|A friend recommended this program to me and I've put it on all my devices.  I set it to play at work on my Kindle Fire HD and turned the screen off.  The music was relaxing and helped me stay focused.  However, it drained the battery in 3 hours.  I have the same results on my iPad and my Android phone.  Why?  I can listen to an audio book from Audible all day and the battery lasts all day.  Please fix this issue and it's why I can't give it 5 stairs.  Oh, if you get a headache while listening to it turn off the brain 5MHZ setting.  Several people have told me this.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love puzzle games that aren't too easy, and I was told by a friend that this would be a perfect game for me! It was short, I used no hints and it only took a few hours, but it was definitely worth the two dollars I paid. I most definitely recommend this for anyone who likes to think hard and have fun at the same time. Ok absolutely cannot wait for the next room!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very intense from beginning to end. Not sure I liked the ending. Will say that it is not a Hollywood ending, which is refreshing.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have avast! installed on my laptop and recently upgraded it.<br />Have used the free version for several years and so far it<br />has protected me from viruses...so I installed it on my tablet.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I loved this book!  I was happy that the main character turned out to be such strong woman with all the adversity she faced.
B002VECM6S|5.0|... despite having connections with Ole Miss (I graduated from Univ of Memphis). Great movie. Great story. Great casting. Got it for a great price too. What's not to love?
B000PAAH3K|4.0|This book is very informative. One of the things I really like about Malcolm Gladwell is the painstaking amount of research that goes into his books; you can definitely tell from reading it, as he includes tons of studies and a lot of anecdotal evidence....This book is interesting though, because it sheds a lot of light on what he calls &#34;thin-slicing&#34; or making snap judgements of people, situations, etc...I definitely recommend it.
0385535147|5.0|I didn't even know what \\"Racketeering\\" was...if you are wondering the same let me enlighten you: criminal activity that is performed to benefit an organization such as a crime syndicate. Examples of racketeering activity include extortion, money laundering, loan sharking, obstruction of justice and bribery. So there you have it, our main character Malcolm Bannister is entangled in a racketeering case. He became involved unwillingly when as a lawyer himself assisted in some property transactions for a client. When he becomes wrongly imprisoned he attempts to broker a deal for his early release.<br /><br />I can't really go into much more of the story without giving it all away, but I will say that the adventure that ensues will keep you reading until the end. The twists and the turns, you never really know how it is going to end until it ends.<br /><br />I have to get my hands on more Grisham novels, and I have to do it now. If only I knew which ones to choose. I heard THE BRETHREN is really good, as is BLEACHERS which is sitting there on my  book shelf feeling very unloved. But THE RACKETEER has me hooked.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I don't know about fees and I have been playing for a good time.  The game is fun and gets progressively harder. Makes you use your head. I introduced this to my 6yr old nephew and he lit into it. He really enjoyed it. When he got stuck, I told him to go to his dad who is not a gamer. I knew dad would like this, bc he is an educator, and he had fun working with it, as well.  A good logic game for adults and kids.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone.  So cute and sets an example that everyone is important in any role that they set to do.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I could watch this series over & over & find something new every single time.  Each episode is like a mini-feature film!  So disappointed it was cancelled, but super happy it's out on blu-ray!!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Best Disney movie ever!  Nice to have both Blu-Ray and DVD in one package.  This was a gift for my new grandson, and I'm sure he's going to enjoy it for many years to come!
B003L77GRO|4.0|Season Five of Dexter was another great season of Dexter but the storylines seem to be more towards other people around Dexter then instead of Dexter as the main character.  I shall give a few examples Quinn sees Dexter torn up about the death of his wife and decides to look into Dexter's life outside of work with help of a fellow cop.  Dexter tries to break news to the kids about Rita's death and astor blows up at him.  They end up having two storylines threwout the whole season The Saint Death Muders with heads cup off, eyes cut out and tongue missing from heads.  Then the storyline featuring character Jordan Chase and all the dead girls in barrel's.  When Dexter kills a person finds a woman named Lumen who has been hurt by many people inculding Jordan Chase, so Dexter choices to help her with her problem to feel better about Rita's death.  Harrison Dexter's son starts to talk as he is with the nanny.  Dexter finds Astor and a gf drinking in the house, Lumen and Dexter start killing off Jordan's friends as trying to work up to killing Jordan.  But it's hard for Dexter and Lumen because of Quinn's cop friend following Dexter everywhere he goes.  Debra warns Jordan his friends are disappearing and he might be next on the person's list, Dexter takes care of Quinn's cop friend and then goes after Lumen and Jordan.  Dexter I do believe only killed two people this season, while leaving Lumen to kill a few also like a team working together to solve their problems.  But if you want to see still a good season of Dexter buy this and see for yourself still a killer season pardon the pun.  But also adding we see that their is some humanity inside Dexter by the fact he help this woman out when she needed someone to help her.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is awesome cool features nd you go through whole bunch of cool city's nd I'm a adictedc to subway augers this fun nd I love it !
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Fell in love with Joss Whedon's &#34;Firefly&#34; series and was so disappointed when it was cancelled.  If you never saw the series, you can still watch &#34;Serenity&#34; & not be lost.  Special features are great too!
