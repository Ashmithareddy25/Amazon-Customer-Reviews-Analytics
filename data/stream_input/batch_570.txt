B0000VAFO0|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie, it is so awesome and I love how the first and second work off each so well. Watch this movie!!!! It's worth it.
B000BNI90O|5.0|Previous reviewers do justice to this wonderful and fulfilling soundtrack and to them I give thanks.I for one am looking forward to future releases just as much as I did to the movies themselves.
B00004ZELJ|5.0|I've been a fan of Pop music for ever but I came to this country too late while the whole pop music was fading away already. I'm a fan of the BSB but couldn't find any place that sales this DVD. I finally got a job 2 months ago and opened a bank account and this is the first online item I've bought and I'm really please with it.<br /><br />Watching this concert, I just wish that somehow, in the next 5 years, people would like pop music again. It was such a stupid decision for Backstreet Boys and N'Sync to break up when they were on the top. Look at how BSB's doing now, it's really sad. I've bought both the newst CD and DVD of theirs and the music is still awesome. It's still pop even though they tried to be accepted again by saying they do rock now.<br /><br />Anyway, everybody who likes Pop should own this DVD.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|The movie was not what was expected, I was seeking more stories from the Grimm Fairy Tales
B000AQBA1W|5.0|I'm not one to write reviews but after buying this album I was left with no choice but to spread the word. NO! It's not a gospel or religous album. It's just that their voices are so majestic and soothing. <br />If you are a fan of The Corrs, the first observation is that there is no sound of western pop here. They went straight back to their Irish roots for this one. The songs are smooth and relaxing. <br />This is what singing is all about. The talent is apparent and obvious. <br />You can't be dissapointed with this album.

B0000062FL|5.0|Following their debut album self titled \\"Santana\\" came \\"Abraxas\\" and boy did this album ever put the stamp of CLASSIC on this group. Carlos Santana was reaching his peak with this set of songs including 'Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen', 'Oye Como Va' and 'Hope You're Feeling Better'. This 1970 release still has stood the test of time and has helped put Carlos in the company of Hendrix, Page, Clapton, Beck and Stevie Ray Vaughan as one of the best rock guitarists of all time.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|ROCKY is one of the best films of 70s, with Sylvester Stallone unquestionably in his best role and best picture of his carrier. \\"Rocky\\" won 3 Academy Awards in 1976(Best picture, Best direction, Best film editing) and was nominated for other 7 oscars. <br />Stallone plays Rocky Balboa, a poor and insignificant Italian-American box-fighter from Philadelphia who doesn't seem able to achieve something great. He struggles to make a living as both a small-time boxer, and the brawn of a local loan shark, while having a love affair with his friend Paulie's (Burt Young) shy sister, Adrian (Talia Shire) His life's opportunity will come one day when the heavyweight champion of the World, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), chooses Rocky to be his opponent for the title. For Creed the fight against an easy challenger is an exhibition, a great show and a chance for huge incomes. Creed is attracted by Rocky's assumed name, \\"Italian Stallion\\" for advertising reasons. For Rocky is the most important fight for his life. After he gets his one-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Rocky is training very hard, with his trainer, Mickey's help (Burgess Meredith, who knows that Rocky has the heart and talent to become a good fighter) to face the undefeated champion. When the fight begins, Rocky's strength and courage surprises the audience.   <br />It's a movie that represents an entire nation. The central subject of this picture is the American dream. Rocky himself it's a symbol. In America everybody are given a chance to succeed in their life. Only prerequisites are strong will and hard work.   <br /> \\"Rocky\\" was perhaps the perfect role for Stallone and I don't believe that any other could play it better than he did. Carl Weathers stars as Apollo Creed. The boxing choreographies are so realistic, that you believe you're watching a true fight. Great performances too from Burt Young and Talia Shire.  <br />Bill Conti perhaps conducted one of the most memorable scores. Especially the theme from ROCKY entitled      GONNA FLY NOW is one of the best-loved ever and deserved the Academy Award for the music score. <br />ROCKY was truly a hit , (1.100.000 $ budget in  1976  with 225.000.000$ revenues in world box-office) and became one of the most popular movies ever.  <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|Never thought I would say that about a grunge band but in this case I had to make an exception. \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit' is only the beginning of this cd. What is to follow makes this album a classic for the ages.
B000E1155E|5.0|This is a great cd by a very promising band. not the 4th best british album of all time but its definitly great.  <br /> <br />The view from the afternoon (8/10): nothing special but a fun song to start off the album. <br /> <br />I bet you look good on the dancefloor (10/10): the reason why most will buy this cd. A huge hit im britina and possibly america soon. It's been stuck in my head for about 2 weeks. <br /> <br />Fake tales of San Francisco (10/10): Sort of funky, fun lyrics. <br /> <br />Dancing Shoes(10/10): a song that sticks out. sounds like a hit, feels like a hit. a song franz ferdindand can only dream of, <br /> <br />You probebly couldnt see the lights....(9/10): good song but gets sort of annoying after awhile. <br /> <br />Still Take you Home(10/10): Great song this is one of the most fun songs on the cd. 2nd single? <br /> <br />Riot Van (9 1-2/10): Great song but way to short. an easy 10 if they lengthened it. One of the slow songs but still good. Great Lyrics. <br /> <br />Red Light indicates doors are secure(10/10): It sounds like the clash. But it stilll has its own spin. <br /> <br />Mardy Bum(10/10):one of the best songs on the Cd. very peaceful. THis hints an oasis move to a softer  album (definatly maybe to whats the story). <br /> <br />Perhaps vampire is a bit strong (10/10) the hardest rocker on the cd. The chorus saves this song. <br /> <br />When the sun goes down(10/10): The best song on the cd. This one is going into heavy rotation on my ipod. <br /> <br />From the ritz to the rubble(10/10): Why the are so overrated could be put into this song. So many genres put into one song. <br /> <br />A certain Romance (8/10): A minor letdown nothing special.  Sort of sounds liek a song that didnt quite make a beatles cd <br /> <br />overall: 96% A
0440213525|5.0|I remember the movie on Sky some weeks back, and as with all well written books, it knocks spots off the big screen version. Grisham's portrayal of the eleven year old kid is masterful as he jumps into the kids head in every chapter. Absolutely gripping and highly believable.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The beginning of Star Wars or so they say!  I love sci-fi, I am a Trekie and a Star Wars buff, so naturally I like this stuff.  It was nice to see a well put together, different & imaginative movie put together on where it all started.
B000002KIE|5.0|The old vinyl LP hangs on my wall and I regularly play the new CD. It's one of the few albums I've had for over twenty years, that still gets a regular monthly and sometimes weekly play.<br /><br />The memories of that era are still so vivid, from the demonstrations of the middle aged parents outside the gigs, to Sid Vicious using the \\"F\\" word on live television.<br /><br />Every track is an absolute classic from \\"Bodies\\" to \\"Pretty Vacant\\". \\"God Save the Queen\\" and my all time favourite \\"Holidays in the Sun\\". Buy and listen to an album that probably ranks as the most infuential of its generation.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I love sci-fi, I am a Trekie and a Star Wars buff, so naturally I like this stuff.  I had this in the VHS version and now trying to get everything in the DVD version.  It is a good set for the Star wars buff!
033034837X|5.0|A young female scientist investigating some bizzarre goings on. Two twins, one good one evil, and more twists than a Chubby Checker appreciation dance. (I don't think that's how you spell Chubby Checker, ne'er mind, I didn't care for him much anyway!)<br /><br />Well researched, very well researched, an absolute must Read.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I first saw this movie at the theaters.  It is a different, but yet pleasant surprise type of movie.  One that shows how much our minds are taken for granted!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|This is a good movie for The Wall-Pink Floyd's most popular album. It really helped me understand the plot of The Wall a whole lot better: a drugged rock star who shuns himself from the world and imagines himself in the war like his father was. I was a little dissapointed when I found that they cut Hey You out of the movie... until I started paying closer attention: if you think about it, The Wall IS Hey You. Roger Waters said he wasn't completely happy with the movie, but it still turned out to be qite extraordinary. My only grudge with the movie is that they changed the dialogue between the characters a little and they shortened Waiting For The Worms(one of my favorite songs of The Wall), but overall, it's awesome and a must for all Floyd fans.
0743454537|5.0|My Sister's Keeper has to be the best book I've read in years. Written in journal format, you see the story from all character's points of view.  An amazing novel. I recommend it to everyone, young and old.
0385504209|4.0|I enjoyed the book for the simple reason that it kept me engaged at all times.  Some of the details were really a bit silly, but it would be hard to find a more entertaining read.  I don't go in for the underlying conspiracy theory, but it was interesting how the author was able to weave together so many different threads to at least make the case.
0671042858|4.0|Another winner by King.  It is every child's nightmare to be lost in the woods - as we all know that is where the monsters lurk. Young Trisha just happens to be unfortunate enough to be in this unenviable situation. She is all alone in the wilderness with no one to keep her company, except her walkman -so she can listen to her favorite baseball pitcher play. Of course, the batteries are running low. Trisha follows a stream, and has food and water, but there is a mysterious force following her. She questions if it is a hallucination, or the mythical Wendigo that hunts children.<br /><br />Read this book for a great scare, but be warned, you may not enjoy walking in the woods after.<br /><br />Relic113
0440178002|5.0|James Clavell's series of novels on Japan and China are the finest pieces of historical fiction ever produced.  Beginning with the epic Shogun, Clavell follows the narrative through Tai-Pan, Gai-Jin, Noble House and ultimately the loosely related King Rat and Whirlwind.  A perfect example of how reading for enjoyment and reading for educational purposes can be combined seamlessly.
0517220784|5.0|Here we have the complete cannon of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes works. Four Novels and 56 short stories. Usually, collections like this are poorly put together with unnecessary frills and padding. Here we have nothing but pure gold.<br /><br />Anyone who likes mystery, or literature must read the cannon of Holmes. See the famous expressions like \\"the game is a foot\\", and \\"when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable must be the truth\\"... Most enjoyable to me are Holmes amazing observations -where he looks at someone and can tell what they had for breakfast, and where they were a week ago from the dust on their shoes. It's really a fun read!<br /><br />So, if you want to solve the mystery of what to read next, the answer is elementary my good friends... Buy this book!<br /><br />Relic113
0671027387|4.0|My only argument with many of Brown's novels is that they sometimes strain credibility.  I can deal with conspiracy theory if it is even remotely plausible, but jumping out of helicopters and surviving, evil killers with almost superhuman abilities, etc. detract from my enjoyment.  This novel, on the other hand, is entirely plausible and equally entertaining.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is a wonderful version of Barrie's classic, and the casting above all, is exceptional. Rachel Hurd-Wood is a perfect choice to play Wendy, and the whole process of her transition to womanhood is handled very tastefully and intelligently. Anybody who has a problem with this, needs to see a psychiatrist. <br /> <br />After the (to me) disappointing \\"Hook\\" I was very wary of another attempt at Peter Pan, but this one is virtually flawless, and the special effects are beautifully integrated. I was surprised that the 'mermaids' scene was so brief, as it was very dramatic and well-shot, and could have been even more powerful had it explored more elements. <br /> <br />Isaacs is just outstanding, as is Sumpter, and it is difficult to conceive of a better cast than this one. The extras are also superb, making this an absolute bargain DVD.  <br /> <br />Truly a modern classic.
B000002UAI|4.0|If there is one annoying about this cd is the fact that there two versions: a 12 song and a 14 song version. <br />I can imagine that someone who bought the 12 song version gets annoyed when he or she discovers that there is a 14 song version!!!!!
B000002INR|5.0|One of my all time favorite hair metal CDs. \\"I Remember You\\" is an awesome ballad. \\"18 and Life\\" and \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" are great also. There are no crappy filler songs and the CD flows well. If you are a metal fan and don't have this CD, then you need to get it.
B000E1155E|5.0|The Arctic Monkeys have made the biggest impact on the music charts in Britain of 2006, and are the biggest rock band to do so since Oasis twelve years ago. The band will go down in history and they've only released one album. Building from internet hype alone, they became the most talked-about band in the country within a matter of weeks. Then their debut single went straight in at No.1. The second single followed in its predecessors footsteps, and then when the album was released in January 2006, the Monkey PR-machine went into overload.<br /><br />The Arctic Monkeys are hyped beyond belief. In my opinion they are also incredibly overrated, yet nothing can escape from the fact that this is a brilliant debut album. NME magazine ranked it as one of the top five debut rock albums ever. Again, incredibly overblown! However, \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not,\\" went straight in at No.1 in the UK album charts for more than a month and sold a record-breaking 363,735 copies in its first week on sale. Figures like this are completely unheard of for a debut album, putting this band in a difficult position; millions of fans but also millions of detractors, and so early on in their career.<br /><br />The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar), Jamie Cook (guitar), Andy Nicholson (bass), and Matthew Helders (drums). Their music is sort of a mixture between The Jam, Pulp and The Streets with traces of The White Stripes' Elephant era, with lyrics focusing on social commentary that reflects 21st Century life in Britain. The album opens with the brilliant \\"The View From The Afternoon.\\" Rumoured to be the third single, this song has a brilliant, stomping introduction and such a catchy first verse; \\"Anticipation has a habit to set you up! For disappoint in evening entertainment but...\\" The chorus is amazing as the guitars drive and crash up and down. \\"I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor\\" is the band's most famous song, and also their debut single. Released in October 2005, it crashed straight into the charts at No.1, and with good reason. The guitars on this song are just superb, and the lyrics are what made this song stand out from the crowd. Alex Turner's voice is at once staggering, at times sexy and rough, but always honest and truthful. It's probably the most popular anthem in pubs and bars around Britain of the past year - a real head banger!<br /><br />\\"Fake Tales From San Francisco\\" is one of my favourite songs on the album and could well be a single later this year. The guitar hook is incredibly catchy and the chorus is catchy as heck; \\"I don't want to hear you kick me out, kick me out!\\" This song is amazing when performed live, especially towards the end when the line \\"Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook!\\" roars into your ears. \\"Dancing Shoes\\" opens with a rollicking bass that will get your toes tapping from the offset. The vocal lines are brilliant, very loud and raucous. The chorus lets me down a bit because it disrupts the flow but I love it when Turner sings, \\"Get on your dancing shoes, you sexy little swine!\\" Had me in stitches for days. \\"You Probably Couldn't See For The Lights But You Were Staring Straight At Me\\" is one of my lesser favourite songs on the album, but it's barely two minutes long so it doesn't really make much of an impact. It's still got a great hook though, and the drumming is particularly impressive. \\"Still Take You Home\\" is an amazing song and has this brilliant melody that repeats itself over and over, really getting wedged into your brain. I don't reckon much to the verses, but the choruses are simply genius. Just the way the vocals are arranged is really impressive, and the breakdown around 1:54 will have you chanting anthemically with all your mates.<br /><br />\\"Riot Van\\" is a slower, softer song that tells the story of a group of riots wreaking havoc on the streets (of Sheffield, presumably). They really don't give a toss about the police and their efforts to rid the streets of yobs. Quite a controversial song really, but it does work and fit in with the image. \\"Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured\\" has a great guitar riff running through it, although the lyrics don't really make an impression. However, the line, \\"No surrender! No chance of retreat!\\" always stands out for some reason. \\"Mardy Bum\\" is one of the best songs on the album and would also make a fantastic single. The band are really sorted in terms of commercial singles for this album - they could probably get about 7 released in total that would all do well on radio. This song is a bit softer than the rest of the album, but a bit louder than the likes of Riot Van. The real gem in this song is in the chorus and the lyrical melody of the lines, \\"Up, up and away!\\" This reminds me of Brit-pop in the mid-Nineties, it's very Oasis/Blur-ish.<br /><br />\\"Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong But...\\" has an amazing bass at work as soon as the song kicks in. The main guitar riff is awesome too, and the chorus rocks hard because the vocals are only sung when no instruments are being played, stopping just before the instruments start up again. I love this style, it works so well in actually making the listener listen to the words. The instrumental section two minutes in is also a future-classic. \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" was the second single to be released from the album in January 2006 and went straight to No.1. I don't care too much for it, I think there's a lot better on this album, but I love it when the song starts properly after the line, \\"Said he's a scum-bag, don't you know?\\" The next song is \\"From The Ritz To The Rubble,\\" another song that I don't care too much for. This song sounds a bit too much like filler, but thankfully all is redeemed for the final song and album closer, \\"A Certain Romance.\\" This is the longest song on the album at five and a half minutes and will go down a storm at live shows and festivals. It has a brilliant introduction with guitars and drums rolling in at breakneck pace, which are suddenly obliterated for a sweet and melodic guitar riff some 37 seconds in. This is what makes this song so memorable for me, and the lyrics add a sense of completion to the whole thing; in other words, no other song could close the album better than this.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />I hate to feel like I'm just going with the crowd by praising The Arctic Monkeys, because we all know that if too many people begin to pile on the praise, it will, inevitably, become uncool to like them. However, I think you just have to go with your instincts and not be swayed by what everyone else thinks. In my opinion, this is a great rock album but I probably wouldn't have bought it this soon after its release were it not for the hype. So I suppose it works both ways. I hope they become big in America too because they're more deserving of dull as dishwater singers such as James Blunt. Don't mind me for vomiting. Alex and Jamie are also sexy too, and that's always a bonus. Check them out, I - and millions of others, no doubt - highly recommend them.ial song really, but it does work and fit in with the image. \\"Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured\\" has a great guitar riff running through it, although the lyrics don't really make an impression.

6304696515|4.0|Having read the original novel, I can really admire the director's execution of the plot, considering that the novel consists entirely of letters.  It must be really challenging for the screenplay writer to  work off the original text that consists of multiple first person narratives.  The screenplay writer and the director did a fine job of covering all the major points in the plot.  All the dialogues were recreated seamlessly.  The costumes were impeccable.  I didn't even mind the actors being American, because they left their American personas behind and entered a world completely unfamiliar to them.

B000DWMYQ8|4.0|Chicken Little will always be remembered as the CGI animated film that Disney did without Pixar, and that's too bad because when you get down to it, this is an engaging and fun little movie.  The writing (particularly in the dialogue) is genuinely funny.  It's helped immensely by some terrific voice acting and strong animation. <br /> <br />Personally, I loved Fish Out of Water.  What a great character.  But Chicken Little and Abby Mallard (aka Ugly Duckling) are nicely fleshed out, both sympathetic and likable.  One of the best things about the movie is how it deftly avoids most stereotypes.  Our hero is clever and thoughtful, neither a jock or a genius or a nerd.  And it's nice to see a love interest in a film who can actually not be beautiful or even pretty.  Hey, I know she's just a duck, but it's still progress.  I'd pay money for a poster of CL and Abbey holding hands at the end of the film.  So damn sweet and endearing. <br /> <br />Kids will like it, and heck, as an adult I enjoyed it, too.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I received the complete series of Firefly on DVD so fast, I couldn't believe it. The price of the item was impossible to pass up for well over ten hours of entertainment. If you're only mildly interested, you'll still get a great deal. If you really enjoy the series, you'll be delighted.
B0000029DD|2.0|I bought this CD because I heard the song Halleluiah on the movie The Edukators (pretty good movie) and the show House it is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.  Unfortunantly the rest of the CD just doesn't live up to it.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This one the worst WWII movies I have ever seen in my life.  If you think this movie is good then read a history book.  This movie is so wretched it makes some of the WWII propaganda movies put out by both sides look good.  The future is here and it's banal.      Some of the people who like this movie didn't like \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\".  What can you say to that?  There are people who like Kool-aid instead of a good wine.  Paris Hilton would like the movie \\"Pearl Harbor\\".      This movie makes little sense and has poor special effects.  You get to watch computer generated Zero fighters dance across the screen.  Yep, nothing is more convincing than a bad cartoon.  The movie takes four old Perry frigates and puts them on fire.  The real Pearl Harbor ships, like Arizona class battleships, look as much like a Perry class frigate as a 1920s Ford dump truck looks like a '80s era Ford Mustang.  The only people who are fooled are the uninformed.        There is only one - count it one -  good special effect in this movie.  That is when the battleship USS Oklahoma capsizes.  And a good viewer will just wish that was spliced in with \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\".      There are many out takes in this movie that are directly ripped off from \\"Tora, Tora, Tora.\\"  About half of the air field attacks were taken from that movie.    Bottom line here, folks.  Pearl Harbor does not just suck, it blows.  Ben Afflect is a pretty boy and is not convincing as a good military officer.  His best movie is \\"Mall Rats\\" and he fits that part.  Josh Hartnett redeems himself with the movie \\"Blackhawk Down\\", one of the best war flicks ever made.  In Pearl Harbor movie he is terrible.  Perhaps his pay check didn't clear the bank, who knows?  Then there is John Vought as FDR?  Please.  He should be on Mission Impossible.      If you like this movie then stick with your MTV.  Paris Hilton will be calling to see if you want to go dancing.  Kool-aid served with ice and a peanut butter sandwich is pretty good.    If you really like historal movies then get \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\", a five star movie.  If you want to find about Pearl Harbor then read \\"At Dawn we Slept\\" by Gordon Prange.      If you want to see raw hate on a movie then surf to steelnavy.com and post on the discussion board how you liked \\"Pearl Harbor\\".  It would be like hitting a hornet's nest with a stick.  Every time you hit \\"refresh\\" on your computer window you'll get to watch the posted hate messages multiply.    This movie would get a minus Star, if possible.  It is a black hole of a movie.  It takes in perfectly good ideas, actors, and turns it into a blackness.  It's terrible.     The worst thing is we can expect to see more movies like this in the future.
B000066744|5.0|I would personally rate this hauntingly beautiful movie among the best I've seen, and as others reviewers have said, it's worth watching for the music alone, even if you don't end up liking the story. <br /> <br />I first saw this movie, curiously enough, on a Lufthansa flight back in 2000 or so, and since then heard almost nothing else about it until I found it on a friend's Amazon wish list.  It doesn't have a typical Hollywood sort of plot, but I'm surprised at how little an impact it seemed to make even with people normally into this kind of film.
B000E1155E|5.0|I just listened to this band and am already buying the cd. As soon as I heard the first 30 seconds of one of the songs i LOVED them. Talk about the most brilliant music I have ever heard!! Amazing beat, great lyrics, just brilliant everything! GET IT! IT ROCKS! The UK is genius...

Will remember his name and make sure I dont bother ever again
B00005JLPK|5.0|I am always a little aprehensive about \\"art movies\\".  I should clarify that I use the term to mean movies about great artists (as opposed to what used to be the term to describe movies coming out of France and Scandanavia).  The reason for my reluctance is that, if the art itself doesn't impress me, then the movie probably won't either.  However, I recently watched \\"Amadeus\\" for the first time and was greatly impressed.  So, when I saw \\"Frida\\" on IFC's schedule, I thought I'd take a chance on that one as well.  Thank goodness that I did.  This, too, is an impressive movie. <br /> <br />I will admit that I knew nothing about the true-life artist, Frida Kahlo, although I vaguely recognized the name of her husband, Diego Rivera.  I'm sure that \\"Frida\\" must have been an exceptional experience for those who were already fans of her work before the movie came out.  However, I was impressed that prior knowledge of the woman was not a requirement for being able to enjoy \\"Frida\\".  The impact of the movie came from its' portrayal of the artist first and the art second.  Frida Kahlo was a vibrant woman who overcame many things because of her passion for life and love.  She backed-off for no one, even her wandering husband.  She overcame a serious accident that left her in pain and follow-up surgeries most of her life.  She did not compromise on expectations of anyone, including herself.  All of this we saw through the excellent directing of Julie Taymor and the Academy Award-nominated acting of Salma Hayek in the title role.  I did not see Nichole Kidman in \\"The Hours\\" so I can't complain too loudly about the injustice of Hayek not winning the award.  Let's just say that, if and when I get around to seeing \\"The Hours\\", I'll be expecting a lot. <br /> <br />The use of art in \\"Frida\\" was expected but the unique ways that it was blended in were exceptionally well-done.  History plays an important role in \\"Frida\\" as well with the assassination of Leon Trotsky (gee, I sure hope I'mnot giving anything away with that) being a special focal point for me. <br /> <br />\\"Amadeus\\" excelled in how it brought the man, the music and the times to life.  \\"Frida\\" excels by doing as well in all three areas.  I may prefer Wolfgang and his music to Frida and her art but I must confess that Frida and her art stand pretty high in my opinion after watching \\"Frida\\".
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Wonderful movie--I enjoyed the singing much better than any other production of Phantom.  Different, but better!
0380820846|4.0|For Colin Bridgerton, she has always been just Penelope. The extremely shy wallflower who been a constant in his life, a permanent fixture at all Bridgerton gatherings due to her close friendship with his sister. Yet twelve years later and he starts noticing things about her - her wit and intelligence, and even how big and expressive her brown eyes are. And for the very first time, Penelope is no longer the awkward girl who simply happened to be \\"just there\\". For the handsome and legendary charmer Bridgerton number three, it matters that Penelope Featherington, the woman who is starting to stir feelings deep within him, is there.<br /><br />When she was sixteen, Penelope fell in love with her friend's brother. But for the plain and gauche girl, the one always standing at the perimeter of the ballroom, yearning to be asked to dance, but bravely pretending she didn't care, it seemed that she was destined to watch him from afar. Then twelve years after longing for the one man who haunted her maidenly dreams, Penelope's secret prayer would finally be answered when she finally catches the eye of the charming Bridgerton brother.<br /><br />ROMANCING MR BRIDGERTON is another wonderful addition to the delightful series created by one of today's most brilliant historical romance writers. As clich&eacute;d at it was, I was so happy to see Colin and Penelope end up together. I thought it was just wonderful getting to know more about Penelope, learning about the intelligent and witty woman hiding inside the shy spinster whom the notorious Lady Whistledown has made a laughing stock of in her Society column. And Colin, of course, is just heavenly - always so charming and sexy.<br /><br />Featuring the wonderful Bridgerton family, especially the now grown-up Hyacinth who comes up with some witty remarks, this book is a fun and entertaining read that would leave you smiling. And I am glad to finally uncover the identity of Lady Whistledown and realize that I was right all along!
B0006L0LOS|1.0|Plot-less, script-less, and without a whisker of wit or cred, Catwoman is an insipid saussage in the assembly-line of super-hero movies:  kiddie product with millionaire budgets.  The big difference is that Catwoman has lowered the required viewer IQ from age ten to age five.      Even as a cartoon this concept would've flopped.    Halle Berry does no more than show off her bod as she parades/poses narcissistically from start to finish, every now and then uttering a laughably forgettable line.  Sharon Stone, who loves to boast about making 'intelligent flicks' (you'd think she writes her own material!), is your stock villain with no more depth than Berry's plank-of-wood acting.  The rest of the cast is just as painfully resource-less.  (Whoever played the cop should not have been allowed to graduate from high school if he took a drama class.)    The storyline treatment is a simplistic feminist yarn that reduces the cause to a bundle of overrehearsed gestures and slogans.  The jabs at the male-dominated system are caricaturesque at best, without a speck of insight or creativity.  If Berry and Stone thought they were somehow advancing the cause of women through parodic mainstream culture, they should stoop to read a book or take a course on the subject to get minimally educated (god forbid!).      It is a sign o' the times:  celebrities and product such as these -- with nothing to offer besides hollow image and wasteful budgets -- being overly marketed and rewarded by an industry intent on lowering the bar.  (By the way, is there anything this director CAN do well?)
0977326403|5.0|Good book to read.  I am a Phd student in public administration in NJ and this book ties in stuff I read about in HR administration and social sector.  Collins has done his research well, but I don't come across as many new ideas as I had hoped for.  All in all, it is worth reading.  I have not read his first book, but maybe this summer.
B00006LHYC|5.0|I was a little concerned about what I should expect from this first English album from Laura Pausini, though from certain previous performances she gave in english (One more time, the first mile etc), she showed that she can easily respond to the task. After all, she is capable of singing in various different languages! <br />Her unbelievable voice once again lifts you up. But nevertheless, no matter how good her performance is, there is no comparison with her Italian songs! Even a couple of older italian songs included here in their english version, they do not feel the same when you listen to them... Italian language, makes a lot of difference. So even if I would recomend this album to anyone, people who want to find out more about Laura, should get started with one of her Italian -or maybe spanish now she's got the Grammy for one of them (Escucha)- albums. <br />Which one? I couldn't say... I like them all the same. Perhaps \\"The Best of Laura Pausini, E Ritorno Da Te\\" which includes a lot of her hits, may be a good idea. <br />Enjoy! <br />Cristina
B00006LJ6X|4.0|Happy man, in it's form here, is shortened from the original album. Rhino would repeat this procedure with the Talking Heads reissue of The Name Of This Band Is The Talking Heads. To quote another reviewer in a review of that CD: 'Maddeningly, the producers at Rhino chose to remove this section from album, thereby breaking what is essentially rule number one of reissues. While it's okay to remove crowd noises or orchestrations added after the fact, NEVER, but NEVER, delete ANY MUSIC that was on the original release. EVER. FOR ANY REASON. Those very familiar with an original release will want everything that was on it initially, even the parts they didn't like'. Well said. Maybe it was done for time/space reasons, but I doubt it. Rhino, please fix this CD and that one soon! <br />

B000E1155E|5.0|I acquired this album as an import and it truly is the best recording I've heard in the past 2 years or more. Once you get it started it's almost impossible to skip a track. It will play until the end and you may even start it over again. All of the tracks have an absurd brilliance however \\"Fake Tales Of San Francisco\\" is as close to genius and one can get. The silent break in \\"Perhaps Vampires is a Bit Much...\\" when he kicks the vocals back in, I do a skip while listening to my ipod while waking the streets of NYC. Just plain awesome. <br /> <br />Franz Ferderwho and The Strokes (whose album dropped from the charts like a rock from a plane) could only dream of being this good. <br /> <br />Amazing! Simply amazing! This is a grand slam from beginning to end. If you can't say something good about this album keep it to yourself and stop being a player hater. Celebrate these guys for not wallowing in self pity and having a good time while telling fun and good stories. Like the Arctic Monkeys \\"I don't want to hear your fake tales of not liking this band.\\" <br /> <br />My only complaint is that The Arctic Monkeys will be playing New York City in March while I'm on vacation. Shame on you. I'll be taking it with me.
B00000IMTF|5.0|I'm sick of all of these audiophile douches attacking remastered albums, for whatever band, but especially this one. Lets face it; when CDs first came out, while they were an improvment over wax, they still had limited capability in sound reproduction. However, in the mid to late 90's, record companies started to give classic albums, such as this one, proper sound treatment. I have both the \\"old\\" version of *Rising* and the \\"new\\" 1999 version. The 99 version blows the old one out the friggin window in terms of sound qaulity, and as far as i know, there isn't any \\"remixing\\" as far as i can tell. This is no Ozzy Osbourne stunt of re-mixing and re-recording  musicians, it's just the way the album originally came out, with the exception of better clarity and a little louder. Whats wrong with that?  <br /> <br />The whole series of remasters from this band is exellent, better packageing, better sound.
B00005JNJV|4.0|When I was a kid, I grew up with the superhero comics:  Batman, Superman, Daredevil, Spiderman, Supergirl, and others. When the superhero movies started coming out, I know I always used this \\"comic knowledge\\" as a reference point to determine whether the screenplay was true to the character.  Superman being slowed down by a car thrown on him?  Give me a break!  The Hulk bounding across the landscape and avoiding pursuit?  Yeah!<br /><br />Batman movies have been just okay...I'd say they tried to be more true to the Adam West TV character than the comics.  Artistic license, I guess.  They've never been my favorite.<br /><br />Then came Batman Begins.<br /><br />This is a great movie for the comic-based Batman buff.  The movie \\"answers\\" a number of questions.  Why bats anyway?  How did a billionaire playboy get these fighting skills with no one noticing?  How do you just happen to build a house around the Bat Cave (or vice versa)?  Where did Batman's suit and gadget technology come from, since Bruce Wayne never even finished college (actually, I'm not sure about the finishing college, but I think not)?  And who designed, in secret, the Batmobile?  Where did all of those psycho adversaries come from?  What was the origin of police commissioner Gordon's bond with Batman?  How did the bat signal get established?  My personal favorite was Bruce Wayne's learning process... he bounced off a number of roofs and walls before he figured things out!<br /><br />This movie was very entertaining, with lots of action.  Michael Caine as Alfred the butler is a hoot!  Jim Gordon was all cop action.  Ducard (Liam Neeson) was okay, but a bit too much mumbo jumbo... Gotham City at its worse was never Sodom and Gomorrah!<br /><br />The PG-13 rating is probably appropriate for the fighting scenes, but it could just as easily been a PG.
B000E1YVZU|3.0|Having seen RENT on the stage with the eardrum assaulting, miked sound from each performer's head mike coupled with the small but deadly 'pit band' this viewer rented this film with trepidation.  And after paying close attention to the transfer of the play to the screen little has change in feelings about this work.<br /><br />Loosely based on Puccini's 'La Boheme' (with some direct quotes in the score) this musical drama has much to say about AIDS, kids as artists, survival, all forms of gay life, extended family - many subjects that make it worthy of production.  The cast performs extremely well from the opening 'Chorus Line' takeoff  through the intimate and blaring production numbers. The pacing is excellent, the cinematography is good, the mood is right.  So why the three star rating?  For this viewer/listener the score is so thread bare and trite that it is difficult to understand why it has attracted such huge success. There is one song (which opens the show) and otherwise the rest of the score melts into an indistinguishable m&eacute;lange of repetition.  The cast carries it off admirably, but at the end of the work the impact is more in the idea than the execution.  Overrated. Grady Harp, February 06

B00005JNJV|5.0|The \\"Batman\\" concept has had an iron grip on American pop culture for decades, but for some reason the various adaptations of the Caped Crusader's tales to the Big Screen have been at best acceptable, and their worst, despicable.  Whatever the reason, there hasn't been a film version of \\"Batman\\" that really captured the essence of the \\"Batman\\" stories. <br /> <br />Until now, that is.  Christopher Nolan, of \\"Memento\\" fame, has made arguably the best \\"comic book\\" film ever with \\"Batman Begins.\\"  (I know, fans of \\"X-Men 2\\" and \\"Sin City\\" get riled up with that assertion, but as Gene Hackman says in \\"Crimson Tide,\\" \\"It's a short list.\\")  Taking the \\"Batman\\" story closer to the \\"Dark Knight\\" versions of our hero and eschewing the more campy elements of other interpretations, Nolan takes an all-star cast and makes a movie that should have George Clooney, Val Kilmer, and even Michael Keaton calling their agents and screaming, \\"This is the 'Batman' picture I should have made!\\" <br /> <br />Christian Bale takes over the title role, and works wonders with it.  Batman has always been a difficult hero to personify.  Not only is he a brilliant, daring muscleman, he has to possess the vulnerability brought about by the tragic loss of his parents.  He also has to bring off the \\"billionaire playboy\\" public persona of Bruce Wayne.  No actor donning the Bat Cape yet has achieved this balance with the same ease as Bale - perhaps this isn't surprising, since Bale has been disappearing into wonderful characters long before \\"American Psycho\\" -- his work as a young lad in 1987's \\"Empire of the Sun\\" and Kenneth Branagh's \\"Henry V\\" in 1989 was very impressive.   <br /> <br />To \\"help out the young guy,\\" Nolan and his team assembled an all-star supporting cast, to say the least.  Michael Caine brings the necessary dignity to Alfred the Butler, but also the necessary affection and humor.  Gary Oldman is remarkably restrained as the lone straight arrow in the Gotham City police department asa young Jim Gordon.  Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe are creepy as young Wayne's tutors in the nefarious League of Shadows (more on them in a second).  Tom Wilkinson plays a gutter-boy-made-it-big crime lord.  Rutger Hauer plays a minor villain, as a deceitful corporate hack in charge of Wayne Enterprises.  Cillian Murphy (\\"28 Days Later\\") brings a youthful menace to the Scarecrow.  And once again, Morgan Freeman almost steals the show as Wayne Enterprises' resident technical genius (and source for all the infamous Batman gizmos) Lucius Fox.   <br /> <br />Only Katie Holmes, as Wayne's love interest and young D.A. Rachel Dawes, seems a bit overwhelmed by all this star power.  But I guess Scarlett Johannson can't be in *every* movie.   <br /> <br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is aptly titled, as the movie spends most of its time telling the tale of how Bruce Wayne forged the alter ego Batman after his parents were gunned down before his eyes as a lad of ten or so.  Wayne, struggling with guilt over his innocent role in his parents' murder as well as the crushing weight of his family's wealth and legacy, tries to research the criminal mind by hanging out with criminals and spending time in foreign jails as a petty thief.   <br /> <br />There he is \\"tapped\\" by Henri Ducard (Neeson) as the chief trainer in the League of Shadows.  The League, a collection of ninja-warriors, has been dispensing its draconian form of justice for centuries.  Whenever a civilization gets too corrupt, the League brings it down so civilization can start anew.  \\"We sacked Rome.  We were there when London burned.\\"  Neeson's Ducard is quite insane, but his insanity is so restricted by his rigid code of justice that he is more or less kept in check.  Wayne is stellar during the training, but he balks at the League's more draconian beliefs, and Wayne's belief in redemption sparks what is certain to be a long-standing feud between Wayne and the survivors of the League (oh, yeah, Wayne single-handedly burns their headquarters to the ground, which may require the League to \\"get reacquainted\\" with Wayne later in the movie). <br /> <br />Wayne returns \\"from the dead\\" to Gotham City just in time for the Scarecrow, Dr. Jonathan Crane, to unleash his plot to bring the city to its knees using a hallucinogenic drug and the city's water main.  All I'll say about that is that this plot line builds to one of the most amazing fight scenes imaginable involving Gotham City mass transit and the tank-like Batmobile. <br /> <br />A visual splendour, \\"Batman Begins\\" is also more realistic than the more recent stylized \\"Batman\\" movies.   <br /> <br />I imagine a review of \\"Batman Begins\\" is redundant if you're already a Batman fan -- you've already seen this movie, probably more than once.  But if you've stayed away from Batman because of the terrible reputation of the previous movies, or the Adam West TV show, or because it's a 'comic book movie,' you should watch \\"Batman Begins.\\"  It is a great entertainment, and hopefully the start of a great new line of movies about the Caped Crusader.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album made me a fan. At first, I loved (and still do) Hung Up so much. But, I didn't buy the album right away because I was skepticle. Then, rolled on Sorry, the second single. I was hooked big time. So, I decided to give this Madonna disk a try. What I wanna say is that if you like Hung Up and Sorry enough, there's no reason not to check this CD out. Most other songs are as good (if not better) as the two. Loving \\"Confessions\\" so much, I've started navigating through her back cataloque. So far, Ray of Light is also very good.

0743454537|5.0|The emotions raised by this novel quite literally scorched my heart as I read.  The basic set-up is entirely believeable given the state of reproductive technology today.  Two parents decide to use technology to create an embryo that is a genetic match for their daughter, who is dying of aggressive leukemia, with the expectation that the new baby will be able to donate cord blood, and perhaps other tissues, that will save their girl.  The second daughter, once born, becomes an eternal donor for her older sister, until one day at the age of 13, she decides to refuse to donate one of her kidneys.  In fact, the younger girl takes her parents to court to prevent them from forcing her to donate the kidney, and this is the heart of the story.<br /><br />The character of the mother, Sarah, is so well drawn that she is downright scary.  She made me ask, \\"What kind of mother would be so calculating as to deliberately create a child to serve as an organ donor?\\"  Even as Sarah expresses love and fierce devotion to the elder child (Kate) she seems completely unaware of the pain and fear that the donation process has for Anna, the second daughter.  It was interesting to me how much I could dislike this character even when she was described as loving and caring.  It just seemed appalling to me that a person would actually create a child strictly for the purpose of providing tissue and organs to another.  That act alone, regardless of all the other warm and fuzzy things the character did, doomed her in my estimation.<br /><br />Interestingly, the author managed to portray the second, daughter (Anna) as both willing and unwilling to retain her donor role, and of having both of these feelings at the same time.  This character is also very well drawn, and very believeable.  She has simply accepted her role in the family, unconventional as it is, in much the same way that many of us accept the roles we are assigned within a family structure.  In a way, it is not so surprising that Anna would just fall into her assigned role, since neither she nor her sister knows any different way to be.<br /><br />They have a brother, though, (Jesse) who seems to understand intuitively that Anna has a special role, which makes her more valuabale to the family than he is.  This decimates Jesse's life, causing him to act out in a range of socially unacceptable ways, something the mother and father come to ignore after awhile.  It's like they can't be bothered to address Jesse's problems because they are consumed with Kate's illness.  That is another aspect of the parental characters that appalled me -- that these people would just give up on their only son, rather than trying to help him see that he was dear to them and his siblings whether or not he was a genetic match that would be of use to the sick sister.<br /><br />As some other reviewers have noted, the ending of this novel is a surprise.  Something quite unanticipated takes place, which didn't trouble me, as I have learned in life that many unpredictable events can and do take place rather commonly. The genuinely interesting thing is that Anna ends up as a donor because the choice is taken out of her hands.  It seems as if the donor role is simply Anna's fate, and nothing she does can change that.  In a way, this reminded me of those dark novels of Thomas Hardy and other 19th century British authors.  A character, particularly a female character, marches inexorably toward her fate, as if biology truly is destiny.<br /><br />Regardless of your opinion of the characters in this novel, the subject matter is bound to keep you thinking long after you've finished reading.

B000BJS4TO|4.0|The approach composer John Williams used in writing the score for the visually arresting MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is for this listener the most sensitive he has ever demonstrated in a long line of successful movie scores.  Much of this is due to his incorporating the Japanese ancient instruments into the overall compositional elements.  He collaborated with and utilized the talents of Masayo Ishigure, Hiromi Hashibe, Masae Yoshizawa and the Pro Musica Nipponia Ensemble to add the needed depth to the atmospheric music he composed.<br /><br />Of course electing to use Itzhak Perlman and Yo-Yo Ma as soloists is a major plus.  Ma especially, after his own investigation of the spectrum of Asian music he gained from his Silk Road recordings, understands how to make the cello imitate then blend with the Japanese instrument sound.  It is seamless, it is beautiful.<br /><br />Often CDs of movie music scores have a few good moments that recall the film, the rest being filler.  But in this CD the entire selection of excerpts is first rate and offers the listener not only a true remembrance of the film but also an appreciation for the differences and similarities between Eastern and Western music.

B000BT97AO|5.0|Wow, just wow.  This movie is spectacular, and along with \\"Junebug\\" a frontrunner for my best of 2006 movie list (based on when I first see movies, usually on DVD).  This is written by Neil Gaiman, and if you like his writing you'll definitely want to see this.  Well, you will if you also like his writing for children, a category into which this falls.  Luckily for me, my favorite Gaiman work is his children's novel \\"Coraline\\", which I absolutely love, so loving this movie is not a stretch. <br /> <br />The real strongpoint of the film is it's fantastic artistic direction, which is beautiful and very original.  There is some good humor in the film as well.  I particulary liked when the main character's sidekick is trying to get the giant floating creatures, who speak very slowly, to talk faster.  I really did laugh out loud. <br /> <br />The movie itself received very mixed reviews.  But I can't understand how anyone couldn't like this.  OK, maybe not love it as much as I do, but to dislike it as much as some critics--all I can do is shake my head.  Roger Ebert didn't like it, but I'll quote his cohost Richard Roeper, \\"It's so beautiful and so different and has such a unique feel to it.\\"  But it's interesting to note that an all-time favorite of mine, \\"Labyrinth\\", of which this is reminiscent at times, also got very mixed reviews when it came out.  If you liked that one, you'll probably enjoy this as well. <br /> <br />The lead actress, Stephanie Leonidas, is very good, and quite beautiful as well.  As Richard Roeper notes in his review, she reminds him of a young Helena Bonham-Carter, definitely one of the most beautiful actresses in the world.  I'd note that Ms. Leonidas is a little more exotic looking, and a little darker of complexion, due to her probably Greek background (I'm guessing from her last name).  Once she gets a little older--she's 21, though playing an unnamed younger age in Mirrormask--and gets a little more film work in, I suspect I'll add her to the most beautiful actress list too.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I didn't discover the TV show until they re-aired it on the SciFi channel before the movie came out.  What a great show.  My wife, who has a pathological aversion to all things science fiction and fantasy, actually liked both the series and the movie.  I think the thing that really sets both appart is character development.  A lot of material in this genre is focused on the fictitional \\"universe\\" created and character development is secondary (or tertiary or nonexistant).  The characters in Serenity and Firefly are the primary focus and they are real, interesting, and funny.  Highly recommended.

B000002J1U|5.0|The first Zep song I ever heard was Bron-Y-Aur Stomp.  It has been my favorite song ever since.<br /><br />What people hate about this album is the fact that it isn't bluesy and heavy.  It's more folky.<br /><br />This is the album that showed just how wide of a range of music Zep could do.  Physical Graffiti continued in that vain, but it was LZ III that showed their true talent.<br /><br />I love the acoustic sets on here because they are powerful in a different way.  They don't blast through the speakers so people can bang their heads and party-heavy.  This is the mellow side of Zep.  It's for those who want to hear the band, but don't want heavy music.<br /><br />That's why this album is perfect.  You can still appreciate Led Zeppelin even when your in a mellow mood, not looking for the heavy riffs.
0553801503|3.0|Perhaps it was inevitable that George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series threw out a relative clunker.  Expectations for the fourth novel in this immensely popular series, \\"A Feast For Crows,\\" could not have been higher unless J.R.R. Tolkien came back from the dead to write a detailed manuscript about the Second Age.   <br /> <br />I wanted to dive into \\"FFC\\" and devour the latest doings of Martin's huge cast of heroes, scoundrels, wizards and barbarians.  And I did, with high hopes.  And the early chapters did not disappoint.  The old Martin style was there -- sarcastic, biting, hard-core, savage, cynical, occasionally beautiful -- but as the chapters went on, and on, and on . . . my patience grew thin. <br /> <br />All of the sudden, I was reminded of the Michael Douglas character in \\"Wonder Boys.\\"  He toils on his second novel -- his first novel was a huge success, but was written seven years earlier, and it's time for a new book. He sits at his typewriter, working on a page numbered with four digits, and you notice that his office is filled with reams and reams of paper, and they comprise \\"the book.\\"  As one of his students reluctantly tells him later, your writing is beautiful, but it looks like you haven't made any choices.   <br /> <br />There are many parallels to Martin's latest work. <br /> <br />Martin, probably (and understandably) tired of America's Tolkien-worship, has bragged before that sure Tolkien's books were great and they were vast and they were huge, but all of Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy would fit in \\"one of my books.\\"  That's not necessarily a good thing.  Martin did an amazing job in the first three novels spinning a huge tale over the vast canvas of Westeros.  The books were indeed mammoth, but they were also pretty lean, and Martin drove the story forward relentlessly.  (And what a story it is!) <br /> <br />But in \\"FFC,\\" the momentum falters considerably.  About half-way through the novel, I realized that I had very little idea how these various episodes I was reading about in the isolated chapters (Martin retains his use of rotating the \\"point of view\\" of the story for each chapter through a handful of characters) related to the overall story.  Indeed, about 3/4 of the way through, I had to go back to a fan website and get a refresher on the basic plot of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire.\\"  These are not good things.  We are in Book Four of an announced seven-volume series, and things should be coming clearer rather than murkier. <br /> <br />It's true that Martin has created a wonderful world with Westeros and populated it with a rich cast of characters.  And in general I like to roll up my sleeves and dive into alternate worlds like that, exploring their minutiae and mastering the minor details that make the world so rich.  (That's why even my copy of Tolkien's \\"Silmarillion\\" was dog-eared, even though the prose was workmanlike, to say the least -- Middle-Earth was just such a compelling world!)   <br /> <br />But this is a huge challenge, as the author must put enough story into the text to justify this huge world.  I have no idea how various events advance this storyline at all.  Sansa Stark is stuck in the Eyrie with a spoiled brat of a lord and a conniving Littlefinger, and while we get some clever scenes of Littlefinger's machinations and Sansa's coming to terms with her new world, nothing freaking happens!  Just so with Arya Stark -- she heads to Braavos and has adventures that seem completely cut off from the rest of the novels.  Sam Tarly head south from the Wall to become a maester at the command of John Snow.  He spends some time in Braavos, and nearly meets up with Arya, but this opportunity is intentionally missed.  Brienne of Tarth rides all over creation, seeking the Stark girl.  The fifteenth time I read that Brienne was self-conscious about her physique and how she had been mistreated by men before, I got irked. <br /> <br />I've always thought that Peter Jackson's film adaptation of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is the best book-to-movie adaptation I've ever seen.  One of the best things Jackson did was that he eliminated the elements of Tolkien's novels that did not drive the story forward along the arc he and his writers chose, which was that the movies were going to be about Frodo's story.  I suspect that if Jackson read \\"FFC,\\" he would have as much use for half of the book's pages as he did for the character of Tom Bombadil, who gets a couple of chapters in \\"Fellowship\\" but never appears or is even named in the movies.   <br /> <br />George Martin is one of my favorite writers, largely based on the first three novels of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire,\\" but also his Southern-gothic vampire novel, \\"Fevre Dream.\\"  He has earned my trust, so I am going to stick with \\"Ice and Fire\\" through the planned seven books.  Maybe in the later novels, some of the developments of \\"FFC\\" will become more compelling, and I will give it another read.  But while I was pleasantly spent at the conclusion of \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" now that I've reached the end of \\"FFC,\\" I'm just tired (and eager to read the new Bernard Cornwell novel!).
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find out that including this beloved movie the DVD comes with so many fun extras.  There is a game which retells some US History during Annie's time.  A Karaoke style sing along with four or five of the famous songs.  Plus there is a section which the actress who played Annie talks to us about how to act and you can act along with Annie for a few scenes.  I thought it was a lot of fun!  Plus of course, the movie itself is just amazing.  I was surprised to get so much at such a great price.
6305428425|4.0|This is one of those films where you can expect to smile (and sometimes laugh, actually) all through the film. However, do not expect a script that would apply to daily life. Some of the things are exaggerated for the fun value. There's these two ladies who have been friends for some time, and now they hear that a high school re-union is coming up. They keep thinking that they are inferior to the others and want to impress the others at the re-union after all those years so they get into a role playing. Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow are really very successful and funny in this film, I especially like Sorvino's playing. The film is not meant to be very serious, so don't expect a script that reflets with 100% accuracy the daily lives of people. This is meant to be as a funny story of two people to entertain the viewer and I believe it's quite successful in doing that. Get some snacks, get your favorite drink and start watching to see who invented Post-Its.
6305744793|5.0|There are a ton of terrible movie adaptions of television shows out there.  This ISN'T one of them.  Raul Julia was superb in the role of Gomez, the rest of the cast is excellent as well, add a fresh script that stays close to the TV show, and you have the ingredients for an excellent film!
B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Down started strong. Then they got airplay and political and it all fell apart there. I wish they would return to there first cd. Its one of the best metal cds out there and always a great listen.
1401200605|4.0|In the review from 'Publisher's Weekly' they say, and I quote, \\"...Catwoman, whom he [Batman] teams with in a rousing (though improbably evenly matched) brawl with Superman.\\" I just want to point out that this is not entirely correct.  <br /> <br />(Please note I choose my words carefully since I don't want to give too much away. This graphic novel rocks out and I highly recommend reading it.) <br /> <br />But back to my point...the 'brawl' as they call it takes place with Batman's thoughts sort of narrating...and he makes a point of mentioning that he knows Superman was holding back during the fight, because if Superman hadn't then he would have pretty much gotten smashed to a pulp. <br /> <br />I appreciated that comment more then anything else in the book/comic. It shows how the author recognizes the impossibility of a fight between the two of them, but still found a way to play it out in spite of that. It was WELL DONE and I'm miffed at that review casting a negative light on a skillful balancing act.  <br />
0316234753|5.0|Ed Emberley's book, Make A World, was a big part of my entertainment as a child while spending summers at the cabin.  Now that I am a grandmother, I have purchased nearly all of his books, including 'Drawing Book of Animals' and have rediscovered the joy of being able to 'do it myself' right along with them!  Having books such as this around the house goes a long way to encouraging kids to step away from the computer and the video games and to create something fun all by themselves.  These books make a great gift when given with a doodle pad and a box of colored pencils. Tucked inside of a colorful totebag, they are ready to go anywhere!  Keep it up, Ed!
6305736650|5.0|The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman in this film is amazing. Their expressions tell it all. The first time the two of them see each other in the film, you can see the whole history of the relationship just in Bergman's face. And for a romance this movie has a real plot, revolving around the Nazi occupation of French-Africa. Bergman's husband played by Paul Henreid is actually the leader of the Czech-resistance who keeps escaping from the Nazis.  <br /> <br />The real story though is Bergman's and Bogart's. It is a classic story of love and sacrifice, but Bogart's classic tough guy attitude, and his chemistry with Bergman makes this film unforgettable. <br />
B00005U11Z|5.0|It was like bringing back all the sweet memories of Journey.  I sat back at watched, and it made me feel so good to see them again.  Felt like I was at one of their concerts.  I am a huge Journey fan and always will be.  Anyone who is a die-hard fan like me, needs to purchase this dvd!  It was awesome!
B00008H2LB|4.0|I know, Linkin Park arn't exactly the coolest band in the world, and they get A LOT of Jip off people trying to be 'cool' and sometimes from people who genuinley don't like it, which is fair enough. Personally, I can like bands like Slipknot, Disturbed, S.O.A.D., and Mushroomhead (if you havn't heard of them check them out)- and so what if I like Linkin Park too? <br /> <br />This album is as strong a performance as you would expect from Linkin Park (like it or not) it has catchy choruses, good rapping and the same old guitar and drums, here are my favourite songs- <br /> <br />INRO- 1/5 Kinda pointless, why didn't they just put it on the start of... <br /> <br />DONT STAY- 3/5 A solid performance, gets boring quick though. <br /> <br />SOMEWHERE I BELONG- 4/5 Took me a while to start to like, loving that chorus. <br /> <br />LYING FROM YOU- 5/5 One of my favourites, alot of emotion in the chorus and an overall great song. <br /> <br />HIT THE FLOOR- 5/5 Great, I love the screaming that everyone else seems to hate, oh well... <br /> <br />EASIER TO RUN- 1/5 Uuurgh, no, just no, don't ask why. <br /> <br />FAINT- 5/5 This song breaks away from the similiarity of all the other songs by throwing in a pretty neat violin, nice rapping. <br /> <br />FIGURE .09 4/5 Its no different from any other song on the album, still pretty catchy though. <br /> <br />BREAKING THE HABIT- 5/5 AAAAAAAARGH! I've heard this song so many times, some people never tire of it, why? I guess it was a great song when I hadn't heard it so many times, very different. <br /> <br />FROM THE INSIDE- 2/5 Suspiciously like Easier to Run, only a bit better. <br /> <br />NOBODY'S LISTENING- 1/5 Yep, nobody's listening to this trash alright, it gets one star for unique japanese flutes. <br /> <br />SESSION- 4/5 A pretty cool track, no singing but this song can really fit your mood. <br /> <br />NUMB- 4/5 Like the keyboard tune, overplayed sadly, by MTV. <br /> <br />Well, I think Linkin Park could definetly do better, the thing that gets me is that the guitars and drums are so uninteresting, could you throw in a SOLO OR TEN? <br /> <br />There is so much potential for this band but all the songs are the same and the lyrics are all about how he hates himself or wishes someone would leave him alone. They could sing about something that doesn't make you wanna hurt yourself or at least something different. <br /> <br />This band really needs a boost of originality or something fresh, then they wouldn't get dissed as much by 'cool' people. Oh, and don't sing with or act like chavs (Jay Z, I didn't buy it). <br />I think Ive went on long enough, hope you read this review with an open mind. <br />Linkin Park's Meteora- 89%
015626224X|5.0|Down and Out in Paris & London is a very vivid read. I found it funny and heartbreaking at the same time.  I walked the streets and felt the hunger and cold with the charaters.
B000B8I8X2|4.0|I love roadrunner records....i've been raised on this kind of stuff....and when i heard that they were gathering all my favorite band members together to make a cd...i couldn't believe it. bought it the day it came out and loved it except for one song...\\"No Way Out\\"    Instrumentally...it was beautiful . i never thought joey could belt out something like that....but he did....i just thought the vocals killed it... overall this cd is great but i just wish the vocals for that song could've been different....
B000001ESF|5.0|If your not a fan of Rush, then there is no popint in reading any further because no matter what I write, you won't get past your \\"the drummers o.k. but I can't stand the singers voice\\" bias of the band. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of Rush, then there is no point in reading any further because you already own this and am only ordering it again because the old one is eithor on vinyl,cassette, or 8 track...or your cd it too scratched to play. <br /> <br />For those who have only recently discovered Rush, get this disc NOW. This is a must have for any fan of Rush. Among their top 3 releases. From the great sci-fi power metal title track to the often overlooked ballad \\"Tears\\", this their 4th album, sounds as fresh today, as when it was released.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|I have loved this movie since its debut.  My son (17) and I caught it on a cable channel and he fell in love with it also.   He begged me to order it for our collection.  I normally don't like changes to old music, movies, etc. like alterations and remakes.  This director's cut has such subtle changes that I feel they only enhance the whole package.
B000274THQ|4.0|Ich war sehr froh, diesen Film bei Amazon.com zu finden. Nicht nur ist die Geschichte historisch interessant, sie ist auch  <br />-und ich als \\"alter Ossi\\", der die Wendezeit miterlebt hat, kann es bestaetigen- auf humoristische Weise dargestellt wurden. Leider kann man den Film auf Grund von zu viel nackter Haut (in einer Szene) fuer den Unterricht nicht benutzen.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|ONe of the best movies I've ever seen. Keeps you on the edge of your seat even if you'd seen it before. You don't need to see the show to understand the movie. It's just that good.
0899663036|4.0|As a middle-aged man in the 21st century, I did not expect much from a story -- even a famous one -- about a young girl set in Brooklyn 100 years ago.  The only reason I considered reading it was a comment from a reviewer here on Amazon, a young lady who seemed to have excellent literary taste and who cited it as her favorite novel. <br /> <br />A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a force of nature.  Author Betty Smith, like Theodore Dreiser, formed piercing views of social conditions and expressed them through literature. Her arch gaze falls on an elementary school teacher here, a Tammany Hall politician there, small neighborhood merchants everywhere, and reveals an iron judgment that convinces as it informs.  The weirdest aspect is that much of what she decries still pertains today.  <br /> <br />The main theme is the novel's paean to the benefits of learning.  The story line is filled with interest; this book is simply unforgettable.  Francie Nolan and her immediate family will remain in the reader's head long after this volume is returned to the shelf.
B000B5IPLK|4.0|this is a great cd, a must have for any music lover...  <br /> <br />[...]
B000068IEU|1.0|In watching this low-budget horror flick, one can't help but wonder how many violent acts against women it and other similar movies have spawned.
B00005RHGK|5.0|Being a horror and suspense fan, the Jeepers Creepers movie is the best of the modern horror phenomena, using psichology to induce horror in a great way and an oustanding sound, you really enjoy this thriller. For this movie I give a thumbs up and congrats for the filmakers.
B000065BPB|4.0|First it should be known that I am not an audiophile so I don't consider myself expert enough to rate a product as great.  But I am very happy with the sound quality, sturdy construction, and comfort.  I kind of wish they were made a tad bit bigger but I have a fairly big head and they still fit comfortably.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Tremors, a great history with the classic horror suspense you like to have. The Legacy takes you further more, getting to know all the history of the monsters and the characters, a must have for every horror fan.
0060899190|4.0|This was a gift for a 18 year old. She enjoyed it very much.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This album is just what it says, 27 number 1 hits on 1 CD.   <br /> <br />If you don't like all the songs on the album or you think other songs should have been replaced by others, you should reread the sticker on the album \\"27 number 1 hits on 1 CD\\".  It is what it says it is.   <br /> <br />Everyone has personal favorites by The Beatles many of which will not be on this album, when this is the case I would suggest buying all the albums that have songs on them that you like and make your own Beatles favorites album.   <br /> <br />For the price you can't beat this album of 27 number 1 hits for under $12.00!  <br /> <br />The Beatles are arguably the biggest influence in rock music yesterday or today.  They can not and will not be equaled or surpassed.  They are considered the number 1 biggest icons of the 20th century.  What more can be said.  The Beatles are the best! <br />
B000B0WODA|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet.  If you liked their debut effort, the song-writing is much improved on this one and it is overall a much better album.  Highly recommended. There are not really any weak tracks on this cd.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|A great mesh of songs from the Meddle/Dark Side of the Moon era, brilliantly performed and recorded.  A few interviews and studio shots as well.
B00004W52U|5.0|THis is such a great CD, 27 amazing songs that will fill anyones needs. Every song is worth listening to. The singing is executed perfectly with such speed and rythym. I wish I couldve seen these guys live, I bet it would have been full of ENERGY, haha indeed.  <br />Fav songs: Here We Go Again, Hoboken, Room Without a Window, Vulnerabilty. <br />The lyrics are great, very relateable. Buy this CD if you like fast paced punk music with a passion.
B000BT97AO|5.0|From the first time I heard about this movie I wanted to see it.  However, it never played in a theater close to me.  It was worth the wait.   <br /> <br />This movie invokes past works of Henson, Gaiman, and McKean.  I am a fan of all three, so this is biased.  This movie is like watching a graphic novel.  Interesting story, incredible visuals, and comic wit.   <br /> <br />Unlike Labyrinth you care about the humans in this movie.  The doesn't start drab, it kicks in with interesting visuals and fun characters.  Then it goes into the \\"other\\" reality and that's when it takes your breath away.  It also reminded me of some of the artwork and video's of David Bowie (his Outside period)  <br /> <br />This movie could be too much for your standard movie watcher.  However; for the non standard movie watcher, those both cerebral and artistic, this movie is for you.  It's what most studios are afraid to do. <br /> <br />Give your brain some food.  Watch Mirrormask.
B0007N1AI6|2.0|This Album was not at all up to the standard of Judas Priest. I enjoyed many of their albums such as Painkillers, British Steel, Point of Entry and etc. This album is not any good. There are 3 decent songs on here:  <br />Demonizer,Hellrider,Lochness . <br /> <br />Download those songs then move on. I am pretty sure I'll get negative feedbacks for this, but come on here people, Are you even listening to this before reviewing it? If you wanted a good Painkillers sounding album, pick up Halfords Resurection. <br /> <br />Judas Priest is dead, like Black Sabbath. Stuck in a endless rut of trying to make everyone in their fanbase happy. Because of this, the music is souless. Take a lesson from Iron Maiden, boys!  <br />
B00003CXI1|4.0|I really liked the books better.  But...my kids love this movie.  I thinks because they get to see other kids being heroes and having adventures.  And of course, Harry and Co. are good role models, not perfect, but definetely the good guys.
B00005MP58|3.0|This has now become my favorite movie to watch.  I enjoyed it so much that I went to the library and checked out the book so I could clarify some things.  Oops, I probably shouldn't have said that. Please let me know if there are other movies out there that are this good.
B00005JMUA|5.0|As with Volume 1, this delivers just what the action film fan is seeking - plenty of outragious action.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye is from the suburbs of chi-town & makin it BIG in the rap Game!!! This dude may have a weak flow but his beats are sick and his work ethic is respectable!!! The man can dress and he's the reason Jay-Z went from Good Rapper to Rap ICON!!! Kanye is holding a whole city down all by himself!!! Common and Twista are the only two other rappers that are making any mainstream noise from Chicago and both of their cd's were executive produced by Kanye!!! The only other rapper able to hold down a whole city by himself is Eminem and Eminem Is a Living Legend easily one of the top 5 greatest mc's!!! Kanye brush then haters off boy, do ya thing fam!!! <br />
B00005JMEW|5.0|A fun movie, with lots of action. If you are a fan of these kinds of films, you wont be dissapointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is even better than Battlestar (which is saying something). Even my wife loves this wonderful series. How could Fox bin it? Name the person who signed the cancellation order - fire them, quick! Before they do more damage. Better still, hand them over to the Alliance to mess around with their brain (if they've got one). Come on, admit you were wrong and commission a second series - please. <br /> <br />PS. I'm only a recent convert (thanks to the feature film).
B00006RINF|5.0|When my freind first told me about this band, I was shy a bit but later found out that this album is esstinal to any rocker's collection. Pure cool. Get this?!
B0000004F9|2.0|The unlistenable CD prompts this review.The music is great,be assured of that.It is ingeniously inventive and highly imgainative lyrically while fully satisfying musicianship engages you with deft skill producing truely fun , pleasant and enjoyable aural fruit that's why i bought it but within seconds i was hearing distortion not associated with the playing,it was a poor CD mastering job  in my opinion then the skips.....skips,skips and more skips.Little one second dead spots.Enough to get blood pressure up.The disc is going back but i won't be buying another from this label.I'll take Vol.Three from Sony in exchange thank you.Great music of course right?Don't hesitate to buy the separate original recordings remastered if you like intelligent fun.A study of that phenomenon referred to as Dada said to influence these blokes could benefit in getting underneath the  the psychology of the music.Whatever its real nature or influence the track on Volume 2 titled;Dada was here is  a beautifully refreshing piece sung entirely in Spanish and if that embodies any aspect of this 'movement' it gets my hearty applause as it really conveys a whimsical elegance that lends a deep satisfaction to  ones contemplation of life. Enjoy..........
B00000099Y|5.0|Definately one of Tool's best.  Between the sick guitar chords and Maynard's vocal talent and lyrical genius, this album is definately a must have for anyone who appreciates this band.  Not for the faint of heart or those who think music will encourage suicide in children,  like the guy who reviewed the album on 20 Feb 06.
0321344758|3.0|Yes this book is quick and easy to read but it could have been condensed to 1/3 of its size if it dispensed with the chatty talk that added no value.  I expected more \\"meat\\". <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the section on user-testing because it echoed my experience. Having it echoed in a book gives it validation to show to clients. <br /> <br />I think this book is way overrated.  It is practical common sense and the target audience is for management and marketers who don't have any practical experience in this area.
B000001E18|5.0|This is one of the most alternative records from U2, with a real noise guitar and the spectacular voice of the band leader Bono. <br /> <br />It's a must in every CD Collection.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|This one was not as good as the original and I think Johnny Depp should stick to what he is good at.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|While \\"The Constant Gardener\\" lacked the impact of director Fernando Meirelles' haunting classic \\"City of God\\" it was nonetheless a noteworthy tale of intrigue based on the John Le Carre novel.  Excellent cinemaography filmed in large part in both Kenya and Sudan made a stunning panorama of both the beauty and horrors of the African continent.<br /><br />Urbane, genteel English diplomat Justin Quayle played by the versatile Ralph Fiennes falls deeply in love with political activist Tessa played by Rachel Weisz.  They marry and go off to his posting in Africa.  The chemistry between Fiennes and Weisz is unmistakable even though their personalities are at different ends of the spectrum.<br /><br />In flashback sequences which at times are hard to follow, we learn that Weisz has been murdered amid rumours of infidelity.  She apparently had uncovered a scam perpetrated by a huge pharmaceutical firm which was test marketing a revolutionary TB drug in Kenya.  She and her colleague, a black African doctor Arnold Bluhm played by Hubert Kounde discovered that poor unfortunate denizens of the slums of Kenya were being used as guinea pigs.  Apparently the firm was covering up the lethal side effects of the medication in order to avoid having to go back to the lab and spend millions more in research.  Both Weisz and Kounde were killed for their troubles.<br /><br />The normally mild mannered introverted Fiennes goes on a personal inquisition to find out what truly happened to his wife . Under threats from members of the British government and high ranking officials from the drug firm, Fiennes struggles to continue his dead wife's quest.  Threatened with great personal danger he is lead to a doctor working in the bush, Lorbeer played by Pete Postlethwaite who reveals the mechanism of the coverup.  All the while he is being pursued so that he can also be silenced.
B00006LI4S|4.0|Very nice DVD, the only problem is the cost (too much taxes paid in Italy)...
0307276902|5.0|Regardless of the exaggerated stories brought to light on Oprah, you cannot make up the feelings expressed in this story. I am a recovering person. I have felt James' story to my core. Although I am also a devoted AA member, I honor his right to choose whatever works for him. I would recommend this book to all recovering people and their families.
0743454537|5.0|The package arrived timely and in excellent condition. Great book to read also.
B000000OF6|5.0|This is yet by far the best culmination of greatest hits on a double CD set.  POP the top on your convertible and go!
630460291X|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. I love Science Fiction and Fantasy. And the movie has so many great stars in it. Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman to just name a few. And it is a great story line. I'm a sucker for happy endings. And this movie had everything, action, adventure, drama, romance and all with a happy ending. I just loved it!
0743454537|5.0|I purchased this book as a book club selection without having heard of it.  However, I now recommend this to all of my friends who are looking for a great read.  This book addresses head on a topic that is so horrific to think of that many of us choose not to. The characters are so vibrant that one minute you sympathize with them and the next you think they are terrible people.  Upon finishing this book, you will just sit there for several minutes with your jaw hanging open. This is a must read!
6305558167|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. If you love Science Fiction and Fantasy, you should love this movie. This movie did not have stars that were familiar to me, but they did an excellent job. Especially Nigel Terry as Merlin. Wonderful performance. It is the story of King Arthur with a few new twists that really grabbed my interest. This movie had everything. Action, adventure, drama, intrigue and romance. I just loved it!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|When I first heard about the series, I was like everyone else...fire what??!!  But I was bored one night and went to rent a movie.  I ended up renting Serenity and the movie was a lot of fun.  A lot better than I thought it would be.  So I was curious and ended up buying the series and I don't regret my impulse buy one bit.  This series had everything a cool sci-fi should have action, comedy and more action.  It's cool mix of sci fi and western.  Too bad it only last a season.
1573301183|5.0|This is a moving performance by a severely underrated band. I didn't really start to appreciate AIC until the last few years. This is a great bare bones performance of AIC playing their most important songs. This is a testament to the bands incredible power.   <br />The crowning point of this video for me was the performance of \\"Down in a Hole\\". This is a very intense song that seems to eulogize the life of Lane Staley.  <br />If you are like me you will find this video so enjoyable to watch that you will likely watch it often. This video will change the way you look at everything.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I love love love this movie Jamie Fox and Tom Curse were great at first I thought the pairing was wrong but thay rocked if anyone has'nt saw it rent it it's worth the money.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My step-dad is a fan of this series, but I never got around to watching it until after I'd already seen the movie and was at my parent's place for Christmas. The movie is very well done in that you don't have to already be familiar with the series in order to appreciate the movie. Having said that, after watching the series, both are absolutely wonderful. My husband and I were glued to the t.v. for all of the DVDs.  Rarely have I ever seen a series that is so immediately engaging. I love how both drama and humor are used so effectively.  The character development is incredible, and it is so easy to be drawn into caring for and knowing each character. I am so angry with Fox for never giving this story the chance it deserved (especially considering how actively Fox promotes so many other shows that are absolute dreck).  <br /> <br />This series is one of the best-told stories I've ever seen and I'm so sad that this looks to be all of it. I wish there would be more, but I'm happy that we get to have even this small amount of it.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Wonderful edition with a special casket  in metal...!!    beautiful extras,specially  the documentary \\"RKO Production 601\\" , that celebrate this miliary stone of the cinematography..!!
B0001L3MI0|5.0|great action/adventure movie. aliens galore. for all but the youngest of viewers...language not for little ones.
B000022TSH|5.0|Many people feel that \\"Chinatown\\" put Roman Polanski on the map as a directorial force to be reckoned with.  I feel that honor went to \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" six years earlier in 1968 and \\"Chinatown\\" solidified his force.<br /><br />In any case, the movie's plot has been described numerous times on this page (and those folks can do a bit more justice to it than I) but a potential viewer needs to watch the movie to get the full force of Jack Nicholson's incredible acting, Faye Dunaway's conniving character, even Polanski's cameo as a wise-cracking gangster who cuts up Nicholson's nose pretty good.<br /><br />And I'm usually not into DVD extras (interviews detailing every technical and creative aspect of the movie) but I was curious to know more about this masterpiece and was not disappointed in the least.  (Although, I admit, I became very uncomfortable watching Roman become uneasy mentioning Sharon Tate's name.  I wish he never had to go through that.)<br /><br />An interesting fact was mentioned by scriptwriter Robert Towne and that is that the movie never takes place in Chinatown.  It has nothing to do with Chinatown (just plenty of deception).<br /><br />Watching \\"Chinatown\\" is two hours well invested.
B000A0GP4K|3.0|A very welldone study of an American music icon.  It showed why he had a fallingout with the folk \\"establishment\\".  The performance segments are a true treasure for any music lover.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This album is terrific.  It really showcases all of the Elvis classics that we all know.  I purchased it for Christmas for my husband and as a family we listen to it constantly and enjoy each and every one of the selections.  We liked it so much we bought one for my inlaws for their birthdays as well.  They are also really loving it.
0307276902|5.0|This book was one of the most compelling, riveting books I have ever read in my life.  I found myself stealing away any moments I could to read on and on.  The fact that certain details were embellished upon does not change my opinion one iota.  Negativity directed at these details is just MISSING THE POINT! James Frey has a true gift as a novelist, and I feel that taking away attention from the message he so beautifully delivered is an absolute shame.  He has clearly painted the ugly life of addiction.  Take it and learn from it.
B0001L3MI0|2.0|It is still amazing to me that this film was the top grossing movie of 1996, followed by \\"Twister\\", which in many ways was equally cheesy. I remember seeing the ads for this movie before it was released, and even a well-polished advertising campaign could not hide the schlockiness of it all.<br />The dialogue is completely forgettable, the plot is thin and obvious, and even if you CAN suspend your beliefs and assume that an Apple laptop computer can do all of the stunts that Jeff Goldblum's character's computer can do and that a cropduster suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (Randy Quaid) can learn how to fly late 20th century state-of-the-art military planes basically by instinct, there is one final piece of posturing that is too much to take. NEVER would the President of the United States both endanger himself and allow himself to become a spectacle by putting on a flight suit and piloting a plane in a time of war ... Oh, yeah, I almost forgot about that incident 3 years ago...oops...my bad.<br />The reason I am even giving this film two stars is for one, the special effects are impressive in a movie that has precious little else going for it. Secondly, and most of all, the only thing that makes this movie remotely watchable is Will Smith. Even with what the writers/directors give him to work with he steals the show. Plus, the \\"buddy\\" thing he has going with Jeff Goldblum's character when they go to deliver the computer virus to the alien spacecraft comes off well. I'm just glad that Will Smith got to showcase what he is really capable of the following year when he starred in a quality film about alien life on earth, \\"Men in Black\\".
0060899190|1.0|I felt this book was a waste of my money.  I would not recommend this book.

0307276902|2.0|My book club had previously chosen this book because of its purported authenticity.  Reading it just after the author had been exposed for promoting a work of fiction as nonfiction, I felt cheated as I constantly wondered what was true and what was fabricated in the story.  Having a dear friend who is a recovering \\"gutter drunk,\\" I think that Frey's descriptions of his life prior to being put on the plane may not be too exagerated.  I only wish for a truer account of the rehab process.  Something about the writing, though - perhaps the \\"teaser\\" references to what happened to Her - kept me reading. <br /> <br />The author's writing style caused me difficulty in following conversations, as he uses no quotations. Periods at the end of sentences are almost the only punctuation marks employed. He either relies on two and three word sentences or an overabundance of run-on sentences linked with \\"and.\\"  I suppose that this style is in keeping with the drugged-out character, although he is supposed to be of \\"above average intelligence.\\"  Profanity runs rampant, but then, this lends to the authenticity of the culture.   <br /> <br />The book has some merit for its insight into the mind of an addict, but ethics call for it to be promoted as fiction that is loosely based on truth. <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|The layering is incredible. I love the \\"slide\\" from song track 7 - \\"Forbidden Love\\" to song track 8 - \\"Jump\\" with the underlying track.  Very nice. In addition, to compare these works to, \\"80's\\" or \\"disco\\",as mentioned in prior reviews, I believe to be a little too mundane.  Especially since the tonality on a whole hits levels of chakra balancing. Madonna hit notes I've never heard her sing before...it's definitely the lady in her higher self for true Madonna fans.
0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist generated more discussion at my book club than any other book we've read in a very long time.  I recommend it to everyone who allows themselves to reflect on the meaning and potential of our lives. The only people who would not benefit from reading this are those who call themselves \\"realists,\\" although I call them cynics.   <br /> <br />Coelho masterfully guides us through exploring our \\"legend.\\"  What is it that each of us is meant to be?  What is it that fulfils our life?  We start our conscious life with dreams and aspirations.  While most of us abandon our legend when we are young, Coelho urges us to hold on and follow it.   <br /> <br />While The Alchemist should be read by people young enough to still believe in their legends, I fear that it is read more by those of us who can only reminisce and try to grasp at remnants.  My hope is that those who have not forgotten their legends, will read this and be inspired.    <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|4.0|This ALBUM is goLden...hopefully it went Platnium! But besides that Mariah is back at it again with her TALENTED,UNiQUE and Soft voice that nobody else can mimmick or even dont reckon!  <br /> <br />==Tasha==
B0007PAMR4|4.0|I'm a big fan of Frank Herbert's Saga of Dune, and in my opinion, David Lynch's Dune is good for the performances for the actors, with the exception of Sting as Fade.  The look of the flim doesn't present anything new of interesting that wasn't already seen in George Lucas's \\"Star Wars\\" a few years earlier.  The story telling is ok for about two-thirds of the way through the movie ( in both versions), but the skip so much in the third-part of the story which really messes everything up. I didn't like the ending to the extended cut, but I thought the one for the theatrical cut was more interesting with Paul seeing his homeworld, and making it rain on arrakis at the end of the movie.  Despite the flaws, I thought David Lynch's Dune was pretty good.

I have ordered it twice from amazon and both copies have a \\"freeze\\" during the Netherfield Ball segment. I have returned both those copies and am hoping to order it again later and get one where this problem is fixed.

B00011F5DK|5.0|Everyone in my family from our 3 yr old, 5 yr old, 8 yr old and 9 yr old, to my husband enjoys playing this game together.  It's simple enough that even the 3 yr old understands how to do it and feels included, but the strategy and challenge is great for the older ones to stay interested.  Wonderful game for the family!  Whenever we say \\"let's play a game,\\" this is the one everyone reaches for time and again.
006054094X|4.0|I will preface this review with the caveat that I have spent some time, in the recent past, researching Pre-Columibian visits to the Western Hemisphere. This is a facinating topic that will change the course of our understanding of Ancient man when the data is presented to people, like in this book.<br /><br />The author relies on his experience as a Navigator in the British Navy to help him piece together data from a number of Eastern historical documents and artifacts that point to a Chinese Expidition reaching the Americas around 1421 - 1422.<br /><br />An interesting read, not too deep, not too shallow. Some of the facts stated don't have the depth of collaboration that would make then iron clad.<br /><br />Recommended to historical researchers interested in the topic.
B00011RPB0|1.0|This DVD opens with about 5 minutes of commercials which cannot be skipped; although you can fast-forward, this still takes time. This movie grossed 44.5 million at the box office (USA alone, on a budget of 4 million), the DVD retails at $15, yet the corporate honchos are so greedy that they have to include DVD commercials even when people are buying the DVD. The movie is mildly entertaining, but not worth seeing more than once. I recommend checking it out from your local library.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|I recommend it to anyone interested in the Bay Area music scene in the 1960's.  'She has funny cars' is a classic!  They never mention anything about funny cars.  I have no idea what they are talking about but it's a great song.  'Today' is another great song and it draws you into that 60's time-capsule type of feeling.
B0009F9O6M|5.0|To think this music was originally recorded more than thirty-five years ago is amazing, considering the punch and vitality it still contains in this new century. VDGG has always been totally unique.  Peter Hammill's vision, leading this fine band of musicians to places other bands fear to tread has always been an adventurous and rewarding listening experience. I'll admit, initially it might take a little getting used to for some people. These guys are different, but boy is it worth getting into! H to He contains some of the band's best work. There are moments of straight ahead rock (Killer), achingly beautiful laments (House With no Door) and cool spacey rock (Pioneers Over C). The remastering job sounds great. Get it!

4789009637|5.0|I had been using Japanese for Busy People when I found out about this series, and decided to give it a try. Basically, it's great, even for self-study, and as someone else already put it, it never withholds information, and it's very fast paced: hiragana and katakana in 2 lessons, and kanji from lesson 3 and on...consider getting the textbook along with the workbook, answer key and the 6-cd pack. I couldn't find it in the u.s. though, so I bought it from amazon.co.jp - a lot cheaper, even with s&h. Also check [...] for more info.
6304696566|4.0|I I thoroughly enjoy watching this movie from time to time. I thought John Wayne's acting was better in this movie than some of his other movies.  The scenery was great. I highly recommend this movie.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|When I first heard from this I never really thought about it that much. At the time it felt like the cheap slasher flicks in the modern days have brought the horror genre to an end, losing its true meaning. Still there was something about the movie saying, 'I could be wrong' - and without a doubt, I was. Session 9 is one of those films that show that blood and gore is not required to bring horror to its finest. It's a film that relies strictly on psychological horror to make its point.<br /><br />The film contains an all male cast who gives great performances throughout, who are brought together as a team to work on an abandoned insane asylum, in preparation for renovation.<br /><br />Session 9 doesn't exactly have truly terrifying scenes. Instead, within the asylum, it contains the elements of fear and paranoia with a great deal of atmosphere within the structure, of its actual existence, and realism excluding the effect of darkness. With extremely limited violence and no special effects-(the one thing horror does not need whatsoever), which is all the more reason to see it.<br /><br />The greatest thing about Session 9 is how the horror isn't clearly thrown in your face, but drags you through certain events, characters backgrounds and motifs, and creepy voice sessions, letting the horror build slowly but surely, allowing you to think for yourself, bringing it to the conclusion that is original and rock solid.<br /><br />Session 9 is the rebirth of the horror genre.

0345479092|5.0|I highly recommend this book to any parent of a newborn.  Since he was my first I had no idea how to get him into a routine.  After hearing a few people rave about it, I bought the book  when my son was about 6 weeks old & after following E.A.S.Y. he was sleeping through the night at 12 weeks old.  I could easily distinguish his cries & could tell when he was tired and needed to sleep.
B00005JKDR|5.0|It doesn't get better than this!  We purchased this copy as a replacement for one that we borrowed a couple of years ago.  Fun for parents as well as kids.  Added bonus - the more you watch (which you will), the more funnies the parents will pick up on.  Do not miss out!
B000B8QEYC|2.0|I've been an admirer and observer of Enya since before the \\"Orinoco\\" began to \\"Flow,\\" if that means anything. Astute observers of Enya's artistry have noted subtle growths and delightful (though often subtle) developments in her arrangements, her orchestral vision, and her exploration of the melodic landscape over the years--these are developments that only true admirers of Enya would appreciate; the rest of the world would lift their noses high and write-her-off as a New Age Muzak \\"cash-machine\\" on autopilot. This is unfair: Enya HAS grown, and admirably so. However, it is long past the time when she should amicably part ways with her lyricist, Roma Ryan. <br /> <br />    I thoroughly admire Enya's loyalty in \\"sticking with\\" Ryan over the long years. Yet, on this album (as on no other) the glaring deficiencies of Ryan's lyricism are never more apparent. It is one thing to suggest that Ryan develop her lyrical skills as craftily as Enya has developed her compositional skills, but it is quite another to put up with lyrics that, ultimately, negate the true potential of Enya as one of the most viable and necessary artists of our time. The arrangements on 'Amarantine' are probably the best of Enya's formidable catalogue, for the listener who has followed her and managed to catch the nuances of her perfect exploration of new chord changes and melodic sleights-of-hand. Sadly, Ryan's lyrics reach new lows on this otherwise admirable offering. Enya fans are NOT 12 year-olds capable of appreciating only the most trite of weatherbeaten cliches. They are generally sophisticated and appreciative souls, who respond to both melody and to lyric. Ryan is taking Enya's lush new arrangements and throwing the most brain-curdling hodgepodge of nonsense against them, and it's a shame. Simplicity of lyric is one matter, and can be powerful, but insipid claptrap is quite another. A lyric, however simple, has to make some sort of sense. There are basic rules about syntax and \\"form\\" that do not overwhelm \\"function\\" to the point of insulting a listener. <br /> <br />    There are so many \\"sunny days\\" rhymed with \\"go aways,\\" not to mention \\"silver linings\\" and \\"love is love is love\\" bits that one is hard-pressed to wonder why Enya sticks with a lyricist that is horrifically not up to any particular sonic challenge. For example (just ONE!), Enya is made to sing that she doesn't \\"know why your broken dreams make you fly.\\" BECAUSE THEY'RE BROKEN. Hello? If the lyrics were written to make any kind of sense to anyone with even a THINKING adolescent mind, these kinds of \\"throw-a-bunch-of-rhyming-words-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks\\" approaches would be apparent. They SHOULD be apparent. Worse yet is Ryan's laughable attempt to \\"create\\" a new \\"language\\" on several of the tracks. Whoah! Now, it is no secret that Enya is a great admirer of Tolkien's astonishing achievement in actually \\"creating\\" a viable new \\"language\\" for the characters in his Lord of the Rings trilogy. Enya has reflected this admiration to powerful effect in previous work. But Tolkien was a brilliant and disciplined Oxford linguist who knew how to create a \\"language\\" based upon the foundational platforms of syntax, consistency, and even cadence. Roma Ryan is not a masterfully-trained linguist. She is BARELY a lyricist, at this stage. Her \\"language\\" is transparently a lot of garden-variety \\"jibber-jabber.\\" Gobbledy-gook. I expect that any American pentecostal congregation, on any given Sunday, could come-up with \\"languages\\" more coherent whilst \\"speaking in tongues\\" than Ryan could ever muster.  <br /> <br />    It's a crying shame, because Enya's arrangements on this record, in my opinion, have never been better, and her voice has matured to new levels of character and nuance. Honestly, I would have preferred to simply hear this album without lyrics and without voice, but only because that pristine voice was doomed to sing the lyrics that were apparently culled from Roma Ryan's morning cereal box, or perhaps a selection of the past year's greeting cards she had been hoarding for the project. <br /> <br />   Quite honestly, I adore Enya and her singular talent. On this album, her compositions are as stellar (if not more) than ever before. Every song on this record, though, is marred by \\"poetry\\" that would probably not pass muster in an elementary class for 10 year-olds. EVERY song. That's what stunned me, and that's not to mention Ryan's attempt at \\"creating\\" a new \\"language.\\" If it weren't for Ryan's contribution, I would give this album 10 shining stars for Enya -- one of the best and most vital composers of our time (despite the naysayers). But, the naysayers only gain more ground on Enya when she continues to employ Ryan as a lyricist. The working relationship is past the point of being productive and has fallen down a hill into a ditch. Please, Enya, no one expects you to find a lyricist that composes unbelievably complex insights into the human soul. Someone who could write like a sentient adult and make sense would be JUST FINE. Simplicity with sense is glorious. Simplicity without sense is...well, Ryan's lyrics on 'Amarantine.'  <br /> <br />    Enya has ALL of the other bases covered. There's a reason why Enya is not (yet) on the Irish Music Wall of Fame in Dublin along with U2, Christy Moore, Mary Black, Sinead O'Connor and other legends...it's Roma Ryan. Enya herself deserves to be the top of that list (because she is just as artistically gifted and even BIGGER commercially). Let's hope she careens into a new songwriting partnership more deserving of her singular brilliance on the next album. Sorry, gang, but I love Enya's artistry, and I have to call it as I see it--currently speaking.

B000AP04OM|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. When it first came out I saw it  seven times- and that was in a theater- before videos. I actually bought this copy for my mom- who loves the movie too and used to sing all the songs to us in the car. I have my own copy and I love it. The interview with Maria Von Trapp is a nice addition. I love this movie!
0142000663|3.0|I completely appreciate this novel for its historical context and realism. However it is very long and every other chapter consists of overly detailed events, such as a turtle crossing the road. It's hard to get through, but anyone that must read it will at least understand why. You may never want to read it again, although I just might someday pick it up and read it for a second time. You'll never forget the ending for as long as you live. Very well written.
B00005O5CM|4.0|this movie is fun, animated, interesting, cute and NOT just a chick flick!  i think Reese Witherspoon is an exceptional actress and this movie just proves that she can also do comedy very very well.  i think you'll really like it!

We had to fight the tears that flowed to get through the book. <br />You'll just have to read it to find out for yourself what a wonderful book this is.
B000001E18|4.0|This CD does not stand alone, but, at least in my mind, goes along with Wim Wenders film \\"Faraway, So Close!\\" The subtitle of \\"Stay\\" is the name of the film! The album is excellent and contains a number of the \\"B-sides\\" on the best of album.

0440419514|2.0|I was intrigued by His Dark Materials, which I'd heard touted as something of an anti-Narnia. Packed with talking animal companions, witches, armored polar bears, ghosts, shamans, soul-sucking spectres, zeppelins and hot air balloons, angels, cliff-ghasts, harpies, miniature dragonfly-riding warriors, magic spells, weird science, literary references, alternate timelines, malevolent conspiracies, intrigue, ancient emnities, multiverse-spanning wars, and a knife that can cut between worlds, His Dark Materials has all the trappings of an allegorical sci-fi/fantasy epic, with one crucial, conspicuous exception: It is almost utterly devoid of charm. I prefer Narnia.

0679422714|4.0|From this book there is much to learn, not only about Mao, but his associates, and also the people of China, who were innocent victims.  Also I get the sense of actually being there, learning the geographics and history of China in the early 20th century, and the peoples suffering because of this most evil being. It is well documented and interviews with real survivors bring light to this sad time.
B00002DEGZ|5.0|It's not that Bilson is the world's greatest (forte-) pianist, although he's very, very good. (He's better as a performer than as a composer--he uses his own cadenzas where better ones, such as Beethoven's in #20, are commonly played.) It's not that two centuries of developing the modern piano were wasted effort, and the fortepiano sounds best after all.  It's not that history trumps musicality.  What makes these recordings great is that an appropriate balance between soloist and orchestra is restored.   <br /> <br />Anyone with a sense of musical proportion, who listens carefully to recordings of piano concertos, can tell that the piano is often in the foreground when it belongs in the background, and backup from other instruments is often nearly inaudible. Of course this is especially true of the earlier concertos (Bach, Haydn, Mozart), which were scored and written based on the feeble solo instruments of the time.  <br /> <br />Here, Archiv's restraint in miking/mixing, on top of the severe limitations of the fortepiano, greatly shifts the balance of power back towards the orchestra.  This is not invariably an improvement, but most of the time it restores proper proportion to Mozart's music, with outstanding results. Often it adds drama, because instead of floating above the orchestral fray, the soloist must play very forcefully to address the competing sound of the orchestra. Perhaps the orchestra plays with a bit more conviction knowing they're not just going to be overrun by a Steinway the size of an Amtrak. <br /> <br />As Bilson was literally the first to admit (in the original CD notes), the fortepianos he plays cannot deliver the long legato line that pianists use to great effect in the slow movements.  So there is much to be said for hearing these works on the modern piano. But Bilson and Gardiner take the bull by the horns, pick up the tempo as needed, and make the slow movements convincing on their own terms.  <br /> <br />I got the full-priced editionyears ago, and greatly enjoy going back and forth between it and modern-piano versions.  Highly, though not exclusively, recommended.
0385513755|5.0|Lovely! The graphics are beautiful. Reads almost like a reference book. Get one while you can! The story, of course, is complete fiction...<br /><br />I wish they would re-issue masterpieces in this kind of format. That would prove very useful for casual literature scholars.
B00004TJTS|4.0|I first saw My Dog Skip on TV a few yars ago. Or rather the last 45 minutes or so. My impression was of a kind of cute, entertaining dog movie for kids. But I wasn't prepared for the last 5 or so minutes dealing with Willy's transition to young adulthood, his farewell to his family and Skip, and especially the aging and death of Skip. Normally I'm pretty cynical about emotional manipulation in a film but the ending had me in tears. And I had only 45 minutes to get any attachment to Skip, not the 80 that was meant in the full film. Of course I tried not to cry to save myself some embarrasment, trying to act like I wans't moved, but the ending is so well done that I think anyone would be moved. The gentle, haunting music, melancholy voice over and clever use of camera zoom and pan all create to deilver a poweful emotional punch. It might sound silly on paper- boy gets dog, boy and dog have advetures, dog dies, audience bawl like babies. But on screen it works.    Most of us have owned a dog at some point and can recall the pain and loss when the pet dies. Or any pet for that matter. But Skips passing could perhaps symbolise any death. Even if you've never ownwd a dog or (perish the thought) don't like dogs, the passing of such a symbol of innocence and unconditional love must surely have some emotional impact. And perhaps it symobolised the death of Willy Morris' own childhood. When Skip died perhaps thst marked the true end of his boyhood (I've never read the book)    The film does have a few flaws. It sesm less a seamless story than a fairly disjointed colection of episodes. And the author seems to think that Skip helped him to make the bullies his peers. I couldn't really see that, unless he was talking about the scene in the graveyard where perhaps the presence of Skip gives him courage to stay the night. And since the author admits that his town was a place where nothing much happened, there doesn't seem to be all that much hapening around there!  There mainly seems to be Willy's battle with shyness, and liking Skip more as the film progresses. I would have liked to have seen more made of the segregation issue, or the character of the local hero turned disgraced soldier explored more.    In fact I'm not even sure if My Dog Skip is appropriate for small children. Some appreciate a tug on the heart strings, but others might not. My Dog Skip is designed to appeal to your emotions, but the differecne is that most *want* to experience a bit of heartbreak, knowing that it isn't actually real. Small children will surely cry by the end of the film, but may not realise that's exaclty what the makers intended, and may jsut end up being upset. So I would advise a bit of parental guidance on this one.
B00009XITQ|1.0|This movie was so contrived on so many levels. I've seen better acting in puppet shows, although to be fair, it was definitely \\"cute\\". I wish that were enough to make it worthwhile.
B000BTDMDC|3.0|I've been following the hubbub surrounding the Arctic Monkeys and I finally got a chance to listen to the album...and I must say, I'm baffled as to why there's so much hype.  This album is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it's instead very middle-of-the-road.  It has a few good songs, but it's a mostly harmless, derivative mash-up of Franz Ferdinand, the Libertines and the Strokes.  NME named this the 5th greatest British album ever, by the way.  Above both the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" and Radiohead's \\"OK Computer.\\"  That should give you an idea of how out of control the Arctic Monkeys' hype machine has gotten. <br /> <br />A decent album, but not life-changing like some would have you believe.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing! I watched it as a kid growing up and purchased it again, at the age of 22, to see how I would feel about it now. I love it even more!!!  Everyone should see this movie at least once. What a great twist on an old classic!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Initially, I really liked Serenity.  I understood why the emotional events near the end were necessary, and I even approved in a way.  Then time passed, and I began to think about this being the end of Firefly for all time, and my opinion of the movie changed.  I was disappointed and angry, and felt let down by some of the choices the filmmaker made; he seemed to cave in to marketing pressures in ways he never did during the TV series. <br /> <br />But now that I've had several months to reflect (and watch it on DVD), I've decided that while Serenity has flaws, and is arguably not as good as the series, I'm glad it was made, and I do enjoy watching it (if sometimes only to reminisce about how wonderful the series was). <br /> <br />Since I have seen all the episodes of Firefly, and I'm very familiar with the characters, I am not able to comment on how enjoyable Serenity is as \\"a sci-fi movie\\", but I was impressed with the visual impact of the film, it had some really good lines, and has a plot that holds together at least as well as any other recent sci-fi movie.
B000784WMW|1.0|I bought the first Jane Eyre DVD and when I started watching it I found out it was damanged.    It would freeze in one particular chapter.  I called Amazon and explained the problem and they sent me another movie. The new movie did exactly the same thing.  I called you back again and explained the situation and your representative asked me to shipped them back that they would investigate my complaint.  I have been waiting since then to hear from you regarding this issue.  Have you been able to determine if there is something wrong with that particular movie?  I have a collection of all Jane Austen movies and the only one that I've had problems with has been with that one.  Could you please let me know if you have checked the movies?  I would very much like to purchase another Jane Ayre movie, but I would like to know that the \\"freezing\\" problem has been resolved.

0393035158|5.0|I love Sam Harris, so this is not going to be an unbiased accounting. But he's right about these issues of religion in our culture today, about how our world is being taken to a very dangerous place by fundamentalists on all sides of the issues.  Extreme right wing fundamentalists are no less dangerous to us than Muslim extremists. People that vote blindly because of their faith, against their own self interests have cost us 6 years of absolute horror. I consider George Bush and his pals to be counted among the extremists, and probably more dangerous than the countries they seek to dominate out of greed. All these wars and conflicts today are about two things: money - oil, haves and have nots, and religion. Sam Harris lays it out how this happened, and exactly why it is so dangerous for all of us. <br />Told ya this wasn't balanced.  These are not times for the timid. Speak up.
B000E97Y6K|1.0|This was on of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.  The best part of the movie was when the usher had to kick out some unruly teens.  To think about it they were the smart ones.  They paid $9 to see only half of a crappy movie, I had to pay $9 to sit through a 3 hour snoozer.  The whole s@#& on the island did not need to be in the movie.  DAMN I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!!
B000E1YVZU|1.0|I can't believe I wasted any time watching this movie.  I'm sure all the good reviews are from gays and lesbians, but not to say I am prejudice because I am a huge Rocky Horror Picture Show fan.  I found it to be extremely lame and not very believable.  Nothing that happened in this movie made any sense, and the songs in the movie were terrible because too often, they were very random.  It was also too long and dragged on.  Every minute I had to watch started to seem like a whole hour.  Even my wife who is a huge fan of musicals in general found this film extremely distasteful and horrible.  The fact that this movie is even selling outside of San Francisco is absolutely mind-boggling.  Worst film ever made!  This film was just plain terrible, horrible, etc.  Don't waste your time with this movie!
B0007X6ST2|5.0|I have loved this recording ever since it came out as an import in 1986, and it was a great soundtrack to that summer.  What you get in the remastered version is a louder mix, and a better booklet with more details.  The BIGGEST difference is that 'I burn for you' no longer has a quiet slow fade in and I feel the recording as a whole is longer by 2-3 minutes especially noticeable at the beginning and end of each song.  Still a great listen after all these years.
B0002NRRAG|3.0|I enjoyed this album.  The title cut is the one real winner here.  As a devout Billie Holiday fan, I appreciated the fact that despite Ms. Peyroux's voice being very similar she doesn't really try to imitate.<br /><br />Would recommend to those looking for something soothing and relaxing.

B000002KBU|4.0|Got this along with the \\"Hits\\" because I couldn't decide which one I wanted.  I liked this almost as much as the \\"Hits\\" although \\"Hits\\" has more of the timeless, classic songs.
B0000039QA|5.0|I think because of his \\"thug image\\", and the lyrics and lifestyle his songs embue, many people dismiss him.  But for people who are willing to consider the fact that all types of music (even \\"hard\\" music and lyrics such as this) can be artistic, and who actually listen to this CD with OPEN ears, they will recognize that Biggie was a true artist.  The way he incorporates little things into his songs (like the authentic sounding phone conversations, complete with music sometimes playing in the background) is very clever.  Track # 8 on disc two would have to be my favorite song.  The opening intros are beautiful, and very effective, and the beat in this song is AWESOME.  To me, Biggie is one of the most artistic rappers we've seen to date, if not THE most artistic.
B000035Z1Z|4.0|Not as nice as \\"Innerspace\\" (really a Dennis Quaid or Martin Short vehicle) or \\"When Harry Met Sally,\\" but one of the better Meg Ryan romantic comedies.  Meg Ryan's sweetness balanced by Kevin Kline's vaguely disreputableness. <br /> <br />Loved the scenes with the snooty French hotel concierge.  Jean Reno was also pretty good.
B00023B1A8|2.0|I was fortunate to be able to see a live preformance in my home town about 12 years ago. I don't beleive that this effort is \\"up to par\\".

B000BO0LEU|3.0|Spanish track extremely difficult to hear.  Music muffles dialogue to the point where the characters who are speaking often cannot be heard.  How disappointing in such a wonderful Munsch story!
B0000019PA|5.0|As another reviewer previously noted... In The Aeroplane Over The Sea is a loose concept album, seemingly focusing on the era surrounding World War II, and inspired by the diary of Anne Frank.  It's also a deeply personal and heartfelt album, one that strings together bizarre and often dreamlike lyrics that tend to focus on everything from quarrelling couples to murdered soldiers, with sidelines in funeral processions, executions, genocide and lonely side-show acts.  It's an album that begins with an ode to The King Of Carrot Flowers, takes a trip in an aeroplane high above the sea, traverses through Holland 1945, and eventually climaxes with the last word of a reoccurring character... and the most heartbreaking song about unrequited love ever written. <br /> <br />I only heard the record for the first time in early 2005, but it's already one of my top three albums of all time, with Jeff Mangum's acoustic based tales of woe eventually working their way into my subconscious and grabbing hold of my imagination following numerous late-night listening sessions.  It's an album that demands attention from the listener... not one to be raped and pillaged for the benefit of your iPod, or played in the background during dinner parties for your friends.  You have to work at these songs, picking through the seemingly random stream-of-conscious lyrics, whilst somehow finding yourself entranced by the simple and repetitive strumming and occasional bursts of horns, pianos and other wild instrumental touches like organs, tape effects and singing saws. <br /> <br />The first song, King of Carrot Flowers Pt 1 is the easiest song to like on the first listen, with Mangum tapping into a hazy sense of monochromatic nostalgia, as he intones the opening line \\"when you were young you were the king of carrot flowers, and how you built a tower tumbling through the trees\\".  The rest of the song continues that sense of looking back, with Mangum peppering his lyrics with childlike evocations, as a sweet harmonium counter-melody comes in to jar against the switch into darker lyrical territory, and we start to see the emergence of something much more sinister.  At first, these lyrics seem absolutely random and completely indecipherable, but really, the more we listen to the album, the more we take from it.  Everyone who listens to it will have their own personal interpretations of what Mangum's lyrics might be pointing to... I personally see it as an ode to unrequited love, and that dangerous kind of obsession that Mangum looked at in his post-Aeroplane song \\"Little Birds\\". <br /> <br />The album is perfectly put together, progressing seamlessly from the strummed folk of King of Carrot Flowers Pt 1, into the minimal King of Carrot Flowers Pts 2, which opens with some subtle guitar picking and a minimal burst of organ, with Mangum's trembling shout intoning the refrain \\"I love you Jesus Christ!!\\".  Like much of the album, this earnest statement seems to be inviting ridicule, but, like the idea of yearning for Anne Frank, Mangum means it, and I feel privileged to be able to share in his sense of devotion.  From here, we move into Carrot Flowers Pt 3 (subtitled Up and Over), which is something close to folk-psychedelia, as a bombardment of horns and some quickly strummed guitars enter the fray and the song moves off in a direction that brings to mind the band's first album, the urgent and distorted On Avery Island. <br /> <br />The entire album is a joy to listen to... one that I've been playing constantly since I first got it one that I'd hope to be playing for many more decades to come.  The ideology of the band and the album itself begins to become clearer with songs like In The Aeroplane Over the Sea, and, in particular, Two Headed Boy, in which the album really just becomes a showcase for Mangum and his heavily-strummed acoustic guitar.  As Andy Broder states on the re-issue sleeve, the album works because of the central juxtaposition, \\"lyrically, complexand gruesome... musically, simple and sweetly melodic\\".  The title track builds around four basic verse chords (with some distant background instrumentation adding atmosphere) whilst Mangum and his evocative lyrics capture our imagination.  The same can be said about Two Headed Boy, in which Mangum seems to be envisioning himself as a lost and lonely side-show performer, forced to watch the world go by from the confines of a glass-jar.  It's a beautiful song; like the entirety of the album it's a stark combination of words and music that builds to something truly transcendent. <br /> <br />This album is really too great to put into words... from the Scott Spillane composed orgy of horns and Salvation Army style rhythms that is The Fool, through to the heartbreaking ode to Anne Frank, Holland 1945 (\\"the only girl I ever loved / was born with roses in her eyes / until they buried her alive / one evening 1945 / with just her sister at her side / and only weeks before the guns / all came and rained on everyone\\") and beyond that to the epic free-form ramble of Oh Comely... an eight-minute long character sketch that is probably the closest alternative-folk music ever has come to creating it's own Bohemian Rhapsody/Paranoid Android style moment of transcendence.  I've not even mentioned the ghostly lament of the Communist Daughter, or the surreal, psychedelic instrumental with no name, or the defining moment for me, the gorgeous and heartbreaking Two Headed Boy Pt 2. <br /> <br />Here, Mangum makes himself clear... \\"in my dreams you're alive and you're crying / as your mouth moves in mine soft and sweet / rings of flowers round your eyes and I'll love you / for the rest of your life / in your reading\\".  I'm not guaranteeing that you'll have as intense an experience listening to the album that I have... this record just means something to me... something greater than words could ever express.
0553801503|5.0|I've read all the reviews on this book and had to offer my part. First off, this is an excellent book. Because of its division it was without the storylines of nearly all my favorite characters (Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion), thus it was without the usual number of storyline climaxes, but I found it to nonetheless to be an excellent read, and a good setup covering the lull between the war of the 5 kings and the presumable war with the \\"Others\\". To compare this with the recent problems of the Wheel of time series is ridiculous to say the least. I stopped reading Wheel of time entirely when Jordan bogegd down; Martin's writing, even in this slightly slower book, is in a whole other league.
B000AJJNOK|5.0|Great product.  Easy online shopping.  Alsays low prices!
B00003CX8V|4.0|Billy Wilder was one of the great directors of all time and this is one of his great efforts.  Great performances by Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine and Fred MacMurray as the boss. It is rather dated now but it is still an underappreciated classic.
0316286850|5.0|This is a truly beautiful book.  I'd say that it is a great buy for makeup junkies as well as people who are looking to pick up basic application skills.  It's full of ideas, some simple and pretty, others elaborate and \\"out there\\".  The photography is great, too.  Kevyn Aucoin will always be my favorite makeup artist of all time.
B00000JHAU|2.0|I can see the comparisons I read to Syd Barrett's style, but I found this album sort of monotonous.  It has an appeal to it, but not enough where I would buy the album. <br /> <br />On another note, I was reading the song-by-song 'review' given by another user here where they basically gave the same rating to every song and said almost the same things about every song.  Write a review that's useful!  If you're going to review each song, and you're going to give each song an A then don't EVEN BOTHER WITH IT!
B000096FUD|5.0|There have been many films made that have never been released. There have been many films that started to get made, but that were forced to shut done for one reason or another.  However, until LOST IN LA MANCHA there had never been a film about the unmaking and unraveling of a movie.<br /><br />LOST IN LA MANCHA started out as being a documentary about the making of Terry Gilliam's THE MAN WHO KILLED DON QUIXOTE. Gilliam had been planning a Quixote movie for over a decade and after gaining backing from solely European investors, he finally had secured the funds he needed to make his dream picture. The crew of LOST IN LA MANCHA had planned to make a documentary illustrating the difficulties that occur during the pre-production of a movie.  However, six days into the actual production of the THE MAN WHO KILLED DON QUIXOTE, the film was forced to shut down and this version of Gilliam's dream came to an end.<br /><br />The result is a spellbounding documentary that is humorous, yet tragic.  Reality really can be much more fascinating than fiction.  The filmmakers capture the de-evolution of the film, from the excitement of Gilliam in the early days of pre-production to the confrontations between himself and various crew members to the first day of shooting when fighter jets fly overhead and drop bombs just miles away to an almost epic storm full of rain and hail that washes away an entire set and dramatically changes the very physical appearance of the filmming location to the day that the lead actor is forced to leave the set because of major health problems.  Viewers know from the beginning what is going to happen, but they want to see Gilliam's film made despite the circumstances.<br /><br />LOST IN LA MANCHA is a delightful movie.  It's a film that offers a glimpse into the world of movie-making that often happens, but is rarely experienced by those outside of the business.<br /><br />The DVD version of LOST IN LA MANCHA includes a 2nd disc full of extras. There are interviews with the cast and crew, interviews with Gilliam and Johnny Depp, an interview by Salman Rushdie with Gilliam, and a special IFC interview with Gilliam. Some of this extra material repeats itself, but the stories are so good they are still enjoyable to listen to again and again.here are interviews with the cast and crew, interviews with Gilliam and Johnny Depp, an interview by Salman Rushdie with Gilliam, and a special IFC interview with Gilliam.

B000099T2L|5.0|I absolutley love this cd. I am sorry I didn't buy it sooner. Every song is fabulous!! I highly reccomend it.
0679422714|3.0|The story is well written and interesting.  There is a great deal of factual information that comes from painstaking research and countless interviews.  Mao was, for the most part, a power hungry, ruthless man, with an enormous amount of personal flaws.  This books captures the essence of the man and explodes many myths (even though such myths have slowly disappeared over the years).  Officially, the Chinese still revere the man and myth, but now as an icon.  The only critisism of this book concerns the tendency for the authors to attribute evil intent to every action of Mao described in the book.  He probably did have evil intent, but in a history such as this, a presentation of the facts did not always uncover intent.  The reader could draw his or her own conclusions.
B000002JNJ|5.0|I believe that I am the only one that thinks this album is their best work. The riffs were never better than this, or the lyrics. This is their debut, and the only album the guitars were not tuned down a step and a half, which would be C# tuning. Thats Nu-Metal tuning for those of you who don't know much about guitars, and most Nu-Metal players say that Dime created Nu-Metal with the downtuned groove riffs he played on Vulgar Display and every album after that. Their sound was never faster, or thrashier after this album either. I would pick this album over any of their other offerings because of the speed of the songs, and the fact that it doesnt have that low tuned sound to it. Basically, this is probably every Metallica/Slayer fan's favorite Pantera album. The solos are of course top notch, and the use of bass is creat because behind the scenes, Rex is creating a good atmosphere with his playing. This is one of the best thrash albums ever, and should deffinatly be picked up before any of their other stuff.
0345410025|5.0|I am an eternal student and this book is a gem! Just to give you some background, I am a teacher at a high school as well as a yoga teacher at several different places in my city and I have to memorize many names. In the short time that I have had this book, I have been able to memorize a few hundred names, no problem. Also, just for fun, I memorized the Bill of Rights in about 10 minutes and was able to have an intelligent discussion with our resident AP Goverment teacher on the Bill of Rights. What I will say that after you memorize whatever you have memorized, you need to apply it in any way you can. For instance, I discussed the Bill of Rights right away, and I believe that it will be forever etched in my memory. I also play a game with one of my students about vocabulary words. In about 10 minutes, we both memorized the definitions for words like pugnacious, repugn, zeitgeist, obstreporus and many more. A few days later I quizzed him on them and he still remembered all of them! From a teacher/student to anyone who wants to have a better memory, this is a great book!

B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is one of those rare movies that addresses a controversial subject, managing to hit a nerve with mainstream America, opening discussion and hopefully opening minds.  And who would have thought that the romantic love story of the year would involve a couple of gay cowboys from the director of Sense and Sensibility and The Hulk?<br /><br />The story centers around two men, Ennis Del Mar, played skillfully by Heath Ledger and Jack Twist, played perfectly by Jake Gyllenhaal.  The two young men, both needing jobs for the summer, find work as sheep herders in the mountains of Wyoming.  During that summer of long days and cool nights, the two men forge a friendship.  One night while trying to endure the extreme cold, the two men stay in the same tent and as they, seemingly as surprised as the viewer, begin a sexual relationship, we see the genesis of a life long, yet secret love affair.<br /><br />Once their summer jobs are over, the two men move on with their lives, starting families but eventually they are drawn back to each other.  As often as possible, the two lovers find ways to spend time with each other but denying themselves the chance at a real relationship because of society's attitude toward homosexuality.<br /><br />This film is beautifully adapted from Ann Proulx's short story and is easily the best movie of 2005 (even though the Academy took the cowards route and gave the award to a lesser film).  Thankfully they awarded the award for Best Director to Ang Lee and gave the Oscar for Best Score to Gustavo Santaolalla for his hauntingly beautiful score---it also recieved the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay as well.  Michelle Williams was also brilliant as Alma,  Ennis' long suffering wife who realizes that her husband is in love with his best friend.  The cinematography was incredible as well, like moving paintings of the western landscape.<br /><br />This film is bound to become a classic and will continue to be talked about for years to come.  Love is love, straight or gay, and any film that makes us realize how import love is in our lives, is worth your attention.years to come.  Love is love, straight or gay, and any film that makes us realize how import love is in our lives, is worth your attention.

0307276902|5.0|Regardless to the recent news about A Million Little Pieces, it still stands out as one of my favorite books.<br /><br />James Frey is an amazing writer. Period. At first I was a little dissapointed that the book wasnt 100% true, but then again I highly doubt any memoir is 100% factual. There is no way possible that ANYONE can give exact details of a situation. Every book comes from memory and written down details. Unless an author is writing a book without any sort of pause or break, then it cannot be all acurate.<br /><br />You should really think about, he fooled everyone of us. It was truly ingenius if you ask me.<br /><br />Despite what anyone says, if you have yet to read this book, I highly recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />I loved it enough to buy My Friend Leonard (his second book) and read it in one day. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />You will enjoy this book. See for yourself.

I've heard it said that if you can't recognize a singer's voice after only a few notes he or she won't make it. Well, Mr. Michael Buble is recognizable! And darned good!!  <br />From the first notes of Feeling Good to the last notes of You and I he's 'got you under his skin' for keeps. <br />It's Time is a surefire hit all around.
0141301155|4.0|This book is about a young boy by the name of Charlie who has a very poor family. He lives with his mother, father, and all four of his grandparents. A man named, Willy Wonka, who is the owner of a famous chocolate factory, gave out five golden tickets (hidden in the chocolate bars) to his factory. Charlie finds the last golden ticket and he goes in. All sorts of funny things happen to the four other kids. At the end, he is chosen as the next owner of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.  <br />Two reasons why I loved this book was because it was funny and because it's very fictional. A quote I find funny is said by Willy Wonka. He says, \\"How can you whip cream without whips? Whipped cream isn't whipped cream at all unless it's been whipped with whips. Just as a poached egg isn't a poached egg unless it's been stolen from the woods in the dead of night!\\" A very fictional part of the story is when one of Charlie's grandfather, Grandpa Joe. Grandpa Joe says, \\"Mr Willy Wonka can make marshmallows that taste of violets, and rich caramels that change colour every ten seconds as you suck them, and little feathery sweets that melt away deliciously the moment you put them between your lips. He can make chewing-gum that never loses its taste, and sugar balloons that you can blow up to enormous sizes before you pop them with a pin and gobble them up. And, by a most secret method, he can make lovely blue birds' eggs with black spots on them, and when you put one of these in your mouth, it gradually gets smaller and smaller until suddenly there is nothing left except a tiny little dark red sugary baby bird sitting on the tip of your tongue.\\"  <br />My favorite part of the book is when the fat boy named, Augustus Gloop, gets stuck in a tube. He was drinking out of the chocolate river and he fell into it. Then, there was a tube that sucked him in and since he was fat, he couldn't fit until the tube finally sucked him through. My least favorite part was when a spoiled little girl called, Veruca Salt kept asking her father for everything she wanted. <br />

B000002UAI|5.0|The weary faces of the cover portrait (and the album itself) reveal a leavening of the \\"four jolly lads from Liverpool\\"  that the Beatles had been up to early 1965.  Their writing and recording schedule while still touring is amazing considering the quality of the work and the increasing frenzy of Beatlemania.  Beatles for Sale is an album by a band getting its own voice.  It's still the Cavern Club shouters (Kansas City, Rock 'n Roll Music, Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby), but with more original numbers conveying darker themes from John Lennon (No Reply, Baby's in Black), and a growing melodic sophistication and lyrical beauty from Paul McCartney (I'll Follow the Sun, What You're Doing).  Their pop sensibilities are becoming more refined (Eight Days a Week, Every Little Thing), and there is almost a joyous farewell to the country/rockabilly influences of Carl Perkins, Little Richard, Buddy Holly, and Chuck Berry.  Honey Don't (with George's superb guitar work, notable throughout the album), may be Ringo's swingin'est vocal ever.  George actually gets the final word with his tongue-in-cheek version of Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby--probably as good a statement about Beatlemania ever made, and spoken by the group itself.  This record is exciting for its energy, its lively spirit, and the tension preceding the explosively creative period between Help! and Magical Mystery Tour.  This is a remarkable album.  It was remarkable when it came out, and knowing the history of what came after, it is a gem from the mine of Beatles history.
076780421X|4.0|I have always been a fan of Matthew Perry, enjoying his great comedic timing.  But Fools Rush In has always been a favorite of mine because it displays his tender side as well.   <br />Alex (played by Matthew Perry) meets Isabel (Salma Hayek) and have a one night stand.  She disappears but returns 3 months later to announce that she is pregnant with his child.  What transcends from here on end is an over-night wedding and a marriage which puts to the test their individual heritage.  The challenges are many, but they each attempt to rise to the occasion as Isabel nears the birth of their child. <br />I would especially recommend this to any couple who come from different backgrounds.  It will touch your heart.
B000E1155E|2.0|The British music press - which I've been reading for thirty years, on and off - grows increasingly discredited. Their championing of any group with an attitude, irrespective of the group's actual talent, is becoming pathetic - and a disgrace to the memory of the groups they dare invoke in their comparisons. This particular bunch of Northerners, with their sneering vocals and tales of drinking and clubbing, are being compared to Oasis, Franz Ferdinand, and even the Beatles. But even the worst of that trio - Oasis (by far) - occasionally wrote and recorded a tune or two. There isn't a single track on this album that's memorable for anything other than the words. That's not good enough. The Artic Monkey's front man said it best himself: \\"Don't believe the hype\\".
B000E1YVZU|3.0|Many of us \\"Rent\\" fans have complained about the missing songs, However they were cut and are not missing. I want the edition with these songs restored to there former glory and correct position from the play. Don't get me wrong, I love that they made the movie at all but I wanted to see the play kept intact. <br />The movie never really gave me the chills that the play did. I also feel that they skimped on the extras, Rent has such an interesting history that was not shared.
0143036556|2.0|This book starts off on a very biased footing, with an micro study of the author's favorite ranch, why he liked it, and what it represents (who cares!). He goes to the riduculous exercise of comparing it to other major world sites. If you survive this initial drag, you will be bored by very specific details about certain civilizations, only to arrive to the same conclusion...the weather did it!
B00003CXA6|5.0|I have a little problem with Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee.  But, then, he's alays been an overactor. His crazed expressions make Lee seem to be a lunatic rather than the military geniius he was.  Berenger and Daniels gave fantastic performances.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|This documentary is really LONG, but it is more than WORTH watching. Why? Because it tells us a lot about Bob Dylan, or at least as much as Dylan himself is prepared to say for now.<br /><br /> \\"Part One\\" of \\"No direction home\\" goes from the late 1950's to 1963, and deals with the place where Dylan grew, and the kind of music he liked. I found this specially interesting, as I hadn't heard of Woody Guthrie, Tommy Makem, and others that had an enormous influence on Dylan. I enjoyed watching and hearing him as he developed as an artist, and changed accordingly.<br /><br />\\"Part two\\" covers the period that goes from 1963 to 1966. It is very good, and has great footage of Dylan's concerts, like \\"Part one\\". The main difference between the two dvds probably is that the second one lacks the kind of explanation regarding the historical context that the first one has. All the same, it is enjoyable, and only obviously in fault when compared to \\"Part one\\".<br /><br />This documentary includes lots of footage of the young Dylan and comments made by the \\"old\\" Dylan, the person that young and gifted man grew up to be. Not only that, but there are also quite a few interviews of people who knew him at one moment or the other, and that help to shed some light on him. The interviews that involve Joan Baez are probably the most insightful regarding Bob Dylan's character, and his refusal to be trapped in a role as symbol of the left.<br /><br />I think that if there is a constant in Dylan's career, it is probably the fact that he refuses to be pinned down, to be anything other than himself, and that is nothing less and nothing more than what he feels like being at the moment. \\"No direction home\\" shows that, and I think we should congratulate Martin Scorsese for that. So... thanks, Martin, but please bear in mind I really, really want to watch the sequel  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000B5XOY8|4.0|This new DVD edition should definitely replace your old Batman DVD or, God forbid, VHS tape.  There are hours of bonus features included, mostly done in documentary format.  All angles are covered on the 2nd disc.  Beginning with the original Batman creator, Bob Kane, through the lengthy history of Batman, to the ultimate cinematic adaptation by Tim Burton, who also speaks at great length about the production of the film.  This is very interesting material that a fan will truly appreciate.<br /><br />This movie spoke for itself at the box office.  The combination of Tim Burton's vision and direction, impeccable casting and wonderful special effects took the movie world by storm and reached far beyond the silver screen.  For a while there, you couldn't look anywhere without seeing the Batman logo.  They did some job marketing this movie...<br /><br />I still feel this is the best Batman movie.  Points can be made in favor of the most recent Batman Begins, but having no precursor, Burton's Batman set the stage wonderfully to begin the modern Batman film-making era.  After all, it seems people have granted such praise to Batman Begins, in part, for how it represents a return to the \\"darkness\\" of the original.
B00006JSGQ|5.0|This is not over the top rock and roll from Knopfler.  While there is clear joy to his music making evident here, this album is quietly thoughtful and sometimes with an edge.  Somebody mentioned the Making Movies period of songwriting in speaking about this album.  I'd say that this is about right.  Think about the way that Knopfler creates a dream-like beauty to some of those songs on the first Dire Straits live album and you'll get a sense about what much of what this album is like.  Yet, there are more straight ahead folk works on this album too.<br /><br />Knopfler's guitar playing, like the music itself, is not over the top but has a spare beauty to it, and there is probably no other guitar player that I know of that can create as beautiful a melodic line as Knopfler.<br /><br />Soundwise, the CD is quite good, though if you have the ability to play LPs and can find this one on the double-LP set, the LP sounds more real, and has more presence than the CD.<br /><br />On the other hand, the sound of the live tracks on the bonus CD (in those editions that include it) is wonderful.  The sound is practically a demonstration quality disc.  That's alot to be said for live recording.  The sound is full, dynamic and natural, with deep, tight extended bass (which means that hall acoustic ambiences are more apparent) and the highs are soft and sweet, not boosted or etched.  This is about as good as it gets for CD sound.  There is a very well filmed video included on the bonus CD of the same live performance of \\"Why Aye Man.\\"  This is Knopfler singing the song with heart and his guitar playing at his sympathetic and lyrical best (I felt my heart being tugged in the quieter moments of the song.).  It is clear that all the musicians thoroughly enjoy performing the song, as bittersweet as is the subject matter.<br /><br />Finally, this album may not GRAB you at first listen, but certainly the more I hear it, the more I am mesmerized by it.
B00062RCBW|5.0|As another reviewer stated, those who loved the original series were 'spoiled' by the original Star Trek series. I was one of the skeptics who loved the original series. I awaited the debut of this 'new' Star Trek show totally prepared to dislike it as a pathetic 'wanna-be'. I am happy to report that I was delightfully surprised with what was presented to me in the new series. There were some things about the Next Generation that took some getting used to. For one thing, I missed Spock - the character Data, at first, seemed a pale copy of my Vulcan hero. In addition, I had trouble with (forgive me Mr. Stewart) with the new captain of the Enterprise being bald. I also struggled with the new Number One... The chemistry between Kirk and Spock was so unique and subtly humorous- It took time for me to embrace this new Captain/Second in command relationship- it was wonderful, yes, but was so different than the latter.<br /><br />The long and short of things: I was hooked after the first season! I grew to love the new chemistry of the entire Next Generation crew as much or more than that of the old series.  As for the lightly haired captain... I think of Patrick Stewart as one of the sexiest guys on film! Oh, yes... Give me a bald leading man ANY day.<br /><br />NO, the new series isn't the same as the former, and frankly, if they'd tried to make it the 'same', Next Generation would not have done so well.<br /><br />So, I can say as a passionate space/science fiction junky- both on film and in literature, this is a 'must have' series.
068987474X|5.0|This is the best book written for women on men.  I love Greg's insight as well as his line \\"don't waste the pretty.\\"  I read the book and gave it to my 16 year old daughter to read who read it and passed it on to her friends.  When you finally realize that maybe \\"he's just not that into you\\" it frees you from months of self-examination and gives you the power back to move on!  A MUST read for any girl/women who is in and/or entering the dating game.  Greg reminds you that you are beautiful and you deserve to be appreciated and loved for the beauty you are.  The time has come to stop wasting the pretty!
B00007E8V4|5.0|I really did steal this from my buddy.  He let me borrow it, and I never gave it back.  Anyways, Just like all the other albums, Steal this is an awesome album with sweet guitar riffs and aggressive rock grooves.  I highly recommend buying this or stealing it from a friend.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I have all the seasons so far. I bought them all for my sister too. Who also loves them. It isn't just for girls. My husband and son also really like them.  <br />dlb
B0007N1AI6|5.0|This is the best album Priest has put out yet.  It lacks nothing that Painkiller had.  The riffs are still there musically.  Hellrider is the best track on the album.  Just listen to it, it speaks for itself. Great riffs and leads throughout, especially closer to the end.  The lyrics are meaningful in a few of the songs  and the rest are just classic Priest.  Some might call them \\"cheesy\\" but they clearly haven't listen to any older albums or they'd know they've always been like that.  Just deal with it, that's what Priest does. Either way my favorite album for 2005 by far.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a remarkable television series.  Science-fiction with a western feel.  Thoughtfully constructed 3-dimensional characters, a cast with great chemistry that is obviously having a wonderful time with the material, a superior blend of action/adventure drama and comedy, clever dialog, an interesting culture, solid and creative camera-work.  Cancelled as a result of mistreatment at the hands of FOX (Friday death-slot, frequent pre-emption, showing episodes out of order, not airing the pilot until the end of the run, etc.),Firefly is among the best science fiction series of all time.  You won't regret taking the time to discover Firefly.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|This movie is very faithful to the novel by Jane Austen. All-star cast (including a young Ewan McGregor aka young Obi-Wan Kenobi in the latest \\"STAR WARS\\" trilogy; see my reviews of those films) is aided by an excellent script which sticks closely to the classic novel by Jane Austen. I highly recommend viewing this one alongside \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" (please see my review on that film). Rated PG for mild thematic elements.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|CAME IN GOOD TIME , IN EXCELLENT CONDITION THANKS, MARTHA REEDY COLUMBUS, OHIO
B00000G3AZ|4.0|I enjoy all of Jane Austin's books/videos/DVD's.  This particular video of \\"Emma\\" is a different version than I had seen before and, while this one is good, I prefer the other version/edition.

B000002J0B|5.0|This album is what sold me on Zeppelin.. having been a huge huge huge Beatle's fan... I can't tell you how much this album has affected me.. it's incredible.. it's emotional.. it's very creative.. and it's beautiful.. certainly one of the greatest albums of all time.. Great composition.... Great Rock and Roll!!!!!!
B00063F8B2|5.0|Great soundtrack, fun to list to, and all ages. Best song will have to be When Christmas Comes to Town.. but all are good! Definatly recommended.
B000002UDB|5.0|I love Magical Mystery Tour <br /> but I don't really consider it an album just because of the fact that it has a bunch of their singles on it ... That being said,  <br />this is a great collection of later Beatles.... <br />I'd buy it even if you allready have Penny Lane, I am The Walrus, Strawberry Fields, and All You Need Is Love because the other tracks (i.e. Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know...etc...) are way more than filler
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a great show!  Fantastic writing, characters I fell in love with, it is so sad that the show was cancelled before it had a chance.   I'd rather watch Firefly over and over again than most of what is on TV now.
B000002UAR|5.0|Starting right around this period (from 66 onward to 70), Paul McCartney single-handedly changed the course of popular music. He took over The Beatles, he drove The Beatles, and made astonishing awe inspiring music. To describe the peak this man had during this time is nothing short of remarkable. Paul's music between 1966 to 1970 spawned such classics as: Here There and Everywhere, For No One, Got to Get You Into My Life, Good Day Sunshine, With a Little Help From My Friends, Getting Better, She's Leaving Home, Hello Goodbye, Lady Madonna, Hey Jude, I Will, Martha My Dear, Mother Natures Son, Two of Us, Oh Darling, The Abbey Road Suite, Let It Be, and The Long and Winding Road. Of course John acted as Paul's editor of sorts; but this too is to Paul's credit because he knew John made him better. I don't even know one professional athlete (save Michael Jordan) who had this kind of incredible output in a superstar career.
0307276902|4.0|I DON'T CARE if parts of this were embellishments and Oprah's PO'd....it's still a good story
0553801503|3.0|As many have mentioned GRRM has split his novel into 2 parts so this is essentially half of the fourth book.  Many have used this to explain the drop off from the first three, but I feel the book lacked a lot more than half the characters. <br /> <br />In each of the first three novels I was drawn into the story and emotionally attached to each of the main characters.  The trials and tribulations affected me personally as I read through the story.  I felt Martin was telling a tale about people I had knew and loved.  Unfortunately this feeling was completely lost to me in the fourth book.  So many times during the fourth novel I got the mental image of Martin glancing at a flow chart of the story and typing the story with out thought to emotion of the story line.  To me it really felt more like a fictional history book, than the gripping individual struggles of the other three books.  The story itself is good, but what made the other books great instead of just good is missing. <br /> <br />If you have read the first three books and loved them you might as well chug on to the fourth, but if you can take it or leave it based on the first three, then I can say with confidence to not bother.
B00005JSGK|4.0|I am not a big fan of westerns so I didn't see many of John Wayne's movies, but I did see and like Hatari, The High and the Mighty, and the War Wagon...two comedies and one suspence.  Hatari has a great cast, and an excellent script and footage of the animals is fantastic.  But I'm glad animals are no longer collected for zoos in this way.  Nevertheless this is a fun movie, and I have enjoyed it everyone of the (at least) 20 times I've seen it over the years.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|I purchased this one from Amazon on its release and this review is long over due. Warner Home Video have really done themselves proud with this superb presentation. In fact, it most likely looks better now than on its original release in 1938; that's the year of my birth. I remember seeing it in my local cinema, in England, when it was doing the rounds on its second release in the late 1940's, it enthralled me then and still does so now, even after numerous viewings.    This film has all the ingredients necessary for a smash hit, (or block buster, in modern terms) which are: the actors with the necessary charm and charisma for the leads (Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Claud Rains, Basil Rathbone, Eugene Pallete, Alan Hale, Patric Knowles, Ian Hunter and Montague Love), the necessary character actors for support and comedy (Herbert Mundin, Una O'Conner and Melville Cooper), direction ( William Keighley and Michael Curtez), music score (Erich Wolfgang Korngold), and superb editing of the finished product. That it was a 'smash hit' is undisputed, whether it is, or was, the best version of \\"Robin Hood\\" is a matter of opinion. For me, personally, it is unsurpassed and it is most unlikely (but not impossible considering today's technology)to be surpassed in this age in which we live.    Errol Flynn was at his 'dashing' best; athletic, witty and charming. Fast moving but literate, he played no better role, in no better movie at any time during his career; a much better actor than he was ever given credit for. What better villain could the studio produce than Basil Rathbone? As for some comic relief; who could better Herbert Mundin (very popular in the 1930's, see \\"Mutany On the Bounty\\", \\"David Copperfield\\" and many others) as \\"Much the Miller's son\\" with Una O'Connor as his love interest; and Melville Cooper as a bumbling Sheriff of Nottingham? Legend says that the Sheriff was really a most evil and vile person but here the producers decided to make him more of a figureof fun.     This two disc presentation has loads of bonus features, all of which have been given a great deal of thought and are subsequentely well worth viewing. Disc 1 The movie, a feature length commentary by Film Historian Rudy Behlmer, a music only Audio Track, Leonard Maltin hosts Warner Night at the Movies 1938 with 1)Trailer for Angels with Dirty Faces - 2) Newsreel - 3)Musical Short with Freddie Rich and His Orchestra and 4) Merrie Melodies Cartoon Katnip Kollege; and finally twelve Trailers all Errol Flynn movies including the 1938 and 1942 releases of the Adventures of Robin Hood. Disc 2 has a host of interesting shorts including sequences not used in the film, an Annual Year End Blooper Reel. Robin Hood through the Ages with a look at other film adaptations; a look at some rare Home Movie shots taken by Basil Rathbone on location or on the studio backlot; cartoons Bugs Bunny in \\"Rabbit Hood\\" and Daffy Duck in \\"Robin Hood Daffy\\"; other shorts are Calalcade of Archery; The Cruise of the Zaca; Splitting the Arrow containing extra info on the making of the movie; the Robin Hood Radio Show from May 11, 1938 an audio broadcast; a Korngold piano session and finally Angelia Lansbury narrates a short on the evolution of the Vivid Film Making Process of Which The Adventures of Robin Hood is a Shimmering Example. The contents of the discs are as stated on the inside cover of the box set; a superb presentation in its self.    The production values in the main movie were, and still are, there for all to see; the brilliant three colour early Technicolor, the superb music score which audibly grabs and excites the viewer into believing (at least for a time) what they are seeing, the excellent sets of medieval England and the superb editing of the finished product which brings it all together. This one was, still is and will continue to be great entertainment with lots of fun for young and old alike. 5 Stars - a pity I can't give it 10!    Incidentally, the DVDs are region encoded 1,2,3,4, and 5. Can be viewed anywhere in the world; as are the other Warner box set Errol Flynn The Signature Collection, also highly recommended. I must get around to doing a review on this one too!
B000002KIE|5.0|Shrieking Sid was the guy who fulfulled the unspoken prophecy of rock & roll: something that began with such crowd pleasers as the toy Negroes (Little Richard, Chuck Berry etc etc etc) and the white redneck yodelers (Elvis & his imitators)in the airhead Fifties. Scream and beat on your instruments, in the way that any idiot could, amplified and recorded and promulgated, if they were in the right place at the right time. And they brought into the open, again with appropriate historical symmetry, something the gaping American teenyboppers (and I include the belchers and drug addicts and the rest of the lumps in that class) apparently didn't know: the English hate each others' guts. What a revelation, kiddies! Didn't you know grinning tomming Little Richard hated you, and so did Elvis, if you were a Yankee? No? And Bob Dylan hates you too! Dummards! And now you have Rap! Kind of post-modern, really. Or is it post-post by now? Hey, it isn't just PLAYING at being human rubbish, you really are!  <br />Thanks, Sid!
0876855575|1.0|This is the worst book I've ever read. There's no moral, theme or lesson behind it. You don't learn anything. It's not interesting. There are a thousand different characters and it's nearly impossible to keep track of which one is which because every character is equally boring, uninteresting and one-dimensional. Also, Bukowski was obviously a sick, perverted, twisted person. He refers to one guy as a \\"fetus-eater,\\" and he goes into detail explaining things about bowel movements and masturbation (and in one case, one of his friends does a sexual favor for a dog). The story takes place from the early 1920's through 1941, and before I read it, I thought it might give an interesting perspective on what it was like to live at that time, with the depression and then pearl harbor going on, but no. It was boring as hell. Bukowski's life is incredibly boring and uneventful, and I really don't understand why he chose to give the world the misfortune of this book. It's terrible. Nothing happens. It ends so abruptly. I hate Bukowski.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|The name Nausicaa comes from Homer's Odyssey--she is the princess who finds Ulysses on the beach and takes him to the king's palace.  She is one of the most endearing figures in Homer's story.  This moview develops an enviromental story of a princess beloved by her people who dwell in the Valley of the Winds.  The moview is beautifully done, most imaginative, and the characters are rendered very well.  It's one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.

B00006FDCD|5.0|For the plot details, here is what the back of the DVD box reads:<br />\\"IT can be anything. A fanged monster that won't stay on the movie screen. Something ominous lurking in the basement. No matter what your biggest fear is, no one knows IT better than Stephen King. Based on King's 1986 bestseller, IT is a jittery, jolting excursion into personal fear starring Harry Anderson, Annette O'Toole, John Ritter and Richard Thomas. A malevolent force in a small New England town takes the shape of a clown (Tim Curry), but he's not clowning around. Instead, he terrifies youngsters and brings some of their untimely doom -- until some wily kids fight back. The evil resurfaces 30 years later: meaner, angrier, dealier. And friends who vividly remember youthful terrors reunite to battle IT.\\"<br /><br />Stephen King's IT has become a horror classic. And, surprisingly enough, it was a made-for-TV miniseries (a two-nighter). Running at a little over three hours long and designed to be appropriate for the average Joe tuning in to its original broadcast in 1990, you'd think it'd be a bit of a stinker. But by all means, IT provides a thrilling and darkly charasmatic adventure into one very terrifying story. Great script, great directing, great cast. And the best part? Well...<br /><br />Remeber Bozo? Ah, what a great guy. How about Clarabell, or even Ronald McDonald? Clowns have been a real treat to the entertainment business for as long as we can remember. But Tim Curry changed that for oh so many children and adults alike with this film. Undeniably the star of the show -- whether for freaky amusement or inescapable horror -- Curry really helped this along in its long running time. Don't get me wrong, the character development through childhood scenes and drama unfolding between them as adults really keeps the viewer interested and engaged. But let's face it, without Curry's performance there would be something missing. Luckily, we're given plenty of delightfully scary scenes showing off the unforgettable portrayal of history's most malevolent clown throughout the film.<br /><br />By the end, you can't help but to feel for the characters and be glued to the screen -- even if you've seen it already. It's one of the best examples out there of how a lot of time can actually be put to good use and overall make a great movie. IT -- just like many of King's writings -- really grabs the viewer and reflects on something we can all look back at with awe and mystery: childhood.<br /><br />Sadly, there aren't many special features on this double-sided disc. But there is a fairly interesting commentary with Dennis Christopher, Tim Reid, John Ritter, Richard Thomas, and Director Tommy Lee Wallace (why no Curry? probably not available. they do talk about him a bit, though). And with a wonderful, crystal-clear print and audio, you won't mind the almost bear-bones packaging. So go ahead and pick this baby up for one hell of a ride into a nightmare where fear reigns over all!le portrayal of history's most malevolent clown throughout the film.

B0000C9JFO|4.0|Having Audrey Tautou as the central cover character is deceptive; she is a side character at best. So if you chose this movie in search of another Amelie, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br />That said, this movie was wonderfully well done and will resonate with most who have or are going through a crossroads in her/his life. Essentially the plot is about self discovery, leaving home in Paris for Barcelona, going to school, living life, breaking ties and reasserting them.  <br /> <br />The political element of the movie reflects on the hodgepodge  Europe is becoming due to the EU. It is not a negative analysis. Instead, it shows a melting pot akin to America's but with no dominant language and one melding culture. The movie itself is in French, English and Spanish, intermixed and about a 1/3 of the movie given to each.   <br /> <br />Barcelona sceney will likely provoke online pricing of a trip there...so beware.

0553579908|4.0|This was an excellent novel. However, the learnig curve relating to previous events is very high. Also, the book should not be read under the ages of 14-18. The author had a tendency towards realism. The book contains much explicit language. Also, the novel might not be understood without a previous knowledge of medieval terminology.
B000BYCAJE|3.0|I know this is sacrilege probably to some but this record hasn't stood the test of time all that great. There are definite highs - I still experience a definite frisson of delight every time I hear the opening chords and that great little bit where the bass kind of catches up of \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\", but this record has too many clunkers, or just plain uninteresting songs (for instance, \\"Pre-Road Downs\\") to really merit being called a classic. And, it also has what must be one of the absolute worst lines in a rock song ever: \\"Say can I have some of your purple berries\\", in \\"Wooden Ships\\" - that made me cringe even when I thought this record was the sh-t...But before I go too overboard dissing them, let me say that they had some absolutely beautiful harmonies and there was something really fresh about them at the time this came out. It just took the addition of Neil Young (the star of the group, the real creative genius...always has been, always will be) to make it all coalesce into something interesting and compelling.
B00005B36H|5.0|Not only is this album Tool's best and most complex album, but it is by far the best album i have ever owned.  I have Tool's Aenima and Undertow CDs and they are five stars too, but if i could Lateralus would get 10 stars.  Plus Tool is coming out with a new CD sometime this spring.  For more information go to tool's \\"nearly official site\\" (go to google and type in \\"tool\\", you will see it) <br /> <br />Oh and the song Lateralus is the best song i have ever heard.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|Besides the fabulous eye candy, the movie was a completely different view of the first Gulf War. Very honest view of propaganda, men in the military, and war.
0060935464|5.0|Who is innocent, and who is not? To Kill a Mockingbird, written by Harper Lee, is a perfect example to prove even with an outstanding defense in court, we cannot ever be sure how a case will turn out. Jean Louise Finch (referred to as Scout in the book) is the main character in this story. Her problems are not the most complicated, but she was considered young to start going through them: watching Atticus, her father, try to protect an African American man who was accused of raping a white girl and more simple- lessons about life. Scout faced difficult feelings for being a \\"young girl\\". She would become angry at life and anything else in it when she did not understand something or when it was not fair. That is how life is, right? Sharing some of the same problems with Scout are other characters Jem, her older brother by four years; Charles Baker Harris (Dill), Scout's boyfriend who was introduced early in the book; Atticus, her father and an excellent lawyer; Calpurnia, the African American housekeeper in charge of the children due to their mother's death while Scout was two; and Aunt Alexandria, a mean sister of Atticus that tries to teach Scout how to become lady-like.  <br /> <br /> Throughout the tale, Scout learns how to live the \\"civil\\" way from her Aunt Alexandria. Scout was completely stubborn with her ideas because whatever she saw, she took in, would then comprehend it, and finally form her own opinion. Jem, Scout, and Dill were extremely determined to see \\"Boo\\" Radley release himself of his house because rumors proposed the idea of him being ghost-like, when all he did was keep to himself. This realistic fiction's theme in my opinion, we have to live life for ourselves because no one can live it for us. If that includes standing up for ourselves, then by all means do what we believe in. The way Harper Lee wrote this novel (flashback form told by Scout) reminded me of how Zora Neale Hurston wrote Their Eyes Were Watching God because they were both writtenin flashbacks.  <br /> <br /> To Kill a Mockingbird had an unbelievingly shocking ending and was written flawlessly. The book kept me reading until the end, where multiple surprises were waiting. Depending on the part of the story I was in, I felt happy or other sections had made me feel horrible. These emotions were mostly based on how life used to be with racism and how life is today with racism. Although Harper Lee published this as her only book, she wrote a few articles for American magazines. An all-around excellent book with several lessons dealing with the different aspects of life, I recommend this to all who are old enough to understand and enjoy. <br />
0671027387|5.0|When I first saw this book in a Dutch book store, it was called, translated, \\"The Delta Conflict\\".  However, I prefer the English version of these stories, so I love the book, but I find Dan Brown's title not the best choice, because it gives the plot away, in my opinion.  I do not want to say more about this to not spoil it for new readers, but this title leaves not much to the imagination.  Great book, though, fun reading.
0307276902|4.0|This book was selected for my book club before its authenticity was questioned, and we began reading it after we learned it was not all the author had promised.  I did enjoy it, though, and treated it as fiction.  James Frey's style of writing conjured up a real picture of an institution filled with a cross section of drug users who were real to the reader, with most becoming an ally and friend to the narrator.  Because he admittedly embellished some scenarios and blended certain events, the book should not be considered as an aid for drug abusers seeking inspiration in overcoming their addictions.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|It looks like it is not just the Milky Way galaxy where English is the universal language. It looks to be pretty common in the Pegasus galaxy as well. <br /> <br />Stargate Command decides to send an expedition to Atlantis. This is a dicey proposition because if the expedition cannot find more of the ZPM crystals, they will not have the energy to return. It could well be a one way mission. That sets up this spin-off series with its main premise. An expedition from Earth is stranded in a high tech environment.  <br /> <br />The series needs more than that, of course and it has it. Instead of the Goa'uld, they find a new adversary even nastier. These are the Wraith, a race which feeds on the life force of humans. They are a constant threat and the danger is that they may get access to Earth's home galaxy. That would not be good. <br /> <br />This series is not as much fun as the original Stargate. The chemistry between the main cast members is not as good as in the original. There is also something of the macabre about it all. Still, it is interesting enough and it is watchable. <br /> <br />Episode synopses appear below: <br /> <br />Rising Parts 1 and 2 - Daniel Jackson thinks he has finally figured out the location of the Ancient's city of Atlantis. It is in another galaxy. To get there will require using up the last ZPM crystal the earth has left. Because the potential payoff is so great, BG O'Neill is willing to take the risk and send a large group through. It is a one way trip but the hope is that power crystals will be found on the other side. They find Atlantis and it is indeed located under the sea. Their arrival, though, drains most of the power left in the local crystals and the city is in danger of imminent drowning. Now the Atlantis team must use the local gate to find another world to inhabit. The Ancients are gone. They were wiped out by a terrible enemy. Unfortunately, the planet visited by the expedition is being attacked by these new bad guys. They are called the Wraiths. These same wraiths captured a part of the expedition. Now, the SG Atlantis team needs only to learn to use the Ancient technology and rescue their compatriots from the wraiths who would eat them. Eat might not be the exact right word. They \\"eat\\" the life force, aging the victim. Even worse, they are not even the main threat.  <br /> <br />Hide and Seek - The Atlantis crew is still trying to settle in to their new city but they have some problems in that many of the gadgets need to be activated by a person with a rare gene. Dr. McKay finds a device he believes to be a personal shield and agrees to try an experimental gene therapy treatment to see if he can use the device. It works but there is a problem. He is invulnerable but nothing can get through the shield. That includes food and water and even his own hand. He cannot turn the device off. Meanwhile, some of the kids get themselves into trouble when playing hide and seek. One disappears. Not long after, people start seeing strange shadows and rumors of hauntings and general spookiness. The kid playing hide and seek has unwittingly let loose an energy being imprisoned since the time of the Ancients. Now it is feeding on the energy of the base and all are in trouble. Defeating it will take some uncharacteristic bravery on the part of McKay. <br /> <br />Thirty Eight Minutes - The Atlantis team carries out another recon of the Wraith planet. While there, they are ambushed and barely make it back to their shuttle. The shuttle sustains some damage and Maj. Sheppard is not much better off. He has been attacked by a giant, parasitic bug which has attached itself to his neck. Nothing they can do will make it dislodge itself and it is feeding off of his life force. The shuttle team has problems too. One of the engines didn't retract all the way and, as the ship tries to transit the wormhole, it gets stuck, part in and part out. Now time is running out. The wormhole will only be stable for 38 minutes. After that point, it shuts off and kills everyone. <br /> <br />Suspicion - Atlantis recon teams continue to encounter Wraiths on most of their missions. This happens even in the most unlikely and uninhabited places. Suspicion grows that there is a traitor or an agent among the refugees they have living with them. They are restricted in their movements and barred from use of the Stargate. Naturally, they resent this. Eventually, they move on to settle a land mass on the Atlantis planet. Still, the Wraiths seem to be getting information of the movement of the Atlantis teams. There is someone giving info to the enemy but it is not a traitor. <br /> <br />Childhood's End - While on a recon mission, the puddle jumper crashes and all electronic equipment ceases to operate. The team is then captured by a bunch of children. None of the locals is over 25 years of age. They believe that by killing themselves on their 25 birthday, the Wraiths are not attracted to their people. It is human sacrifice. The actual reason that the Wraiths do not return is more complex. There is a hidden device which messes up the electronics and keeps the Wraiths away. The device is powered by a ZPM crystal, the same type of crystal the team originally set out to find and which powers everything needed. Taking the crystal dooms the kids. Hotheads among the kids want to kill everyone just to be on the safe side. It is a nasty moral dilemma.  <br /> <br />Poisoning the Well - The Atlantis team finds a planet with a fairly high level of technology. It is still behind the Earth's but it shows some promise. The people of the planet store their knowledge in huge libraries to help them rebuild after each harvest by the Wraiths. They are on the verge of developing a vaccine that will render victims immune from the wraith feeding. With the help of the Atlantis team, they actually make a viable vaccine. When it is tested on the wraith prisoner, it does more than expected. It also poisons the Wraith. Thissounds good but the Atlantis crew fears that when the Wraiths learn of this, they will wipe out the entire planet to keep the knowledge of the vaccine from spreading. The politicians are adamant, though that the populace must be inoculated. Things get ugly when those inoculated start dying also.  <br /> <br />Underground - The Atlantis team heads out on a trade mission to a planet known to Kayla as simple, Amish style farmers. These guys drive a hard bargain and Shepherd has to go back to get authorization from Dr. Weir. When he comes back, he stumbles into a great secret. These are not the simple farmers they pretend to be. They have a hidden, underground civilization secretly working on a plan to fight the Wraiths. They think they can get an edge by getting more Atlantis technology. The problems, however, are multiple. The plans count on hibernating wraiths and the locals are unaware that the sleeping Wraiths have been wakened. A bigger problem, though, is that neither side really trusts the other. The biggest problem, however, is that these people are NOT trustworthy. <br /> <br />Home - Dr. McKay is an obnoxious and arrogant @$$ but he is a smart one. While the Atlantis team is investigating a new planet, they find a Stargate that is drawing an incredible amount of power right from the atmosphere. He thinks he can establish a wormhole back to earth with it. He is right and all of the leading characters report back to Earth to let the home folk know what is going on. They intend to return on the Prometheus but a problem develops. There is an accident on the ship and the leadership seems to be stuck on earth. The problems are worse than that, though. Each of the leadership seems to be having differing experiences that don't mesh with the others. It is quite confusing to the viewer for a while but it seems that each one is being thwarted in all attempts to get back to Atlantis base. The reason for this is simple. They are not on earth. Someone has a vested interestin keeping them from getting back. <br /> <br />The Storm - An incredibly huge storm threatens Atlantis. This is the type that only occurs every few centuries. It is so bad that Dr. Weir decides to evacuate temporarily to another planet. Finding a planet, though, proves difficult. Most people don't like to have well armed, technologically superior people running around in large numbers. A deal is struck, though, and it looks like everyone will make it to safety. The problem is that the \\"hosts\\" betray the problem to the Genii, the planet of untrustworthy humans who wanted A Bomb technology 2 episodes ago. They put together a strike team and seize control of Atlantis while most of the people are gone. They manage to capture most of the senior officers except for Maj. Sheppard. The episode ends with a hostile and tense standoff needing to be resolved in the next episode. <br /> <br />The Eye -Most of Atlantis has been evacuated because of a killer storm. A Genii strike force has seized the Atlantis and holds most of the command team from Atlantis hostage. Atlantis looks to be completely wiped out by the storm unless McKay and Weir, two of the hostages, can use lightning from the storm to power the city's shields. Maj. Sheppard is on the loose playing commando and trying to take back the critical functions while saving the lives of the hostages. A few people caught on the mainland in a puddle jumper during the storm are all the allies he has. It's a race against the clock and killer waves. It's an exciting episode. <br /> <br />The Defiant One - An Atlantis scientist discovers something interesting at one of the Lagrange points. It is a satellite and a moon. They also hear a distress signal...a wraith distress signal. When they go to investigate, they find a wraith supply ship. They assume that after 10,000 years, there must be no survivors. They are wrong. The Wraiths are a hardy and persistent species. The Wraith survivor is also very hungry. That means a bad day forthe expedition. The last news that the Wraith has heard was that the Wraiths had Atlantis under siege. Now, Maj. Sheppard tells him that the Wraith lost the war. That does not stop him from trying to steal the ship though. It's another race against time as the Wraith tries to eat everyone and escape and the Major tries to kill the wraith and hold out for the relief force. <br /> <br />Hot Zone - After the big storm the Atlantis crew is looking the city over to ascertain damage. While a ways of from the HQ, a few of one of the survey teams starts having terrifying visions. After a few such visions, the affected person dies of a cerebral hemorrhage. When others start to be affected, a quarantine and lockdown is instituted. An Ancient virus has been accidentally released. Unfortunately, one of the party got away in his panic and has affected lots of others. Now panic is running rampant as some people are frightened of the virus and others are frightened of the visions. Now McKay, who is infected himself, must figure out a cure. He has a few hints but its going to mean some risks. <br /> <br />Sanctuary - While on a survey in a Puddlejumper, Maj. Sheppard and his team come under fire from Wraith ships. It doesn't look like they are going to make it but, suddenly, all the Wraith ships are destroyed by some weapon from the planet below them. That sounds like technology, or at least some energy crystals, which Atlantis desperately needs. When they get to the planet surface, they find a peaceful and pastoral culture with little sophistication and no high technology. They all share a common religion, though. In an effort to learn more, Sheppard seeks out a \\"priestess\\". She is intriguing but declines to offer sanctuary. She does come back to Atlantis for a visit, however. There, she seems too perfect and too good to be true. That is because she is not what she seems. Without knowing it, the Atlantis crew has found someone for whom they have been desperately seeking. They have found her but she will not help. <br /> <br />Before I Sleep - While exploring new parts of the city, a team stumbles onto a stasis chamber with a live but extremely old inhabitant. They believe this to be one of the Ancients. When the sleeper is revived, however, the crew of Atlantis is in for a shock. The sleeper is Dr. Weir, another version of Dr. Weir who has been asleep for 10000 years. She is in frail health and not expected to last to long but she has information to impart. In her reality, the arrival of the Atlantis crew started a fatal series of events that destroyed the city. In a last ditch effort to escape, she and a few others got aboard one of the puddlejumper ships and found themselves in a battle with the wraiths. As they desperately tried to figure out the controls, they activated one which sent them back in time 10000 years to the Ancients. There the battle with the Wraiths was raging also and all are killed but her. The Atlantians are about to evacuate to Earth and they invite her to go with them. Instead, she chooses to enter stasis so that she can replace the power crystals of the city as needed over her long sleep.  <br /> <br />The Brotherhood - It looks like the information on ZPM energy crystals brought back by the alternate Dr. Weir in the previous episode might bear some fruit. They find a planet where one of the ZPMs was venerated by an ancient religious brotherhood who regarded the Ancients as gods. The brotherhood was destroyed by a Wraith culling. Now, the Atlantis team must figure out where the brotherhood hid the ZPM. They can do it but there are a few problems. The Genii commando leader who captured Atlantis a few episodes back is aware of what they are doing and he has his own plans to capture the device. The plans do not take into consideration the wishes of the current occupants of the planet. Worst of all, a Wraith fleet is headed towards Atlantis. <br /> <br />Letters from Pegasus - It looks like the entire Wraith fleet is onits way to wipe out Atlantis. Things are looking grim and the leadership team decides to risk using every available amount of power they have in order to open a wormhole back to earth for a few seconds and send a message warning about the Wraiths. They are able to compress all of their data into a small burst. There is still some time left over for people to send personal messages. So it is that we have a retrospective episode with flashbacks. There is a little bit of story, however. Maj. Sheppard heads out in a puddlejumper to do a recon on the Wraith route of advance. They encounter the Wraith on a feeding expedition at a planet and it seems they have a new weapon which Sheppard goes out to investigate. That gives Kayla the opportunity to try and save a few people and thereby endanger the entire expedition when there is not enough room to take a whole planet.  <br /> <br />The Gift - As the Wraith fleet draws ever closer, the Atlantis crew continues to seek other locations to which they can evacuate. While this is going on, Tayla is experiencing terrible nightmares of the Wraiths. She has the ability to sense their presence and she believe these nightmares are somehow connected to that ability. Matters get worse when the dreams begin to star her as the wraith. This experience leads her to investigate why she has this ability that so few of her people have. She learns that it is because of a genetic experiment conducted by the Wraith long ago. She has some wraith DNA. This gives Atlantis some advantage. If she can channel this ability, she should be able to gather invaluable intelligence. Unfortunately, the link works both ways. The Wraith have a much bigger goal than Atlantis. <br /> <br />Siege Part 1 - The episode is about contingencies as Atlantis awaits the coming of the Wraith fleet. Part of the crew keeps looking for sites on which to evacuate. Part searches for a way to destroy Atlantis to keep it from falling into the hands of the Wraith. Part tries to salvage as much information as possible. Dr. McKay, the arrogant ass, comes up with a possible solution. He thinks he can use a naquada generator to power up the old defense satellite from earlier in the season and heads out to try and power it up. Things are not going smoothly. Dr. Weir cannot decide what she wants to save. The local evacuees don't want Atlantis to be destroyed because it is an artifact of the Ancients they venerate; they don't care about earth. The Wraiths have a hidden agent aboard Atlantis and suspicion turns towards Kayla. McKay manages to get the weapon working partially but it is not as effective as would be wished. The Wraith are still closing in. <br /> <br />Siege Part 2 - Just as Atlantis is about to be evacuated, help arrives from Earth. An arrogant marine colonel shows up with some techno toys and relieves Dr. Weir. He also manages to alienate just about everyone with whom he comes in contact. The toys brought with them are not enough to defeat the Wraith but they are enough to (probably) hold them off for a while. This is helpful because more help is on the way. The Daedelus is on its way from earth with a newly discovered ZPM crystal to power the first line defenses.  It's a near run thing. The new toys work but they don't work as well as hoped. The Wraith are still closing in and they manage to land some troops on Atlantis itself. There is a possible way to hold out but it involves the cooperation of the Genii. They have never been known for their ability work and play well with others. The plan looks like it might work until power levels drop too low. The solution is a suicide mission with Maj. Sheppard as the star performer. The season ends with the outcome of the battle in doubt. <br />
0792164903|4.0|Great acting and a new twist to an old story.  Fantastic.
0740748475|5.0|This is a delightful three volume set for those who love the this little kid and his tiger.  The printing, paper and color are beautiful - totally first class all the way.  Just thumbing through it at random will pick up your spirits on the worst of days.  The way it is put together, it will be something to pass down to future generations.

B0000019PA|4.0|Gospel Album, August 15, 2006  Reviewer: XraySpex - See all my reviews   The music is great. I don't have the slightest problem with the guys voice either. I could care less if a person hits notes. I will take a voice that expresses an emotion rather than hits notes anyday. That said his lyrics are many times infuriating. When he sings stream of conscious ones dealing with a surreal reality they are great and have meaning. The problem is his education. He spews out the religious and spirituality dogma of the ignorant masses. Jesus is dead. People do not have souls, they have brains, and ghosts are a ridiculous concept. He sings about these things as if they exist. Step into this century and take some science classes before you continue to brainwash the masses as our whole culture does with these idiotic ideas. This is a gospel album that all you ignorant, uneducated, morons out there will love. Enjoy.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|The show has a great story line and a wonderful cast of characters. The only problem.......it ended.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I can not believe some of these reviews.  You have to be extremely ignorant to compare \\"Wicked\\" the musical or the book to MGM's version of \\"Wizard of Oz\\".  Here is an example: <br /> <br />      Its songs aren't the only failure. The whole storyline is absolutely awful.  <br />      If you watch \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and keep \\"Wicked\\" in mind, you will realize                             how little the plots go together. Have they even seen the movie? <br /> <br />As you can see, this person believes that \\"Wicked\\" is based on the movie.  It is actually based on Frank Baum's \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\".  \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" as a book is completely different than the movie.  So do not compare the musical/book with the movie, because you would be dissapointed.  Instead read the original book.  The musical is and incredible show.  It stirrs all these emptions in you.  Anger, saddnes, happiness, fun.  It is truly incredible.
B00012QKSI|4.0|Ok! I am not slamming this CD. It is a great CD. But, where is Craig Armstrong's Portugese Love Theme? I tried ordering this CD and was continually getting the Amazon.com is sorry but there is a delay in your order email. I googled the soundtrack and it came up on amazon.com/uk. Very happy to see the extra tracks included (Wherever You Will Go by The Calling is also included.) My main reason for the soundtrack was for PM's Love Theme which is not available on the domestic release. Never knew you could get a soundtrack with Portugese Love Theme on it as well. I was pleasantly surprised and bought it on the spot. Was actually less expensive to purchase and ship airmail then to purchase domestically as an import. Needless to say but will say anyway, I cancelled my amazon.com order and received my import directly from amazon/uk. My advice...if you are interested in this soundtrack, try amazon.com/uk.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fantastic series. To be honest when I first viewed the show on television I was not impressed so I ignored it till \\"Serenity\\" was released. I enjoyed the movie on all levels and immediatly decided to see what I had actually missed from the series. This is just good sci-fi television, you have a set of characters who interact despite their differences and previous histories somtimes in very humorous ways and it works in very much the same way \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel\\" did. Also for those picky about space science, the creators   provide no sound effects in space, this is somthing rarely seen. The visual effects are on par, sound effects are fantastic, and all the actors know how to play their parts. It is however depressing that after watching the series you realize that all you have left is the movie. The box set also has some great special features about the making of the series and the sets. I recommend this to any Joss Whedon or sci-fi fan, and if you are not either of those, give it a shot anyway you might see somthing you like.
6305428050|5.0|I am certain that \\"Adventures in Babysitting\\" was released as just another wacky \\"teen\\" comedy.  But, the performances have made this a classic--at least in our family.  Elizabeth Shue and the fun cast put together a film that stays with you and that you want to watch over and over again!
0440539811|5.0|Okay. The best point in the development of your psyche at which to read this book is a dangerous time for modern mind. Homo Sapiens Sapiens can either be seduced by the Fountainhead well of teenage bitch idolatry or the marvelously uncreatively constructed John Gault, hero of Atlas Shrugged. Rather than falling in love with the prince charming to J.A.P.s, its best to learn to rely on yourself in a confusing world in a more constructive way than by being guilted into trying to take it over, because maybe you could if you became something...that...doesn't resemble any person that ever lived nor any person that ever will without extensive genetic clipping and splicing. or whatever it is we will have to become to survive when there are warhead equipped robotic sharks in our bays and and we take fallout in our coffee. Eschaton. Hail.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I loved the take-off of Kung-Fu  movies. There's plenty action and also some comdey>>as my son calles it dark humor.  for those of you who enjoy this type of movies I give it a thumbs up!!!
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie was a gift for my wife! Let's say both of us enjoyed the movie. It was very touching...
B000067J1H|5.0|I've known about \\"Fight Club\\" for quite some time now and I wasn't really interested in it when it came out. But I'm a big fan of fighting movies so when I saw this, it blew my mind. Not only did it provide hard as nails brawling, but it also had a psychological story behind it. Edward Norton's character and Brad Pitt's character are complete polar opposites, yet the same as well. While one has a well-paying career, a lavish lifestyle, and goes to disorder meetings for comfort (even though he is perfectly normal), the other is satisfied without material posessions, lives in an abandoned house, and has a great knowledge of explosives. But together, they start a chain of fight clubs that spread throughout the entire world. These fight clubs aren't spoken about, but they are well known centers of one-on-one basement brawls. Soon these organizations grow into groups that try to completely break down society as we know it. While Norton's character tries to stop it, he doesn't know that the entire thing was on his own accord. While I learned something new about how the human psyche works, I also regained a new love for fighting. I recommend this movie whole heartedly.
B000002U82|5.0|How can anyone not like Dark Side of the Moon. This album is still great after 30 plus years. Songs like Time, Money, Us and Them and Brain Damage/Eclipse are still relevant today in 2006. Even if PF don't ever record again, this record will still sell after we are all dead!. If you think of trashing this record again, I'll give you a GOTCHA!

0684847817|1.0|I'm a long-time collector of Froud and a WOF member. This book was purchased by my husband from my Wish List. I was delighted to receive it but was very disappointed in the quality of the edition. A complete set of 24-pages was missing and replaced with a duplicate set. Amazon's Customer Service (always great to work with) sent a replacement immediately but that book was also a a printing disaster. All the graphics had inappropriate color bled into the images (excessive blue, yellow, red). Definitely not acceptable in a book purchased not only for it's amusing text, but particularly for it's artwork. I returned it also as Amazon could not guarantee me an edition without the printing errors.  As usual, they issued a total refund (thanks amazon).
B00005JO1R|4.0|In watching WALK THE LINE I couldn't help but be struck by the parallels between Johnny Cash's background and that of my mother.  Like him, she was raised in a small Arkansas town (albeit in the hills in the northern part of the state rather than the delta area) in a somewhat rustic house and was often called upon to join her family in picking cotton.  And like Johnny Cash, in an effort to find a better life left the small town she grew up in for Memphis (though she later relocated to Little Rock).  So, this is a movie that is very much about my kind of people.<br /><br />The parallels between WALK THE LINE and last year's RAY will be obvious to everyone who has seen both films.  Both deal with Southern-born musicians who struggled with drugs before eventually kicking the habit.  The romantic parallels are not so sharp, but the relative period of their success was close.  Johnny Cash was not the musical innovator that Ray Charles was, but both achieved a place close to the hearts of Americans.  Interestingly, it was Johnny Cash, the white Arkansan who achieved crossover success as a country performer who was involved in more liberal causes, while the black Floridian Ray Charles was a Republican.  I mention this just to highlight what ironic and unusual paths people's lives can take.<br /><br />The film covers the life of Johnny Cash roughly from his early childhood until just before his marriage to June Carter.  In talking to friends, I have been amazed that even those who have seen the film were unaware of June Carter's background, and when I mentioned the Carter Family they were not clear on who they were.  If there is a First Family in American country music, it is the Carter Family.  Along with Jimmy Rodgers, they were the most influential act in early country music history, and those two along with Hank Williams are the genre's greatest musical influences.  Formed by A. P. Carter, Maybelle Carter was his sister-in-law and one of the most important influences on American guitar finger picking, developing the walking bass note that is fundamental to music ever since.  When A. P. and his wife divorced, Maybelle took over the group, involving her daughters in what was essentially the second version of the Carter Family.  June was one of those daughters.<br /><br />Before their deaths June and Johnny Cash gave their blessings to this production and gave final approval to the performers who would play them.  On the acting end of things both performers are simply outstanding, and both fully deserve the Oscar nominations both have received.  Reese Witherspoon is simply adorable as June Carter, generating more charisma than one could think possible.  She is much shorter than the real June Carter, but since Joaquin Phoenix is much, much shorter than Johnny Cash, giving away about a half a foot, their heights are not terribly disproportionate.  Both performers worked vigorously on their singing in preparing for the film.  Reese, especially, does a good job with her singing.  She doesn't capture that snarl that made June Carter so much fun to listen to, but she nonetheless does a very credible job singing.  Phoenix gives it a great try, but how could any actor be asked to emulate Johnny Cash?  It simply can't be done.  Johnny Cash had one of the few great bass voices in popular music and even though for the most part he sang in a baritone range, there was always a depth and deepness to his voice that undergirt all he did.  And when he did need to drop down for those low, low, low notes, he did so effortlessly.  Phoenix simply can't pull it off. It really isn't his fault at all.  No other actor I know of could have done any better.  He does, however, at least pull off a lot of the rambunctiousness of the young Johnny Cash.  My daughter when in junior high bought a poster of the young Johnny Cash and put it in her room.  It shows Johnny Cash leaning forward from the stage towards the audience, almost savage in his demeanor, pointing one hand towards someone in the crowd, middle finger extended in an obscene gesture.  As he aged, perhaps calmed by his relationship with June it became more difficult to discern that wild man, but Phoenix certainly captures much of that.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very good movie and I enjoyed every aspect of it.  My only serious regret is Phoenix's singing.  This is unfortunately not a peripheral matter.  Johnny Cash possessed one of the most unique, marvelous voices of his generation, and having anyone play him who cannot absolutely nail the singing would be a mistake.  It would be like having someone play Frank Sinatra.  You have to get the voice.  Still, it would be a hard person who couldn't find a great deal in this film to love.  And if for no other reason, one has to see this simply to see how precious Reese Witherspoon is.nting one hand towards someone in the crowd, middle finger extended in an obscene gesture.

B00005JLR8|4.0|In the old days this movie would have been called a \\"chick flick\\".  Sheridan does a good job of showing familial relationships in the cultural melting pot of modern day NYC.  The family consists of a husband and wife with two young daughters who are trying to make it in America as poor Irish emigrants.  Throw in the fact that the family has just experienced the death of another child, a young brother.  One of the daughters is the narrator of this movie and wise beyond her years.
B0002NRQTS|4.0|This is one of my top 5 Rush albums but mostly because of 3 songs, in order of preference.  The Pass, Available Light, and Show Don't Tell. <br /> <br />For some years now, The Pass has been my favorite Rush song, finally replacing Vital Signs (from Moving Pictures).  Not only tackling non-standard lyrical fare in typical Rush fashion (this one's about teen depression and suicide), but this song has to have the best melody of any song they've ever written.  The melody may have modal leanings.  Dunno.  I know it's not often you hear vocalists comfortably doing major 7th and 9ths as part of the melody (basically sticking with the B-flat scale even on an E-flat chord, for example.  And in typical Rush fashion, not slavishly sticking with \\"guitar keys\\".  Name a key, and Rush has probably covered it. <br /> <br />The melody to this song is so beautiful, I'm grateful that there's a section where Geddy sings it accompanied by nothing but a simple bass line, and other places where phrases are punctuated by the whole band dropping out while he belts out the words.  The acapella \\"Christ, what have you done!\\" still sends shivers through my spine to this day. <br /> <br />Available Light is another song that's really poignant and especially meaningful to a lot of Rush's fans who grew up with the band and are therefore the same age.  In the same vein as \\"Time Stand Still\\", not so much grousing about how much it sucks to be getting old, but expressing a desire to wrap our arms around the here and now while we still can.  My favorite lyric in this one, which I think is a real stunner is \\"Run to light from shadow.  Sun gives me no rest.  Promise offered in the east is broken in the west.\\" using the sun as a metaphor for our cradle to grave journey. <br /> <br />Show Don't Tell, I just like because it's an unapologetic rocker that's easy to like even on the first listen. <br /> <br />While I don't particularly care for a lot of songs on this album, it's currently my favorite just because of The Pass and Available Light. <br /> <br />A good album to introduce your non-fan friends who prefer ballads to hard-core rock music.  Suck them in with the pair of beautiful ballads then hit them with the others that show off their musical prowess and power just a bit more.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't know how I missed this series when it was on the boob tube. My wife and I are Start Trek and Farscape lovers, and this series is in the same vein. If you are not a science fiction fan, this DVD will probably still wow you. It's all about the wonderful story crafting - not just outer space. I was intrigued by the Serenity movie promos, and after seeing the motion picture, I just had to have the entire series. It is well worth it and I loved every single episode. I can't help but think that if this series had been properly promoted, it would have been a hit. The acting is excellent and the world created by Josh Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) is very lush and endlessly interesting. Get this DVD - You will not be disappointed.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|Disney ever since Snow White has rarely managed to disappoint. It may not have classic resonance but there was enough charm and likability to it that it was not a complete throwaway. After a gap which stopped with the Little Mermaid, Disney did one great film after another ending(arguably with the Lion King although Mulan and Hercules had its moments). Once Lion King stopped, an odd shift happened where the great Disney films were now Pixar made. So Pixar on their 3rd film, decided to revisit the characters of their first classic and ends up with a great film surpassing the original. <br /> <br />The gang are still in Andy's room although Woody ends up getting his arm slightly ripped which causes Woody to end up on the shelf. He meets Wheezy the penguin who gets thrown out for yard sale. Woody decides to rescue Wheezy but gets toynapped(just had to make that wordplay, sorry) by a greedy toy collector named Al. Woody was part of a national craze in the 50's and Al just completed his collection. So it's up to Buzz and gang to save Woody, who maybe doesn't want to be saved. <br /> <br />What always makes Pixar films great is the heart: we CARE about these characters. When new toy Jessie tells her backstory of her previous owner, you can't help but sympathize with her. It's quite a delicate mix between story, character, comedy and even action and they still manage to pull it off. And we can certainly understand Woody's predicament: live forever in mint condition but never experiencing human touch ever, or experience a short-but-memorable childhood of his owner. <br /> <br />One thing that was really irritating me about recent Disney films is that who's-who in Hollywood syndrome, where big massive stars lend their voice. Do I care that Mel Gibson was in Pocahontas? Or Demi Moore in Hunchback of Notre Dame? Not really. Toy Story 2 has big names but we never get annoyed by the star power since they're good at their characters. Also of note is to some new people like KelseyGrammar and Joan Cusack for being believable and quite rambunctious on Joan's part. <br /> <br />I grew up in the era where computer effects hadn't started but that they were going to be a big thing. Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast had CG but it was very minimal at times. While it is disappointing fewer and fewer people are still doing traditional hand drawn animation, it's still quite something to see the power of CG and Toy Story 2 shows some of its potential. Backgrounds, color, detail are better, even the humans which didn't look great in part I. <br /> <br />One thing I am glad about is that we can still find previous films like Finding Nemo and A Bug's Life on stands unlike Disney which has its much-maligned \\"vault\\". I missed out on completing my Platinum series(so far) by not getting Beauty and the Beast and Snow White and now they're back in the vault. So while you can take your time with Toy Story 2, don't wait and just go get it and enjoy it.
0393327655|4.0|This book takes an extremely hardlined stance against faith. As a whole, I disagree with no major idea in this book. The primary problem is the author's use of emotionally charged words to get his point across. I think the point, cleanly stated, would serve better. <br /> <br />I agree, and have felt for some time, that faith is extremely detrimental to mankind, and so it was nice to read a book that agreed with me to such an extent. <br /> <br />That is not to say I didn't find many things to disagree with. But these are side issues (is torture ok? -- author: yes; is relativism a problem? -- author: yes; etc.) and if both the author and I agree on rejecting things like faith at the outset, I feel confident we could have a good discussion on the matter. The same cannot be said of the Pope, or my Christian coworkers. <br /> <br />Where I disagree with the author, the author has not set us up for an irreconcilable schism; and everywhere else we agree. <br /> <br />That would make it a good book to me. But why do I think it is a good book in general?  <br /> <br />The author has a case he wishes to present. He presents that case in general, and then tackles specific points as the book goes on. It has some similarities, in that respect, with another excellent book \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\" The author does not waste any time presenting the issue to the reader; with the main issue presented, the author then follows with specific issues and arguments. I could only hope for this kind of structure to permeate non-fiction works, even what are essentially opinion pieces (Al Franken could take note, though perhaps his books wouldn't be as funny).  <br /> <br />After the first chapter, you know what to expect from the rest of the book. If you disagree, bite your tongue and save the \\"yeah but\\"s for the end. So besides being a book I agree with, the author has written a book that can be appreciated by someone who disagrees, as well. <br /> <br />Again, its major flaw is in its useof emotionally-charged rhetoric. Such speech is incidental to the argument and could have been disposed of. No, such speech *should* have been disposed of, as it only serves to alienate the very people that need to hear the arguments the most.

0307276902|5.0|This book is an amazing read. James Frey has written an excellent book, regardless of all of the arguments surrounding weather it should be called fiction, memoir etc. I have a hard time finishing books that I start, and I couldn't put this one down.  I also recomend the sequel, My Friend Leonard.   I felt completely immersed in his world and in his head.  I loved every minute of it.  I am sad to have finished both books so quickly.  I am wondering what he will write next.

They walk the reader through the elements of this new paradigm offering stories to illustrate the points.  Well written, one can envision this as a conversation between friends.  It will be useful for take charge people.  It will not function well as a tool to force an organizaiton to change.  I find myself using the techniques to enrich all areas of my life.
B000005RT8|3.0|The CD was great of course it is McCartney. However, The CD case was cracked and scratched. It looked like it was returned and re-wrapped and sent out. It's not worth buying CDs on line if you are a serious collector that likes your CDs in good shape.
B00005NTN5|5.0|...with gorgeous dialog and split second timing.  Bound is well written and superbly acted with great cinematography; a seamless and original film with a touch of film noir and Alfred Hitchcock.   <br />Two women, Violet played by Jennifer Tilly and Corky played by Gina Gershon, work through an erotic combination of black leather, stiletto heels, and boys' underwear while taking the local mob for a ride.  At stake are two million dollars and a gang of humorless goons with psychotic tendencies.  The beautiful Violet is the femme fatal and the mobster's moll.  Caesar, played by Joe Pantoliano with a touch of Richard Widmark, is her lover/boss.  Corky is the girl in-the-apartment-next-door:  a stylish sexy ex-prison inmate who works as a Jack-of-all-Trades.  The two women find each other, and as their relationship moves from humor to tenderness to trust, decide to risk everything in order to escape.  <br />Instead of the usual clichs Bound resonates a Chicago that belongs to both the past and the present. A timeless cutting edge drama that is innovative, fun, and at times truly terrifying with plenty of action and some heart stopping moments and no way to tell, until the last two minutes, how it will end. First class entertainment delivered with style. Highly recommended.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000063UR2|5.0|First of all: I am from Europe and we can't get the Legend: Ultimate Edition anywhere here.  <br />After hopelessly trying to find it in any story, I bought it from amazon us and I am VERY happy, I did. The DVD is very good. It comes with the Director's Cut of Legend, which in my opinion is really excellent, because it shows the movie as it was intented. Lots of new scenes, for example Jack killing Meg Mucklebone nad having trouble with his sword at first. This really shows Jack as just becoming the hero, not already being it. <br />I never got to watch the US version of Legend, but on this DVD it was included, so I gave it a shot. I find this version a little strange and the Tangerine Dreams soundtrack does not add the athmosphere necessary for that movie, but it was interesting to see what movie the US audience saw in theatres. (Darkness with green glowing eyes and nails is VERY weird :) <br /> <br />The bonus content is satisfying. The making of ranges from Tim Currys problems with his costume to Mia Saras problems with the director, it all was interesting (although it would have been nice to hear some comments of Tom Cruise to this movie). The audio commentary from Ridley Scott is ok, but not too great. <br /> <br />The only letdown with this DVD is its cover. One DVD does not fit tightely into the box and keeps coming loose. And once the box is open, it can not be closed again properly. <br /> <br />But despite those box-problems I would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes the movie and especially to anyone who would love to have both: US an European version.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Very few television programs have had the power to establish such a large fan base as Firefly.  Joss Whedons best was unfortunatly his shortest series. The cancellation of this program has to be one of the biggest mistakes any network has ever made.  <br />The writing for this show is always excellent - not one dud. The interaction between the characters is totally believable and they really seem to love the work they do.   <br /> I have yet to meet anyone who has really watched the series who hasn't become a fan. <br />How this show cannot still be on the air is a mystery to me. It just gets better and better each time I watch it. If Firefly never makes it back to the small screen or as another movie, these few episodes will be treasured by many, many fans as the best televison has had to offer. Buy it, watch it, and I think you'll be hooked,  just like so many of us have.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I really can't say enough about this jewel of a movie.  Most of what I love about it has already been said:<br /><br />1) Absolutely fantastic characters that grow on you.<br />2) Incredibly talented cast.<br />3) Top-notch writing.<br />4) Hilarious, witty dialog.<br />5) A unique vision of the future, without all of the tiresome  SciFi cliches.<br />6) Great story & script with a perfect mix of action, drama, and wit.<br />7) Incredible camerawork(a la BSG) that draws you into the film.<br />8) Good FX (despite what the online BDI's say), especially considering this was NOT a big budget film.<br /><br />And this was all BEFORE I experienced the series \\"Firefly\\"!<br /><br />After renting Serenity, I bought & devoured the Firefly DVD's in just a couple of days.  I then bought and re-watched Serenity with a whole new appreciation for the movie and the Firefly universe.<br /><br />Sci-Fi purists that try to compare Serenity to \\"typical\\" Sci-Fi a la \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Trek\\" might be disappointed because Serenity/Firefly is not alien & technology driven, it is extremely character driven.  It's about the crew, their bond with each other, and their daily struggle to survive.<br /><br />Others may have a hard time with the whole Dramedy concept.  Drama and comedy can co-exist, and Serenity/Firefly pull it off seamlessly.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend both Serenity & Firefly and sincerely hope there is an enlightened network out there somewhere(SciFi Channel, WAKE THE HELL UP!) that will put this incredible series back on the air.<br /><br />How I missed it in the first place is beyond me, but I'm on-board now, and completely hooked.<br /><br />You should be too.<br /><br />(BTW, I also recommend the Serenity comic book/graphic novel and the book \\"Finding Serenity\\", both available on Amazon.  The graphic novel story-line takes place after the end of the series and leads into the movie.  The book is a great collection of essays written about Firefly and the 'Verse.)
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I must confess that I went into the theatre fully expecting to dislike this movie.  In the past one year, I have seen four literary adaptations (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire; The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants; and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe) and none of them has come close to doing justice to the books.  The magic of the story is always lost in the director's endeavour to commercialise it.  Therefore, I was very surprised to be absolutely delighted with this movie. <br />Having read the reviews before watching the movie, I knew that the story had been tampered with quite a bit.  But, perhaps because P & P isn't one of my favourite books, or because I've resigned myself to the liberties that screenwriters take, or maybe just due to my love for everything belonging to the Regency Period, I didn't mind that in this movie.  The setting is more rural, but that lends a more authentic feel to the film and really made it seem as if the story was coming alive on the screen.  The two lead characters - Lizzie and Darcy - carry forth the story with aplomb.  The spirited Lizzie and the proud Mr Darcy belong to each other right from the very first moment they lay eyes on one another.  Much credit goes to Knightley and Macfayden for portraying their roles so convincingly - they live their characters and so make us live them as well.  The other characters, like Jane and Mr Bingley and Mr Collins, were not perhaps quite as I imagined them, but they are relatively insignificant, as the movie belongs to Knightley and Macfayden.  The climax near the end was beautifully done.  There were also a lot of witty dialogues which made my brother - who, it must be confessed, has never read the book, because he finds it boring - enjoy the movie very much. <br />Some of the cinematography was wonderful; for instance, when they're dancing at the ball and after they've had their little battle of words, it seems as if they're the only two people in the room.  The sets were lovely - from rambling Longbourn to magnificent Pemberley - and the scenery was quite spectacular in some places.  The costumes were authentic, though I am quite certain women did not wear 'spaghetti straps' during the Regency Period.  But, overall, the feel was authentic and the period came alive as much as the story. <br />To conclude, I would have to say that 'Pride & Prejudice' is not on my list of favourite books - I think anything Georgette Heyer wrote beats it hollow - and I am a complete purist when it comes to literary adaptations, but, despite those two facts, I enjoyed this movie very much.  The director certainly deserves credit for managing to portray the magic of the story despite all the liberties that were taken with it.  A delight to watch - it will definitely be part of my DVD collection in the near future.
0393312836|4.0|Imagine a new solution for gang violence, where young hoodlums are \\"treated\\" in such a way that they are physically incapable of violence, for even a mere evil thought triggers pain and nausea.  With this new Ludovico's Technique, the streets will be safe again and the overcrowded prisons will be cleared.  Is this a panacea to street crime, or a coy government plot to impose its will on its people?    Anthony Burgess's \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is a compelling novel whose central conflict is between the human choice of doing good or evil and a mechanical imposition of doing good.  The novel begins in a dystopic world where young thugs rule the streets at night - thieving, raping, and mugging at will.  Although this may been a frightening idea for readers back in 1963, this sounds strikingly familiar for any major city today.  The proliferation of gang violence, insipid pop music, prostitots, and addiction to TV are mere facts of life today, so it may lose some of its edge for the modern reader.     However, Ludovico's Technique deserves a much closer examination.  It is this technique that forces Alex to be good, for any evil thought within him will trigger extreme nausea.  Although this renders Alex impotent and harmless, there is a much darker side to this, for it has robbed him of his free will.  Although he chooses evil, there is at least hope for him to reform, until he is programmed, like a robot, to do only good.  Indeed, this experiment has literally put the \\"Thought Police\\" inside Alex's mind, for at the first inkling of evil his body turns on him, overcoming him with pain and nausea.  Although the State claims to be doing this for the common good, this could obviously be used for more sinister purposes in an attempt to \\"condition\\" all citizens and punish them for subversive thoughts against the State. Although this never happens in the novel, the chilling possibilities remain.     Although this is a compelling novel, it is also quite gimmicky.  This book makesextensive use of an invented teenage slang - \\"nadsat.\\"  This no doubt is confusing at first, but it enriches the novel overall.  If this is too much, make use of the \\"nadsat\\" glossary.  This novel also inspired a campy 1972 British film.    Overall, this is a superb novel and presents a compelling moral question on free will.  Although the repressive government is a mere peripheral subject, its frightening possibilities of using Ludovico's Technique for mind control make this a thought-provoking, dystopic novel.

1581806574|5.0|This book not only appeals to adults but to children as well, and it is easy to follow.  I sat down with my 8 year old granddaughter and helped her to sketch a dragon. <br /> <br />I thought is was absolutely fascinating, and actually purchased it, not to draw dragons but to use it for creating a fantasy plush toy dragon.  However, once I saw the sketches and final product, I decided to tackle drawing a few dragons myself and just loved the details and overall look. <br /> <br />I am not an expert artist but found this book was written in such a way as it helped my art (of this type) look more professional.  Thanks, I would recommend it to anyone.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the first time I've been able to see all the episodes of Firefly.   It was a vastly underrated show and deserved a longer run.   The cast and crew did an excellent job on this production, and though some of the special effects were a bit cheesy, they are on par with those produced on other shows.   I really enjoyed the tension of seeing which way the captain and (somewhat) loyal crew were going to go in various situations.   The SciFi channel messed up by not ordering at least another season.

I've loved Johnny Depp since his \\"Jumpstreet\\" days, but normally he plays these over the top rolls.  Not this time, this time he's genuine and draws you into the story.  Kate Winslet is my favorite acctress in all the world.  She's magical and in \\"Finding Neverland\\" she doesn't disappoint.  This movie captures you from the first moment and by the end you feel like an emotional wreck (but in a good way).  I don't want to spoil this movie and give anything away.  I dont' want to take away your first magical experience with this movie.  Rent it or buy it, but you must watch it.  The experience will follow you for a long time after.

If you like the way the book is written, and you feel, as I do, that there were some worthwhile stories included in it, then the book is worth the money.  Whenevr I see the word \\"memoir\\" I asume it means \\"the way I remember things\\" and not that whatever is contained is precisely the way it happened.

B0009WFFS6|5.0|Overall it is a fine collection of performances taken from those historic evenings at the Royal Albert Hall.  When I hear and see Eric, Jack and Ginger play those songs from the past, I can only think of one analogy:  Fine Wine.  The sound is so refined and mature that it is hard to watch this DVD without a smile on your face.  The overall feeling is one of happiness and deep respect and love each shows one another as well as the music.  I purchased the Farewell concert and the differences between the two is large.  Before they were like young tigers, fearless in their playing and going at it with incredible pace and passion.  Now they are truly masters of their instruments as well as their level of musicianship.  We should all be very grateful that this reunion was able to take place.  It is a true gem to enjoy!
0307275639|5.0|There is a good reason why Ted Koppel considered his 3 interviews with Morrie Schwartz to be one of the major highlights of his entire career as a journalist and why he devoted much of his final broadcast to revisiting the legacy of this man.  Morrie's honest and unashamed portrayal of his experience in dying is positively life-changing for the living.  This book has helped millions to wrench themselves free from the oppression of their own break-neck daily lives, striving for things that will never satisfy, and in the process, losing those things that are truly precious and meaningful.  Morrie speaks with both the wisdom of a sage and the simple joy of the child-like soul as he shows what it really means to live, to love, to be human, to be free.<br /><br />The miracle here is that this elusive treasure is found in the loss of everything that once seemed important.  Morrie finds a new sense of purpose in the loss of vocation, new freedom in the prison of his own immobile body, true life at the doorway of his own death.  Morrie's thesis, \\"Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live\\" (82), echoes the sentiment of so many spiritual giants over the centuries.  \\"If...we can ultimately have that peace with dying, then we can finally do the really hard thing...make peace with living\\" (173).<br /><br />And how should we then live?  How do we find meaning and purpose and peace and joy?  \\"The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in\\" (52).  Morrie explains that we need others to survive, to be who we are, and the way we find meaning and purpose in life is necessarily in relation to others.<br /><br />Morrie's overly positive view of human potential is not diminished by the selfishness he sees in the world.  The world cultivates this problem: \\"People are only mean when they're threatened...and that's what our culture does. That's what our economy does. Even people who have jobs in our economy are threatened, because they worry about losing them.  And when you get threatened, you start looking out only for yourself.  You start making money a god. It's all part of this culture...which is why I don't buy into it\\" (154).  \\"The way to do it, I think, isn't to run away. You have to work at creating your own culture\\" (156). \\"Invest in the human family. Invest in people. Build a little community of those you love and who love you\\" (157).<br /><br />\\"So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning\\" (43).<br /><br />\\"Do the kind of things that come from the heart.  When you do, you won't be dissatisfied, you won't be envious, you won't be longing for somebody else's things. On the contrary, you'll be overwhelmed with what comes back\\" (128).<br /><br />\\"You have to find what's good and true and beautiful in your life as it is now\\" (120).<br /><br />We don't realize how bankrupt we truly are until forced to confront our own mortality.  How much better to confront it now, to discover what is really good and true and beautiful, to know real meaning and purpose in our lives, to know love.  Then we can actually LIVE before we die.<br /><br />I read many hundreds of books, and this one is very near the top of my MUST READ list.<br /><br />Steven MeigsAnd when you get threatened, you start looking out only for yourself.

B000BGH22W|4.0|I was disappointed to hear that John Williams didn't do the score for the forth in the Potter series, but I have to admit that Doyle, et. al. did a great job.  The music captures the spirit of HP4 while still being true to the themes originated by Williams in HP1, 2, and 3.  Some of the pieces are quite powerful, somewhat reminiscent of the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack (which is a must-buy).    If it were not for the three Weird Sisters songs at the end of the CD, I would have given it 5 stars.  But these three tracks seriously detract from the CD's overall appeal.  It's like mixing AC/DC with Beethoven; they both have their place, but not together.    Buy the CD then re-burn it to another disk leaving off the last three tracks.

It is easy to read and the scientific evidence the the author's conclusions were based on are compelling.  I am already feeling better.

B00008PC2O|5.0|First off there is the theatrical version on here. All you have to do is the following: Disc 1. On the Main Menu, highlight the words 'Sensory Control.' then press the 'Right' arrow key on your remote five times then the words 'The Future Is Not Set' will appear in Red on the right hand side. Now press 'Enter' and the Main Menu will switch to the Theatrical Version Menu. Now you can watch the Theatrical Version of the film. Thats all you have to do. Now for this film this has to be Schwarzenegger best film. It was like he was born to play this role. And the effects are great. The movie broke ground with some amazzing graphics and effects. The basic plot is SkyNet sends another terminator(the T-1000)back in time to destroy a young John Conner(the future leader to destroy the machines and skynet.)But in order to protect the young John, the John from the future reprograms another terminator and sends him back in time to protect him. Sarah Conner is locked up in a mental institution but breaks out with a little help of her son and the Terminator. But the T-1000 won't give up untill he destroys John. Great film and an excellent DVD. I wished there was more special features though.

I am a person who enjoys history books for the story-telling and not the accumulation of facts, and it turned out this book matched with me.  Gombrich picks some of the most entertaining and important stories in the world's history and delivers them in a playful fashion.  I particularly enjoyed reading these stories from a European perspective giving some stories an extra twist.  I can't wait to read this book to my children when they are old enough.   <br />I would recommend this book to any age reader without hesitation.

B0007P0LO8|2.0|I gave it 2 stars, the 2 being in reality a big 5 for the singing.  I bought this turkey before I read the reviews, then stupidly after I'd read them, I had a chance to return it for a refund but chose to watch it instead.  The music was glorious (except for the grunt during the \\"memorable dream sequence\\" (according to the box) that Puccini hardly wrote).  That said (I suggest as do others in their reviews that if you want this production, buy a CD, NOT this ghastly DVD), on to the rest of it.  The thing made both Domingo and Puccini look ridiculous.  Freni's \\"thoughts\\" were stupid (nobody else did it), the boy's hair was brown, not blond, Freni's teeth were perfectly fine, the little introduction (Domingo jumping through the wall and knocking people out of the way) was I suppose supposed to be modern or some crap like that.  Domingo did chew gum and wear a T-shirt.  Their lip-synching was good enough, subtitles were sparse so I got to look at their faces, but they didn't seem to be miming, though of course from the way it was filmed you knew they had to be (plus I'd been warned by those who know better).  It was supposed to have been filmed in color, but I watched half yesterday and half tonight, and woke up this morning thinking it was all in grey.  In fact that's all I can remember of it now.  I'm going to throw it away.  It's trash.  I feel I've been had (this sucker cost me $26 + shipping), I've searched everywhere but cannot find a good film of Butterfly.  Why?  The music is heavenly and the story is heartbreaking.  (I cried at the end of even this one.)  I want a conventional, traditional Butterfly performed the way Puccini and his librettists wrote it.  Is that too much to ask?  They do it with other operas.  One last word (except from now on I read reviews before I buy a DVD!!!).  The concept of this production conformed perfectly to the story.  Many unconventional touches brought home, brought out perfectly what the story was all about.  But it didn't work.  It was just lousy.  Oh.  And there sure was a lot of fog for spring.  Maybe someone else would like it, it was Butterfly after all (except for the grunt during the \\"memorable dream sequence\\"), but I sure as hell didn't like it.  Now to the garbage with this.  Yeah.  I'm so damned rich I can afford to blow $30 on Freni, Domingo, Ludwig and Karajan and come up with a piece of nonsense like this!  Thanks a lot.  Reminds me 30 years ago when I trusted another hero of mine and wound up having the bejesus scared out of me watching The Omen.

0739307312|5.0|I rarely read fiction anymore, usually preferring nonfiction these days, but I made an exception for this book because of everything I'd heard about it. I'd also read Holy Blood, Holy Grail some years ago, which it's said Brown's book is a fictionalization of. So religious thrillers aren't exactly my cup of tea, but I found Brown still created a fast paced, interesting, and well-done story that's a lot better than the vast majority of other novels out there. I also found Brown to be a competent writer who knows how to put together a well-crafted mystery. Overall a fine book and I look forward to seeing the movie.
B000BYA5G4|4.0|This movie is in many ways a first of its kind, and in many ways it isn't. Lord of War deals with gunrunning, something I've never seen in movies to this scale. For that, I have to give this movie one extra star. But at the same time, this movie has a lot of similarities to Blow, by forcing us to cheer for the bad guy who is doing nothing but contributing to the destruction of the world. Only instead of cocaine, the Lord of War deals in AK-47s.<br /><br />This movie follows the story of Yuri Orlov as he first discovers the profits to be gained in dealing in black-market weapons, and then as he learns the dangers of continuing in the trade. Though surely an intelligent man, he's also one-sighted; all he cares about is how and who to sell his weapons to, or how to gain more weapons at cheap prices. Hell, the day his son first walks is also the day the Cold War officially ends. Do you think he'd be excited about the first steps of his son? Nope, he cares about the massive surplus of Russian weapons left behind because of the ending of the Cold War. Despite all that, he's able to avoid Interpol for years on end, and gets himself involved with one of the most legendary and evil dictators in history, Andre Baptiste.<br /><br />This is a movie of screwed up moral issues. Yuri gets into your head during this movie, and we believe that, though he wants war, he doesn't want death. If he had it his way, he would wish for all the weapons he sold to \\"miss\\" there target. And he's just such a lovable character. He risks his life daily for what he believes, no matter how off-base those beliefs are, and wants nothing more than to continue supporting his family. He's obviously intelligent. And he's funny, in a morbid sort of way.<br /><br />In the end, though, this is a movie of acquired tastes. If you have no interest in guns (like me), or do not wish to glorify them, then this obviously isn't the movie for you. But if you have a high tolerance for things such as this, then get Lord of War. It's a good movie with a style all its own, and one based off of true events.ie with a style all its own, and one based off of true events.

B00005JOFO|5.0|I am up way past my Bedtime, But two days ago I saw a film that literally sunk \\"The Titanic\\", Titanic, I saw five times in the theatre.  I got the Broke Back Mountain C. D. after checking to see if Amazon was selling it, like the 1960's, this movie has not even hit my semi large town in the midwest BiBle Belt,and I had to drive 55 miles to see it.  This Midwest town , Basically has the same rules and attitudes aBout a Gay theme movie and gays, like  Ennis and Jake , I am gay, I know. But in this town, gays won't even hang out with other gay men ,out of fear of Being Beaten.  I hate that and it made the film so real to me.  Heck, I'm lying awake in Bed, Because I am thinking Ennis is a real person and I want to take him in my arms, and let him know it is okay to have a same sex partner.  As far as I can see, I have not seen a performance of that magnitude, since Charese  Theron  in\\"Monster\\"  Keith Legder made Ennis real, so real,it seems like I could reach out and  touch him.  I listened to the Soundtrack, which I hope gets the Oscar.  But what amazes me,is the fact that we have had gay love stories already like \\" Torch Song Trilogy\\" and \\"Angel's in America\\" and even \\"Making Love\\" with Harry Hamlin in the 80's.  What I think the society has done over just the last few years,  has pushed Back years of Being accepting and comfortaBle with gay individuals.... and that Breaks my heart.  And now all over again, it is time to come out....Be  re-examined.  I hope the Movie wins all 8, I keep hearing the part with the soft guitars in my head, each and every time the movie wins an Oscar. Copote..too easy for that guy.  I felt every tightness that Ennis had in his lungs, in his heart, and in punishing himself for expressing his feelings.  I don't like the ending.  I do Believe if Jake( Jack) could have waited a few more months, Ennis would have made the move.  I cried three times.  My favorite part is where they see each other after 4 years and they are so happy to Be with each other,they kiss unashamed and it's muskrat love!!MAGIC... on the steps to the house, where Ennis' wife could see. It made me cry.  That is love, gay or straight. I know those feelings of a long awaited distance romance and they did that so well.  They worked so hard.  I am haunted and forever will haunted(in a place in my heart) until I find that sparkplug romance.I am alone at 47, like Ennis Delmar  KEITH LEDGER .....geez... when he opened the closet with the Blood stained shirt and the Blood that ran through the shirt of Jack's...almost too hard to take ,it was his little shrine,they were Blood Brothers... his \\" Love that will never grow old\\" even now as tears well in my eyes.  Keith Ledger deserves the Oscar, he really worked that character.  And Besides all that , the panoramic mountain ranges gave it the air.... that Being gay needs to Breath .

0930289528|5.0|I first ran across Alan Moore with the (probably) more popular \\"Watchmen,\\" which my girlfriend was reading for a graphic novels class. At the time, I was getting through the last quarter of Neil Gaiman's \\"Sandman\\" series, and between the two an interest in graphic novels was sparked in me, so I decided to check this one out. <br /> <br />Most of V For Vendetta is drawn by David Lloyd, and his generous use of shadows and low-key, dark colors perfectly fit the dark enigmatic environment of the graphic novel. While he doesn't balk from delivering the necessary violence, the gore is never overstated and doesn't take away from the true aim of each violent scene. Basically, violence and explosions abound, but not the show-offy cheap thrills action movie kind. <br /> <br />VFV is about ideology, and Moore doesn't forget that. V is a towering, superhuman psychotic, less a person than an idea; obsessed with delivering Freedom to the masses, even knowing he is no leader. Meanwhile the \\"bad guys\\" are often sympathized with--some of the opressors are shown to be some of the most opressed, themselves. We are frequently treated to \\"behind-the-scenes\\" looks at characters; their public fronts unmasked and their inner works beared to us. <br /> <br />The graphic novel does what it sets out to do, and keeps one interested throughout. Clever and engaging writing abounds; I personally believe this is Moore's magnum opus.

0553804367|5.0|I bought the book A Brief History of Time back when it was knew to paperback - everybody did.  I never actually got around to reading it and neither did everybody else.  After a while, I just figured that it was outdated, so I didn't bother.  Now that A Briefer History of Time is out, I bought it on audiobook and listened to it in my car.  I figured I had better do it before it too becomes outdated. <br /> <br />Like many adults, I have let my scientific knowledge slip.  This book is written for us.  Now that is not to say that I understand all the concepts in it.  Actually, I have just finished listening to it for the first time.  I figure that, if I keep on listening to it, it will sink in.  Equations are kept to a minimum and everything is explained as simply as possible - which, in some cases, is still quite complicated. <br /> <br />This is a good introduction to the state of science as it is now.  One of the things that surprised me most - something that most scientists don't like to admit to - is how much we DON'T know.  In fact, some of our most important theories (Newton's and Darwin's) are in direct conflict, and yet we use them both. <br /> <br />I wouldn't say that this book tells you everything you need to know about science.  What it does is get you to a place where you can understand the concepts and begin to do some research on your own.  If you are not an expert, don't worry about it.  One of the most fascinating points the book makes is that - since the eighteenth century - it has been impossible for one man to have a thorough working knowledge of science.  There is just too much.  Scientists must all specialize in one narrow, limited field to become an expert at anything.  That makes me feel better about myself.    <br />
B00005U2LM|3.0|One can't help but compare this album to the Wu's previous, more generally accepted efforts; however, this one stands mostly on its own. Iron Flag shows both an evolution and an internalization of the Wu sound: the traditional Wu-Tang sound has come to an experimental point, and whether one likes the album or not really depends on one's own taste. None of the tracks are inherently bad; rather some just may be harder to get into than others depending on the person. By all means check it out, but if you're a Wu beginner, start elsewhere.

Nothing comes close in teaching us more about ethics with a little history and some action thrown in for fun.   <br />My husband received the 2nd season for the holidays and we got hooked and had to buy the 1st and 3rd season.  We've recently finished watching the end and I am sad to finish it.   <br />Remind yourselves how great the show is, entertaining, and educational to some extend for your children.
B000A59PMO|5.0|\\"Veronica Mars\\" is not a very well-advertised show.  There's little chance I'd have bothered to investigate it had Joss Whedon not raved about the show on-line.  I decided that I had nothing to lose by giving it a shot, so I went out to Best Buy and picked up the first season.  That was, without a doubt, one of the finest decisions of my young life.    \\"Veronica Mars\\" centers on - surprise! - Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell).  Veronica's a high school junior living in Neptune, California, a town populated almost solely by the rich and famous.  Veronica's family is neither rich nor famous, but they may be a little infamous.  Veronica's father, Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni), runs a detective agency and was, at one time, Neptune's sheriff.  That was before the incident that changed Neptune and its inhabitants forever - the murder of Veronica's best friend, Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried).  When the murder occured, Keith Mars accused Lilly's father, billionaire Jake Kane (Kyle Secor) - a move which resulted in the Mars family being shunned by the rest of Neptune and the departure of Veronica's mom, Lianne Mars (Corinne Bohrer).  Now Veronica has devoted her life to clearing her father's name, while dealing with life's many hardships - as well as the negativity from almost everyone around her.    I was absolutely mesmerized by this series from the moment the pilot began.  The acting is flawless.  Kristen Bell is just wonderful as Veronica, and Enrico Colantoni is terrific as her loving dad.  Jason Dohring is perfect as Logan Echolls, Veronica's friend-turned-tormentor, while Teddy Dunn plays the part of Duncan Kane, Veronica's ex-boyfriend, very well.  The writing is witty and very clever, not to mention unpredictable - this series is just full of plot twists.  When Lilly's killer is at long last revealed, you won't see it coming.  There's also a fantastic soundtrack, including a magnificent score by Josh Kramon.  To top it off, the show's lighting is noticeably unique and really makes the show seem all the more great.    Try as I may to review this season, I really cannot find the words to describe the brilliance of this show.  It's been compared to \\"Buffy\\", though I think that if anything the show resembles \\"Twin Peaks\\"; truth be told, \\"Veronica Mars\\" is one of the most unique shows to hit TV in the last decade.  (God bless you, Rob Thomas!) I can rave about this show endlessly, but to know what the show's really like you've gotta buy it.  I can promise you that you will adore this series.    Never has a first season of anything been so wonderful as the first season of \\"Veronica Mars\\".  This is sweet, sweet television perfection, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone.    TOP 5 EPISODES OF THE SEASON    1. Leave It to Beaver  2. A Trip to the Dentist  3. Clash of the Tritons  4. Ruskie Business  5. Pilot
0316168815|3.0|The basic premise of Alice Sebold's most famous novel is (in my opinion) the reason for its success. A girl is murdered, and watches from heaven as her family and friends continue on with their lives without her. Such a hook is so unique, so fascinating, so painful and poetic that it's no wonder that this book has been a bestseller. Unfortunately several flaws in the storytelling mean that the tale itself doesn't always live up to the golden premise (and often the prose is awful!), but ultimately \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a poignant and unforgettable read.<br /><br />Susie Salmon tells the story in first-person narrative after her death. At fourteen years old she was lured into an underground cavern, raped and killed by her neighbour Mr Harvey - now she watches her family cope with her disappearance, her presumed death and the years that follow her passing; all the time desperately longing to be amongst them once more.<br /><br />She watches all her family from above (her parents and her siblings), as well as other friends, acquaintances, pets and various objects that go astray; the boy she first kissed, the friend who felt her passing, the detective investigating her case, her missing charm bracelet, her dog and  - most importantly - the man who took her life. As she watches time passes; her mother handles her grief by having an affair, her sister Lindsay falls in love, her grandmother returns to take control of the family, and her little brother - too young to understand or even remember Susie's death - grows up in a world without her.<br /><br />Sebold nails the family dynamics; the fear, anxiety, horror, guilt and grief that comes with the death of a family member, as well as the denial, pain and surrealism that follows as they gradually adjust to her absence and the anniversary of Susie's death approaches. Susie's father's guilt, her mother's detachment, her sister's anger - all are captured to perfection. Nothing will ever go back to normal for the Salmon family, and things are churned up further when Mr Salmon begins to suspect Mr Harvey was involved in his youngest daughter's death. The haunted memories of the family are wonderfully balanced with moments of transcendence and beauty found in life; giving the sense that both life and death are not that far away from each other.<br /><br />Sebold's treatment of heaven was (in my opinion) unsatisfactory, with her only original idea being the thought that each person gets their own personalised heaven - Susie's is a high school and playground. But beyond this, her images of heaven seemed quite flat; there is no mention what it actually feels like to be in heaven, what revelations and inner knowledge one might gain and (strangest of all) no mention of God at all. Susie is focused entirely on earth-bound matters. This of course was Sebold's decision, as an author she perhaps simply wasn't interested in exploring the heaven-side of her story, but I felt that it was oddly lopsided to focus so much on the life of Susie's family rather than what heaven is like.<br /><br />With the exception of Susie herself, the most vivid character is Lindsay (though perhaps this is because I'm also an older sister) who goes through the coming-of-age that Susie missed out on. It is Lindsay who Susie is most interested in watching from heaven, riveted by her changing form, her growing love for her boyfriend and her deep-seated sadness at the death of her sister. Out of all the characters and storylines portray, it is Lindsay and her quiet struggle that was most memorable to me. Creeping through Mr Harvey's house, running through the rain with her finance, visiting the scene of her sister's death - Sebold is at her best when dealing with Lindsay.<br /><br />However, the second half of the book is severely weakened as Sebold changes in tone too drastically so that she can fit in a rather strange episode concerning Susie and her first crush. Sebold tries to compensate for Susie's missed maturity, but ina way that feels as though it belongs in a different book, which also takes much of the bittersweetness out of Susie's heavenly existence. It wouldn't be fair to give it away to those that haven't read it; but those that have finished the book will know what I'm talking about and scanning over some other reviews I can see there was similar disappointment at the conclusion. (However, the last paragraph is so poignantly beautiful I almost forgive her for the previous misstep).turity, but in a way that feels as though it belongs in a different book, which also takes much of the bittersweetness out of Susie's heavenly existence.

B000AARKOO|5.0|I really cannot wait for this to come out.  I am extremely confident that it will be at least 10 times better than the origianl version (and it wasnt that bad).  I think people are going to be blown away.
B00009W0U4|4.0|Disturbing, rivoting, sometimes hard to watch.  The beginning of the film is difficult to focus on clearly.  Eerie camera work.  A wonderful gut wrentching expierence.  Believe me...once is enough.  Okay, maybe twice.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I got this album for Christmas last year, and I have listened to it at least 5-6 times a week since then. Yes, I am the type to get addicted to music that I really like.  <br /> <br />First of all: This album IS different then Green Day's previous stuff. I have Dookie and some of their other stuff as well. Though those were good CD's, especially Dookie, American Idiot completely blows past them. If you didn't like Green Day's earlier stuff, don't let that deter you from checking this out! <br />If you did like Green Day's older stuff, I am still sure you will like this, just be aware it is not the same pop/punk as before. <br /> <br />American Idiot is unique in the way that most of the songs are instantly likable, yet they don't grow old after 5-6 listens. I have literally heard most every song on this album (the exception would be Wake Me Up When September Ends, not too into that one) over a hundred times each. This is especially the case with the two \\"ballads\\", Jesus of Suburbia and  Homecoming, as they have so many tempo changes. They are basically 5+ songs each. <br /> <br />I would classify this as punk/alternative. I have considerable experience with both genres (in response to a certain review below, I own Never Mind the Bollocks, and I still think this is punk...) and this takes the best of both of them and combines them into one awesome album. <br /> <br />If it has any impact, this CD has been out around 2 years now. It has won a Grammy and 3 of its songs have gotten MAJOR airplay. I mean, I change the station after Holiday is done and the station I turn to is in the middle of it. However, unlike most music that gets airplay on major stations, this is NOT pop. Not even close. This is pure, politically charged punk.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, this is one of the greatest albums to come out in quite a long time. People will be talking about this and listening to this for a long time to come. <br /> <br />Pick this up as soon as you can, and enjoy!
B000002BPS|5.0|Ignition, Smash, and Ixnay are their three best. If you don't want to believe me, take a look at the other reviews on this site. I'm glad to see that most people seem to agree with me on this.  <br /> <br />Ixnay is essentially Smash with some experimentation mixed in. Songs like Mota and Me & My Old Lady are a bit \\"weird\\", and I think this is why some people don't like them, but both songs have really rockin' choruses. Me & My Old Lady has that annoying ball & chain refrain, sure, but it also has the great Offspring surf guitar sound.  <br /> <br />I give this album five stars because of two songs, \\"Gone Away\\" and \\"Amazed\\". These songs are more than just \\"slow stuff\\" to balance the fast songs. \\"Gone Away\\" is an emotional wringer. If you can listen to a song about loss and let go, and not feel sappy, you will love this song. It is a simple song musically but it is a classic. \\"Amazed\\" is much of the same, but is a little less strong.  <br /> <br />The rest of the songs in this album are Smash-style rockers, but less strong overall with uninspired tracks like \\"Cool to Hate\\" and \\"Way Down the Line\\", which may be entertaining lyrically, but are musically un-interesting.  <br /> <br />I would strongly recommended that anyone, not just pop-punk fans, listen to this album. This music isn't just for kids. The Offspring is pretty much the only band that I listened to during my high school days that I still listen to now. You'd think that a CD like Ixnay would get old. but it hasn't, because this isn't your run-of-the-mill pop rock.
0060229357|5.0|I had this book when I was a child - my favorite.  I gave it to a friend, an elementary school teacher, when she had her second son.  She had never seen the book and asked how in the world I had found it.  The book, she said, was her son's favorite book.  Now I am getting it again for my daughter.
076790592X|5.0|I could read this book over and over and never get tired of the simple messages that abound within its pages.  ALS (more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease) is a horrible illness to deal with, but the optimistic way in which Morrie approached the final days of his life is a testament to how we should all live.  Mitch Album expertly displays the importance of living each day to the fullest and not taking anyone for granted with this piece of work.
1594200696|5.0|I was delighted to locate this book, given that it dates back quite a while. English grammar continues to deteriorate, with misuse of apostrophes and lack of understanding of many basic precepts. this book had been mentioned favourably in a column in the Irish Times, by Frank McNally, a few months ago. I felt that it would be appreciated by my brother, who is a grammatical purist. On reading through it myself, I discovered quite a few helpful directions with regard to writing style, that I found most helpful. I recommend it to anyone who already has a grasp of English grammer and wishes to polish it up. You will find a well illustrated book, set out clearly, which puts complex material into a clear format. The various examples of what not to write, versus what to write, made for further ease of learning.
0743454537|5.0|Once I picked this novel up, I had a hard time putting it down. I finished it in two days (and I work full time and go to school, so imagine that)... The story line is intense, and the dynamics between Anna and her family members is very realistic... You will LOVE this book!
0375815260|5.0|This is the very first book I had ever read.  And then I read it again for a class book report.  Not being a very good reader at all and, for the most part, faking it all through school - I loved everything about this story.  I was disappointed with the Gene Wilder movie and much more disappointed that Tim Burton had made assumptions about Willie Wonka that I didn't believe were true in his movie.  Older now, with children of my own, I've purchased this book and the Glass Elevator for my daughter who devours books unlike I ever had and, thankfully, more like her mother does.  She's heard the story read to her in class, but she is enjoying it on her own now.
B000BVD460|5.0|Eminem once again proves his worth as an artist in the World with this incredible album.  His music is heart-felt and soulful, with a particular track (\\"Without Me\\") that is just one of the most beautiful pieces of work I have ever encountered.  Highly recommend.
B000002U82|5.0|Toro: Say Pancho, if Cranky hates Pink Floyd then why does he come here. Pancho: I think he is jealous that a reviewer he hates is heading back into Top 1000 for the first time in awhile! Toro: Anyhow, Dark Side of the Moon still sells year after year, decade after decade, etc. Pancho: I still hear songs like Time, Us and Them, Money and Breathe on the radio here in Mexico and in America toos. Toro and Pancho say if you don't have this album, BAMINOS PRONTO to the store and buy it and keep it on the charts for a thousand more weeks!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I saw this DVD at a store over the holidays, found it for a lower price on Amazon and bought it.  It is a must have.  I was a HUGE Zeppelin fan in the 80s, but never got to see them perform.  Watching this DVD brought a whole new light to their music being able to watch each of guys do their thing.  The DVD has performances from several different years and even a demo video doing Communication Breakdown.  It is neat to watch them evolve through the years.  I highly recommend this DVD to any fan.

B00004SCX6|1.0|Toro: Pancho, I am so sick of this Brittaney Speers mamacita! Pancho: She was one airbrushed teenager who has now turned into a tramp! Toro: This mamacita didn't even write her own songs(like the awful title cut, Lucky and Stronger which are all as bad as a contaminated cucaracha), they was all penned by a Swedish cucaracha Max Martin and the result was bubble gum at it worst. Pancho: Her cover of The Rolling Stones' Satisfaction is the musicla equal to someone crashing their car into a tree at 100 miles an hour and dying. Toro: This record sold less than her debut with only 10 million sold in America. Pancho: This gringo's career was starting to slide. Toro and Pancho say save your pesos and purchase The Best of The Tijuana Toads instead and avoid this music prostitute.

B0007GAEGC|5.0|They all have haunting voices.  Very soothing.  I listen to this as great background music when I am trying to concentrate on projects at work and get something truly accomplished.
B000000W5B|4.0|Well the ride ended folks. After four years where the Stones could do absolutely no wrong, they released their first less than classic record. 'Goats Head Soup' is still a wonderful album and a semi-classic but it cannot rival the four (or five including 'Ya-Ya''s)before it in terms of undisputed brilliance. Jamaica was the place in late 1972 when 'Soup' was recorded with longtime sidekick Jimmy Miller producing (this would be his last Stones). The voodoo of the Carribean seemed to influence at leat two of the tracks and the weird album inset (and title). Key cuts include voodoo leadoff \\"Dancing with Mr.D\\" a great song with haunting lyrics and driving groove. \\"Angie\\" is brilliant and well deserving of the respect and could be their greatest love ballad. \\"Doo Doo Doo Doo\\" was the other hit and while quite good, it pales in comparison to other Stones hits from the early seventies. \\"Star Star\\" is a riot and very punk in its attitude and honesty (what is a groupie anyway?), love the pop culture references and \\"tricks with fruit\\". \\"Winter\\" is another unbelievable ballad and almost rivals \\"Angie\\", great leads from Mick Taylor. The rest of the album is kind of mediocre, although Keith's \\"Coming Down Again\\" has its moments (\\"slip my tongue in someone else's pie\\"). \\"Silver Train\\" is a poor man's \\"All Down the Line\\". Buy 'Soup' if you are a diehard Stones fan but buy any of the previous five records first then you'll understand my rating. Yes a classic for some but not up to the astonishing success of the 68-72 era. Afterword the Stones' jetsetting lifetyle would catch up with them as well as Keith's addiction and the Stones would mostly struggle for the rest of the decade with less than stellar recordings....that is until 'Some Girls'. <br />

B000BJS4F8|2.0|Being an Alanis fan, or a former one, I recommend you not to buy this album if you have already purchased her previous ones. Basically the album contains the exact same songs in the previous albums; i thought she would revisit some songs and make new versions of them, which didn't happen. So, do yourself a favor: don't waste your money. <br /> <br />As for the DVD, it is the only good thing about purchasing this. But still, it is not worth the money.  <br /> <br />Bad career choice, Alanis.
6304884419|4.0|This was the third film in 1993 that had De Niro as a major character, the others being \\"Mad Dog and Glory\\", and \\"This Boy's Life\\".  Here we have his first directorial outing.  It was a very good film, and another about a teenager choosing a life, but it was  rather violent.

B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta is a difficult band to classify.  In sporadic fashion, they display a distinctly Latin vibe (similar to Santana), venture into prog experimentalism (not unlike Pink Floyd), bear the mark of post-hardcore punk rock (in the same vein as former outfit At the Drive In or their colleagues Coheed and Cambria), take part in pseudo-tribal percussion breakdowns (Rusted Root-styled), and even move forth in jazzy time signatures and meters (sorry, can't really think of a similar artist for this part).  And this is all in just one song.  All hyperbole aside (although it's not exactly exaggeration if you're telling the truth), the Mars Volta are by far one of the most innovative and sublime bands in recent memory.  Guitarist / producer Omar a Rodriguez-Lopez and vocalist Cedric Bixler Zavala (both hailing from the now-defunct At the Drive In) have truly outdone themselves on this release, but the host of other musicians who contributed to this album is by no means shabby.  Jon Theodore keeps everything rhythmic and precise with his ample percussion skills.  Ikey Isaiah Owens and Jeremy Michael Ward lend the already superb music an atmosphere that is at various times eerie, gentle, or downright weird.   Hell, the inimitable Flea even plays bass.    The strangest thing about this album is that it all falls into place with little to no trouble.  Kicking off with the rather sedate \\"Son Et Lumiere,\\" the listener is at once lulled into a false sense of serenity.  The relative calm is abruptly shattered by jagged guitar outbursts at the end of the song, which lead directly into \\"Inertiatic ESP.\\"  By far the most popular (of course this IS the Mars Volta, so we all know it can't be THAT popular) and straight-forward (ditto) song on the CD, \\"Inertiatic ESP\\" features some extremely high-pitched vocals, quite different from Zavala's singing with At the Drive In.  He sings \\"Now I'm lost\\" in his brilliant upper register, thus showing his diversity, vocal-wise.  The first halfof the song maintains this fast pace and relative frankness for a couple minutes, until it veers off into a slightly experimental, jamming section.  After returning to its original theme, the song begins its spacey transition to \\"Roulette Dares (The Haunt of).\\"  Not as immediately memorable as anything else on here, \\"Roulette\\" is rather unorthodox in style.  Somehow, though, it is still catchy and will grow on you, and before you know it you'll be humming \\"Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed\\" to yourself.  As you've probably gathered from that simple quotation, this band's songwriting is...well...imaginative.  Wordy and creative, the album's lyrical content is at best cryptic and at worst indecipherable (and I mean that in the most positive way one can).  Anyway, the song leads into the short instrumental \\"Tira Me A Las Araas\\" (literally \\"It throws me to the spiders\\"), an altogether work of filler with an Eastern-esque guitar part.    \\"Drunkship of Lanterns\\" revives the album, showcasing a distinctly Latin flavor yet keeping a hard rock edge.  The drum work in this song is phenomenal to say the least, and really backs up the rest of the band well.  The song pretty much keeps up the momentum it had from the start, culminating in a very Santana-esque guitar solo about two thirds of the way through.  The song ends appropriately, with the percussion fading into mysterious rhythmic white noise.  This continues for about a minute, then gives way for \\"Eriatarka.\\"  One of the most well-written songs found here (and with this lot, that's really saying something), the song starts off rather mellow, then builds to a rather Latin-themed, almost funky chorus.  Flea's bass really shines here.  After the first chorus, more space noise, until the second verse, identical to the first (structure and melody-wise, not lyrically) paves the way for another build up.  The second chorus leads into a bridge of sorts, where Zavala sings \\"Evaporated the fur, because it covers them,if you only knew the plans they had for us.\\"  Again, interesting songwriting.  The song then turns slightly mellower, until a very dramatic buildup to the third and final chorus.  After this, another bout of high-pitched singing followed by more spacey white noise continues for a little while.  Then it hits.  \\"Cicatriz ESP\\" is considered by many (myself included) to be the best song on the album.  A steady rhythmic section propels the song through its lengthy first verse, then drops out suddenly.  After a few seconds of silence, helicopters can be heard in the distance, and we reach the simple yet effective chorus, consisting entirely of \\"I've defected!\\"  The song follows this pattern once more, then yields to another guitar solo, which gradually dies down and then gives way to an entirely synth instrumental passage, kind of like something one would hear on an early Pink Floyd record.  While some find this part of this song to be overlong and tedious, I think it builds the tension nicely, especially when the true \\"song\\" returns, this time accompanied by a very Santana-influenced guitar line.  For another chorus the song presses on, then slowly dies down.  \\"This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed\\" is probably the worst song on the album, but its bearable, and has a few saving graces (including Zavala's melodic screams of \\"Anonymous!\\")  This song kind of pilfers out, as though it was trying to capitalize on the richness of \\"Cicatriz\\" and then realized it failed.  It's good, just not THAT good.    At this point, \\"Televators,\\" a breather of sorts from the hectic ambitiousness of its predecessors, takes the spotlight.  Entirely acoustic, the song is another highlight of the album.  Despite its simplicity, it holds its own very well, and retains the signature Mars Volta sound.  Zavala's vocals are prominent on this song, and nowhere are they put to better use.  After six or so minutes of acoustic meditation* (*used loosely), the song ends with a variety of soundscapes, the mostrecognizable being that of a warplane dropping a bomb.  Soon, \\"Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt\\" opens with a loud clash of distortion, leading to a staccato, slightly polyrhythmic main riff.  The verses in this song are nothing special (save for the lyrics, including the wonderful line \\"slice up and not across\\"), but the band's musicianship really shines of the pre-chorus and chorus.  Soon a bridge passage pops up, and the song fades to a rather (intentionally) flimsy melody played on an instrument that I can't properly identify.  Soon a bit of keyboard crops up, followed by a messy yet defined percussion backing and then a bass solo.  The song then takes a more relaxing turn, with sporadic high pitch wails echoing from the guitar.  These outbursts then form a melodic statement, until eventually the guitars take on an entire different texture yet carry on in the same melodic vein as before.  Zavala gently croons \\"oooh\\" overtop the increasingly frantic and distorted line, until it kicks back into the same bridge passage that led into this section.  It then evolves into a very rhythmic closing section, where Zavala sings \\"Who brought me here, forsaken, depraved, and wrought with fear, who turned it off, the last thing I remember now, who brought me here?\\"  The song, album, and entire musical journey that it came hand in hand with, then comes to an abrupt and tragic halt.    As a whole, the Mars Volta's \\"Deloused in the Comatorium\\" is a great experiment.  A fusion of very disparate styles, a debut album like this only comes around once in a great while, and these guys manage to accomplish this feat like experienced pros, which is exactly what they are.  Although At the Drive In is extremely different than the Mars Volta, some of their stylistic tendencies are similar.  They both feature drastic time and meter changes, and both rely on unconventional melodies, hooks, and lyrics to establish their point.  The lyrical theme for \\"Deloused\\" is about a man named Cerpin Taxt who attempts suicide, fails, and then spends the majority of the album in a purgatory of sorts, exploring the world inside of his mind and soul.  Apparently he doesn't like what he sees, because by the end of the CD, Taxt finally \\"takes the veil\\" and ends it all.  Not a very pretty scenario, but leave it to the Mars Volta to pull this concept album off and not sound heavy-handed.  Sure, the song lengths may bother some, but more often than not, those who don't have the patience to listen to an entire song are not deserving of any of the song's beauty and epic scale.  And that's exactly what \\"Deloused\\" is: an exercise in beautiful epics, justifiably grandiose and irregular and yet ultimately powerful.    God, that was a long review.

B00000099Y|5.0|I am a fan of Chevelle and bought this album becuase of the Amazon recommendation. This was an excellent buy and I liked it immediately.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Where to start with this review (Updated Review).<br /><br />I purchased this from Amazon because it had long been rumored that the original production of Dune filmed so much material that they could slice and rescast this movie into several adaptations.  Rumors of a 4+ hour adaptation abound and I have to admit, I saw a very long version of this movie on television but I think they just added commmercials to make it long.  Nonetheless, the promise of getting to see some of the previously unseen footage was enough to make me buy.  An interview on this extended DVD set clears up the mystery that there was never enough footage for 4+ hour version --- however this new release does include never before seen footage.<br /><br />I'll tell you what I like about the original:<br />It made me think.  I was a teen when I saw the original movie and I hadn't read the book at that time.  I must say, this movie in its original form forced me to think and read into characters.<br /><br />When you see the original movie, the director did a phenomenal job of adapting the book to a movie and once you read the book you'll see the hard work that was put into this movie in its original form.  Lynch dropped subtle details into the movie that added to the mythology like small comments on thinking machines and how they were frowned upon etc that really made you wonder about this world.  The Orange Catholic bible etc.  Few movies out there and few directors were so careful to add so many small details to this work.  I don't know if Lynch was ever happy with the production but his efforts came through loud and clear to me.  However, due to the volume of work, the audience had to be an interested audience (this is not a hang your brain at door movie)....you have to watch everything and listen to everything because most things have a meaning.<br /><br />About the Flaws people see with this movie:<br />Many people think its incomprehensible....You have to understand that the book Frank Herbert wrote is genius..  It bespeaks of the second coming of Christ only 10,000 years in the future.  The book is over 500 pages and then there are several additional books written by Herbert in the series that create a whole mythology around the world he created.  This is allot of ground for an audience to cover in a couple of hours.<br /><br />To add to this, you have to be versed in Science Fiction, Medieval Feudal Europe, The Catholic Church, Physics, Politics, Current Events (Intifada issues) & Middle Eastern Affairs, Mecantile Europe, Medieval life at court, and have an open mind & inventive mind and knowledge of several other areas.<br /><br />If you don't care for those topics or don't have time to know something about this, then this movie regardless of how they recast the movie, it will be incomprehensible and I recommend you steer well clear of the books as well.<br /><br />On the other hand, with a bit of reading and an open mind, this movie is reachable to most every 15 year old with a basic Western Education.<br /><br />About this Extended Edition ---<br /><br />The good:<br />Getting the opportunity to see some previously unseen footage is worth the price of admission for this extended edition.  They did a good job in knitting the whole story by reslicing the material.  However, I would definitely call it somebody's else's Dune because the recutting definitely gives it a different feel and flavor.<br /><br />The case is slick and exactly what I would expect for a release to a global fanbase for what could be one of the greatest stories ever told.<br /><br />The extended edition is anamorphic widescreen which is a nice treat.  There are some cut scenes that are nice but no commentary or any nicer features that I could see.  They did have some nice interviews on how they did it, special effects, costumes etc that were a nice contextual extras.<br /><br />Now for the Bad:<br /><br />Some people did not like the original cut of movie and in response the studio,I think, tried to make this rendition more comprehensive by making extended edition in the hopes of engaging a wider audience....the original problem remains -- how to feed 6+ hours of details and content into 2 or so hours.<br /><br />In The old movie Urulan introduces the movie perfectly and then you cut to a simple communication between the \\"guild\\" which has them send a navigator to \\"demand\\" from the emperor details.  That original introduction was perfect....then you'd cut and see Urulan walk by as the Navigator arrived at the Emperor's palace.  An interraction between the Emperor and the Navigator shed so much light to the original movie and most of the context you need to get through it.<br /><br />In the new adaptation, you start off with an overly long cartoonish explanation that indeed doesn't shed enough light to really state what is at the heart of the problems the imperium faces (details that Lynch expertly peppered into the original with a casual comment here and there already).  Albeit this new intro has some very engaging cartoons, I think its still best to say less and force the audience to think...all the cartoon does is destroy mythology...but don't get me wrong, I appreciate the hard work they did in extending the movie and showing us more.<br /><br />Overall, I think the original movie where Urulan introduces the movie and then the cut to her at court in the original movie is perfect (not to mention that she's gorgeous....gorgeous princess introducing vs voice of some guy?) ---- even the sci fi channel adaptation ends with a beautiful fadeout where Urulan is left alone.  The original can't be beat.<br /><br />On packaging, I would've expected 2 or 3 CDs to go with the gorgesous case for the fans....but instead we get a single CD that you flip to get both versions of the movie.  This should've been 1 original, 1 extended, 1 extras CDs. It seems like they paid for the case and skimped on the CDs...I would've paid $29.99 for better packaging and extras.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Not everyone likes all movies and this one is no different.  I am a believer as other reviewers have noted that Dune is a \\"love it or hate it affair.\\" Indeed I have found this to be the case.  First you have to get this movie and then you have to apprecite it.  Many people don't even get to the \\"getting it part\\" for whatever reason....because they're turned off by sci fi, the graphic gothic nature of some scenes, or don't know about the various topics you have to know about etc.<br /><br />Personally, I think this extended edition is worth buying just for the extra scenes and some of the special featurettes.  I am however, still a huge fan of the original rendition and prefer it to this extended edition, the extended tv edition, and the sci fi channel miniseries.  I'll visit Lynch's Dune over any other to date.a wider audience....the original problem remains -- how to feed 6+ hours of details and content into 2 or so hours.

0446677450|4.0|Kiyosaki is very successful at demonstrating the difference between how most people look at making money versus how the rich do.  He stresses income generating assets, self-reliance, risk taking and taking responsibility for your own success rather than relying on a company, pension, government or other handout. <br /> <br />The only thing that annoyed me about the book was that he repeats himself a lot even for a self-help book & he pushes real estate as if it was the only way to make money. <br /> <br />Still if you are looking for a pep talk to get your engerized to invest more agressively then this is a good bet.
B00005MP58|5.0|I am very pleased with this product.  The DVD's are very clear and there is only one noticable stutter in one of the dance scenes.  I had already seen this rendition of Pride and Prejudice and loved it, I was not disappointed with watching 4 hours of it all at once!  I didn't even really notice it was 4 hours long, I didn't want it to end!
B00011F5DK|4.0|This game is fun for all ages.  Best if played with four people.  Easy to learn and can be played in a short period of time.
0060899190|5.0|I loved this book. It shows you what others keep as their deep dark secrets. Some are happy, others silly, and others the same as many other people. It was a very comforting read. We are not alone and all hold secrets, it is just more fun to read other peoples than have to dwell on our own.
B000AADYRQ|3.0|It's alright. There are a few songs that really stick in your heads and a few evoke emotion but a lot of it seems too cheery for Death Cab. Also too polished. I liked Transatlanticism a lot more. Not a must have but if you can get it for...less...than full price you probably woulnd't regret it.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I've seen the Eagles life in 1977 in Frankfurt Germany. An experience I will never forget!!!! When I've learned about this DVD I couldn't wait to purchase it. It is by far the best concert I've seen in my life and it is great to see that despite the \\"ups and downs\\" this group has truly recovered and I will definetly enjoy this for a long time. You don't have to be an Eagles fan to love it!!!! Two thumbs up!!!!!
B00006FM77|5.0|Want a classic concert compact disc package from a band that gives everything they have to the pop rock listening world?  This item is it!  Chicago is at their absolute best in this great offering by Rhino.  This item is worth every penny spent on it, not only because of the great live Chicago music, but also for the great packaging that Rhino puts into this product.  And don't forget that a prevously unreleased bonus disc is included!  The band explodes with its hungry youthful early 1970's energy here.  And in my opinion you will not find better bass guitar performing than by Peter Cetera on any other live performance EVER recorded.  Another very noticable treat on Live At Carnegie Hall is the incredible guitar playing of the late Terry Kath.  This is a must have live selection for the fan who wants to hear a truly great legendary band at work!  Chicago aims to please here!  Get this!

B000002NZO|5.0|After the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, this recording is Genesis's most creative.  One word of warning: this recording isn't the best sound quality and the players are young musicians playing WAY beyond their experience (which is part of what makes it so exciting--these young musicians are really pushing the boundaries of contemporary rock).  While the recording and performance is not perfect, it is inspired.  Just put on the headphones and listen to the 12 string guitars in counterpoint to organ and piano--throw in a little flute, some electric guitar, melodic bass, and Peter Gabriel's poetic singing, and you can see everything that made this band and most of it's musicians, famous down the road. <br />One problem on this CD compared to my old LP version: what happened to the big ending on \\"Stagnation\\"?  For some reason, somebody decided to do an awkward fade-out on the end of this tune....Strange...
B000268QB2|3.0|I got this album because I totally loved the singles that came out, Somewhere Only We Know, This Is The Last Time, Everybody's Changing and Bedshaped. When I listened to it the first time after I got it, I didn't like it that much but I still don't regret that I bought it, because it was 50% off and it cost me about $8.<br /><br />There are only 2 songs out of the singles that I like: Your Eyes Open and She Has No Time. The other songs are almost the same all the time and it's quite boring. Still, they said that their 2nd album would be with more instruments, I hope that their new songs are better than these.<br /><br />If you just want to buy it because of the singles, you won't like it, believe me.
B00000AOUD|5.0|I've been a modest Jethro Tull fan over the years, collecting a number of LPs, from Minstrel in the Gallery through War Child and Songs from the Woods.  Somehow, I was only remotely familiar with Thick As A Brick in my younger years.  Recently, after reading Amazon reviews, I decided to purchase TAAB.  Whoa!  This CD has the most complexity and spirit of any Jethro Tull recording--it's the only JT recording that I have been extremely excited about and can listen to multiple times.  Almost symphonic in arrangement, its 2 parts (really one, but the old LP format forced division into two), themes and bits of themes are revisited and recombined in new ways throughout.  Various styles are also blended, but are essentially \\"Tull\\" in sound and style. But even beyond the complexity of weaving of themes, what makes this recording special is the energy behind it.  These guys went into the studio inspired and created the recording with the assistance of some magical muse.  Actually, 1970 through 1973 seem to have been very special years in rock music.  Some of the best \\"progressive\\" and non-progressive rock from Genesis, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Elton John, Allman Brothers, Cat Stevens Yes (the list goes on and on) came from those years.  Add Thick as a Brick to that list of great rock recordings!    One comment on a previous review quoted here:    \\"The rise and eventual implosion of Jethro Tull is a classic cautionary tale of the late '60s and early '70s, replete with hype, hyperbole, bloated egos and budgets, and super-inflated delusions of musical aptitude.\\"  I think what the above reviewer is referring to in a negative way could, as an alternative, be seen as MUSICAL CREATIVITY!  In the late 60's and early '70s, musicians were breaking musical norms and expectations and some great music resulted.  Sure, there were bloated egos and budgets, but \\"delusions\\" of musical aptitude?  I don't think so.  It was just great music.
B000066NW0|5.0|I love this album! It's excellent, all the songs are amazing, specially Nobody's Fool, Losing Grip, Sk8er Boi and Complicated. I loved this album the very first time I listened to it and as in my city there were no more copies I encharged it from Argentina and it really really satisfied me and I think this is an excellent debut album by Avril Lavigne but I still believe that that her 2004 album is even better...
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I'll preface my review by saying that I am only passingly familiar with the play Rent. Before watching the movie, I had been turned onto seeing it after listening to the music from the Broadway show, but I have never seen the play actually performed. As such, I can't really comment on how this film stacks up to the play, only how it stands on its own as a film. <br /> <br />What strikes me about Rent early on is the very good acting by all of the cast. For most of this, I can chalk it up to experience with the characters; most of the original cast of the play makes it into the movie and thus they have 10 plus years of working with their parts. However, even the new additions are very well acted. The characters of Rent live a carefree Bohemian lifestyle, but there is still an incredible sadness within them. Most of the cast has AIDS and is doomed to die in a very painful manner. Those who do not have AIDS live with the knowledge that they will have to watch as their friends die. For most of the film, those emotions go unstated, but they are clearly in the background for every character. <br /> <br />A solid example of this sadness on the inside comes through during the song \\"Another Time,\\" when Mimi flirts with Roger and he pushes her away because of his fear of opening up to someone as he dies of the virus. In a very angry song, he breaks down for a moment and begins saying softly, \\"I should tell you, I should tell you...\\" only to explode in anger again. The performance is very subtle, but Roger's pain remains evident in his voice even as he keeps it hidden. The characters are as real as fictional constructs can be; they do not simply feel happy or sad or angry. They carry around a mix of emotions, and the actors portray those mixed emotions as they try to have a good time in what are potentially their final days. <br /> <br />The music of Rent is obviously one of the highlights of the film. Although many songs have been cut out from the play, probably due to the time constraints on a film, the important ones are still there and they still sound terrific. If anything, the cast has improved in their musical talent over the years, and the wide variety of quirky and beautiful songs written by the late Jonathan Larson are all performed to perfection. The music remains important to the plot, advancing the storylines and highlighting all the key moments of the film. <br /> <br />Rent is a movie that covers all of the emotions that a person would realistically have when they are facing something as powerful and deadly as AIDS. The performances are sharp and the music is terrific. This is a film that will move you from happiness to anger to sadness and back again, covering everything in between along the way.
B000099T2L|4.0|Certainly, Beyonc&eacute; made a very well done album if we're talking about production, lyrics and creativity. But, the point of having an album that the poeple will like is that an album should have good rhythms and sounds. In this album, the style she used can be very compared to Destiny's Child's albums, but I personally don't like what she did with songs like Signs, Hip-Hop Star and Work It Out (hidden bonus track). These songs give me the impression that she didn't know what else to do, so she recorded these songs with poor music and dumb lyrics.<br /><br />The rest of the album is very good, and there are songs that I never thought I would like that are now my favorites. I really love The Closer I Get To You, a very slow and relaxed song that makes you enjoy the moment when you listen to it. Other song I liked a lot from this album is Dangerously In Love 2. The original Dangerously In Love, part of Destiny's Child's \\"Survivor\\" album was more boring and slow, with only a few instruments.<br /><br />Beyonc&eacute; Knowles did a good job with this album, and other thing I have to say is that she chose the singles very good. It's a very recommended album to the people who like the album \\"Survivor\\", but it's not something you should buy if what you're looking is an album with excellent songs.
B000063WDH|4.0|Butt shaking music.  If you like bluesy rock you'll love this.  Not as refined as there 3rd Cd, much more primitive.  Drums and guitar.  Play it loud.
B000002UAU|5.0|It has been dubbed \\"The most important rock album of all time\\" or even \\"the greatest album ever\\". But while those quotations might be true, this is not an album I would let a newcomer to the Beatles listen to. Why? I think those new people might have bad impression on them and not understand what is so important about the album. I would rather give them Rubber Soul or Revolver to start them out with, and probably their last album should be this one. But this is just advice for someone who hasn't heard of the Beatles. <br /> <br />But back to Sgt Pepper. It's almost been 40 years since this album was released, and still it is just amazing. Sonically it is profound, it's quite an achievment on its own becuase of how technical the sound is. The music is of course revolutionary, it became a staple becuase no one really thought rock music could be made into an art form, but the Beatles accomplished it. When Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys was released, it was an album of melodies and had alot of influence on the Beatles, espically Paul McCartney. But rather Sgt Pepper was also trying to compete with that album, and The Beatles did and surpassed it. Although I wouldn't compare both those albums. <br /> <br />Let's look at the individual songs that makes this album a masterpiece that should be in everyone's collection: <br /> <br />1. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band <br />The opening track. In the beginning you can hear the crowd settling down, and many of the instruments getting tuned up. This is what Paul wanted, a sort of fictious band to start playing. It is a great track, that definetly makes you want to listen to the rest of the album. <br /> <br />2. With A Little Help From My Friends <br />One of the great things about Sgt Pepper is its cohesivness. From the title track into this song, it flows very smoothly. But the original tracklist of songs had to be rearranged to fit on side A of the vinyl. The original tracklist was never changed on the CD version to whatthe Beatles intended it to be. It doesn't really hamper the music. Anyway, this is one of my favorite songs that Ringo Starr singed. It speaks of Ringo how he is lonely, but gets by with a little help (and some drugs!) from his friends. A great melodic tune. By the way, Ringo is called Billy Shears, again to reiterate that The Beatles were trying to play as a fictious band. <br /> <br />3. Lucy In The Sky Of Diamonds <br />A very creative song by John Lennon, which he is creating this surreal visual in your head as he is singing the song. He actually got this song from his son Julian who painted a girl from his class called Lucy. Julian explained to John about what it was about, and that she was in the sky with diamonds. But many other people believe that the song title has the initials of LSD and this song is a LSD trip. <br /> <br />4. Getting Better <br />One of the greatest songs of all time. Incredibly catchy. Paul is great in this one, along with John backing him up with extra vocals. George Harrison's use of the sitar is a very nice touch. <br /> <br />5. Fixing a Hole <br />Here's another one by McCartney, another fantastic melody and range. An awesome guitar bridge by Harrison. <br /> <br />6. She's Leaving Home <br />Probably my favorite from this album, it tells a story of a girl who is running away from home. Paul came across a newspaper article that said a girl had been missing for weeks, and her father saying she had everything. So he wrote this song. This song is composed of all string instruments. Sgt Pepper was also a first with using a 40 piece orchestra, but was dubbed to sound like a 160 piece was actually playing. <br /> <br />7. Benefit For The Benefit of Mr. Kite <br />This one is probably my least favorite on the album. It's a good song, but I just don't like it as much as the rest of the album. All of the songs on Sgt Pepper were actually taken from everyday life, most of them were written from outside inspirations. Lennon found a poster that came from 1843 that announced a circus was coming to town. All the lyrics in this song, came from that poster even the stunts they did. It's also a pretty neat song because it sounds just like something you would hear at a circus too. <br /> <br />8. Within You Without You <br />The sitar used in this song, accompanied by a violin, is so beautiful.  Harrison was studying under Ravi Shankar who taught him how to play it. The sitar was also used in songs like Norweigan Wood and Love You To. This song speaks about eastern philosophy. <br /> <br />9. When I'm Sixty-Four <br />A playful song by Paul, who wrote this for his father. He actually wrote this melody when he was only fifteen. It's a humorous song, that is uplifting to hear. <br /> <br />10. Lovely Rita <br />Another one of my favorites. I love the intro to the song, and the instrumental and melody is awesome. <br /> <br />11. Good Morning Good Morning <br />Lennon wrote this song based off a Corn Flakes commercial, who later called it a piece of garbage. But I disagree strongly, I love his vocals in this one, and Harrison's roaring guitar solo is great. The animal noises at the end are very cool. <br /> <br />12. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise) <br />I love this song. Sure its short, but Ringo's opening drumming I like alot. The Beatles needed something to close out the album, and George Martin, who produced Beatles albums, wrote this one. <br /> <br />12. A Day In The Life <br />This song is pretty mindblowing. It's a very sad song that Lennon describes a death of a friend, and then the orchestra builds up a crescendo that sounds like something huge is going to happen. Then it goes into Paul's verse, which was actually from an unfished song he was working on. The John comes in and sings another verse at a bit faster tempo, then the crescendo begins again. But Lennon wanted something that sounded like the end of the world. At the end of the crescendo is actually four pianos striking down on the same key, to create the effect. <br /> <br />Well that's it for my Sgt. Pepper review, I hope you enjoyed it or learned something new about the Beatles.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Stevie Wonder, as a composer, singer, and musician was simply at a creative peak during the 70's. I would recommend anything he put out during that decade.<br /><br />'Songs in the key of life' is one Stevie's most accessible, and at the same time innovative albums. Like the albums that came before it (innervisions, talking book, etc) SITKOL strikingly combines an optomistic driving groove with some of the sharpest social and political criticism you will find in popular music.<br /><br />Some of the better known tunes are \\"sir duke\\", 'I wish', 'isnt she lovely', and 'as' - but the other tracks are all good!
B000A3DFZE|5.0|I think this album features some of the best music he has ever done. It has a smooth sound - smooth blues. I would like to see more music produced like this.
B000AP04OM|5.0|No matter how many times I have seen this movie it is great it makes you laugh and happy  and even sad. The songs always make you feel young again and the happy ending makes it complete <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly - the Complete Series is an excellent DVD set. It is a great SciFi series with wonderful twists and turns. Refreshing and original. I wish the series would return to the air waves. I am a Browncoat and hope you will be too.  <br /> <br />Also recommend Serenity the Firefly story continued in a full length movie.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Those of us who've tasted good Jamaican rum know it's golden color is the essence of sunshine, it's sweetness from pure sugar cane and it's mellowness a good reggae song; it's smooth and complex taste stays in your mouth a long time, and this is what this CD reflects.  <br /> <br />The youngest of the Great Bob Marley delivers music to please all, from social protest to dancehall tracks, using his dad true and tried formula. Educate and entratain. Only he goes a step higher fusing reggae,hip hop and rap to the musical mix. <br />   <br />Songs like 'Confrotation' or 'Welcome to Jamrock' not only speak about Jamaica's other reality but he could pretty well be talking about other socially repressed countries or ghettos around the world, replace the words weed and Trenchtown with the name of the drug and town of your choice. He also adresses the ever increasing problem of addiction in a sad and melacholic way in 'Pimpass Paradise' and fusing oriental vibes and electronics talking about dysfunctional families in 'For the babies'.  <br /> <br />And although his critics claim his trying to show only the bad side of his country he proves them wrong, songs like 'Beautiful' feat. the long lost Bobbi Brown or 'Hey girl' with the kick ass line of \\"Hey Junior you're a genius, you think with your mind and not your penis\\" deliver sunshine and beach from the first to the last note.  And the song 'All Night' could be something Sean Paul and the english reggae school sings to kick start a party. <br /> <br />And no one like Gong Jr. could give 'Exodus' a new life,'Move' has rap that blends smoothly with the original brass section and gives the message of Movement of Jah People 21st century social meaning.  <br /> <br />And like good Jamaican rum this CD stays in your mind (and feet) long after you finished listening to it, making his daddy proud.
B000021Y77|5.0|One evening I found myself watching this movie on cable TV simply because there was nothing else on.  Within 10 minutes, I was captivated and amazed at this film.  It works on so many levels. It is totally European in its script, filming and overall look and feel.  Now I am not necessarily a fan of European or Asian filmaking, but this movie goes a long way to opening my mind to the potential of foreign films.  Which is not a bad thing, considering some of the dribble being made in the US of late.<br /><br />This is a moralistic tale, yet it gets the message across that the split-second decisions we all make in our lives set off a chain of events that can result in dismal and irreversible endings.  But the film has fun doing it.  One cannot help but be drawn in by the simplistic plot (and the basic plot itself is simplistic, though the various end scenarios are the height of creativity) and wondering what Lola is going to decide to do next.<br /><br />At times I found myself wanting to yell out \\"dont' do that\\" or \\"Lola, no!\\" which of course is ludicrous but signifies how wrapped up I became in the misadventures of this young German couple.  I've not felt the urge to talk back to a silent screen since childhood, but this movie had me rooting all the way for Lola (even though there are serious crimes involved) and totally wrapped up in the basic story and its varied endings.<br /><br />I like the fact that this is a European film shot in Berlin and with a soundtrack composed of the type of music that people in Europe (but not necessarily here in the US) seem to enjoy.  Even without any foreknowledge of the location, one knows immediately that this is NOT anywhere in North America.  This aspect only adds to its appeal as one of its many attributes is to give us a glimpse into the European mindset, at times familiar but still distinct enough to generate interest.<br /><br />Kudos to the actress who, if not a marathon runner, should certainly consider becoming one.  If she wasn't in great physical shape at the beginning of filming, she most assuredly was at its finish!  I never realized that the very act of running could convey so much to the audience--we are constantly \\"running\\" all during our lives; not in a physical sense, but rather our movement on the road of life.  We run to, or away from, different situations, but there is no escaping the fact that we must make important decisions and learn to live with our choices.<br /><br />This film rates 5 stars--I can find nothing wrong with it, and a lot that is right.  Moralistic and entertaining at the same time, it reminds us that we are ultimately in charge of our destinies.  We can chose to blame Fate, or a God or whatever we wish, but when all is said and done we have no one else to blame (or applaud) for the place in the universe we have carved out for ourselves.one.  If she wasn't in great physical shape at the beginning of filming, she most assuredly was at its finish!

Moralistic and entertaining at the same time, it reminds us that we are ultimately in charge of our destinies.  We can chose to blame Fate, or a God or whatever we wish, but when all is said and done we have no one else to blame (or applaud) for the place in the universe we have carved out for ourselves.
0792839749|5.0|Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang, starring Dick Van Dyke, is classic children's entertainment.  With the humorous, eccentric grandfather, highly amusing inventions by the father, the dog riot set off by \\"toot-sweets\\", and the flying car, there's a lot of room for fun and adventure.  On a higher scale, analogies can be made between the evil king and real bad guys in modern history, making this movie educational.
B000641Z90|5.0|If you are a Phil Collins fan, you have got to buy this DVD set.  I'd attended the Farewell concert and recently bought this DVD just to repeat the fatastic experience of a world class performace.  The concert was so well planned and performed, you can see everyone on stage was giving evertyhing he's got.  The overall atmospher was so well prestended that there was not even one second of dull time durning the entire 2+ hours of concert.  I also like the additional videos from thoes hit songs.  Another good source of good memory.  Easily a 5 start winnner.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Those 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers are absolutely hilarious. John Cleese and the whole team give a superbly funny performance, exploiting all aspects of comic (character, speech and situation comedy, mime...). <br />To be watched again and again, every time you need to cheer up or enjoy a GOOD laugh.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Never heard of Joss Whedon or Firefly before the movie Serenity came out.  The previews to the movie had me puzzled; who is this \\"creative genius\\" they advertized (I don't normally watch much serialized TV).  Really enjoyed the movie and bought the TV series.  Great stories and characters.  Went through the whole video series in about three days, and enjoyed them all.  Have done repeat viewings (re-runs?) and really enjoyed the special feature interview with Joss and cast.   <br /> <br />For those with sensitive tastes, there are many scenes with overt sexual themes (some partial nudity, simulated intercourse), and a lot of violence (but not gratuitous and not overdone or too explicit).
0307276902|5.0|A very courageous writing.  A real life look at the life of addiction.  I would highly recommend anyone and everyone (over 17 years of age) to read this book . . . whether an addict or not.  Because the book is written in a very casual form (without quotations and proper sentences), one must keep an open mind.
B000AAP7BM|3.0|In my opinion, not his best.  I much prefer 33, Todos Los Romances as far as singing, mood music and Luis Miguel at his finest!
B000AP2ZDK|4.0|Man what A Shame to here that Jay Dee died of the Lukemia virus I believe it was. The guy just turned 32 on 2/7 and Died on my 21'st Birthday. He had a great thing on the Hip Hop circle and I even saw some videos he produced on MTV and BET. Instead of playing the crappy artist such as D4L and Dem Franchize Boyz they got to play some of his stuff. Man we will never forget you all the true Hip Hop Believers. As for the music it is a Instrumental album an is pretty good it is not the greatest beats he ever produced but it is sure to sell pretty good as it should because he died of a terrible Dissease and he was a very talented producer to. Rest in Peace J-Dilla
B000009ROK|5.0|Excellent, great listening, romantic and totally Luis Miguel at his finest.  If you like this one - you will also love 33.
0790729350|5.0|I purchased this DVD so that I would have a bit of history in my music collection.  The performances on this DVD are all collectors items from Richie Havens to The Who. <br /> <br />Anyone who lived through the 60's and 70's will remember the political protests against the war in Vietnam and the drug culture which are evident in this DVD also.
B00005KARK|5.0|I think that it was a very good movie.  I watched it with my 5 year old nephew and he enjoyed it also.
B000000XCH|5.0|It sounds as clear and crisp as it did when I was 13! It's Great!
0440238609|5.0|I took the three books on a trip to China and the Philppines. On Boracay,a beautiful tropical island, I got a really bad sunburn because I had my nose in a book and didn't pay attention to the increasing redness of my skin. <br /> <br />There were so many fascinating ideas and points of view among the pages that I had to frequently stop to let my mind catch up.  Was that a problem? Not at all! Intellectual stimulation can only make me a better person...
0553583182|5.0|I was a bit skeptical at first, but as I began to read the chapters of the book I realized the great truths and powers that were held within my subconcious mind.  I put the book to the test, I did exactly as it said, and it worked.  I have used the book to increase my confidence in public speaking and seen my subconscious mind work wonders.  I have used it to aquire a new ipod that I never could have afforded before hand.  This book is continually changing my life and I recommend it to everyone in the world.  It can truly give new life to your life and engage you in a tool you never knew existed.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|I knew when I was watching the movie that Perhlman was playing that violin.  He has a style all his own.  There is no one who can make a violin talk like Perhlman.  Then to find out that Williams was the conductor!  That made it perfect.  The Pops has never been the same since he left!!!  The music is so good, you can almost \\"see\\" the movie through it.
1573301183|5.0|One of my all tim favorite acoustic performances, Alice In Chains made a triumphant return the stage in a mind blowing performance.  Lane Staley's powerful yet meager voice is entrancing.  Backed up by Jerry Cantrell the band is at the peak of their abilities in this dvd.  All you Alice fans out there, if you don't already own it, order your copy now.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Excellent adventures, pretty people, and great music! The series has heart and is entirely captivating!
B00005MP58|1.0|This DVD was not in good form (did not work).  I returned the DVD requesting a new copy.  I was informed that you are refunding my money less a discount.  I have requested info as to why the refund is not for the full amount and have not heard anything.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Phill Collins es uno de los artistas ms influyentes de los aos 80's. A muy buen precio este CD tiene un correcto resumen de su carrera, si bien tiene los temas ms comerciales.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best series I have seen in many years, because the people in the show behave like real, normal people you are with every day, which may be why you feel like they're \\"family\\".  It's a science fiction, western-type futuristic series.  I HATE science fiction, I HATE westerns, I can watch some futuristic shows, but this series is all three and I LOVE it!!  It must be the cast, because you feel like a real part of the show when you watch it.  It is serious, but funny.  It's different, interesting and inviting, which is extremely hard to find these days.  It has something for everyone.  I have loaned this series to many friends, and most of them have purchased it.  I would recommend this to everyone!  This show had a crummy time slot when it came out, but the following since it was put on video is overwhelming.  They did try to tie up some of the loose ends in the follow-up movie, \\"Serenity\\", but I can only hope that they will continue the series from there.  Don't miss this one - it's original, new, different, and in a class by itself.  You WON'T be disappointed!!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|My Dad was a big Johnny Cash fan so I was exposed to it in early years-good news for music loving parents-you do influence your kids ears.  I love Cash because he reminds me of my dad, then I saw Walk the Line, left the theatre and bought 5 of his CD's all of which I can recommend but \\"The Man Comes Around\\" is so suberb- so sadly beautiful, so passionate in the selection of songs to the point of being autobiographical.  Cash covers it all- his regrets, his happiness, his pure love of his wife June, his rebellion, and his immense faith in God. He hits all these feelings and more in \\"Hurt\\".  The title song creates a story in your mind complete with color and \\"spielbergesque\\" special-effects.  \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", arguably one of the most beautiful songs ever written, is delivered by Cash with his age coming thru in his vocals that leaves only one word coming to mind- wisdom. And the juxtaposition of the very young Fiona Apple singing ever so slightly behind him (in measure and as back-up) - brilliant.  You must own this album and might I suggest: do what I do- listen to it with your sixteen year old.  They'll love you for it and I think, respect you for it. <br /> <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I recently watched this movie, and even though I'm not the biggest Final Fantasy 7 fan, I still found this to be an enjoyment from start to finish. I'm neither a manga fan, but reguradless, I didn't fast forward a single second of this movie. The fight scenes were jaw-dropping, and if graphics are your things, watch this movie with a few changes of pants on hand, because you're gonna need em' when you see these graphics (I'm no computer expert, so graphics is as far as my computer literacy goes when it comes to this sort of field). If you were a fan of the game, you'll be pleasentley suprised to see things like materia, limt breaks (omni-slash makes an appearance, insanely cool at that) and of course, summons (well, A, summon to be more specific, but it gets the job done). <br /> <br />The story was actually pretty well done. I remember reading, \\"... the geostigma is destroying the world...\\" and thinking to myself,  cheesy... But, the guys over at Square-Enix manage to pull off a concept such as that without making it, well, suck, for lack of a better word. Rene and Rude are in it, and provide some quality comic relief. Every playable charcter from the game is in it, and they all have their unique personalities along with them for the ride. Overall, I found this to be a suprisingly delightful experience, and when it is released in the US, I'll happily part with twenty bucks for it.
B000008LOV|5.0|How could a collaboration between legendary performers Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne, George Harrison, Tom Petty and Roy Orbison possibly fail?  Well, don't answer that.  Such works often collapse completely under their own weight.  The Traveling Wilburys proved that it can be done, and it can be done extremely well. <br /> <br />As many people have already pointed out, it would be easy for the egos of the superstars involved here to get in the way of the talent.  For whatever reason, that does not happen.  This album is a perfect blend of the talents of each individual.  Every song has little touches of George/Beatles, ELO's Jeff Lynne and his orchestral sounds, Tom Petty's southern-styled guitar, Dylan (you know what I mean), and the unique vocal and musical stylings of the late, great Roy Orbison. <br /> <br />Something as incredible as this doesn't happen often.  For each Traveling Wilburys there are groups like Asia that were overflowing with talent and great expectations but failed to live up to those expectations (I like Asia, don't get me wrong). <br /> <br />It's simple.  If you like the music of any one of these individuals, there is no excuse for not scaring up a copy of this album.  Actually, there is one reason.  It's evidently out of print and it's not easy to find a copy for a decent price, especially on CD.  So, there's no excuse for not buying a copy if you can find one for a reasonable cost.  I paid $9 for a nice copy on vinyl, and it's well worth twice that.  This album is just fantastic from start to finish.
0060930349|5.0|This has been a most surprising opportunity to enjoy the history of our society as seen through the eyes of a British historian.  The author admittedly is a strong admirer of the American people and he encourages the reader to be just as supportive of the society in which we live.  He supports his view by giving the background of the various stages through which our society has grown as well as giving some insight into the personalities of those who guided our journey.  We are a rugged strong society and we did not get here by way of the route detailed in the history books that I studied going through school in the 1930's and 1940's.  Alas, maybe Washington did not cut down the cherry tree after all.
6305907145|5.0|As a devout Jane Austen fan, this movie was very satisfying.  It is a wonderful portrait of the novel and enhanced with dramatic yet tasteful cinematography, colors, and music.  Austen's sharp wit and controversial social issues of the time are ones that are still alive today.
0321344758|4.0|This book presents clear and consise information that will help improve your web site more than increasing your rank in Google will ever do. Why? Well, if you a user gets to your site but doesn't know what to click or where to find the information they want, then they'll leave. Don't Make Me Think gets you thinking in the mind of the user about how best to present your site in order for users to get the most out of it.  <br /> <br />It's not a big book and you could probably summarise its contents in a few pages. However, it is an enjoyable read and contains lots of useful information with plenty of colourful pictures and diagrams.
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is my favorite among Jane Austen's work.  I was skeptical when this movie came out, because I enjoy the mini-series by A&E, but the music made me fall in love with the movie.  The music is powerful on so many different levels and is its own character in the movie.
B00068NVI4|5.0|I loved this concert. I have been a life long fan and have seen them live at least 10X.<br />You will hear some of the classic pieces rendered acoustically as well. I cannot imagine any true Yes fan being disappointed with this one.<br />The only thing I cannot decide is who looks older on stage, Yes or the Rolling Stones!!!
B000053V7Q|5.0|I was never one of the screaming, crying, groupies who crowded around a star touching and tearing their clothes etc. But I loved Elvis Presley. His voice could make my toes curl. Still does and I'm an old lady. I have probably seen all his movies, bought most of his albums and followed his career from day 1. I own several video's and DVD's of his movies and lately have been buying the \\"outtakes\\" such as this Special Edition. I think I like these better than the movies. It gives a very good picture of the \\"real\\" person. His sense of humor and the way he interacts and responds to those around him. His friendliness. I loved the way he sometimes \\"messed up\\" on the lyrics and then just went right on singing as though it was part of the plan. I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to see the real person behind the KING'S image.
0375805613|5.0|I have loved this book since I was a kid.  Growing up it was one of my favorite books.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Excellent!  The music is perfect with full orchestra and the voices are crystal clear!  The harmony is excellent between all the woman.  I have watched the DVD several times and it is great for all ages to enjoy.  Would make a perfect gift for anyone.  I would hightly recommend this DVD.  I also bought the CD for use in the car and at work.
0895260131|5.0|Highly informative and alarming. Gets beyond the PC of this administration.
B000002U9L|5.0|I have been a Jim Henson fan since I was young.  It's sad that I was never able to see Labyrinth back during it's prime but I did however become attatched to The Dark Crystal.  Now that I am older, I finally bought Labyrinth.  And three hours later I went out and bought the Soundtrack.<br /><br />The soundtrack is an amazing soundtrack.  When I listen to it I can clearly invision the scenes from the movie.  I have become a small fan of David Bowie and his singing voice (not to mention his many vocal talents).  I am in love with \\"As The World Falls Down\\" because it's one of those songs that can sing you to sleep, whisper in your ear.  It's a beautiful melody that is played throught the movie.<br /><br />But what I really think deserves a lot of credit is Trevor Jones hauntingly synthizied score.  It reminds me of the 80's! \\"Sarah\\" has to be my favorite track, because of its almost hypnotic fairy-like melody and the interweving of Jareth's theme.  And the last insturmental, \\"Home At Last\\", when Sarah sees her friends from the other world wish her a farewell.<br /><br />\\"...If you need us.\\"<br /><br />And then the reprise of Underground on a more happier theme!<br /><br />Clearly, if you are a fan of 80's music, David Bowie, Jim Henson, fantasy, Trevor Jones--in final words, GET THIS SOUNDTRACK!  Even if you are not that much of a Bowie fan, you will learn to at least appreciate him! :)
0790729350|5.0|EXCELLENT DELIVERY, RIGHT ON TIME AND IN PERFECT SHAPE!! IT IS NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES.  I GIVE A VERY ENTHUSIATIC TWO THUMBS UP!
076113719X|4.0|This is always first on my Christmas list! <br />It is a wonderful, clear way of organising all of our appointments, sports and other activities, with boxes that are actually big enough to write in! <br />I but them for all of my family!
0790729644|4.0|This is probably more of a \\"guys\\" film and one of my husband's all time favorites but I enjoyed its gritty portrayal of the <br />underbelly of the old west vs. the usual glamorous hollywoodized versions.  That time in US history was rough and dirty and only the strong did survive.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss Whedon is one of the best (and under appriciated) minds in Hollywood.  Not only is this movie intelligent, it will make you laugh and cry and think and it will blow your mind.  I would've never thought you can make an exellent film about space cowboys but here it is and it is wonderful.  Like a leaf in the wind...
B0000042MY|5.0|Perhaps my favorite musical score.  Preparing to be abandoned on a deserted island, this CD would definitely be included in my suitcase.
6304696566|4.0|This movie is one of my all-time favorite John Wayne films.  The combination of a great cast under the direction of the one and only, John Ford, make this one a true \\"Cowboy Classic\\" film.  John wayne should have won an Academy Award for this one.
0679731725|5.0|This book is truly profound.  The quiet narration of the text allows one to delve deep into the meaning and the character of each person involved in the novel.  The drama comes not from the actions of the characters, but from the motives and psychological flaws in them
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Wow... I didn't expect \\"Hostel\\" to be so vicious. I can't recall any American director making such violent and brutal movies as this one.<br /><br />Three friends who travel in Europe looking for some good time (sex, drugs & rock'n'roll), finally find themselves in a little Slovakian town, in a hostel where everything seems to fit their idea of heaven on Earth. And as it's easy to imagine, soon this heaven turns into hell or even worse.<br /><br />And so \\"Hostel\\" starting as an average teenage sex-comedy, closer to its second half turns into a bloody mess. But not that stupid teen slasher bloody mess - I mean real sick and horrid bloody mess.<br /><br />Directors used to fight for appropriate ratings for their films lately, hence we don't get to see pictures that are SO gory very often. Eli Roth obviously doesn't care about ratings, so \\"Hostel\\" turned out to be everything a true horror fan can only dream of. His film is full of gore, severed limbs, sweat and vomit. Believe me, for a long time we haven't seen such a brutal, twisted and in-your-face picture as Eli Roth's \\"Hostel\\". But it's far from being perfect though. It's extremely disturbing and nauseous, as a horror fan I liked it a lot, but there's still something missing. Some characters' development maybe, some sense... It seemed that trying to shock the audience, the makers of the film forgot why they'd decided to make it in the first place. But it's just the second big movie of Roth, he's young and very talented, I'm sure he'll give the fans hell in the nearest future.<br /><br />Interesting observation - I just watched \\"Hostel\\" in theater, and after the film people were lowering their eyes as if they were ashamed they were watching it. That's what I call a good horror movie!
B00005M989|5.0|I love this CD.  It has all of the great Prince songs you know and love.  Highly recommended.
B00005JOIF|4.0|I had read about the controversy surrounding this film and was really interested in seeing how this film would turn out. I had read that perhaps the story behind this film was made up despite protestations that they had accurate resources. Obviously other reviewers here have reviewed the movie in greater detail but I have to say I enjoyed it immensely. I was surprised by the audacity that Spielberg went to make this film. Yes I know he made Schindler's List but for me he's always been more interested in crowd-pleasers. This however seemed like a labour of love. The scenery is shot so beautifully, that it's quite breathtaking. You get into the minds of these people, their fear, their doubts, their paranoias. Most of all their beliefs too. And when they have to commit something their conscience would usually tell them not to do, that is what is interesting. It was interesting to see how people's beliefs drive them to do something they wouldn't normally do - how they feel for their families they have to leave behind and may never see again. How even sleeping on a bed is a killer. The fact that these memories remain in their minds is something they have to live with. The feeling that they could be constantly in jeopardy. How politics can sometimes can get in the way of religion or even play a part in politics. It's an endless game that no one wins and the only loss can be somebody's life. It's to Spielberg's credit that he made a film like this that questions people's beliefs and whether the interpretations people get out of them are really true. A masterpiece of film making. Well worth investigating even if you might not agree with what the film's message intends to be. However these are just my thoughts, yours can be totally different to what I have just put down. Savour this one.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I knew next to nothing about Veronica Mars when I finally chose to buy it.  I am a fan of the long cancelled Firefly and among the many topics of discussion were great shows that do not get enough attention or have been cancelled.  Wonderfalls is among those cancelled, but Veronica Mars goes on.  That said, I couldn't see a \\"teen\\" show being of interest to me until I read my hundredth or so promotion raving about the great writing and characters.<br /><br />I must say that the show surpassed my expectations in all ways.  I am an avid book reader and what I love about this series is how every episode brings about both answers and new questions, which, by the end, make the whole series that much better.<br /><br />I recommend this very highly and so long as they maintain the respect and faithfullness to the quality being displayed, I hope to see Veronica Mars for many years to come.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I vaguely remember seeing the ads for the show way back when it was on the air, but somehow missed out on seeing it. Then the move \\"Serenity\\" came out. I rented it and it quickly became one of my all-time favorite movies. I had no choice. I simply had to see the show. I was hooked. <br /> <br />The cast is amazing. The scripts are serious, witty, sad and humorous all at the same time. Truly an incredible show. One can always hope for a revival of the series. I am.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|When I found out that the TV show \\"Firefly\\" was cancelled I was very disappointed, so was my husband. We really liked the show. So we were VERY excited and happy to hear about the new movie (with the original cast from the TV show) \\"SERENITY\\". <br /> <br />I am not a huge science fiction fan, nor do Westerns in particular grab my attention (except a few great ones) - but you don't have to be a fan of either to enjoy this movie.  <br /> <br />It is a fun, witty, well-written and acted and fast-paced movie that I would rate as one of the top 5 movies of 2005 (for me, it was number 1). I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br />What I liked so much about \\"Serenity\\" is the blend of wild west atmosphere and space adventures- it's totally unexpected but actually works well; the blend of witty dialogue and action -packed scenes. This movie has a message, a good one at that, but it does not hit you over the head with - unlike so many other movies these days. <br /> <br />You do not have to see the TV series \\"Firefly\\" to like the movie- but I would recommend it, because it adds a lot of depth and understanding to this movie. <br /> <br />All in all, wonderful movie - give it a try!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I was not an original viewer but came to it through a friend.  I am so sorry I did not see the series when it was on TV.  I would have written a thousand letters not to take it off, as I did when they tried to take off \\"Star Trek\\" back in to '60s.  \\"Firefly\\" is everything you love about science fiction and westerns combined with memorable characters whose adventures stick to your ribs.  They care about each other so, you care about them.  I would still write letters to have them bring \\"Firefly\\" back to TV.  Until then, I will play and replay my DVDs.  Thanks Joss Whedon for a great series.
0553801503|5.0|Although I'm not an avid reader of the fantasy novels, I do rate this series as one of the best that I have read. The breadth of the characters, their families (they also have their dominant traits) and the complex interrelations make this book and the others in the series a fantastic read. I also love the fact that you know what each character is thinking (italics) even though what he says may be quite different in apperance. <br />Self interest, bravery, revenge, loyalty, ambition and chivalry are all part of the beauty of the game of throwns. A great read.
0440238609|5.0|No need to describe- simply fantastic. A little weird at first, but some of the best books I have ever read. Especially The Subtle Knife.
B0002OERI0|5.0|American Idiot is probably my favorite album of all time and I think it is a very good release for last. I have lots of great releases. Though this would be my most favorite. I don't think that U2 Latest CD is any good because I hear this annoying song Vertigo too much. It didn't win any god damn awards. It is just stupid. I mean why do people like that song so much? I never really liked U2. OK, Back to American Idiot I wanted to tell you that I'm ready to meet Green Day because they rocked so hard. They make you bang your head. Every song is excellent. My favorites are Jesus Of Suburbia, Holiday, & Whatsername. The track that really rocks hard is Homecoming. Other Green Day is good too, Warning. But the Green Day record I hate is Dookie, why do people like that record so much? I have listened to that record once and I hate the music. I think no good songs on it. <br />I may want Nimrod in my collection and I will check it out eventully to see if it is as good as either Warning, or American Idiot. American Idiot to me seems to rank the best out of Green Day albums. And remember, Green Day isn't a god damn punk band. They are hard rock. All these songs are rock and roll. I own this record on LP also and it is great. I have a few copies of it on CD too. This is an Excellent Record. Definately 5 STARS.
0812550706|5.0|I picked up this book a bit dubiously, after reading the first page quickly. The prose seemed minimalist, and not-too-inspired. But very rapidly, the plot picked up and I couldn't put it down until I finished it late into the night. When I read the end of it, it brought a tear to my eye - not because it was over, but because it was so poignant. It's the first book to bring a small year to my eye since the age of 8, and I am not easily moved only by writing alone.<br /><br />By the end of the book, you will feel and know Ender. It will hold you on, and not let go until the full scope of the story is finally revealed, and the book ends. I won't ruin it for you: you'll have to read it to find out. Suffice to say that it will leave you both satisfied and wanting more. The book can easily stand on its own, but I went ahead and picked up the second volume as well in the saga though I haven't completed it yet.<br /><br />The descriptions may be lacking at times, but I would easily nominate this book as having one of the best science-fiction stories I've read in a great while. Easily a classic.<br /><br />Buy this book, and you will not be disappointed.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|i saw brokeback mountain a month ago and just hearing the music from the soundtrack flashes everything before my eyes again. i was impressed to see a movie in which the music was so perfectly set. After seeing the movie the first time, i immediately came home and ordered the soundtrack. you know you've found something special when just listening to the score can bring tears to your eyes. i highly recommend this product.
B0009S4IHY|1.0|This movie is enough to make me quit watching Stephen Chow's movies.  I had expected more of him.  There were some very good special effects, and some reasonably good fight scenes, but over all my impression was \\"why did I waste my money?\\".  In a lot of this type of movies I can set the language to Mandarin and practice my Chinese, this didn't even have that choice.  Overall my recommendation is don't even waste your time renting this one.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great movie - great tv series! One of the few movies that I've enjoyed watching more that once. It's a shame that Firefly didn't get the popularity that it deserves. Joss Whedon put together an excellent series. I hope there is more to come!
B0007XT87G|5.0|While it's not quite as innovative or wide-ranging as its predecessor In Absentia, Porcupine Tree's latest is yet another tasty Pink-Floyd-meets-Opeth-by-way-of-Radiohead offering from one of the only bands to ever come close to making progressive rock sound cool.  If you liked the genre-bending sounds and oddly layered arrangements of In Absentia, then this album should leave you grinning like, erm, a young person in a store that sells sweets, as it's chock full of all the elements that make PT such a brilliant and distinctive band.  Once again, they combine crazy instrumental skills with intricate, unpredictable songwriting and the haunting, emotional vocals of Steven Wilson, who makes up in power for anything he might lack in polish.  Though it contains only nine tracks, Deadwing has plenty of goodies to offer the discerning listener, as it cycles through a vast mix of sounds-ranging from the dark, dense, and metallic to the spacey and Floydian to the melodic and folky-often within the space of a single song.  For the most part, this album is divdided between lengthy, multifaceted epics (Arriving Somewhere But Not Here, Deadwing), and shorter, sharper rockers marked by striking riffs and surprisingly infectious choruses (Halo, Start of Something Beautiful).  Naturally, this being PT, things aren't that simple, as there are plenty of variations on the theme to be found as well: hypnotic keyboard textures drift in and out of the midtempo, riff-driven gallop of the title track; the angry, assaultive guitar crunch of Shallow segues without warning into a disarmingly pretty piano-backed vocal melody before lurching back to metal with a vicious chorus; and Glass Arm Shattering ends everything on a languid, mellow note.  As on their previous album, perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of PT's approach is their restraint: unlike certain other bands in the oft-derided prog metal genre (Dream Theater come up often, although there are many far worse offenders), nothing about PT's songs ever sounds forced or pretentious, even when they flirt with (or go past) the ten-minute mark, I've yet to hear a PT song overstay its welcome.  And, fortunately, there are still no keyboard solos.PT's songs ever sounds forced or pretentious, even when they flirt with (or go past) the ten-minute mark, I've yet to hear a PT song overstay its welcome.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never heard of the Firefly series until a friend talked me into borrowing his DVDs of it. He was convinced that I'd like it, but he was wrong. I loved it! <br /> <br />Although I addictively watched the show in every spare moment and 'devoured' the series in a week, I hated to return the DVDs to my friend and dragged my heels, finally returning them after having them for a month. I borrowed them again a mere month later, then gave up and purchased my own when I realized I couldn't stand the thought of not possessing them. <br /> <br />Firefly represents the best in TV programming and the best of creator Joss Whedon. The characters are so well-thought-out and varied that it's hard to conceive of what the show would be like without each of them.  <br /> <br />The dialogue is witty, clean, and Robert Heinlein-esque in its use of various Chinese phrases (mostly as easy-to-understand expletives). My daughters and I 'talk Firefly' on an almost-daily basis, using words such as \\"dong-ma\\" and \\"gorram.\\" <br /> <br />Firefly incorporates the themes of space, westerns, action and comedy into a smartly woven masterpiece. <br /> <br />It's no Space Trek or Star Wars; there are no alien-monster beings. This show represents Joss Whedon's perspective on what space travel and government control may actually be like in the future. I bought the concept. I think most other people will, too.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I thought it had a great mix of contemporary sounds and spanish love songs.Am still enjoying the tunes.
B000AGTPUA|1.0|This movie does not even compare to the movies Tom has done. The animation is horrible. The blending is no where near even good, the voice to character movement was totaly(no offense and I am not racist) like something out of a English speaking movie with the Chineese actors where they look like they are just moving their lips and a voice over is being done, and this is a annimation that you do with computers. All of the characters look like they are devilish little creatures instead of little kids. I watch about 45 minutes of the movie and I had to turn it off, there was no other option. The point behind the story is good, getting the new generations to still believe in old Saint Nick, but they went about it the total wrong way.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I had to see for myself what all the hoopla was about, when I viewed Brokeback Mountain, as it had been used as a topic of discussion and the brunt of many homophobic jokes on the \\"Jay Leno Show\\" as well as other daytime and late night talk shows when it was in the theatres. It was touted as a great \\"chick flick,\\" where guys can show their sensitive side afterwards and win points with their dates. It has been called a \\"gay cowboy movie,\\" which it isn't, because the two main characters are not cowboys, but are shepherds. [The western attire somehow translated into cowboy with many viewers, but it takes place in the years after 1963, not in the old West.] <br /> <br />It's a heart-wrenching story about two young men who are forced into a situation of isolation as they shepherd a huge flock of sheep on Brokeback Mountain. Loneliness leads to playful interaction, which leads to sharing a tent, then to sharing body heat, and finally to sharing emotional and then sexual intimacy. At the end of the short-termed shepherding contract, the two men depart, both torn asunder by the loss they feel for each other. Years pass, marriages and babies become part of each man's life. Then they are reunited, and all the past intimacy returns to haunt them. \\"I wish I knew how to quit you,\\" is the cry of the one man as he recognizes and struggles with the depth of ongoing feelings he has for his now older lover.  His lover responds stoicly, \\"Then why don't you?\\" <br /> <br />In an era where a child is told about a homosexual couple being discovered and a homosexual man is dragged to his death by his genitals until they detach from his body, neither of the story's protagonists are able to deal with the social consequences of loving another man. Neither is able to tell anyone, including his wife. Both turn to alcohol. One turns to secretly meeting other men. Every emotion is strained as one watches the torment of both of these men, their wives, and even their children. Divorce partially delivers one, because \\"you weren't fishing,\\" when he met his lover, but he remains focussed on raising his two children, still being unable to develop his relationship with his lover. How the story ends left many a tearful eye by the time the credits rolled in the theatres. And many a married man will be secretly watching this movie on DVD to find out how NOT alone he is in the world of men secretly loving men.  <br />
B000002OTL|5.0|I still enjoy this collection as much as when I first heard them 12 years ago. An incredable  balance of many types of music.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Hey! I really, really like P!nk's music and lyrics. She is awesome! She is everything I wanted to be growing up and now that I'm in my 50's, well, um, unfortunately I can't imitate her except in the privacy of my car or home! LOL!!! <br />You have to really listen to the words and \\"feel\\" her. Especially Family Portrait. She has a wonderful soulful voice. I think she is very, very talented and I will buy all her music she has out. As far as the Mom wanting to buy Missundaztood for her 9 year old because the 9 year old liked the Get This Party Started cut? Well, hello? Mom! What's your 9 year old wanting to Get This Party Started for anyway? Sheesh!  <br />P!nk rules! I think she is extremely talented. <br />Keep on singing girlfriend!!! <br />:O)
B000AY74OG|5.0|My entire family enjoyed this movie!!  I highly recommend for adults as well as children.  It's the perfect match for both young and old.
B000BP86OG|5.0|At first it took me  a while to take this band serious. once I got through Justin Hawkins Freddy Mercurylike falsetto.  I realized how good this band really was.  With their follow up to their surprisingly good Permission to Land cd, One Way ticket does not dissapoint.  They kept their AC DC influence, but also threw in some Queen like harmony and in certain places I noticed some old Def Leppard licks.  Maybe a band like this could remind Leppard how an old school British band is supposed to rock out!  I feel this cd is a must for old school rockers who want the fun back in their music.
1402545355|5.0|Every time I listen to this audio book, Alexander McCall Smith takes me directly to Africa.  The scene is vivid in my mind and the characters are both exotic and intimate.  I feel as though I am there.  The narrator, Lisette Lecat, has a pleasant accent and is easy to understand.  Her voice is like music.  I love all the audio books in this series.
B00005JSGK|5.0|One of the best movies John Wayne ever did, plus the rhino injury is real.  I love this movie cuz it makes you laugh, it has good action scenes, and the love story ain't have bad either. Overall I would definately reccommend this DVD.
B00005JJX8|5.0|generally implausible, but such a wonderful ride to the happy ending with Hitchcock at his best in steering the superb cast around the obstacles. Lovely scenery and a foretaste of Grace Kelly's driving.
B00005K3NR|5.0|2 years ago I was afraid to watvh this movie.The first time I saw this movie was on superstation and I love this movie alot.I  am going through the same things Carrie is going through(no I do not have phycic powers)but people make fun of me with no remorse.I barely have any friends and the boy I like is such a bigot towards me.The end may cry alot.It's not scary it's more suspenceful.12 year olds would like this movie.
B00009V7P8|4.0|Damien has a really cool voice that conveys a lot of emotion... some of the songs are kind of haunting in a good way. Some of it is a bit \\"folk-y\\" for me, but otherwise very much enjoy the album. Love the song from \\"Closer\\" which is why I purchased the album.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I was really pleased with it. i purchased it as a gift and the person was so happy to receive it. Really a great product.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|While I understand that people love Madonna (I am fond of her) this album is pointless. Tracks 1 - 10 sound like one non-stop song............the same song. Nice stuff - but sounds like it was put together in one night. I'm not saying it was....but it just sounds like it. Someone here posted that 'Disco gets a new lease on life'. I can agree with this statement in that it has a monotonous feel throughout the whole album. Oh well. It definitely is upbeat and 'club-friendly'. Once again the public doesn't need much to impress them.......I give you Madonna's version of 'American Idol'. Nothing more - nothing less - nothing new. Oh - and the one star is because it's Madonna.
0553801503|2.0|I hate to say it - since I loved the first three books - but it really isn't worth the trouble...  To me, it read like a history textbook.  There were more pages dedicated to the names, lineages, and the shield crests of characters that are ancillary to the tale than actual \\"goings on\\" or action in the story.  Quite a disappointment, especially after a delay of well over a year in the publishing of the book. <br /> <br />Frankly, I was waiting for Nynaeve to start the braid pulling... <br />
068485743X|4.0|I laughed from page one as I imagined editors gnashing their teeth, twisting their hair, and chewing their pens until red ink dripped from their chins.  If I were an editor by profession, I would be thanking Noah Lukeman for this book.<br /><br />With humor and humility, Mr. Lukeman gently leads the reader toward better writing style.  He is acutely aware of the tender sensibilities that we writers share, and he is careful not to tread upon them too roughly.  When I look back at some of my earlier work and recall some of my responses to well-deserved criticism, I can't help feeling a bit sheepish.  All aspiring writers ought to be required to read a book like this before they are allowed to submit even one crystal of slush to the slushpile.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that the book does not delve too deeply into the subject, so it certainly isn't a cure-all or a reference.  I think it does introduce the topic quite nicely, though.  Bottom line: It's cheap, it's a quick read, and it just might help.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Phantom quite frankly shocked me as to how good it is.  I had planned to see it in its theatrical run but my timing would not allow. So, I saw it the first time on HBO.  The next day I ordered it from amazon and in 5.1 widescreen plasma was in a word; AWESOME.<br /><br />The performance by Emmy Rossum left me in a daze for days. Why? She's brilliant! Additionally her subtle beauty and magical voice lent credibility to the story and the torment of the love triangle between Chistine(Rossum), The Phantom and Raoul.  The story is extremely plausible and the performances have the ability to actually make one empathetically feel the emotion as the characters emote. Gerard Butler as The Phantom was wonderful.  His voice is not in the same class as Rossum's but his performance and acting make up in spades.<br /><br />Way high kudos to the roles of Firmin and Andre played respectively by Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Simon Callow.  It's hard to believe but these guys can actually sing. They were great, funny, witty and thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br /> Then there's the music.  It's amazing that the same basic tune and melody can convey so much meaning in so many different scenarios.  The original cast production is better simply because there is no match for Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford.<br /><br />One caution however; pay attention and don't view this movie when you're tired.  Every little scene adds to the fantastic layering of the story.  If you miss this or miss that, you won't understand the delayed impact points.  For example, the story opens with an auction for a monkey-playing-cymbals music box.  It doesn't make much sense until mid movie and one really needs to understand what it represents to fully understand the power of the ending of the movie.<br /><br />Then there are the costumes; they're wonderful.  If you liked Baz Lurman's Moulin Rouge, then you will absolutely love this film.  Any regrets??? Yes, one. Like Casablanca, and Citizen Kane, they were made before I was born so I never saw them on the big screen.  I wished I had seen this lush film, Phantom, in a megaplex.  The small screen is great but seeing this on DVD is like seeing Titanic or Star Wars for the first time on DVD; what I'm saying is that nothing compares for certain films like a theater viewing.<br /><br />Last thing is the 2nd DVD. It contains wonderful scenes on the history of the film, the project and Weber's long-time collaboration with Joel Schumacher.  It is an enchanting view inside what it took to make an instant film classic.<br /><br />Mike Way
0307276902|4.0|Good book.  Could help some people open their eyes to their similar situations and/or life styles, but, will be hard for people to trust his efforts due to his dishonesty about his life.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie continues to increasingly strike home for me each time I watch it as I've gotten older and closer to the age of the main characters.  As I've depressingly realized in my own lifestyle, material possesions tend to define my entire self image at times.  And as this film tells us, we have to fight against that urge to conform to what our society would otherwise tell us to embody: a productive worker-bee drone that spends and consumes as much as possible while at the same time thinking as little as possible to accept the status quo.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|Bear McCreary is an unsung genius. His use of percussion as a melodic instrument is rarely seen, especially in the mainstream. In ten years he'll be considered one of the greats alongside Danny Elfman and Phillip Glass. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, the CD rocks too. So does the show. Yeah...
0684135051|5.0|Despite her vast experience as a knitter, Elizabeth Zimmerman always seemed to recall what it was like to do something new with needles and yarn for the first time.  Reading this book is like reading a letter from a friend, who is a fantastically good knitter and has a lot of good advice in plain English that she shares with you.  You won't find row-by-row instructions, but she provides overviews of the knitting experience and lots of helpful hints.
0440133688|5.0|My mother was an RN in a Jewish teaching hospital, so I grew up familiar with 'Buff 'n Turf', Gomers, etc. I also frequently ran into naked interns in our bathroom at 6 am; my mother was a firm believer in RN's providing 'terns with a well-rounded education.  From that angle alone I can attest to the truthfulness of this book. <br /> <br />I am also a health care provider (EMS), and this book used to be required reading for our Paramedic students before they started their hell year (until the college discovered the contents of the book and yanked it from the curriculum). <br /> <br />Based on my experiences, I think anyone involved with any aspect of health care, or anyone interested in entering the field, should read this book.  Yeah, a lot of stuff may not apply anymore, especially in the current sexual-harrassment era, but there's still a lot of insight to be gained from the book.  I think it's a pretty accurate reflection of the culture of medicine, from the raw, dark, and frankly sexual humor, to the foxhole-camaraderie, to the unavoidibly depressing aspects. And there are a few clinical nuggets to be learned from the Fat Man (\\"In an emergency...\\"). <br /> <br />Perhaps most importantly, I think it's a finely written book and a good read. I read it for the first time when I was 12, and I've read it many times since.  It's been a pleasure every time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What would have happened to Han Solo and the rest of Star Wars' Rebel Alliance, if the reality of the Empire's superior numbers and firepower had led to the inevitable conclusion?  Six or seven years later, would they have assimilated back into Imperial subjects?  Or would they, heartbroken, have fled to the outskirts of the Empire, to try to carve out some kind of life--always in the shadow of the defeat of their fondest hopes and dreams?    By the 26th century, society has progressed, but neither to the bland utopia of Star Trek's Federation nor to the totalitarian dystopia of Star Wars' Empire.  The Alliance is a prosperous, advanced, democratic society that has brought stability and civilization to some forty worlds.  The worst one can say about it is that a certain type of personality finds it a bit... stifling.    Firefly is the story of a spaceship that the U.S.S. Enterprise wouldn't even deign to hail.  \\"Serenity\\" is a cargo ship, which no more has guns than do today's semis.  She is crewed by a motley collection of people who, for a variety of reasons, fit at best uneasily into larger society.      What sets Firefly apart is the complexity of its nuanced characters.  Ship's pilot Wash is innocent, witty, open-hearted--and is almost always the voice of skepticism.  Shepherd (\\"Reverend\\") Book is a gentle holy man whose closest friendship is arguably with the uncouth mercenary Jayne.  The stories--the series' tragically shortened arc--deal with love and loss, morality and honor, peace versus violence and action versus inaction, and, mostly, about every person's struggle to make peace with their demons and fumble on, uncertainly, towards rebirth.  If \\"Buffy\\" is a show about adolescence, \\"Firefly\\" is about adulthood.
0812550706|4.0|One of my few trips into the science fiction section at the library.... <br />My hubby had been suggesting that I read this book for some time so I decided to take a shot at it and was impressed.  The story of Ender starts from the humble beginnings of being a \\"third\\" to the military leader that \\"saved the earth\\".  It is a heart wrenching of an intelligent boy that grew up too fast and quickly lost his innocence.  Ender is young and knows he is intelligent, as are his older brother Peter and sister Valentine.  The government is on a quest to find a commander who will fight and rescue the earth from the next bugger invasion.  After Peter fails the test to become \\"the one\\" Ender is put into military training at a young age.  Ender exceeds the expectation of all the military personnel as he conquers games that have never been won before.  As Ender becomes more successful as a military leader he is more lonesome than ever.  One last game, one last test was more that Ender could have perceived.  It drained his remaining energy and changed the world.       <br />  <br /> It was an interesting look at culture, the extremes of human genetic profiling, and the definition of childhood.  Although I am not typically a big fan of \\"war games\\", the vivid description of these zero gravity games was an interesting concept.  I also found Card's description of the computer systems and technology fairly accurate; consider the book was written during the 1970's. <br />
B00004Y6NP|5.0|What more praise can be lavished on this album - wow! Brothers in Arms was Mark Knopfler's tour de force. It made 1985 that much more enjoyable as a high school sophomore. I knew of Dire Straits before this thanks to my sister, but this album blew me away. Massive guitar riffs, crashing drums and humorous as well as poetic lyrics. There were strains of Dylan (\\"So Far Away\\"), Springsteen (\\"Walk of Life\\") and pure Dire Straits (\\"Money for Nothing\\"). The title track is beautiful. A masterpiece you have to own.
0066620996|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  As a veteran of the corporate world who recently transitioned into contract work, many of the concepts in this book were very insightful and interesting.  It is very fun to read and Jim Collins' enthusiasm about the topic shines through and is very contagious.  I shared this book with my father who was able to apply the concepts with a long-term vision planning group with his church.  If there's one non-fiction book you read this year, make it this one.  You are sure to get something out of it.
B000002GH1|4.0|I bought this on tape back in '85 based on the appeal of \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\" and thought that song would be on this album. I was disappointed to learn the band had deliberately left out that song because it wasn't the sound they were going for, but I was pleased this album was still very listenable. \\"Alive and Kicking\\" is my favorite track as well as being a smash hit. The piano interlude on that song is genius. I also like \\"Sanctify Yourself,\\" \\"Ghostdancing\\" and \\"All the Things She Said.\\" Charlie Burchill's guitar work is stellar and Jim Kerr has a great pop voice backed by excellent harmonies. I can understand why this was Simple Minds' international breakthrough.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|The mere premise of a Confederate ironclad ship somehow winding up buried underneath the desert of Africa was enough to make me want to see this film.  How the heck are they going to explain that one?  Sahara was a different film than I expected, however; I pictured these guys out there digging up this historical relic, but there's very little of an archaeological nature to what turned out to be a fast-paced, quick-witted thrill ride of an adventure.  The discovery of the ironclad ship sort of falls into the background as the story mixes in a deadly plague, a brutal African dictator, and a potential threat to life as we know it.  Don't expect things to get too serious, though, as \\"treasure hunters\\" Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and his hilarious sidekick Al (Steve Zahn) basically laugh their way through an incredible series of dangerous escapes and reckless acts of heroism.  These guys could show MacGyver a trick or two.<br /><br />Dirk works for NUMA (National Underwater and Marine Agency), and he manages to talk his boss into giving him a couple of days to follow up on an important clue to his pet obsession; not surprisingly, most folks think he's crazy to argue that the lost Confederate ironclad The Texas somehow crossed the Atlantic and now rests beneath the sands of Africa.  Along the way, though, Dirk and Al get a little sidetracked by Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) and her cohort Dr. Hopper (Glynn Turman), doctors with the World Health Organization trying to find the source of a deadly, spreading infection.  That source lies in Mali, a country ravaged by fighting between the forces of General Kazim (Lennie James) and rebels opposing his dictatorial ways.  Dr. Rojas does indeed run into trouble, but the personal danger she faces is nothing compared to the dangers she and Dirk eventually discover out in the wastelands of the desert.  Dirk and Al are a two-man wrecking crew, single-handedly taking out whatever comes their way - armed soldiers, tanks, helicopters, you name it.  A lot of it is ridiculously over the top - yet all the more entertaining for that very reason - you'll be rolling your eyes, but you'll be laughing as you do so.<br /><br />Sahara is really an action comedy.  A Confederate ironclad ship buried beneath the Sahara (carrying oodles of gold coins, to boot) is far from the most improbable plot element on display here.  McConaughey and Zahn are great in their roles, though, and that is the real secret to this movie's success.  The wrong actor in the role of either Dirk or Al would have been disaster, as the fanciful story could never have stood on its own two legs without the support of the right actors.  I can't say I truly bought Penelope Cruz as a doctor, but she more than held her own when it came to playing hardball with the big boys.  Of course, it helps when the bad guys are the worst shots in the world; it's actually rather ridiculous, as these guys almost surely broke the world's record for most missed shots in one movie.<br /><br />It's pretty simple, really - if you like action comedies, you should enjoy Sahara.  The comedic banter between the actors is consistently funny, there are plenty of action scenes chock full of gunfights, explosions, and fisticuffs, and you won't find any dull moments once things really get going.ame it.

B000001FS3|5.0|After their much-ballyhooed reinvention on Achtung Baby and subsequent excesses, I still think this is U2's finest hour. They may have diversified their style and gotten even bigger (and more pretentious) after this, but you can't fault this music. It's excellent guitar-driven rock and Bono's voice soars. The lyrics are thoughtful and poetic, some songs containing Bono's Christian imagery (\\"see the thorn twist in your side\\") and spiritual yearning (\\"Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\"), others with political musings or just songs about love and loss. The Edge's guitar work is phenomenal and Adam Clayton's bass and Larry Mullen's drums meld with it to create a tight, full sound. This album remains as beautiful and essential as it was in 1987.
B00008PX8P|5.0|As a fan of Led Zeppelin, I found this two-DVD set fabulous, and I've watched it several times already. I'm a musician, and I often use the footage to study drum, bass, guitar and vocal riffs and techniques. And of course, it's great entertainment. I highly recommend this DVD to fans and anyone who is ready to open their mind to phenomenal levels of musicianship, band cohesiveness, and musical creativity.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows of all time. If you like westerns or sci-fi, this is a must see.
B000063UR2|5.0|I \\"grew up\\" loving the Tangerine Dream version of Legend.  The soundtrack is so haunting, and listening to it always reminds me of that surrealistic forest Jack and Lilly inhabit.  However, the Director's Cut has its own magic.  I like the extended sequence when Jack meets Gump and his friends, and has to be tested.  The menace of Darkness is enhanced as well. I love both versions of the movie.
0783240287|5.0|Great story, delightfully written lyrics, creative music, wonderfully done. Costuming a bit risque at points.
B00005AAFS|4.0|I'm a casual Rammstein fan; I only have Sehnsucht and Mutter.  Of the two I prefer Sehnsucht because it had a wide variety and flowed together rather well.  Mutter is definitely the heavier of the two albums; however it doesn't keep my interest for as long as Sehnsucht does.  Both have their highlights and flaws.  Both are 4 star albums.  With Mutter the first five songs are awesome.  After that it becomes a hit or miss situation.  This is a solid album, but definitely not perfect (neither was Sehnsucht).  I'm not quite sure what to say.  A lot of Rammstein songs center around one dimensional topics, sex, bizarre things, etc.  For example the song Zwitter is about hermaphrodites.  I've heard much stranger so this doesn't faze or shock me.  Their music seems to be more centered around their music and the delivery of the voice.  The vocalist Till has an amazing voice.  Like I said, I'm a casual fan so I find this album to be good but definitely not one of my favorites.  If you are a big Rammstein fan now, and do not have this album then definitely pick this up.  Several of my friends are in love with this album, I can see why but it doesn't necessarily click 100% with me.  Hoped this helped.   <br /> <br />
B000AU9UYM|5.0|When I first heard of this movie I thought, \\"Not another one!\\", and I couldn't see what they could add to the story. Well, I was wrong -- they could and did add a lot to the back story of Batman.  And, not only that, they made the best of all the Batman movies yet!<br /><br />The always great Morgan Freedman plays a (James Bond's) \\"Q\\" type character, and helps Batman come up with all his familiar devices we so love from the stories.  It is interesting to see them in development -- as it is to see Bruce Wayne develop into the formidable Batman.<br /><br />Christian Bale plays the part of Batman beautifully, and very believably, and of course having Liam Neelson in your movie is always a big plus.  Despite what you may have heard re Liam's part, it is NOT the same as his part in Star Wars, tho it seems so at first as you watch.<br /><br />If you like Batman, or even if you don't, this is a \\"must see\\" movie!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Disregard what you may have heard about this series.  It is packed with action, humor and wit, and bears watching over and over.  The characters are engaging, the dialog crisp, and you'll see something different each time you watch.  Fox killed this series by showing episodes out of order, making it confusing to follow, changing day and time, skipping episodes, and then killing it.  Rent the series, or borrow it from a friend, then BUY the movie Serenity.  Many questions brought about by this series are answered, and the resolutions are satisfying.  Don't reward Fox for its' stupidity, but help make the DVD sales enough that we get a sequel.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I love the Celtic Woman Show.  The performers, the music, the lighting, the video editing, the entire performance is mesmerizing and uplifting. I watch and enjoy it frequently. <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is so enticing, as Emmy Rossum is fabulous in it with Gerard Butler, as the phantom, who is riveting in his part.  The music keeps you on your seat as it goes from one absoutely moving piece to another.  Minnie Driver as Carlotta, besides being beautiful, is hilarious.  Patrick Wilson, as Emmy's childhood sweetheart, is great.  You will cry, laugh and be moved deeply I believe with this movie.  The critics should have given it 3 stars instead of the 2 it got. <br />Connie T.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I was a little wary because of the understandable hype surrounding the first truly mainstream film focusing on passionate love between two male protagonists. The camerawork not only invited us into their fiery intimacy (featuring, but not limited to, the kind of close-ups normally reserved for 'women's films') but also offered jaw-dropping panoramas of a beautiful landscape. It was without doubt the most powerful film I have ever seen, reaching deep into my own experiences and leaving me unable to control my tears. My only regret is that ultimately it offered us such a bleak picture of star-crossed lovers, but at least that reminded me of the greatest love story of them all.
0393327655|2.0|Perhaps it's \\"only in America\\" that a book which purports to attack superstition can end up reaffirming it. <br /> <br />The early chapters are pretty good.  But it's rapidly downhill from there. <br /> <br />For example, after explaining the drawbacks of torture in the \\"war on witchcraft\\" (EVERYBODY ALWAYS CONFESSES!), the author turns right around and ENDORSES TORTURE in the \\"war on terrorism\\". <br /> <br />In fact, he's a \\"war on terrorism\\" kind of guy -- going so far as to favor a U.S. pre-emptive nuclear attack on any Muslim nation with nuclear arms. (!) <br /> <br />Then the book dribbles away with Buddhist babble and mindless yap about \\"spirituality\\". <br /> <br />If you're an atheist -- that is, rational on this subject -- you will be very disappointed in this book.

B00000E2VC|5.0|I have been a serious music fan for many years.  I have listened and relistened to a great many recordings.  This is my favorite.  I have rarely gone more than a week without listening to it.  The muzurkas give me the chills.  I have long made it a point to listen to any recording of the first Ballade I can find.  This one remains my absolute favorite.  If, as a culture, we were forced to choose one recording of piano music to last for all time and above all others, I would certianly vote early and vote often for this magnificent recording.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|This is an outstanding documentary of America's pre-eminent artist, poet and social commentator of the last half century. Scorsese does a fabulous job of stitching together old film and recordings to tell this tell.  The contrast in between the young Dylan responding to the press and Dylan today reflecting on his early days provides great insight into the Dylan's thinking and motivation. <br /> <br />This is a powerful piece and should viewed by all, whether a Dylan fan or not.

Nobody believes but in the confusion seven people get off the plane. 10 minutes later the plane blows up just like Alex says, the seven survives are in shock but its not over yet, its seems that death has a path set for everyone and when its messed with. Theirs no option but to finish what has to be done, to come back around to take care of loose ends.    <br /> <br />Teen horror with a good storyline and a well put together cast of young fresh faces,if your in for a fun ride with scares and chills this is all for you.  <br />
B000050FEN|5.0|This is a unique film, it's dark even by director-writer Fincher's standards.  It's a great movie, but you feel like you need to shower after seeing it.  The ending is of course infamous, but the film is so much more than the ending, and Freeman as always is great, as for Pitt, well I'm not a fan, but he works in this film.  Fincher has a thing for deep noir and this is dark, if you like suspenseful thrillers then you will really like this film, but not for the squeamish I assure you.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is more of a commentary than actual review, and encompasses both the Firefly TV show and Serenity, since they both involve the same characters and subject material: <br /> <br />If you didn't have the privilege or pleasure of seeing this amazing series (Firefly) in its short-lived run on FOX, rejoice in the fact that you can now possess it yourself and watch it for all time whenever you wish. On the surface, it seems like its all about cowboys in space, but there's much more. One of my favorite things about any of Joss Whedon's projects, from Buffy, to Angel, and finally Firefly, is that a great deal of time and care is lavished upon fleshing out and exploring the characters that fill the worlds he creates. In the final season of Angel, we were shown facets of Angel's personality, past and character we hadn't seen before, and that made him all the more real, likeable and interesting. The same is true for Firefly. Despite its short lifespan, great effort was made to explore each character so that in each episode, you were treated to maybe another glimpse into how Capt. Mal met his crew, what was done to River's mind, why Jayne is such an ass (a likeable one, though), and why Inara left the Core Worlds to continue her Companionship. Obviously, there were secrets and details we never learned, such as how a Shepherd would know so much about guns and combat as he does, and where the Reavers came from, but through the magic of the silver screen, Whedon's vision can once again come to life and reveal the rest of the secrets. <br /> <br />With the movie SERENITY, Whedon was able to bring his characters out of deep freeze and revive their world once again. The movie takes place maybe a year after the last episode of the TV series, and we know finally learn more about the characters, River most importantly, and the Reavers. The original Star Wars trilogy's (Ep. 4, 5, 6) greatest strength was its focus on the characters and their interactions, especially Empire Strikes Back. Back then, it wasn't only about the technology used to make huge armies and space battles, but about the characters; we cared that Vader was Luke's father, we cared that Han and Leia fell in love and then were separated by a bounty hunter/slab of carbonite. Just so, we care about Whedon's characters: that Buffy died, that Angel became the head of the company that tried to kill him, that Wash died bringing the Serenity's crew safe from the Reavers. That's why Firefly and Serenity are amazing, and that is why you should watch them.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This film is just plain cool, I really am not a fan of Norton or Pitt, but I thought they were just perfect for this film, Pitt has never been better, he steals every scene he is in, you can't take you eyes off of him, and Norton is just as good as the white collar loser..Pitt is ab fab and Norton's character is a total zero.  Helena Bonham Carter is an odd pick here, she is known for her Merchant Ivory aristocrates, but she knows this character and she owns it.  The twist at the end is of course famous, it will make you want to watch it again..and again.  Fincher is the perfect director for this, just as he was for Seven, and he really knows how to get the most out of his actors.  Great film.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I'm not even really a country music fan.  Or at least I wasn't before I listened to this disc.  I find myself listening to it over and over now.  It's an excellent companion to the movie, and stands strong on its own.
B00080ZG10|4.0|Honestly when I first heard they were making this film and casting Di Caprio I was perplexed, I mean I have seen pictures of Howard Hughes and he looks nothing like Leonardo, but amazingly as I watched this film I thought he embodied Hughes and even sort of resembled him.  Scorsese is of course a great director and he gets the most out of Leonardo, this is a demanding character and Di Caprio nails it.  The period clothes are great, this was a great time for fashion.  I don't know who the cinemaphotographer was, but he does a great job, the images are so crisp and well filmed.  Hughes was a fascinating subject and being from Houston, I was familiar with his story, but this indepth take is so interesting, whether you are interested in Hughes or not.  To this day his grave in Glenwood Cemetery, in the shadow of Houston's skyline, is the most visited burial place in the city.   Ah, the enigma that is Howard Hughes; weird dude.
0515125024|1.0|This is the third Child book that I have read. The first one, 'Killing Floor,' struck me as a very decently written mystery thriller. The writing is tense and Reacher is an interesting protagonist til you get to know him better. That story had some obvious flaws in its conception, but Child's writing was new enough for me to over look it. Secondly, I read 'Trip Wire' and was amazed that the plot was even more ludicrous than 'Killing Floor.' Lee Child has an obvious gift when it comes to pushing a story along, but it was wasted on the book. Lastly, I picked up 'Die Trying.' I should have known better than to expect a decent story and engaging mystery. Instead, from the very first page, Child treats the reader like an idoit and sets up the most mind boggling stupid plot ever to grace the pages of any book.<br /><br />If you don't heed this review and pick up 'Die Trying' anyways, watch how crazy it is that of all the people in the world, Reacher gets thrown into a situation that would statistically be trillions to one. Not only that, but Child starts up on the romance angle one more time exactly the way he did in the other two books that I mentioned. Where it was ok the first time, and stale the second, it was creepy in the third. I think that Lee Child might have more psychological sociopath issues than any mind I have ever encountered. His love scenes are built up as if they were out of some XXX movie, though in a corn ball fashion. If you want that stuff, read Henry Miller. His bad guys are for the most part as original as one of those extras you see James Bond shoot when he is blowing away all of the extras. And to top it all off, this whole series reads like it were not only written for the IQ reading level of a maximum security prison rat, but in the mental state of said rat as well. Power, manliness, and machismo are all that matter in Childs world. It's an ugly place and one that I won't visit again.<br /><br />What I would suggest, if you think that a book written in towards a prison yard population audience might be interesting, is that you try 'Dog Eat Dog' by Edward Bunker. That is a very well concieved and originaly executed novel. Everything that Child's books are not.ds a prison yard population audience might be interesting, is that you try 'Dog Eat Dog' by Edward Bunker.

If I had to summarize this concert in one word, that word would be \\"EXCELLENT\\"
B000E1155E|5.0|These newcomers in the \\"Next Franz Ferdinand\\" sweepstakes come barreling out of the gates like a turbo-charged street racer fueled by caffeine, cigarettes, and testosterone. But unlike their Scottish labelmates, Arctic Monkeys boast a snotty, snarling, distinctively British DIY aesthetic that at times recalls everyone from The Streets to Oasis, from The Clash to The Jam. <br />  <br />\\"The View From the Afternoon\\" opens the album with a jittery bang, offering up a punkish guitar groove driven by drummer Matt Helders' light-speed hi-hat work before breaking into a ska-influenced bridge that could convert fans of The Specials. The debut single, \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor,\\" is an equally hyperactive explosion of energy in which frontman Alex Hunter tosses off tasty tidbits of poetic brilliance such as, \\"There ain't no love, no Montagues or Capulets/Just banging tunes and DJ sets... and dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness.\\" But these laddish hooligans are no one-trick ponies: \\"Fake Tales of San Francisco\\" offers up a catchy dance beat that recalls the Happy Mondays, \\"Riot Van\\" is a lounge-friendly crooner about youthful brushes with the law, while \\"Red Light Indicates the Doors Are Secure\\" is just downright funky.  <br />  <br />But \\"Mardy Bum\\" is arguably the standout track-- a bittersweet tribute to a moody girlfriend that, with witty lines like \\"I've seen your frown and it's like looking down the barrel of a gun,\\" comes off as the best song The Smiths never wrote. It's hard to believe in anything propped up by the here-today-gone-tomorrow N.M.E. hype machine these days, but these raucous Sheffield boys have crafted a rambunctious debut album that makes you wanna drive down the highway at 90mph, drink to excess, get into a drunken bar fight, kiss someone you barely know, take them for an all-night shag, and wake up the next morning, hungover, wondering if it was all a dream. Not that you'd do any of that, but it makes you want to.

074325144X|5.0|If you run or want to run. If you worry about getting an injury or if you already have an injury but dont want to make it worse. This this book will more than likely be beneficial to you. It teaches you that running, if done correctly, maintaining the correct form and posture, will never cause an injury to your body. After reading the book I agree. I walk to work everday for around an hour, I used to suffer from shin splints, and acheing knees, but I thought this was normal, after reading this book and following its points, I can walk for much longer, I get less tired, I am less out of breath, I dont get shin splints and my knees no longer give me any trouble. Basically, my legs can take me much further with less effort. I have also taken up jogging/running and am very confident with the knowledge from this book. I know that as long as I stick to its points, I can continue running and walking for years with out any worry of an injury.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I work in a retail establishment and often saw customers wearing black \\"Wicked\\" t-shirts.  One day I asked about the show and, hearing it was good, I decided to buy the CD.  I am a big fan of musicals and was excited to explore something new to me. When the CD arrived I immediately popped it into my computer. The music exceeded my expectations.  The score is full of energy and drama and I greatly enjoy singing along.  Idina Menzel's voice is so spectacular (as Elphaba) I can't get enought of it!  Kristin Chenoweth (as Galinda) has a quirky but likeable voice and the rest of the cast is strong as well.  Although I was able to glean bits of  the story line from the music, I have decided to read the book now to fill in the gaps.  I hope to see the actual show when it comes my way in August!  This CD is a MUST HAVE for all musical lovers and should become a \\"classic\\" over time.

B000BUYP4Q|4.0|Having watched all of the batman videos, this one is my favorite. The two disc contains the movie and a hilarious 'tankman' spoof on one disc, special features on the other. The special features weren't that spectacular unless you are really interested in all the behind the scenes shooting, a lot of it is the director talking about his plans/ideas for the movie and how they came to be. The building of the batmobile was fairly interesting and filming of some of the stunts, most of it however was just 'filler' to me. I would get the two disc set just for the tankman spoof, which was a great shout out by SNL.
0307276902|5.0|The book provides some very vivid images of what drug addiction can be all about - it's a grim picture! So, Frey embellished it quite a bit, maybe he should have not done so, but he did. I would not dump the book because Frey - and his publisher it seems - failed to apply all the acid tests so many people were so eager to volunteer as an afterthought! I have seen rivalries and envy in many human endeavours, but I had never seen so many people gang up on a single person as I have seen in the past few weeks in the case of Frey and A Million Little Pieces. Regardless, the book is worth the price and the time to read it.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Splendidly done science fiction of the space opera catagory, Serenity essentially encapsulates the entire season of the \\"Firefly\\" TV show -- but it has a true beginning, middle, and end. It isn't an epic film, it isn't a trendsetter, it is simply a very well done story that has humor, plot, humanity, and some nice puzzles. The only \\"bad\\" part: there won't be a sequel.

0385513755|4.0|I'll admit it: I liked the premise of the story and history that went into this novel. And yes, the first couple of pages really sucked me in...<br /><br />One thing I found annoying: Dan Brown tends to use a slightly patronizing tone - repeating unnecessarily the most obvious \\"hints\\" that are key to plot development. What makes a really good mystery novel (and a really good movie, natch) is the fact that you have to THINK about what comes next - and sometimes, draw your own conclusions. The author shouldn't have to spell it out for you.<br /><br />Yes, some parts were preposterous (the bank scene, the end chase scene, etc.) But overall, it's a great time-filler and a fast-paced, interesting story.

B000002KO1|5.0|LOL, I almost started with \\"the CD that changed my life\\"... nope, not exactly, this was Sire Records' yellow label 33 rpm of vinyl bliss.  If I hadnt discovered the Pretenders, wow... where would I be?  It's almost like an \\"Its a Wonderful Life\\" scenario... go back in time to see me at a Michael Bolton concert, DeBarge or Winger, who knows???  It's frightening to contemplate, even now. <br /> <br />I bought this album when I was 14 and listened to it every day for a month, and hundreds of times since.  I couldnt get enough of it.  It's just so GREAT and so FUN, I really found myself in this record.  I still remember the nonsensical liner note that somehow made sense: 'this record has a longer playing length than most albums, so for maximum effect, PLAY THIS RECORD LOUD!'  I did.  Believe me, I did. <br /> <br />All the songs are great, Chrissie's vocals and tough girl lyrics, the hooks and solos by Honeyman-Scott... what a loss his death was.  Looking back I see this record as a milestone, one that really re-defined Rock n Roll, which lets face it, needs to be continually re-defined and updated.   <br /> <br />As far as the songs, Mystery Achievement is a song I carry with me every day, to this day, what a great rhythm, riffs, lyrics, unreal.  Brass in Pocket, the cool little single that put the band on the map.  Kid, the touching but catchy ballad.  Lovers of Today, the slow, smooth perfect makeout tune back in the day :).  The gritty Up the Neck, so sexy and upfront, and my personal fave Tattooed Love Boys, such a kicka$$ tune that was unlike anything I had ever heard up to that point.  I could go on and on..... <br /> <br />But of course, the Pretenders are a group in name only, it's always been all about Chrissie.  She is simply the coolest chick ever, the true leader of the band, no one else around at the time could even carry her leather jacket. <br /> <br />I can't emphasize enough... my highest rating. <br /> <br />

There are chick flicks, and there are guy flicks, and this one is both.  My wife thought the guys were hot, and I thought the action was great.     <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, Clint Eastwod westerns are good, John Wayne is good, but this movie was one we both thoroughly enjoyed.
B000BRBA8S|2.0|I adored In The Mood For Love.  It was a romantic and visual masterpiece.  2046, it's sequal on the other hand is a scattered, disjointed mess with the most heartless and self centered lead character I've ever seen in a so called romantic film.  I get it....this man has loved one woman so much that he can't love another....unfortunately that doesn't make for an interesting film.  Not to mention it is painfully slow and redundant....BORING.  I can't even recommend this film for its' visuals.  2046 doesn't compare to the beautiful In The Mood For Love on any level.  If you see it it will only take away from your opinion of the first film.  Don't waste your time.

B00000JLWW|5.0|It's no surprise that Titanic won 2 Academy Awards including Best Picture! James Cameron is simply brilliant! He perfectly combines a true love story with a tragic disaster. Although over 3 hours long, this movie is so captivating. The cast is superb with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet giving outstanding performances as Jack and Rose. The poor guy and the rich girl romance is very touching. I personally think that BILLY ZANE, who plays Cal in the movie, should have been nominated for an award for his spectacular performance!!!! He added so much to this movie. Without him, the movie would not have been the same. The movie was perfectly casted and the special effects were bar none. Of course, no one will ever forget the \\"I'm The King Of The World\\" quote made famous by Jack in the movie. The first half is a true love story until the unthinkable happens and Titanic hits an iceberg in the North Atlantic. From that moment on, it's a heart pounding race to see who will survive and who won't. We see so many souls lose their lives and it makes us think of the terror these people went through who were on the real Titanic ship. This is truly a movie that touches you in many ways. We see Jack freeze to death in the icy waters and Rose hanging on for her life promising Jack that she'll never let go. The movie also gave us the beautiful song by Celine Dion... My Heart Will Go On. A song no one will ever forget for it will forever remind us of Titanic and true love. It's not a wonder why Titanic has been called the most popular movie of all time. James Cameron touched everyone's heart from beginning to end. The film ends as the \\"old\\" Rose falls peacefully asleep in her warm bed after finally letting go of the Heart Of The Ocean necklace she had kept to herself all those years. We realize she dies in her sleep and is then reunited with Jack standing in front of the clock and all the other people who lost their lives in this tragedy. They can finally be together forever.I wouldgive this film more than 5 stars if I could. A true masterpiece that will never be forgotten and will always remain a classic and one of the best films ever made. It could not have been done better. I suggest everyone buy it and treasure it for years to come.
0385507755|1.0|The messages of the book, including the intensity of the suffering involved, touched me deeply and I found it both provocative and enlightening.  The publicity about the dishonesty involved, however, affects my ability to thoroughly recommend this book to others.  I would suggest that Frye still suffers from addictions of yet another sort.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|This is one of the greatest, most original and unique albums ever made from one of the best, if not the best groups out there right now IMO. Hypnotize for me is the stronger half of the double album, being less commercially accessible, but with deeper, more complex music and lyrics. I really like the more melodic approach System is heading towards. At the same time it is a lot more experimental with different types of sounds.<br /><br />Wow does this one grow on you with every listen. I pick up new subtle riffs, beats, or harmonizing each time I listen to this disc. I think it's a shame so many people can't appreciate this album and band. On one hand you have the people who never gave System a chance for whatever shallow reason, but then even worse you have those System fans that don't like the latest stuff because Daron is singing more and/or they're moving away from that harder punk-metal sound.<br /><br />At first I was on the anti-Daron bandwagon until I realized his voice honestly isn't bad at all, I was just afraid of change as most fans were. Forget all that BS about Daron trying to take over the band and all that drama. System are like brothers, and Serj and Daron are just exploring new sound, together. There is no animosity. Daron's voice adds a whole new element to System's sound, and his singing summons emotions Serj's voice isn't capable of. Honestly, once you get over that immature approach and appreciate the new beautiful harmonizing between Daron and Serj you'll realize just how talented and innovative these guys are.<br /><br />Anyway, this album has a really trippy sound to it. It almost sounds like they wrote this while on coke and shrooms for lack of a better explanation. This album just has this gloomy mechanical feel. There are fast hard tracks, and really spiritual ones. Every song is passionate, and some extremely odd.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the music I listen to other than SOAD: Pantera, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Sublime, 311, Snot, Beatles, Floyd, Nirvana, Tool, Soulfly, Black Label Society, Sabbath. Basically classic rock, grunge, heavy metal, some indie punk, the occasional street punk, reggae, even some older rap I can appreciate, whatever, pretty much the goods from every genre and era, you get the idea.<br /><br />So to those with a good ear for music here's the song by song while I listen to the CD. 9 is the best score possible, but 10 is for the masterpieces.<br /><br />1. Attack 9/10 - Pretty aggressive song with good harmonizing parts, cool lyrics. Fast and hard, gets you pumped and ready for the cd. Serj's vocals on this one exclusively. Great drumming. Really badass riffing by Daron to fast drums.<br /><br />2. Dreaming 10/10 - My personal favorite. This song has a hard hitting verse with Serj singing 2 overlapping lines and Daron doing distorted backup on one of them, it's intense and very cool. Nice choruses sounds great with both dudes singing. Sputtering and chugging guitars. The last line in the song sounds so amazing with Serj's voice and Daron doing this beautiful backup harmonizing. Check it out.<br /><br />3. Kill Rock n' Roll 9/10 - Catchy, poppy format, but with the SOAD touch to turn it into gold. Overall a very solid song.<br /><br />4. Hypnotize 9/10 - This song has a really cool, unique sound to it. All the bass, tar and drums have a real eastern feel. Otherwise this song has a pretty simple structure, but Serj's voice is excellent.<br /><br />5. Stealing Society 9/10 - Oh this one is great. Serj sings real trippy followed by Daron singing a quirky verse, they both do a great job.<br /><br />6. Tentative 10/10 - Some of the deepest and best lyrics I've heard on the verse, Serj sings it awesome too. Song breaks down into this beautiful dual harmonzing between Daron and Serj, then explodes again. This song is real passionate, so great. Give it a good listen.<br /><br />7. U-Fig 9/10 - More great harmonizing by Daron and Serj, with a great part with a beautiful chill riff contrasting with screaming vocals. Real great soulful ending.<br /><br />8. Holy Mountains 10/10 - This is such a great song with a great eastern feel typical of most System's softer, if not most, songs. Real spiritual vocals from Serj that bursts into dual harmonizing with Daron. Very heartfelt and genuine singing about the Armenian Genocide. Serj's voice is just amazing, and Daron's screaming and melodic backup parts are as well. Shavo and John are absolutely GENIUS on this one.<br /><br />9. Vicinity of Obscenity 10/10 - This is incredibly catchy. Just one of those classics with replay value like Sugar that you can blast anytime. Nuts song choice especially after the emotion of the previous song.<br /><br />10. She's like Heroin 9/10 - A lot of people don't like this song. I think Daron sounds pretty cool but what makes the song great is Serj's background harmonizing (you gotta listen for it) and some of the best bass. Tension building at the end breaks down into the next one.<br /><br />11. Lonely Day 9/10 - I think Daron does this one very well, and he goes great with some beautiful guitar and an amazing solo to boot. Heard the song is mocking emo or something, but no emo can pull off this kind of musicianship, end of story. It's a great song simply put whether it's like anything System have done or not. And about the bad grammar, it's obviously for a deeper reason if not to show how people will grumble and moan about it over the songwriting. People fall right for it.<br /><br />12. Soldier Side 10/10 - Masterpiece. Great lyrics, instruments, very passionate vocals. Could not have closed this double disc with a better song. They should win an award for this one.<br /><br />Overall one of the best cds ever. My personal favorite SOAD cd thus far. Melody, vocals, and tons of subtle layers of lyrical meaning and music to uncover. Enjoy.th a beautiful chill riff contrasting with screaming vocals. Real great soulful ending. <br /> <br />8.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|Our family wore out a VCR copy of The Muppet Christmas Carol. This replacement DVD is even better!
630469654X|5.0|I saw this movie over Christmas.  Even though it is an older title, this is the first time I'd seen it.  Excellent.  Great cast, very funny and happy ending.  I was glad to see Rutgar Hauer as the good guy since he's usually cast as the villain.
B0000033P0|4.0|If you are considering buying this CD, you are most likely of the \\"old school\\", like myself, and are simply replacing your worn out vinyl albums with CD's. If that's the case, you need no description of the music and already know how great these guys are.  My two favorite ELP records are \\"Tarkus\\" and \\"Trilogy\\", and of the two, \\"Tarkus\\" is really the foundation of the ELP sound.  This album is where the power of their live show is captured best in the title track. If you were ever lucky enough to see them in their prime, as I was, \\"Tarkus\\" live just stunned the audience. It was the definition of \\"prog rock\\"... part hard rock, part classical music, part jazz, and completely different!  These guys drew the map that inspired bands like Rush and countless others. However, if you are NOT familiar with these guys you might want to start with \\"Trilogy\\".  The only reason I give this CD four stars instead of five is that I rate against everybody, not just against themselves. For a well-rounded classic rock collection this is a must!
B00006RCNW|4.0|This is a wonderfully unique and great show!  It is so full of surprises.  I really enjoy the fact that it is on a cable chanell, but not HBO, and it is chock full of sex and over the top violence.  There is a great deal of swearing and \\"sex-capades\\" which are quite arousing, while at the same time make for an interesting mix of a story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this story, evenmore than other network TV dramas, such as NYPD Blue, for its rawness and over the top antics by its star, Michael Chilkis.  His is just wonderful in the starring role.<br /><br />I give it two aroused thumbs up!!!
B000E1155E|4.0|The Arctic Monkeys are four 20 year old Englishmen who have exploded on the British music scene.  Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I Am Not became the fastest selling debut album in British music history.  The album is very Anglo-centric and the question is will it play well in America.  It should as it is a smart, tight collection of songs that draws on everyone from the Jam to The Kinks to The Strokes to The Libertines while sounding quite original in its own right.  \\"I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor\\" is a high powered single while \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" is a smart and strong track.  \\"Fake Tales of San Francisco\\" and \\"Maybe Vampires Is a Bit Strong\\" both take on the music press with a scathing tone.  \\"A Certain Romance\\" is a more restrained song compared to the barrel straight ahead style of the rest of the album.  The band's motto is don't believe the hype, but thanks to this sterling debut, they come pretty close to doing just that.
0060536357|4.0|The story was very interesting and i couldn't put the book down.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|The Constant Gardener is one of the most surprising films I've seen in the last six months. For whatever reason, it gets miscategorized as a political thriller. Instead, this is a love story in context of international conspiracy. Much like Hostel is sold as an anti-capitalist film (it's really just a gore fest, to my delight), It's All Gone Pete Tong is sold as a club raver film (it's really a sappy drama about losing your hearing) and Crash is sold as a comment on racism (it's really just overrated), I hope this film doesn't get confused with its background. <br /> <br />Tessa (Weisz) is a smart, beautiful young activist who is driven by ideals and emotions. Justin (Fiennes) is a shy, patient, soft-spoken diplomat who abides by the rules religiously and tends to his garden the way he tends toward life: carefully pick out the bad and nurture the good. The two end up on a collision course of love and life. <br /> <br />In Africa, Tessa is murdered, and the film spends the majority exploring through flashbacks and jumps, how Justin must deal with the death, his work, her life, and what his life means to himself and everyone else. His colleagues and friends become enemies. He trusts no one. Does he even trust his wife? Is she who he thinks she is?  <br /> <br />What Justin discovers is more far-reaching than he ever could imagine: Justin discovers that his own life is worth living beyond the borders he has put up.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|It's FINALLY out!! Best musical movie I've ever seen (aside from Phantom of the Opera, 2004 version). I looove RENT so much, it's a wonderful message, really heartfelt and it hits close to home. A story of friends living the bohemian life in NYC circa 1989-1990 and most everyone in the clan has AIDS. Amazingly, now that I think back (and watch it again), the only real bit of comic relief that I can remember is Mark and Roger's answering machine's repetitive-ness: SPEEEEAAK gets me every time. :) At first when I went to see it, I didn't think I would like the movie very much, it looked too into the rock-music for me to enjoy. But I was (obviously and thankfully) mistaken. The music was wonderful and the parts were played by the seasoned Broadway actors who originated them (except Mimi/Dawson and Joanne/Thoms). Everyone's performances were the most believable that I have ever seen, probably because they've been so comfortable in them for so many years. I surprised myself as I felt tears running down my face at the end; I didn't think it had had that big of an impact on me. Wrong again.<br /><br />The few things I warn about: make sure whoever is seeing this movie is... mature. There are a gay couple and a lesbian couple, a few F-bombs and someone gets mooned. Not too bad, you get used to the couples after seeing them long enough, and the F-bomb is... twice, in the same song. That's about it, I hope you enjoy it. No day but today, so go see it now! :)
B000AP04OM|5.0|Just wonderful!!! Absolutely wonderful!!! For the timeframe of when I remember this enchanting musical, I cannot think of anything better to bring you back to when this movie was first released. How it went from a film that would be considered overbudget and a risk to one of the most beloved of all time!!    Everyone pretty much knows the screen adaptation of the life of Maria Augusta Von Trapp, who went from a postulate with a true desire to give her life in service to God, to becoming the mother of 7 children plus 3 more of her own.     But without taking away from any of the beauty and majesty of this film, there is a harshness in the reality of Maria's real life that is presented in the second disc of this 2-disc offering. That was the part that I became intensely interested in because what Hollywood tends to do is take \\"creative\\" license with any story and fit it into whatever fits the mold they want, regardless of the truth. The truth here was rather sobering, and even though I absolutely love this movie, I now know how far away the reality was taken, and how much Hollywood created.      The packaging is of 2 DVD's with the first being the movie itself. Vivid, pure colors with incredible sound. The majesty of the Austrian mountains and villages as well as the story that pulls on the heartstrings and gives you moments to pause and admire. Disc one starts with a commercial about DVD piracy, then goes into a short commercial about purchasing other musical classics available. You are given a short introduction by the ever-elegant Ms. Andrews, who is as gracious and beautiful and charming as always, and then you are brought to the movie.    But it is in the second DVD that we are given much more to enjoy and ponder in both how the movie was made and the realities of how real life was tranformed into reel life.   It goes as such:    1)  My favorite things: Julie Andrews remembers  2)  Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer reminiscence  3)  On location with The Soundof Music  4)  From Liesl to Gretl: A 40th anniversary reunion  5)  When you know the notes to sing: a sing-a-long phenomenon  6)  A&E Biography: The Von Trapp Family, Harmony and Discord  7)  Restoration comparison  8)  Mia Farrow screen test   9)  Trailers and TV spots  10) Still galleries    It is in this second DVD that you you are treated to how this magnificent, family-friendly movie was made from start to finish. What a story you will be given! Just to mention one story without giving away much, I had always heard that Christopher Plummer had been difficult during the filming, and that he didn't really like working with kids, but because it was rumor, you couldn't pay it much mind. Well, in this documentary, he admits that he was \\"a boor... difficult\\" during the initial part of the filming, and that he agreed with W.C. Fields in that he also liked children....cooked. He also had initial disdain for the movie in that he called it \\"The Sound of Mucas\\". During this documentary, the fact that he didn't try to hide behind the truth was an interesting insight. Even in the interview that was done with the children, now as adults, they said they knew even back then, that Plummer didn't like them. But Plummer did save himself during the interview, in saying that he eventually came to appreciate the kids. How nice.    For me, the most incredible part of the second disc was the A&E Biography. The Maria in the movie was just a slight shadow of the personality of the real-life Maria Von Trapp, who seemed to be a tortured soul all her life. When Maria's mother died at the fragile age of three, and her father abandoned her, she was left with her guardian uncle, who was physically abusive. She became a precocious child who lived carefree, but one day, she decided to go into a church near her home, and wondering what people were doing who were going into the confessional, found her salvation after three hours of talking to the priest. Wanting to become a nun, and finally feelthe life of being within a \\"family\\", she tried to live the life of a postulate, but the Reverand Mother realizing Maria's zeal for life, turned her instead to the role of governess for the Von Trapp family. Her love for the Captain, and his desire to support the family, were immensely distorted in the film. Also, Maria's issues with control, and the childrens issues with their subserviance to her, led to a great deal of sadness and despair, which makes for the sobering reality of the real life of Maria Von Trapp. It does not change the beauty of the movie, but you certainly realize how far removed the movie was from the truth. Suffice it to say that liberal license was taken with the story.    This movie itself is pure joy and comfort, and it is just perfect. But it is the insight into how it was made, and the story of the real Maria, that makes for a more pensive thought.
B000BM3ZUE|4.0|The Giant's second album gets a very nice remaster courtesy of Repertoire Records. While \\"Taste\\" still shows the band searching for their own style on a couple of tracks the overall impact of the album is impressive from the opening track \\"Pantagruel's Nativity\\" with it's layered harmonies to the closing track \\"Plain Truth\\". The CD comes in a replica of the original album packaging including the gatefold sleeve, a lyric sheet and an essay by Chris Welch on the flipside of the lyric sheet. As with the original release the lyrics are reproduced along with a band photo on the inside of the gatefold sleeve as well.<br /><br />The remastered sound is terrific (although the original CD release sounded pretty good too). I didn't see any notes (as with \\"Tall Tale\\" aka \\"Gentle Giant\\" the band's first album)indicating that there was any restoration done on the second album. Evidently the original mastertape for that first album suffered some sort of damage requiring Repertoire to do some work on it prior to remastering it for CD. Highly recommended for Giant fans this set is limited to an edition of 3000 copies (not that I think it will sell out any time soon but Giant fans should snatch it up asap!).
0375703861|2.0|For about 1/3 of the book, the stories seemed to flow really well.  After a while, I had a pretty hard time getting through the book.  My biggest issue is her misinformation on Jehovah's Witnesses.  As someone who's mother is one, I know for a fact that most of what she wrote about them is totally incorrect, and downright demeaning.  You don't have to like or even tolerate someone of another religion, but at least get your facts straight before writing about them.

B000E33VWW|5.0|Director Bennett Miller has done a terrific job of creating a deep sense of foreboding and impending doom in his re-telling of the story of Truman Capote (Phillip Seymour Hoffman in a tour-de-force performance) and his relationship with the convicted Clutter family murderers, Perry Smith (an intense Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino).<br /><br />Be forewarned though, \\"Capote\\" is not a filmic love letter to Truman Capote and his Jet Set cronies. This is a blunt, peeling away of the glamour that was the Capote persona and what Bennett comes up with is not pleasant...but it is honest and straightforward and for this Bennett is to be congratulated.<br /><br />Hoffman, as opposed to say Charlize Theron's quasi-performance in \\"Monster,\\" not only takes on the manner and physical attributes of Capote but he also inhabits and reveals the heart (hard) and soul (decayed) of the man responsible for the breath-taking, \\"In Cold Blood.\\" But at what price to all involved: Smith, Hickock, FBI agent Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), close friend Harper Lee (a very subdued, Catherine Keener)?<br /><br />\\"Capote\\" is a brilliant, shining example of deadly honest film making done at the very highest level. It is physically, psychically and mentally beautiful and like a fine old Burgundy it is meant to be consumed with as much commitment as it took to create it.

I returned the book and got a refund.
038572179X|1.0|I'd like to start this post by saying that I in absolutely no way blame my book club for my utter loathing of Ian McEwan. I read up on Atonement prior to purchasing it and honestly believed that it would be a book I would enjoy. As it was an interesting premise, I was very interested in where the book would go thematically. <br /> <br />That being said, the book went NOWHERE!!! All I have to ask Ian McEwan is: Why would you put someone through this for no goddamn reason? Bastard.  <br /> <br />The writing style annoyed the crap out of me (I hate highly detailed accounts in which the details are extraneous, unpurposeful and, at times, utterly random), but I pushed through thinking that it was all going to illuminate some concept at the end. But, no. Mr. McEwan simply likes to torture his readers with details which, in the end, mean nothing. Why would you call a book Atonement when, obviously, there is none to be had? Briony, who supposedly was trying to atone for the wrong she did her sister, didn't even really try to do so (vengeance against the person who you SHOULD have accused when you committed your sin is not atonement). <br /> <br />Mr. McEwan now needs to find a time machine so that he can inform me not to waste my time on his useless novel; then I could have finished The Historian.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|This is a must buy film for any sci-fi fan, or any film fan. After the dreary Star Wars prequels, Serenity is a breath of fresh air. Visually stunning, well acted, and a cracking story are still second to Joss Whedon's lightning dialogue. You'll be quoting this one for years. <br />The only thing letting this down are standard DVD features, but its the film you're buying. So buy it. Everybody. Then they'll make another one!!!
0307276902|1.0|Sadly - right after I started reading the book, the story came out about the author fabricating some of it or most of it - or whatever the case may be.  I stopped reading it when the report first aired because I wanted to find out the truth before I continued.  Once I learned that it really is a lot of lies - I have no interest in reading the book.  I had heard it was great, but I no longer want to read it.  He should have published it as a work of fiction & this wouldn't have happened.

This must surely be one of their quality wise most consistent albums! <br />Indeed, this is a (re)new(ed) Supertramp... and what an improvement at that! If someone would have said this is a new group I'd have said it is a crossover between Steely Dan and Supertramp. <br /> <br />A recipe for high quality, terrific sounding music, if you ask me.

I can honestly say that this CD does not have one track that I didn't like.
0790729601|5.0|I'm sure many people will agree with me when I say this is the best performance of Arnold. Surely you'd think... nah, his best is for the Terminator series although these movies are more pure special effects. I recommend this movie for purchase.
6305364648|5.0|This is a mustsee movie. If you're looking for a nice comedy in wich you can also enjoy great action this is for you. One of the finest performances of Arnold. Don't skip this one... if you feel to it, rent it first but you won't regret buying it.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|One of Madonna's BEST CD's in a very long time.  If you are a Madonna fan this cd is a must have.
B000069HJI|4.0|Not too many bands come through with their originality and talent like Supertramp can.  And I will always remember this band's unique flare for mellowing me whenever I need to rethink a hard day.  Their music plays on even after the cd player is done and we are left with a profound - yet comfortable silence. I would love to see them in concert just once -- outside where the earth and sky surround Supertramp's fine musicians.  I'm sure they have ties with nature and all it's surprises. Jennifer
B000068FXR|4.0|Supertramp has a wit that is unmatched...a calling to put words and instruments to use with their heartfelt insight and appreciation for the humourous side of life.  Supertramp always reminds me to LIGHTEN UP.  I love 'em.  Jennifer
6304698798|5.0|I only bought this movie because it is one the of the best Cowbowys movies ever. The first 15 minutes are just amazing, without any dialogue but only defiant looks. I would recommend it to old movies lovers and classic collectors. Take a careful look to the direction and the outstanding casting. And of course, the unmistakable music composed by Ennio Morricone, in my opinion one of the best music composers. Enjoy it!
B0000TG9E2|4.0|Thank God for Disney releasing completely restaured Dvds of its greatest classics! <br />Alice is one of the best movies Disney released during its Golden Years. The dvd treatment here is fantastic: the colors are bright, image sharp as ever. <br />Alice is bored with the real world, and she wants things to be a bit different.To her surprise, she finds a running rabbit wearing a red coat, and carrying a big watch.She decides to follow him, out of mere curiosity. The rest of the story is very well known to everyone, but this DVD makes it very fresh and enjoyable. The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is well... the Oyster scene. It is a bit off topic and doesn't quite fit with the rest of the story.Also, the Ugly Duchess was not included in the film, which is one of my favorite characters from the book.They should have cut out the Oyster story instead! <br />However, this dvd is a MUST HAVE for sure.
B0002OXVDW|4.0|This is a lovely way to voyage down memory lane in brief snippets from many wonderful films.  If you can't afford to have all of their movies in your library, what better way to enjoy the elegance of Fred Astaire or the athleticism of Gene Kelly; or to tune in to Katheryn Grayson or Judy Garland or so many fine performers.  I had seen the first two of these films, but I really love having the whole collection, and I'm sure I'll be enjoying all of these discs many times over!
0792833201|5.0|Let's face it, there aren't too many good scary movies we can sit and watch with our kids.  Leave it to Spielberg to hit the mark! <br />This great movie leads on the line of supernatural horror that leaves tingles on your spine and does it with your typical skeletons, slimes, and toys that \\"come alive\\".  There is no reason you have to really cover your kids ears or eyes.  Perfect family horror entertainment!  I wish a few more would be made like this one.  It's great!

0780622650|2.0|One would think that this \\"Lost In Space\\" would have kept closer to the storyline.  However, the storyline was poor and the actors were nothing to brag about.  I found myself turning away when certain characters came on because they were so annoying.   <br />This film is worth buying to entertain your kids in desparation.  That's really it!
B000002WYT|5.0|It's strong, mellow, and moving.  \\"Crash,\\" \\"41\\", and \\"Too Much,\\" have all been played--sometimes too much, but still the cuts endure.  A good album and a solid contribution to any collection.
0596009208|4.0|That's my opinion in a nutshell about the Head First Series of computer books. I like this book, and the other 3 that I own, a lot. I didn't give it 5 stars because this review is for you. People learn differently and have expectations to meet their needs. This book is informative, interactive and upbeat. It provokes thought and problem-solving by continously prompting your brain to give input. When you're done - you know Java and a lot of subtle nuances.  <br /> <br />I realize this is a \\"soft\\" review. There are some hardcore people who want to know \\"will it talk about this or that?\\" The simple answer is \\"yes.\\" It begins by assuming you've done some programming, not just HTML. It's jammed tight with important information. So if you use a highlighter, put it down and get a paint brush. This is not a \\"linear\\" book written for the person who wants to read and memorize references. Java is a language and its taught by engaging the reader into a mental dialogue. It's fun. You won't fall asleep. You'll learn a lot. But more importantly, you'll remember even more.  <br /> <br />How can you go wrong with a tech book that has code, ducks and Java crossword puzzles? Better know your stuff baby or read the book because it comes with a mantra, \\"Release Your Code.\\" How did it work for me? Shh...5 stars!
0316172324|4.0|This is an excellent pamphlet that has been expanded to book length.  It is unfortunate that at about half-way the author begins repeating concepts previously presented.  The concept, however, is excellent, and provides a brilliant glimpse into the way we all make decisions.  If, after reading the first half of this book, you do not think about how you think, you are not thinking!
6305263248|4.0|Well done. The life of the modern Ronin. All hired operatives coming together, unknown to each other what true motives the others have for recovering the case. Deniro, Jean Reno from\\"The Professional\\" and another foreign film called, \\"The Crimson Rivers\\" (special cop, murder mystery film, good stuff), the guy from Thrid Watch on tv, etc. And of course Katarina Witt if only for a short while! Good all around well cast movie, well directed, Frankenheimer,  well shot. It's in my permanent collection. But I'm a little biased with the story of, \\"The 47 Ronin.\\" Enjoyable watch.
0307276902|1.0|It was a good book until the media coverage hit.  A good way to make a buck until you get caught!
0743454537|2.0|I was intrigued by the theme of this novel and the ethical questions it raised but was disapointed at how thin the story turned out to be. <br /> <br />A. Anna sues her parents for wanting her to keep donating platelets, bone marrow, vital organs to her terminally ill sister.  <br />B. They go to court, lawyer battles it out with mom - who is also a lawyer.  <br />C. Decision is issued by the court (no spoilers!)  <br />D. Sudden twist in the end that conveniently allows the family to avoid addressing the ethical questions this story raised in the 1st place. <br /> <br />Other than the predictable tension among the family members and Anna's sister going in-out of the hospital there are no major twists in the plot that hook you in.  Snapshots on the lives of the supporting cast of characters are given - Anna's rebel brother, her lawyer with the \\"mysterious\\" condition which is not that big a deal if you speak to many people with the same condition, the lawyers ex-girlfriend, the ex-girlfriends's twin sister who turns out to be gay (hello?).  What these have to do with the major issue at hand is anyones guess. These little additions to the story seem like weak attempts to add some meat and a few more chapters to the book.  But they only serve to distract rather than add depth to the entire thing. <br /> <br />I was really prepared to like this book and be moved by its characters. Perhaps my expectations were too high, after being so intrigued with the theme.  I kept waiting for something to hook me into the story but instead I kept wanting to skip over to the next chapter and remained dissatisfied till the end.  Save yourself the time and read the back cover + the last two chapters.  That's all there is to this novel.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I love this show and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD!
B000E0WJIC|3.0|Initially this album kinda blew me away with the production value and nice combination of '80s Brit-style soloing and Swedes-inspired riffage.  But unfortunately, the album doesn't stand up to repeat listens.  I agree with most of the criticisms I see around here regarding the uninspired lyrics and whiny lead vocalist.  However, both vocalists have nice metal screams which alleviates the situation a little bit.  And the guitar play is very good, excellent at times.  I'd like to say that \\"All These Things I Hate\\" is one of the worst excuses for a metal song I have heard in my life.  Check out the album if you can get it for 10 bucks or less.  Otherwise, it's not worth it.

0060254920|5.0|This book is a terrific alternative idea for birthday party themes.  For my 5 yr old's party, all the children made animal masks & then got in a circle as I read the book.  Then at the end, we had music & they got to jump around like wild things and that led to wild things freeze dance.  I bought a copy of the book for all the children that attended as their party favor.
0307276902|2.0|Nicely crafted. Good read. To bad it tried to claim the status of an accurate autobiography.
0307276902|5.0|I absolutely loved this book,in spite of how it was taken or written.I am sorry that some of the things that happened was made up, but it actually held my attention like no other book has in a long time. I felt that I was actually there with James in this place he had to be in.
0060899190|4.0|This book is, for those of us who love postsecret.com, simply more of what we love.  However, the book binding doesn't allow the book to open flat, and several postcards are formatted to fit across both pages, so there is often a chunk of card that you can't see in the middle. At the very least, the effect is lost on several postcards purely because you're annoyed. Still, can't beat the content.
B00004XONN|5.0|I can't even explain how much Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" moves and inspires me.  As not to ramble on about how excellent this album is, here are my scores for each song. <br /> <br />1. Everything In Its Right Place- 10/10 great keyboards and brilliant vocal from Thom Yorke <br />2. Kid A- 8/10 by no means a bad song; I just don't enjoy this one as much as the others.  A great quiet song <br />3. The National Anthem- 9/10 awesome weird song with a lot of cool spacy jazz near the end. <br />4. How To Disappear Completely- 10/10 great relaxing, slow song. Not much to be said except that this is a brilliant song. <br />5. Treefingers- 7/10 gloriously strange noise \\"instrumental\\", good for spacing out. <br />6. Optimistic- 11/10 excellent fast paced song.  My second favorite on the album and the first I ever liked off of Kid A <br />7. In Limbo- 200/10 one of my favorite Radiohead songs EVER.  Great intro, intersting instrumentals, and awesome quiet vocal from Yorke.  Very unpredictable and brilliant. <br />8. Idioteque- 9/10 A hit off of Kid A if I'm not mistaken.  Just really cool, not much more to say.  I can't really even describe this song, but it's great. <br />9. Morning Bell- 8/10 Personally, I prefer Amnesiac's version of this song but this one's cool too. <br />10. Motion Picture Soundtrack- 10/10 kinda hard to get into at first, but once this grew on me it became one of my favorites <br /> <br />Kid A does require patience, but I believe that this may very well be one of the best albums in the last 20 years.  Any Radiohead CD is worth 10 bucks, but this one may be my favorite.
B000E8N690|2.0|Grade:C    Who forgot to tell these directors that you can only sit and watch people muck up their lives for UNDER 2 HOURS?    Yes, you read correctly. Johnny Cash mucks up his life for an entire 2 hours of the movie. Well, maybe 110 minutes.    Plus, the photography switched from looking like an amateur hand-held job to looking like Joaquian Phoenix (sp?) was a mad bull released on the set and the camera guy had to keep a closeup on him while J. Phoenix ravaged the set.    However, this movie did give you a much better understanding of the late Johnny Cash. While I didn't care too much for parts of the movie, he is still a great singer and Reese Witherspoon and J. Phoenix do a good job with their roles.    I also believe that Reese Witherspoon's Oscar for this movie was 200% deserved and -although I didn't see CAPOTE- I think Joaquin Phoenix should have won here.

6304696515|5.0|The first scene is called Battle Dress.  Need I say more.  The actors all all great but you could literally turn off the sound and still enjoy the wonderful visual spectacle that is the costuming in this film.
B00005K9LN|5.0|In 1980, the musical landscape was going through some big changes. Punk rock and disco were considered dead, and new wave music was gaining popularity. However, in the U.K., a new musical scene was emerging: heavy metal. Many bands came out in this time period including Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Diamond Head, Angel Witch, Witchfinder General, and of course Judas Priest. Now, the band had been around for years, but this was when they started gaining more mainstream recognition. In fact, many people credit Judas Priest for influencing the whole British metal scene. On this album, the band went for a more commercial sound that was hinted at on their previous album, Hell Bent for Leather (1979). However, the band still manages to keep their trademark ass-kicking sound. <br /> <br />The album begins with the speed metal song Rapid Fire. Fast paced guitar riffs start the song, a bit of drum pounding, and Rob Halford growls, \\"Pounding the world, like a battering ram.\\" Very old school speed metal right here. Listening to this song is like someone throwing concrete blocks at your head. Glenn Tipton and KK Downing really display their guitasr abilities well on this album and this song is no exception, the guitar solos they play on here are FAST. The song segues into the more mid-paced Metal Gods. I love the part when Rob sings \\"Fearing for our lives, reaped by robot scythes.\\" And then he starts chanting \\"Metal Gods\\" It may be a slower song, but it is still heavy as hell. Next is Breaking the Law, a very commercial and catchy song that I am sure everyone knows. The riffs on here are just powerful, I really can't get enough of this one. United is VERY anthemic, it's almost impossible not to sing along. This would be an awesome song to hear in concert. Another well known song by the band. Speaking of hits, Living after Midnight is probably one of the most mainstream songs the band has ever made. I can guarantee you that you will drive your family crazy when you sing this one inthe shower. This song is very pop-metal flavored, but it still rocks. I wish more fans would give it a chance. And you know you love that guitar solo! <br /> <br />Grinder is a tough and heavy number. Those riffs are just mean, as is Rob when he growls \\"Grinder looking for the meat, Grinder wants you to eat.\\" Cheesy? Yes but awesome? Hell yeah! Tell me you don't feel like destroying something! You Don't Have to be Old to be Wise is another killer song with a good message. Very catchy and insightful. I love the part in the middle where it seems to quiet down, and then BAM, the guitar solo kicks your ass across the street. The Rage is another mid-paced song, and it is pretty damn heavy. Ian Hill does a nice bass solo at the start. Then a few guitar notes, and then the song really kicks in. Like I said, it is slow but crushing. Guitar players will drool over this one. Steeler is an awesome closer, it is another fast song. Not the speed metal attack of Rapid Fire, but close enough. WICKED guitar solo on this one. I love the end when the band just rocks out, that piece right there is some pretty good old school speed metal. <br /> <br />The bonus tracks are also good. The live version of Grinder rocks (Rob sure can get a crowd going) and Red White and Blue is an unreleased track. It is a very emotional song and even the band admitted that they wanted it to bring a tear to your eye when you heard it. Nice keyboard playing on this one. i wonder why it was never released. <br /> <br />So there you have it. One of the best known albums of the early 80s British heavy metal scene. Anyone who has the slightest interest in heavy metal must buy this album. Ignore the people that say it is \\"too commercial\\" screw that. There are some mainstream tracks, but overall, don't expect anything less than heavy metal. And you gotta love any album that has a razor blade with the words BRITISH STEEL written on it on the cover!

B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Geeze! Talk about an overrated release, by reading some of the reviews on here you would think that this album is one of the greatest of all time. Ok! We get it! You don't like the government nor big cooperations. You know what, neither do I, but give me a break. And what is the deal with Daron singing so much? It fine when he just did backing vocals every now and then but sometimes he is signing more than Serj. This would not be a problem if Daron didn't have one of the most annoying voices ever. It is so high-pitched and nasally, not good at all. This guy has turned into a control freak. He has to write nearly all the songs and now he has to sing more than the actual vocalist! This guy's ego must be massive. This is one of the most overrated pieces of political bull I have ever heard. This band had the potential to become the next big thing but I guess they just didn't have the heart or talent to do so. If you like rehashed songs and political bullsh*t over and over you might like this.
1932100385|5.0|This fine book is a treasure trove of amazingly useful information that will radically change the way that you think about your diet and lifestyle.<br /><br />The first point that I particularly liked is that the author is not a reductionist. He understands that the idea of trying to reduce the value of foods to one food type or one nutrient is deeply flawed. Yes, there is some good evidence that tomato-derived lycopene has a great many health benefits, but that does not mean that the solution to all that ails us is a diet consisting solely of tomatoes. At last count there were over 260 hormones and neurotransmitters involved in the maintenance of body-weight. So trying to manipulate just one of them is hardly likely to be crowned with success.The problem with so many approaches to diet and nutrition is that they lack balance, and fail to see the big picture.<br /><br />T. Colin Campbell is definitely one who sees the big picture, both in terms of his own research, and the broader context. He rightly points out that trying to divorce nutrition from the whole diet and lifestyle is a fundamental mistake.<br /><br />I noticed something rather interesting that I have just seen was also picked up by another reviewer: there seems to be a strongly positive correlation between wheat consumption and the risk of sustaining a myocardial infarction. This is particualrly important in the light of a recent study from Sweden that showed that reducing cereal intake in a group of 24 domesticated pigs led to a sharp increase in insulin sensitivity, and a fall in blood pressure and C-reactive protein.<br /><br />I urge everybody who has any interest at all in nutrition to read this book and read it carefully. It could forever change your relationship with food.

B00005R1N3|5.0|This little gem is the absolute best of the best when it comes to slasher movies.  From begining to end it is suspenseful and creepy.  The characters are developed well and the acting is great.  Hats off to Margot Kidder (Barb).  She is funny, raunchy and just plain amazing.  The rest of the cast, including Olivia Hussey (Jess), Andrea Martin (Phyl) and Marian Waldman (Mrs. Mac)are equally wonderful.  There is not an overabundance of gore, blood,nor a high body count, but if you are in the mood for a great scare, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br />Black Christmas came out in the mid 70s and it pioneered the way for so many other slasher films of the later 70s - present day, hence they are remaking this movie as we speak.  I just hope that they do not screw it up.  I always get a little scared when Hollywood decides to fix something that is not broken to begin with. <br /> <br />The story is set in a sorority house during Christmas time and most of the sorority girls are leaving for the holidays, but a handful of girls stay behind along with their housemother for the break.  A psycho climbs the outside of the house and into the attic of the home, and from that point on chaos ensues.  The girls start to receive obscene phone calls from an anonynous stranger and one of the sorority sisters comes up missing very early in the movie.  You can imagine the rest. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a great scare, check this one out.
B00005MAM2|5.0|EVenthough it has passed many years since it was launched, i thinks this is one of the best animes ever made!!
B00000G3AZ|3.0|This version of Emma was great, until BBC's version came out a year later.  Unfortunately, BBC's Emma didn't get as much recognition because the release date was so close to that of the hollywood version.  Kate Beckinsale is much more convincing as Emma.  Paltrow seemed too stiff and awkward in the role (those who are bigger fans of Paltrow than myself may disagree) but I believe that anyone who has seen both versions will find that Beckinsale is a natural in this role and a pleasure to watch.  I don't want to be too harsh on Gwyneth - but this is not the version you should see if you want a great Austen movie.   <br /> <br />As an avid fan of classic period dramas, I have seen just about every movie and mini-series made.  BBC has always come out with wonderful period pieces - most notably Pride and Prejudice - and the 1997 movie is no exception.  I don't know quite how to describe it, but the pace and feel of the movies made by BBC seem to capture the essence of the period more so than those made in hollywood.   <br /> <br />Kate Beckinsale's Emma is the one to get.  It is a delight to watch again and again. <br /> <br />

B00003CXB2|5.0|Lawrence of Arabia is a classic.  It should be watched by all for the cinemaphotography alone.  Although it is not exactly historically correct it still brings the viewer into the world of middle eastern muslim arabs in a way few westerns will ever see.

B000000XB9|3.0|John Fogarty and CC are excellent. The problem with the album was my realization that they used the same 4/4 beat for every song they ever wrote. Listening to the whole album becomes not so much a joyful experience as a trial to avoid a sense of boredom.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never heard of this series when I encountered it on Amazon but the reviews were consistenly high and so I took a chance and bought it. It was fantastic. I can't believe this show was cancelled. <br />
B000AP04FG|4.0|This is one hilarious action movie!!  The funniest part is the elevator scene after Jolie and Pitt kick ass on the first floor of the department store and then get into the elevator and just wait while elevator music plays for the next floor.  Both actors give stellar performances as high octane, world-class spies who find out they are both each other's targets--their chemistry, already alleged during the filming of the movie, is more than obvious.  It's high adrenaline, high action, high comedic and high romantic.  Everything about this movie is uptempo and freakin' amazing.  Definitely a worthwhile buy.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I bought the television series on DVD and the movie purely on spec - the reviews were consistently fantastic. I was not disappointed - I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as well as the series. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Ok, so they're more like Pirate/Cowboys/Cowgirls in space... But that's besides the point. This series should never have been cancelled. It's probably the best thing Joss Whedon has ever done. Don't get me wrong, I love 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', and 'Angel'... But this series feels more realistic, and has more natural than supernatural qualities to it. Real human struggles and emotions. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. I'll forever be a Brown Coat.

I'ts a really dark recording very appealing but to be honest give me violator, songs of faith and devotion, even ultra anytime over playing the angel.
B00005RDRO|3.0|Cute movie....great actors in an unusual configuration. The Pink Panther Movies with Peter Sellers are better; if you've not seen these actors together, here's your chance....maybe I viewed it on a bad day; it wasn't as funny as I expected.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I was so moved by the movie and bought the sound track - this is the first movie track I've bought and also the first Country music CD I bought. It has some great songs and reminds me of the movie whenever I listen to. <br /> <br />Strongly recommended!
B000002O4S|5.0|Excellent product with classic hits from the movie that you love to sing and dance too. Product was sent in good time and i love it.
B000068CNX|5.0|At the outset, I must confess that I am a big Friends fan. I was in the market for one season, and I chose season two after reading the reviews here. I was not disappointed. We love this collection!
B00005JKJA|5.0|this movie is terrific, is a kind of trip and play in the mind, the sound take us to a magic and strange place with a lot of  fellings. Evreybody that likes mind tricks needs to see, to watch and listen this movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|An excellent series - if you enjoy sci fi you will like this one.

B000E97Y6A|3.0|Jack Black (School of Rock, High Fidelity) stars as Carl Denham, a director who has found a map to a place called Skull Island. He assembles his crew, he hires a captain and his ship and he hires a beautful Ann Darrow, played by the beautiful Nicole Kidman look alike Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr., The Ring) and they go on a voyage to find this mysterious Skull Island. They arrive there not knowing what's going to happen but then they meet the natives....scary looking natives who kill some of them but they flee. The natives eventually come back and kidnap Naomi Watts, bring her back to their place and strap her down so that she can be sacrificed to KONG, who is a massive Ape. Black, his crew and Adrien Brody (The Pianist, The Jacket), who plays Jack Driscoll, go off with the captain and his men to go rescue Watts from her awaited doom but she is taking into the jungle by the Ape and suddenly Kong becomes lost in her beauty. The hunt continues as the rest of the gang faces great perils, dinosaurs, lizards, nasty looking bugs to try to resue Watts. Jack Black wants to capture the Ape and they do by cholorforming it. They bring Kong back to Manhattan where Kong becomes King Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World but Kong then escapes causing more havoc, breaking out in the streets, climbing building...he even throws blonde woman away as he tries to find his. Then we all know what happens, King Kong climbs the empire state building with the blonde girl, airplanes come and so forth. Peter Jackson triumphs making it a welcome tribute the to the original one (which is still good by the way), with an excellent cast despite some cheesy effects...an example being the longneck dinosaurs pursuing the resue party. This blows away the Jeff Bridges one too (which was god awful and even more god awful when they put a crown on King Kong's head in that one). It's long...yes, but that creates story and we get to know the characters more better....enjoy it and if you cant, well then you're just a crab apple. Also starring Colin Hanks (Orange County), Kyle Chandler (Tv's Early Edition), Jamie Bell (Undertow, Billy Elliott) Thomas Kretschmann (Blade 2, The Pianist), Evan Parke (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, All My Children) and Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, 24 Hour Party People) who plays both King Kong and Lumpy. <br />
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|Very nice movie.  Romantic.  The music in the movie was great so I reccommend the sound track as well.  Seeing Richard Gere and J.Lo together was both romantic and hot!  Seeing Richard Gere in a tux with a rose was beyond hot!  A must see for lovers of Richard Gere, J. Lo., ballroom dancing and great music.
B000DZIGE4|3.0|Jaky Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Highway) stars as Anthony Swoffard who is in the deserts of Saudi Arabia where he is being trained by Sgt. Sykes played by Jamie Foxx (Ray, Collateral), to get ready for the on coming war. Swofford becomes a sniper and his spotter is Troy, played by Peter Sarsgaard (Skeleton Key, Shattered Glass). Darkly funny and some scenes with power make JarHead interesting and the direction is amazing, be it explosions or soldiers walking along burnt cars or oil fields at night on fire with is scary and beautiful at the same time. Also starring Chris Cooper (Capote, October Sky), Jacob Vargas (Nexy Friday, Traffic), Lucas Black (Crazy In Alabama, Sling Blade) and Dennis Haysbert (Tv's 24, Absolute Power) They got refrences from The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Giant with James Dean. Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performances so far, Sarsgaard is explosive and Jamie Foxx digs out of the BOMB pit that was the movie Stealth. \\"Welcome to the Suck!\\"
B00005NG9Z|5.0|I know two things about \\"grunge\\". No one really knows what that is and true Seattle music fans hate that term. It was just another label used by the greedy music corporations who wanted to cash in on an exploding Seattle music scene. My aversion to that label and what I perceived as grunge music back then, led me and a lot of other people to ignore some really great music that came out of that city in the 90s. Alice in Chains was definitely one of the best, as this DVD shows, and there is nothing \\"grungy\\" about them.
B000BM6AVA|2.0|listen, this CD is good, music wise, but it isn't quite the classic old SOAD, that we all know is better, they have all gotten soft, no more screaming or roaring and having heavy headbanging angry riffs, no, just some form of odd, duett, slow, less metal, of wich they first came out as, the only thing that even resembles the old stuff is ATTACK, all the other songs are turn-off's for the headbanging type people, like me, good music (sometimes), but it's one of those CD's you want to get burned from your friend rather then buy, that was my mistake.
B00006LI4S|5.0|Quick summary: <br /> <br />Audio quality: (10/10) I own 20 concerts, this is number one in audio quality. Gilmour sounds better now than he ever did. Not kidding. <br /> <br />Video Quality: (8/10) Crystal clear; 16x9 native; not HD I believe. Example: Rush \\"R30\\" was shot in HD, give that a 10/10 for video quality. Gilmour's is excellent though. <br /> <br />I have been a huge Pink Floyd fan since the 70's. The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, Final Cut, Animals, Wish You Were Here, etc. are GREAT albums. I got into Momentary Lapse of reason a little and didn't listen to Division Bell. <br /> <br />This concert is not like traditional Floyd shows but much more intimate. David Gilmore is upfront singing and playing guitar. He has 9 back up singers (awesome!) another guitarist, bass, drums, piano, and cello. This concert doesn't \\"rock\\" in a classic rock sense- it is kind of like a Gilmore \\"unplugged\\" and it is in a more intimate setting. <br /> <br />The first time I watched it I was kind of disappointed.  \\"Not like Floyd!\\" Then I liked it more and more each time. Now I can't get enough of it.  Beautiful melodies and harmonies. A full, rich, beautifully mixed sound. Every instrument is crystal clear.  Highly recommended if you have the patience to get to know it. (Aren't all great albums like that? If you love it at first you get sick of it, if you are unsure at first and grow to love it, then it stays with you forever...) <br /> <br />
B000001FDK|4.0|I love having the \\"Grease\\" CD in my car.  I can imagine how silly I must look driving down the streets of Houston smilin' & just singin' along.
0440418569|4.0|The third and final chapter of this series was brilliant.  It all comes together, the worlds, the people in them, realise they need to work together, be one group of worlds to save each other.  The love between Will and Lyra finally blossoms after lots of hinting by Pullman.  The book delves into the Church, god, and the meanings of them.  I don't think Pullman hates religion, god, etc., but I think he is trying to show that sometimes zealotry can lead to problems.  This further hurts people and causes them to do things that they will regret.  I think he had an interesting view of all this and it was nice to see it have a happy yet sad feeling that gets you right in the pit of your stomach sort of like your daemon coming back to you.
B00005JNQS|5.0|I bought this movie for my 6-year-old son after seeing part of it at a friend's house. Each time he watches it, he laughs with sheer delight at all his favorite scenes, and later references them while talking to me about other things that make him think of them. If nothing else, to me, that's the sign of a good movie - memorable scenes and quotes that you find yourself repeating later. <br /> <br />While others have said that the story line is less than stellar, I find the visual eye-candy appeal and creative engineering of the parts-people and parts-places more than makes up for it. All in all, this is fun entertainment that a family can enjoy together.
B00005MP58|5.0|The film of this beautiful novel is absolutely true to the book!!!  I've seen other versions of this book, including the latest one (which was pretty good, I got a kick out of the more realistic rendering of the manor where the Bennet family lived, including a large pig wandering through the place, and Donald Sutherland was great as the father and Dame Judi Dence as Mrs. Bennet. The older version was also quite good with Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivia]. However, the special edition was the BEST ever. Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy. Jennifer Ehle did a good job as Elizabeth Bennet, but in my opinion, not quite as good as Greer Garson, years ago.  I have this book, and have read it at least 3 times. My first love in reading, are the Victorian novels, and as many times as I've read them, I feel I am qualified to judge the films which are made from them.
B000054OXU|3.0|Of all the 60s legends who took baffling artistic detours through the decade Kris Kristofferson described as \\"shipwrecked\\"--Dylan and the Stones come especially to mind--Neil Young's was by far the most fascinating. After responding to the epic success of the \\"Rust\\" albums with characteristically unpredictable forays into inaccessible pseudo-punk (Reactor) and rickety folk meanderings (Hawks & Doves), Neil Young journeyed to places few of his fans were willing to go: the electronica dance beats of \\"Trans\\" which, we later learned, featured electronically distorted vocals that emerged from attempts at communicating through a computer with his son Ben, a quadriplegic suffering from cerebral palsy.<br /><br />In retrospect, the 80s are as legendary a period in Neil Young's career as his 70s heyday--not because the music was great, but precisely because it wasn't, culminating in the now-infamous lawsuit filed against Young by David Geffen for making music that didn't sound Neil young enough. Many like to call \\"Landing on Water\\" Neil's worst album, but that distinction--if we really must make it--belongs to the morbidly produced \\"Everybody's Rockin'\\". While Springsteen and Joel seemed to discover new voices with 50s nostalgia pieces like \\"Pink Cadillac\\" and \\"Uptown Girl\\" around the same time, Neil's flirtation with similar curiosities reflected, if anything, a voice that had become all but irretrievable.<br /><br />It could hardly have been a surprise, then, that \\"Landing on Water\\" further exemplified the erratic artistic indulgences Young was favoring at the time, with its characteristically grungy licks and riffs laid over a jarring and misguided cacophony of synthesized drums and rhythms. It isn't just that the album sounds dated in 2006; the production is so insular that it was destined to sound dated before the year of its release came to a close. And yet, despite all this, \\"Landing on Water\\" contains three essential performances that die-hard and open-minded fans will learn to appreciate. \\"Hippie Dream\\"--with its moving eulogy for the bygone days of flower power--is a biting appraisal of an era he helped define, while \\"Drifter\\" and \\"Touch the Night\\" showcase a Neil Young who almost finds his groove amid the album's synth-laden idiosyncrasies.<br /><br />These songs are treasures of an artistic vision stretching to fathom the boundaries of its expression, and the ambition of the material it produced at that time is, to my ears, every bit as beautiful as Young's best work. It may not always have sounded great--indeed, it usually strained just to sound listenable. But Neil's refusal to look away from less familiar artistic cravings is exactly the kind of edginess his reputation is founded on, and it is the good fan who understands glories like \\"Sleeps With Angels\\", \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Ragged Glory\\" could not have been possible without the misadventures that preceded them.<br /><br />Visit my blog at [...]reciate. \\"Hippie Dream\\"--with its moving eulogy for the bygone days of flower power--is a biting appraisal of an era he helped define, while \\"Drifter\\" and \\"Touch the Night\\" showcase a Neil Young who almost finds his groove amid the album's synth-laden idiosyncrasies.

B000BEZQ18|5.0|It's undeniable the power the film 'Brokeback Mountain' carries.  I didn't realize until listening to this sountrack straight through the power that can come from a few strokes of guitar strings.  Gustavo Santaolalla beautifully pieces together a score that will rush you with memories of this spectacular film, from the opening track, of course the notable 'Brokeback Mountain 1,2 & 3' and the closing 'Wings' which is used in every trailer, but it was the track 'Riding Horses' that had me in tears.  It's subtlety is it's forcefulness and will break you down with thoughts of this ill-fated love affair.  'A Love that will Never Grow Old' is a beautiful song that won the golden globe for a reason.  Emmylou Harris has a beautiful voice, although I could picture Alison Krouse really knocking this out of the park.  My favorite track here, besides the haunting 'Riding Horses', is 'I Don't Want to Say Goodbye' by Teddy Thompson.  The album contains classic country ballads like Willie Nelson's 'He was a Friend of Mine' and 'No ONe's Gonna Love you like Me' by Mary McBride and then theres classic bar romping tunes like 'The Devil's Right Hand' and 'An Angel went up in Flames' but the beauty of this album is that through all the diversity it keeps in tune with the film and the feel of the story in general.  A beautiful and perfect companion to the best film of the year.
6305907145|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  If you like any Jane Austin movie like Emma, or Pride and Prejudice, you will Love this one!
B000002H70|5.0|Disintegration has to be my most favorite album that has ever been recorded in the entire history of forever. All the way from 'Plainsong' to 'Untitled', this entire album is the definition of perfection, with highlights that include 'Same Deep Water As You' and 'Disintegration'. Robert Smith is an absolute genius. This is my first favorite Cure album, Pornography following shortly after. Pornography is completely filled with sorrow and pain. The feelings of suffocation in pure agony. However, Disintegration gave me feelings of both depression and hope. 'Same Water as Deep as You' can accompany a suicide and be very fitting for the occasion; whereas 'Fascination Street' seemed to be a little more optimistic. The whole cd is an epic masterpiece. Must have for anyone that even begins to claim to like music.
B000001ZS3|4.0|It was nice to hear this album again, years after its original LP release.  It still holds up well.

B000BHHVPO|5.0|This is a very professional DVD both sound and visual. Every classic and popular band is featured at their \\"LIVE\\" best. Pink Floyd playing together is worth the price of this set alone. Don't miss the rehearsal footage of Floyd in the bonus track area of the DVD. I would give this SIX stars but FIVE is the max allowed for a review.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|As a big fan of the Firefly series, I was excited when the Serenity movie came out.  It certainly did not disappoint me.  The movie has great characters, wonderful special effects and neatly wraps up the Firefly story line.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Initially, I was going to give the premiere film only 4 stars. Then I saw the Director's Edition; enhanced effects, musical score and additional CGI effects elevate it to 5 stars! Thank God Paramount Pictures allowed director Robert Wise (in one of his final tasks before his death) to team with several effects artists to \\"re-design\\" this film as it was meant to be shown. Great care was taken to blend new-millenia technology with 70's special effects; the new effects complement the old ones without looking out of place. Examples: <br />1. A re-imagined opening, with a star-field matching the beautiful musical score, along with new opening credits (the old ones were so bland & static!).  <br />2. Original shot: On the planet Vulcan, Spock shields his eyes from the sky; a long shot reveals it is nothing but blackness & stars! Huh?? New shot: Long shot becomes a yellow-orange sky, complete with mountains and giant statues (now this makes sense!).  <br />3. New CGI-created shots of future San Francisco & Starleet Headquarters. They're far more panoramic and impressive than the original shots.  <br />4. The wormhole scene: the torpedoing of the object is enhanced, making the explosion more spectacular.  <br />5. Enhanced effects during the climactic \\"meeting of V'ger\\".  <br /> <br />Aside from the effects, this is a film which received mixed reactions from fans upon its original release, but improves with age. There's sparse humor here, which is restrained, unlike the following films. The tone and pacing of ST:TMP is very different from what was displayed in future \\"Treks\\"; Wise seemed to be going for an \\"epic ballet in space\\", much like \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" (witness the long, long lingering shots of the Enterprise while Admiral Kirk eyes her lovingly from a shuttle). The effects quite often smother the familiar trappings of Star Trek; however, the cast still manages to have their moments. In fact, Kirk, Spock and McCoy each have grand entrances (or is that re-entrance?) aboard their beloved ship.  <br />I didn't care too much for the uniforms and set design; it all had the white & sterile look of a hospital corridor (I prefer the darker, more \\"romanticized\\" military uniforms in the latter films).  <br />But as Spock had declared in a later film: \\"There is a beginning for everything\\". So true. The Trek films had to start somewhere, and just re-fine the elements from there. Not a bad start--and the Director's Edition makes the experience only better!
B000002I6T|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time. In a sense, it's like a great Van Morrison album--\\"Listen to the Lion\\" tinged with Southern California soul, if that makes sense. Backed by members of the Jefferson Airplane, the Dead and other friends (Nash, Young), Crosby delivers one haunting, powerful song after another: \\"Music Is Love,\\" \\"Cowboy Movie,\\" \\"What Are Their Names,\\" \\"Tampais High,\\" etc., etc. If you don't own it, you should.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Its to bad that Rage against the machine just couldnt see eye to eye as band members. It even more disspointing that this would be their final album of orignal material, and it would be thier best. Even though the first two releases were Great Albums, this one is unreal. If you want to hear some increable Guitar Work from Tom, this is the Album to pick up. Not only does the band sound so Complete here, it is also the Heaviest album that Rage would do. I cant reccomend this album enough to fans of Metal and Hard Rock. Even though some have classified it as Nu Metal, I believe it to be mroe of a mix of Hard Rock and Hip-Hop which some bands over do (Limp Bizkets) and some pull off nicely (Linkin Park) yet Rage pulls it off the best, because Zack is a great vocalist, and Tom and Company are very good musicans. I think Tom might be one of the most under-rated Guitarist of the Modern Era, and Trust me that Guitar Players will love the effects that Tom gets here from Running his Guitar though a wah-wah, and God knows what other kind of trickery he has up his sleeve. ENJOY
0684857219|5.0|This book is awesome. Even if you're not trying to be a competition body builder, the info in this book can help you to become healthy and strong, and build tremendous muscle mass. The book begins with a history of body building. Then Arnold writes about the basic principles of weightlifting/body building. Arnold tells you how to build mass and shape, and the differences between weight lifters and body builders. The middle section, and biggest part of the book, shows TONS of different exercises for each body part and each muscle group. There are detailed photos of each exercise as well as an explanation of the proper technique and what muscles the exercises are for. Then it ends with chapters on nutrition and mind power. I read an earlier version of this book also, but this new version (which was updated by Arnold in 1998) contains lots of new info that wasn't available when the book was first written. I would reccomend this book to ANYONE interested in becoming healthy! Even my mom.
B000062YB1|3.0|I love Slayer, and almost every album they have done is worthy of 5 stars, yet Seasons in the Abyss never quite did it for me. I was never a huge fan of this album, and even though it took awhile for \\"South of Heaven\\" to grow on me (which is my favorite Slayer Release) this one never quite did, and I have had it in my collection since the day it was released. There are some really great Kick ass songs on here and Dead Skin Mask and the Title track are probely the 2 best songs on here, yet some songs just dont sit well with me such as \\"Skeltons of Society\\",  \\"Hallowed Point\\", and \\"Born of Fire\\" are some weak Slayer songs. Skeletons is probely the worst song Slayer has written, and Hallowed Point isnt much better. YET, its still an OK album, and I am only really basing it on the fact that Slayer has done Soooo much better on other albums, and hey if Slayer hasnt written so much great music, then the album would have probely gotten more stars...But still add this in your collection, cause Dead Skin Mask and Title track alone are worth price of admission.!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw the movie before I saw the series and that was awesome, but thats for a different review.  I have to say that I was blown away by how good this series was and the fact that Fox canceled it!  This is a network putting on shows about families switching wives, what kind of crap is this?  The death of TV as we know it? <br /> <br />Well, I am sad to say that there are only about 13 episodes of this show.  I have grown attached to each of the characters due to how believeable they make everything.  This show is a combination of space, pirates, and the wild west.  Because the crew does pirate type things in space and they're outlaws like in the west and the whole show has that wild west feel to it.  For example the Captain has what looks like a six shooter on him at all times and is quick on the draw too. <br /> <br />This show is the best Sci-Fi show I have ever seen.  I think they have an interesting take on it and its a new spin on the idea of flying through space.  The ships in Star Trek has every luxury one could hope to have in their home while the ship in Firefly is having a hard time getting them to their next stop.  No sonic showers and endless supplies of food.  On this show an apple is a luxury. <br /> <br />At the risk of sounding like a broken record... PLEASE SOMEONE BRING BACK THIS SHOW!  Or if not this show then a new show with the same story and characters that picks up after the movie.  This show is so original for a sci-fi show.  Don't let it just die!

B000E1YVZU|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about this film when I first heard the news that the musical was to be adapted to the silver screen. But I was a pleasantly surprised Renthead when I went and saw the film. Sure, it left out a lot of the songs that were originally in the musical. But personally I think Chris Columbus did the right thing to cut them. If he hadn't, it would have obstructed the general flow of the movie.  <br /> <br />\\"No day but today.\\" That is a wonderful way to live life. In the moment, day by day. Jonathon Larson conveys a powerful message in those words. It truly is a tragedy that he was unable to see what an impact his musical would have on the world. <br /> <br />Whether you're a first timer, or a die hard Renthead as I am, buy this as soon as you can. Don't rent it :) (forgive the pun) <br /> <br />\\"There is no future, there is no past.\\"
B00005JLRT|1.0|I can't decide what's worse, this horrific movie or the \\"fans\\" who gave it 5 stars!  <br /> <br />I remember walking out of the theater in 2002 in shock and very angry at what had become of my beloved ST:TNG. I had suffered through some pretty bad  <br />Star Trek movies in my time but this was the absolute lowest Rick Berman could take the franchise. The plot was just plain ludicrous. <br />Hackneyed dune buggy chases. A retarded Data clone that they just happened to find. A vengeful Romulan Picard clone (?) willing to start an intergalactic war and destroy Earth to get a blood transfusion. And the icing on the cake was the killing off of Data. This angered me. It was supposed to be a noble act of self-sacrifice but it came across as superfluous and stupid. I couldn't even watch TNG reruns after that. I wish this movie had never been made.
B000002KD9|5.0|Yeah, Neil's made quite a few good records: I'd point one to Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, Tonight's the Night, On the Beach, Rust Never Sleeps, Freedom, Ragged Glory, Harvest Moon and Living with War. But this is his best. Not only that, it's the place to start. Why? It's the epitome of his classic sound. Much like what Neil himeslf did during his first decade as a solo artists, Gold Rush ranges from raging barroom rock (the classic Southern Man; When You Dance) and mellow, tuneful folk or country-folk (Tell Me Why; title track; Only Love Can Break Your Heart; Don't Let It Bring You Down; Birds). And it's simply the best collection of songs in Neil's entire discography. The worst of the bunch (I Believe in You) would've led the way on the '80's albums: the best (Tell Me Why; title track; Southern Man; Only Love Can Break Your Heart; Don't Let It Bring You Down; When You Dance I Can Really Love) proves why After the Gold Rush is perfectly capable of blowing a lesser album off the map. Hell, I even like his version of Oh, Lonesome Me, which has been ripped open since its release. But it beats anything from, say, This Note's for You (or even Comes a Time, for that matter). There are also quite a few solid piano-based tunes here (title track; Till the Morning Comes; Birds; Cripple Creek Ferry). Seeing I'm so in love with the piano (in fact, I'm a pianist myself), this is heaven for me. Actually, the whole album is.
0684824906|4.0|Very interesting book. Gives a lot of insight into the era leading up to Lincoln's preidency and the presidency itself. Though I found the book very enlightening, the one drawback I had was what seemed to me an over abundance of details in each of the men's lives. I know the author wanted to let the readers almost know these men personally from the writings but at times the story seemed to drag and I found myself wanting to skip forward to get on with the story. Still I think it was very worthwhile reading especially to history buffs.
B000000H4V|5.0|If your a sepultura fan then you already have heard or heard of this album before at least I hope. On Choas AD Sepultura have changed their sound up a little bit. But still keep it thrashy their sound has however slowed down and taken a heavier route. Its a sweet album letting Culture and Music Collide. Its a tightened up package and it kicks ass. An absoultue must in any Sepulnutt's collection. PS if your a sepulfan check out Sepularmy.net. And be sure to pick up DanteXXI in stores soon. Great album and set the stage for Roots Sep's finest album and a top 10 of 90's metal.

0060899190|5.0|I read this book in one sitting.  Like a voyeur, I could not get enough of other people's secrets.  And I wanted to know more.  I wanted to know who and why or how things turned out.  But all I got was the secret.  I laughed at some.  I felt truly bad for others.  And I thought about the book long after I finished reading/looking at it.  Now it is my goal to encourage as many people to read this book as I possibly can.
0425166805|4.0|It was an entertaining book to read.  As suggested by many other reviewers, the author is not presenting his ideas as a theory, but as a hypothesis, and so people should not get all upset about it.  I think this hypothesis should have been examined by scientists in a more systematic way.      It is perfectly fine if you don't like his explanation of the archaelogical mysteries, but then you should be prompted to figure out alternative explanations based on more sound logic, instead of closing your eyes to hard facts, as most archaelogists have.  That point is raised by the author himself many times in the book.
0393035158|4.0|Harris says things that aren't new, and should be obvious, if only irrational religious thought wasn't given a free pass by far too many people in society. Harris fires the bulk of his ammunition at Islam, and that's fair; it is radical Islam, after all, far more than any other organized faith today, that presents a real threat to freedom around the world. If that strikes some as bigoted and prejudicial, ask yourself the last time you saw radical Christians, Jews, Hindus etc. beating, burning and killing over cartoons. It's almost as if Harris' book foresaw such savage silliness erupting in the Middle East. His chapter detailing just how many times the Qu'ran implores the faithful to kill the \\"infidel\\" should be an eye opener for anyone who reads it. <br /> <br />But Harris certainly offers up real criticism of the other major world religion's as well. He's dead on in stating that it's secular forces from the Enlightenment and after that has brought about much of the decency, fairness, equality, and freedom that does exist in the world today. And he points out that the seeds of a more savage Christianity are still present everywhere in the world today. When you have a sitting member of the Supreme Court derisively dismissing those that \\"value life\\" more than the true believers in eternal life after death, it should worry you how this contagion of thought might effect the behavior of otherwise intelligent people. Think of members of any faith or denomination that truly and sincerely believes that anyone who doesn't follow their way not only will be tortured for all eternity, but deserves it, and then consider what's been going on in secret prisons around the world, and how our President frequently expresses his fundamentalist beliefs, and make the connection for yourself. <br /> <br />Harris weakens his case a bit by delving into his own brands of mysticism. Most of it is harmless, and I would agree that there is much wisdom in Eastern philosophy, but there's much wisdom in Western philosophy also. Harris' cheerleading routine for Asian mysticism rings a bit false considering the tone of the rest of the book.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|This is a must for anyone. i would say something to Strummer fans, but those who are would already have this. for those who are not, this album is a reflection of the sounds strummer was a fan of - jamaican roots, rockabilly, brit punk, etc. get it, just get it, if you don't don't like it, listen to it a few more times. joe, johnny wasn't the only one who cast a long shadow.
020530902X|5.0|Elements of Style teaches you the best methods for writing, whether it be script writing or a novel. this the book I would highly recommend.
0307276902|5.0|Alright, so all the drama about this book was completely overrated. This is one of the best books I have read in years. I don't care that some parts of the book are fiction the main point is that it keeps you on your toes the whole time. I couldn't put it down because I wanted to find out what happened next. When James describes detox, it was so real, I just had to put the book down because it was making me sick. If a book that you are reading can have a physiological effect on you, then you know it's a GREAT book. I felt like I was right there next James going through what he was going through. The style that the book is written in is amazing as well. I love the fact that there is no quotes, just verse. James Frey...this book is AMAZING. I recommend this to anyone who has the strenght to go through this program with James. This is as real as the sun and the sky. *****

0596007124|5.0|I wasn't going to buy this book because of the cover (what a reason, he he), but after reading the reviews I decide to give it a try before buying the GoF book.<br /><br />I have found this book useful in the patterns that I really didn't understand, but for a lot of parts I just decided to skip pages since the book is sometimes too verbose and have a lot of graphics and diagrams.<br /><br />I wasn't very familiar with Design Patterns in the formal way before this book, but as I was reading it I realized how many times I applied these concepts in my work without knowing that they were patterns.<br /><br />After reading it I feel much more confident about object oriented design.<br /><br />Excelent for beginners, maybe too verbose for seasoned developers, but it's still fun and useful!.<br /><br />I will keep reading One First Series in order to learn other topics I'm unfamiliar with.

B00004WLXZ|5.0|This film is the only one of its kind. A true historical achieve with the ability to communicate its message in the 21st century. The cinematic virtues of this film are obvious and have been well described by those with much more expertise on film history than myself. I wish to comment on the emotion and spirit of the film. This film is old by modern media standards,1930's Germany, but its motifes and content are almost mid-evil.The intensity and devotion of the National Socialists to their leader and their cause and the values they hold dear, blood ,nation ,soil are almost gone from the earth ,especially in the west.In fact it could be argued that was perhaps one of the goals of the allies in WWII to wipe away this ancient and powerfully seductive vision of human life. It certainly runs head long against so called representative democracy,and the utopian philosophies of Soviet communism. Both of these philosophies are idealistic and wedded to modern and post modern thought.The Nazis seem to come from another realm in comparison with their torches and banners ,eagles and svastikas.It is like watching a documentary on Atilla the Hun or Genghis Kan or Alexander the Great,where the followers place god-like faith in there leader and over everything hangs the air of mistery, exitement and dread. The most mindboggeling thing that one has to remind oneself while watching this film is that what they are watching is something real and not a Hollywood creation. One last time in the history of the world a god-man walked the earth and all the world will forever know his name, Adolph Hitler.

B000294SFW|5.0|Like most fans of Motorhead I felt that Ace of Spades was their culminating effort.  There have been some excellent subsequent albums, but Ace of Spades was the one with the greatest armour-piercing impact.  But last week, when I was watching  Motorhead's awesome new live-show DVD \\"Stagefright,\\" I heard a few astonishing songs which I did not recall having ever heard before.  I learned they were from the new album, \\"Inferno.\\"  I immediately bought it. <br /> <br />This album cooks. There's not a weak song.  Lemmy and the boys jam like men half their age.  I personally think \\"In the Name of Tragedy\\" is one of the best hard rock riffs I've ever heard in my life; it's up there with TNT or Dirty Deeds (AC/DC) or Shattered (Stones) or Space Truckin'/Highway Star (Deep Purple) in terms of infectious appeal.  I can just listen to that song over and over and over.  \\"In the Year of the Wolf\\" has intense and somber character, a very unique, foreboding quality which I have never heard in a rock song before.  It sounds in tone like an old Viking telling a story of a lifetime of warfare...or some similar recounting of spectacular and apocalyptic events.  Even the ACOUSTIC \\"Whorehouse Blues\\" has a really catchy riff to it and really grows on you. <br /> <br />What is so cool (especially to those of us over 40) is that this is conclusive proof that there is indeed life ahead.  Mr. Lemmy Kilmeister is now 60!!  What an amazing character he is.  I think it adds tremendous sparkle to an already legendary career that this \\"Lion in Winter\\" is still kicking out riffs of this quality and magnitude.  This album is so good and so classic it will take several years for it to be fully assimilated by the old fans and new fans of Motorhead. It is clearly a top one-percenter. Wait for the neighbors to leave and turn it up loud!
0446677450|5.0|If you are not educating your family now then they shall be doomed to a life a mediocrity stuck in the middle class 'rat race' with no up, no down and no beginning or no end. <br /> <br />This book, the principals within and the basics of having a succesful life full of treasure (family, time with family, education, empowerment)are all 'secrets' within. <br /> <br />I hope others read this book and get it as I did. <br />
B000E1YVZU|2.0|The movie started off well with the staging of Seasons of Love, but then went downhill.  Situations that you accepted on stage and characters you loved did not work in a more realistic setting.  The age of the actors made a difference too.  I left the movie theater thinking: \\"Wow, these are selfish people!\\"  They kill dogs, whine about getting jobs and paying rent, and are drug addicts.  In the play you are transported to their world and love and accept them, but I truly disliked them in the movie.  However, the songs sounded great and I enjoy the cd a lot!
0689865384|4.0|The Uglies drew me into a world where everyone can look \\"perfect\\" and where technology seems to have solved most of our modern problems.  Westerfeld creates beleivable characters and makes the fantastic advances beleivable.  I read this along with some of my sixth graders, who chose it as a lit group book, and we all had fun.  Several of the students went on the the sequel, \\"The Pretties\\".  I recommend this book to fans of \\"Among the Hidden\\", \\"The Giver\\", or \\"Truesight\\".  It follows the distopian tradition of showing an individual's fight against a society's warped values.

B00000DCHI|5.0|I LOVE BILLY JOEL!!!! HE ROCKS!!!! IF I COULD GIVE THIS ALBUM A MILLION STARS I WOULD!!!! I LOVE THAT SONG UPTOWN GIRL! Oh, that Uptown Girl! And her crazy whitebread world! You rule, Uptown Girl! I also love Scenes from an Italian Restaurant! I especially love listening to it on the way to the multiplex after having eaten at Olive Garden!!! I love Olive Garden! I love multiplexes, too, especially the ones that play all the commercials before Harry Potter comes on! I love Harry Potter! I love commercials!!!! You know what? One time, \\"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\\" was playing when I WAS IN AN OLIVE GARDEN!!! Isn't that crazy! Cuz Olive Garden is a genuine Italian restaurant! My girlfriend thought it was crazy, too! We don't date anymore! She dumped me for some other guy!!! And so I burned all my Bill Joel albums!!!! But! I'm dating now and am buying my Billy Joel albums all over again. I'm starting with this one! I can't wait to hear Piano Man! And I can't wait for Steppin Out to come to my local theater. That day will be the greatest day of my life!!!! You're the tops, BJ! :) :)

I said, wait, \\"I don't like songs about parties and retarded sexuality.\\" YOU MUST LIKE THE BEASTIE BOYS!!!!! Two jackbooted thugs from Rolling Stone put me in cuffs and dragged me to their offices and put me in a cell where I was forced to listen to this album and all the Beasties records for two weeks straight. I said: \\"This is torture.\\" They said: YOU MUST LIKE THIS ALBUM AND PAUL'S BOUTIQUE even more. After the 1,000th listen, while being forced to guzzle Natty Light beer and read the works of the Buddha, I submitted. Now, I walk in a daze singing \\"Brass Monkey.\\" I like the Beasties now, I really do. And I want to make sure the music police know that.
0440238609|4.0|...but not what I was expecting. <br /> <br />The first two books were extraordinary. Great Maybe. I didn't see how he was going to wrap it up in one more book. <br /> <br />Neither did he I guess. The Amber Spyglass was a mess. Hairbombs? Eve's temptation turning out to be an adolescent crush? (My mom and dad don't get it, but that Will is pretty kewl after all.) And maybe Mrs. Coulter wasn't really so bad. He didn't know WHERE to take it. <br /> <br />I'm really disappointed.

0307276902|5.0|Well! When I first ordered this book it was a recommendation by a friend and when I finally got the book that's when the whole controversy about the author lying about certain situations happened. It made me want to read the book even more and compare the book to the interview the author had with Opra. All in all I enjoyed reading \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" I thought the book was great. I have recommended this book too many of my friends. I also look forward to reading the second James Frey book!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never saw Firefly when it was on TV.  I saw the movie Serenity and it was one of the most entertaining & satisfying movies I saw last year.  I decided to get Firefly on DVD and have not been dissapointed one bit.  It's just as funny, gritty, interesting, and \\"pulls-no-punches\\" as the movie was.  If you liked the movie, you'll like this too.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a series that joins science fiction (without the aliens) to an older tradition of the western, Robin Hood, and all of the wonderful pirate movies. It is about the powerless taking on the powerful. It is about making moral decisions, sometimes incorrectly. It recognizes evil in the world and the costs of defeating that evil. Should be seen before watching the feature length film, Serenity.
B00003CXUM|4.0|Kar Wai Wong's lyrical 2002 nostalgia piece is almost tailor-made for this beautiful Criterion Collection edition because of its complex historical and cultural allusions, which are perhaps not readily understood by many Western viewers, that its very simple narrative structure belies. In 1962 Hong Kong, the Chans, a couple from Shanghai, move into an apartment with other Shaghai emigrés where they live down the hall from Chow Mo Wan, a newspaper editor, and his wife. The film is told almost entirely from the perspective of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Chan (Maggie Leung), who slowly come to realize (as the viewer does) that their spouses are having an affair. The two main characters come together first to commiserate, but they slowly come to fall in love with one another... yet their refusal to be \\"like\\" their faithless spouses prohibits them from committing to one another fully. The film is constructed like a puzzle, with many scenes scene from just around a corner, or down a hall, or through a nook or alcove. The deliberately slow pacing (underlined by the score's use of a beautiful but maddeningly repetitive waltz theme on the cello) can be a bit soporific, and you can find yourself after a while fixating on the showstopping series of spectacular cheongsam Maggie Cheung wears. (\\"She can't possibly top this one,\\" you'll think after each scene, and then she will.)     But like Resnais's LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD (which this film seems at times to evoke quite consciously) or Akerman's JEANNE DIEHLMAN, part of the point of IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE is to change your perception of temporal understanding, and to stay with this film and accept its tempo is to enter its world where the passage of time changes because of the story it depicts. The film's ending has been controversial because of its abruptness and dissimilarity, but this too is part of Kar Wei Wong's point, and the alternate endings this Criterion edition appends greatly helps a confused viewer understand what's going on. So too do the fine essays by Chinese film scholars which helps clarify the rich historical framework of Hong Kong and Shanghai in the mid 20th century, and also the melodramas of the 30s Shanghai cinema to which Kar Wei Wong pays homage.
B000002OX5|4.0|I was very pleasantly suprised by this album. I wasn't familiar with most of the songs but there are a lot of gems, kind a rough pe-cursor to Tommy. I don't like \\"Armenia\\" but all the others are great. I also kind of prefer the post-Tommy who where they really show off more of their musicianship rather than just songwriting skills. For instance, I don't feel like John Entwhistle's bass really shines thru on this album or Townsend's guitar; but it still rocks and I highly recommend it for Who fans
0307276902|5.0|Embellishment makes this a work of fiction, but it appears to be based on facts. I found it very well written. <br />It may scare those whose careers are based on \\"negative programming\\" like \\"(1.) I am powerless over .......\\" repeated like an affermation of faith to drill it into your subconcience. <br />This book provides understanding and help. I'm glad that I didn't let the negative press stop me from reading it. <br />
B0009R1T7M|4.0|This album is a real treat, especially for those of us who are fans of the symphonic/rock of Brian Wilson (The Beach Boys). While this album doesn't have the \\"lazy day surf\\" feel of Brian Wilson it has the wonderful layers of voices and instruments you might find on the Beach Boys 'Pet Sounds' album. Even the lyrics bear a similar boyhood innocents. By innocent I don't mean naivety. This album is a real treat. You'll find it difficult to keep yourself from singing along.
0977326403|3.0|Interesting presentation but leaves much out of the monograph, e.g., the difference in culture in not-profits that must raise money as contrary to its social mission. Minimum how tos.

B00004WLXZ|5.0|I would highly recommend this DVD - the 'construct' used in this film in 1933 was used in Star Wars and Lord of the Rings because it works! The producer made Hitler look like he had all the answers. The children all lined up (dressed smartly) then the 'farmers' with their shovels and the the military. I just don't understand how The West thought he would not turn those \\"robots\\" lose on the west! <br />Everyone ought to watch this film - so you will recognize when people are being mindlessly controlled. It happened then it will happen again. <br />Regards <br />Charley
B00005JM02|5.0|Great movie. My 2 year old just loves it! It was delivered on time and in perfect condition.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I dont know how the TV show ever got axed, Joss Whedon has proved himself many times over, the series was fantastic but somehow the TV company pulled the plug. I mean who ever heard of a movie being made out a so-called failed TV series? <br />I am the biggest fan of Joss Whedon, I eagerly await anything the man makes next and hope that it gets it's fair due from the networks. <br />I just want to thank him for giving us an ending to a fantastic show - that is the sign of a true storyteller, I hope that he never stops.
B000000WFZ|5.0|Morricone's scoring of \\"The Mission\\" is truly unforgettable. Gabriel's Oboe is one of the most hauntingly beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard. When I first saw the movie many years ago now, I assumed it was a classical piece and have searched in vain for the composer. Imagine my amazement when I stumbled upon it one evening surfing the net. This CD is now one of the staples in my car.
006097625X|5.0|I have read several books about comics, and most have been good. This one though is the best. It is scholarly, yet entertaining, and covers everything. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in comics, or art, but I wouldn't limit it to those areas of interest. I can't imagine anyone not appreciating this book. <br /> <br />I have also read the sequel to this book, Reinventing Comics, and would not recommend it as highly. It is just OK, since Scott said all he really had to say in Understanding Comics.
B000002GFC|5.0|The history of electric blues would not be complete with mention of Eric Clapton, especially during his stint with Cream, which was in the vanguard of the British blues revival of the 1960's.  Indeed, Cream, which also included drummer Ginger Baker and bassist/pianist/guitarist Jack Bruce, covered 30's blues legend Skip James' \\"I'm So Glad.\\"  The bulk of material on this very best of collection is taken from their two best albums, Disraeli Gears and Wheels of Fire, but there are some songs from Fresh Cream and Goodbye.  And it's Clapton's guitar, sizzling and hard-edged one moment, wailing and bluesy the next, that really gave him and Cream their name.<br /><br />The Stones and Led Zeppelin weren't alone in covering Willie Dixon.  Cream covered \\"Spoonful\\" with a tempo and mood, and harmonica that owes a nod to traditional blues.  Their live version of Robert Johnson's \\"Crossroads\\" was their last Top 40 hit, peaking at #28 in 1969.  And another cover is Albert King's \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" with such pain-striking imagery:  \\"been down since I began to crawl/if it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all.\\"  I felt that way years ago.<br /><br />What two songs are best associated with Cream?  A no-brainer there.  There's \\"Sunshine of Your Love,\\" which hit #5, and the #6 \\"White Room,\\" the former from Disraeli Gears and the latter from Wheels of Fire.  The former scores with that familiar crunchy bluesy electric guitar that makes it a classical rock radio staple.  \\"White Room\\" is one of those image-evoking songs that made Cream what it was, from the \\"White room with black curtains\\" to \\"silver horses run down moonbeams.\\"  This and other image songs were highlights of the psychedelic era.<br /><br />But there are other famous tunes.  There's an invigorating feeling in the lyrics of the fun romp of \\"I Feel Free.\\"  I first heard two artists cover this before hearing this original.  They were Belinda Carlisle's poppified rendition on Heaven on Earth and David Bowie's quasi-techno on Black Tie & White Noise.<br /><br />Cream really gets it right on the scathing satire of \\"Politician\\"  Hearing \\"I support the left, though I'm leaning toward the right/but I'm just not there, when it's coming down to a fight\\" would've been ideal for Clinton when he embraced some of Gingrich's Contract on America platform.

0385513755|5.0|I spent some time hearing that this novel was a bestseller. After some weeks, I watched a TV documentary at National Geographic about this story, the real facts and other issues that the author considered important to elaborate... this is where my curiosity start rising.<br /><br />After comparing different editions, I chose the special illustrated edition since I really liked the demo I saw at Amazon. I found that this is beautifully illustrated indeed!! The pictures really help you get involved into the story, which is pretty well written though. Now I know why this is a great book so I recommend you this edition. I haven't finish the book yet, but so far, it got me at the edge.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I can't imagine a better DVD to simply chill out with. How can you beat great music presented so tastefully by ladies who are also easy on the eyes. The whole concert is an audible and visual feast. This was a very pleasant surprise. Being a casual soloist from time to time in church myself, I was awestruck by how easily the sounds flowed from these girls. They make it look so effortless - but I know its not. The special features are also great. All the performers are interviewed, including David Downs, the arranger and conductor. This kid is young enough to be my youngest son - what an incredible talent and he's been at it for some time. Plus most of them have their own websites so you can discover and enjoy more of their music. We will enjoy this one over and over again.
B00005YUPO|2.0|The product is a great learning tool for infants.  It is also fine entertainment for little ones who cannot keep their eyes off it.  The only problem is that this DVD came in broken.   Since it was purchased as a gift and had to be replace in a timely fashion it became a total loss since returning would have taken too long.
0307276902|1.0|When I purchased the book, it was so that I could gain insight into a person's journey through addiction. I think the book is well written but should be re-classified with all the negative media surrounding the untruths stretched throughout the book. I too, have been able to lead a productive life without the 20 years of crack cocaine addiction feeding my need to 'sham' people out of anything. I would think Mr. Frey is feeling pretty low these days but the truth is what sets us all free. Good read for fiction and spiritual in strength for anyone's individual journey down the sometimes, neverending road toward recovery.

Not in Australian stores until March sometime (I Puchased this from Amazon on Release).<br />This film will leave you on the edge of your seat, great acting. Disregard the gore and/or slasher buffs who bag this film, it's up there with the original Exorcist.
0307276902|5.0|True story or not, this is a page turner and a great book.
1579125549|4.0|I use this book for teaching chess concepts to 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students.  If you're a chess enthusiast like me, you probably already have access to many of these problems, but here I have literally thousands of them in a single volume. Great resource for teaching a great game.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Brokeback Mountain sure is a great movie and  having the music is really nice, it is really relaxing, lush sounding some of it. I really dig track #7 Devil's Right Hand, a real fat little jam one will remember from the movie. Also the instrumentals are powerful and beautiful of course, just like in the movie. It is about time a movie like Brokeback Mountain was released, breaking stereotypes and filling up theatres. Heath Ledger and Jake G. both did an oustanding job, they are great actors.
B00003CXD0|4.0|The premise of Tootsie is as follows.  Middle-aged actor Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is having great difficulty finding employment.  Although he is talented at his craft, he is very difficult to work with - he often criticizes and faults the logic of his directors and co-actors, and has acquired a reputation in the theater business and every other acting venue as someone prickly and unpleasant.  Though Michael gets by with his day job as a waiter, he now needs extra money in order to produce a play written by his roommate, Jeff (Bill Murray).  Out of desperation, he finds himself auditioning for a role in a day time soap opera.  The role, however, is meant to be filled by a woman.  Undeterred, Michael disguises himself as a woman, an actress by the name of Dorothy Michaels, and by sheer will and pluck, lands the lucrative role on the show.  Only his roommate and his long-suffering agent know of the scheme.  Soon Michael finds that what he thought would be a temporary supporting role as a firm, no-nonsense hospital administrator has turned into a sensation, his character inspiring millions of people.  He also falls in love with one of his co-workers, the lovely Julie (Jessica Lange).    Material such as this has the potential to be treated in a lame or stupid way, but 'Tootsie' is a smart film; the screenwriter and director obviously understood the characters, and knew what missteps and pitfalls to avoid.  The humor is wonderful, oftentimes relying on subtle timing and inflections of tone, and the way the characters and story evolve is captivating.  Take the relationship between Julie and Michael.  She knows him as her matronly co-worker, and begins to lean upon him as a friend.  He is growing increasingly attracted to her but, in order to keep up his disguise, cannot act on his impulses; instead, he uses his role as a woman to truly listen to Julie and get to know her as a person.  In his disguise of Dorothy Michaels, Michael Dorsey finds himself responding withgenuine compassion and understanding to another person.    The performances are wonderful.  Dustin Hoffman plays his role with force, energy, conviction and humor.  Jessica Lange brings warmth and thoughtfulness to her character, and Bill Murray is a riot as the deadpan roommate.  The screenplay gives them intelligent things to talk about, and explores not only what it's like to be a struggling actor, but issues of personal identity and gender politics.  Tootsie is a clever, delightful and thoroughly enjoyable film.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|I recomend this album to any girl around the age of 13 who doesn't read much and won't mind the cliche and immature lyrics like, \\"Walk around with my hands up in the air cause I just don't care,\\" and \\"I don't want to fall to pieces, I just want to sit and stare at you.\\" The very grown up,\\"Try to tell me what I shouldn't do, you should know by now I won't listen to you\\" and my personal favorite, \\"I looked away, then I looked back at you.\\" Clearly Avril is a talented story-teller. <br /> <br />Other than the lyrics the music is a canned sort of pop that tried to sound like punk rock and failed.
B0001LJCPC|3.0|Another song that is missing from this soundtrack is \\"Sweet the Sting\\" by Tori Amos.  This is playing in the very end of the movie as Uma is driving down the road in the convertible.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Amazing film, esp the director's cut! Amazing DVD as well! A beautiful visual-sound experience. Awesome score by Michael Andrews!
B000002L42|5.0|If you like Steely Dan and have heard the many songs played on the radio - this album is for you.  Completed as a compilation of live concert recordings, the band enjoys the freedom that live settings allow.   <br /> <br />Heavy Jazz influence and long solo breaks make this album a must have. Track 2 and Track 4 are two of my favorites! This album has great sounds and timeless feel! <br /> <br />Enjoy!!
015603252X|4.0|Same old sardonic whimsey. Repetitive intellectual arrogance. Recapitulated old political arguments as if they remain coherent living issues. Profound things have happened to Israel. Time has passed Amos Oz by.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Very bizarre and trippy.  Probably the most convincing nightmare I've seen on film.  Love those alien-worms.
B000AMUU94|5.0|This is a fabulous 3-CD collection!  A wonderful compilation of familiar -- and not so familiar -- songs from Bowie's long and impressive catalogue.  I particularly enjoyed hearing his rendition of Springsteen's \\"Saint in the City\\"!  Since I put this set in my car, I haven't listened to anything else.
B000002KHH|5.0|I think that some people that reviewed this album could have spent their time better if they were petting bunnys, or painting rainbows. I'm not a die hard metal fan, but you don't have to be to appreciate how good this album is. I can easily listen to it in my car for a week straight without even thinking about putting in another CD. Somebody wrote that they have stupid lyrics.... Compared to who? Maybe Bob Dylan, but that's different. Paranoid is a brilliant album. Every song is good, and even better if you listen to the whole album straight through.
B00000JZC4|5.0|Putting aside all of the NIN ties and industrial history of this album's creator, you should be able to focus on the beauty of this record. The production is fantastic. This record is a collection of 9 finely-written pop songs with a beautiful sonic layering of guitars and sounds. The drums sound great - a perfect blend of electronic and live drum performances. Even the lyrics, while resembling the written word of a High School Sophmore, are excellent. Lines like, \\"You know a little bit goes a long way\\" communicate feeling more than something that could have been really worked at. The lyrics suit the melodies well, and the melodies are what shines the most out of this sonic sludge of lush sound.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This is simply put, a load of hogwash.  Time after time Michael Moore uses his liberal view of the world to distort the truth.  He is still stuck on the election of 2000 and whining because his candidate didn't win.  At the hieght of this fabricated drama, NOT documentary, Moore asks congressmen if they would sacrifice their child to secure Baghdad, or Iraq or capture Hussein.  This question poses a myriad of options and opinions to me, but the main question is what WOULD you sacrifice your child for?  It is my beleif that any parent who loves their child would say NOTHING.  This question has so much spin on it, I can't believe it stays on the video.  It also implies that we send children to fight a war as if we have toddlers patrolling Baghdad for WMD's. This movie is not a waste of time however, I think it must be viewed to see what garbage the left is pulling out in their campaign to ruin George W. Bush at any cost, even lying.  Be CAREFUL and watch this movie objectively and do YOUR own research, don't take the things Michael Moore says as fact, or what I say for that matter, just question every word of every sentence uttered in this quagmire of horse manure.  Whatever you do, DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE thus supporting Michael Moore's eating disorder, just borrow it from a friend or wait till it comes on TV.
0790742780|5.0|I don't know why I missed this one, years ago!  Even today, years later, there is something within it that many of us can relate, within today's society.  I guess some things do not change, with the passage of time.  The areas of the law; (or lack of, I should say) the lack of respect for one another; and the presures of reality which can push many of us too far, are clearly present within this movie.  Also for me, the fears and pressures of a pending retirement, I can relate to very well.  It's a well done story, with interesting  insights.  I highly suggest it for mature, realistic adults.  I purchased two; one for relatives.  And as for liberals:  Avoid this movie.  The truth might frighten you.
B00005O5CM|5.0|It is SO funny and cleverly made. It seems, at first, to be a dumb movie but on closer look one can see that that's not the case. It is very clever and just so funny! Wheneve I feel depressed, I watch it and it cheers me up!
B00005MP58|4.0|The DVD is awesome.  At first it had a hard time setting up.  I don't know whether it was the dvd or my dvd player but now it is fine.  And I watch it over and over again.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|This was an awesome CD, beautifully done and melodies that really carry you away.  Enjoy!
B000067DNC|5.0|Excellent series.  Very complete.  I recomended to anyone who liked the Movie.   <br />
B00001W9G0|5.0|This is the ultimate chick flick...and how can you not love Robert Redford!  What separates it from the myriad of other \\"chick-flicks\\" is the stong politically entangled plot.  I'm not a huge Barbara Streisand fan...but I love love love this movie!
0962477060|5.0|although i've banged around on guitar for a long time (ok, a couple decades), i never could put 2+2 together and understand the basics such as how a chord is built and how things connect along the fretboard. I always thought I was just too right-brained to understand but this book really lives up the hype for me and I'm finally \\"getting it\\". It's also pretty cool how it shows you how to find any chord anywhere on the fretboard.  The author sends a lot of pointed criticism in the direction of guitar teachers who teach in a dysfunctional manner so it also gives me an excuse for not learning this stuff years ago.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Better than Private Ryan, mostly due to the commentary from the original members of Easy Company. Definitly worth the price, and a must have for any WWII movie buff. I'm not sure if there are any WWII movies which could stand up to the calibur of this series.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I did not really discover the series until the movie came out, but I love it.  I will watch this series many more times.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|i love death cab for cutie, so it's impossible for me to not like their latest album. guilty as charged
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I don't know about you but if you are over 35 the music pickings are pretty slim.  Not anymore - It's Time is a great CD.  I listen to it over and over again.  I have even turned some friends into fans.  I reommend this CD.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|The album is most definetely the strokes heaviest, as well as their most inventive, music and lyricwise. Just as a side note the booklet is really awesome too. But anyways... When i first heard the album I wasn't sure what to expect, and when it ended i wasn't sure what to think but i knew i has just heard some true originality. The melodies are very complicated, full of fantastic improvements of instrumentation from all the band. Arrangements are unique, with alot of unexpected punches that make you unable to keep up with the loads of music you're hearing at once. The guitar player, who i'm sad to say i don't knkow the name of, SORRY, has always been a legend since the first album, but on this album he really takes off, making the guitar a brand new instrument. I was really impressed with the drumming too; it sounds strange at times, but it's incredibly good. The quality is at its best as well, with the production at some sort of new peak. Fantastic album, better than any garbage the radio will ever play you.
B000002L68|5.0|It's Prince. <br /> <br />It's Purple Rain. <br /> <br />It's nothing you didn't expect, and everything you did. <br /> <br />It's the old movie soundtrack, just like you remembered it(except that it sounds better on CD now instead of vinyl). <br /> <br />And maybe, just maybe, your date for the movie from 22 years ago wants you to call. <br /> <br />So are you going to call?
B00004YKUY|1.0|I love Journey, but only with Steve Perry!  Yes, Journey was around before Steve Perry but S.P. had that special magic and the band was a huge success.  Steve A. tries to sound like Perry  but it can't be done.  They haven't made it really big with Steve A.  Van Halen had two different lead singers and they were  both totally different from one another.  Their voices were different, their style of songs were different, their image was different and Van Halen was so popular with both lead singers.  It is totally fine if a band wants to get another lead singer,  just don't try to sound like the previous one by voice or style of music.  Steve Perry had the whole package.  His stage presence was awesome and his voice is the greatest.  You really don't hear about the (new) Journey with Steve A.  You don't really hear them on the radio, see them on t.v. or anything!!  Steve Perry was the best and if he would ever go back with the band, they'd be a hit all over again.  I didn't like this CD at  all.  None of the songs made an impact on me.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This is one of the classic films of all time. Okay, it isn't terribly deep, but the combination of a dynamite cast, very decent scripting of a classic tale, spectacular sets and stuntwork and the medium of Technicolor is irresistable. <br />Olivia deHaviland has never looked lovelier nor more desirable. Flynn, is at his best, Basil Rathbone is Robin's perfect nemesis, Claude Rains brings such light hearted meanness to Prince John and the lesser characters are all top drawer. <br />My wife and I had to watch several other Technicolor costume epics to realize how very good this film is. <br />The added features are fun and informative, from the pieces on Howard Hill, the great archer who made the shots in the film, to the story of the Technicolor process, to the behind-the-scenes footage. The whole package is a treasure and a worthy addition to any DVD collection.
0859652777|5.0|Since is the 30th book I have ordered from this company, you'd think I would give alot more (if any) 5 star ratings to my previous purchases and not this book being the only one. It just goes to show that life is pretty surprising. <br />First off, let it be known that I don't listen to Marilyn Manson, I remember their first album was a disappointment for my tastes and never looked back and I'm not a satanist, so I don't even know what the hell possessed me (possessed is a good word to describe) to get this book-really I don't. <br />But to my surprise this book is pretty good-no, it's great! I love straight forward, bluntly honest authors who expose their own embarassing moments or their weaker points and like Chuck D, this guy does it all too well. <br />But here's the kicker-HE'S FUNNY AS HELL and I don't even mean it in cynical, sarcastic way. I don't think he was trying to be funny but the way he goes through his story is over-humorous. I know this because it's been eons since I have laughed out loud reading something. Hey, I'm not even finished with the book, I think I'm on the second to the last chapter before finishing but it's that good. <br />I highly recommend this book for people, anybody really, you'd be surprised.
B000063DFQ|5.0|From the beggining to end, this epic cd is as good as it gets. There are no bad songs whatsoever. This is a beloved cd to Iron Maiden fans. This is an axe players dream. Bruce belts out the lyrics from as deep down as he can grab them. I loved this cd the second I picked it up. You find that you can't help but keep popping it into your stereo or discman whenever you get the chance. Known as one of the top metal albums ever to many metal fans and Guitar One Magazine. This album seems to get better and better with every song, never letting up even a bit. To most Maiden fans (including myself) this cd is ranked near the top of their Maiden albums and even their entire collection of metal albums, and rightfully so. Even when you look at the album the first time and see Eddie standing there chained up, no arms you know it's bound to be a fast, angry, guitar shredding, metal paced album. Believe me on this one, you'll never get tired of this album. Steve Harris once again gives us a masterpiece in his song writing and shows us how classic of a metal band Maiden is. Here is how I rate the songs each  individually.<br /><br />Where Eagles Dare- 9.5/10- What an opener for this album! Fast paced metal throughout. There isn't as much singing as usually on this song and that was odd to me, but believe me when I say the instruments make well up for it.<br /><br />Revelations- 8.5/10-  At first I didn't care for it much, but it grew on me and it is actually a very decent song in every aspect and has a great intro. Bruce started his song writing with this song.<br /><br />Flight of Icarus- 10/10- A greatest hit and no wonder. Just listen to Dickinson's words being belted out while Murray and Smith belt out the addicting guitar riffs. This chorus will be in your head for days. Great song.<br /><br />Die With Your Boots On- 10/10- This is quite different from other Maiden songs, especially the chorus which seems to have wrong timing on the sing in the background and then Bruce's voice, but this differnce is a very good one. It's unique and the verses will pound into you.<br /><br />The Trooper- 10/10- One of my top 5 favorite Maiden songs ever! It is such a great Maiden anthem. The intro gets you going, and when the chorus rolls around, there's no turning back. A great war chant, and an amazing song.<br /><br />Still Life- 9/10- What is essentially the title track, this songs comes heavily at you, and doesn't stop trudging. This is an all aroung great song.<br /><br />Quest For Fire- 8.5/10- A good song with somewhat bewildering lyrics. It has a very catchy chorus and Bruce sounds great all the way through.<br /><br />Sun and Steel- 8.5/10- Good song with a cool chorus that makes you want to bob your head. Great signature bass galloping in intro and verse by Steve Harris.<br /><br />To Tame A Land- 9.5/10- A great way to end the album off. When I listen to this song I think that it must have taken Murray and Smith forever to come up with the guitar parts(especially on intro and right after first verse) bec. they are phenomenol. Maiden does an amazing job here on ending the cd off with a very soothing, clean sounding song.<br /><br />Defenitely a must have for all Iron Maiden fans. Run out to the store if you don't have a copy or buy it here on line, but just get it. You need The Trooper somewhere in your inventory. It's too great to pass up. Definitely worth every cent of money.good one. It's unique and the verses will pound into you.    The Trooper- 10/10- One of my top 5 favorite Maiden songs ever! It is such a great Maiden anthem.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I wanted to support Joss Whedon so much that as soon as I saw this movie on Netflix I ordered it right away from Amazon, just to support the cause. I loved the TV series too.
B000063DI8|4.0|4 stars. This cd in my opinion is very underrated. Many people say Bruce Dickinson is lacking in vocals, but in my opinion he sounds just how he always has . Also, many people call this the beggining of a worse phase for Maiden. Also not true. I own  every album and not one has dissapointed me, even though many people bash certain cds(The X Factor and Virtual XI in particular, which I love).It bewilders me why so many people don't appreciate this album for what it is-a plain, all around good metal album. It has a great raw metal sound to it. It's definitely Maiden.<br /><br />The cd is fully packed with much energy. Listen to The Assassin and you'll see what I mean. Tailgunner, Holy Smoke, and Bring Your Daughter.... were all songs most Maiden fans enjoyed and in the same sense greatest hits(rightly so). My personal favorite tracks are Mother Russia and No Prayer For The Dying. Mother Russia is a great fast paced rock song full of great guitar work and spooky sounding keyboards, which put a nice effect on the song at the intro/outro. No Prayer For The Dying is full of meaning and Bruce really puts great effort into this song. It begins slow and on the chorus breaks out into a great guitar sounding melody. Public Enema is agood song, but is lacking something though I don't know what. Fates Warning is my 2nd least favorite song. It doesn't have the driving force behind it that most Maiden songs do. The one track I dont care too much for is Hooks In You. It just doesn't have the Maiden sound that we all know and love.<br /><br />All in all, I believe this to be a great cd, and if you haven't done so , go pick yourself up a copy. You won't regret it. NPFTD is just another great Maiden album. It is sometimes overlooked by many fans and should be given more credit than it usually is.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Not only is Sin City the best Film Noir style graphic novel ever, the fact that Rodriguez could make such a faithful adaptation to film is really amazing
B0001KL5DA|5.0|The series is good as a whole, and the second season is full of enough plot twists to keep my interested. A good buy.
B00005QXDD|4.0|While not appropriate for many audiences, fans of Jack Black and his style of humor will appreciate the \\"D\\".  The lyrics are mostly nonsense and obviously JB and KG had fun, but they are suprisingly talented musically.  For an even better experience I recommend the Tenacious D two-disc DVD.  It has all the episodes from their HBO series, a live concert, music videos and more.  Some versions of their songs are better on the DVD but this CD has more songs.
B000683VI4|5.0|GREAT MOVIE,  RACHEL MCADAMS IS AWESOME,  NICE PERFORMANCE AND GRAET PHOTO SHOTS
B00005R5G9|4.0|I loved this movie.  Kinda' dopey, but that is the type of movie Andrew McCarthy was starring in at that time.  Weekend At Bernies kinda' stuff.  Dumb plot, but SOOOO addicting!  FUN to watch if you are a fan of the late 80's early 90's.  What can I say, its almost a classic that you have to watch.  I'm sure Mystery Science Theater would have a ball with the movie.  I loved it.
B0000029DD|1.0|Regrettably, \\"Hallelujah\\" is the one track worth listening to on this Jeff Buckley CD.  Although he was most assuredly gifted, talented and promising, this CD does nothing to buttress that opinion.  One wants a more varied and nuanced portrait of this man and he is no longer with us to provide that diversity.
0689853637|4.0|Beautiful book. Amazing how everything fits together.  Very delicate.  Not for young hands.
3822822558|5.0|If your a fan of edgey, vice magazine type of photography and enjoy the seedy side of life, then by all means man, get this book!
B00000K3CK|5.0|Always one of those must see movies during the Christmas season. Superb acting from an all star cast and the DVD offers the purity of classic Black and White filming. The updated version pales in comparison.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Having loved the movie, even though it wasn't totally true to the book, the score is a very pleasant reminder of a different time and place.  I listen to it often.

0060899190|5.0|The book of the website contains funny, heartfelt, moving, sad and celebratory postcards made by readers and sent in to Frank Warren for the world to enjoy, and maybe find comfort knowing that someone else shares their secret (I know I did). <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book for those who want to smile, empathise and wonder at the beauty some create from their pain, and how a postcard can encapsulate so much.
B000002GJH|4.0|Temple of the dog was a tribute to a a singer who was more famous with the Seattle music scene than with any fan.  He died as a result of a heroin overdose, which is a cliche within a cliche within a cliche (rockstars, Seattle and grunge).  The album was cobbled together by members of Sound Garden and Pearl Jam as a final farewell to the singer.  While it emobodies some of the best elements of grunge and hard rock, Temple of The Dog does stretch credulity in that it borders on being trite and self-endulgant.  Still, it is musically tight and the musicianship is first-rate.  The songs \\"Hunger Strike\\" and \\"Say Hello to Heaven\\" received a lot of air play in the Seattle Market.  This and the dirty chorused guitars has made Temple of the Dog a genuine 90s artifact.
B00004YM0D|5.0|Excellent soundtrack! I bought one a couple of years ago and my son took it over so I ordered another.....won't be disappointed.

B000AA305M|5.0|I loved 'White ladder' with it's folk/electronica sound. However, David Gray tops that with this release, his seventh.<br /><br />With lyrics as cryptic as ever, and piano and guitar pushed to the fore, the CD opens with the theatrical string intro of 'Alibi', which leads to a stirring vocal performance set to a paino/string backdrop, with more instruments filtering in. Lovely!<br /><br />'The one I love' and 'Hospital food' are upbeat songs in the mould of 'Babylon' from 'White ladder'.<br /><br />'Nos da cariad' (Goodnight my love in Welsh) is a melodic neo folk tune with soaring vocals. One of my favourites.<br /><br />'Slow motion' is a beautiful ballad with repetitive, surreal lyrics. Jangly guitars announce 'From here you can almost see the sea', a lovely folk ballad.<br /><br />'Aint no love' is a piano ballad with dreamy backing vocals.<br /><br />Closing out the set is the haunting epic ballad, 'Disappearing world'. Like a reviewer mentioned, very Bowie like.<br /><br />And as always, stunning cover photography to accompany the music.<br /><br />Like I said, his best CD yet!!
0385507755|5.0|Yes, I've heard the hoorah about the Oprah thing.  I've seen the Larry King thing too.  I read the news stories, and heard Oprah whine about being lied to.  SO WHAT!!!  I've read the book.<br /><br />So maybe James embellished some parts, maybe he was only in jail for a few hours.  Having been in jail myself, a few hours could have seemed like weeks and weeks. Maybe the part about Lily sounded better in the book than the way it ACTUALLY went down.  Again, SO WHAT!!  A life still ended!! The book stands on it's own.  It has helped millions of people with their addictions and it has been a guiding light for me personally having just went through a very similar life and recovery.  It is now my Alcoholic Bible and anytime I feel like falling off the wagon I just open that book to any random page, read it for awhile and the feeling goes away.  James Frey and his books have become my sponsors and I can turn to them whenever I need them.<br /><br />I normally don't pull out the race card, but I can't help but wonder, if James were black, would Oprah have treated him so shamefully??  HMMMM?  Maybe you should read this book with this warning.....\\"Careful, some parts of this book have been slightly embellished to emphasize importance and sometimes just to make it a bit more interesting to read.  As written, this could happen to you, too.\\"<br /><br />James' second book \\"My Friend Leanord\\" is also one of the most interesting stories that I have ever read.  I recommend it highly, as well.<br /><br />Whew!  I've been dying to get that off my chest for a long time.  Please read the book and see if you don't agree.

B000A59PMO|5.0|The first season of Veronica Mars is an outstanding accomplishment.It transcends genre, combining everything that is great about drama,action and comedy. <br /> <br />It went well beyong my expectations when I first saw it.If you want to get into Veronica Mars, buy this DVD set to get caught up.I can watch these episodes again and again. <br /> <br />There are not a lot of additional features, but that doesn't matter as the quality of the episodes makes up for this, who needs anything but the episodes? <br /> <br />The deleted scenes are nice to see, but it is easy tosee why they cut them for time. <br /> <br />Season 2 is still setting the bar very high, and I'll be sure to get the Second season dvd when it comes out to watch it again.I enjoy this so show so much, and if your also a fan of Lost, tivo Lost and watch this instead. <br /> <br />Season 2 continues in March I can't wait! <br /> <br />
B00004Y6NP|5.0|All through the 80's and early 90's I traveled the Southeast setting up large sound reinforcement for concert and events. In my travels I had been lucky enough to work with Dire Straits, Toto (and many others). I received a Toto CD (1983) Toto IV, and a Dire Straits cassette, Brothers In Arms (1985). These lived in the Road Case with the Tascam 112R and the Techniques SLP. They, the CD and Cassette were used at every location to setup audio levels. Subsequently I became immune to both bodies of work. Not long ago the WORN OUT cassette of Brothers In Arms resurfaced and encouraged me to listen to it. I then became motivated to buy the CD and give a real listen. I suggest that you do the same. If you do not like this type of music you should pick something else to review and listen to. If you are trying to compare today with yesterday that will always be invalid, hey! Yesterday (unless you were born yesterday) is ALWAYS BETTER THAN TODAY! There is NO BAD CUT ON THIS ALBUM, period. They might not fit your taste, your problem. Mark Knopfler has only two rivals in the unique, catchy, cannot stop humming them guitar hook areana, Paul and Eric. I will admit that many of the lyrics I do not understand. I like them but they are either too simple or I am. In example from The Man's Too Strong, <br />\\"I have legalized robbery, called it belief <br />I have run with the money, I have hid like a thief <br />Re-written history with armies and my crooks <br />Invented memories, I did burn all the books\\" <br />I close this review with my favorite lyric that even I understand. It is both evocative and provocative but is the most delicately put version of this statement that I have ever seen. <br />Well the sun rose on the courtyard and they all did hear him say <br />\\"You always was a Judas, but I got you anyway <br />You may have got your silver but I swear upon my life <br />Your sister gave me diamonds and I gave 'em to your wife\\"  <br />Even I understand THAT! <br />
B000002U82|5.0|Blue Racer: Squash and Squeak hit the nail right on head. Japanese Beetle: Serpent son, this Pink Floyd classic is still great after 40 years Blue Racer: Why does a Cranky guy and his lovers trash art Japanese Beetle: Lemme tell you this Serpent son, disrespecting Dark Side of the Moon is as bad as disrespecting a classic movie like The Exorcist(both are works of art and we both think Linda Blair is hot). Blue Racer: Dark Side has my favorites Breathe, Money, Us and Them and Brain Damage/Eclipse. Japanese Beetle: no wonder this album has sold almost 40 million copies worldwide as the songs are timeless. Blue Racer: Will Justin Stinkercrate be remembered. Japanese Beetle: HAASAH!(chops Justin picture in half). Japanese Beetle: Will they remember Pink Floyd? Blue Racer: Of course. SAYONARA!
078401213X|3.0|This guy is a freakin wierd o! But its got some cool points for what there trying to get across. But there in lies the problem. Seems i get lost part of the way threw. More so cause the guy himself is losing base with reality at times. Hey if you put a drill to your head i think you might be losing it as well. Definitly original though. Rent before you buy would be a better thing to go with though.
B000BVD460|1.0|Blue Racer: Say, isn't this man the charter member of The Dish it But Can't Take It Club. Japanese Beetle: Sure is Serpent Son. Blue Racer: Eminem(or as we call him phleghminem) is a white who thinks he's black. Japanese Beetle: This bigot made fun of Moby and then when Moby made fun of him back he got hot and bothered. Blue Racer: Rap is what John Entwistle once said crap. Japanese Beetle: This Vanilla Ice carbon-copy should be HAASAH(karate chops Eminem cardboard cut-out)ed out of here. Sayonara!
B00000K31V|5.0|This movie starts off running and keeps on going faster and faster. The acting a prety par for the course. Most movies like this just try to do what it can to make it work. Kind of like all the props they use are a little bit far fetched but then again it is Sci Fi. It is a mystery if you like mystery. I'd to see it on tv before you buy it. My sense of reality is a bit warped so i would watch pretty much anything. Enjoy with some pop corn and your favorite friend :)
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Blue Racer: Say this movie was awesome. Japanese Beetle: The last reviewer was probably watching Brokeback Mountain(a crummy movie) when he reviewed this. Blue Racer: Scarface is timeless and people still quote lines from the movie today. Japanese Beetle: Also, the film could have taken place in modern day society and not scream out of date. watch now or HAASAH(karate chop)!!! Sayonara!!!
0767821629|5.0|I got to say i love these type of movies. The mystery is definitly great! I think the story is a definite original  compared to some movies that just get remade. Acting was good, there is only one love scene and that is not much. So for a show that just goes on its merits vice trying to sell T & A, its great! So if you want a neat little spin that keeps it well with in the realm of the original the Thirteenth Floor is for you :)
0743454529|5.0|I was just browsing through some books when I came across this book, and it was the intriguing coverpage that made me pick it up. I had never heard of Jodi Picoult before this. But this one book has turned me into a fan. <br /> <br />Revolving around this little girl called Anna, \\"My sister's Keeper\\" is the story of a family struggling with Leukaemia. The writing style is extremely refreshing. The same set of circumstances, are talked about by each character - how he feels about it, how he views himself in the situation. The chapters begin with the names of the characters they talk about. When you begin reading one chapter and are thinking of the one character it is talking about, the chapter ends, and you view the same situation from the other character's eyes as the next one begins. Truly amazing.  <br /> <br />The ending of the story is something that you never expect.  <br /> <br />The book makes you nod in agreement at the authenticity of the emotions and feelings described. It makes you cry rivers at the depth of hopelessness of certain situations.  <br /> <br />The book is certainly un-put-downable. A must-read, without any doubt.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Opeth 6th album released in 2002. This is by far THE Opeth album. I know I said My Arms Your Hearse is my favorite but now this has topped it in my book, easliy.    Most fans may say that Blackwater Park, Still Life or MAYH are Opeth's finest, don't get me wrong they all are masterpieces and they had great songwriting, this is IMO an improvement (although not by far), this is the band's heaviest and most melodic work to date, although it has some slower moments with clean vocals & acoustic guitars, like the ballad-like 'A Fair Judgement', which is easily one of their best acoustic songs. I think that Mikael, Peter (Guitars) and Martin Lopez (Drums) have improved their work from their earlier efforts, especially Lopez who's one of the best metal drummers ever. Not to mention, EXCELLENT PRODUCTION, this is one of the best metal albums ever produced. And for the very matter, this album has my all-time favorite Opeth song, the title track (Deliverance), which clocks about 13:30 mins, and no single moment of it is boring, the opening riff is amazing, the solos are great also, the closing note is probably my favorite part of the song. 'Wreath', which is the opening track is probably the heaviest song on the album, It's 11 mins of a heavy assault with excellent drum beats, no acoustic passages (except the outro), no clean vocals, just raw, fast and heavy. 'A Fair Judgement' one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Althought it's kinda depressing Mikael's clean vocals (there are no growls in this song) are in top notch, and it has some really haunting riff in toward the end. The album closes wit 'By the Pain I see in Others', which is the longest and another one of the best songs on the album. All the songs are amazing, there is absolutely no filler here or a song I wanna skip. Don't let the fact that there are only 6 songs here fool you, there's one short instrumental which clocks about 2 mins (For Absent Friends) and all the other tracks are at least 10 mins. Opeth put quality before quantity, and this is why this blows out of water any nu-metal/metalcore album from bands like Slopknot, Mudlame, Limp Bizcrap, Killsuck Engage etc. which has about 5898589567 (whatever) tracks and they all suck so it doesn't matter.    As I said, this album from the whole Opeth library is easily my favorite. If you like any kind of metal (Death or Progressive), start here if you are new to the band. If you don't like death metal or just can't stand the growls, I'll suggest to start with this album's followup record, 'Damnation' which has no guitar-crushing or growls, or their most recent 'Ghost Reveries' which combines both ideas and in my view their 2nd best album, so you an get into the band's basics. Opeth is one hell of a band and this album is one of the very best albums ever. I know I sound like I'm overprasing this album, but honestly I can't say enough good things about it. This is already one of my top 5 favorite albums. No metal collection is complete without this gem.    Opeth rules!!!
0786852550|5.0|This was a great book that I would highly suggest anyone interested in the fantasy genre to read.  Nathaniel the main charecter is one of those rare strong charecters that has many flaws about himself but still does the right thing in the end.  Jonathan Stroud did an excellent job with portraying the Djinni and how their interaction with the wizards and regulars works.  I loved this book and plan to read the rest of the trilogy even though it is for a much younger age group.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|As a dancer and lover of exquisite music I really appreciate the ballroom music as Michael Buble presents and executes it. <br /> <br />So very romantic. The tempo, beat, cadence - all superbly done. His rich vocal tember renders the musical chords with a richness I've never heard before. If he had been Sinatra - Sinatra would have been alot more popular. While those of us from the older generation loved some of those songs, Mr. Buble represents them with a fresh new blending of passion and committment that Sinatra never had. Bravo Mr. Buble!  When will the next album be out?
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Having been a fan of Buffy & Angel, I was really looking forward to this series by Joss Whedon.  I only got to see one episode before the series was canceled so I bought the DVDs for my husband's birthday.  <br /> <br />We weren't disappointed!  Joss Whedon's shows always have the best dialogue, sly jokes, and wonderfully quirky characters.  I only wish the series had been given a longer time to grow.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|This is the most wonderful series.  My 15 - year-old, 19 -year-old, his friends and myself are all hooked.  The writing on this series is awesome and the fact it appeals to all ages.  It is clean, well written and encourages good relationships with family and friends
B000E1YVZU|5.0|It was the last day of school before Thanksgiving break. I trotted downstairs to check the paper. A movie I was going to see received a negative review. Hours later, I saw that movie. That critic didn't know jack.  <br /> <br />That movie was  <br /> <br />RENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />This adaptation of an equally awesome Broadway musical is far from another nail in the coffin of the movie musical. In fact, it is another nail pried off said coffin.  <br /> <br />Fans will approach this film with hesitation since it is directed by Chris Columbus (Harry Potter and Home Alone) and starring six of the original eight leading cast members from the original Broadway cast as well as the girl who went topless in Alexander and some girl who no one has probably ever heard of before. <br /> <br />Be not afraid: Columbus knows what he is doing, the six cast members look like they left the show last week (in that they look as young as ever) and the two newbies fit in as if they were there from the beginning.  <br /> <br />All the musical numbers are translated effectively onto the screen. Rather than being completely sung through like onstage, the film contains a good deal of dialogue. Also, a veeeeeeeeeeeeeeery noticeable change is the rearranging of Seasons of Love as the opening number when onstage it opens Act II. What some may consider blasphemy, this customer calls a very good call. Doing the show as it was written would not have worked for film and since Seasons of Love is the most famous song, it's better to start the film off. Like the two new cast members, Seasons of Love feels lik it's been the opening number all along and the dialogue feels like it's been a part of the show forever. <br /> <br />Now to the cast: <br /> <br />Anthony Rapp is back as Mark Cohen, the aspiring filmmaker. Having only heard him on the soundtrack, he's even better on film. <br /> <br />Adam Pascal, who I had the pleasure of seeing in Aida early in its run, is amazing as Roger Davis, the HIV+ musician looking to write \\"one great song\\" before he leaves this world. Love his hairdo as well.  <br /> <br />Idina Menzel, who I had the pleasure of seeing in Wicked shortly after she won her Tony, kicks ass as Maureen Johnson, Mark's lesbian ex-girlfriend. She's sexy, she's funny, she's sassy. You gotta love it. <br /> <br />Taye Diggs, Idina's real life husband, is equally excellent as Benjamin Coffin III aka Benny, the sellout landlord who married some rich bimbo and is trying to evict his friends. Frankly, his talents are underused. He only gets one good song to himself and it's over far too quickly. <br /> <br />Wilson Jermaine Heredia reprises his Tony winning role as Angel, the cross-dressing HIV+ street musician who wins the heart of another man and the audience. He has a voice like an angel, and man does he make an attractive woman. <br /> <br />Jesse L. Martin steals the show as Tom Collins, an HIV+ ex-NYU professor. His voice is like velvet, he brings huge laughs (stealing the movie when he bursts into the apartment declaring a \\"Merry Christmas, bitches!\\"), and his rendition of the reprise of \\"I'll Cover You\\" is my favorite moment of the show. Hell, he's my favorite character in the piece. <br /> <br />The newbies are Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson. <br /> <br />Tracie Thoms is superior to Fredi Walker, the original Joanne. As the lesbian lawyer who Maureen leaves Mark for, she wins the audience over with her kick-ass voice and humor. Ironically, she has auditioned several times for Rent. Let's hope she makes it to the actual show in the near future. <br /> <br />Rosario Dawson is a wild spitfire as Mimi, the (you guessed it) HIV+ S&M dancer. She could dance circles around Daphne Rubin-Vega, the original Mimi, and is a hell of a lot prettier. She sings and dances like a pro too. <br /> <br />With cameos by Aisha de Haas (another original cast member) as a bag lady and Sarah Silverman as tabloid newshost Alexi Darling, the cast is a joy towatch. <br /> <br />Add to this joyous Bohemian celebration some sorely overlooked cinematography and you have a film that made this reviewer turn to his Dad and say, \\"I'm so happy!\\" <br /> <br />Overall grade: A+
B000BKJ78U|4.0|As other reviewers have stated, this set is the same as the set released a year ago minus the bonus DVD and $10.  It does not have the original cut of the trilogy, but I knew this when I bought it.  What I got it for was the much improved artwork on the box and I was expecting the same for the DVD's inside.  Unfortunately, the artwork inside hasn't changed.  Too bad because I loved the original artwork used for the packaging of the VHS versions when they were first issued.   It was basically the miniature version of their movie posters.  Oh how I would've liked to see the original  Empire Strikes Back artwork for this DVD.  But despite the lack of improved artwork for the DVD's and the non-inclusion of the original cut of the trilogy, I was impressed by the amazing picture quality.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The Star Wars trilogy is finally out on DVD. And George Lucas tinkered some more with it. Just be glad he didn't replace Yoda with the CGI version from Episode II and III. <br /> <br />First of all, let's start with the movies: <br /> <br />A New Hope:  <br /> <br />The first ever Star Wars movie is easily the best. It's just an old fashioned fairy tale. You have the innocent hero in Luke Skywalker, the evil villain in Darth Vader (even though the prequels will change all that), the damsel in distress (albeit, one who will kick some ass before she's done) in Princess Leia, and so on and so forth. <br /> <br />The cast gives memorable performances but it's the visual effects that steal the show (and also get the Oscar). I did not see Star Wars until the 1997 re-release so I really have no problem with some of the \\"tinkerings\\" courtesy of George Lucas. <br /> <br />The one noticeable tinkering on this DVD that I have no problem with is the fixing up of Jabba the Hutt who was barely recognizable in the 1997 re-release. <br /> <br />The Empire Strikes Back: <br /> <br />Another amazing movie, probably better than the first Star Wars. More memorable characters, more amazing special effects, and of course, more tinkerings. I actually don't have a problem with the addition of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor hologram or Temuera Morrison rerecording Boba Fett's lines. It helps to keep the trilogy consistent with the prequels. <br /> <br />Return of the Jedi: <br /> <br />This movie pulls out all the stops, even though it is a bit more excessive than it's toned down predecessors. The biggest tinkering that I do have a problem with is the substitution of Sebastian Shaw by Hayden Christiansen. That just made me go, \\"Huh?\\"  <br /> <br />All in all, they are amazing films and will forever be land marks in the history of film. Unfortunately, these changes mean that future viewers may end up watching the prequels first. But as long as Star Wars is in our lives, all is right with the universe. <br /> <br />May the Force be with you.
0060507772|5.0|Exactly what you'd expect from Pratchett and the Silver Horde.  The added dimension this time is Paul Kidby's art which is magnificent.
0156027321|5.0|I have to say, one of the best books I've read of recent..nothing more I can offer!!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I've been an Enya fan for years, and this is as fine as anything she's done.  Any devotees of Celtic music will love it.  In particular, fans of Loreena McKennitt, Secret Garden, Eden's Bridge and Celtic Woman will revel in Enya's lovely vocals and instrumentals.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is a sweet surprise of a movie.  I originally read the book about the time this movie came out in December since I usually find the book is better than the movie.  I was delightfully surprised by the emotional sweep and characters portrayed in this movie.  It holds very true to the book and improves in the telling of the tale.   <br />I need to say that I was floored by the ending and half the audience in the showing I saw were openingly weeping at the tragic conclusion.  Myself included and I firmly suggest that you bring tissues with you.  A sleeve is not the best place to wipe your tears on, it will get soaked!  I will buy this movie when it comes out on DVD!
B000002HO3|5.0|This album is a collection of Simply Red's best. It is a great album - would recommend it to anyone who has liked any one of their songs. \\"Stars\\" is the best song for me; no matter how many times I've listened to it in the past n years, it is the best. \\"Something Got Me Started\\", \\"Fairground\\" are also excellent.
0375822070|5.0|I read this book so frequently when I was a child that my copy literally fell apart.  I've now purchased a copy to read to my own son and am sure that he will enjoy the story of the determined fox family that consistently outwits the greedy farmers just as much as I did.  I always liked Roald Dahl's books because they were not the usual sunshine and teddy bear genre of most children's books.  Instead, the focus is on overcoming adversity with a bit of humor and a lot of sass.
0790729385|4.0|This was a scary film but not the scariest in my opinion. There were a few things in this film that didn't make sense but that's with any movie I guess. The only movie that has ever literally sent chills up my spine was \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\\" That movie is truly frightening.
B000002552|5.0|This album is on my \\"trapped on a desert island list\\". I recently replaced it because I gave it to a friend who had never heard it. It is a great change in flow for Dylan in the band and is likely one of the most diverse albums Dylan ever put out. The sound is haunting and rugged. I am from New Orleans and miss the jam sessions in bars like the Funky Butt or the Apple Barrel. Bars where guys would show up and just play. That is what this album feels like; raw and unproduced beauty.  <br />The album was recorded in a house in Woodstock, NY that was known as Big Pink. The Band released a more produced version of many of the songs which was called Music from Big Pink. This album includes the Dylan tracks and takes you on a journey of Rockabilly jams and funky cords. Dylan's beat poet ranting on Clothes Line Saga is incredible. The Band lands some haunting southern sounds with Ain't No More Cane and Dylan's Crash on the Levee has a new meaning to a generation who just lost one of it's most beloved cities. <br />Musically it's not as refined and produced as most people like their music today. The whole album is one of those \\"best albums no one knows about\\".
B00005JMYI|2.0|Couldn't wait for it to be over.  Didn't think it was particularly funny, thought it was kind of stupid.
0671027344|5.0|I give The Perks of Being a Wallflower a rating of 5 stars. I enjoyed the book immensely. It was unlike any book I have ever read, not only by his use of diction, but by the format in which Chbosky used. The letters that Charlie submits not only give you an idea of what is going on in his public life, but an in depth look into his private life. These letters that he writes are basically journal entries, which make the book unique and interesting. As a fellow teen I feel I can relate with this book, even though it is dramatized a bit. <br /> Charlie is a young boy that is forced to do what every teenager feels the most: going into high school without any friends. He has just recently endured the suicide of one of his closest friends, and has been in and out of the hospital ever since. Suffering through his mental issues, Charlie attends high school stuck in the shadow of his stud athlete brother that is now a running back at Penn State. His English teacher soon learns that he is a very gifted student and gives him extra books to keep Charlie's mind busy. By the time football games start, Charlie has made a couple friends. It is through these friends that he encounters his first high school crush in a senior girl named Sam. She is an exotic beauty, with a habit of chain smoking and doing drugs. Charlie eventually fits the mold of the modern day teen, and starts smoking and doing drugs. Through Sam he is introduced to parties and to more friends. They give him the label wallflower because he doesn't talk much, he just listens and understands. The year of high school continues and Charlie is in and out of relationships. As the year draws to a close, Sam and Charlie's relationship gets more intense. They even have sex for the first time. This only makes the goodbye harder for Charlie because Sam, also going to Penn State, prepares to leave for college. They savor the last few days together and attend lots of parties. Sam soon leaves and Charlie is unable to handle the burden. He goes insane and gets admitted to the hospital once again. The book ends as he is getting out, and he finally comes to the realization that everything will be alright, even in the worst of times. <br />
0553573403|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was so awesome that I couldn't wait to start the next book in the series.  I have read other series when by the end of the first book I am really tired of all of the characters but definitely not this book.  It is so well written that you cannot wait to find out what happens next.  I usually don't read fantasy but I am hooked on this series.
B0000X61UU|5.0|this workout is challenging but do-able no matter what your fitness level. i like the way it utilizes exercises from a wide range of athletics and provides a whole body workout that you can either do straight through or segment to fit your schedule. and cindy's hair is just so pretty and shiny as she does sit ups in the desert sunset.
B00004SZWD|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this.  If you're a Stevie fan, you absolutely must have this one in your collection.  This cd represents what music should be!
B0000844I8|5.0|Finaly we have time to see the beginning of a great serie.<br /><br />We have all the seasons already but now also the premiere movie and time to watch it ;-)<br /><br />Great work !
B00007KWHO|3.0|Yes hit their stride with the album that would follow \\"Time and a Word,\\" and I suspect I'm not alone in that this album did not find its way onto my turntable, or today into my CD player, as much as \\"The Yes Album\\" and those that followed.  However, if you like Yes, this their second offering is worth having.  Without Steve Howe, this band had not quite attained excellence, but there are fine songs here.  \\"Then\\" sounds the most like a classic Yes song and features some excellent bass playing by Chris Squire.  \\"Astral Traveller\\" and \\"Time and a Word\\" are nice songs.  None of the songs drag, they are fine efforts, they just don't attain the greatness of the following albums.   <br /> <br />The Rhino re-release is excellent.  As usual, the Rhino liner notes and improved sound quality make it worthwhile rebuying this album.  I recommend this CD for prog rock fans. <br />
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I am not a movie geek. I want to make it clear. But more and more often, I found that American movies got dried out thier creativity and tend to boring to dead. This Korean movie is very exotic,at least to the eyes of people who are not Koreans. There is no \\"Korean traditional\\" stuff in it. But still, it is very exotic. The time in the movie is 2002 or 2003, so it is very modern. The motif of the movie, however, is very very universal. I will not leak the actual story, because it ruins your fun for the movie. But this one is gory but fresh, brutal but tender, sad but funny, and hidious but beautiful. I know it sounds strange. But that is true. I talked with my friends about this movie and found that many girls just don't like it, partially because they are not into the motif that the movie is based on. But most of guys love it. I personally think they like the \\"sexy\\" part of this movie. I mean it's not like XXX or red marked adult movie but still the hidden theme is very... well... lacy. Hope it triggers your interest.
0060234814|5.0|As soon as I opened the book I was transformed to a place and time of wonderment.  This adventure of the children and how each one handled their own personal struglles brought a smile to my face and a warmth in my heart.  We all can learn so much from how each child entered this land called Narnia and how they grew with each new encounter that they made.  I also enjoyed the fact that not everone is perfect, yet forgiveness and love can get you through hard times.  My nephew and I read it at the same time.  I enjoyed so much hearing his thoughts also.  A must read.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I'm quite sure Team America - Unrated is the best movie I will ever see in my entire life..... and..... I PROMISE I WILL NEVER DIE!!!!  (You'll understand when you watch this movie).  And YOU WILL watch Team America!!!  (Otherwise you'll never know what THE SIGNAL is!!!   <br /> <br />I own two copies of this movie.... one to loan to friends and one to keep here at home for WHENEVER I have to fill the urge to hear the TEAM AMERICA THEME SONG! <br /> <br />Oh, don't bother with the rated R version.... go BIG or GO HOME!  Get the UNRATED!  You'll be glad you did!
B0007TKNL0|2.0|Having seen the show 15 times with both Broadway Casts, and Traveling casts, I must say that the Phantom in the movie had a far worse singing voice than anyone I have ever seen play that role. I was very disappointed
B00070Q7VO|5.0|The glowing accolades that have been bestowed on this artist for his singing style and ability are well deserved. I sat captivated by this Wiltern Theater (it's a magnificent venue) experience and for once it's pleasing to see all the hype and media exposure surrounding an artist be of his down home qualities and not some tabloid making exploits. Apparently he's a warm man with family values and hasn't let his success go to his head. If nothing else this dvd lets you glimpse the real man and his amazing voice, and the glimpse leaves me impressed and wanting to hear and see more of him.
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against The Machine's self titled album is without a doubt one of the greatest albums of all time, and it's also their absolute best album ever. I've had this album since my junior year in high school, and I still listen to it to this day. Words just can't describe how much I love this album. The blend of rap and metal go perfectly with the politically charged lyrics.

B000002UAU|5.0|You know how you always here music artists say that they haven't yet made their SGT PEPPER'S album yet, and that statement means that PEPPER'S is the huge standard by which other's are judged, well, this is a hugely overrated album, and there are a few other albums from 1967 that I like far better than Sgt.Pepper's. Like the brilliant Moody Blues album DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, and has anyone else heard of an album called DISRAELI GEARS by a group called Cream? I have probably about 200 albums that I like better than Pepper's, but still as you see, I've given it a full five star rating because it still is a superb album, and has some super tunes on it, and I like to pull it out every couple of years and spin it a few times, but I still think ABBY ROAD, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, REVOLVER, and RUBBER SOUL are fairly superior to PEPPER'S. I still have a very hard time believing that \\"Lucy in the sky with Diamonds\\" isn't about the drug LSD. Even though John Lennon staunchly denied that that was true. When you hear a song like that, and you know that they have experimented with the drug, it's hard to believe that the songs about anything else, but who knows for sure? I bet I won't get to many helpful votes because I'm kind of downgrading this classic, but I'm just giving my humble thoughts on an overrated album.
B000BJ7BCA|5.0|The product was just what I ordered.  It arrived as stated and the whole process went very smoothly.  I am very satisfied with the product.

B000002GFC|3.0|Great CD... however: there were many cuts that could have been left off and would  not be  missed. I would rather have had Quality than quanity on this CD.  This was not the CD I thought it was
B0000CFW87|5.0|I am not a music lover, most of the time I listen to the radio in my car, but one day I listened to Josh Groban singing Ava Maria and I was lost, now instead of listening the radio in the car I listen to Josh Groban DVD's.
B000001EL3|5.0|To be a fan of Kiss, one has to put up with a lot of the BS that they've pulled (i.e over the top money crubbing, putting other guys in Ace and Peters makeup).  But through it all, the one thing that's undeniable is they may some of the most memorable music, and it doesn't get any better that that this album.  Buy it, you'll be glad you did.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X-2 is so good! It is so amazing. I can't describe it. The graphics are so much better. and i'm am so glad that thay added nightcraller. I can't what for X-3 to come out.I really recommend  it!!!!!!!!!!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This is one of the best live albums out there. I am not a big Mayer fan but this record is hot. The music is great. These guys can really jam. Hopefully Mayer will quit the solo thing and go full time with the John Mayer Trio. The Music industry needs this type of record. Buy it!!! You won't be dissapointed. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Excellent CD that completes a great collection. It is as good as the three previous one. I must recommend it to any one that enjoys good old music sang by the best.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in ages. I watched with my granddaughters then purchased from Amazon and sat with my husband and watched a few days later.  Excellent movie with surprise ending.  A must see!  A true romance, well written, with a hint of nostalgia.
B0000TB05A|5.0|Excelente concierto en el castillo Slane en IRLANDA, Bono se entrega a su publico, buen sonido, buenas imagenes, magnificos extras. LO RECOMIENDO DOS HORAS DE U2
B000002GQJ|4.0|This cd by the Moody Blues, is different to the other albums they recorded during this period because the songs have more melody and also each one is so different in structure and sound that makes a joy to listen to. The best songs are \\"Its up to You\\", \\"Melancholy Man\\" (a moderate FM hit), \\"Dont you fell small\\", \\"Questions\\" (with a similar structure to the The Who s' Pinball Wizard). <br /> <br />This is an exelent cd by a one of Britain s' best Rock bands ever. For me their best cd es \\"Every Good Boy Deserves a Favor\\". <br /> <br />
B0000CBHOI|5.0|I couldn't stop watching (and listening!).  Very interesting and great blues music/history.  3am in the morning and there I am putting the next DVD in to watch some more.  If you have any interest in blues music, you will thoroughly enjoy this set.

0060872675|5.0|This is book is hilarious.  It reads like a children's picture book, but it has the definite mark of Terry Pratchett's humor.  I've been an avid fan of Mr. Pratchett for some time and this book is great, especially in conjunction with Thud!.  The best line really is, \\"He'll see them on a plate, They go sizzle!\\"
B00070Q7VO|2.0|I bought this CD for the song HOME and expected the same type of music for the remainder of the CD. To my dissapointment the CD had all remakes of music I didn't care for. But with his twist on the oldies crap we're all so sick of it was enjoyable....but I sill threw it away! Sorry!
0307276902|1.0|After the controversy about this book, I refused to read it & returned it to Amazon for a refund.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a wonderfully enjoyable series.  This Sci-Fi meets Western meets noir vision of our future is just a pleasure to be a part of.  Well written plots, engaging characters, breathtaking settings, this series has it all. The acting is superb!  You will fall in LOVE these characters and want to be a part of their lives.  The dialog is a thing to behold. <br /> <br />I'd say more but then I'd be here typing and not watching the episodes!
B00005K9QP|4.0|Anyone who loves still the blues and wants to either listen or play the blues must hear this CD.  Eric at his early days with the dirty<br /><br />marshall sound of his stratocaster and John Mayall on piano trying to make the sound sweeter.<br /><br />Some of the classic tunes are recorded here for the first time. And should'nt listen to the sound from these days but from the old days.
B000BJS4TO|4.0|Pleasant, sometimes haunting, especially suited for relaxing or dinner music.  If you want authentic, search out Koto music. <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|there are not too many cd's that i instantly love, but this one hit the jackpot. after all, these are the guys that inspired cold play to bring their best at ACL. such a beautiful, uplifting collection quite unlike anything else. this one earned an immediate spot in my car.......reserved for my top 6 (cause that's all that fits). who else am i playing in my car,  you ask? snow patrol, wolf parade, modest mouse, the killers and steve burns.
B000AL730O|2.0|I had just seen the Paul McCartney tour and was hooked on the melody of Jenny Wren. The problem with this cd is that it is essentially light weight fluff that you will listen to once and put away in your collection. Paul is still wonderful in concert but this cd was a disappointment - the rock doesn't rock, and alot of the material sounds forced and empty.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Once again our Rod Stewart doesn't disappoint--this CD was worth the wait---the music is good, the words are excellent and Rod is everything to everyone---to listen to him is to relax, forget one's troubles and just enjoy a good experience! That's our Irresistible Rod for you--to see in person or to listen to--at home or in the car---we just love him.
B000068FXR|5.0|<br />I purchased the three remastered albums, Breakfast in America, Crime of the Century and Crisis,what crisis?. <br />Each one a classic.

B000BT97AO|5.0|Mirrormask was the movie I wanted to see in the theaters, but which wasn't released widely, so I couldn't. <br /> <br />So I got the DVD so I could watch it. <br /> <br />I liked it, a lot. It's a subtle movie, and I think if you're not already an artist of some kind it might go over your head--but for those who are artists...either visual artists, or writers, or the like...you'll like the little homages to the craft that are scattered through the movie. <br /> <br />Also, the woman who plays Helenor is a very good actress. :)  (And she's actually older than she looks--I thought her between 12 and 14, but she's really 21 or so!) <br /> <br />Really, Mirrormask is a book made faithfully on screen by a writer who understands visual arts. It's a blend of the best of the two--the most creative Visual Art with the most creative Ideas and Writing. You could SEE the things a writer thinks up in the privacy of their own head up there on screen, which doesn't happen often--there are subtle differences between the creative writer and the creative artist, and I think this is the first movie I've ever seen where something similar to my own internal state as a writer has been translated on screen in a visual way. <br /> <br />There are a lot of little jokes in the dialogue and visual art, but they're in-jokes and I think hard to pick up. <br /> <br />But that's ok--the movie will be a good one for re-watching, so you can pick up the subtleties better the second time around. <br /> <br />So, if you're intersted in a film with texture and beauty and creativity and some pretty good acting, pick the DVD up now, and have fun being a kid again (but a sophisticated one!) while watching it.
0345442970|5.0|This book was very well written and overall very enjoyable to read.  It filled in so many of the gaps and questions that I had about Episode 1.  After reading this book, it actually made me want to watch Episode 1 again, which up until this time was not one of my favorite Star Wars movies.  Now I actually enjoy watching it.  I highly recommend this book to any and all Star Wars fans.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|It was amazing to see so many superstars on one stage. It reminded me so much of the Concert for Bangladesh. George's son looks like his twin brother. It is well worth the cost if you like a great DVD with outstanding music. <br /> <br />Jim F <br />NY
6304698542|5.0|'Cabaret' is a wake up call - for the viewer and for the characters . I had a vague idea of the themes of the film , but until I saw it come to life , I realise I didn't fully comprehend . <br /> <br />In a lot of ways , the film is creepy , not only due to the political backstory , but because of the way people interact and the lyrics of the songs they sing .  <br />The songs are educational in a way . <br /> <br />It is a film for grown ups , no doubt about that . <br />The term 'musical' applies to it , but the film is layered for those who wish to dig deeper .  <br />No wonder it is seen as a classic . <br /> <br />Try it , but be warned it is not for those that like their musicals bright and happy .
B0007Y08IS|3.0|Although  some of the spoofing of America's position as the world policeman hits right on, much of the picture is just filthy.  This actually limits the films effectiveness as the target audience is greatly reduced.  To do this without the crutch of so much obscenity would have been the mark of a great piece of work and would have been much more effective and enduring.  As it is, this is merely a period piece that will soon be forgotten.

B000286S8S|5.0|What can I say? The Best of the Best of Van Hallen. I purchased this for my 15 year old nephew to introduce him to what Rock is all about and he loves it. Can't go wrong with this one!
B00005JOFO|4.0|I was expecting some gratuitous gay cowboy flick. The amount of hype Brokeback Mountain received had me shying away. I expected to hate it. I thought I'd be disappointed. I'm a real cynic. I'll admit I actually wanted to hate it because everyone else had raved on so much. <br /> <br />In any event I can't deny that I loved it. Without a doubt it is the most beautifully crafted film I have seen (It's reasonable to say I haven't seen that many good movies). The story is artfully told. Heath Ledger's portrayl of Ennis Del Mar was honest and heart felt. You really saw the torment he put himself through trying to deny his love for Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and present an honest, straight, normal persona to his world. Jake Gyllenhaal had to work even harder to give Jack a confidence in himself and an acceptance of his sexuality that Ennis never had. Although Jack's feelings for Ennis where obvious, the fact that he had other lover's made his character humanly flawed. To the film's credit neither character ever mentions love. The acting and direction is so spectacular that you see all the emotion and unspoken words play across each character as clear as if it was spoon-fed. It so rare to be allowed to understand a film's intent without having it rammed down your throat with over acting, dialogue and special effects. <br /> <br />This isn't a 'sensation' movie, it doesn't set out to be controversial or political or even to set a standard for the gay community. Ignore all of that and see the movie for what it is. A heart-wrenching tale of unspoken love, denial and human struggle for personal acceptance. It's wonderful and deserves all it's praise for being what it is. No apologies, No expectations. It's almost as if they made it thinking that no one would ever see it. The best word for it is 'Honest'.
B00006RAKP|4.0|I thought this was a great price for 2 CD's of greatest hits.  On my CD, one song skips.   But it is not a favorite song so I didn't mind too much.  It did make me wonder if that was why the price was so low, though.
B000BZIST4|5.0|This film comes very close to a documentary due to the camera technique , which helps the viewer feel more part of the story . <br /> <br />The police atmosphere and mundane aspect of the job is relayed well . <br /> <br />I was not in New York in the 70's , but thanks to this film I can imagine what parts of it were like . That just happens to be an interest of mine . <br /> <br />The director goes on about camera technique in rather an egocentric manner in the commentary and in the documentaries , which apart from that aspect , are very interesting in themselves . <br /> <br />Luckily , the whole 2 disc package is extremely good value . <br />Anything with Gene Hackman is worth seeing just for him , I find . <br /> <br />Try this package , as well you will gain an appreciation of not just the film , but also the thought that went into it .
B00005JMUA|3.0|This is definitely not Tarantino's best.  There are some seriously disturbing scenes in this movie involving children and frankly the idea is that all is justified by revenge and by the fact that the protagonist gets her child back.  I cannot help but wonder if this is some kind of post 9/11 self justification movie.  These seem to be getting more common; witness Battlestar Galactica and all of its melodrams, or even War of the Worlds.  Our ethical values of much of the last century are being challenged and not for the better either.  The real crime here however, is that the movie is hackneyed.  The idea that all of the violence and death is justified by revenge and getting the little girl is so old it is pathetic. <br />Nevertheless the movie is visually stunning albeit a sort of diseased Charlies Angels.

B00005JNJV|5.0|This latest Batman flick is much better than previous films.  It has a totally different feel, and seems much more up to date.  The first time I saw it, the movie kept me awake on an overnight flight from the UK!  This film explains so much about the series, and how Batman came to be.  Action packed, great cast, and a little humor built in.. it's well worth checking out.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Great story - beautiful background, highly recommend this to any that enjoy a good \\" period movie!! \\"
B0007TKNL0|5.0|If I could give this 10 stars I would. This movie pulled me in from the beginning and left me in tears at the end. I don't know why in didn't well in the threaters, but I'v almost worn my out.

0767817710|4.0|Without a doubt, this film smacks heavily of the stereotypical Spaghetti westerns of the '60's!! But those were some of my favorites...From the tried and true, good winning out over evil foundation, to the sometimes haunting music scores of Ennio Morricone which helped launch Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone into the spotlight, in my opinion, Director Sam Raimi and Composer Alan Silvestri do an admirial job of picking up where the former left off. Whether this genre is your taste will decide if you really appreciate this work.  <br /> <br />Most of the other reviewers have outlined the story, so I'm not going into it again except to make these remarks. <br /> <br />I must admit, that I missed this film totally for several years, and didn't view it at all until the music score caught my attention one evening as the film was being aired on a cable channel. Silvestri's score put the hook in me and the rest is history. <br /> <br />The principal actors do a splendid job in my book, making this film entertaining. Hackman reminded me of the Capt. Ramsey of Crimson Tide with a pair of six-guns. I have yet to experience Hackman in a bad performance...yes, some better than others, but never bad!! And Sharon Stone...well, what can I say? Whether you think she fit the part or not, I found her to be a pleasure to watch in a setting totally removed from her norm. She obviously believed in this film as she was one of the Producers!  <br />Gladiator star, Russell Crowe, and Titanic's Leonardo DiCaprio complete the cast of well-known names, with performances that kept this film interesting. Lance Henriksen, Kevin Conway and Tobin Bell lend their talents efficiently in supporting roles. <br /> <br />Yes, there are a couple of portions that seem to be a bit cartoonish, as one reviewer put it, but all in all, being a lover of the western genre, I really enjoyed this film, and I can't say enough about how the musical score helped set this film a couple of shelves higher than it would have been without it! These days, a music score can make or break a picture...it's big business! And even though this film was never intended to compete at the Academy Awards, Alan Silvestri did a masterful job in capturing the essence of this film through his music!  <br /> <br />The professional critics are so out of touch with the public it's almost comical. Some of them should go into politics!! Don't listen to the critics on this one...In my view this film was grossly under-rated...But judge for yourself if you're a western buff. This DVD is deserving of a spot in anyone's collection! <br /> <br />I ordered this film from Amazon after trying unsuccessfully for months to find it locally. I received the DVD in about 4 days in excellent condition.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Odd mix of characters, and style, but this movie is great. <br /> <br />As someone who has never seen the original series this movies was based on; you don't need to watch the series to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br />Watched it twice in the theater, and still wanted more.

0780619587|4.0|The loving, but possessive, father's effect on his son is poignant.  The son's genius is recognized, and he is pushed toward realizing it, but simultaneously held back, creating tensions in the son which ultimately lead to a breakdown.  We understand that they are Jewish.  The scene of the father looking over the fence, is at once foreboding of, and reminiscent of, peering through the fence at Auschwitz, or some other Nazi extermination camp.  The son's decision to break away in deciding to pursue training in England, saves him from the Holocaust, but can only increase the guilt feelings that he experiences.  The use of Rakhmaninov's Third Piano Concerto, profoundly comples and beautiful, gives a rich texture to the tapestry of this moving film biography.  Art is redeeming, and after years of breakdown and suffering, the master pianist finds his own salvation, and his ability to accept love.

B000000OF6|5.0|This is one of those albums that gets in your head and you can't get it out!  If you liked Queen in the 70's, you owe it to yourself to buy this set! You'll be singing it night and day.
B000002KCC|5.0|Raw....ragged.....ravaged and rocking....this is certainly Neil's best album, if by 'best' one can say it best expresses his true spirit as an artist and his most characteristic musical idioms. Mournful, bitter, insightful, challenging and yet still compassionate, \\"Tonight's The Night\\" captures a time and a place as well as any album since Marvelous Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On?\\". This would not be the album to start your Neil Young experience if you're not familiar with his work.....for that I would recommend the tandem of the earlier \\"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere\\" and \\"Prairie Wind\\", his latest masterpiece of elegaic moods and fond memories. But for those of us who grew up with him and his music, this is the kick to the gut, the jump-start to the heart, the one that nails his career to the rock 'n roll Wall of Fame. Just listen to \\"Tired Eyes\\", \\"Mellow My Mind\\", \\"Albuquerque\\", \\"Borrowed Tune\\"......and especially the bookend versions of the title cut. Some of his other albums dance to the raucous joy of rock and roll, some others may soothe a melancholy soul, but none of them sing the truth of a troubled heart more eloquently. There's beauty and sadness and fire and tears in these songs. \\"Tonight's The Night\\" will never fade away. For most of us there will always be one of those nights.
0307276902|1.0|I was interested in this book because it was on the Oprah Book Club list - then while it was being delivered - the Smoking Gun.com article came out which I read in it's entirety.  The smoking gun article held my interest far greater then the Million Little Pieces Book.  I have yet to get past the second chapter.  It is a very dull read once you know that it is fiction!!!!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|My family became hooked on the Firefly series on its second run on the Sci-Fi channel. I found the cowboy theme and language contrived at first but once I got through an episode I realized what a rare gem this show was. A magical chemistry ensemble cast with a slow burn unveiling of great sci-fi story to be revealed in the movie Serenity, make this a complete and satisfying series. We keep watching episodes over and over and still we have not gotten tired of any of them. Too bad so many of us missed the first run and we lost the series to short sighted, ratings driven bean counters. Snatch this one up.

B000003CMC|5.0|Their best studio album - period.  End of discussion.  This is the Allman Brothers Band at their 1970s peak.   This album was three sides into a four-sided album (back in the days of vinyl) when Brother Duane died as the result of a motorcycle accident on October 29, 1971.  Having picked up the pieces in the aftermath of Duane Allman's untimely death, the remaining Brothers produced some of their finest work (Melissa, Les Brers in A Minor, Ain't Wastin' Time No More), all of which they still play live today.  Of special note is the playing of bassist Berry Oakley. To fill the sonic hole left by Duane's passing, Brother Berry turns it up more than a notch and plays lead bass, especially on the instrumental Les Brers in A Minor.  His fat bass lines drive the song like a runaway locomotive.  Melissa, Gregg Allman's tribute to his late brother, is probably the finest song he has ever written.  It is one of the very few Allman Brothers songs on which Brother Gregg plays guitar (he also plays piano and Hammond B-3 organ).  On Gregg's Ain't Wastin' Time No More, Brother Dickie Betts emerges from Duane's shadow and turns in a stunning slide performance.  His lead playing on Gregg's Melissa gives the song even more emotional weight.  The three live songs cut during Duane's lifetime (One Way Out, Trouble No More, and Mountain Jam) demonstrate the Allman Brothers' fearlessness and prowess as a live unit.  A fitting tribute to Duane Allman.  A must-have CD.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The album is simply gorgeous....the more I listen to it, the more its subtle brilliance unfolds.....5 stars!
B00005JO9J|4.0|The consummate cast of this television show is exemplary to what other shows are offering. I am not the sort of person to wade through commercials to enjoy a short drama, so watching Grey's Anatomy on DVD is a fantastic alternative. The acting is of movie star caliber. I believe you will be very content when watching this drama. It is extremely enjoyable.

B000003CMD|4.0|With the passing in 1971 of Brother Duane Allman and the addition of keyboardist Chuck Leavell, a change in musical direction for the Allman Brothers Band was a certainly.  Like 1972's Eat a Peach, this album was also recorded under trying circumstances.  Brother Berry Oakley died during the album's sessions on November 11, 1972 from injuries resulting from a motorcycle crash eerily similar to that which took Brother Duane (the two crashes happened just two blocks from each other). It was on this album the Allman Brothers shifted from the blues into a more country-like direction.  This change began, ironically enough, with Dickey Betts' \\"Blue Sky\\" from \\"Eat a Peach,\\" and continued with the hit \\"Ramblin' Man,\\" also a Dickey Betts tune.  Of the seven songs on \\"Brothers and Sisters,\\" four of them are Dickey's (including \\"Southbound\\", Pony Boy,\\" and the instrumental \\"Jessica.\\")  Throw in Brother Gregg's \\"Wasted Words,\\" \\"Come & Go Blues,\\" and \\"Jelly Jelly,\\" you have a certified Allman Brothers classic.  One can only wonder how good this album would have been had Brother Gregg not recorded his solo debut \\"Laid Back\\" at the same time the Brothers were cutting \\"Brothers and Sisters.\\"  Another must-have CD.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie, you'll feel the same for the soundtrack. Nicole Kidman has a beautiful voice and does not disappoint. The blend of old songs with new is truly enjoyable to those of us who heard them all in their day.
6304806434|5.0|I received the order within four days in perfect condition. As has been the case with all of my orders from Amazon , I was pleased with their \\"five star service\\".
6305076995|1.0|The sound is horrible. The song selection is just as bad.The only highlight is Steve Howe doing THE CLAP, and its just \\"allright\\". I confess that I'm not a huge YES fan, but I was looking for some Steve Howe highlights. He is unfortunately overshadowed by the rest of the pityful group. I would hope that YES has another DVD out there somewhere, because this one just doesnt deliver.
B0000028RR|5.0|I would have to rate this as their best album so far. Every song is great, it's like putting on Zeppelin 2.
B000002H3E|5.0|Excellent example of 80's metal. Don Dokken's vocals shine on this cd and George Lynch's guitar work is by far some of his best. This whole cd rocks. I love all of the tracks, but a few that really stick out are: The Hunter, In My Dreams, Lightnin' Strikes Again, & It's Not Love. A must have for any 80's metal fan. You won't be let down by purchasing this one!!
B000BNI90O|5.0|If you were a big fan of the movies and accompanying score this is the version of the soundtrack to get even though it is a bit pricey it is well worth it as you are getting the complete soundtrack to the movie. Everything included. Hear the movie as it was meant to be from start to finish. Excellent score.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I received this item within four days of placing the order. As usual I was pleased with the prompt service and the quality of merchandise which I received.
B00006IR5S|5.0|If you liked the movie, you will LOVE the sound track.  I listen to it at work all day and the music takes you back to the wonderful sites in the movie. <br /> <br />Very inspiring and relaxing at the same time.  I have ALL the sound tracks to ALL the movies, this one has the longest of the Harry Potter Themes ... \\"Harry's Wonderous World\\"  Takes you right back into the movie. <br /> <br />Highly suggested for ANY Harry Potter fan, young or old.
6304936303|4.0|If you're looking for over-the-top action and are the sort that can sit down and enjoy a movie without overanalyzing it, this one's for you. Some movies you can pick at all the plot holes and inconsistencies, but if you want an action movie that's loaded full of action plus some obligatory dry humor, you can't go wrong with The Last Boy Scout. Fans of Bruce Willis shouldn't miss this movie either. Willis plays an alcoholic detective who recieves a call from a colleague of his to do surveillance for an exotic dancer named Cory (played by Halle Berry). But when Cory gets killed in a professional hit right in front of her boyfriend (played by Wayans) and the detective, the 2 team up to figure out why she was killed and of course, in true action film style, there is much more than meets the eye.  <br /> <br />It's fast-paced and exciting and provides plenty of laughs. The Amazon reviewer said something to the effect of that this movie shows great contempt for women and I just didn't get that from this flick. Maybe I was just too mesmerized with Bruce Willis, but whatever the case, The Last Boy Scout will entertain you down to the very last second.
B000002IJO|5.0|What can I say?? My 2nd favorite band of all time. I was fortunate enough to catch these guys in concert 3 times. Ratt consisted of five of the most talented musicians of that era in my opinion. Warren DeMartini is still my favorite guitarist to date. I won't bother listing any songs because this whole cd is awesome. All I can say is: \\"buy it\\", \\"buy it\\", \\"buy it\\".
B000BJS4TO|4.0|The soundtrack really enhanced my experience watching Memoirs. So I naturally wanted the cd to this beautiful soundtack. It is not trademark John Williams sound. You can tell he came from a different place creatively with this soundtrack. It will immediately tranport you far east and with traditional sounds of flutes and beautiful sweet & whisping music. It is very relaxing to listen to but never dull that you will fall asleep. Anyone looking for traditional Asian instrumental music look no further whether you liked the movie or not.
B000BJS4F8|3.0|I have her other albums and was a little disappointed that there were only a couple new songs.  The rest were just copies from previous works.
B000002UAR|5.0|In recent years I have become just as obsessed with the beatles as the numberless fans of one of the greatest bands of all time. But the first full album i listened to by them is still my favorite. That album is Revolver. Before I listened to this album I thought of them only as a group of sing-a-long pop songwriters. Oh but was I surprised when I found this album to be nothing short of inspiring <br /> <br />Taxman unfortunately almost made me turn the album off. It isn't necesarily a bad song, but it was precisely what i was expecting of them, which is usually disappointing. And thats when Eleanor Rigby came on. It seemed familiar, because I mean honestly who has never heard this song, but I was taken aback by the wonderful strings and the amazing harmonizing throughout the entire song. Then came the dreamy pop song, I'm Only Sleeping, with a certain British drawl behind all of the singing, it is perfectly sublime. And then disappointment set back in. I LOATHE yellow submarine. I apologize to all who think it is fun and quirky and lighthearted. It doesn't make me feel lighthearted, it makes me feel angry that I am listening to it. It is possible that if I hadn't heard it after the one-two gorgeous punch of the last two songs that I would have liked yellow submarine. But it is probably my least favorite beatles song ever. So usually this song is then skipped.  <br /> <br />The other tryly notable and legendary songs for me are Here, There, Everywhere, which is another dreamy song; Love You To, kind of a psychadelic masterpiece; For No One, which is a mournful song of feeling forgotten and useless to the one you love; and Got To Get You Into My Life and Tomorrows Never Knows, two of the best rock songs that the Beatles ever put out <br /> <br />This album is, in a word, legendary. Many people actually consider it as THE masterpiece. While I would have to disagree on its status as the greatest album ever, I agree wholeheartedly in the genius of the songwriting, melodies, and especially the variation of genres that the Beatles were able to master. I may not be one of those people who worship the land that a Beatle may have walked on, but i can certainly attest to the genius that this album is. definitely check it out if you wanna hear more than just their #1 songs
6305212112|5.0|I hate tomatoes, but the movie Fried Green Tomatoes is a favorite in my collection. My dad had it on VHS years ago and I've always loved the story, which boils down to loving yourself and not letting others walk all over you. <br /> <br />Kathy Bates plays a married woman who's marriage is stuck in a rut. She gets what she needs when she least expects it while accompanying her husband to the hospital where they visit his aunt, who hates her and throws things at her so she's forced to sit in the waiting room. That's when she meets a kind, elderly woman who begins to tell her about her life when she was young. Bates is intrigued by this woman's story and is quite delighted to run into the older woman again during the next visit to her husband's aunt. Eventually, the 2 become friends and through her stories of her youth, the older woman gives Bates the courage to assert herself and love herself.  <br /> <br />This movie will make you laugh as much as it will make you cry, but in the end you'll feel enlightened and want to scream \\"Towanda\\" out your front door. Outstanding script & acting. Don't miss it.

B00005JKNF|5.0|Robert Altman is one of the absolute Direction Masters all over the world. His ironic visions reminds inexorably to Jonathan Swift. His impeccable narrative style, that wonderful movements of camera, the discretely sumptuous stage, the fabulous illumination, the acid handle of the script, the prodigious domain of the British mood, the polish and refined cynicism beneath some lines, and obviously the special care of selection of every one of the characters make of this film an absolute artistic feat.<br /><br />The movie follows the great tradition of Agatha Christie ` novels. Altman takes all the time of the world to show every  one of the personages, their affections and emotive lacks are depicted with unerring clarity. The theatrical mood reveals his deep love for this artistic expression. You can realize how the camera keeps always at a discrete distance from the viewer. All of you know the efficacy to use the staircase as dramatic device and natural frontier between the well defined social classes. This will be precisely the accurate place in which we will tie clues, being able to listen the most hidden thoughts, desires or sudden dates.<br /><br />It is a superb chamber work, an immense Adagio where all of us must participate in this smart game of shadowy complicities, those little details that progressively will be enhancing the whole canvas.<br /><br />Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Emily Watson and Cliff Owen are fabulous in superlative grade. Because all the cast was splendid too. The zealous search of the artistic direction shines along the film.<br /><br />There is not any detail to reject. This is a towering, egregious and majuscule film and from its immediate release, a new classic. Altman belongs to a reduced category of  out of this world filmmakers, and this work still confirms it, in case there was any person who seriously doubt it.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Mulan in many ways is probably one of the better ones that Disney made before making some really subpar fluff. Pocahontas was disappointing and Hercules was a bit too light-hearted to be taken seriously. Even with comic relief, Mulan wants to be taken seriously too and that's why it works. Not a classic really but still well made. <br /> <br />Film's set in China with Mulan trying to impress the matchmaker to find a husband. Only things don't go so well, and things get worse when Mulan's ailing father is called into war with the Huns. Not wanting to risk her father's life, Mulan takes his armor and sword and rides off. Her family guardians don't want her to leave so they summon a dragon, only they get Mushu instead, a very tiny lizard-like wisecracker. Along for the ride is Cri-Kee, a lucky bug, to help save the Emperor. <br /> <br />Disney was heavily starting to use CG more often and combining traditional animation and it's still impressive to see. Each Disney release usually has that one big action scene or animation showcase: the dance in Beauty and the Beast, stampede in Lion King and the Hydra fight in Hercules. Here we get an avalanche and it still looks cool. My only problem is there's not really enough wide shots, we're very close to it and would've been nice to see all of it. <br /> <br />Eddie Murphy in many ways is like a more tolerable Robin Williams. They're both very manic and hyperactive comedic wise but Eddie's not as energetic, which is why Mushu works, he knows how to dial it down. The rest of the cast is quite good, including Ming-Wa, known from the Joy Luck Club and ER. The other cast you probably wouldn't recognize since it's not huge like James Woods or Mel Gibson, which works just fine. <br /> <br />One thing that doesn't work with the film is the songs. There's nary a Circle of Life or Never Had a Friend Like Me in the entire thing. They're not really all that memorable and there's a certain predictableness to the structure of them. At leastHakuna Matata was different to Be Prepared just as Be Our Guest was different to Gaston. Here, you're almost unsure whether it's even different songs and you'd have to think \\"well it does sound a bit different\\". <br /> <br />Mulan probably won't enter the Disney classic catalogue like Lion King or Bambi but it's still one of their better made ones. <br />

0525948023|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me, knowing that I was a fan of The Power of Now.  I read other review's here indicating that it was a 'repeat' of Tolle's other book.  I thought it was quite different; and therefore, don't agree.   <br /> <br />A New Earth starts off with a bang and then (in my personal perspective) seemed to loose it's punch just before the chapters on (what he calls) The Pain Body.  Those chapters were brilliant in presentation, in my humble opinion. <br /> <br />I have recommended this book to many of my clients and give it lots of points.  If you want to understand your self, others and life in general, its THE book to read! <br /> <br />These are my thoughts and I give it a 5+. <br /> <br />Joy Star
B000002KO1|5.0|I love this album and I love this band. Everything is just right; the songs, the voice, the sound and the people. I have all their albums, but this is still my favorite. The energy on songs like Mystery Achievement and Precious is just right there. The Pretenders' debut album was a fantastic and influential CD when it came out in 1980. More than 25 years later you can hear their influence on so many other acts from Melissa Etheridge to the Cranberries to Smoke Ring Days to Sheryl Crow and dozens of others. I like all the versions of The Pretenders, but I am a little partial to this one with HoneyMan and Pete. Every song on this album is a winner. If you don't have this CD, get it, you will be glad you did.
B0000TB050|5.0|U2 has been a personal favorite of mine for many years.  This is the first time I've seen a performance in/from Ireland.  U2 was clearly enjoying the night with the fans that have loved them since the beginning.  A Time magazine writer once wrote that a U2 concert was part rock show and part religeous experience.  This DVD captures that feeling much like the Red Rocks video did.  However, unlike Red Rocks which was dominated by U2's humanist, often angry perspective, Slane Castle captures U2's uplifting, contemporary blend of humanism, humor, & political activism.  Life is challenging these days, and this DVD provides a brief respite while subtly reminding the viewer of the scope of humanity.  Only U2 could do both!  My only criticism is that the DVD is only 2 hours long, not 2 days!
B000AP04OM|5.0|I  give this movie 5  stars it  is very  good.  If u are looking  for a musical with  fun and adventure this is the one.
0307276902|5.0|As much as the author wasn't 100% truthful in his recollection of his rehab experience, the book is still a good read. If you can look past the fabrications and take the book for what it should be, a story about somebody who was literally killing themselves with drug use, and how they were able to get back on track. Great read, and I look forward to James Frey's next book, My Friend Leonard.
0974153001|5.0|I found this book to be one of best primers in polymer clay figure sculpting available.  Need to know how to make hands?  Feet?  Armature?  Easy to follow, great pictures, exactly what I was looking for in my quest for books on figure sculpting.  A necessity for the library of a \\"home-crafter\\" polymer fan.
B00009P1O0|5.0|What can you say that hasnt been said before?! I dont think it matters if you are already a Neil Young fan, you should definitely get this album. Its somewhat bemusing that the typical way into young is Harvest or After the goldrush. For me this is Young at his very best. More importantly unlike you would expect for a fan-favourite this is also Young at his most accessible. Start to finish this record impresses. Most of all, this record features the stunning 'Ambulance Blues'. This might be my favourite track of all time by anybody...Its absolutely beautiful. So buy this record!
B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie is for anyone who's been hurt so bad by love that they'd be willing to do anything to make the pain stop... including removing that person completely from your memory.  Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are amazing on screen together in this not-so-normal romantic comedy.  I was actually a little skeptical about watching this the first time, but the second I did I rushed over here to Amazon and bought it.  You really do have to see this movie to believe it.
B00004SVID|5.0|If you are a huge Floyd fan - particularly of the Original Studio version of The Wall, then this is a must purchase.  The songs here are true to their studio version counterpart.   I just hate it when a \\"live\\" version of a song is nearly unrecognizable from the original.   <br />This live version of The Wall is almost too similar to the studio version, that is why I recomend it for hard core fans only.  I have listend to The Wall at least once a month since it was released over 20 years ago.  I think it is one of the most briliant albums ever made.  If you think the original Wall is one of the top 20 albums of all time, you will not be disappointed with this live version.   It is the closest we will ever get to seeing it live, since Roger and the boys refuse to reunite.
0553062182|4.0|This book is not only relevant for people who live their lives as Highly Sensitive Persons but for those who find themselves HSP's after a stay in hospital, a round of chemotherapy, or some other circumstance that makes the world a more awesome place.

B0007CNXUK|5.0|It's a total chick flick, but who can resist Johnny Depp.  It's a movie I can watch over and over again.  This movie helps you escape from all stress and reality in life if only for two hours.  A must own in your DVD collection.
038572179X|5.0|Atonement was assigned reading this semester in my contemporary fiction class and, for once, every single person in class fell in love with it.  I've NEVER seen overeducated lit students and good genuine people unite like that.  On the Touchingly Surreal scale, it was like the Christmas Truce or something.  This book is so sweet and tender, and frustrating -- it was very difficult not to invest a lot of emotion in it.  Some moments between Robbie and Cecelia, and others in Briony's thoughts, still knock me completely out. <br /> <br />~~One of the quintessential good reads~~
B00001P4RI|4.0|Well, I must first tell you that I am a huge DCD fan and have been for many, many years.  With that said, I feel that this album does not reach the standard already set by DCD.  I realize this is a solo project and may not be meant to even resemble DCD.  I think it is safe to say however, that Brendan was shooting for the same style.  Please don't take me wrong though... I do love the album and there a couple of songs that I would never want to be without.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw SERENITY before seeing this series. The film made enough sense so that seeing FIREFLY is not necessary, but anyone who goes that route is missing out. <br /> <br />FIREFLY is possibly the most misunderstood series - at least by certain tv execs - in television history! Joss Whedon's best work by far is to combine science fiction with certain western elements. It follows the adventures of Captain Malcolm Reynolds, a former soldier on the losing side of a galactic war, trying to get by pulling small smuggling and stealing jobs with his crew of misfits. First mate Zoe was in the war under Mals command and remains loyal. Pilot Wash is childish, good humoured and smart. Kaylee is the hippy mechanic and Jayne is the tag-along tough guy. All brawn, zero brain. In the pilot episode, they pick up a few passengers. Some are up to no good and some become part of the crew. Book, a shepherd (priest), Inara, a Companion (VERY high class prostitute) and Simon Tam and his sister River. Both are marked Alliance fugitives and to say the absolute least, River is a few sandwiches short of a buffet! <br /> <br />There is nothing slow about this series at all. It grabs you by the throat and drags you along without letting go. Nathan Fillion has given the world the new Han Solo in Captain Malcolm Reynolds and the rest of the cast are equally as good. <br /> <br />My advice: Buy this immediately. If it takes you, remember that it was fan power that gave us SERENITY. Join the Browncoats! <br /> <br />10/10
B00005M989|5.0|I love this CD, it has all the great classic songs that everybody knows and loves. I don't really care for the newer stuff, like Alphabet Street. I got this album for the fun 80s tracks. It leaves me wanting more of his 80's work. I'm going to track down the album Purple Rain and 1999. If you want a good introduction to Prince, get this album, it rocks!
0634060384|2.0|It's about time someone attempted to publish a 'legal' version of the 'illegal' Real Book, the standard text that virtually all jazz musicians use to enable them to play together.  But it's  unfortunate that Hal Leonard was the company to do it, because they still have not gotten it right.  For those that don't know, rumour has it that the original Real Book (editions 1 thru 5) were originally created by music students at the legendary Berklee School Of Music, who began transcribing the heads (melodies)and chord progressions of the jazz standards that they most often played and binding them into a book that they xeroxed and shared amongst each other.  The only problem is that they never got permission from the composers/publishers of the music and consequently never paid any royalties to said composers/publishers. <br /> <br />When comparing the 'illegal' 5th edition of the Real Book to the new 'legal' 6th edition, the first thing you notice is that several songs are missing from Hal Leonard's 6th edition.  I assume that's because Leonard & Co. was not able to get the rights for some songs, or couldn't get them at a rate that would still allow them to achieve the profit margin they were shooting for.  Though disappointing, that's perfectly understandable.   <br /> <br />However, what I can't understand is why they decided to publish several songs in different keys than they were originally presented in the 5th edition.  Yes, John Coltrane originally recorded \\"Equinox\\" in the key of concert C#, but for years it's been played by what what must be millions of jazz players the world over in the key of C, as it appeared in the original Real Book.  Instead of following what the 5th edition did, Leonard chose to publish it in C# in the new 6th edition.  Though I'm sure more and more people will eventually buy this new 'legal' version, it doesn't change the fact that millions of people still own the old book and therefore countless numbers of people will continue to want toplay it in the 5th edition key, either by reading or from memory.  So why change the key, making the legal and illegal books incompatible?  Or, if your sense of order compels you to publish the originally recorded C# key, why not include a second version in the 5th edition key of C, so that everyone has a choice and can be on the same page? <br /> <br />One of the things that people have always complained about regarding the illegal 5th edition (and those that preceeded it) is that the sheets are full of notation errors.  Some have been corrected through the years, but the number of errors still abound.  The musicians usually hand correct them themselves as they come across them, or just remember where the errors are and adjust accordingly.  One of the exciting things about Leonard's legal version it that it advertised that it was completely accurate, correcting all the prior errors.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  I'm sure there are corrections that have been made, but the Hal Leonard version is still full of errors, and it's both appalling and completely unacceptable for a company as large and sophisticated as Hal Leonoard Publishing to have released such shoddy work.  They didn't even insure that all the songs are correctly arranged alphabetically in the book! <br /> <br />Having said all that, there are three things that Hal Leonard's new 6th edition has going for it: <br />1 - It's cheaper than the illegal version, which usually run about $35.00 each.  Amazon sells the concert key version for less than $20.00. <br />2 - The type is clearer and just a bit easier to read. <br />3 - Last but most importantly, the composers of these great tunes are actually getting paid, as they should be. <br /> <br />It can be argued that reason 3 (paying the composers) is more than enough reason to buy this version over the illegal version, and I have to agree with that, but be that as it may, it's still quite saddening that, after waiting all this time for a companyto publish a legal version of this legendary text, they still couldn't do a competent job.
0201626632|4.0|I'm a new Ph.D. student, and I was strongly encouraged to read this book by a professor I had as an undergrad.  It was worth it.  Read it in one afternoon, but felt like I had gained 25 years worth of wisdom.  It talks about the non-technical aspects of how to succeed after obtaining a Ph.D. in the sciences--conference talks, advisor choices, road to tenure, paper publishing, interviewing, etc.  Much of the advice he gives was on topics I never considered, and it opened my eyes to how (as the title says) simply obtaining a Ph.D will not be enough to ensure a successful career.
1594200653|3.0|Agree with all of the evaluations listed below.  Reading this book is a commitment.  The author goes to great lengths to give you multiple perspectives of this very important and intense period.  Great piece of historical journalism and incredibly thorough.  However I have a problem when he gets to the end of the book and starts turning the attitude towards the US.  Believe me I'm fully on board with the idea that American imports like EuroDisney have led, to a degree, to cultural insecurity (as he mentions on page 789).  However, I also believe the author comes at this issue from a misguided perspective.  On page 789 he quotes an Italian political figure who stated \\"I hope I won't be thought to be justifying Fascism if I wonder whether with the American landings Europe didn't lose a part of her cultural identity.\\" <br />What would have been lost if America hadn't landed on D-Day or intervened in the Balkans?  Also, he comments on page 792-793 that, on average, Americans take less vacation than Europeans yet Europeans live better lives (despite earning less and paying higher taxes).  I'm not sure the out-of-work coal miner in the north of England would completely agree with the author.  Also, near the end of the book he continually cites how outside of the UK the poverty in Europe was relatively modest.  Throughout the rest of the book he goes to great lengths to demonstrate the disparity of income within Europe on country, regional, and continental levels. <br /> <br />This was a great read for me until I got to the end of the book.  It seems the author couldn't come to an objective conclusion and instead chose to take the easy route and blame the Americans.
1591396190|4.0|The book offers at the end of each chapter questions that can guide the reader to put the concepts into use right away.  This is an excellent feature since it can be used and applied repeatedly.  If a question is not clear, you can always refer to the chapter at issue.  The book overall was a great read!
B0000029DD|5.0|This music is so good it makes me want to die in a thoroughly indescribable way. That anyone could dislike it is unbelievable. It can only be explained by utter incompetence, mental disorder, or that the person was listening with the dull and compassionless part of their brain. You have to open yourself to the music as a free and living, breathing thing.  <br /> <br />When I first heard this album my favorite track was \\"So Real\\" because of it's thick pounding rhythm, twinkling guitar and bold cooing vocals. But when I got into it I quickly disolved into the masterpiece that is \\"Grace\\". There is not a single track I would skip, or in fact even dare to pause. Many nights I sat in a daze just listening from the first sighing \\"oooo\\"s of Mojo pin to the melancholic appeals of \\"Dream Brother. This album was a religion for me as it became for those around me.  <br /> <br />Some of my very favorites are \\"Lover, You Should Have Come Over\\" is an aching ballad of desire and regret that bathes you richly in the honey that is Jeff Buckley's voice, \\"Eternal Life\\" with it's angry growling indignation that enflames your passion, \\"Last Goodbye\\" is a bitter sweet sigh of resignation.  <br /> <br />If you were led to this album by \\"Hallelujah\\" I have found that you will not find what you are looking for. But if you can listen with the inner core of your being you just might fall into the deepest musical experience of your life. <br /> <br />And also JEFF BUCKLEY IS GOD!!!!!!

B0009UC81A|4.0|How can anyone not love the Blues Brothers?  Its been over 20 years since seeing this movie and by todays standards it could be considered a bit hokey, but a great trip and lots of fun.  What can I say, this is one of the all time favorite \\"guy's\\" cult films, right up there with Animal House.  A must for your video library.
B000001FI7|5.0|This album, by far, is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard.  The music is so different than any other.  This is there greatest album.  I highly recommend.

B00006RINF|4.0|The Italian band Lacuna Coil (meaning Empty Spiral) is one of those missed musical gems. For those who miss the old Progressive Rock and are tired of brainless metal, check out this band. Their tracks \\"Swamped\\" and \\"Heaven's A Lie\\" will give you an excellent sense of what they have to offer.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|First off, anyone who calls Death Cab For Cutie sellouts with Plans (their major label debut on Atlantic Records) might want to take a look at the guide I wrote on the subject. I wasn't as thrilled as everyone else was with that Postal Service album, but fortunately frontman Ben Gibbard penned some much better works for THIS album.<br /><br />I personally don't think the band has strayed away from their sound at all. It's a good thing, too, because that makes it easy to pick out highlights like \\"Soul Meets Body\\" (which sounds a little like R.E.M.'s \\"Losing My Religion\\"), \\"Summer Skin\\" and \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\". And I wasn't too impressed by their latest single, \\"Crooked Teeth\\", when they did it on Saturday Night Live, but now it's my favorite song on the album.<br /><br />Introspective tracks are also good, like \\"Someday You Will Be Loved\\" and especially \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\". In fact, if there was ANYthing negative to say about this album, it would be that \\"What Sarah Said\\" made me a little uncomfortable for some reason (but I have just recently lost my grandmother, so maybe THAT'S it). At any rate, great music is what this is, so you should make plans to pick up Plans.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B00025ETIW|5.0|I really like these guys.  Somewhow, though the songs have a somewhat \\"down-trodden\\" theme, they always make me smile.  Perhaps it's because of their sheer energy. <br /> <br />\\"Helena\\" is probably my favorite track on the CD.  It was my first MCR song.  Other favorites are \\"The Jestset Life is Gonna Kill You\\" and \\"You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison.\\" <br /> <br />The song itself is incredibly energetic and fun, and once you get a hold on what the lyrics are actually saying (the cover jacket of the CD has all the lyrics inside it, by the way), it just makes it even more amazing, because of the meanings behind the songs. <br /> <br />All in all, a fabulous album, I can't wait for the next!
B000B73GYE|5.0|The ultimate argument of \\"Batman Begins\\" is that Batman is really more like Superman than we have suspected. The two DC comic book superheroes have always been like night and day, with Batman prowling Gotham City at night relying on only his finely honed human abilities while Superman uses his superpowers for truth, justice, and the American way. But one of the things that made Superman unique was that he really is Superman, the strange visitor from another planet: he pretends to be Clark Kent. \\"Batman Begins\\" argues that the same thing applies to Batman. His name might be Bruce Wayne, but the billionaire the world sees is just a construct. Batman is his true face.<br /><br />Batman is a psychotic and in this 2005 film we find out why. Before his parents were murdered young Master Wayne had a fateful encounter with a whole bunch of bats, and the two events actually end up being related, which makes the death of his parents even more tragic. Despite the protestations of the loyal Alfred, Bruce Wayne knows it is his fault. But while becoming a crime fighter is inevitable there is still a choice as to how that war will be waged, which means traveling halfway around the world to be mentored and trained.. Then he must return to Gotham City and transform himself into a creature of the night whose very appearance will terrorize the criminals and supply himself with the gadgets that will give him a fighting chance on the streets. However, Gotham is being threatened by more than its ruling crime lord and the stakes are higher than our hero knows.<br /><br />The problem is that I hate the frantic pace of film editing in action films like \\"Batman Begins.\\" I am not overly enamored of hand held camera work either, but it is constant cutting in contemporary montage that is driving me crazy. When I go to a theater to see a movie I would like to actually see what is going on and not have to wait until the DVD comes out to slow things down to really see what is going on. This approach to editing did not start with \\"Batman Begins,\\" but since I was looking forward to this cinematic retelling of the origin of the Dark Knight it was particularly bothersome. Every time Batman starts fighting the images are on the screen long enough that I can tell it is a new shot but then we are on to the next one while I try to make sense of the jumbled images of these fight scenes.<br /><br />Maybe the key reason why \\"Spider-Man 2\\" remains the best comic book movie to date is because since the tentacles of Doctor Octopus had to be computer generated Spider-Man was be as well in their big fight scenes. There is not a sequences as good in \\"Batman Returns\\" as the one where Spidey and Doc Ock battle on the side of the building in \\"Spider-Man 2,\\" mainly because there is not a single shot in the action sequences of this new film even half as long as that one. Meanwhile there are lots of martial arts films in which we managed to see what is happening during their big fight sequences, so how come we cannot do the same thing in this Batman movie? When Batman fights I want to see what he is doing flip through shots like I was flipping through the pages of an issue of a \\"Batman\\" comic book. It is maddening.<br /><br />The big irony is that usually movies about comic book superheroes sacrifice story to action, but that is not the case with this screenplay, co-written by director Christopher Nolan and writer David S. Goyer (based on characters created by Bob Kane, but with obvious nods to Frank Miller's work, especially \\"Batman: Year One\\"). Originally the story was quite simple: young Bruce Wayne sees his parents gunned down by a robber. He builds up his body, studies science and decides to become a masked vigilante, taking as his inspiration a bat that flies against a window of Wayne Manor. Noland and Goyer provide more depth to the origin, which adds to the depth of the character as well, which is why I rounded up on this one in the end. The only real flaw in their scriptis an over reliance on the screenwriting trick of doubling up on dialogue (if a line is good once maybe it will be even better a second time). That is why when people talk about their favorite bits in this film they will probably be talking about one-liners (virtually every scene has one) and not any particular action sequence or specific gag.<br /><br />Few will be surprised that Christian Bale has no problems playing the Dark Knight, and a supporting cast that offers by Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman is pretty impressive for a comic book movie. It is too bad that Katie Holmes is not only 16 years younger than the youngest in that bunch because she seems like a kid and not an Assistant D.A. with a death wish, and there is no reason for her to be around for the next one given her benedictory speech. Besides, if Batman works even more closely with Lieutenant Gordon to catch the Joker in the next movie, that would be fine with me. The bottom line here is that while I have no problem with the idea this is the best Batman movie to date, the action sequences were not as good as the other parts of the movie and they should have been in order to move \\"Batman Begins\\" from being very good to being truly great.heir script is an over reliance on the screenwriting trick of doubling up on dialogue (if a line is good once maybe it will be even better a second time).

B0006L16N8|5.0|So Coldplay's past albums: Parachutes, A Rush of the Blood to the Head, ect...were all great. But this is just fantastic! Let's start out with track 1. <br /> <br />Square One: This number starts out slow, but surprises you when it comes out with a compelling melody, and interesting lyrics. The vocals and band are amazing in this song.  <br /> <br />What If: Probably my least favorite song on the album. Even though it is still good, I don't like the continuing lyric of What If...simply because to me What If is a phrase that causes alot of anxiety, and hoplessness.  <br /> <br /> <br />White Shadows: This one has a playful tone, and the lyrics are neat. I love the electric guitar in this song especially. <br /> <br />Fix You: Wow, such an amazing song. The lyrics speak of sorrow, but then end in hope. The instruments are absolutly beautiful. <br /> <br />Talk: Makes me laugh sometimes, but I love it so much anyway. <br /> <br />X&Y: Love it. <br /> <br />Speed Of Sound: The best track on the cd. This song got the most publicity and it deserved it. A song like this is just inspiring. <br /> <br /> <br />A Message: Well A message has a great...message! Lovely song. <br /> <br /> <br />Low: Faster and more rock like when compared to their other songs. Chris doesn't have to sing so high in this one, which I miss but I'm sure it was a great chance to relax his voice. Don't get me wrong though, he sounds great no matter what. <br /> <br /> <br />Hardest Part: This one is alot different from any other Coldplay song, it almost had a little bit of country in the beginning. Great one. <br /> <br /> <br />Swallowed in the Sea: Such a sweet song. The lyrics are so nice, and the melody is simple and amazing. <br /> <br /> <br />Twisted Logic: LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! <br /> <br />
B00005JMX6|4.0|it's a good movie, with comedy, not to serious, good plot, with a bit of a twist at the end. It's well acted, and enjoyable to watch. The movie was better than I expected.
B000EGFVQS|4.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Seebold is one of those books that you just can't put down. It jumps back and forth from one character to another and the fact that the main character Susie is dead and looking down from heaven telling her story is a brilliant way of portraying this tale. Although this book is fictional, it almost seems real. The book tells the tale of how death affects not only family but also those in a community. When tragedy strikes, you can either fall apart or come together. This book is one for the books, i recommend it to women ages 14 and up.  <br /> <br />  Susie Salmon was just a regular teenage girl. She was not the most popular but her beauty struck boys her age and once caught the eye of her seclusive neighbor, Mr. Harvey. One night Susie was walking home from school and she ran into Mr. Harvey in the cornfield close to her home, he told her he wanted to show her something, a hole in the ground. There, he forced her down and killed and raped her. This was the beginning of her story. The book goes on to show the relationships she had with her family and members of the community. She tells the story of her life-after-death and looks down from heaven and tells the story of her family. Her brother, sister, mother and father all greive her death in different ways. Eventually, her mother cant take it anymore and moves to California but when her father suffers a heart attack, her mother comes back to be by his side. A girl named Ruth is touched accidentally by susie on her way to heaven and from then on she had a pre-occupation with susie and her death. Ruth and susies childhood crush Ray come close to finding how and why susie was killed and susie comes back to fufill her dream of kissing Ray through Ruth. Later, susie leaves her family to let them not forget but not be obsessed with her death any longer. Everyone comes to be happy and always remember Susie Salmon.
B00005JNRE|5.0|I saw Nanny McPhee last night, and I have to say that she most definitely gives Mary Poppins a run for her money! <br /> <br />As a \\"big kid\\" movie-goer who was already familiar with many of the actors, I found Nanny McPhee to be a real treat. Emma Thompson is amazing as usual. When I went to see the movie, I knew that Angela Lansbury was in it, but it took me a while to recognize her and it wasn't just because of the nose. I think this is the first movie where she's played a not-nice character, but she was . . . wow!
B0002V7ODI|5.0|I'm an admitted comic geek.  Loved this movie.  The first time I saw it, thought it was really good.  Then watched it again.  Loved it more.  Again.  Ditto.  With so much garbage now being put out by Hollywood (do we really need anymore remakes?) its so refreshing to see something so well made, especially a comic book-based film.  Ron Perlman was perfectly cast - his sarcastic one liners are wonderful.  I finally saw the extended version last night.  What a difference.  Its even better.  Goes far more in depth into the characters.  Wonderful.  The theatrical release is great, but the extended release is outstanding.
0792843584|5.0|Fantastic movie.  I really enjoyed seeing it again.  The only bad thing about the movie is that it was released 5 days after Star Wars.
B000BJS4OY|2.0|The cd is 5 stars.<br /><br />The concert dvd is 3 stars: good but not as the great Bruce Springsteen's standard.<br /><br />The documentary dvd is 1 star because of one reason: this edition doesn't have subtitles for not english language people. I think it's a shame to Sony-BMG
B0000025DI|3.0|<br />This album is NOT a five-star masterpiece, nor is it the certified disaster some proclaim. It rounds out Dylan's brief gypsy period (Tarot cards, facial stubble, bandanas, etc.) and offers some rich musical tapestry on \\"Changing of the Guards,\\" \\"Senor\\" and \\"Where are You Tonight (Journey Through Dark Heat)\\" Great subtitle on that last one cause that's what listening to this album is like - a journey through dark heat. The production is muddy; the lyrics are inpenetrable, even by Dylan standards. And the gospel background singers will probably annoy you as they echo each verse (\\"the keys as they clink....\\") But if you can get past the clunkers that populate the middle of this record there is a nice mood sustained here. Plus \\"New Pony\\" is pretty cool, no matter what anyone says. Don't be too hard on Dylan for this spotty work - this was not a good time in his life. For some reason, I just like \\"Street Legal.\\"
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Quite possibly the movie of the year.<br /><br />I went into this thinking, \\"They've DONE the whole Batman thing. Why put us through it AGAIN?! The first Burton/Keaton Batman was da bomb. \\"Returns\\" was decent, \\"Forever\\" was entertaining but sadly lacking. Seriously, with a cast like Drew Barrymore, Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones, Nicole Kidman, Val Kilmer, and Kevin Grevioux (Raze of Underworld fame), how could Schumacher screw that up? Well, he found a way, and with the release of \\"Batman & Robin,\\" it became painfully obvious that the end of Batman was more than just \\"in sight,\\" it was here.<br /><br />I grieved the death of what could have been a terriffic franchise, and I moved on.<br /><br />Then along comes Goyer. He wrote \\"Blade: Trinity,\\" and while I am NO fan of that movie, we'll blame the studio's cut and Parker Posey's horrible acting...for now. I will give him the benefit of the doubt because he has also written some great screenplays and stories. Blade, Blade 2, and Dark City are all his, but his writing abilities seem to be more hit-and-miss than substantially consistent talent.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan directs and kicks in his two cents' worth in the screenplay department... I'm not impressed with his body of work. I liked Insomnia, but let's face it: Nothing I'd seen so far said to me that Batman Begins would even be watchable, much less entertaining.<br /><br />To be honest, I didn't even WANT to like this movie for several reasons...<br /><br />* Michael Keaton did so well with Batman<br /><br />* Schumacher was so total in his obliteration of the franchise, I could not see any reason to beat the dead horse<br /><br />* A fan of the \\"Dark Knight\\" I was tired of being disappointed at the cinema by the direction in which the franchise had gone<br /><br />I must say that I'm very glad I saw this in the theater (on the \\"big screen\\"). Just think; I almost missed witnessing a true rebirth of this franchise!<br /><br />The casting was work of art in itself. Some unlikely choices really REALLY pay off. Two character actors were cast against type, but it seems to have been a brilliant choice!<br /><br />The effects were dynamic, and the sets and backgrounds were more than realistic. The stunts seemed to be more wire work than CGI (thankfully), lending a more believable and realistic feel to this endeavor. And gone (again, thankfully) are the hiddeous nipples from the Bat-Suit! (Curses Joel Schumacher for ever adding them in !!)<br /><br />The thing which most impressed me about this film was the story. It was fantastic! I've read reviews by the \\"professional\\" reviewers, and one in particular claimed that the movie got lost in the beginning to find itself again only at the end. I'm learning NOT to listen to the \\"professional\\" reviewers and to judge for myself.<br /><br />I have to say that by going through the changes in the beginning, you fully understand the motivations and abilities demonstrated by the Dark Knight. Because quite frankly, this isn't just Batman anymore. If the new franchise follows this first installment, it will literally BE the Dark Knight vein of the comic book series! THIS is the Batman I grew up with, not the campy, weak-@ss byotch who cracks off one-liners while feebly dealing justice to ineptly stupid criminal miscreants. Adam West was \\"A\\" Batman. Michael Keaton was \\"THE\\" Batman. Bale is the Dark Knight; it's a totally different animal.<br /><br />The nemeses in this one are Ra's Al Ghul and the Scarecrow, with a promise of meeting the Dark Knight's \\"Joker\\" in the next installment!<br /><br />This movie exhibits perfect direction from start to finish, never loses itself, never loses the audience, and with great relish fights its way through to a superb and satisfying ending.<br /><br />I can't WAIT for the next one!<br /><br />It gets a 9.5/10 and yes, that's a big leap from the rating I gave Burton's Batman cuz let's face it: Bale isn't a better Batman, but the movie itself is LIGHTYEARS better!Batman, but the movie itself is LIGHTYEARS better!
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Dream Theater is one of my favorite bands.  I own most of their CDs, my all time favorites are \\"Images and Words\\", \\"Awake\\", \\"Metropolis part 2\\", \\"6 Degrees\\", and now \\"Octavarium\\".  I think \\"Falling into infinity\\" and \\"Train of Though\\" were their weakest proyects, i almost felt dissapointent with TofT, but with this CD they have recaptured me as a big fan.  Favorite songs: Root of all evil (the chorus makes me fly everytime), these walls (pure magic, DT at its best), I walk beside you (yes, i like it very much,although somewhat more commercial than what they used to do), and of course Octavarium. <br /> <br />If you like most of DTs CDs I highly recommend this.
068987474X|5.0|There is no question, this book is a must read.

B00000K31Q|3.0|'10 Things I Hate About You' is a movie we have seen so many times before, containing all the usual clich&eacute;s, but somehow works because of its stars Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger. Loosely based on Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew' this is a high school comedy that understands you need to use the stars in a nice way to get away with the flaws.<br /><br />The ending may be all too perfect and happy but by the end you'll just love Julia Stiles' character sooo much that you'll be glad for her. There are some great laughs and a hilarious overprotected father played by Larry Miller who has some killer lines that had me in hysterics. There's not just comedy though, there's a few heart felt moments (those who've seen the movie I'm talking about the bit with the poem!) Overall I would recommend this movie to everyone. Don't be put off by the teen movie tag, because it's a really fun movie for teens and those beyond their teen years!  Oh, and the soundtrack is fantastic!
0596007124|3.0|I haven't finished this book. I had already bought the book and then read in the book why I should buy the book. Too many pages are  wasted talking about why the book is so good and not about the subject.
B0002KVUKW|1.0|This movie is a ******* mess... if Shelley and Stoker were here w/ us, they would probably commit suicide after watching this terrible movie. It's just the worst distortion of the original stories I've ever seen. Yes, the special effects are great; yes, Hugh Jackman portrays Van Helsing in a very \\"Wolverine\\" way and yes, Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous; but this movie represents a literary crime in the worst degree... What a waste of time!
B000BT97AO|5.0|I thoroughly loved this movie. The characters were fascinating, the special effects were outstanding, the storyline mesmerizing. A visual feast to gorge the most jaded eye.  <br />The creation of an entire alternate kingdom via charcoal etchings was an extraordinary angle.  <br />The casting was wonderful. Characterization, plot, all outstanding. <br />See this movie.  <br />I wish I could give it more stars.
0811806405|5.0|I've been looking for this sort of book.  I'm just starting to get into building, and this book offers excellent step-by-step instructions for building a steel-string or classical guitar from scratch.  It definitely leans toward traditional methods, which i like a lot.  For example, there is little discussion of spraying finishes, but a lengthy description of the technique of flowing lacquer with a brush.  Lots of good pictures and diagrams, and the text is well-written and very understandable to someone with a basic working knowledge of guitar construction.  Highly recommended.
B000000OQF|5.0|Yes, this was the album that made people want to keep faith in rock. One of the most amazing records to come out in my lifetime. This album kicked everyone's butt period.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|This is a fun entertaining movie.  Even people who aren't too terribly interested in science fiction will enjoy this movie.  My only suggestion is to watch the first episode of the TV series it was based off of (Firefly).  The episode really lays the foundation for the connection between the characters in the movie.  All in all, a great flick!
B000002H3E|5.0|This release was more commercial friendly then their magnificent TOOTH AND NAIL, but it is still just as enjoyable - just different.  Lyrically speaking, there are at 4-5 songs on here that explore the \\"having been wronged by the femme-fatale\\" theme that appears often enough on Dokken releases so as to almost make those lyrics a Dokken trademark. <br /> <br />Anyone who has ever been disappointed in love should be able to relate to Dokken's thorough covering of the subject, whether it be \\"searching for love on the lonely streets again\\" (The Hunter), betrayal of confidence (Don't Lie To Me), yearning for a love that still flourishes although it is history (In My Dreams), or the helplessness one feels when a loved one exits one's life (Slippin' Away).  I think that has been a big reason Dokken has had such a lasting appeal to their fans because this is a subject so many of them can relate to. <br /> <br />I love Don Dokken's voice.  He doesn't exhibit the same range as someone like Rob Halford (then again, who does?), but his voice can suit perfectly for all-out rockers like \\"Lightnin' Strikes\\" or ballads like \\"Slippin' Away\\" with equal justification.  Can you imagine Rob Halford or Ronnie James Dio singing ballads?  To me, it just doesn't work as well as Don Dokken's would on Dokken's ballads.  Don's voice and style works out great in either capacity. <br /> <br />The first three songs, plus \\"Don't Lie To Me\\", are what I would classify as \\"melodic metal\\" - musically speaking, similar in style to the Scorpions.  A theme and beat is recorded and diversified with George Lynch's intricate guitar work so as to maintain listener interest through the songs. <br /> <br />\\"Unchain the Night\\" is a great opener to the release - a mid-tempo track with a thumping bass hook and Don Dokken's soaring vocals.  Dokken had opened shows with this number on tour before. <br /> <br />\\"The Hunter\\" is a another mid-tempo track, similar to the previous one.  Lyrically it's about a broken-hearted guy \\"searching for love on the lonely streets again\\" that he himself acknowledges may be in vain. <br /> <br />\\"In My Dreams\\" - remember the video to this?  George Lynch's fancy fingerwork in this guitar solo is AMAZING.  (Incidentally, some techno-dance musicians call THE PARTY redid this in 1991 that promises an intersting comparison.)  \\"Don't Lie To Me\\" on the same CD is similar to this song. <br /> <br />\\"Slippin' Away\\" is a power-ballad similar to \\"Alone Again\\" Dokken had released a year earlier.  \\"Jaded Heart\\" is the other slow song on the CD. <br /> <br />\\"Lightnin' Strikes\\" and \\"Til The Livin' End\\" are the all out, rapid fire tempo songs on here with the thunderous drums and Lynch's lightning fast fretwork.  That is stuff to crash your car to. <br /> <br />\\"It's Not Love\\" got a fair amount or radio and MTV airplay  It does not happen to be one of my preferred Dokken recording, but it is a fan favorite, so let the other reviews tell you more about that track. <br /> <br />\\"Will The Sun Rise\\" sounds like a song that could have appreared on Def Leppard's HYSTERIA.  It is a political statement against war.  Listen to the song \\"Give It Up\\" from Don Dokken's solo CD UP FROM THE ASHES.  They are lyrically similar. <br /> <br />Give this Dokken offering a serious listen - it ranks up there with \\"Tooth And Nail\\" as their best release. <br />
0307276902|4.0|I was midway through this book when the media found out that there were \\"embellishments\\" by the author.  I have to say that even though it wasn't 100% true, it is still a great book and my fastest read ever.  The only problem with this book is that is should be in the \\"based on a true story\\" section rather than the \\"memoir\\" section.  It is a gripping account of drug and alcohol rehab and I couldn't agree more with his thoughts of personal responsibility and choice.

0743490304|4.0|The main characters are Rachel Sexton, Michael Tolland, William Pickering, Senator Sexton, and President Zach Herney. There are more characters that are also important that appear throughout the novel. This novel takes place in the present time, with many locations, and two main ones; Washington D.C., and the Artic. Like Browns, other novels this one is also packed with action, thriller, and some romance.<br /><br />This novel wasn't that hard to read. Dan Brown is one of my favorite authors. He talks about things that could happen now. Throughout the novel a lot of NASA related things are talked about that the common American might have no idea what it is. Brown writes it in a way that anyone can understand it. The way he captures your attention makes you never want to put down the book. With every turn of the page something new is happening. The thrills never let up. Brown always keeps you guessing. He gives you just enough information to think one way and later on you find out that it's someone you wouldn't have expected. One way that he really gets your attention is by having all of these twists throughout the novel. You never know what is going to happen next. To keep track of all the different characters, Brown keeps the chapters short and dedicated to a certain character or situation. The reader can follow along with what is actually happening with each character. Majority of this novel is action and a thriller. Most of the characters at one point face a great peril on their life. You never know when it's going to come. Brown also adds the element of romance between Rachel and Michael. After everything that these two went through, it wouldn't seem right for them not to be together.  Another reason why this novel is exceptional, is because he talks about things that people think could happen but don't say. Most of what he talks about is true or has a very good chance of being real. In today's society, with NASA how it is, I could believe this.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Very good movie.  It's like a mix of western and science fiction.  Definitely an unpublicized gem worth seeing.  I love the infusion of Chinese culture in almost a Blade Runner fashion. Big thumbs up.
0060523794|4.0|As an IBM BP's employee. This books give a good view of how Mr. Gerstner bring the big blue back to it previous leadership and even better. The experience shared by Mr. Gerstner is valuable and this is a must read even for people who encounter personal challenges.
0723247609|5.0|How wonderful it has been to get reintroduced to all of Potter's sweet characters.  My mom had a small board book collection when I was growing up and I forgot all about these stories.  There is just something so warm and relaxing about them.  My four year old is loving them (they're a bit too long for my two year old's attention span and she usually wanders away after awhile).  However you just can't go wrong with this book--it's a classic and definitely timeless.  My only suggestion is that sometimes a \\"complete\\" edition is the cheaper route to go, but it does make for a heavy book for little ones to tote around or try to flip through.  So if you are looking for something to be a more kid friendly you may want to purchase the individual stories separately.

0060989157|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read!  It is so shocking what rock bands from the 80's went through!  I would have never guessed any of this ever happened.  A must read book if you were an 80's teenager and still love Motley Crue!!!!
1592400876|5.0|This book is for anyone that knows the difference between these two phrases: \\"eats shoots and leaves\\" and \\"eats, shoots and leaves.\\"  I laughed all the way through as I identified with the author's angst at the incorrect punctuation that has invaded the public \\"norm.\\"

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|I applaud any band that is musically adventurous, exploring varying styles as their discography evolves.  Here, the \\"rock-n-roll rescuing\\" Strokes have almost done that.  I say almost because many of the tracks seem to be stuck halfway between The Strokes' typical style and an artsier level of music.  A handful of the songs on this album are noticeably harder and more grinding, like \\"Heart in a Cage\\" and \\"Vision of Division\\", and to be honest, are unpleasant to listen to.  Another handful of the songs are a little more experimental, like \\"Ask Me Anything\\", which includes Casablanca's (un-fuzzed!) voice over some sort of warped cello.  This song is actually an interesting innovation, and would fit well into a good album -- unfortunately, as the seventh track on the album, it is sandwiched in mediocrity.  The next third of the album is the successful third, the third that hails back to the last two albums.  These songs include the stellar opener \\"You Only live Once\\", the bubbly-Valensi-riff feel-good tune \\"Razorblade\\", and what is probably the sole success of the artsier turn, \\"Ize of the World\\" (except the title is really stupid).  The latter actually contains some of the best Strokes lyrics yet (not that that's some monumental accomplishment), with commentary on matters outside of Casablanca's failed relationships.  The bottom line: the artsier and experimental turn of the album has lukewarm results, while the more traditional material glimmers amongst the rest of the noise.  If The Strokes want to become a more musically diverse band -- which I am by no means advising against, and in fact am in support of, for any band -- it will require more than this album's half-hearted attempt.  Until then, I recommend sticking with their current and successful formula.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink floyd are my favourite group of all time.they are great,superb,terrific,brilliant and excellent.I like all their albums especially this one,the wall,wish you were here and animals.The dark side of the moon is the greatest album ever which has sold more than 40 million copies till date.If you like good music,get this.recommended.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  Don't go into it expecting some riveting cinematic milestone, or something that is side-splittingly hilarious, in fact, don't go in expecting anything.  If you go into this movie with an open mind you will enjoy it.  The bland corniness of the characters, the strange poignancy, the directionless storyline, and every other aspect of the movie somehow blend together to create a lighthearted and funny microcosm of adolescence and the high-school years.  I don't think there is any underlying meaning or societal commentary.  It is almost like a small-scale version of Forrest Gump -- it speaks to the value of true friendship, but other than that, is merely a snapshot of a period of someone's life.
B00030590I|5.0|This movie has it all: epic battles, outstanding sword play, wu xia, romance, intrigue. Based loosely on an historical character--the cruel, but shrewd Xin, the first man to unite the provences of China into a single country. The hero's goal is to assinate Xin to avenge his father's death and to relieve is home provence from the threat of the cruel Xin. He executes a clever ploy to get close enough to Xin, again loosely based on an historical attempt on Xin's life, to acheive his goal. Both men, face to face, are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for what they believe in in the spell-binding climax. I would put this movie on par with Chariots of Fire for the portrayal of man's struggle for truth and integrity--with great action as anyone familiar with Jet Li would expect and spectacular cinematography.
B0006399FS|5.0|One of the bests of U2! Also the brazilian show, in Morumbi Stadium, at So Paulo-SP, amazing! Bono was better than ever! He is great! Hope he enjoyed his stay in Brazil (and Carnival in Salvador-Bahia) like we enjoyed their VERTIGO TOUR ALIVE!
B000CBSHK2|1.0|A leading Americana music magazine whose opinions I usually agree with gave this CD great review. Sorry. It just doesn't resonate with me. Too much reliance on atmospheric percussion that bubbles just below the surface. No memorable melodies to latch on to. Sameness of material. Lack of all traces of humor.  <br /> <br />Throw in her very unpleasant voice and you have a CD destined for the resale bin....which is where mine ended up.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Just finished my third viewing of this film.  I love the offbeat quirkiness of the characters and some of the bizzare storylines.  Overall, this is a sexy, beautiful love story with a wonderful ending.  I love everything about this movie!
B0007M22TI|5.0|If you like Neo-Celtic music like Riverdance, then this is a must see.. While i prefer traditional celtic music, this was a good concert. It had a pleasant mix of Celtic and Orchestral New Age music. With a little bit of Choir thrown in for good measure. The choral group \\"Anuna\\" back's up a few of the singer for this. If you like this style of music, then i would recommend buying this.

B0006OBPTA|4.0|The Karate Kid has been around now for over two decades.  We bought this set of four movies because we think the Karate Kid is a good role model for our 4-year old boy. <br /> <br />It's funny, when these movies came out, I did my best not to watch them because I was already a teenager and the Karate kid was this dorky younger teen for whom I didn't have any sympathy.  Now that I am older, I see the real value in these movies.  The boy went from being a self-absorbed \\"I'm so cool\\" dork, to learning the meaning of self-respect and dignity, while in the process earning the respect of others.  This four-movie set is definitely worth the price if you value these personal traits.  As a bonus we got to see the fourth movie which I hadn't seen before.
0060899190|5.0|Warren's book is really a canvas - of \\"master-pieces\\" - from the raw, hilarious, heart-breaking, fall down laughable, scary, and down right terrifying people that you interact with every day. The post cards of \\"secrets\\" confessed could come from anyone - and it made me realize what a HUNGER there is in our world for confession. To tell someone the deep dark secret. To loose the burdens that bind us, haunt us, hold us back in our lives and loves. Is this a post-modern confession booth? And who renders the absolution? I wonder about the people who wrote the post-cards - I pray for them and wish them healing as they do the best they can to get by day by day with these secrets. It would be fascinating to know if sending in their burdens was like casting them off on the skapegoat, and if they were able to have some \\"closure\\" or find some peace, forgiveness, or restoration. What a sensational idea that appears to be liberating many! You go Frank Warren!
0743490304|5.0|Although Dan Brown became famous with The DaVinci Code, Deception Point, written and published before DaVinci, demonstrates that he is a master of the thriller. This book has everything you could want in a page turner- suspense, intrigue, romance, sex, humor, adventure, and good, strong, likable characters.<br /><br />The main protagonist is Rachel Sexton, a gister- someone who writes a digest of the reports of various intelligence agencies for President Zach Herney. Rachel's father is Senator Sedgwick Sexton, a major opponent of the president. The relationship between Sexton and his daughter is appropriately tense-- he doesn't like her working for his opponent, she doesn't like his politics. They try to keep their political differences from affecting their relationship but don't always succeed.<br /><br />Rachel is quite happy in her job when one day she is called to meet with the president and then is whisked off to a glacier in the frozen Arctic where a secret NASA facility has been built. Her job is to validate the discovery of an immense, round, extraterrestrial meteor with fossils embedded in it.<br /><br />This is an important discovery for NASA, as they have increasingly come under fire in recent years because of their many mission problems. Senator Sedgwick is one of their biggest opponents. If Rachel can validate this discovery as authentic, it will provide a huge boost to NASA's image. After examining all the evidence and talking to all the scientists at the site, Rachel is convinced that the artifact is genuine. She is thrust in front of a camera to announce the discovery to White House staff- and then the fun begins.<br /><br />The action starts fast and furious as Rachel and oceanographer Michael Tolland escape attack from an elite Delta force, parachute across the ice, drop into the frozen ocean and are rescued by a nuclear submarine. This is just the first third of the book, but the remaining chapters are equally thrilling and keep the reader on the edge of their seat.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version of this book, narrated capably by Boyd Gaines. The book was thrilling, exciting, and hard to put down. There were enough twists and turns in the plot until it was impossible to know who could be trusted. At the end, Brown wraps everything up in a tidy, satisfactory way. Definitely a 5-star read!er on the edge of their seat. <br /> <br />I listened to the audio version of this book, narrated capably by Boyd Gaines.

0307276902|2.0|I know this book has spoken to so many addicts - and if it accomplishes healing tasks and a stepping stone for people to boost themselves up and re-build their lives - I'm thrilled. But I honestly don't get all the hype. Even before the post-Oprah expose of the \\"whole truth\\" of the book, I found it to be far less than critics who I really respect were making it to be. It's sort of like this - instead of I go on the mountain, I discover nirvana, I give it to the people - it's - I go to rehab - I realize I AM nirvana (it's all about me, I don't really need you), and you should realize it's all about YOU. Me, me, me, that's all I kept reading through the lines of the book - it seems to saturate our culture of narcisism and fascination with our own belly lint - and I wonder - is it really all that helpful ultimately to believe it's all about you and your power? <br /> <br />Having said this, there were important moments in this book - whether they were contrived or not doesn't really matter to me - because Frey's heart is not contrived. I just hope that this is but the beginning of Frey's journey, and that he does find a way to not have to take on it all himself. I know he does do this through some of the characters - Leonard really is a great one - he made me really care about Leonard. But maybe some of the precepts of AA aren't as unneccessary as you think.
0142001104|5.0|An outstanding book that is not only inspiring but so very practical to anyone in a supervisory role or as a parent, spouse or just a human being trying to lead a happy life.
0307276902|3.0|I was about midway in the book when the controversy broke. I had told many people that it was one of the best and most fascinating book I had ever read. When Oprah revealed that it was fiction, I tried to read on but could not. Even at the very beginning when Frey told about his root canals and the capping of his teeth, I thought \\"how could anyone survive that?\\" I plan to go back and finish the book some day, but it will be with a different attitude. This time I will be reading it as fiction loosely based on facts. I am very disappointed in the writer. He is a very talented author but has ruined his opportunity to be remembered as one of the great writers of our time. Instead,he will be remembered as a liar and a deceiving inddividual.
B000BYA5GO|2.0|The one thing I noticed when I was going to review this movie was making the decision about giving it a 2 or a 3 stars. I don't think it is good enough to be a 3 by some of the other movies I have rated but I don't think it is bad enough to be a 2. So 2 1/2 I guess. I saw the previews of this movie and thought I would check it out. I looked like an interesting premise based on a very interesting subject. I thought that Nicholas Cage did an excellent job as the former Russian immigrant who turned small time arms dealer and then into an major international arms dealer. Again the subject is something that is very intriguing and very interesting but alas the movie just drags. I remember when watching it thinking, \\"this is going to be good.\\" Then, \\"this is pretty good\\" and then as it went on and on I was thinking, \\"man, ok, I wish this thing would wrap up and end.\\" So somewhere in there it lost me. Jared Leto was accutally pretty good as Cages brother and Cage has a pretty hot wife. The guy that plays the African dictator is great and does a really good job. The movie also shows a lot about the politics and cultures of the African nations that are torn and fed by violence and arms. Also I almost forgot that Ethan Hawke is very good as the ATF guy that is pursuing Cage. But somewhere in all this the movie loses something and is over long and just not that good.
B000023VR6|5.0|This is my all time favorite rap album.  I purchased it when it first came out and listened to it until the cd didn't work.  I've purchased it again because there really isn't any appealing rap or hip hop music out right now and there hasn't been for a while.  Dr. Dre knows what he's doing and does it very very well.  I highly recommend this to rap/hip hop fans.

The official GMAC book is extremely good ....the questions are tough and thorough....if I had more study time I would have bought all three of the regular GMAC books. <br /> <br />I ended up getting a 740 on the GMAT but it wasn't due to Kaplan, my score was great because I bought the real test-takers study guide.

B000784WMW|5.0|This is by far the best adaptation of Jane Eyre of the many that I have seen. It is the most faithful to the book, keeping to the details and the character of the novel.  <br />     The cast is superb. Timothy Dalton is  absolutely wonderful as Rochester and Zelah Clark really is perfection as Jane Eyre. I have never seen another version which I feel comes even close to this one. It is a find on every level-text, casting, locale etc.!

One of modern horror's best.  <br /> <br />
B0000057C5|4.0|The beat, and rhythms of this album stay pretty constant.  I liked the variation of having a song in English, instead of German, included in the album.
B00068NVI4|4.0|I'm a long time YES fan and have enjoyed almost every piece they've ever done.  This DVD has a lot of their old songs and some new ones too.  Don't get me wrong, this is a good DVD for died-hard YES fans but there is something about the way it was recorded.  It's lacking something but I don't know what.  I'm comparing it with the DVD YES Symphonic Live.  From the opening song (Close To The Edge) of that DVD all the way through was so amazing and energetic.  I think it was the lively European Festival Orchestra that played with YES.  But getting back to Songs From Tsongas, if you are a die-hard YES fan, then definately buy this DVD.  But if you want add YES to your DVD concert collection, this is the one to get.

B000065V1V|5.0|I have listened to all of Bowies music other than the rare B-side stuff from the 70s singles and I have not been disappointed.Instead my love for his music grows and grows and Heathen has pushed me to climax. <br /> <br />Opening with \\"Sunday\\" we hear what sounds like isolation. It is cold and rainy and nothing remains making us grieve for a more lively emotion. \\"Nothing has changed and everything has changed\\" the lyrics read. Such a true statement when you dive deep into everything. We drift along with the time where everthing is changing but doesn't seem original. A NEW phone has a different look but does the same thing. <br /> <br />After a slow start a new feeling begins. A cover of 'CACTUS' gives us revenge. A lover leaving someone behind with a broken heart and this person wanting to be nasty in return. The vocals emphasise this with Bowie singing \\" So bloody your hands on the cactus tree. Make your dress all wet and send it to me.\\" <br />I assume the first track was dealing with grievance and the second track got sick of this emotion and wanted to hate it. <br /> <br />However, track 3 goes back to the cold and empty feeling.'SLIP AWAY' talks about Uncle Floyd, a clown who's old and everyone and everything he loved was now deceased.So far the album seems as though it is talking about something missing in each of it's songs. <br /> <br />Track 4 would have to be the highlight of the album in my opinion. You have an awesome guitar and bass sound throughout the song as if the guitar is in pain and is bleeding.'SLOWBURN' introduces a unique sound of pain along with the gripping lyrics \\"There's fear overhead.There's fear all around.\\" There's no escaping fear. 9/11 would fit this song perfectly however the event occured afterwards. It is a dramatic hard hitting song that discomforts you and that to me is powerful. <br /> <br />Track 5 and 6 were my least favorite on the album but they both still offer a commercially successful pop rock sound. As singles they woulddo well just like every other song on Heathen and they are more fast pace than the other songs.'AFRAID' and 'I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU' start and end quickly and deal with despair and grievance once again. <br /> <br />The later tracks on the album have a futuristic feel and also prove that Bowie still has the element of being ahead of time like he was with his character Ziggy Stardust and the symphosizer in 'LOW'. <br /> <br />Another worthwhile detail is the finish to the album and the track 'EVERYONE SAYS HI!'. <br />'EVERYONE SAYS HI!' proves that Bowie can still be commercially successful. Too bad a lot of commercial radio stations only attract audiences who listen to tacky pop princesses,monotanous rap songs and other garbage.It is very mellow but a great song nevertheless. <br /> <br />'HEATHEN(THE RAYS)' closes the album and sounds very futuristic. It sounds like spaceships ascending into the distance, disappearing like the subject matter in the song. A great fade out ends the song nicely making it one of the best endings to an album I have ever heard. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album to everyone especially anyone who gave up on Bowie in the 90's.There are no bad songs on this album. It is something not to be missed. <br /> <br />Written By Jamie Jacobs.
0307276902|1.0|I can't believe he is still ranked so high. I do not endorse this book. I have read it. At that time - I thought that it was an ok book - now that I have heard all the news surrounding Frey...I am disappointed. I do not blame the publisher - only the author. He knew better. His books should be pulled off the shelf. Instead - go buy John Michael Forosisky's book called Passenger's Side. IT IS REAL! Great book. A must read!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|The art and work put into this taping of Cats was amazing. The choreography, the planning, the writing, the art - it surprised me.

0064409422|5.0|The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe is a great book for people of all ages.  It can be understood by children as young as the 5th grade, and loved by people as old as 80.  It's a classic book that every person should read.  The story is about 4 children sent to live with a Professor to escape the bombings during the war.  They stumble upon a strange wardrobe in this man's house and it takes them to the magical world of Narnia.  This story is a great adventure with the classic battle of Good vs. Evil, and Right and Wrong.   <br /> <br /> When I first started reading this book, I became frustrated at how simplistic the writing was and was getting really annoyed with Lewis' warnings not to close yourself in a wardrobe; but then I realized this was a book written to be enjoyed by children as well as adults.  I enjoyed the way C.S. Lewis portrayed his four main characters.  His in depth description of them made you feel like you knew them.  Peter is the oldest and wisest of the children, the bravest and the greatest.  Edmund is the traitor, the selfish, and the annoying one; who later realizes his faults and becomes a compassionate and nice boy.  Susan is the most mature of the children and she has a motherly demeanor and caring heart.  Lucy is the most adventurous and mischievous of the group and the most faithful and hopeful.   <br /> <br />        I love the way some parts of the book parallel with The Bible.  Aslan represents Jesus:  Aslan's sacrifice for Edmund and Narnia is parallel to Jesus' sacrifice for everyone.  Edmund's betrayal to his brother and sisters symbolizes sin; and the White Witch can be compared to Satan.   <br /> <br /> <br />        The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe is truly a classic book that should be read by everyone.  Its entertainment value is the same for all ages and is an awesome adventure with a great message.   <br />
B0002SROT0|5.0|Elliot Smith's \\"From a Basement on the Hill,\\" sadly was his last work. This album has a wide range of intimate guitar riffs which pull at the heart strings coupled with sincere graceful lyrics, moody melancholic rock riffs and jaggedy production. I really enjoyed this recording. He did not have final say on the mix, but whoever mixed this record did a fine job. I never got bored of it. It's genious! HIs harmonies like \\"The Mama's and the Papa's,\\" will withstand the test of time.
6305949980|5.0|Interestingly, the director of this film was previously known for directing the Pillsbury Doughboy commercials.  It was much, much better than I had expected.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great series and Fox didn't know a good thing when it saw it.  Apparently smart TV has no place on this network. Please buy this series and the movie follow-up Serenity.  Support Joss Whedon! Story line developed nicely, great character development, entertaining way to access cutting edge social theory through pop (sci-fi is not about the future--it is a reflection of the culture and the human condition).  All this said, please don't let the pearl handled revolvers and space travel turn you off.

B00005QFE5|5.0|Of all the Zhang Ziyi movies, I like this one the best.  She is not part of an ensemble.  She is the star here.  It's one of her early movies.  And the director captures her pure innocent beauty strikingly.  Plus the beauty of the mountains, and an emotional story.  The Chinese can be very romantic.
B000002UC5|5.0|Sometimes a brilliant first effort can become a millstone around an artist's neck, so that all subsequent work pales in comparison, at least as far as the fans are concerned. Now, I don't know if Paul McCartney had that thought in mind -- certainly he already had his reputation as a Beatle, and he knew he'd carry THAT weight a long time! -- but his first official solo album is a ramshackle joy. I actually like the fact that it has odds 'n' ends, bits 'n' pieces of songs mixed in with some outright gems. \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is worth the price of the album alone, to be honest. But the unfinished fragments have their own small pleasures. Paul sounds relaxed, at ease, simply enjoying himself & his newfound life. And for that very reason, this sometimes maligned first album has grown for me over the years, becoming a hidden treasure of sorts. I often listen to it when I need a respite from everyday life, a reminder of the simple things. Most highly recommended!
B000002G8H|2.0|I don't understand why many people entitle this album: \\"the best of Eric Clapton\\".For me,Slowhand is simply a \\"flat\\" album.....If you want the best Clapton's albuns, buy the following:Eric Clapton <br />                          Live -The Rainbow Concert <br />                          There's one in every Crowd <br />                          Money and Cigarettes <br />                          Behind the Sun <br />                          Journeyman <br />                          live-24 nights <br />                          Pilgrim <br />                          Rush <br />                          One more car, one more rider. <br />                          layla
B0006GANN2|1.0|Unfortunately, This particular DVD was of such poor quality that I will have second thoughts about purchasing any DVD's in the future.
B00004Y6NM|4.0|However it's not between the best works of Claptom, Behind the Sun is a good album.This album is better than the \\"weak\\" and \\"boring\\" Backless, slowhand ,Just one night and Ocean Boulevard.He has powerful as well as \\"romantic\\"songs.In short,a good album!!!!
0321344758|5.0|I am taking a HCI (Human Computer Interaction) course, and this book really applies many of the basic principles that we are learning in the class.  I picked it up because we are creating a website for our course project, and I wanted to have some details on web usability.<br /><br />Some of the stuff that Steve talks about seems obvious after you read it, but you may otherwise not think of it yourself.  The book shows some great examples of what is broken, and how it can be fixed.  While it didn't dive into tons of HCI stuff, it was a great introduction to web usability.<br /><br />This was one of the first \\"techie\\" books that I finished cover to cover.  It's definitely an easy read.  I finished it in a weekend, and I am the slowest reader in the world (ok...maybe not, but pretty close).<br /><br />I also plan on picking up Jakob Nielsen's new one when it comes out in March of 2006.
B000069AUI|5.0|This CD ranks number one in my collection most of the time (you have to understand that my number one is always changing - it really depends on my mood) and I really enjoy listening to it every time.     I bought this CD before Parachutes, which does give me a different perspective of the album from people who bought Parachutes before AROBTTH.     My favorite songs:  Clocks  God Put A Smile Upon Your Face  Amsterdam  A Whisper  In My Place    At least, those were the songs I fell in love with on my first spin. They've stayed with me ever since; but I've really come to love every song on this album. The great thing about the way this album was made was that Coldplay wasn't trying to be anything; they just wanted to make a good album. And I am sure as glad as anything that they recorded 'Clocks' and put it in AROBTTH - it was their freshest track on the CD, and I cannot imagine what the album would be like without 'Clocks'.    People have said that 'God Put a Smile upon Your Face' was too experimental to be released as a single; but truthfully it was one of the songs that made me buy this CD (I know I bought it really late - like 2 years after its release). If you've watched the video, I thought it was a really thought-provoking video and to me it was probably more innovative that the videos for 'Trouble' and 'The Scientist'.    I think the best time to listen to this album is when the weather is gloomy, and if you're not feeling too good. Although you can also listen to it on a sunny day and that makes 'In My Place' sound awesome. Whatever suits your fancy, I guess.    Oh, and did I mention I really love the album cover as well? Solve Sundsbo (excuse the exclusion of swedish 'o's) does a great job at drawing the covers for AROBTTH and the singles it spawned.    Compared to X&Y and Parachutes, I'd say this album is better - the arrangements are great, the lyrics probably are more interesting than the other two as well. Parachutes, musically, was probably better, whileX&Y was edgier and had a more 'arena rock' feel, but AROBTTH has the best production out of the three, and the music, though not necessarily showing growth but more of a different direction(I don't think an album necessarily becomes 'good' if the artist appears to the listener to have matured...), definitely appealed to me more.    Not everyone appreciates this album and buy it only for 'Clocks', which is understandable - the first time I bought it that was the only song on replay, but really every song here is a masterpiece. It took me like 2 weeks to really get into it, and I think to the casual listener, they might want something instant rather than cultivated.
0066620996|4.0|Easy style, lots of good ideas for companies. I was hoping he has more in it about non-profits and government, but it is only business focused. Still it's a good book and Amazon offered it at a great price for a brand new edition.
