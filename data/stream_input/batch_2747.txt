B009LQKHIO|4.0|I highly recommend this book.  It is not your ordinary love story where boy meets girl and they fell in love instantly.  It is more like two people trying to find peace from the past that they are trying hard to leave behind.  In the process finding each other and learning to accept that for them peace and love can only be achieved together.<br /><br />Megan is an abused wife, physically, emotionally and mentally.  One would even wonder how she was able to endure all those and remain standing.  It was heart wrenching when she lost her brother too, the only soul that she knows love her truthfully.<br /><br />Todd has suffered too when he lost his wife and unborn child especially at the time when he believed he is ready to begin a family.  Convincing himself to move on and love again came a long time, until he met Megan.  He was enthralled by her beauty and fragility, and taking a vow to do everything to make it right for her.<br /><br />The story was heartwarming and doesn't just focus on the love of a man and woman but the concept of love in a family.  How they have supported each other through thick and thin.  I would probably get the next book to see how the equally interesting Lacey finds the love of her life.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King's \\"Joyland\\" was a rich and enjoyable summer reading experience.  Just don't expect the torrid crime novel the cover promises.  No, what you get here is a gentle tale, set during the summer of 1973, about a decent young man named Devin Jones- his heart recently broken- who takes a job at an amusement park during his summer break from college. The friends he makes at the park, his immersion into \\"carny\\" life, and some extra special friends he makes during his walk to and from the park every day via the beach, all fuel a gentle, involving slice-of-life tale about a young man confronting the joys and trials of growing up.<br /><br />Yes, there is a crime story in the book- rooted in a years-old unsolved murder that took place in Joyland's sole dark, scary ride- but the investigation of the old crime by Devin and his friends only lightly peppers the bulk of the book, and only comes to dominate the story in the last thirty pages or so.  The crime story is a good one, filled with tension and danger as the old murder threatens to make way for a new one, but it's only a small part of a book that's pretty much dominated by those other, gentler elements I mentioned.  If you're okay with that you'll be fine.<br /><br />And- oh, yes- there are some ghostly, supernatural elements, too- not surprising, given the author.  They're pretty well done, too.  But what you'll probably remember most about Joyland- which inexplicably is being marketed as an old-fashioned pulpy crime novel- is spending a gentle, wondrous, and- yes- often sad summer with Devin and his friends Erin, Tom, Annie, and Mike (the last a young boy you won't soon forget), and how they all made a deep, powerful impression on Devin just when he needed it most.

B00CL0J99K|4.0|Iron Man 3, which is the focus of the Extremis virus and Tony Stark's mental breakdown after the events in The Avengers, is directed and co-written by Shane Black. Here, we see darker action sequences, much more serious plot, but also something that angered hard-core Marvel fans everywhere: The Mandarin, who is literally nothing like the one from the comics. Now, I do love action movies, and comic-to-film movies (DC and Marvel fan), but after watching Iron Man 3, I cannot fathom the stupidity behind the film. First, they turned Tony Stark's most powerful and diabolical enemy into a walking joke (literally) who was supposed to wield the ancient Ten Rings of Power, which came from an alien ship. But no, Shane Black completely removed that plot line from the Avengers universe. Why? Because it wasn't grounded and not realistic enough, and yet, somehow, people who breathe fire and explode is more realistic than aliens. Then, secondly, Aldrich Killian, who was supposed to kill himself for his mistake in creating Extremis, is a main villain here. I will just stop there, because I need to review the movie as a film now.<br /><br />The acting is good, with Downey, Jr. becoming a much more battle-hardened Tony, who must accept the fact that extra-terrestrials exist. Paltrow is great here, showing us a side to Pepper that we have yet to see, and it is awesome. The directing is good, being better than Favreau's in Iron Man 2, but not the first Iron Man. Brian Tyler's musical score is great, capturing both the bombastic action sequences and darkness that is surrounding Tony. The script was good (movie-wise), having a twist that some movie-goers will not see coming. The visual effects were good, but not award-worthy compared to that of other releases (Ex. Pacific Rim, Man of Steel, Oblivion).<br /><br />So, if you have not read the Iron Man comic storyline for \\"Extremis,\\" then you will like this addition. If you have, I suggest you steer away because you will be angry, or suspendyour love for the comics for this film and any further Marvel addition involving Iron Man/Tony Stark.<br /><br />1.5/5 Stars (Comic-to-Film)<br />4/5 Stars (Movie-Only)
0785156593|1.0|I picked this up out of a community share box in my neighborhood.  The story is aweful, art is so so and the whole affair is rather uninteresting and unexciting.  For someone with ultimate cosmic power , Thanos seems to pretty much do nothing with it.  Even the strategy used to defeat him is banal and unimpressive. A much better story dealing with a collection of heroes banding together to take down a seemingly god like foe would be the secret wars 2 saga.

B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is pretty good it doesnt repeat alot but kinda does. Its fun and i like it but the smart thing to do is stop playing for a while to boost energy, you get one energy for every three minutes and dont spend diamonds on things, keep searching rooms to acquire the things you need. Ive been playing two days and am on level eleven, it is fun except the hunting room. Every time you want to go in there it costs ten golden bullets, which, unless collected from other rooms, cost diamonds.  I recomend this app to those who like hidden object games and just people in general i guess. Have fun and happy finding.
0385360169|3.0|I finally broke down and am listening to the audio version of the book in the car.  For one, the actress (presenter, etc.) reading the book can not do more than 2 accents halfway decent.  The \\"voice\\" of Kate is strictly valley girl circa 1986.  Secondly, anytime someone says \\"surely\\" which is really often, it is pronounced \\"Shirley\\".  It sounds like someone saying OMG! Is this a Pacific Northwestern accent thing?<br /><br />Ok, I listened to the actress readout the emails for the better part of 2 long drives. One entire disc was nothing but To: Christian Grey Time: 13:42 Dear Mr. Grey Signed: C.G. and his corporation.  I would have thrown the disc out onto the highway if it didn't belong to the library. Argh.  The author should have said it once or twice and be done with it.  And the many clauses of the contract. If he is up to Clause 15.23 and that is just 15, you need to move on.  I think the author copied word for word from one that was already done.<br /><br />The story is ok.  The sex is a bit much at times.  I picture Michael Fassbender as C.G.  His pants hang off his hips the way it was described umpteenth times.

If you play this game on the Kindle you also.get the updates about to days after they come out for android and about 3 months after they come out for iPod. But this game is very fun, addictive, and exiting. Although League of Legends is still better this is much more mobile and I would recommend it to anybody who likes to play MOBA games.

B00457X8BC|5.0|This story snuck up on me, and grabbed me by the hairs on the back of my neck before I realized what was happening.  I love Wallander, and his angst is probably felt and understood by most middle aged folks.  He is an excellent investigator, but is completely out of his element in Riga. A different country, language, a repressive government that is the antithesis of Sweden at the time combines to create a frightening and anxiety-ridden narrative.<br /><br />It was uncertain who the main &#34;bad guy&#34; was right up to the end.  Many twists and turns throughout, and I had to wonder what I would have done in his place.<br /><br />A great read!

0307383415|5.0|If you can, forget that Barack Obama is the twice-elected, first black president in American history. This volume, written as Obama was preparing to enter politics in 1995, is a deeply lyrical and intelligent telling of his own story, and that of coming of age as a black man in America. Obama is a gifted writer. He recreates the episodes and voices of his life, including the swaggering street talk of those from his high school and community organizing days. The son of a white mother and African father, he details his struggles to make sense of the absence of his father (who left him at the age of two) and the tortured path of finding his identity. Obama grew up between worlds. His white grandparents were from the Midwest, with its mythos of continuous progress and its memories of horrifying setbacks. He was born in Hawaii, a multi-ethnic blend of white, black and Asian, but felt out of place in its wealthy prep schools. He followed his mother and stepfather Lolo to Indonesia, where he picked up firsthand the rhythms, language and values of the Third World. But it was not until he travelled to Kenya, after the death of his father, that the threads of his life started to come together.<br /><br />As I said, Obama is a fine writer. But he is also a wonderful and honest analyst. His struggles for identity are played against a backdrop of poor project dwellers in Chicago, an aimless college start that didn't presage his future brilliance, and the continued distrust between black and white in America and the ever absent and mythologized figure of his father. Had he never become president, this book could well have become the defining work of the age on the subject of race and identity. It is deeply personal, showing a young man's stumbling attempts to make sense of the world around him. And it is a frank book, with Obama working in references to reefer, alcohol and sexual adventure - the very building blocks of youth in America in the 1960s and 70s.<br /><br />For those who are his supporters, \\"Dreams from my Father\\" anticipates the politician and man he became - cool, cerebral, but with a touch of street savvy and personal pain that make him so engaging to listen to. For his detractors, the book will be a goldmine of attack points meant to bring him own as a man and to prove their theories of black depravity. Forget all the hoohah from those like Dinesh D'Souza (\\"2016: Obama's America\\") who blew up a single episode from the book (and got it wrong, at that) to impugn Obama as a deceiver trying to fulfill his father's supposedly socialist dreams. The true \\"Dreams of my Father\\" has the intensity, longing and honesty that will ring true to anyone who has had to fight a battle for their identity in an ever-shifting landscape, and to attempt to pick up the torch dropped by their ancestors in search of the impossible dream of wholeness.ho are his supporters, \\"Dreams from my Father\\" anticipates the politician and man he became - cool, cerebral, but with a touch of street savvy and personal pain that make him so engaging to listen to.

B005LAIGPU|4.0|If you're a horror/science-fiction you'll probably enjoy this film. I wish I had seen it in the theater last year. To be truthful I assumed it was, yet another cornball Final Destination Part.... teenybopper flick. Watched it on cable yesterday and was blown away. Rarely does a film jog the imagination about \\"realistic\\" super power fantasies. Where Unbreakable focused on subtleties Chronicle delves into a world of teenage angst vs. corruption of absolute power. I've read a few review or two which complain about some of the effects or camera work. But let's be real this is a fantasy film and you'll enjoy it much more if you can let loose into suspension of disbelief. Hopefully if there is a sequel it's the same or better as ALIENS was to ALIEN.

B0013FSL3E|2.0|I know a lot of people consider this one of Pixar's greatest, but I find this one of Pixar's worst. I'm sorry, but when I saw this in the theater, it was boring, especially the first half. I almost fell asleep, just like with &#34; Happy Feet&#34;! Without the dialogue, I could not follow what was happening! The second half, ehhhhhhh, maybe there was some dialogue with the humans, but it still had little to no effort. That is really a shame because WALL-E was such a cute hero! His romance with EVE was cute, the villain was decent, the story had a good environmental message so many opportunities wasted because of a lack of dialogue! I admit I really liked the &#34; Presto&#34; short which was funny enough not to NEED dialogue. THIS feature film on the other hand is inexcusable! I remember I loved &#34; Kung Fu Panda&#34; WAY more than this in the summer of 2008. It's films like &#34; Kung Fu Panda&#34; that makes me think Dreamworks sometimes ( but not always) do better, and makes me doubt Pixar. I guess &#34;WALL-E&#34; is not that terrible, it just didn't do much for me. I am skipping thos one.

Also totally a great read for those reluctant to read teenage boys that like to live in video games.<br /><br />I'm so glad that this was part of a monthly book club read.  I don't think I would have ever thought to read it any other way and I really would be missing out.  If you liked the 80s, anime, coin op video games, MMoRPGs or even just dystopias there is something in this book for you.  I couldn't believe how many of the 80s music and movie/tv references and quote I picked out.  I really was in geek heaven with references to John Hugh's movies, schoolhouse rock,  Ghostbuster's quotes and flash backs to old school video games that I once played on an Atari.<br /><br />\\"It's chick flick disguised as a sword-and-sorcery picture. The only genre film with less balls is probably... freakin' Legend.

Wade was easy to like, he was orphaned and living with his Aunt in poverty just doing everything he could to get by.  He is smart inventive and absolutely obsessed with the quest for the Egg.  I enjoyed the trash talk between Wade and him friends and the world Wade lives in is totally interesting even if it is bleak.<br /><br />At times there is a lot of info dumping about games or research Wade was doing but I was entirely interested and couldn't wait to see where the story would go.  There is a slight love interest that highjacks the story for a bit.

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Qur'an (5:51) - \\"O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.\\"<br /><br />Qur'an (3:54) - \\"And they (the disbelievers) schemed, and Allah schemed (against them): and Allah is the best of schemers.\\"<br /><br />A healthy amount of skepticism is necessary when the author hides his faith and that faith is bent on destroying an other religions. He comes off as a snake oil salesman. Saying \\"I found Jesus at fifteen\\" and then eventually dancing around the fact that he returned to the religion of his parents, is not being honest, it is hiding a very relevant fact in the fine print.<br /><br />Would you read a book about the President written by Rush Limbaugh? Maybe, but with a healthy level of skepticism.

I figured there was more to the \\"random shooting,\\" but I did not figure it out immediately as frequently happens in films these days. This should have been a bigger hit than it was.

B004SIP9B0|5.0|I enjoyed The Queen a great deal when I saw it as a rental that I decided to purchase it as a blu-ray.  Helen Mirren does an excellent job portraying 'the institution' in crisis; the rest of the cast are no slouches either; the interactions were quite fascinating and seemed real, even if they might not have been.  Between the Queen and 'call me Tony' Blair, Prince Charles, and Prince Philip, even the small exhibition of coldness between the Princes Philip and Charles near the end, all well done.  The extras on the disc, particularly the commentary, was enjoyable to me as well.
0140157352|5.0|A little planning and preparation, plus the techniques from this book, will dramatically improve your negotiations, regardless of the style or tactics of the other party. Solid advice that can be applied at home and in business.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Pretty much everything I wrote for the Season One blu-ray could apply to this product, the Season Two blu-ray.  Cumberbatch's Sherlock and Freeman's Dr Watson still have great interplay and show gradual growth -with some bumps here and there- in their (platonic) relationship, the production values on each episode and on the disc itself are still solid.  The modern-day updates to both the time-frame and story as applied to the established Doyle characters provide interesting twists to the viewer (or at least to one viewer - for example, I did NOT see THAT coming in regards to Moriarty).  Yeah, I'm still addicted to Sherlock and I'm still sad I have to wait half a year to find out just how he did *that* and what Dr Watson is going to do once he finds out.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Greats read.  Very &#34;out of the box&#34;. Makes you feel lucky to be whole and feel for one who has been and isn't any longer.
B004132I20|5.0|I'll admit I could be biased as I am addicted to Sherlock.  I blame Benedict Cumberbatch's riveting (to me) turn as 'John Harrison' in Star Trek: Into Darkness; before that I just didn't 'get' the Cumberbatch fandom at all.  Once I watched the dude in motion up on the big screen, it all became clear though: the man has magnetism and oodles of talent that just doesn't come through in photographs.  So I sought out Sherlock and now I curse the long delay until Season Three airs in the U.S.  As far as the blu-ray itself - the Season One disc is of great quality; the movie-like quality of each episode comes through crystal clear in both picture and sound.  The extra tidbit, the unaired pilot episode, provides an interesting contrast to the revised full-length feature that became Episode 1.  As far as the actual content goes, regardless of the script, set direction, camera work, and soundtrack, Sherlock wouldn't be so terrific if the acting was crap.  Fortunately it isn't (again, in my personal opinion); as Sherlock and Dr Watson, Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman play off well against each other and show excellent character development as the series progresses.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|An unbelievable story of a true Fearless American Hero. Written in a way that allowed me to get to know this man, his family, his courage, and his total and complete commitment to God, Family, and Country. It would have been a huge gift to have known Adam Brown and to have been included as his friend.
B0084FMCI6|5.0|They are extremely comfortable and great for Hawaii living. wear nothing else but my Teva sandals around the island.....love them!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|When I need a distraction this definitely does the trick.<br />It is easy to follow and very fun to play.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It plays like Temple Run. I am not a huge fan of Temple Run but this game is a lot of fun.  Great graphics + addicting game play = hours of fun.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I used to give this game five stars but after I did an update I lost everything all of my coins,keys,boards,and characters I had to start all over the only thing that was saved was my high score my kids were very upset we just started over I just hope it doesn't happen again
140006922X|5.0|One of the best examinations of the historical Jesus that I've read. As the product of a Jesuit education, I have a deep appreciation for scholarly - as opposed to worshipful or hagiographical - histories and analyses of the roots of major faiths.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I liked the twists in the story and how things were explained to make sense.  A little long but I enjoyed it.
B000SEH80I|4.0|I've been reading this book ever since I got it and love it. It has really helped me understand why I have certain troubles. Must read if you have/had toxic parents.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Brilliantly simple but profound. This book, no doubt, will change (or maybe even save) my life.  I have  fasted one day and have already noticed positive changes happening.  I am eating less automatically on non-fasting days.  I am more in tune with my hunger and satiety.  I do not fear being hungry anymore.  I am automatically making healthier meal choices on non-fasting days.  I am in this thing for life.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|It's a fast read, and enjoyable if you can look past aspects.  I could not.  What do I mean?<br /><br />You know how some people read Twilight and (other issues aside) were totally cool with a 117 year old boy dating a teenage girl?<br /><br />This book has a similar relationship.  And this time the centigenarian involved used to date the protagonist's dead relative.  And I just couldn't read it without wondering why *everyone in the book* wasn't upset by this.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I ordered this because I thought my 9 year-old daughter would enjoy it. Turns out, she loved it. She has her mom's goofy humor gene.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|great game to keep you busy for hours of fun.Great for little ones also.down load to day and start your reef
B006AZZPCM|2.0|Downloaded this App and it worked fine copying a couple of films to my kindle, but when I tried to exit from YouTube I had to wait, and wait, and wait...then I started pressing the home icon to go back to kindle homepage. What happened next..? Every time I tried to access internet I got the same frozen screen stuck on YouTube.<br />Had to completely remove the App and reboot the kindle... tubemate seems more UNkindle to me...
140006922X|5.0|Outstanding effort, Fair and balanced, what more can one ask for. Must read. Great read for the summer. Might as well learn something
B00992CF6W|5.0|Why I think minecraft is awesome is because that you make  your adventure<br />And on creative you can build what you want yay
B003L77GH4|5.0|I watched this because my sister told me it was great! And she was right!! I am hooked!! I cannot wait for the next season!
B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|Michael Lewis has the incredible ability to explain extremely complex concepts to the simple man.  He also has a gift for weaving an incredible tale of characters and important time based landmarks to help connect the reader.  5 stars, one of the best books I have read in years.
1451627297|4.0|The condition wasn't the greatest, but it's certainly readable.  I guess because it's a soft cover book, it doesn't take wear as well as a hard cover book.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A LOT OF ACTION.  HE  CREATED AN AMERICAN HERO. SAD IN A WAY THAT JACK'S BROTHER IS KILLED. WOULD HAVE LIKED TO FIND THEM WORKING TOGETHER ON ONE CASE AT LEAST. GREAT MILITARY DETAIL
0738711500|4.0|I've read numerous tarot books but this one is by far one of the best written books on the subject.  I recommend this one to all beginners.  I've been reading for a while now and I found this book to enhance what I already knew.  I just wish the quality of the cards were better.  These are very thin and flimsy. This is my second time buying this deck because I absolutely love the art work but dislike the quality of the cards.
B00CDY6HW6|2.0|not my type of game. got it when it was free. the interaction is ok but could be improved. the graphics are basic, felt like the rabbits were a crude gif animation
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This was a good adaptation from a very difficult book. Would agree that there were areas in the flic that needed cleaner audio. Had to go back and turn on caps a couple of times to make sure I got the conversation.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I had no idea what the book was about, but I thought the movie might help my son become interested in reading it.  So I bought the movie my son's 10th birthday (his grandma had purchased the book, but we hadn't started it yet).  At the movie's end, when we came upstairs for bed, he was holding the book, wiggling his eyebrows like he wanted to read it.  Great, mission accomplished!  My daughter--who's 6--was a little too young for this movie though.  She was traumatized by the goat getting eaten, the boat sinking and his family perishing, as well as the whole concept that this poor kid was trying to co-habitate a boat with a wild carnivorous animal.  She didn't have nightmares, but I don't think she'll be clamoring to see it again anytime soon
B00821PCJS|4.0|Can't believe this is a TV show. Great work with the visuals. The story line is constantly moving and leaving things open without being predictable too much.
B001KOFH2G|4.0|After finishing the series I was eager to get more and more of the shows elegance and fun loving crew onto my TV. After the first watch through I'd say I was surprisingly unimpressed. Not with the quality of the movie and the amazingly spiced up special effects that such a Hollywood budget was given to Joss Whedon for his finale romp through the black. I was more unimpressed with the whole ending of it all. I'm still unclear as how this movie holds out alone and thats probably why it didn't get the numbers the execs wanted, but the movie with the show is an exceptional piece of sci fi all worth the small amount it's been on our radar.<br /><br />***SPOILER*** It truly does have a finally and an ending, especially when some key characters are no longer with us. That's the part that really irked me. As if and yes we all knew, Joss including more than anyone that there'll be no more Firefly, hence Serenity was the truthful end. That was the part that just made me unsettled. The movie it self has a well thought out premise and defiantly leads you in with learning more about the Firefly history. The last tid bit of the film does feel rushed, like I stated people just start falling down left an right. I am understanding the reasoning behind it, the peril that they where against is truly imminent and the notion that the crew was getting picked off like fleas made the action and the situation that much more real. I'd love to see a continuation of the Firefly series, perhaps with a different crew or a new method, but then again a new crew probably would grasp me into this universe as much as the true crew has done. That's what made me love this series, the people and their interactions. How everyone does play a role, whether small like a machinist or large like a captain. All pieces of the story are fun and awesome to watch. I do love that this was a show and a movie combined that I was able to experience. It's a great show and a great story.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Could not put this book down.... Author certainly knows how to keep your interest with his excellent writing and character involvement. - Cannot wait for the next book in this series !!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The first of what will be a long and very interesting story. I found the magic, history, and world fascinating. I can't wait for the next book!
B00063EMJ6|5.0|It came so quickly, I was excited to get it. It was in like new condition, no blemishes on case or cd.
B006S01GH2|4.0|I really like this movie. The cinematography to the score. I've been watching it for years. And, much like Amelie, I enjoy putting my hands into things like lentils.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|With his characteristic combination of cutting-edge science and revolutionary history, James Rollins takes readers on another thrill ride in this ninth installment in the Sigma Force series. This time the very fabric of the universe hangs in the balance. Sigma astrophysicists have been tracking the comet IKON as it travels through space, and in an effort to harness and better understand the murky but promising concept of dark energy, they send the IoG satellite through its tail in a space-time venture--a dangerous experiment that could have literally earth-shattering consequences. When the satellite crashes back to Earth, the Sigma team must take immediate action to recover it and to deal with the dark energy within four days--a timetable that is suspected to indicate the end of the world.<br /><br />At the same time, an Italian priest receives a strange object from a friend he believed to be dead, a seemingly posthumous gift that is tied to the legendary Mongolian ruler Ghengis Khan and that depicts the same apocalyptic calendar. The two must join forces to solve a scientifically and historically significant two-part mystery regarding Khan's undiscovered tomb and the exact location of the ill-fated IoG satellite. Their quest takes them to the far reaches of the globe, with much of the action occurring in Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. Sadistic enemies who will stop at nothing to accomplish their own despotic goals threaten the project, and the Sigma operatives, along with their allies, are taxed to their limit as they fight against both corruption and time.<br /><br />As usual, Rollins provides the roller coaster ride and pulsating action that his fans have come to expect and anticipate. Perhaps the most intriguing and alluring aspect of his work is its strong factual basis, as explored in the brief \\"Notes From the Historical Record\\" and \\"Notes From the Scientific Record\\" sections at the beginning of the story and the concluding \\"Author's Note to Readers: Truth or Fiction,\\" in which Rollins refers to the book's main concepts and events and explains the true-life foundation for each. Not designed for the casual reader, \\"The Eye of God\\" cannot be classified as light reading; it deals with hefty and often mind-boggling scientific concepts and detailed historical situations that task readers' comprehension and imagination skills to the max and may necessitate extra research. As such, Rollins' work is best suited to those who enjoy scientific extrapolation and historical musing, with a robust thread of adventure and action--think Indiana Jones meets the Science and History Channels. The outcome, nevertheless, is very rewarding and thought-provoking, and the novel's ending, in particular, proves to be stunning and unexpected and begs consideration. Enter into this other-worldly journey with caution and prepare to be astounded!
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|This is the latest Lois McMaster Bujold I've read, and I found it to be delightful. In this story, Capt. Ivan Vorpatril, who has been portrayed in the previous books as a handsome, amiable dolt, accepts, while on an Ops assignment on Komarr, a quirky, unorthodox assignment from an Impsec weasel friend and finds himself allied by marriage to a Jacksonian Great House, which corresponds roughly to a Mafia family or maybe the DeMedicis or the Borgias, and has to balance his duties to Barrayar and his new family. And we get to see that there is more to him than anyone ever expected--including Ivan himself. The book is rife with action and witty dialog. If you liked the other books set in this milieu, you should like this one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|There is so much I loved about this book, I don't know where to begin.  I was hooked from the very beginning.  The writing style is compelling and I could not get to the next page fast enough.  I became invested in both the husband and wife characters in this portrait of a marriage going south.  The author nails the ending, which makes &#34;Gone Girl&#34; an absollute success from start to finish.
0316069434|5.0|Harry Bosch embodies the soul of every detective.  I have met and known many.  When I started to read my first Bosch mystery, I put it down, went to the book store and bought paperbacks of all previous Bosch novels.  I read every one of them.  MIchael Connelly is the best mystery novel writer.
B00B81B0HC|4.0|Of course Radioactive has been the big hit from this album, but if you really listen there is some good music here.  The more and more times I listen,  I end up liking it more.  Either a light song or a song with a lot of thought, this has it.  This album just feels good.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Was like watching the genesis of The Office or Dilbert.  Well worth the money and highly recommend for anyone who has worked or will work in a bureaucracy.
B00170MYIS|5.0|I was told that these batteries were no longer being manufactured and had to buy a new camera. If I had only known to look for them here it would have saved me hundreds of $$$
B00E4W40C4|5.0|The Wolverine is an excellent movie.  We see The Wolverine that we wanted to see, while not making it rated R.  Do not look at this movie negatively do to X-Men Origins: Wolverine (which I still do not see what everyone's problem was with that, it wasn't great, but it wasn't awful).  And in all seriousness, this movie deserves to be seen in theaters.  Hugh Jackman was amazing, and in my opinion this is the best Wolverine yet.  Go see it in theaters!
B002ZM74Y6|2.0|I watched less than half of the movie.  Every sentence has more than one F-word. So recommend for those who are more tolerant than I am.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Translating a real-world experience to a computer game is fraught with traps and pitfalls like trying to turn a book into a movie but in this instance I think the result is a good representation of the source material.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very handy to have  easy to use  is right there when you need it  everyone should have this app great for young children
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great quality programming for sure.  Gives me more time to get other things done around the house! A real good idea.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|An interesting look at the times that created Jesus as an historical figure in juxtaposition to what we understand of him as a religious figure from sacred texts. It is the sort of thinking critical to understanding the life of Jesus whether or not you are a Christian.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|An absolute must read! A great tool to stop many marriage problems. Should be a required reeding before everyone gets married.
1905236042|5.0|Got this many years ago for my toddler.  I can't count how many times they have gone to school, or to a friends house.  Everyone loves replicating the poses.  Many years later my pre-teen got them out the other day and I found her and 3 friends doing yoga together.  Great product that has held up well and kept her interest over the years.
014241011X|5.0|I absolutely love this book! i could not put it down. i keep reading it over and over and it doesn't get old.
B0027MJU00|3.0|The author has a vivid imagination with the ability to keep the reader involved in the characters' motivations, but the extreme sordidness of everything, the hopelessness, frustration and despair was difficult for me to bear.  Although these feelings did not stop me from wanting to finish the story.  And, it is certainly a gifted writer who is capable of evoking compassion for her characters born into such unfortunate  circumstances.
B00015YVD6|4.0|Watched this movie many, many years ago. Still as funny as it was the first time I saw it.  Would definitely recommend to all age groups.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Probably can't say anymore than everyone else has said about this.  Very worth the price and we'll certainly go back and watch the season all over again before Season 4.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|A weird, confusing, tangled mess. Great cast, but the story goes nowhere... it's quite hard to sit through. I could only make it about half way before I finally gave up and stopped watching.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Watched on a flight back home and laughed out loud more than once.  It's more of the same that you see from these guys but it was still good and I could relate a lot to what they were going through.  Worth the cost of rental.
B00005QEO1|5.0|This has to be one of Aerosmith's finest albums and I am so hapy that I made this purchase.  Thanks much!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I chose a rating of five stars because I couldn't give it ten stars.  This story really touched me.  I bought two more copies of it not more than an hour ago at B&N.  One for my son, who is a Sgt 1st. Class in the Army, and one for a friend. I was also in the Navy and at one time stationed at Coronado, Calif.  I've been familiar with SEALS for many years. Adam Brown truly was one of America's finest.  It is a shame that we lost him and so many other great young men.<br />  There is nothing about this story or its presentation that I didn't like.  If you possess one ounce of compassion you'll choke up over his loss.  This is a story, not only about heroism, but of dedication, faith, guts, and love.<br />  I would compare this with Chris Kyle's &#34;American Sniper&#34; only to the extent of SEAL operations.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|I have the sample free version and I am having trouble putting it down.  I may buy the full version when I run out of free play.  This game takes the game of golf solitaire and pus you on the course. I recommend.it for at least a try.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This movie kept me glued to my seat.  I don't care to much for a lot of rough action, that is my husband's thing.  But this was the one movie that we both enjoyed together.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This was exactly what I expected.  I purchased it knowing it was used-like new and it was exactly just like advertised.  It plays wonderfully, no scratches, no flaws in any way.  I love my DVD and will not hesitate to order from you again.  I am 100% satisfied  Thank You.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|There were moments when the movie seem to move into action a little bit slowly and this caused a little boredom for me.  But, because I am a big Disney fan, a Love all Disney movies.
B00B04NJI0|1.0|What a waste of Money.  it is in poor taste, and very badly filmed and acted.  my copy went in the trash can, literally.  I would give it a -5 if I could.  I did not finish watching this DVD, it went in the trash can around the letter J or so.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game!!!!! I'm hooked!!!! This app is not a waste unlike some!!!! You should buy this app!!!! Great game!!!!
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|This game is fun it reminds me of Gotham city imposters its a little hard to control but its still fun because its like a cartoon! :D
B005544TRQ|5.0|Awesome show .. keeps me interesting and thinking.<br />i will recommend this show all my friends. Great cast.<br />Must watch...
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|i like  this game but maybe you should try making it a little bit more challenging and realistic but other than that it  great!!!
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|The twists in this film are not so obvious, you think it might be and it's not. Don't want to give it away.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|In the beginning when you first get on it takes a while to load but other than that it's fun.
B0068THAGY|5.0|great movie good story line great action good cast well acted real emotion good ending two thumbs up well done
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I found this to be no help at all. If it weren't grouped together it would be different. Trying to remember all the hints given for different levels. It's impossible to remember the hints for the level you're on
B009O07NDY|5.0|Love it! Fast service and arrived just as expected. Only thing that could have been better is if it came with the Blu Ray / Dvd.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is so much fun! It's great! Definitely an excellent download! I really enjoy the newest version, the lair is the most fun!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is very cool. I have the PC game. I love this game. Can you add caves,and hunger. I don't care for much of the other stuff. Goog game
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Lee Child writes like I watch a movie. Lots of attention to detail and lots of detail, and often in slow motion. Child writes like I want it to happen.
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|bad bad bad movie, must all movie stars use bad words all through out the movie? I am sick of it!
0131101633|4.0|Many years ago, I practically memorized this little book. This was the seminal definition of the C language. It is still (even the old edition) a great introduction to the language. It is well written and surprisingly accessible, given the rather cryptic nature of the C language. I still find myself grabbing this book (1978 edition) first if I have a question. The only caution is that the C language has added some capabilities since this was first written, so you may find that some aspects of the language are not covered here. It also does not really deal with the standard libraries. The later versions of the book may have expanded and updated the coverage.
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|This is a great steampunk series that features werewolves, vampires, ghosts, and one souless woman with a dangerous parasol. Lots of fun, mysterious, windy plot twists.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|\\"The circus arrives without warning.\\" It's open from dark to dawn, and the only colors are black, white, and grey. You will meet a large and varied cast in this tale that begins in 1873 and ends elsewhen. The marvelous characters you will encounter are many and varied. Celia, the illusionist whose magic is real, is in a contest with Marco in a competition arranged by their mentors, and you will be introduced to clockmakers, engineers, fashion designers, a contortionist, a card reader, and many more. There are also two red-headed twins, one of each sex, and Bailey, the young man from Concord, MA, who wants to join the circus.<br /><br />If steam punk can be fantasy, then that's what awaits you. It's also a tale of suspense and, oh yes, a love story.<br /><br />It is told mostly in the present tense, with some tricky second-person segments, too. Hard to do, those; but Ms. Morgenstern manages it very well. It jumps back and forth in time, but the short chapters tell you where you are and what year it is, so be not afraid. Since the word \\"awesome,\\" which would describe this so well, has become a clich&eacute;, call it breathtaking.<br /><br />So do not pass it by.
B0040QYROK|4.0|A must-have for any classic movie buff. Way ahead of its time. Even modern movie-goers will appreciate its cinematic beauty.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|If you are of the Christian faith, read the book, it will pleasantly surprise you on adding the context of this historical extraordinary individual and the birth of a fundamentally radical perspective of the human condition.<br /><br />If you are an atheist, read the book, it will pleasantly surprise you in understanding how this radical and progressive ideology developed from the humblest of sources.<br /><br />In the end, just read with an open mind and you might be surprised what new ideas might sprout in your mind.
B0037W68F4|1.0|this cd sounds nothing like their original and current work. it was a total waste of ten bucks. do not buy if youre a fan of orac spec
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|PerhapsI have become jaded with Mr. Hole, but this lately released first in the series seems formulaic to me. As always, Harry is sober, Harry has a fight, Harry gets blind drunk, Harry hurts someone close to him. (Trying not to give out any spoilers.)  Very interesting information about Australia, makes reading the book worthwhile.
6303257801|5.0|I Chose This Rating Because it Fits The Movie ...... Certainly Was an Early Horror Movie For It's Time. More of Her Movies Please !
B000HL2J0G|3.0|Wife made me watch it, she always loved Dean Anderson. I always thought it was kind of lame.<br />Not much research on the mechanical workings of the show. But what do I know, he's handsome .<br />I've got to go NCIS is on !!!
B0028OF7TA|5.0|This product is great! The songs are great, the shipping was great and it arrived in perfect condition.  Also, I'm so happy with how fast it got here!  This collection is a must buy for any Michael Jackson fans!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everything about this series is top notch.  This series is so engrossing, you will find yourself wanting to watch episode after episode.  It's nice to have the DVDs, so I can go back and watch earlier episodes and catch some of the things that I missed the first time.
B00192IV9U|5.0|Great songs!! Michael Jackson is a musical legend!  Great album with songs that are catchy and creative!  I listen to it all the time!  It's a must buy for the MJ fans!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun and smooth game! Perfect for summer and the weekends. I highly recommend this game; fun for all ages.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I found 11/22/63 a book that was &#34;hard to put down.&#34;  Although there were parts that seemed to slow the story down with too many details, all in all it was a great story.  It had a lot of action plus a good romance and most of the time I was caught up in the book anxious to find the next devopment.
B00CEF014E|5.0|This really needs to be a movie!! The whole time I'm reading it I'm picturing it in a movie form. Even knowing how it'd turn out I'd love to see it! I love all of the plot twists and the flow of it all. So great and really could not put it down. Really! I sat here and read the entire thing without even thinking twice. Amazing read from start to finish. Damian Stevenson is an incredible storyteller. Excellent writing, feels like you are in the book with the characters. It kept me on my toes and read for more. Creepy and thrilling. Just enough to keep you turning the page again and again. I give this book two thumbs up and look forward to reading more books written by Mr Stevenson. A must read!
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|In Bunny Mania 2, you lead a group of bunnies home by altering the path and assigning tasks to bunnies.  You shape the path to overcome obstacles, avoid dangers, and pick up items such as vegetables, thereby earning up to 3 stars.  There currently are 4 worlds, each with 15 levels that must be completed in sequential order.  You unlock each of the additional three worlds by collecting a certain number of stars.<br /><br />The game features good graphics, decent sound effects and music, and thoughtful graphical tutorials plus an excellent documentation page.  It even has a hint system that helps you choose the path and tasks.  As an adult, I found out the game play to be a little slow and slightly challenging.  However, my nine-year-old will find it fun and challenging, and will likely play it for hours.  I suspect his age group is the right target demographic for this game.<br /><br />Of course, one of my favorite features is the complete lack of permissions, ads, or nags.  Absolutely no in-app purchasing and no spyware. :D  Hooray!<br /><br />This looks and feels like a professional app.  It also seems worth the price of it keeps my son entertained (and training critical mental skills at the same time) during extended periods of waiting.
B005CRQ3IE|4.0|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,while not as interesting as Qudditch Through the Ages or The Tales of Beedle the Bard is still a good supplemental book for Harry Potter fans. We get a look at the history of defining beasts, the methods of concealing beats muggles are not to see and a pretty good description of each beast. These descriptions all include an x rating of 1-5 to show how dangerous they are. But the most entertaining part of the book is the notes and markings made by Harry and his friends. (Especially the comments about Hagrid.) This book is for serious Harry Potter fans and is a great read for it's intended audience. 4 out of 5 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My children love this game.  The graphics are great and it isn't too easy or too hard.  This is one of the best apps I've downloaded so far.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|Hard to get into need to watch twice! If you want to get it, don't know if I can,,,we will see
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a nice little game. My 5 year old daughter is loving it. Only negative is that some things take too much time and waiting to complete and also the graphics get laggy.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Ha sido increíble descubrir a Ruiz Zafon a través de este hermoso libro. uno quisiera que continuara y continuara... :)
B009C7JS14|5.0|This app is easy to use and has everything you need to start your day. It is compact and easy on the eyes. I recommend it.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|This is a good case if I could get my husband to put his earpiece in it when not in use.  We spend a lot of time hunting for the earpiece.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I was so happy when I was able to find this and get it as a gift for our daughter in law. She so enjoyed the series. It was a wonderful surprise for her.
0142410314|5.0|We have not read it yet since it is part of the reading curriculum for third grade which starts in a couple of weeks.
B00000J048|5.0|This was a marvelous toy for our grandson and will be for his little brother. our grandson enjoys the various ways you can build this and plays with it cranking the gears. Even his baby brother notices as the wheels turn around
B008BQ8YHQ|3.0|Although this show originally aired on USA, it would fit better under TNT's &#34;we know drama&#34; tagline. The characters are likable, but the crazy (and dramatic) turns make for a sometimes unsatisfying ~hour of entertainment.
B00CM1S1QK|5.0|I've had trouble with Real Gone Jazz disc quality in the past so I used Nero to check disc quality and all were fine. Are far as I could tell these albums are from CD sources and the sound quality is fine in my opinion. The albums At Newport and At The Village Gate offer the original album tracks, without the extra tracks found on the Westside release WESD 210 that I already own. The music, predominantly chamber jazz, is superb throughout and thoroughly recommended.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Can`t believe this was FULL version, NO ad's, FAOTD! Wish they were all like this, graphics wonderful and game itself AWESOME. Thanks so much for the fun!  Keep the free ones coming!
B009UZLRJE|5.0|It is great!!!  I love the show and the Blu-ray experience enhances it.  I watched all of the episodes and now I started over...
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I was happy with the app before the recent changes. I've always believed, &quot;if it isn't broke DON'T fix it!&quot;<br />The overall page is more vibrant. I have to remember to look for the hourly differently than before. I was generous with four stars because of the vibrancy.
B003B02O0U|4.0|I liked the heroine since she was young and beautiful and managed to stay alive despite all of<br />the ongoing threats against her.  I would recommend this book since it keeps you turning the<br />page.  The plot and the story seem well thought out.  Never a dull moment!<br />007
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Great special effects, amazing how far they've come. Don't know how much farther they can extend these movies but always a good movie to watch.
B001PJRAUS|3.0|I'm a sucker for costume films, and with a twist like this, I was prepared to dig in.  It was too stagey for my taste, including the lead.  She was so sparkle-eyed, Lassie could've played her part.  Still, the idea is terrific.  Maybe someone will take it on and do a better job.
B00005AWMF|4.0|Thought more of my favorites would be on the CD but overall okThe sound quality ie very good.Words to songs should be larger print for easier reading.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|My previous headphones stopped working I needed a new pair. After doing extensive reviews on headphones within my budget, I came across these, which had high ratings not just in Amazon but on other websites as well, and they have lived up to their billing. They aren't 100% noise cancelling but they kept enough 'outside' sound out while having amazing in-ear sound. Recommended.
B0000013G9|4.0|Good Upbeat sounds and various tempos makes for a good mix.  I choose it for one particular song but the other songs make for good listening as well.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|another beautifully writen poignant insight into afghani culture. I only hope it goes some way to dispelling refuge myths and facilitatimg help and understanding.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|This movie is a classic . I loved the way Robert Redford potrayed Gatsby such a great actor. It's by far the best in my opinion of all the movies that have been made .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun for everyone in the family.  Kids and adults all enjoy<br /> playing. Great graphics, easy for anyone to play.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|It has everything in it related to the series. And the booklet that comes with it is the best, it has comments on some of the episodes. :)
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I like this app a lot but it has this one big glitch for me it freezes a million time during a video.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I just started playing it and it seems rather entertaining. If you like challenging your mind and and think of your self as someone rather smart, you'll enjoy this puzzle game
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the nest running game ever! The graphics r really good! It has more obstacles so it's more challenging! So addicting! Awesome game! U have 2 get it!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|wonderful game for the kids ,ooops and me to, i hate all these ads in between games though which can be irritating for the five year old but avoidable with the adult
0743270754|5.0|Took me a long time to plow through Team of Rivals but it is well worth the time.  Learned a great deal of Lincoln's early life and hated to have the book end.  A book to keep on your book shelf.
B003INBOEM|5.0|hi donnie plays a great part in this film this is not a film just for the kung fu fanatic it is for everyone absolutley great
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|If you seek inspiration, have lost a job, lost a loved one, feel like you are a hamster on a wheel or simply just keep telling yourself &#34;someday maybe...&#34; - this book is for you.  James Altucher is a master story teller and innovative motivator.  This is not your typical self help or business book.  It is a quantum leap in thinking about your life and how you go about it.  Enjoy!
B004I11VZA|5.0|hi i think this sequel to the first ipman is just as good,very well told story and full of action just what you want
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I loved this movie despite the body-function humor. The hotel lobby scenes with all the various monsters are hilarious. The characters are very relate-able- and over-protective vampire Dad, laid-back human as the potential boy friend,  cute daughter so anxious to see the world. And the &#34;inside&#34; jokes about the horror monsters is funny.
B00797MB0O|3.0|It's really not.  Elements of the movie have a dark humor to them, but I think the disconnect for me was between what was advertised in the trailer (rom-com) and what I got (dark commentary on the decline of humanity), which wasn't really what I was looking for when I watched it.  Charlize Theron's performance is very good and the movie somehow avoids feeling formulaic, but there's something inherently depressing about the not-very-good people that make up the primary protagonists.  I think it's a good film even if I didn't like it - just be aware of what you're going to get when you watch it so you're in the right mindset.
B00DJXSKWU|1.0|I downloaded this game,it won't play right side up,every time I start this game it flips around, and stalls. I want my money back.refund please.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|This classic show is the GRoddenbury gem that created an empire in an out of space. I watched FLASH GORDON as a kid and love watching this campy space drama with Kirk et crew makes my superficial side deliriously happy from time to time! Enjoy!
B00DGKQF2S|4.0|this is a solid effort from some real pros. richie's chops are everything reviewers are saying about them and billy is billy... who's better?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is just flawless from start to finish. Loved every minute of it. Best book I've read in a while.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This was a good book, but it was a little hard to keep track of the different storylines. It seemed like it jumped from one to the other (in chapters) and I had to figure out which one it was each time
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|i DID NOT FEEL THAT IT WAS USER FRIENDLY.  i DELETED IT.i WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED.THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO SAY.
140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan is a scholar who writes effectively about world religions.  His newest effort is well worth reading, as it pays attention to the political climate of Jesus' culture and his struggle against Roman oppression.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the life and times of Jesus. Well done, Dr. Aslan.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|First time setting-up KindleFire and thought I was setting up the actual game. Dont need Help guide, but Thanx. anyway.
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|Great album! So glad to have Marc Anthony back where he belongs singing Salsa tunes with passion and pride...can't wait to see his concert...musica latina...boriqua!
140006922X|5.0|Fantastic! If the anti-intellectual crowd is against this, you should be for it! Aslan presents FACTS! Open those minds and bask in the warmth of researched positions!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|My 9 yr old son loves this game. I also like this game. It is fun to play all day.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I enjoy reading all his books, still just getting into his latest book, but enjoying it as I<br />do all his stories.. Welcome again to re visit his regular characters.. Join the story,.<br />read the books..  All of his books capture your attention.. 1st book to present..
B004KA9VGA|5.0|I am really happy this book has another two to follow as did not want for the story to end.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Before they updated the app it worked really well. Now that they  updated it, it is  really slow to load and annoying with the achievement points you earn. Really wish they would have just left it alone.
B00D0SEGMC|1.0|I have spent way too much time trying to figure out how to use this product. It is not user friendly and I never could set a destination or search for a location. I would not recommend this to anyone, I wasted my money.
B004I744AS|5.0|it is perfect for my needs. It gives me the meaning, the pronounce and sentences with the word you are looking for. And for free.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A Heart-achingly beautiful rendition of the memory of navigating childhood with all it's wonder, magic, wisdom, and fear.  To truly remember childhood is to once again glimpse the magic of the universe.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I enjoyed Eben's story about his experience with the afterlife.  His story was compelling and quite believable because of his medical experience.  He included lots of background and history that kept me, the reader, informed and not guessing.<br /><br />I read this as an Ebook on my Kindle.  There was less reading than I expected because about 20% of the book is dedicated to acknowledgements and references.  The reference list was extensive and I will use it to choose other books to read on this topic.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|very fun game, love the new lands that are constantly being updated. much better than original temple run in my opinion.
B00AOQ8MOQ|4.0|I love the movie but the screen was all stretched out (up/down). I have a regular HD widescreen TV, no idea why it looked weird,
0316228532|4.0|I thought this book was interesting and very entertaining. However there are some disturbing scenes and mature themes so if you are not expecting something very different from harry potter watch out!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|this was not my favorite Hosseini book.  it was difficult to follow and left many loose ends.  as always, the characters were well drawn and appealing, but the plot took too many twists to track easily.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great app with lots of customizable options- I really love both the daily and weekly challenges - keeps it interesting!!!
1444737090|5.0|Read this in one day - almost brought tears to my eyes. Very touching and a great story. Highly recommended - especially if you're a cat lover and know what awesome creatures they are. Long live Bob!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The gameplay is simple but satisfying, and the upgrades keep individual games from getting boring. I recommend this to anyone with kids.
B001QJUX24|5.0|This was required viewing for a grad course at my university, and it was very convenient to buy it on Amazon and watch it on my PC. I was also able to stream it on my laptop during the class discussion and go over the scenes being discussed. A great experience and the price was simply superb. You can;t buy a cup of coffee for what Amazon charges to view a movie these days.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is the best series in 2013.  We started watching this later than most but we are quickly catching up thanks to Amazon Prime.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|Now I'm not normally one to buy albums. I think albums are kinda boring and contain songs that weren't released as singles because they sucked. I was however, very impressed with this album. If you love to dance this is defainately the album for you! Sorry for spelling that word wrong! Here's what I think about each song.<br /><br />1)Birthday:There is some weird moaning at the beginning but it's fun to dance too. I felt the lyrics were a little weird. \\"Come and meet the queen, taking cream\\". And they were also repetitive were in one verse she would say \\"Falling in to you, falling in to me\\" then \\"Crashing in to you crashing into me\\" in the other. There was no real bridge and I did get tired of her saying \\"Tell em' that it's my birthday.\\"<br /><br />2)Slow Down: The most fun to dance too. It has dance beats all over the place and experiments with some dubstep. I like when she goes \\"Woooo oh oh oh \\" It's all auto-tuned but isn't most pop music. It makes it more fun to dance Too anyway.<br /><br />3)Stars Dance: There is something magical about this song. It's very whimsical and you'll feel like your floating on a cloud or something. You can't really dance to it but it has a catchy chorus. The best part was the bridge where she sings \\"Everything I touch turns to love, everything I do will open up heaven.\\" I don't really get the guy yelling \\"Wahhh\\" at the beginning and the end.<br /><br />4)Like A Champion: Also not very dancy either. Here Selena tries to imitate a like Rihanna accent. It kinda reminds me of a song the girls of ANTM Cycle 19 would sing cuz they went to Jamaica in it but the only line I really like is when she says \\"Never felt so sexy, sexy, sexy\\"<br /><br />5)Come & Get It: I've heard this song way to many times but I'm tired of listening to it for maybe another few months. But all in that. It's an amazing song!<br /><br />6)Forget Forever: This song is fun to sing with and there's really awesome part where you think the song is slowing down and she sings very slowly and then she gets very loud. You can't dance to it either but I won't forget it forever!<br /><br />7) Save the Day: It feels like one of those Mexican bands I know what it's called mareeachee there I spelt it like it sounds. You'll feel like you just went to Spain after listening to it.<br /><br />8) B.E.A.T: MY FAVORITE. I love the whole sexy autotune in the beginning. Ay yoooooooo. The bridge is so amazing cuz it's dubstep and you'll feel like a robot because it goes slows and than speeds up. Oh my gosh it it just so much fun to dance too. I don't know why anybody would complain about this song.<br /><br />9) Write Your Name: It's very boring! I can't past the beginning part because it's so slow. She says \\"Write Your Name\\" way too many times. The song just doesn't go anywhere. Uhhh it sucks if she performs it live I'll fall asleep.<br /><br />10) Undercover: Hummm. It's ok. The lyrics are kinda cheesy. \\"Your a sexy machine, your a Hollywood dream, and you make me feel like a homecoming queen.\\" I like the \\"find me in the shadows\\" verse. I think you could dance to it and it's kinda fun to sing too but it's not like catchy like \\"Naturally\\" or \\"Love You Like A Love Song\\"<br /><br />11) Love Will Remember: It's a nice sweet ballad. Again the bridge is amazing. \\"Break down the walls, let heaven in, somewhere in forever will dance again.\\" Amazing! They should've kept Justin Bieber's track in the beginning.
B003O86FMW|5.0|First book that I have literally had a hard time putting down. You will finish it in no time. Buying Mockingjay tonight so I can continue reading this epic tale!
B0083GQVOC|4.0|Having read the book first, the movie makes much more sense. Having said that, this is a great suspenseful ride.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|the storyline is engaging, heart wrenching, sweet, touching and dramatic.  I do have my problems with some of the situations, (Thomas being accepted as a homosexual valet, while an ex-prostitute serving dinner to the ladies is scandalous. I have no problem that Thomas IS homosexual, but felt story could have been used to show a more realistic life of one in the early 1900's)<br /><br />However, those mild annoyances aside, I still LOVE the show and can't wait for Season 4!
B00DW39B2K|5.0|It has been many years since John Travolta (and De Niro) have been this good!  The story is good and the overall acting is fantastic!  I highly recommend this movie!
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|Disjointed storyline. They had so many good characters to develop, but chose not to. At least they incorporated the hovercraft and the dune buggy.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I thought it was thrilling and unexpected. It was kind of scary. I couldn't put the book down. I always had to know what happens next. Loved the book
B00BG08FKK|3.0|I love Les Mis and I couldn't even take a guess at how many times I watched the movie, so when I bought the Sound track To listen to at work and in the car I had High hopes.<br /><br />I can't even tell you how excited I was when it finally came in the mail and I opened it and put it in the computer to listen to it, and that's when I was disappointed. the CD cuts a lot of the songs short (even shorter than the movie) and the timing is off on some of the tracks so it will skip to the next track in the middle of a song and if you have it on shuffle that is a problem because then you randomly get the second half of a song at the beginning of the next tract.<br /><br />Looks like I will stick to using my portable dvd player and the Movie any time I want to hear Les Mis because the CD is just too disappointing
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. Um there's almost nothing that I don't like about this book except for when my favorite characters died. I guess anyone who likes action adventure would like this book. :)
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I should have read the other reviews first. Yeah, the game is great - we've got it for PC and DS, and now two copies for my Android tablet. Why two? Because this one is terrible. It is WAY behind on updates. Get this from the Google Play Store if you can. That version is up to date - with the Zen Garden and all the other extras that this version is missing. Plus, the graphics are much better on a tablet with the Play Store version than with this Amazon version.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Great to be able to access all my pictures, files, music, etc from my desk top computer on my tablet.  Love it!
B006YC74E8|5.0|I absolutely love it. Not only was it free, I'm having tons of fun, and it's exactly what I wanted. Lots of options, professional feeling.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Great game!  Very addicting.  Just wish we could see more of the map while we're playing.  Hard to always see where the diamonds are.  Still a fun game that I had trouble putting down.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Who could combine into a better pair than Carole and James- listened to it constantly on my trip, and enjoyed the DVD again as well.
159463176X|2.0|I read and loved both of this author's previous books, which is why I could not wait to buy this one. As another reviewer said early, the book sucked me in initially, but it wasn't long before there were so many different characters and so many different story lines that I couldn't keep any of them straight. There was never enough time to bond with any specific character before we were on to a new story, and I honestly lost track of who was who. And in the end, I was sorry that we didn't find out more about the few characters I did like. I do like the author's writing and will probably buy his next book, but I hope he finds a way to go recapture the style and magic of Kite Runner and Thousand Splendid Suns.
B002XZNHG4|5.0|This movie is timeless!!!  Everyone 18 and older should see this film.  It without a doubt stands the test of time.
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but not as much as the book.  In my minds-eye, Katniss had a lot more going on in her mind than was apparent in the film. She appeared a little &#34;dead behind the eyes&#34; -- and I thought the character in the book read much sharper than she appeared in movie.  Some of my favorite small ideas and scenes from the book did not make the movie (but that is often the case; there's just not time).  I did feel the Hamich character was under-developed in the movie.  His motivations were clearer in the book.  But overall - entertaining!  Look forward to the next one.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Always something happening exciting in every episode.. My husband and I would sit and watch several every night.. Recomment to everyone!
B0054SMID0|4.0|I&#34;m not necessarily a McConaughey fan, but he portrays the smooth operating defense lawyer caught in a bind very well.  Strong cast.  Have watched more than once.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Always something happening exciting in every episode.. My husband and I would sit and watch several every night.. Recomment to everyone!
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Lots of CGI action and petty rivalries among egotistical 'super heroes'.  Movie really strained to give all the different actors something to do.  The ending was predictably over-the-top smash, bang, blow up everything in CGI.  Perhaps great fun for kids, but boring for an adult.
B0086700CM|1.0|You can't control the player.  How are you supposed to survive?  I paid for a useless app.  Not worth it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this app cause I am a fan of puzzle games such as this one. Very cool and excellent app.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|The quality is terrible.  Need more instructions on how to use.  Don't want picture of myself but what is in front of me.
B003A166OK|2.0|Had never seen and wanted to, but it wasn't worth the effort.  His character was unengaging and the plot wholly unconvincing.  Wish I had re-watched one of he better movies.  And at this point pretty much any other Western I've seen him in was better!
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This book is as inspiring as it is informative. I've heard much about the hardships in Africa throughout my fortunate education, yet this journey truly enlightens the reader to some of the truth of what the people face. I would recommend this not only to those who wish to learn about Africa, or places less fortunate than there own, but also to those who really want to take perspective on their own life. Those who don't truly understand all that they have been blessed with. I would be reading this book, and be eating, and think to myself &#34;this in front of me could have saved a life.&#34; Truly inspirational.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It is unusual for me to read through a book with such unlikable characters, but thanks to the interesting change of direction in Gone Girl, I stayed till the end. The problem was, when I got to the end, I didn't know it. I actually started looking to see if I was missing some pages. Despite the unsatisfactory ending, it was an easy, entertaining read. I agree: good for the beach.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I had read a few Jo Nesbo books and decided to go back to his first.  Very good; would've given it a five star except for his phases where he gets very descriptive of the flora and fauna!  And I have to flip ahead...<br /><br />Bill
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|A mix of modern and classic that brings me back to the classic Kaiju films from Toho studios.  Good energy to the album with both the guitars and bass playing off each other.
B001DUDKEY|3.0|I love anything historical and traditional. Never got totally involved in this movie. Perhaps too many pensive moments where 'looks exchanged', rather than words, were to be interpreted by the viewer. It made some of the scenes drag on a bit too long. I had the urge to scream &#34;come on, say something! DO something! Spit it out!...&#34;.  For a quiet evening's entertainment it's OK.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of those games that starts off fairly simple and grows more and more complex as your proceed through the levels. Some boards I can look at and get the first time around and some boards I struggle with for long periods of time. It really makes you exercise your spatial and analytical thinking skills.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app makes everything so much easy to do the things I need to do especially since I am on Amazon everyday, almost all day!  Amazon is a joy to be associated with period.  They have helped me in more way than I can count.<br /><br />Keep up the good work AMAZON and KINDLE!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Worried at first about the violence but it soon discovered it was nothing to worry about. Fantastic story. Watched it twice in a row.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great book I even read it again right after finishing it the first time , lots of characters that all come together at the end, so the second time I read it I enjoyed even more
0375815260|5.0|I bought this book to read with my daughter, and have been enjoying it for several nights now.<br />The book is a very well made edition. Nice paper and printing; a picture every now and then, to help kids make the transition to no-picture books; nice solid cover; great quality overall...<br />And, most of all, the story is just amazing!
B004132HZS|5.0|I am hooked! I love the actors and the classic story telling. Now I have to purchase season 2 asap.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Seems to be a common theme; guy stumbles into trouble, guy gets girl, guy gets the bad guys and guys moves on (without girl).  I'll see if Lee's story development improves in book 3.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Great characters and hair raising plot. This is a book you can't put down and are satisfied with the end.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I liked it well enough to read his second Jack Reacher book.  Intersting character and stories.<br />I will probably continue to read the rest of the Jack Reacher novel.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I love the Camel Club books and the characters that we meet in the stories. Baldacci does it again with a great political thriller.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The latest update is horrible. If it aint broke dont fix it.  The ads are the worst and most intrusive i have ever seen. Will have to find a new weather app.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|good game. I liked it . My daughter likes it. wanting more levels. waiting for update to come my way
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Yes, I see the irony in writing a review myself on a book I haven't read, but I couldn't stand by and let the anti-intellectual religious zealots hijack the ratings with one star reviews of a book they clearly haven't read.  So un-christian!  I  do plan to read it soon, as I saw the Daily Show and Fox News interviews and it sounds fascinating.  It is not a crime to write about a religious figure from a historical perspective.  I invite others to give 5 star reviews as well to balance the bogus one-stars as long as Amazon is unwilling to do anything to insure the integrity of the reviews on its site, like Yelp has.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Too bad so few episodes were shot; it's one of the funniest television shows ever.  &#34;Fawlty&#34; is brilliant comedy writing.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|This is a great film, If you haven't heard of it already you were probably stranded on an island somewhere for the past few years. Read the books and watch the moves, you'll have a good time
B008JFUREC|4.0|Feeling Blue? Join the exciting adventures of our stalwart crew as they join forces to rescue Smurfette, who knows a secret....<br /><br />The opening credits feature pop-up pages in a child's book. Every child in the screening audience recognized them right away. In fact, other than the toddler who was instantly (and vocally) bored, the rug-rats seemed very involved; they were quiet and well-behaved. These opening credits, by the way, are the only time I felt the 3D was used to any special effect. It's lovely for the travelogue/story that follows, but it does NOT enhance the plot.<br /><br />New Yorkers Patrick and Grace dash off to Paris to help their friends when Smurfette needs to be rescued. To me, the joy was to recognize Montmartre, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs-Élysées, Jardin des Tuileries, and Place de la Concorde, with a few more thrown in for good measure! (Like the ferris wheel that seems to come and go in Paris these days.)<br /><br />We saw:<br />  * Neil Patrick Harris (\\"The Smurfs\\") as Patrick, the Smurfs' Number One friend who helps them when sweet little Smurfette is lured away by the evil wizard's cute henchmen.<br />  * Jayma Mays (\\"The Smurfs\\") is Grace, Patrick's wife, and mother to their four-year-old boy named Blue.<br />  * Hank Azaria (\\"The Smurfs\\") is Gargamel, the evil wizard who needs two things: 1) The Secret Formula, and 2) the \\"Essence\\" of a few Smurfs.<br />  * Brendan Gleeson (\\"The Guard\\") is Victor, Patrick's most UNwelcome step-father, who has all the finesse of a bull in a china shop.<br />  * Katy Perry (Lots of TV) is the voice for Smurfette.<br />  * An amazing Computer Generated cat. Technology wins again!<br /><br />The Smurfs each have their own personalities and are portrayed by \\"name brand\\" actors. I won't go into that here, as there is nothing distinctive to note. You can review their names and characters when you get the DVD from Amazon.<br /><br />The message in this movie is that parents love their adopted children as though they are their own. Not a bad thing...
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|My all time favourite...every time I read it I find it more enjoyable!...!! This is just a classic book. Book is worth reading before watching the movie!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome and its free!! My kid love this game they play it all the time. They are 17-5
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Nice game for Magic enthusiasts.  The card game, not actual magic.  I've only played the campaign thus far, and it has been nice.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is wonderful app.Really helps keep me on point. I love the fact that it synchs across all my devices automatically. Killer app on my Kindle Fire, iMac, HTC One S, etc. Just love it!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book even though I don't usually read books about Jesus or even religion. The way the author tries to frame the history of the man Jesus in time he lived gives some great insight.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Most addictive series I have ever watched. I share in the love, hate, laughter and tears. Thank You to everyone involved in this series for weaving such a great story....
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am a huge fan of this show and literally blew through the whole season in one evening. My only regret is that I didn't draw it out longer so that I could continue to watch it.
B008KEQMDC|4.0|This is a cute chick flick, slightly predictable but just what I wanted to watch as a new mom that could relate to the trials of pregnancy!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I absolutely love this game!  I've had mahjong games on my PC for years and have always enjoyed playing it.  I play it sometimes when I'm wound up about something and it really calms me down and is very soothing.  This app is no different.  I love the serene calming music in the background, which if you don't like, you can always turn the volume down on your kindle.  I do try to see how fast I can do a level and am always try to beat my record, but that's not the most important thing to me.  I also love the fact that you have so many puzzles to choose from, which was the drawback I found in my PC game.  They showed more layouts than were actually available to choose from.  Usually I find an app that I like and play with it for a while and then get rid of to make room for a new one, but I think that this one is definitely a keeper.  Keep it up guys!
B004J4WNL2|3.0|I think the author was seeking validation for being quiet, and I liked that about the book.  I question that the science is there for all the book's claims.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The plot, the characters, the setting, the acting were all superb.  I couldn't stop watching.  I've recommended it to several of my friends.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Even better than first. Can't wait to read the third one. You won't want to put it down once you start reading.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Saw it once in 2 D, then again in 3 D.  It was fantastic both times.  To make a pun, Seeing it in 3 D added a whole new dimension to the movie.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was great. Puts a different perspective on owning a dog and the love that they show us humans.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So fun.A little better than the original, but THE funnest game ever to be created!P.S., this message is to the Amazon appstore, when you post review, can you rate the app 6 stars? BTW, this app was rated on the kids choice awards funnest app.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Exciting until  the very last word.  Was surprised by the death.  Of a main character.  Can.'t wait to see if love story comes next.
B0095VP8D4|4.0|I purchased this to replace the core i3 setup in my media center pc and it works great, no problems recording transcoding and playing back multiple hd streams on a gigabit lan. Stock HSF is really loud so I recommend finding a nice quiet one to replace it.
B008WCP2KG|3.0|This movie was okay. the plot to the movie was very bland. the only reason I saw this movie because gabrieal igleasis is in it and I heard him talk about it in his latest special aloha fluffy. he didn't get that much screen time for his first movie. and the part I wanted to see that he was talking about that he was in was cut out. oh well it happens. matthew was pretty good at his role. this is basically a movie for women who just want to see channing tatum take off his clothes and do some dirty dancing. if your into that than this is a movie for you. but all in all it was okay. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you don't
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Fun game to play,will keep you busy for hours. Game does run a little slow sometimes, shuts down every now and then.
B005HED08I|5.0|Even today it's still great. Today's shows have little content. Everything is marketed to a certain age group vs quality television. This is quality TV.
B004QX07G4|5.0|My Mom loves Ellen, She had to have this bbok and all the rest too, I got a lot more to send!!!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Author should have stopped with Book One.  Book Two was a bit of a stretch, lacking any substance and only served to diminish the novelty of Book One.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|The film itself is not extremely exciting, but the acting is top notch, jack Lemmon, Alex Baldwin, and Ed Harris being my standouts.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Don't even bother reading this.  This was obviously done to ride on the success of Book One but just served to diminish Book One's novelty - more so than Book Two.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I love it, it is great. They are so funny . I love how the talk. If you love One Direction This is a awesome ! I did not get it off of here tho I got it At Target .
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I enjoyed reading Book One - it was an interesting insight to the surrealistic world of dom/sub wrapped in a romantic tone.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a cool game, my game keeps freezing any suggestions to stop it from feezing. I enjoy games like this subway surer was a cool game too. it freez a lot too.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I love Marvel Comic characters. Growing up we only had the comic books. To see them now is very exciting.

B000JMLFLW|4.0|I have to saw I have seen t h e movie and of course the book is more detailed. I found the book a little hard to get into, just trying to understand the language, but I did enjoy the book, have to get another book from her again.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I bought this microphone to record some reviews with the Canon T2i and it worked great - very loud and very sensitive though so make sure you have almost zero background noise, The T2i has a auto boost and it can add some artifacts to your audio recording, I've heard this microphone works better with the T4i but I was able to get the job done.<br /><br />The cord is VERY long so it work great if you need the camera to be farther away from the subject.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is great but some people say that the ten contacts money and that<br />stuff it's fake so don't listen, buy it!
B009P0VLGI|5.0|I received it in a timely fashion, it was in perfect condition as far as the cd and books. The poster (which I had no idea was included, a pleasant surprise) was obviously hung previously so slight damage on the corners was noticed, but I am thoroughly pleased!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun I could play this all day. Best game I have ever played.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this kind of games where you have to build something.<br />The only thing is that you have to wait longer to buy something or expand your territory, but anyway I love it.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Love this movie...made me fall in love with Edward Norton as an actor...it has a great plot twist at the end.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The depth of the book is great!!! I love the ending and how everything is tied into each other. I also it keeps you guessing!!!! A fantastic read!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a great app! I love how easy it is to use and use it daily.<br /><br />I use the percentage applications often.
B009G41CG2|3.0|This is fine, plenty of layout options. I just wish it would let me know when there are no other moves. That is my only complaint.

B002AWX6UM|4.0|Ishmael Beah has succeeded in bringing to light the real impact of violent conflict on real lives. It flows well from start to finish and leaves you wanting to know more about him, the country of Sierra Leone and her people. He vividly describes horrific occurrences, and even manages to throw in some humor that will see one surprisingly laughing.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for anyone interested in understanding the trauma and impact of violent conflict, especially on those who have been 'perpetrators'/ forced to participate. It is also a good read for those who enjoy reading on Africa. I would also recommend it for those working in and on Africa, especially in post-conflict contexts. It clearly demonstrates how easy it is for externally-imposed strategies to flop and fail to meet their intended objectives.
0823015017|4.0|The experiences shared by these two artists is exceptional and they have succeeded in meeting the challenge of transferring what they have learned into a book that can easily be understood by their readers, a daunting undertaking indeed! It has certainly made me much more aware of colour combinations but I am not sure I will follow their detailed path in my efforts as I tend to enjoy a much more serendipitous journey. A good reference book to have in any library though.
0062255657|5.0|A tale that takes you by the hand and leads you on a journey that you would never reach on your own.
0823013626|4.0|Everyone should have at least one of this artist's books in their library! I've got a post it tab on almost every page, highlighting information that I can't wait to experiment with and use in my own work!

B002N44XSG|5.0|I chose this rating cause Percy Jackson is BOSS. I like how Percy's weapon turns into a sword with a click. I would recommend this book to Harry Potter fans. I have read the whole series of Harry Potter and Percy Jackson. Harry and Percy have one thing in common. They both do not know what they are.

B004JHYRP4|5.0|Premise: The Electron Pump is the most revolutionary invention in history, creating free energy through a complicated exchange system with another universe. Only young physicist Lamont begins to believe that the downsides to the Pump might soon outweigh the benefits...<br /><br />This was a great read. It's divided into three sections, which were originally published as (and still work as) separate but interlinked stories. The first part works the best on its own, and I was actually a little disappointed that the story continued; it has such a great, pointed ending.<br /><br />The second section takes place in the parallel universe, focused on an utterly alien, three-gendered race. This was equally fascinating for completely different reasons. The social structure and norms of the aliens are not completely divorced from human culture, but there are tons of intriguing wrinkles. If you're not paying attention, you might miss the allusion to masturbation in the description of one character's experiences growing up, it's subtle. The ways that these characters interact, socially and physically, are really interesting. Dua, the \\"Emotional\\" in the trio the story follows, is the most compelling and sympathetic character, for all that she's single-minded and sometimes shallow.<br /><br />The third section is back in Earth's universe, although it takes place with a new group of characters on the Moon. It's well written, interesting, and enjoyable to read, however it didn't have the same impact as the first two sections. Now, bear in mind, `not having quite the same impact' still places it pretty high up on a list of great works of science fiction. Overall, I found this to be an extremely satisfying book, both to read and to think about later.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|An interesting 'back to the future' read but predictable plot. Love interest was mundane.<br />A few interesting Oswald facts but not really very enlightening beyond that. On the whole, it was pretty boring.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|If you want a funny movie with senseless violence reminiscent of so many of the 80s and 90s action movies, then this is a good one. It will make you nostalgic for your favorite heroes. Not long in plot but that's not really why we watch these movies, is it?
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Good product and nice
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Great, a most read. Character development is great, you can relate to them and see yourself in their shoes. Excellent writing.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This series is spectacular! The cast, period authenticity and scripts are all completely engaging! Most anyone with a love of history and drama should find this series riveting!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Love the adventure, lots of unexpected plot twists!! George R. R.<br />Martin is a genius. The mix of characters makes this series come to life.
B00B19DW0E|3.0|A typical 80's far fetched Mad Max style action movie. It's not a bad watch if you like that type of style.

0553801473|5.0|Book 5 continues to demonstrate George R. R. Martin's ability to create, develop, and sustain fascinating characters in a consistent world.  While I was not thrilled with the way books 4 and 5 dealt with chronology, I understand and respect the reasons he expressed for breaking the story up that way.  Still working my way through this one (I'm an avid, but not a fast reader), waiting to find out the fate of some of the characters I like best, afraid of the moment when I will find myself finished with Book 5 before Book 6 is published...
B00004HYLF|5.0|Excellent CD. Leans to the Prog side of things. I would recommend listening to it first to verify you like the jazz style.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I've enjoyed all games in this series so far. It's a very simple premise and fun to play. Levels start easy and become more challenging as they go.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this is a very fun app! I love it! the graphics are good and it is very colorful and entertaining.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book helps teens understand and relate to the concepts of cancer and death, which are everywhere. The character of Augustus is a little contrived at times, but overall this is a worthwhile read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really gets your brain running :) you get stuck and need to run through hideings again you should try it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is not a nice, light, easy read. You need to sit down and commit to the story. Once you do, Khaled Hosseini describes a world of deception, misplaced love, and the resilience of the human spirit. It is a story well worth reading.
1401322786|5.0|My daughter is really into this book, which is a required summer reading for her class.  From the beginning she found it very interesting and is enjoying it.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A classic example of how the book is always better than the movie. A light and entertaining read with relatable characters and a smart plot.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|Their harmony is like silk whether it is a ballad or an up tempo song.  Wish they were still together.  Would definitely recommend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A great game for passing the time while setting in the waiting room at the doctors office or tire store.
B0073Q0DZG|4.0|We didn't expect to love this movie as much as we did, but it's a great, happy, sappy movie with funny parts.  Definitely for the middle aged crowd and above.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|As I am not a real gamer, this was not a game of real significance to me, but the grand kids loved it
B00B81B0HC|2.0|There are at most 3 songs worth listening to. After the first few songs, it really goes downhill. There is no consistency or feel to the whole of the album. I wish I would have just purchased the handful of songs and left the filler.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Essential screening to understand the migrations of thousands from the dustbowl  and the working conditions of the migrants..<br />Fonda is phenomenal.  Go back to read the book if you really want the full story

B004JHYRDQ|3.0|Not one of Asimov´s best, yet it´s still an entertaining sci fi novel. I´m a fan of the Foundation Series and there is no point of comparison with those novels.
B00136Q6D0|5.0|This is considered Miles Davis' first fusion and electric period album.  The recording sessions date from 2/18/1969 in New York City.  Wayne Shorter played soprano saxophone along with Davis.  The band also features Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock on electric pianos, Joe Zawinul on organ, John McLaughlin on electric guitar, Dave Holland on bass and Tony Williams on drums.  Producer Teo Macero edited and arranged the recorded material into the two long tracks on the album.  Each track is comprised of three parts, with the third part of each a reprise of the first.  This used to be the best deal on Amazon's website: I bought the MP3 album for a total of $1.98.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a great and fantastic thriller that will have you toe edge of your seat until the end.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Had heard this was a good show and since I only watch internet and not cable I needed something to get hooked on like House of Cards or Homeland.  This was it and am looking forward to more!

B00CATSONE|5.0|Just read this book, and I have never read anything by Sean Patrick before, very inspiring, all it needs now is to be made into a movie and I'm sure it would be a blockbuster. It has everything truth, corruption, greed, faith, sorrow, inspiration. I and proberbly millions of other people would definitely go and see the movie. And I will be reading more books by Sean Patrick in the future
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Funny and entertaining. John Malkovich and Bruce Willis have very good chemistry. The cast has many other top billing actors. They all gel as a cast.
B004K583KA|5.0|There are a few good Bach cantatas, in my opinion, and this is one of the best ones.<br /><br />The box set is simple and \\"budget\\" but very well organised. It has 60 cds with the sacred cantatas on red discs and 11 cds with<br />secular cantatas on  blue  discs. They have  a big number making it very easy to find out what you are looking for. They don't call cd one, two etc but volume one, two...<br />volume 69 is formed by cd 1 and 2 so you have 69 volumes but 70 css.<br /><br />The 72th disc is a cdrom with texts for all songs , a biography and  a complete track list. Texts for songs are in German, English, French and Spanish.<br />I have mac but the cd rom is for windows. Fortunately,  it is not a problem because Hänssler also thought about that. All you need to do is to open the cdrom and look for a pdf for macs. You can copy it to your mac<br />and you will have all texts, biography and track list. I don't know if the cd rom has content that is  accessible only for PCs but it doesn't really matter because all the important stuff<br />is available in the pdf for macs.<br /><br />There are also two booklets, one with an introduction to the set and one with a complete track list, which is reproduced in the cd rom , showing<br />how more considerate  Hännsler  is than bigger companies such as Deutsche Grammophone.<br /><br />The technical quality of sound and playing seemed very good to me. The performers are German so the singing is more natural and they don't force<br />guttural sounds like Gardiner's  British performers do.<br /><br />Unfortunately I made the mistake of ordering from a seller different from Amazon UK itself and my box set arrived looking like it had a previous owner<br />so I returned it.  I also ordered Harnoncourt and am now in doubt between those two sets and Suzuki's. Music is not my main \\"thing\\", let's say, so I<br />don't think I will have more than one cantata as some reviewers have. My doubt there is just aesthetical because Suzuki isout of the equation for me as<br />It is ridiculously expensive now because is out of print.  But I am glad that I narrowed cantatas collections down to only three after a personal and thorough research.<br /><br />Cantatas that I tried but didn't interest me were Koopman,  the one from Brilliant Classics and Gardiner. Gardiner's cantatas sound like  a Broadway show rather than<br />music \\"written to exalt the glory of God and to encourage Lutheran worship\\".<br /><br />I am not religious but I see as a cultural dumbing down the conversion of sacred songs to secular ones played liked flashing colourful lights.<br /><br />I am still searching for other cantatas but it is likely that I will end up choosing Harnoncourt. The technical quality is inferior to other cantatas, especially Gardiner and Suzuki,<br />but the singing is more convincing, it has more soul. Besides, it uses only male voices, in the way Bach imagined the cantatas. Women's voices are more beautiful and more \\"complete\\" than boy's voices<br /> but there is a much stronger contrast between women's and male's voices than male's and boys' voices. Bach, the utmost musician ( although sometimes I think it was Beethoven ), wasn't in the business of<br />\\"one size fits all\\" so if he wrote the cantatas for males and boys' voices this is the way I prefer to listen to them.<br /><br />But Harnoncourt box set is too bare and, unlike this one, doesn't have secular cantatas or even texts for the songs. The technical quality of sound and the playing of instruments is  not as  good as in this box set but, to my ears, Harnoncourt offers the<br />best, more convincing Bach experience.  Harnoncourt lacks in technical quality but, I think, it has more soul and emotion than any other cantata that I listened to.<br /><br />If you don't care about who is singing (women or boys) and want a better technical quality than Harnoncourt  then<br />this Rilling box set is the best option. Unless you can afford to spend  £700 on Suzuki's cantatas.<br /><br />P.S. I changed my mind and will order this box set again, even if I end up with two collections of cantatas.  I will do that because Hänssler showed a concern for its customers that I don't see<br />in giant recording labels such as Universal and Warner or, for that matter, smaller companies such as Harmonia Mundi.  Thank you, Hänssler!
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Perhaps what the movie does best is maintain a great tone. It feels like a roller coaster ride that can go out of control at any moment (and often does). The tone is incredibly well-set as being one that isn't as jokey as the original but not overly serious either. Seeing this in theaters three times, I loved watching how the movie played with the audience. Sure, the movie is relentless, but we were all in this together. It's essentially a sound-and-lights show (with Oscar-worthy makeup) in that like the original, it doesn't rely on the acting but on events. Typically, this is something I would condemn but that \\"Evil Dead\\" does it so well and completely unapologetically, I couldn't help but lose myself in the material.<br /><br />Be forewarned- this might be the most gruesome and goriest movie I can think of in recent memory. Perhaps the only movie to match its extreme gore is the original. However, what Alvarez and the cast do by remaking this is to keep things as an interpretation rather than a shot-for-shot remake (Van Sant did that in \\"Psycho,\\" and the result was horrible to say the least). The plot is stronger and more solid than the original because, let's face it, the original didn't really have much of a plot. Like the original, the characters are based more on their actions and are secondary to the excellent tech. The only actor required to do much acting is Jane Levy who gives quite an amazing physical performance as a drug addict who becomes possessed. The rest of the cast rounds out what is typical in this genre and do a good job of leaving you with questions as to who will live and who will die.<br /><br />However, as I stated before this is mostly a sound-and-lights show and not a tour de force in great horror acting. You spend more time watching scenes, wondering how they pulled off certain effects (as the director decided to rely heavily on practical effects and only had around 5 shots that had CGI), and crafting a movie that you want to look away from but simply can't. During showtimes, several audience members ran out screaming, others ran out to vomit, others almost passed out, but surprisingly the fewest left due to objections in the subject material. Actually, two women sitting next to my friend left early on because they were admittedly already horrified and couldn't see the movie through. This definitely redefined what many dates would consider when they say \\"Don't worry, honey, I'll go see _______ with you. I don't need to see something else and meet you afterward. I can take violence!\\" I'm sure this movie gave many individuals a very fine line as I often heard couples arguing during the movie (\\"Stop doing that! Not funny!\\"), but there was an overall sense of fun in the audience (although I admittedly saw this in a very heavy college-aged crowd instead of a mix of students with older folks).<br /><br />The special features hint at a possible Director's cut in the future (especially the commentary) and are overall worth watching. Filming this movie was difficult on every actor but also was a rewarding experience for them. Some special features show the application of makeup, how certain scenes were filmed (including the blood rain in the third act- seriously, what horror movie have you watched that is bold enough to let it literally rain blood?), and why the remake was made and produced by Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi. You see that the process of making the movie was a very rewarding one as the actors were allowed to question things in the script, have their own input, and ultimately make the film into a group project instead of something too rushed by the studios. They took their time, changed things from the script, and allowed the film to be a collaboration rather than one person's vision that others were expected to follow blindly. The score is also brilliant and uses a siren during several parts (as well as some nice, syncopated 5/4 rhythms).<br /><br />Ultimately, if you are a fan of the original film(s) and can take lots of blood with your coffee, you won't be disappointed. Seeing this with a large crowd of like-minded individuals was the ideal setting, and Blu-ray/DVD simply isn't be the same. That doesn't change the excellence of the final product in my eyes as I continue to watch it with a sense of awe. Is this the best film of the year? For extreme horror fans, maybe, but in the end we have a remake that manages to be completely unique and yet awesomely familiar, never forgetting its roots. None should have missed the original theatrical run, but the special features alone are worth the price. That plus the movie itself.
0345529057|5.0|Love it.. The best price around for the box set and the seller was kind enough to shipo it out for Fathers Day so I could have it for my Dad.....So nice :)
B000J1AGQI|5.0|The most realistic look at what combat was really like.  A good story as well.  Great tribute to those who fought and those who did not come home alive.
0385360169|1.0|My boyfriend and I were going on a road trip and thought it would be funny to get this book on CD for entertainment.  We were expecting to have some fun making fun of it, but after suffering through four or five disks, we just had to stop.  This is the most redundant book I've ever read.  Really, can this woman not think of better adverbs than &#34;hot&#34;?  There's also a lot of crud about medula ablongatas and inner goddesses that's just rediculous.<br /><br />Also, the woman who reads this book does the most rediculous &#34;man-voice&#34; ever when reading the male characters' lines.  I'll give her a pass on the rest of it because what she had to read was garbage, but ugh, just all-around a miserable read.
B0045INOCO|3.0|Its hard to take this film seriously the second time around.  The overall plot was OK but the sub-plots were just way out there.
1451662432|5.0|No, but seriously. This book is great. I'm a fan of Arnold, been since I was 5 years old. Doesn't mean I'm a fanboy though. This book however is very motivational and gives the reader a great perspective and lessons on life. GET IT NAU!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is almost like the real one. This game is awesome it is the best version of unnecessary on a tablet.
B000099T2L|4.0|Lot's of hit's on here like,Naughty Girl{R-I-P Donna Summers},Baby Boy!!!,Hip Hop Star is great but &#34;Checc on it&#34; is greater,Be With You,Me Myself & I!!!,Yes,Signs, & Speechless.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game was awesome. I have never played a better game. This game deserves 5 stars, any lower is not true.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Dangerously In Love was the only album from her that was great{but not perfect},I Am...Sasha Fierce only has 3 bangers,if I was a boy,Halo, & Sweet Dreams.So I will have to say that 4 is better then the rest.Dangerously has stronger bangers like \\"Baby Boy\\" & \\"Me Myself & I\\"...but all in all this whole album is banging{Run the World \\"Kaskade Club Mix\\"!!! included}.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Just creepy. Couldn't stop reading it though. Fascinating insight into young minds and social interactions. I totally loved reading it.
B008XGW1CI|2.0|After reading the entire Harry Potter series, I was in love. I loved her writing style and her imagination. I was excited to receive this book from a friend. I opened it and started on my journey in Pagford. Much to my surprise, this was not what I bargained for.<br /><br />I gave this book two stars for the following reasons:<br /><br />The plot is intense and all the characters are intertwined, which was super confusing and hard to follow, but impressively written. However, with that being said...the content was atrocious. It had way to much sexual content for the teenage characters, a few of the child characters were sexually abused. I can't stomach this. I am disappointed and thought the plot could have been carried out, without the explicit sexual content.<br /><br />Highly disappointing and disgusting.
B004XANKVO|4.0|Good design, like the hard case to hold my glasses/phone a lot.  Laptop compartment a good size.  Relatively streamlined, not too many trailing webbing pulls and geegaws like my other backpack.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Love this game - have had the PC version for quite a while and have played all the way through a couple times. The graphics are great and the music and sounds are charming, but unless your eyes are a whole lot better than mine, the text is extremely hard to read on a phone. Same with the controls; while most of the game is relatively easy to manage even on a phone, there are a few places where you REALLY need to be on a tablet (or have a stylus handy).  You do get a limited number of skips if you get fed up.<br /><br />I really like the variety of puzzles here, and I was pleased by the lack of in-app purchases.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I haven't seen a good thriller in a very long time but I was glad I decided to see The Conjuring.<br /><br />This movie sets a new standard in my book.  It builds in suspense from beginning to end and does not disappoint or falter.  Character portrayal was executed well by all and I just can't say enough about this movie.  I would gladly watch it a second time in the theater but I will definitely be getting the blu when it is available.  If you have not seen it you're missing out.
B005KELW26|4.0|This case was perfect except if I try to stand it up it just falls down. Other than that I think it is wonderful.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Die hard in Russia?  Rarely in typical Die Hard movies do police show up but I'd assume that in Russia they might show up just once with all the gunfire, explosions and destruction involved.  Not your typical Die Hard movie, this one was pretty far fetched.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|thjsnis really a grey app I got it for my daughter who loves horses and now she wont put it down. lol. I have found myself playing as well
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Loved it as a kid, and now enjoy watching it with my kids!  No &#34;deep story&#34; involved, just a nice, fun movie.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Great book, great ending. Tough to keep building the intensity and excitement for 1000 pages. Good job though. All endings were wrapped up without too much force.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Such an interesting series and so much fun to watch!  I enjoyed every episode and can't wait for Season 4!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Enjoyable and interesting.  Great characters and great situations.  She made some wonderful and astute points about the fallacies in our prison system.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|I like that I can sync it, but am getting very tired of it crashing all the time. Please fix and I will give higher rating.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book....not because of the love story, but because of the life story. Every human struggles one way or another, and this shows that there really is someone out there for everyone. I highly recommend this book to everyone!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Is a inovation for the games of despicable me.<br />I love this game.<br />:)<br />;)<br />This game os aceptable for the kids and young guys.

B009WUAK2M|5.0|I love Stallone! This movie is full of action from start to finish. Has comedy, suspense & action, loved it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have watched all three seasons and I love it, I can't wait for the 4th season to come out !!!
B0058VW36U|4.0|This game is challenging and addictive.  You start playing and you get so involved that you forget there is a world out there.  It is a lot like angry birds.  If you like angry birds, you will like this game.
B007SGM084|5.0|I found the main female character a bit annoying, but the male main character intriguing. Great book for that one reader
140006922X|5.0|In the end Neo finds out the Jesus was the architecture and Zeus was his long lost brother. Mary turns out to be the oracle.
B00B3EJ292|5.0|This movie will entertain you but then when it is over you will be think back on it for months after you watch it.
B0054SMID0|5.0|This movie is worth watching more than once.  There is plenty of twists and turns to make it interesting the first time, and you watch with more understanding after that.
0061950726|5.0|Orphan Train is a wonderful story based on facts about many many orphaned  children who were taken off streets of New York City put on trains and taken to the midwest to be placed in homes, some of which were good, some horrible.  I would highly recommend reading this and then do some follow-up on the historical events.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Really liked this movie kind of like Rocky on the Ocean.  I would recommend this for good Saturday night popcorn movie.
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|What a waste of time and money. We were hoping it would be as good as the first three, but it was a terrible disappointment. The best part was the prologue with sweet little Frodo.<br />Frodo was so engaging - we shared his awe and wonder at the things he saw and experienced. We suffered through his torments. Bilbo, on the other hand, was so blasé that he seemed bored or disinterested. He was annoying and I felt little compassion for him. I don't know if it was the acting, the directing, or a combination of the two, but I felt totally disengaged from this installment. Frankly, I didn't care if Bilbo lived or died, which wasn't how I felt when I read the book.<br />If the two remaining installments are on a par with this one, I will definitely put it on my \\"NOT to do\\" list.<br />About all I can say for An Unexpected Journey was that it had good music.
B00D3XAA4M|2.0|Just a promotional-lite version, useless. You can find more and in depth on free websites like wikipedia and the like.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|it captures nearly everything you can expect or at least need to be aware of if you're expecting. I haven't had a midget yet, but as a nurse I've seen a lot of these situations come to pass. great movie for anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun to play. I always wanted a horse to take care of! Now I can without the smell and the work
B002VHI8FE|5.0|This book is such an unexpected gem. I first picked it up after searching for some good fantasy books and read a review on this one. I have never read a book with such depth, such well written character progression. The characters in this are not all heroes. You hate some, love others, then hate the ones you love, and love the ones you hate because of certain things they say or do. They all grow and change based on the events they go through. It is a rich and vibrant fantasy world, with a fresh view to magic within the world.<br /><br />There is espionage, war, conspiracies, a bit of romance, violence, characters from all walks of life. This book is filled with savagely dark humor, in places where you just wouldn't think there would be. The plot is well drawn out, but it never drags, the pace is always very good. I daresay this book is on par with The Song of Ice and Fire books. A must read. 5 stars all the way, one of my favorite books.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I can't believe after so many books and so many characters that have been in those books.....this is how she (Charlaine Harris) decided to end the series.<br />Really disappointed in her! What was she thinking? Maybe she just didn't care anymore. Just just wanted to be able to say she was done.<br />Waste of my money and time. At least one of us was loyal to the end!
B00B8YSIMY|2.0|It is difficult to appreciate this book because of the terrible editing job, multiple mechanical errors on every page. It makes the reader wonder about  the author, how he could let a book go out to the public when it is so far from being ready. We can all overlook an error here and there, but this shows complete disregard for correctness and readability.<br />  As far as the content, it is alright--a story of drugs, crime, lawlessness. But it too does not have the grace or fluency of really good writing.The story is OK. I read it and was interested in what would happen next. It is too bad the author did not care enough to insure his writing was clear and correct.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|Once in a wile Cirque du Soliel relesed a dvd for us who can not attended live performance  thanks for doing this.the performance are great  ,story is fairy tallish and camera work is fantastic every episode is a part of they early performance and most of them never relesed on dvd
B002NNA9N0|2.0|Excellent acting, but a real &#34;downer&#34; for a story line.  Depicts the worst aspects of our dog-eat-dog culture.  Left me feeling empty and depressed.
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|At first it was really really really  really really really fun but it gets boring after a few times. That's right
B000P407K4|4.0|As a person who lived &#34;under the threat&#34; of Russian nuclear war , I found the movie ( again) very entertaining. If we just changed the names from Rusians to Muslim terrorist and inked out the Russian ambassador, well the fear mongering that the movie mocks is still around. Very worthwhile to watch it again after all these years and remember the noon airraid practice drills and all the other &#34;commie&#34; fears we were fed.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Just started my free trial. Enjoying it thus far.  Hope the remainder of the game only gets better. Enjoy a challenging game on my kindle
B003JTHWJQ|3.0|After reading the selfish gene, I wanted to read more of richard dawkins. I was a bit disappointed about the writing, it's very caustic and satirical and I sometimes got the impression Dawkins was loosing focus sometimes. However, since I am also an atheist I found some of his thoughts interesting. That religion is getting far too much credit and respectfulness I already knew and Dawkins gives us some justification as to why it's ok to be critical.

0471043729|5.0|I am a graduate student in Chemistry that studies Electrochemistry.  This text is a must!  It describes all the fundamentals of electrochemistry but also goes in-depth on any topic you could imagine in electrochem.  Awesome textbook from Bard.
B00632HWOG|1.0|this last update means I have to use my laptop to read my email! what good is an app for mobile devices if it doesn't allow you to do what you need to do and is a step ( or 2) backwards in technology.
B0036TGT3E|4.0|Fun movie from my youth that I really enjoyed watching again on Blu-ray.  Can't wait to show my children this movie.
140006922X|5.0|I haven't read it. But then neither have many of the reviewers.<br /><br />America's Islamophobia is reaching new heights.<br /><br />The equation that Muslim <> Scholar is absurd.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I use my phone for every timer and alarm that I need. This has been the most used app on my phone and I don't bother with any other timer app anymore.
159463176X|3.0|I tend to be rather ethnocentric in my taste in fiction, which made it all the more suprising how much I liked Hosseini's first novel THE KITE RUNNER.  Hosseini beautifully humanized the political strife of the people of Afghanistan bringing is striking universality.<br /><br />I liked A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS even more, with its focus on the plight of Afghani women. It was also quite simply one of the most  moving novels I have ever read.<br /><br />AND THE MOUNTAINS ECHOED starts beautifully telling the childhood tale of two Afghan children separated  at a young age. The initial chapters are quite compelling.<br /><br />But then Hosseini skips forward in time and the novel frustratingly changes point of view in every chapter.  What unfolds is virtually a series of short stories linked often rather tangentially to the initial story.  Life stories unfold, having little to do with the central narrative.  The chapters almost feel like filler that simply delays the concluding reunion.<br /><br />The novel loses all momentum for more than half its length and, beautifully written though it is, can be a rather frustrating read.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|I love mutant roadkill.it is a very fun game.I play it till my tablet goes dead.<br />And even when it is on charge
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Young or old, this game ROCKS! Good hand / eye coordination builder, memory sensory builder, getting bananas for points...AWSOME! Trilogy?
B00377V6IS|5.0|I bought this CD as recommendation from an old friend... and it's just amazing!<br /><br />I would put the tag on this album as ultimate progressive death metal... Opeth music is very complex, this type of music has to be appreciated and keep your ears open to hear every key note...<br /><br />For 13 usd? Definitely is a bargain... in other places you will find this cd for almost 40 usd... If you like death metal and progressive just buy it!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Awesome music.  Especially the last track.  I can listen to this album straight through without skipping any tracks.  I definitely recommend this album.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is one of those books that when it ends you start missing the characters.  Great story that crosses over generations with a suprise ending.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This was some good entertainment. Good action and some underlying comedy make this movie a fun watch.  There were some very dynamic characters in this film and it certainly isn't predictable.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Heart breaking for both parents. To think parents know so little about their children.<br />Theirs life torn apart for ever.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|It's ok... the first few days it is awesomely fun and addicting just making random stuff, creating cool stuff (colossus) and you beet the first five  levels of campaign...after the third to fifth day, it's really boring and it'll be like the third wheel... If there was a better app... but sometimes fun to look at all cool things.<br />Overall it's a fun game, gets boring after a little bit, but a fun free-time filler.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|It is a great spring board for the writers of the series. I really felt like there was a lot more that could have been said and much more character development that could have given the book more depth. I was grateful that the author took responsibility for her actions and was not extremely preachie on the problems with our prison system. Also she offered a look into what could be done to make prison a worthwhile type of punishment instead of complaining about it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three of the &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; books.  I hope she will write more.  I will certainly read them.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|It is a great movie and, being in my 80's and residing in a retirement community, the entire story hits home.
B004GYY714|5.0|No brainer to operate.  Reception quality has been great and the wide selection of choices is impressive.  No complaints, just praise.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I am in my 80's and live in a senior retirement community that I love but would not mind moving to India to be in the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love these two characters.  I am looking forward to the next book.  I love the way Sylvia Day makes her characters so real.
0756405890|5.0|Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicles series is a spectacular read.<br />I finished both books in 3 days and loved both their approachability and the ability he possesses to engage his readers.<br /><br />Kvothe shines not because he is some long lost prince, or destiny driven reborn lord/god/king. He's a common person dealing with realistic issues like being an orphan, hunger, poverty, PTSD, etc. His only real super power is being exceptionally clever. Which is not always the same thing as being wise. Many of his own failures are due to things he started by trying to prove he was smarter than those around him.<br /><br />Great recommendation for anyone who loves fantasy
B000NY12LO|5.0|I was very surprised how much I liked this book, not my typical choice (usually go for the cheap romances) but this one caught my eye and I was extremely happy I spent the money! Highly recommend, some part gave me chills!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I had never watch Doctor Who until I watched this season.  It is quite good and I feel I missed out on something in my youth for never watching the original series.  Can't wait to start watching season 2!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|One more review isn't going to convince anyone at this point, but this is an excellent bit of literature that just so happens to be about zombies. It's clever, it's inspired, it's well thought out, and it's often both funny and emotionally affecting.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|this was a fascinating example of the lengths that parents will go to protect their children. I did not necessarily like any of the characters, but could understand the fear and protective nature of the parents and the desire to consider your child innocent no matter what the evidence.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a much-needed scholarly look at Jesus the Man, not just the myth. You can't understand who he was without understanding the culture he was born into. Aslan has been both a Muslim and a Christian, an American and an Iranian. It is frightening how many people call themselves Christians who don't have the slightest understanding of Jesus and his teachings. Not everyone who admires Jesus has to be a follower of his, or believe in his exclusive divinity. I'll be reading this again. And hats off to Aslan for being willing to publish this book, as a Muslim, knowing the backlash from the crazy Muslim-hating/fearing contingents of religiosity in this country.
0547260695|5.0|Great book with classic illustrations taken to a new level.  I have bought my daughter many copies of the little prince and this is by far her favorite based on illustration.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Love how this season is turning out and can't wait to see each new episode.  We are pacing ourselves on how often we watch an episode. Only half way thru season 7 and looking forward to seeing what happens and getting season 8.
0345529057|4.0|After hearing about the TV series I decided to give the books a shot (I haven't seen the show). The first book sucked me in and I finished all four of these extremely long books in just about four weeks. The third and fourth books drag a bit - it feels like Martin's editors were hesitant to cut some of the excess once they had a hit on their hands. But the story remains engrossing, and I'm looking forward to reading the fifth book when it comes out in paperback this fall.
B004LPLU4K|5.0|This is a wonderful story, well put into film. Its enchanting and intoxicating. Big Thumbs up, I am now 34 and still enjoy this movie.
B008OJ291W|5.0|This cd is completely re-sung and remastered by Jeff Lynne but it's so worth it. A must for any ELO fan.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is one of the most engaging books I have read in a while. For someone growing up during the Kennedy assassination it brings good memories and also causes us to once again wonder, what if......
B000OVLINI|5.0|I highly recommend reading Carlos Ruiz Zafon's trilogy beginning with Shadow of the Wind. Just the right amount of suspense in each story. And Barcelona as the backdrop.
B003SJ6W4I|5.0|I watch this with our children or we will put it in with friends over.  So funny seeing these people in these rolls and super clean.

B004S5C91Q|5.0|made me treasure even more my own relationship with my child. This story honours the strength of a mother's love and natural instinct to protect them.
B0064J6OMO|1.0|Awful. It should be next to impossible to be unfunny when you Jason Bateman, Ryan Reynolds, and Leslie Mann in your cast but somehow this movie accomplishes it. I turned it off halfway through because not only did I not care what happened, but it was making me hate Jason Bateman. Don't waste your time or money.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I love the minions, they make the movie what it is.<br /><br />favorite line in the whole movie...<br /><br />&#34;it's so fluffy i'm gonna die!&#34;
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read.  Can't wait for the next installment!  It's an engrossing story of human persistence and curiosity.  The characters are lushly written and the story unfolding is complex and engaging.
B005LAII4E|3.0|\\"I became a Joe to serve in the field. So if we're fighting up hill we take the hill.\\" After being attacked while on an assignment the Joe's are wiped out and the order is terminated by the President. Three Joe's survived and it is up to them to once again take out the Cobra's and clear the name of the Joe's. There isn't too much I can say about this to help you decide if your going to watch this or not. I will say that I was not a fan of the first movie at all. I grew up watching the cartoon and I thought that was OK but I was more of a He-Man fan then G.I. Joe...but that is neither here nor there. To me the first one just had no real excitement and was kind of boring. I will admit that this one was way better then the first one and actually kept me watching all the way to the end. The dialog is almost as bad as Batman & Robin's but in a movie like this all you really care about is what blows up. Which brings me to my final problem with movies like this. They don't show blood or any real violence in order to keep the PG-13 rating. A lot o parents still think it's too violent for their kids and don't let them watch movies like this. On the other hand since it' not violent enough for an R most parents don't watch either. That leaves this movie in a no-man's land. Overall, much better then the first one, but that's about it. I give it a B-.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|Did not like the movie, found it to be predictable and not very funny. Wait for it to show on cable.
B003VANOFY|5.0|for me they are great... its incredible what u get for the price u r paying... i chose this after viewing like 20 different headsets because it was wireless and even cheaper than some other wired headsets... the sound for me its great (however im not such a music fan so wouldnt be that of a refferenc) the mic works great and they are very confortable, i play for hours and dont get tired of wearing them, big speackers where my huge ears fit good and dont get overheated, and it separates me from the sounds of the outside... the battery life its ok not great... must be lasting like 6-8 hrs, but then u can just conect them and keep hearing... sadly its only usb conection so cant listen to a mp3 or something, i hope to find a way to conect it via bluetooth to my phone
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Few books deal with the historic - and non-emotional/faith-bases - aspects of the book. This one does that. Many believers will have trouble with the view that JC was a historical figure, but that's their problem.<br /><br />This book is excellent. No, matter who wrote it.

B005RJ6AIK|5.0|The soundtrack CD for the Decendants movie, transported me back to Hawaii and especially to Kauai. The overall serenity and softness of the music,featuring the legendary Gabby ( who, by the way, inspired the legendary IZ ), along with other artists, wove a spell that not only reflected the touching moments of the film, but also evoked a feeling of old Hawaii as well. Keeping to the part of the film that caused the main character ( George Clooney ) to finally decide not to sell off the precious, beautiful land, The soundtrack brings you to a place in mind, that is pure Hawaii....that is paradise....that should always be preserved.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|i absolutely loved this book, although it was a little bit of a slow start.  Enjoyed the English setting.  Highly recommend!
B0049J3QAY|4.0|I watched thus after monsters u. It's fun for all ages and works with the prequel. I enjoy all of the Pixar films.
B004VN39YG|5.0|I thought this was a powerful story, told well, that didn't gloss over the music industry or the main characters--it is just that, after all--an industry, a business.  It seemed the story of real people caught up in the sort of unreal life of a major star.  While the supporting cast was pleasant enough, I thought Gwyneth Paltrow gave a superb performance, portraying the main character in all her brilliance, fragility and complexity incredibly well.  Somehow, I never expect her to be as good as she is.  As others have pointed out, the music was excellent.  I'm glad I watched it.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Bought the HD download. Hard to believe it was available before DVD's and Blu-ray. My wife and I enjoyed the movie. I was pleased that it wasn't just action but had a plot behind it. I want to be tactful and not give any of the story away.<br /><br />I was happy about the price too. Cheaper than both of us going to the theatre and now I can watch the movie on Amazon instant video! On our PS3, iPhones and iPads.
B000PMG16U|3.0|This prequel trilogy had to come down to $30 for me to pull the trigger. I have done my share of double-dipping on Star Wars. I already owned Episodes II & III on DVD, yet found the Blu Ray tempting and I wanted to see if Episode I got any better.<br /><br />I bought just this prequel trilogy, because I decided not to double-dip the original trilogy. I have the DVD Special Edition with the letterbox \\"original\\" bonus discs. Though low res and hardly perfect, most of the original award-winning editing is intact: Han shoots first, no CGI Jabba, no CGI Wampa, Cloud City doesn't look like a throw away CGI file from Coruscant, etc.<br /><br />I am sure sometime in the future, the pure original \\"theatrical\\" trilogy will be released using the highest res frame scan to Blu Ray. This is because you, me, and about 500 million other people will gladly pay $70 for 3 old movies we have already seen 500 times. There is no way Disney will listen to George and say no to that kind of revenue. It's only a matter of time.<br /><br />Besides, the original trilogy is not the high altar some make it. You are really just buying it for 2 movies. Every one of the prequels is a better movie than Return Of The Jedi. You know this is true. If you have a problem with Jar Jar and Midichlorians, then you should have a bigger problem with a Teddy Bear taking out the Emperor's Most Elite Warriors... no, the Emperor's Most Elite ARMORED Warriors with rocks and sticks.<br /><br />But I digress... this review is about the Blu Ray prequels. Watching all 3 movies back to back has improved the experience somewhat. There are serious historical story problems in Episode I especially when trying to fact check Old Man Kenobi's statements about Anakin in Episode IV. And, there are several other character conflicts between 4-6 and 1-3.<br /><br />In all 3 prequels the character of Yoda has basically been destroyed. Of all the character assassinations Lucas has done, this was the worst. Yoda is an 800-year old Sage. Never to be involved in politics, never to be using the force for offense, never to be a Field General of a clone army, and certainly never to be jumping around like a lizard in a sword fight when \\"the force is his ally, and a powerful ally it is.\\" Certainly his 800-year force skill level must not have been that great if he couldn't sense a much younger and inexperienced Sith Lord in the same room... and later, couldn't even defeat him one on one (when Mace Windu already HAD defeated same Sith Lord one on one).<br /><br />Despite the Blu Ray, I still have to watch the prequels, particularly Episode's I and II with my hand on the remote so I can skip the horrifyingly wooden performances when the movies are trying (and failing) to be dramatic. Scenes with Anakin and his mother, all romance scenes, all \\"friendship\\" scenes between Obi Wan and Anakin... basically any scene trying to capture the human condition fails miserably in the prequels (as they had succeeded so well in the original trilogy). I blame this on both the actors and the director... they know who they are.<br /><br />I've gone through a transformation on Jar Jar when I saw my kid laughing at him, and laughing hard. Maybe he'll grow up to think Jar Jar is absurd and stupid, but he sure is laughing now, what can I say? The \\"these movies are for kids\\" paradox is the same as the story/character paradox. Do kids understand taxation, governmental bureaucracy, political maneuvering, and the trappings of a military industrial complex? No idea... Jar Jar does make my kid laugh.<br /><br />The main reason these Blu Rays are worth $10 apiece though is the HD sound and especially the music. Lucas once said the only thing about A New Hope that did not disappoint him was the score of John Williams. In spite of the story controversy, John Williams has rather silently continued his masterful composition of motives for Star Wars themes. It's all about hearing the London Symphony Orchestra at its full HD glory (and not that horrid DVD data compressed soundtrack).<br /><br />Williams already has experience being a magician (or repairman) with some of George's more absurd ideas. Making the Ewoks somewhat watchable just because of the quirky music and orchestration. Likewise, Williams' Sith themes and love themes do wonders to help the poor execution in screenplay, direction, and acting. Maybe that's why Lucas calls it space opera. Like in some opera, the music is incredible while the story and drama is often laughable despite the lofty themes.<br /><br />OK, but who writes space opera for children? Another paradox?<br /><br />These movies are worth having and exploded the Star Wars universe and history. The execution is poor and you end up seeing all 3 movies as a lost opportunity, yet you will still watch them waiting for the next Episodes.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|The other 2 and three star reviews are correct. The hero is unbelievable, unlikeable, and inconsistent. His adventures don't seem to advance the main conflict:  finding out why his parents died and taking revenge. It's well written enough to keep me reading, but I don't see where this is all going. I have a slim hope that book 3 is going to tie all of this together and all will become clear but somehow I doubt it. I'm afraid that with each adventure my response was &#34;this is stupid&#34; or &#34;is this really necessary?&#34;, but then again I did keep reading.
140006922X|5.0|I haven't read this book.  But I am so appalled by all of the ridiculous 1 star reviews of this book by Christians that just can't accept that a Muslim with a Ph.D. might actually know more about Jesus than they do that I had to do something to counteract all of that ignorance.  I don't have the kind of time necessary to down vote all of those reviews, so here I am.<br /><br />Here is what I do know:  I'm embarrassed to live in a society that assumes that a Muslim can't also be a scholar of religions, and might possibly be able to write an account that is no less biased than scholarly works produced by Christians.  The fact that so many people won't give this book and author a chance because of his religion is actually quite frightening.<br /><br />For the record, I am a Christian.  I know far less about Christianity than Aslan.  I'm not even interested enough in the life of Jesus to read this book. Despite that, I'm confident that my review is more informed than most of the 1 star reviews that I read.  HTH!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book! Keeps you reading till the end! And makes you want to continue the series. will be reading the rest for sure.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I love Michael Jackson and his music and always will.  Any time he performs, you are going to get an awesome show on DVD.  Must have for part of his collection.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I kept reading so I could find out how he was going to get out of this situation.  I have liked his books that I have read so far.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|If you have seen the movie Eat, Pray, Love, or read the book, this is a wonderful follow up to their love story.  The trials and tribulations they must go through and the hoops they must leap are unbelievable. She writes their story well.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Well it was recommended for my 9 year old but the content I feel is way too heavy for a 9 year old.  I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I was riveted. As I read this I was able to think back and understand how policy outcomes were formulated.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Great show. Has many plot lines happening at once. For a drama it has lots of subtle humor. Highly recommend.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was an awesome dystopian story. I could not put it down. I bought the first story for 99 cents, after I finished it I bought all the rest of the books in this series. The price is ridiculously low. I highly recommend this series it was well worth the money.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I was frankly disappointed. I found it very fragmented, and in attempt to weave a broad canvas of characters, the author didn't succeed in making the reader care very much about any of them.
0061808121|5.0|I have used this cd for my students who were reading Mockingbird. I found it very helpful (for those who would actually listen) and Sissy Spacek's reading was great. It set the tone for the Southern based novel.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I bought Pandemonium on my Kindle within 60 second of finishing Delirium.  I loved all 3, but might have enjoyed Pandemonium the most.
0670022411|5.0|I am only half way through and I am held spell-bound by Harkness' writing style.  Her crisp writing and vivid details makes this a real page turner.<br /><br />I am not overly a fan of the paranormal, I found this novel exceptionally fascinating (historical details) laced with complex and vulnerable characters.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This book was a great way to wrap up the trilogy.  I was skeptical at first about transitioning from Lena to Hana, but ended up thinking it was perfect.
0452284392|5.0|This is one of those books that anyone interested in how (social, biological, economic, etc) systems work should read. It's a very easy read, although personally I'm not such a fan of the magazine-article-style &#34;illustrate-every-point-with-a-personal-anecdote&#34; approach. Nevertheless, I loved it despite that.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is an entertaining and it functions well.  the graphics are good and you can choose a winning deal if your self esteem is down.  but there is only one type of solitaire available.
1250039037|5.0|great continuation of the saga. looking forward to the continuation.I believe that Archer is already writing the next chapter of the trilogy.
B005WBBYXO|4.0|Finally finished reading Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials.\\"  I don't know why, but I kept putting it down and coming back to it.  Though it was slow in some places, I really felt like I had read something special. I can see why it got so many awards. I'm really not sure if I think kids should read it though, it has some really heavy anti-Christian themes that could upset and confuse kids, not to mention adults. If you like fantasy and pondering the meaning of life, this is a great series.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I felt the lead actress did a great job, very heartfelt in several places. Didn't like the actress that appeared at the end. Nuff said about that so I don't write a spoiler.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a Fun game! I play this when I'm bored. I think everyone should play this game if they like horses and can't own a real one. It's just cool to take care of your horse and feed it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love, Love, Love Adel.  Great voice.  Wonderful music.  Great to sing along with.  I think it is very stupid that I have to write a certain amount of words to do a review.  I WILL NOT BE DOING ANYMORE REVIEWS BECAUSE OF THAT!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Motorola razr max. Great game but has occasional lags. A lot like temple run but with better game play. Yipee
B000NQRE9Q|3.0|I have seen the Indiana Jones series in just about every format made.<br />  I give an overall rating of 4 stars for PQ and 4.5 stars for AQ.<br />  PQ- I believe that as much has been done (that can be done) considering many shots<br />  on Raiders were just plain \\"out-of-focus\\". The PQ gets progressively better with the newer<br />  films.<br /><br />  AQ- It seems that an extra effort has been made to \\"Juice-up\\" the soundtrack..sometimes to the point of overpowering the dialog.<br />  I recommend defeating the Main R&L so the center channel can shine. To me, Multi-Channel Stereo sounds better than the lossless HiDef sound codec.<br />  I not surprised...there's not much you can do when movie audio was in it's infancy back then.<br /><br />  PACKAGING- The packaging was poorly designed. Even if you \\"squeeze\\" the cardboard to try to get it out the sleeve,<br />  you still have to grab the vulnerable part of the disc-guaranteeing at least thick smudges and<br />  even nail scratches since it requires so much force to get the disc out.<br />  ** I recommend putting the collection in a separate keepcase or old DVD cases<br />  (I already had the complete adventures on DVD, so I just put the Blu-Rays in the DVD cases.
B000B589JI|5.0|Nice to always have a lighter fluid refill handy for my Zippo! Better than carrying around a can of lighter fluid to make sure I can refill my Zippo when it runs out.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci writes a great spy novel and I've loved everyone. Keeps me hanging on the edge for more. Will is the new James...
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Overall, this is a very good product...even has 3 different equalization settings. Nice that it's rechargeable, too. A tad expensive, but would recommend for the quality, features and small size.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I would give it 5 stars but the only downfall is the need for token to play, but I guess that keeps me from wasting my whole day..
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|its really fun I like how they brought back the dinasours I like how they can rescue dinasours and animals and I could put shops down
B000E9910W|5.0|How could you not like this album if you are a fan of the Doobies.  This will take you back for a great ride.
B00634GHJA|5.0|You can transfer pictures from or to any device WiFi or Bluetooth capable. It works great in my Samsung galaxy phone
B00CF34B2I|1.0|This app is ENORMOUS for a mobile app(over a GB).  On top of that fact, it will only install on certain devices, and mine is not one of them.  I didn't see anywhere that had a compatibility list...I had to read the comments to discover this after a few failed installs.<br /><br />The game looks like fun, but I suppose I'll never know.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I am loving that i can watch at odd free times in MY stuffed life and rerun too catch up on
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used my weather app all the time before the &quot;upgrade&quot;.  The new format is hard to read and navigate through.  I have unistalled the app because it continues to lock up my Kindle.  Please bring back old version or something better than this.
B008MM9630|5.0|So far I am addicted.I have not put this game down since I started it.I will have to soon my kindle needs to be charged.worth downloading.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The  scientific information along with his experience in heaven, shot many holes into scientific  ideas . So much information ,its a positive reread
140006922X|5.0|Loved it! I would gladly recommend this book to anyone I know. I could not put it down. Additionally, I loved your interview on FOX. You have the patience of a saint.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I just love action films & this one, is full of action & laughs. Really enjoyed it. Malkovich (sp) is great!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Must own.  The special online 3D sound files are worth the money.  Getting the CD allows you to rip the songs into lossless format for your iPods.  The lossless format sound quality is significantly better than 256kbps.
B000002KIK|5.0|I will admit, i am a diehard Black Sabbath fan. When i was growing my dad always cranked their LP's. I now have 6 of the original 8 on vinyl (No Vol. 4,) and this release on tape. Yet, after reading the constant negative reviews, i never spent the time to listen to this album. Technical Ecstasy definitely took a heavy turn for the synth's but frankly Never Say Die rocks (at times) as much as anything else in their repertoire. I am hitting myself for never picking this up. The Duo of Johnny Blade and Junior's Eyes will hit you in the face with some fantastic Iommi WAH soloing. Although, at times, Ozzy's vocals are a little flat, they are nowhere as bad as they've been made out to be. In fact Ozzy's vocals in the later years are pretty solid. To make a long story short, this is another record that many people have been missing out on because of a few lowly critics remarks. This album rocks hard, in the original Sabbath fashion. Any true Black Sabbath fan will be pleased. Just as i missed out on Bob Dylan's Self-Portrait album, i missed out on BS's Never Say Die. Sure neither of those albums are the best by those artists but those artists are of the highest caliber. Cheers!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This book is an excellent scholarly examination of Jesus the Man and his times.  I'm not sure what's so controversial about it. For one, this isn't entirely new ground in the study of Jesus. This book is a really fascinating read: measured in tone, well-written and engaging and extremely well-researched (great period details about the world the man we call Jesus lived in).  It is a celebration of a historically important figure -- one whom Prof. Aslan clearly admires -- an intelligent man who sacrificed his life for his beliefs. Frankly,  I'm having trouble understanding why the historical portrait of Jesus portrayed in this book is at all controversial. The picture that emerges is of a man who had deeply held beliefs about fairness and charity, who saw the Romans as oppressing the poor and disenfranchised and dedicated his life to fighting for change. Helping those less fortunate, giving counsel and direction to the sick and the poor, and fighting against those that would use power and money to oppress others. Sounds pretty Christian to me.<br /><br />Side note one: If you believe the bible should be interpreted strictly as written, you should probably avoid this book.  As have many noted scholars before him, Prof. Aslan notes the bible was not written to be taken literally, but includes parables, contradictory philosophies and recollections pieced together, often many decades after Jesus' death by authors who did not know him personally.<br /><br />Side note two: The criticism of the author for being a \\"devout Muslim\\" and therefore unable to write about Jesus objectively, is among the most ridiculously stupid criticisms about a book ever. If this were a valid criticism, then any book on the Muslim religion by a devout Christian should be equally dismissed, which of course is silly.  Should Jews than not be able to write Christmas songs? (We'd have to throw out White Christmas then.)<br /><br />Frankly, if this book offends you, you probably should re-examine yourown views and ask yourself why your response to an excellent and well-researched book on an important historical subject by an educated and experienced scholar, is to be racist. A better approach might be to try reading the book.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|awsome game but very disappointed that i lost all of my stuff after the update :/ still overall great game!!!!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the whole series a must read. This book is so challenging especially hard , it's sad and yet you can't put it down. I loved it!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app used to be pretty decent. Now it has been redesigned to resemble a Facebook game and hourly forecast has been removed. Avoid.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|We enjoyed the movie, wanted to see it before RED 2 came out. Loved Helen Mirren, she's good in anything. Bruce Willis plays his normal tough guy - good light entertainment.

B009NY43NY|2.0|A blah ending to an amazing series. Although the end of was somewhat predictable, I still enjoyed the story getting there very much. I just wish this book was as well written as her earlier ones.

B006KX3GXO|3.0|Its an OK app overall. i dislike that it was difficult for me to use. at least it was for me. out of the random, it sucks because i cannot use the camera feature because my kindle fire (not the HD) does not have a camera on the device period. hopefully it will be easier for people who agree its confusing.
0525425772|4.0|I buy these books for my teenage grandchildren but always read them myself before passing them along. This one was good but not up to the caliber of the others, in my opinion. There is no real &#34;mystery&#34; to solve here just the suspense of whether Theo will be able to help his friend save the family farm.
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|There are no words to fully explain why this movie makes your brain cells explode with excitement and joy and sorrow and happy and everything in between.  To say Barbra is magnificent is like saying the sun is just a ball of gas in the sky.<br />Barbra sings &#34;I'm The Greatest Star&#34;  and believe me, truer words were never spoken than that!
0375423877|4.0|This book was very highly recommended to me by a friend and though I thought it was sweet and lovely in it's way, the writing seems almost childlike to me. I would prefer a little more complexity in the sentence structure but it served as relaxing bedtime reading.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|It was a great show.  I really liked the action and all the love scenes.  It doesn't get any better than this
1401938906|5.0|Pam Grout's perspective and humorous take on law of attraction and quantum physics kept me reading.  Even before I got to the experiments I felt I had a knew internal vision to help me manifest.  I am now seeing heart clouds every day...so is my husband because I am pointing them out to him....Also I asked for the school of minnows who hang out in front of my  house to show me hearts and it was witnessed by a friend.  I have purchased 7 of these books and told many more than that about it.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|The reviews with only 1 star are due to not knowing how to navigate the app. However, when you first open this app it will show you how to navigate it. These people must have skipped it. This is a wonderful app.
140006922X|5.0|I'm neither Muslim nor Christian nor a member of any other religion. But I am interested in the history and sociology of religion: the role it has played in politics, social movements, and the creative life. Reza Aslan is an admirable and knowledgeable scholar; Zealot is a thoughful, thorough, and well-written addition to a field of study--the attempt to place the historical Jesus, whether or not such an individual actually existed, in the context of his time and place--that dates back to Ernest Renan's 1863 Life of Jesus. If such an enterprise interests you, do not be swayed by the rhetoric of talk shows and the controversy they engender. You will find Zealot worth reading, and I can almost guarantee that you will learn at least a few things that will surprise and fascinate you.
B007SGM084|4.0|Pretty good series, by the third book things were starting to feel &#34;old&#34; with the same characters over and over.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Good movie and I'm glad I got the DVD to be able to see it whenever I wish. Very quick delivery. Very well pleased.
B0060D2SU6|5.0|This movie is incredibly hilarious! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a few laughs! It's more of a teen/young adult type comedy but still very very funny.
6305718954|4.0|It took 2 trys before I got a DVD that worked for me but finally I did so all is well. The movie is a strange one but I like it none the less. In strange ways it makes you think. I'm glad they reworked the ending for the American audience because I would not have liked the european version nor probably have bought the DVD.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|This is a very addictive series.  The Blu-ray set have a lot of other information about the series included too.

B0049P1N3K|3.0|Good read.<br />  Takes positive thinking to a new level.  Great follow to The Secret. Will continue to read Rhonda Byrne.
140006922X|5.0|While on vacation this past week I READ THE BOOK.  It is very interesting.  Do you like thinking about history in new ways?  Would you like to read a well-sourced academic treatment on the historical Jesus?  Yes?  Then read this book.<br /><br />Do you 'know all you need to know'?  Is your mind made up?  Would you like to have your pre-existing opinion supported in all things at all times?  Then Do NOT Read this book.<br /><br />Also, while you are NOT Reading this book -  be quiet please, because some of us are trying to read and learn new things and you -the opinionated nonreader- have nothing to offer about Reza Aslan's scholarly and interesting book.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Karen Armstrong, probably the most respected and well known theological scholar (and btw was a nun), lays out the same facts and draws similar conclusions in her books. However this does not make Mr Aslan's book any the less interesting and in fact being written in a less scholarly way than Ms Armstrong's it may be more accessible for many.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The sensation of reading this book is like filling your mouth full of Whatchamacallits, Airheads, Mike & Ike's, and Big League chew. It's pure literary candy, well-written, sugar-high inducing, and mind meltingly fun. It's like a bumpy covered novel for folks who have any nerdish tendencies and an appreciation for the unremembered 80s. Well played, Mr. Cline.
B001RCD2DW|4.0|I use these headphones to monitor, mix and master tracks when I'm not able to use my near field monitors.  They are very comfortable to wear for extended periods, are solidly constructed and the detachable cord can be a life saver.  For me, their best attribute is the open and accurate reproduction of instrument placement in the sound stage.  I can close my eyes, focus in on the music and hear where every instrument (or sound) is positioned both Left to Right and Front to Back in the Sound Stage.  I can tell if multiband processing was used to compartmentalize instrument positioning in the Sound Stage.  These cans seem to have a pretty flat frequency response curve over most of the audible range.  But they slightly attenuate the bass frequencies so you will find your mix will turn out too bass heavy if you don't remember to compensate for this one (easily rectified) characteristic.  That is the only reason I gave them four instead of five stars.  These are definitely &#34;audiophile&#34;, &#34;reference&#34; or &#34;professional&#34; headphones, so if you are looking for headphones that transform your music into a bass-thumping-cymbal-crashing masterpiece of listening pleasure, then THESE ARE NOT FOR YOU!  With these headphones you will hear what the music REALLY sounds like from the source with minimal enhancement or coloration.
1781162646|4.0|I picked this up on a whim; was looking for some light reading. I was not disappointed at all. It is a short book, but Stephen King has taken the time to develop the main characters and  the story line quite well. This is a coming of age story, a ghost story with super-natural elements, a mystery, and a nostalgic glimpse into the smaller amusement parks that pretty much don't exist in America any more. It has some chilling moments, but won't call it extreme horror. I really enjoyed it -- worth the read.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I learned so much about Steve Jobs and the whole Apple world.  I was amazed at how engrossing this biography was.  I highly recommend it.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|A great album from a great band.  They always create complete albums and Trouble Will Find Me is no different.  A must have in my book.
1401308201|5.0|Not really expecting a book of spells, I was nonetheless spellbound by what I found inside the covers and between the pages.  A must have for anyone even half in love with &#34;Wicked&#34;.
1400031001|5.0|Scarborough, Maine. July 29, 2013. Hancockpt@aol.com<br /><br />I should like very much to someday meet Mr. Boyd, to thank him for writing Any Human Heart. It is an exquisite piece of work which carries off the trick that only real literature can achieve-- it gives us an unexpected glimpse of ourselves, not only as we have imagined ourselves to be, and wanted to be, but as we really are with all our longing and our desire to be understood.<br /><br />One day I will be old and, no doubt, alone in one of those warehouses where they put old people. Everyone there will be a stranger to me, and I to them. There will be a common room there with sun light falling in during the long afternoons. I will invite everyone to sit with  me in this room while I read this book aloud to them.  As soon as I have read the final page, I will start in again. The audience will change of course as one by one we disappear and new arrivals are checked in.  I will make arrangements for someone to take over for me when the time comes. This is the only book I will bring with me for this last part of the journey. The only book any of us will need to prepare to leave behind all that we have learned and failed to learn of love.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|MY HUSBAND & I BOTH LOVE THIS MOVIE & WISH THEIR WERE MORE JUST LIKE IT! MY HUSBAND GETS MAD @ ME BECAUSE I THINK THE ACTOR IS REALLY REALLY!!!!!!!!! HOT!!!!!!!! NO KIDDING
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Such a good price for a cute little movie. Our son has watched it so many times we all know many parts by heart.
B0031TZBGU|3.0|We learn a lot about an African culture that existed before the advent of the white man. We learn about the impact of the white man's arrival and the horrors of missionary zeal, but we are \\"told\\" not \\"shown\\" and that's a huge distraction from what could have been a great novel.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Friends have been telling me to check this app out. Finally I did&#62;and I love it. Lots of different subjects to check out.
B00127RAJY|1.0|it doesnt work in australia and shouldnt be selling here if that is the case and it was at the top of the list
B00881PTRC|5.0|My Grandson (7) and I enjoy playing this//it is fun to see little guy and it is not so simple as some of the hangman gamers are.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Right now all it really does is play Youtube and Netflix. I already have a Roku which does Netflix just fine. I don't watch Youtube hardly at all. The Chrometab mirroring for PC is OK, but I also don't have much need for that. I tried streaming WatchESPN and Hulu from a Chrome tab and it was too laggy. I understand that feature is beta still so it will likely get better but I don't need that. What I would really like is mobile device mirroring for my Nexus 4 and Nexus 7. It doesn't look like this will be a feature on this device even in the future. So for now, I get everything I need using my Roku, my Raspberry Pi with Raspbmc and a cable that I can plug into my macbook Pro.<br /><br />I also have Amazon Prime, so I don't have much need for the 3 month netflix subscription that I qualified for. I still haven't received the email from that, btw.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this app.  My husband is HOOKED!!! He plays these games every minute he gets.  I play the free tourney every day.  I also love getting the free bingo cards every day.  This game is relaxing and exciting.  I love BINGO!!!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This was poorly written...merely a sexy Mills and Boone.<br />I finished this under sufferance...totally boring...designed for 20+ yr old females compensating for dreadful sex life.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I use this every day to play with my two  sisters.  We all love to play the game and then we write little notes to each other.
B0000DIXLM|5.0|Always have been a fan of the Eagles and this is a great CD to have and add to my collection!
B007V80WUC|5.0|I am a huge fan of Dream Theater and other prog rock/metal bands. When I heard this album, I was blown away. This is a fantastic album. One of my new favorites! In some parts it sounds a bit more conventional/mainstream than some other bands but overall I would highly recommend this is if you like DT or other prog bands.
B002Q7JYPC|4.0|Enjoyed the CD! &#34;Hole in The World&#34; is a great new song by the Eagles and have always enjoyed the mix of their voices!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I really liked this app until they updated it. I do not care for how it is set up. Had to find another weather app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son and I love to take turns playing this game. We work together to earn bananas and experience. It's a fun game that we both like to play.
B007MU85D0|5.0|The whole album is enjoyable and easy to listen to. Not one song makes want to hit the \\"next\\" button.
B008PU8SR4|5.0|I loved everything about this book. To actually laugh out loud and then almost weep the next. Two books in one. I believe written for children. An enjoyable and at the same time a profound thought provoking read for adults about a challenged young boy.
0062238868|4.0|This is what I was looking for, IT works for what we wanted. Why do I need to type for words
1400168171|5.0|Very good audiobook, i love every single chapter. it teach you so many things. I Highly recommended to anyone interest in music.. And life itself!
0525953728|4.0|This is what I was looking for, IT works for what we wanted. Why do I need to type for words
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I enjoyed the villainous blond haired actor...funny, engaging, and good one liners.<br />Bond's repartee's are always good.... especially the 'put it all on red'.... 'circle of life'<br />As everyone ages and younger people inhabit roles that fell to more mature folk in the past...a mental transition must be made to accommodate and accept the change...movies like this are a nice tableau to enable otherwise ossified older people to laugh and accept the change.  In the Bond genre and stories...miss moneypenny is reborn as a  young black lady...cool.  The English Patient lead is now the new &#34;:M&#34; ... and is quite suave ...good selection.  Time for Dame Judy to slip into the dusk of her self described &#34; I never memorise script &#34; ... a tribute to the skill of melding 'ugly' and 'glib' into noteworthy stage presence....as accomplished as she is..  If you've seen enough<br />Bond episodes, you'll appreciate Skyfall as a new beginning....and a promising one at that.  Who will be the next bond??  A 70 y/o hedonist is not particularlly appealing on screne...Playboy Hefner should be banned from public view...a grinning 'oldster' pronging young bimbos is not appealing.  Just as well the Greek scene of bond and the girl in bed...was wordless...spared us some really crappy verbage.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I have been using Google as my search engine for years and never had a problem until now. Maybe it's Kindle Fire that is the problem but whichever it is it doesn't impress me at all. I liken it to windows 8 which is another attempt to update and &#34;modernise&#34; a perfectly good system.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Draws you totally into the story as do the other two that preceded it. Katniss makes an excellent heroine. I enjoyed it very much.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|This lantern was great for our camping trip its very bright, we love the different settings and very durable would recommend it to everone
B003O86FMW|5.0|Totally draws you in. I felt that I HAD to read it because I wanted to know what happened to Katniss and Peeta!
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|I bought this movie when it was on sale for around 6 dollars. I saw this movie when it first came out in theatres and I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys history or good movies for that matter. Cate Blanchett is always fantastic on the screen but portraying one of Englands greatest Queens she is phenomenal. Truly a great movies about a Great Queen!
B007KUFDBY|5.0|My 7 year old enjoyed it too.  I loved what had time to watch. We'll watch it many more times I'm sure.
B003JTHWJQ|1.0|All I can say is, unless you are looking for a scientific point of view for a college course, it is a snooze fest!
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|My Hubby and I watched this after the kids went to sleep.  It was a pretty decent movie. It had action and a story line.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Hard to find games like this to play any where at any time with good connection<br />And very nice players too
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  It surpasses all I have viewed before.  I purchased Les Miserables for a friend's birthday.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I always enjoy the writing of Neil and this one didn't disappoint. An interesting tale from a young boys perspective.
B000HZD168|5.0|Wrath of Khan was the BEST of the Star Trek movies with Shatner and Nimoy!  A true classic from start to finish!
B008Y5N3O8|1.0|One of the worst movies we have ever seen.  We are only thankful that we didn't pay to see this movie in a theater because we would have certainly walked out.  We only continued to watch it because we kept thinking it would get better, but it never did.  Horrible.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Great motion picture.  Hugh Jackman is a very talented man.  The story is timeless and will be one of my all time favorite movies'
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great little device. Very simple to set up and operate. Right now limited apps will hinder it's value but once other apps become compatible the sky is the limit for this device.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so addictive, I just want to keep playing it all the time. Really, really love this game.
B000MLNUBI|5.0|Just bought it a month ago, and I can´t take it off... it´s my favorite. It looks aweseome, although my wrist is thin. Met my expectations.
B0041D843M|5.0|I think everybody should read it and try to follow its principles.<br />We would have a much healthier society and better world.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I have givin the app five stars because I'm totaly hooked. The game is perfect if you just have a couple of spare minutes this a perfect game for you.<br />The one downside I've found is that when you play the game for more than say 15 levels in one go everything starts looking alike and the games starts getting a little boring. That being said I don't believe the game was desinged with playing that many in one go in mind and is once again engaging and fun if you haven't played it for an hour.<br />I would and have advised this game to people of all age's from a 4 year old kid on his parrents phone/tablet to seniors citicens.<br />The app is as addictive as other populare games such as fruit ninja, angry birds and ruzzle.
B003RV43X4|5.0|It is a great movie. Really enjoyable if you like mythological types. Plenty of action to keep you intrigued and on your toes.
B00821OX98|4.0|Characters, effects and story line are fantastic. If you haven't watched this from the beginning I suggest you go back and catch up on the plot.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Really fun so far. Puzzles are a little too easy but that is OK with me! I got the free version, but it's worth two bucks if you like puzzle games.
B00CCEHR80|5.0|Another high quality recording from a great period of Jerry Garcia Band history.  This recording from the Greek Theatre has an added bonus of having Bela Fleck perform on two of the second set songs.  This release is similar in sound to the other 1990 JGB release &#34;Jerry Garcia Band Live&#34; recorded at the Warfield in 1990, but has many different songs and is a little more upbeat.<br />I personally like this Volume Two much better than the sound, performance, and energy of Volume One.  I highly recommend this release to any Garcia fan.  Enjoy
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is seriously one of the best and possibly the best of the series.  If you like the series at all you will love this one!  If you have just found this series I am sorry to say that starting here would NOT be my recommendation - however the first book &#34;Slave to Sensation&#34; is also fantastic and you will not be disappointed by starting there.  Though I don't think you have to read each and every story in the series to enjoy this one, it is definitely one of those series where the plot builds on those books that came before.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I am three books in now and every book is the same.  The writer is incapable of getting repeat sales on merit alone.  Everything must go wrong all the time, like a soap opera.  I tire of the cliffhangers at every book end.  I want a complete story, not just more greek tragedy.  This author is as overrated as Matthias.
B00AX6KNOY|4.0|Robert Rodriguez does it again with this tongue-in-cheek take on &#34;bad&#34; teachers. Elijah Wood, Josh Harnett, Salma Hayek, Famke Janssen, a young Usher, and Robert Patrick are among the familiar faces in this alien-are-out-to-get-us movie. While the creature turned out to be a bit lame, the movie moved along well enough. There was just enough (but not too much) teenage angst thrown in for the benefit of the young people who tend to like these movies. In the end, it's the kids who save the day (of course). And haven't many of us wondered if some of our teachers were aliens?! Not bad.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|When Voyager was first broadcast,I wasn't that excited about it, but having recently watched some of the other Star Trek series, I have to say I've enjoyed it more than any of them.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|An outstanding conclusion to the series.  On the first book where Sanderson took over, I was quite nervous about whether the characters could maintain their personality with the change in writing style, but by this book everything is working perfectly.  For such a massive tale there are surprisingly few loose ends left unresolved.  I was also worried that the scope of the events in this book would make the narrative less character-driven, but Sanderson does an excellent job of getting things where they need to go while staying true to Jordan's vision of each character.  There are a good number of shocking turns and some tragedy, but by the end it feels like everything has happened exactly as it should, and will again.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|As in all of James Rollins books, you will be on the edge of your seat from the first page to the last. Once you start reading you can not put it down.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show. DVD excellent to view. I highly recommend the DVD and the show, be aware though highly adult content.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|I got his second album first and his first album second, lol. Nevertheless both CDs rock! He's Awesome...what more can I say!
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I don't have too much to say in favor of this little movie...I wanted to see Julianne Hough in the performance because I've watched her on Dancing with the Stars and have heard her sing , so I wanted to see her acting ability...don't really have an opinion about the acting ....love her dancing though!
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|An interesting well-written read but this first novel does not tell the reader about the flaws in Inspector Hole's character that are exposed in later books in this series.  Without them, Hole's character is flat and one-dimensional.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I've seen the stage play and found the movie version very moving and quite wonderful too. The individual performances by the actors were stellar in every way. I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end...I would highly recommend  this movie ... I think it's a Must See....so happy I viewed it....I will purchase it for my Movie Library....
B002SRQ214|5.0|Highly recommended this is backwards compatible AMD2+ works beautifully increased performance on win7 everything runs smother and faster rock solid processor. It only took ten minutes to install only had to update bios and restart a couple of times and bingo! Price was brilliant and good service as usual.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I love Maggie Smith and would watch anything she is in...I never tire of her roles ...she has a way of drawing you in ....Love her the movie was ok too
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I've thoroughly enjoyed this series more than I thought would! I loved both of the characters and liked Christians perspective on how Ana affected him very very nice!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|What a great serious actor he is...loved this role for him ...and to be opposite one of the greats like Robert De Niro what can I say...super great story line well acted ....I loved it and would recommend it to everyone...
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|How can the author be a devout Muslim and write about the most important Christian of all.  Where is that listed in the author's bio...the book may be ok, but it is written with a view from one of the most skewed religious beliefs out there...
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As a skeptical Christian who believes in God, but questions the absolute veracity of a contradiction-filled Bible, this is the book I've been wanting for all of my adult life.  This book focuses on the historical Jesus, and the times in which he lived.  It provides context and background for many passages and stories in the Bible.  It also provides information I've been wanting about what in the New Testament is verified by other sources.<br /><br />The book is well written, and although it is written by an academic, it does not read like a textbook.  I have, unfortunately, lost half my day to this book already - I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />As for the controversial subject matter, I feel that this kind of historical information doesn't make me any less of a Christian, it just makes me a more informed one.  Just as understanding how many of our Christian traditions are based in Pagan rituals hasn't made me enjoy them any less-- instead, knowing their history gives them a deeper meaning.  Likewise, this book does not threaten me or my faith, rather, it educates me, gives me information for reflection, and provides substantial food for thought.
B00CMQX84A|4.0|there was this akward part in the song surf crazy when is said its a bikini wonderland but if you arent thinking negatively you wont catch it ;)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|do not want to write a comment this is a waste of my time and I will not do again<br />the five stare are sufficient
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book was very good from start to finish<br />Good insight to how sniper seals were used during the war
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I love the game but the sound is laggy and it glitches out so bad hope u guys will fix it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE this game it's so addictive This game is a must have the little minions are so adorable .AND ITS FREE
B0096CDG0O|3.0|Easy to play with friends and to keep in touch with the Chat bottom .  It's all about change and luck
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Some people say that subway surfers is the same as temple run .But it's not because you don't have to titlt your tablet .But subway surfers is much better than temple run.I love this game and who made subway surfers come to life.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun yet challenging enough to keep you busy. Its great way to pass time while waiting to do something.
0061900656|4.0|I really liked the book. The only issue I had with it is that it didn't cover breastfeeding at all. It only showed the baby being fed by a bottle which isn't what my son will see. But otherwise the illustrations are nice and my 2 yr old son was able to follow the story and get into it.
0688152023|5.0|The pictures are beautiful and the explanations of the exercises and stretches are very easy to understand. I highly recommend this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the characters and plot...this show is addicting! I can't wait for season 4, just bummed i won't be able to watch one episode after another.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have enjoyed the high quality of this drama.  The story lines are enjoyable and realistic, the production value is great.  It's refreshing to have a show that doesn't rely on sex, sarcasm, or brainless plots.  It's great entertainment.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Now some of the people are saying in the comments that after a certain level it gets much harder, well I'm here to say that it's not impossible to beat or at least in easy it is.  Any way the game is the best TD I've ever played, (bloons td 5 makes a close second.) I highly recommend it to everyone'
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Looking forward to the next one. This game is great but needs more to do after vol 30. It's a game I don't want to get bored with
B004XIZN5M|5.0|A lot of eye opening info and points of view that people don't know they don't know. Read this book in a week and been using it as a user manual ever since. FYI part 2 is awesome is a good add on. Worth every penny.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard all the gossip about the fascinating Mr. Grey but really didn't realize that under all of the explicit sex was a very lovely story of  how a young man and a young women fall in love in this crazy world. I think that we all have some sort I baggage and to find someone who loves our crazy is a super special gift! Loved all of the books!!!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Product works great!  I've charged both my HTC phone and my wife's iPhone at the same time and it performed perfectly.
B004BJMEO6|3.0|I purchased this DVD due to the many good reviews on Amazon and the so-so ones over on imdb.  I was disappointed in many ways with this movie.<br /><br />First, the writer/director, Nicole Conn (known for \\"Claire of the Moon\\"), places a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie that it is \\"Inspired by Real Events\\" (or something of that nature).  As a person who watches and analyzes movies, her disclaimer should have read \\"Movie is a Remake of 'Un Amour de Femme' with a Religious Twist\\"!  -- read my review of that movie on Amazon --<br />The story, not to be too redundant in the reviews, is about a married, quasi-religious woman who strays from her seemingly dull marriage (has one, male child) and falls for a lesbian woman.  She has to decide which is better for her: her devoutly religious life and her family OR a life of being a lesbian.  Yes, it is straight out of \\"Un Amour de Femme,\\" complete with a curly and long-haired son (granted, not the 9-year-old, but a 20-some-year-old playing a 16-year-old!) -- look out Peter Frampton!<br /><br />Second, what does Peyton, who is the best part of the movie as far as acting goes (and pretty to boot), do to afford a multi-million dollar home in what seems to be Beverly Hills to live in by herself and sit and swim in a pool ALL DAY LONG (it seems)?  There is no background info on her character (her family, her finances, for two instances), but all the other characters are described 'ad nauseum'.  Yes, I can buy that Elena is stuck in a lackluster role as housewife/mother, having given up her photography career, but the story never discusses Peyton, the second MAJOR character in the movie!  Why, Ms. Conn?  Are you hiding some information about yourself, seeing that there is an autobiographical \\"feel\\" to the movie?<br /><br />Third, the problem with writing a storyline with religion as a major element.  Ms. Conn seems to be attempting to discuss lesbianism while coming to grips with how to do so with the addition of the religious element in the movie.  She never seems to be able to show or balance religion in a positive light unless it is about the \\"progressive\\" Christians (not even going to go there).  She merely inserts monologues with Tyler discussing love like an outdated hippie from the early 70s.  Ms. Conn even inserts the character of Millie (I believe the character's name) to give a Christian stereotype of a coniving and scheming little b-----!  Insulting!  I'm not even religious, but it is insulting.<br /><br />Fourth, the son (and his girlfriend) and the father.  Talk about wooden, two-dimensional characters!  The son finds out his mom is \\"becoming a lesbian\\" and begins a life of theft, drinking, and watching lesbian porn(!).  The father doesn't even go that far!  In fact, the father simply disappears for most of the movie, as if Ms. Conn doesn't even know how to insert his role into the narrative.  He has every right to be angry and hurt by his unfaithful wife, but is shown in a bad light, both figuratively (as preaching in church about infidelity) and cinematographically (dark scenes in rooms that are claustrophobic).  He is rarely put into a positive light.  The son's girlfriend (an actress obviously too old for the part, like the son) just spouts off inane lines in front of the camera, even \\"mugging\\" every chance she can. It's buffoonish.<br /><br />There are many great elements of the film that, unfortunately, are trumped by (at least) the four pre-mentioned problems.  The camerawork and editing are quite good.  Even the few lesbian sex scenes are very well-shot and edited.  Note:  there is little nudity in the movie.  Ms. Conn can film a sex scene quite well.  Too bad the narrative isn't given equal respect.  I like the couples discussing how they met, especially the two that came from the same Oregon town and found each other in the world.  It was the best part of the movie.  However, the entire \\"narrative insert\\" concept has been done many times (\\"When Harry Met Sally\\"??).  The Tyler monologues are just annoying.  I felt like I was watching a really bad (chuckle here) Tom Cruise \\"Magnolia\\" impersonation.  The dual endings were okay.  The character named Wave was my favorite; on the other hand, Nash and Tyler were simply annoying and wooden.<br /><br />2 1/2 Amazon stars.  The story/narratives seem disjointed.  Too many characters that are stereotypes.  Religion is inserted and unrealistically portrayed.  Music (mostly by female performer(s)) was annoying and could have been better (even eliminated in several scenes).  Don't be fooled - the movie is so similar to \\"Un Amour de Femme\\"' that I believed that it was indeed a remake!<br /><br />I am unsure why the overly high ratings on Amazon and the mid-range 6.0 rating on imdb..

B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Was extremely happy with this app by its many aspects including the varying themes, and, INFINITE HEIGHTS! I highly recommend this!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|A great, all-around, simple-controlled game that anyone can enjoy, BUY THIS AND HAVE FUN! YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The fun just keeps getting better in the joyous new Angry Birds theme... Star Wars! Please do not hesitate to purchase this!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game so much because it is just like PC , but please make more updates so we can have more supplies and a Nether Portal instead of a Reactor.
B008M721MS|4.0|I can finally stay in touch with my family straight through my kindle, now to just get logged in to it...
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|Okay, I realize that movies like Evil Dead are subject matter that most don't actually believe in, but for those out there who can suspend disbelief and give the subject matter possibility of credence, you are the people I'm talking to. Remakes are seldom as good or better than the originals, which is true of this movie too. The first one, with Bruce Campbell, is a cult classic and really hokey, but highly loved by his fans. This remake is absolutely serious in every aspect. However, there is no way that you could be one of these people at the cabin, who are injured so very critically, and still function. That's the thing I kept having issue with. If you just want a gory, horror flick. This will fit the bill in every way.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Good book.  Disturbing due to recent events in the media and the fact that this could in fact b based on a real life situation.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|The movie was good and cast was good as well, but it would b wise to read the book first bc it gives more background on situations and characters or some parts could b lacking clarity....  But I do feel that it followed the book pretty well..
B005FMZVLQ|3.0|fairly light, I thought the size would be heavier, but the material correoa clock is not very good, it would be great if you place a silicone, like
0316228583|1.0|I started this book thinking that it would be engaging and a good read.  Instead, it is far from interesting and filled with so many boring characters you can hardly tell them apart, or want to.  Don't waste your time with such a silly story.  Drugs, rape, etc. are used as a spice to try to liven up this poor excuse of a book.  I kept waiting for the story to get better.  It didn't.  Stick to Harry Potter.  Loved that series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because the most awesome thing about this book is the suspense in it, and the author did a very good job with then introduction, main body, and the conclusion. Also because I like it a lot!!!
B00AQ2G7D6|5.0|I've watched this movie a number of times and it is one of Steve McQueen's better ones.  It's much better than the remake.  Faye Dunnaway is very good and the cast of very recognizable actors makes it a good movie to watch again and again.
1781162646|4.0|Stephen King has not lost his ability to write strong stories.  JOYLAND, the name of an old theme park, is a lot of un to read.  It has suspense, thrills, interesting characters, and a tightly developed story. It's more straightforward than one would expect from KIng, and definitely shows that he continues to grow as a writer, even at this stage of his career.
140006922X|5.0|You entirely sold me on buying this book!  Anything that gets you all fired up like this has to be a good read.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|Uno is one of my favorite games to play and this version offers lots of options.  My only complaint is that it is too easy to win - even when you put it in the &#34;hard&#34; mode.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|As always, I just enjoy Grisham's books. This was a bit on the silly side, though. Hope next one has some courtroom drama.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I enjoy playing Spider Solitaire and found this version to be what I expected .  It has good speed and graphics.
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|Difficult to use.  I found the rules difficult to follow.  Graphics were nice but I returned the game after a couple of fruitless tries.
B0013TPCX2|4.0|As you will sweat like a pig when you going all out on your turbo.  Ok product, provides needed coverage for the top tube but could have been a bit wider towards the handlebar/stem.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast does everything I felt was lacking in a Roku player or a smart blu ray player.  It is really easy to use and install the software; it takes less than ten minutes.  When was the last time you installed an electronic device in less than 10 min and had it streaming content to your tv?  The Chromecast gets its power from a USB port on your tv.  The two tvs we have bought in the past 5 years have both had one, so this was super convenient for us.  If you don't have a USB port on your tv, you can plug it into an outlet.  I'm not sure why some people are annoyed by this, it has to have power folks.  Great product at a great price.  If this were an apple branded product I'm sure it would cost at least 3x as much.
0061124265|5.0|I gave this to a group of people to read.  One of the comments was &#34;I wish that I had read this when I was 16!&#34;<br />Another said, &#34;When I left the house, I gave it to my daughter and said please read this!&#34;<br />It seems to have left an amazing impact on everyone whose life it touches.<br />I would highly recommend reading this book.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Sometimes reality makes better drama. This series offers a very cynical view of lawyers, who sometimes are more interested in winning a case, than in making justice prevail.
B001IMFHVG|5.0|Rubinstein at a peak in his career IMO. Even better than his recordings, this one you can watch his playing also. Like being there.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I decided to read The Hunger Games because of all of the excitement generated by the recent movie.<br />I was underwhelmed by this book.  It came across as very sophomoric.  I wouldn't recommend it to others.
1608871819|5.0|I love pic books like this, altho I wish it had more location photographs, &#34;behind the scenes&#34; photos. recommended anyway
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I love this interface. It's real easy to punch in numbers and get real enjoyment out of this game. I have also found their software updates useful, like penciling toggle button as opposed to having to select that for each box. The one thing I would like to see fixed is the problem where when you leave the game unfinished in a certain size then come back and finish the game the app brings you back to the smallest size possible to play for the next game.<br /><br />I would also like to see the scoring done better. It depends on time right now, but it seems to count time that I am not in the app thereby diminishing my score unless I beat the game in one sitting.
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|I loved the movie, but the music I found monotonous when heard as a stand alone. well recorded. two words
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Hey everyone, I'm here looking for ANOTHER Chromecast as I've really enjoyed using the initial one I ordered from Google so far. Suffice it to say it's a solid streaming device and an amazing value at $35. However, you can watch my video review at this YouTube address and enter to win one for free that I'm giving away if you'd like. Good luck and have an awesome day everyone :)<br /><br />[...]
B000FVRACK|5.0|these performances are superb, sound quality is excellent in the music, but in the extra 90 minnit special it is muffled and difficult to listen to. some EQ would have helped a lot.
B00CZAYL76|5.0|Might be my favorite cd of 2013. Absolutely no filler songs at all. Can't wait to see them tomorrow at Mayhem. Wish they would release volume 2 immediately
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I'd heard of the show but never had an opportunity to see it until recently.  I was hooked right away.  I also finished watching \\"Serenity\\", the movie afterwards and find myself wanting more.  Good job Joss Whedon and cast!
0061433063|5.0|I love all things Terry Pratchett and this didn't disappoint. Good pacing and peerless character development and, as always, excellent humor!
B004GYY714|5.0|I really like it ;) Everybody must have one in your smartphone, computer, table, apples, or other gadget. Ok ;)
B0033H7VI6|5.0|i dont know much about knives, but my son does and he absolutely loves this knife.  i know it is very sturdy material and it is very heavy.  he hasnt used it outdoors yet but he can't wait to use it.  he's very happy with his knife
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an awesome game. It's fun and makes you use your brain. It's just hard enough to where you have to think for a while but it's easy enough to figure out eventually. I would recommended for anyone that loves escape games. This is one of the best.
B0053FANPY|5.0|Was a good fast action and thrill<br />action movie, very cool.<br />For movie goers who like car chases<br />and action.
B00CM9JIZ0|4.0|On first listen, I was bummed. Second listen, I thought this might would grow on me. 3rd listen and I'm absolutely hooked. It's a great album but I have a HUGE problem with the mastering. It's too hot and distorted, which diminishes the whole experience. Big time. I just don't get why, after making such an awesome album - and they obviously had everything in place to make it sonically amazing working with Jimbo Barton - they let it be released like this. WTF? It's like bird poop all over a Lamborghini. Oh well - it is what it is. It's frustrating because you can totally sort of mentally hear it, or imagine it, through the muck. I demand a remaster! Who's with me??!!!
B00633W614|5.0|Can't say more about these books that I didn't say. Great read. Could not put down. From beginning to end it captures you
0062082353|5.0|Great read. I loved the history and perspective. Chris Kyle is a great SEAL, businessman, and family man. Recommended for any history, military history, or military buffs.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I am not a fan of these types of games. I just love watching Minions. However, my eleven-year-old grandson loved it and was immediately hooked.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|How to end a season. Season 3 definitely stands up to seasons 1&2, but I was really disappointed in the ending of the last episode. Still, I can't wait for Season 4!
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|This movie is just cool. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect but I was very pleased with this dvd. The animation is really different ( I mean that in a good way) basically it's a chameleon inspired spaghetti western! It's just plain halarious. Not entirely for kids but its got that slight of hand humor that goes over the little ones head while vthe adults love it. Bottom line is just buy it.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|I had watched &#34;Killing Lincoln&#34; before I watched &#34;Lincoln&#34; the movie. I thought it was rather &#34;slow&#34; and not nearly as exciting as &#34;Killing Lincoln&#34;. Maybe, if I'd seen the movie first I would have liked it better.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I check it out everyday. Every morning with coffee and most evenings. It tells me what I want to know.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Great actors<br />Fun fun<br />Just relax sit back and laugh<br />If you didn't like first seasons keep with it..it gets better
140006922X|4.0|As a Jewish Middle Eastern I found the portrait of Jesus very interesting.<br />Based on this book Jesus is a Jewish nationalist and doesn't resemblance to the image of the gentle shepherd cultivated by the early Christian community. I don't understand why some people would bring the subject of writer's personal belief in writing of this book. (Dispute the fact that Reza Aslan's mother and wife are both christian). Also I have to say that some of the negative comments are not only anti-muslim but also very much anti Jewish. It seems to me that some of readers are taking a personal side against Jews.
B00DU74U74|3.0|A lot of bad performances but Ronan and the guy who played the uncle did a great job. Worth watching for free
B00985E3UG|5.0|A great book that opened my eyes to America's battle against obesity and our giant food corporations that are running the country. It's a long read, but well worth it. America put down the extra cheese pizza and grab this read!!!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This is not a puzzle game that will have you confused for hours; this game doesn't aim to be that kind of puzzler. The puzzles are fun, unique and still lend you a feeling of accomplishment when done.<br /><br />As for the permissions issues, it seems to be fixed. The permissions are decent and don't seem to be pulling a lot of data off your device.
B00026ZG10|5.0|Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a U.S. Secret Agent - but his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) believes that he has a boring office job. They also have a rebellious young teenage daughter, Dana (Eliza Dushku). Helen is so bored with her life and Harry's descriptions of `another day at the office' that she embarks, almost by accident, on an `affair' with a used car salesman Simon (Bill Paxton). Harry overhears Helen and Simon setting up an assignation, so he brings the full resources of the Secret Service down on them to track their movements. However, Simon is trying to have his way with Helen by pretending to be a spy himself. So Harry drops in on their assignation and takes them both away for `interrogation'. As part of his undercover work Harry charms an Arab agent, Juno Skinner (Tia Carrere) who works for an Arab terrorist Salim Abu Aziz (Art Malik). There is plenty of action in this movie and quite a few witty touches. Overall, I would say it's better than Bond, James Bond.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story I  truly a masterpiece!  I was hanging on every. single. word. I am really into this type of genre however I would  recommend \\"Wool\\" to anyone who champions the good in every character and rejoices in the endurance  of the human spirit and it's will to fight.<br /><br />Well done, Hugh Howey.
140006922X|5.0|I have read many books about Jesus. This is refreshing take on his life and times. Well written and an easy read. This is NOT an anti Christian book despite what others have said.I am now reading his book \\"No god but God\\" about Islam.
B002W7P5UE|5.0|If you want an older movie that stands the test of time, this is it.  It has great acting, smart lines, and is great to watch...colorful scenes.  Loved it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Never having watched the series when it was in season due to having a husband who wasn't in the least bit interested, I chose to watch the series on my own via my Ipad and Amazon.  I love the quiet time just to watch something I can lose myself in and as always, truly enjoy British tv and movies.  The acting and writing is delightful!
B0013UIUBC|5.0|I have not received this movie, yet.  When I first saw it I really like it and wanted to add it to my collection of movies.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love having this on the go and being able to share notes with my husband makes for easy honey dos :-)
B000T433CO|5.0|I have not received this one, yet.  I have seen it and thought it was a very good movie.  I enjoyed it very much.
B003ES61EE|5.0|This is a great product to have at all times, at it makes lens cleaning a lot quicker, easier, and less of a hassle.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|This is a fun movie for  those who love this genre. It was enlightening too as far as ghost hunting goes.<br />I am going back to see it again.<br />And lucky me I also just won the Annabelle doll too from the promotional site that gave it away thought the hubby is not thrilled to have it in the house hahahahaha.<br />It doesn't get any better than that
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Went from simple complex, if you have to offer prizes to navigate the interface odds are its a not a good one
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|VERY AWESOME MOVIE WHERE THE REBEL CAN BE A HERO, AND HERO SHE IS...WAS GLUED TO THE SCREEN FROM THE BEGINNING
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun, would recommend. Keeps your mind ticking. Challenging. Not too easy not too hard just right. If you love puzzle games you will love it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|been playing for 15 mins. cool so far. horses are cute and stuff. game doesn't have any hiccups yet. good luck everyone!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I feel like it applied greatly to both my professional and personal life!  I loved the historical examples and medical cases given to help drive the book's points home.
B00846REIS|5.0|Wow!  What a ride.  This book is truly a page turner.  The characters are matched perfectly.  Love it.  A must read.
B007T99ENE|5.0|Loved this book, couldn't put it down.  Just a fabulous read! The style of writing is engaging, with terrific character development and plot.  Recommend as a great read.
0756407915|5.0|I couldn't be more in love with this series of books. The first one I devoured in a day. The second one I'm dragging out because I just don't want it to end. I'm not looking forward to the wait until book three comes out.<br /><br />Oh, and I found this book because I told someone I liked \\"The Deed of Paksenarrion\\", and they said \\"Well you might like this then.\\"
B009UZBLSG|5.0|I just picked up a brand new 2013 Google nexus 7 which I must say is one amazing tablet would recommend it to anyone. But anyway the new one has a Slimport slot built in. This baby works great! I'm a big Netflix guy and tv portal user (amazing app) this is as easy as it gets. Just plug it in the the nexus 7 hook one side up to the tv and plug it in and bam I'm streaming Netflix for the whole family to watch. It was worth the money and just what I needed highly recommend!

B00735HGQ6|4.0|Most enjoyable read! A story of one man's re-engagement with life and how that affects those around him. Good to the very last.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Unpredictable plot and really interesting characters; did not see the ending coming.  Looking forward to reading another book by this author.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Can't get it to stay on pages...can't get into my inbox..my old kindle fire worked great..I don't waste much time with this one for Facebook.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We really enjoy this movie!  It is funny and entertaining!  Can't wait for Despicable Me 2 to come out !
B007FIY3VW|3.0|I have not used it yet so I cannot really comment on it. Hard to write about a product you haven't used.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is one of the must see Christmas movies!  It is hilarious and very entertaining for the whole family!  Enjoyed it!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Large file size meant app took a very long time to install<br />  I gave up trying. Looked like a fun app.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|what can i say, i like the show and wanted more. i cant see how this show cost to much money and had to be canceled.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is pretty fun. Got it because I enjoy the minions an  it reminds me of temple run but with cuter characters lol it can be pretty sticky to swipe from left to right but you can get used to it, otherwise like it so far
B000FC1MOQ|4.0|In his brutally honest and compelling book, James Frey gives a detailed, first hand account of his drug addiction and his journey and struggle to overcome.  Motivating, inspiring, honest, powerful, and tearful are all words I would use to describe this book.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|A passionate moving love story. Loved it!!!!! One to watch over and over and over again just to &#34;sigh&#34; over Mr. Thornton.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|This should have a recommended age. I did not like this and it was difficult to understand how to play this game. I was very dissapointed with it.
B005GRF2UK|5.0|My No.1 favorite version of Jane Eyre. I own all the DVD that were ever made but always comeback to this one, LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Blu-ray is the way to go for classic disney movies.  We are going through and changing all of our VHS tapes to blu-ray if possible.  With a two year old, it is practically impossible for him to ruin the disc.
B0041VT6HW|4.0|I like this movie, not for kids of course but the honest man turn good fighting evil is always a good one in my book.  They also hade a little history in there lol good show.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|After having all of the other harry potter movies, this was a great deal and a must have for the collection.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved the first two books to this series,and I was ready for this book to wrap things up.  But it's another cliffhanger!!! The book was kinda a waste of time.  And it's hard saying that because I loved the first two books.  I just hope the next book is worth my time.
B003UESJFG|5.0|This is another good family movie.  Bad guy turns good by then end of the movie, which is not something you generally see nowadays.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I think that the game is just awesome I love the story and it is to easy I love this game
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I think I bought this for my mother in law to give to my sister in law.  Everyone in the family loves the movie and we enjoy watching the sing along version as well.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I truly enjoyed the book. I highly recommend reading it. Was a great inspiration and really makes one stop and think.
B004G6009U|5.0|I love this movie!  It's a great family movie to enjoy together.  I bought this for my husband and I and to add to our disney collection for when our kids are old enough to enjoy as well.
B008133DO8|5.0|This is an excellent series, and a great way to bring Sherlock Holmes into the modern era. I highly recommend!
B00821OX98|4.0|this is a very good sci fi series.there is a variety of characters, but they are easy to follow.typical sci fi.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|Some unexpected twists. Great acting by Rooney Mara. Didn't even recognize her from Dragon Tatoo. Don't remember this in the theaters, but if this is straight to DVD, than I need to see more of them.
B00BMQDM10|2.0|Although it is very funny in parts it was way too far fetched for my liking.The was an inordinate amount of action compressed into a very small time frame and I found that annoying and improbable.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|great movie, fast shipping
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I tend to like shows that are a little on the odd side and with characters that are unusual so this show fit the bill. I'm into season 3 and still enjoy suspending reality for a while and toodling across the universe with the good Doctor.

B001XUIBNO|5.0|Great movie, great sets. My father and uncle are in the credits for set designers. I loved all the old cars
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Lettie gave her life to be reborn. It is a gift, a story as old as time. It moves beyond linear thinking.
1476733953|4.0|I typically don't read this genre, however, look forward to the next book in this series.  This book has suspense and several admirable characters set inside an underground biome after humankind has destroyed the environment.  Compelling twists.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Love, love,love this series. I watched all 5 seasons in less then 30 days. It's addicting!! Recommended one to watch!
B005HED11Y|5.0|It had been so long since I watched Star Trek that it is new again .I enjoyed seeing them again . If you like good si/fi you will like it
B0031RS4UM|5.0|Non stop suspense right from the very beginning, all the way through, with a few surprizes along the way.  Loved it from start to finish.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|and you don't have a choice - it's the only way to connect your device to the TV. So, I think it's a cool product, but if there was a generic cheaper one available, I would have purchased that.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I spend way to much time playing this game.  I do enjoy it. I mostly just play random games, I would not pay to get rid of the ads they go by pretty quick, or skip them.
0783225733|5.0|I love movies and have an extensive collection, but I bought this for my granddaughter.  She loves Tom Hanks and can't get enough history and recent information about astronauts and the space program.  Because this movie means so much to her, I decided she needed to own it.  She had tears in her eyes when I gave it to her.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Love the case I got for my kindle, it took a while for me to figure out which one I needed (all my fault, duh?) Once I did get the right one, I just love it, it makes reading on my kindle so easy.
B0064Z62R0|5.0|Must have for your Hawaiian collection. Since I saw this movie I have been telling myself that until I saw it available.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie was great! Wonderful cast and some very funny scenes, Can't wait to see Red2!  II will probably watch Red again in the near future.
B00873GRU4|2.0|This is one of only two or three books that I've started and could not manage to finish. I'm a constant reader and have found some wonderfully written books by new authors on Amazon. What I'm completely unable to comprehend is how this book garnered so many 5 star reviews. The writing is tedious, the pace is glacial and the story couldn't hold my interest. The characters are one-dimensional and I couldn't empathise with or relate to them. About half way through the book I found that I simply lacked the will to continue. I guess I need to be more careful and always read a sample instead of trusting an overwhelming show of support in reviews...
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I don't really get off on violence being used for diplomacy. I understand why it was necessary but we never should have been in that country to begin with and, if I someone invaded my country, I would defend it.
B00C53ROSQ|4.0|If you are looking for a classic acoustic Iron & Wine album then this is not what you want. If, however you want a complete album with a smooth sound then this is definitely what you want. The horns back up everything fantastically. This is a great album and another infinitely listenable album that you should buy.
B0059DQHHI|5.0|I have seen probably 700-800 movies in my life so far, and this one easily ranks as one of the best 20 or so. It is a very intriguing story, starting out with a man running an orphanage in India. This quickly establishes the main character as someone you can admire and someone to root for throughout the movie. I first saw the main character, played by Mads Mikkelsen, in the movie Casino Royale (2006). He did a great job being the villain in that movie, and I can safely say I have a whole new level of respect for him. Not only does he speak a totally different language in this movie, but he is about as dynamic of a character as they come. You can feel how he feels being at the wedding, realizing that the &#34;daughter&#34; of the man giving her away at the wedding is actually his daughter. You sympathize with him being away from the orphanage and trying to build a bond with his newly discovered daughter at the same time. I'm not going to give away the plot, but this movie will keep you interested from beginning to end. It has a heavy dose of drama comparable to Legends Of The Fall (another one of my favorite movies). Some would call it melodramatic, but given the situations the characters are dealing with they do an extraordinary job and it is still realistic.<br /><br />I would consider this a &#34;light&#34; rated R movie. There is some bad language, although it was probably only a few steps away from a PG-13 in that department. There is a little bit of sexuality in the movie, but it doesn't contain any long scenes of it.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a fantastic movie that has a ton to offer. If you don't mind a good drama, I would highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game. Pretty straight forward, not too complex.<br /><br />Got this game as the free spp of the fay. Not disappointed
B000057DON|1.0|This album was of very poor quality. Right out of the jacket there is a divit, or impression of something that smashed the track. For being a new vinyl, this was garbage.
B00CJGP116|5.0|I have loved this man's music for many, many years.  Can't get enough of him.  So happy he finally made a new CD.  His voice gives me the chills.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game with nice graphics and motion.  However, there are a few too many adds.  They pop up after each game,  but they are easy to cancel if you are not interested.
B009WUBERW|4.0|I enjoyed the action.  Some of the scenes were a little cliche but overall great movie.  Good followup to the first movie.  I hear they are working on Expendables 3.
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|Complete protection, front and back! The flip cover has perfect 2mm wide slit cut-outs for the speakers, and is branded with the htc brand logo; black on black. The case provides deep 3mm protection for the camera and flash. Although I was concerned with flash distribution and vignetting of photos because of the deep ports, I have not seen either. The inside of the case has a feel and finish of soft suede in a contrasting red color. When the case is used as a stand a 4mm wide crease is created down the middle of the back. Time will tell if this will result in premature damage. Overall, this is a well designed, well executed case. It exemplifies quality. I will probably get one more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the most fantastic series I have ever watched. I am looking forward to Season 4 ;o) I will recommend it to everyone.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My granddaughter loves this game.  It is interactive.  She builds areas and collect animals and dinosaurs.  We are so glad we loaded it on her tablet for her.
020530902X|4.0|Another book I acquired for a school project. Was quite surprise by the content. Wasn't hard to finish in my spare time.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This book makes some great points.  I gained better insight into myself and, to my surprise, my husband.<br />But, starting from the middle and on - just too much - made your point and now time to end.<br />I am thinking that which makes this author &#34;Quiet&#34; also makes her go into just a bit too much detail.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Subway surfer is better. This game is very choppy and the a lot of missions involve inviting friend to complete, but don't have any friends...
B001FW2R5I|5.0|This band never dissapoints. Beautiful, melancholic songs. Great voice, impecable instrumentation. Disc 2 has demos of all songs, its allways nice to hear different versions from a song you love.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|Films are now at a point where no matter how cool the special effects are, that can't be the only driving factor.  I found the plot of this movie and the pacing completely cheese ball!
0679805273|5.0|Exactly what I was wanting. Hardcover copy of this book for a graduation present for my younger cousin graduating from college. She is a young single mom and thought she would really appreciate this.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I bought a used one on Amazon. 16.35 and it is brand new. Great deal and it works better then the specific charging cable from Plantronics. I use it as my main charger because of the Mini USB plug. Now I use the Plantronics plug with my spare charger. I agree with most people, it should come with the device.
B002WV5A9G|1.0|I dont even know why I am reviewing this product.. Dont even remember ordering it. Star trek 2209? i dont know
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The $10 cost is more than most apps but it's worth it if you like magic. Good amount of replay value..
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Like the boards, rewards n interaction with others. Don't like the cost for power n the way its done now.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|At first I felt quite uncomfortable with the suicide theme but gradually accepted that some people feel that there is no alternative in life. There were multiple layers of emotion on all fronts from expectations of all parents and peers, respect and love turning to loathing, young love turning into revulsion and the power of persuasion inthe nameof love.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun  I would pay 3.99 for this game it is similar to subway suffers but only has different scenery and aw some power ups .
B00CA3C1N4|1.0|I'm not much on this game, I guess I just don't know much about it. I believe my grandson would have to show me how this works. Some of these new games I'm not to sure about and this is one of them.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I think amazon.com: is wonderful everything about it you can order anything you want and get a great price I ordered books for my Kindle and I 1.991
1589795474|3.0|It needs to be updated ,the information extremely valuable.The results should be simmilar?<br />I would like to know if such is writen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game to play. I play this all the time and I love the different bosses you have to beat when you change places.And my nephew always plays this game.
B00AYR2FQ6|5.0|I am no music critic, so I will not attempt to review each and every track on this album.  But, I do like to listen to good music, no matter the \\"genre\\".  This is an album of good music that I think a lot of people will enjoy.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|This game is initially difficult to get used to.  No two games feel really the same as long as you don't play it on easy forever.  The different skills make game play different.  I wish we were able to get more skill points than 12, but It's understandable why they don't give more than that.<br /><br />Play this game on Easy - Normal for quick games and you can still enjoy yourself. :)
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|Carriger has constructed an interesting alternative timeline, mixing steampunk inventions and supernatural characters.  Her strong women are most interesting aspect of her writing, coping with male prerogative.  Interesting how these male-dominated societies so often have a queen, of one type or another, as ruler.<br /><br />Some of the later volumes are a bit thin in terms of advancing the story as much as the initial book.<br /><br />NOTE:  Sex is often an integral part of stories as in life.  However, much of the sex in the initial volumes is contrived, clumsy, skippable.  Its not strictly bodice-ripper embarrassing; but Carriger would be better off leaving more to the imagination.  Thankfully, she leaves out detail as the volumes progress.<br /><br />The boxed set is a bargain at $20.00 and well worth it.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This was a really good book. It wasn't as good as Gone With the Wind, which is the ultimate &#34;5&#34;--that's why I gave it a four. It inspired a very good and lengthy discussion among our book club members. Although we were somewhat frustrated with Harold's choices, we understood, liked the ending and appreciated the journey.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|The Mad Max movies are all great. They look spectacular. I also enjoyed seeing Mel Gibson when he was a rising superstar.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I thought this was going to be another room escape game.  It's not!  There are a variety of puzzles (some similar to room escapes) that you solve in order to obtain  pages of a magical book. When you solve one group of 8 puzzles you get a final puzzle, which when solved, completes part of a portrait painting and a part of the story.<br /><br />This game will keep you busy for awhile. Some puzzles are easy and some more challenging but so far they are not  too hard. Example: I kind of freaked when I saw one was Tower of Hanoi, but oh! There are only four disks. Easy peasy and quick.<br /><br />The sounds and graphics are great and this is a very enjoyable puzzle. I got this on the free app of the day, but I would happily pay for this puzzle.  It has  many unique, enjoyable and memorable puzzles that make part  of a greater whole. Definitely get this app.
0374533555|4.0|I got this book for my teen and she just raves on the activities in this book.  She states that the make her think and says wow I never thought of thinking like that.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|My three year old loves this movie. The story is playful and sweet, while having just enough suspense and action to keep a kid interested. Lots of fun musical interludes that my kid sings back as well. I prefer this vintage of animated movie over modern ones, as it's more innocent and less frenetic than titles released in recent years.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun and so addictive!!!!!  Love it!!!!  Runs great on my kindle fire..... wish there were a few more worlds..... but love it regardless.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Getting my 9 year old into Star Trek, the original series and she can't get enough of Kirk and the gang. Although I laugh when I see the old stage and the hilarious old-school costumes of the aliens, she thinks they look real! Great video, audio and narration. Great buy for a videofile.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|i want the old one back. this new &quot;upgrade &quot; sucks!! i cant even get on it anymore and i feel like a child using it when i actually can get on it. sorry uninstalling this app. please bring back the old one.
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|My 9 year old loves this movie. Her girlfriends love the combination of fear and the love story. They also love the little china doll and dream of a little china village!
0399242864|5.0|I can't get enough Oliver Jeffers' children's books.  My preschool class loves the pictures and the story lines.  Each book is entertaining and appropriate for young children.
B005LAIIMG|1.0|Brad Pitt running and shooting at things. That's about it.<br />ANY episode of the Walking Dead beats this dog by a mile.<br />The only thing it has in common with the book is the title.<br />Possibly the worst summer movie in recent history.<br />I can't express enough how much I hated this movie. Brad Pitt owes me $7.50. And a beer, possibly dinner.<br />It really was that bad. Save yourself.
B000005AYL|4.0|I love Erykah Badu. This girl has it goin' on.<br /><br />The vinyl copy of this album is not a complete copy of the Baduizm album!<br /><br />About the Vinyl version of Baduizm:<br />Upon purchasing, I thought that I was purchasing a complete recording of the Baduizm album, (the Amazon listing says that there are 14 tracks... I do hope they ask vendors to change that information in the future...), instead I received a record with only 9 tracks. A few very key songs are not on this album, not to mention that the record included radio edits (not album versions).<br />Though I prefer vinyl, had I known that the vinyl recording was different from the CD recording, I would have settled for the CD, this because I wanted all of the tracks as they were meant to be by Erykah Badu herself.
B008M721MS|5.0|great  app to be able to talk with friends and relatives all over the country.  cost nothing to use as long as you don't call a mobile number..
B0094M2O7C|4.0|plot is unique, kate excellent as always. I thought the daughter could've been played by a better actress.NEVERTHELESS IT'S WORTH IT....
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Wonderful game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!very addictive and fun!!!!!! Grown ups even love this game. Definitely fun entertaining. A must have on any device.
030759565X|5.0|Really nice cookbook with simple and easy steps to follow. I really like the pictures, colorful and bright. I would strongly recommend getting this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and amazing and it is real cool to play I enjoy it a lot and I hope that others do to
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show I'd watch this show anytime anywhere awesome show great characters and development the story line seems like it can go forever
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Of course the story line with the interweaving of characters is superb.  The social development from the Edwardian Age is fascinating.  The acting is worth 5 stars alone.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Can't stop playing it. It's fun and addictive, and easy to figure<br />out and play I would definitely recommend this game. Kids of all ages will enjoy playing.
B0000DJYQQ|5.0|I was super stoked to get this vinyl seeing as its my favorite stones vinyl! even more stoked when I opened it and it was a clear vinyl! played it over and over and over
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great addictive game.  Kindle Fire does get bogged down with processes and I need to restart often. Notwithstanding that technical issue, this game has given me several hours of entertainment.  Missions and PVP keeps the game interesting.  Thanks Gameloft!
B009SJ3H8Q|3.0|First time using amazon to d/l a movie or series. Let me say first that my dsl is not great so that may have lead to the poor quality of the picture. other then that it didnt freeze or have any issues to complain about.
B005544V6A|5.0|Suits is one of the best shows on T.V. It's funny and the suspense of what is going to happen next keeps me interested!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|this is a reeally really good..... I really love it love it I have an account and its awesome I recommend this to people.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This is a great movie to occupy a couple of hours of your time. Fast paced (most of the time) action dominates with some slower intervals used to explain situations and the interaction of the various egos in play throughout the film.  The story is a little &#34;out there&#34; so to speak since it revolves around the evil arriving from an alternate or parallel universe where Thor and Loki apparently reside.  Something like that.  But...who cares when you have so many of the Marvel superheroes fighting off an army of evil creatures flooding through a portal between the universes bent on wiping out the human race to gain control of...uh, well, I'm not really sure what they plan on dominating but it really doesn't matter since it's just fun to watch and you already know the Avengers will prevail anyway.
1451695195|3.0|I had hoped for a better idea of heaven after reading this book but found it to be no better than others on the subject.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I am glad I got this. I have loved these puzzles for years, so I was glad to see this app. I have not had any glitches on my Fire. I recommend it.
0399213015|5.0|I bought two cloth panels showing the caterpillar and the butterfly, then had to buy the book to see how the transition was done. I made a two-sided baby quilt with a stem and cocoon connecting them.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was skeptical about plot about kids killing each other in a game. But this is a movie about perseverance and making the most of a negative situation! I highly recommend this movie. It is engaging.....
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Harry Bosch stories all have a grab for the reader.  This one is a little different than other books.  It also has the hook that keeps you reading and the WOW ending.  Not one of the longer Connelly books, but a good read.  As always if you don't like rough language this book is not for you.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is nonstop action from beginning to end, and no special effects are required.  It's suspenseful.  The hero is an admirable man.  The plot twists and turns but never loses its way.  My only reservation was the graphic descriptions of uncommonly violent deaths...almost enough to make me queasy but never enough to make me stop reading!
B008OOYALE|3.0|It's a fun game but just not the best. For me anyways. This game required too much attention and I just couldn't do it. If you have enough time to play this game  go for it.
006178480X|5.0|James Rollins is the best of the best authors. Once you start reading his books you can't put it down.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|These are people I came to care about as well as a situation we all share.  I'd recommend it for everyone.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A wonderful read. I'm so enjoying the crossover series and can't wait to read the next book \\"Entwined With You!
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Everything takes so long to do. Not what I expected at all. I'm just glad you don't have to use actual money.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|When you start to play this it is frustrating.  The blow dryer makes the hair all crazy and go in different directions.  The spray bottles are fun though.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Creates a pretty decent edge quickly without needing any skill. I am not an experienced knife sharpener and it does a good enough job sharpening the kitchen knives.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You get train, feed, ride and take care of your horse.  Fun for me because I ride horses all the time.  I am 7.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|I love Alice in Chains. I would watch this again.  Very funny show.  Do not let the kids watch it with u.  There is adult scenes.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My granddaughter is absolutely crazy about The Little Mermaid.  This will be a good movie to add to her collection.
B000Z27HLS|3.0|A bit disappointed. For some reason, this version is missing small scenes from the version I saw on PBS. Do not undrestand why.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game My Horse is very fun and addicting I love It. If you are looking for a horsey game you shoulfe download this wonderful game.
B0027MJU00|5.0|A wonderful read! Hard to put down! Gillian Flynn does it again! Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is awesome I love it sometimes you meet people that are excellent artist it is a fun game trust me those who put 1 star are out of there minds
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|I love this game and it reminds me of gangstar rio and i think gangstar vegas is cooler but there are some things i don't like especilly driving because instead of sliding the i-pad side to side you have to press buttons that makes the game more boring and also the thing i don't like is that in gangstar vegas you don't walk to the store you just press pause instead of going to the store like in gangstar rio and the other thing I don't like is that you can't steal wepons but I still like gangstar vegas after all.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Kept you guessing as to who was real and who was dead<br /><br />Great acting and effects- Great old house excellent!
B000E9910W|5.0|Perfect...arrived as expected and promptly. Playing as I get ready to go to a Doobie Concert in the Northwest. Thanks.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|Modest price, timely delivery, new condition. Saw the recent version and remember the original from about thiry years ago. Will be seen when my daughter, now 58 visits, and will comment on the prior version.
140006922X|3.0|The book is nothing new or special. No bias and objective? I call BS.<br /><br />Why do people believe everything they hear or read especially if it is a huckster selling something? This book, like all such books, is simply the opinion and interpretation of the writer of the available source material and other peoples opinions and theories. The range of opinions and conclusions is all over the map.<br /><br />How can you be a Muslim and be objective about Christianity, especially if you teach and live in one of the most Liberal Progressive States and learning Institutions that embrace secularism? For that matter, all such books are biased in one way or another by the writers personal beliefs.

I am an expert with a Ph.D. in the history of religions . . . I am a professor of religions, including the New Testament-that's what I do for a living, actually . . . To be clear, I want to emphasize one more time, I am a historian, I am a Ph.D. in the history of religions\\".<br /><br />\\"Aslan does have four degrees:  a 1995 B.A. in religion from Santa Clara University; a 1999 Master of Theological Studies from Harvard; a 2002 Master of Fine Arts in Fiction from the University of Iowa; and a 2009 Ph.D. in sociology from the University of California, Santa Barbara.<br /><br />None of these degrees is in history, so Aslan's repeated claims that he has \\"a Ph.D. in the history of religions\\" and that he is \\"a historian\\" are false.  Nor is \\"professor of religions\\" what he does \\"for a living.\\" He is an associate professor in the Creative Writing program at the University of California, Riverside, where his terminal MFA in fiction from Iowa is his relevant academic credential.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was previously using a Razer Imperator and decided to try this mouse out when my Razer died. This mouse has about a similar shape as the Imperator and is slightly more comfortable with my grip style. Everything worked out of the box and set up was a breeze. The mouse is very light and even with using all of the weights that were included, the mouse still feels lighter than the Imperator. If you like even a moderately heavy mouse then you might want to get something else. My only complaint about this mouse is that you can only set up and switch between two separate profiles on the fly, more would be appreciated but isn't really a big concern.<br /><br />Overall, the mouse is very comfortable to me and the functionality is right on par with more expensive mice.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Wow. I'm at a loss for words. Beautiful. Awesome. Breathtaking. Grand. I wish I could read all over again. I will always treasure this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I absolutely love the Downton Abbey series. I would recommend this series to anyone. I just wish there were more episodes.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The picture quality of this download is fantastic! Easy to pause and fast-forward. I highly recommend this series as well!
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|The only reason I would give the game four stars is that it doesn't have a sequel. I literally finished all forty-four levels in under an hour... and I'm only 13! But I would really recommend it for younger kids, like ages seven through ten.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Sons and I enjoyed And the Mountains Echoed, but it was missing certain elements.  I did not like how it jumped around from character to character.  I was thoroughly entertained and read for hours at a time wanting to find out what happens to the characters, only to be let down by the terrible ending.  This book had the potential to be excellent, but it seems that Hosseini just ran out of steam at the end.
B004EF65QA|5.0|I have read the book and seen the movie, and I appreciate the changes they made in the movie, especially the ending. The movie was beautifully written and acted from beginning to end. It is a classic.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|Love this movie! Great family fun. Really love the humor in this flick and it tells a good story. (And this is to full the amount of words I'm suppose to say, lame Amazon)
1476733953|5.0|I loved the book and it was addictive enough to read twice.  It really did not seem so far-fetched for todays time.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|I tried it loved it so great that's all I have to say perfect for kids ages 2-6 non stop fun
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My family seen The Lorax in 3D version in the theater and it was really neat. When my kids seen this came out on DVD before Christmas they begged and begged for it. Thank goodness Santa Clause fount this DVD on sale for under $5 on Amazon.com. My kids were very happy Christmas morning.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|some reasoning required...overall entertaining and kept me looking around the rooms for clues or tools. I will continue playing and use more games from this maker.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Factory Balls is an Engaging app that tests your Creative side.  You get to Color, Paint, Decorate and Accessorize plain White Balls into all kinds of Fancy Designs.  The object is to Duplicate the exact design that is PICTURED ON THE BOX.  That can be challenging and makes you use Planning, Artistic and Creative Skills in a Fun and Entertaining manner.  Process is done by using many Tools that you just touch to apply.  An easy process if done in proper steps and sequence for desired result.<br /><br />Colorful Graphics are good, Music and Sound Effects are fine and can be Muted.  Controls work very well while using all items to make your Creation.  If correct, your ball will drop into the box and Next Level button pops up on screen.  Sadly, no way to view what Levels are available or how many are left.<br /><br />Overall, a good Creative Challenge style game.  Fun to play and Easy to master.  It is Simple and lacks many of the amenities we like to see in most apps.  Like a Levels Menu, an UNDO Button, a little Fanfare when creation is successful, etc.  A little SPRUCING UP could make it more enjoyable but it is still a Good App that keeps your interest and has good Replay Value.<br /><br />Thankfully, it has No Intrusive Permissions, Addons, IAPs or other Annoyances that I have seen.  It works as advertised and is Good, Clean and Safe Fun.  I Gladly Recommend it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This epic account reports the sharing of universal &#34;manners&#34; of war and their transcendence into times of peace for former adversaries.  It will bring tears to your eyes if you have a sense of history and character as times evolve.<br /><br />The message, along with a great story, is that we all have more to agree with each other than to disagree about, and common sense is never a bad guide to taking the right action.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is sooo awesome!!! You can find all sorts of fun facts and you can find awesome ideas and I mean AWESOME!!!! It is so much fun! GET IT TRUST ME YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!
B002SAUCBC|4.0|First Kindle book I read. Stephen King as always pulls you into the characters. Outstanding read for one of his first books. A must read for any King fan.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Love this game!  Again, would be even better if there were more instructions but even without them it's still fun.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|Pretty good<br />Not exactly life changing but a fairly challenging game that's quite soothing. About as stressful as a jelly.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The only time this app works anymore is if I complety power down and then turn back on.  Even then it doesn't always work.  Not reliable at all any more since the app was updated.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Product came just as described in the listing. My kids absolutely love this movie and watch it over and over
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Wy in the world would I want a help guide for a game which is unavailable for my Kindle? I wish you would take it back since it is useless until you can provide the game itself.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|it is so cool to be a shark and eat people and fish the background is so cool and descriptive and have toxic in the water
B009IF8CH6|5.0|IMHO, one of the best (most outrageous) episodes in TV history.  More PC violations than Carter's has pills.  (Now there is an expression that might take you back 50 years.)<br /><br />Now, you DO have to appreciate how clueless Sheldon is with regard to personal interactions BUTT (and it is a BIG but), he nails about 5 or 6 in 22 minutes.
B00DCX08MW|1.0|You will only get three things to do with the first time why won't they make the game cost $ then have ever plane cost $ don't get this game!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game I thought was going to be easy and not rrrally entertaining but it isn't. really makes you think lol. its a fun game.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Love this game. Every now and again it gets a little glitchy, but that's to be expected. I have it on my phone and my kindle and currently its the only game a play.
B008EEWN6I|3.0|Not the best from Serj but it is a likable album. Would really like to hear another System Of the Down album.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun my daughter really loves to play it! This game shows you how to take care of the horse and how much they really cost lol !
B0019CSXAM|5.0|This show is simply ADDICTING. I almost went on a buying spree of seasons, until I heard Netflix has them all! I had a weekend marathon with friends. We do not miss a show!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie. Has a little bit of everything into one movie. Musical, love, comedy and drama all in one!!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This movie obviously relied heavily on special affects,<br />but watching this movie you don't even care.  Your<br />imagination was taken over at the beginning of your<br />viewing this movie, and you are it's prisoner by mid-movie.<br />Loved the way the human interest aspects were strongly<br />centered and used in this movie.<br /><br />-Tim
0307950689|4.0|As always Dan Brown as kept my attention to the point I couldn't put it down!!  Definitly a must Read!
B0060FXBNM|1.0|one of the cds freezes for a momento and stops working and then continues working is only that bit in dark side of the moon.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|If only I had camera to capture my Grandson's face when he got his surprise. The non-disk movie accidently got erased from the cable so he hadn't seen it in few weeks, he's only 2 1/2 but just about knows every word. Also great because have Blueray upstairs & DVD downstairs so they can watch either way. Make sure you do order the Walt Disney version. Received right on time with no damage, love Amazon Prime.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Loved it.  I did think the author kinda gave up at the end, but it's still a great read!  Recommended.
B002USA7G2|5.0|I was looking for a nice hardcover version of Rebecca since it is one of my favorite stories.  I had a paperback copy, but I had read it so many times that it was literally falling apart in my hands.  This version has nice large print, it is hardcover with nice sturdy binding, and it has beautiful colored illustrations.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great Game! It seems like a game from a carnival and is very realistic. A must have game for anyone.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|It was a thrill to see the first season of Star Trek.  Helps to understand why this became the hit that it did.  There is much wealth of insight and futuresight in this wonderful series.  Worth the watch.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I was thrilled to see all of the detail, not only with the costumes ands sets, but the way everyone thought.  How the justice system worked.  What was exceptable or not in different classes.  It was thrilling to see how WWI made such a change in the way the world worked.  How the estates were run.  It was such a history lesson and yet there was so much drama.  I was glued to the screen.  By the end of this season I was in tears wanting to know how the family was going to go on.<br /><br />I can't wait until next season!
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I am spoiled by Downton Abbey, but this is worth watching for British history lovers, this goes to the years leading up to the second world war and the famous abdication of an English King!!
B009GX69RK|5.0|First episode I saw was kinda quirky, kinda interesting. But since then have completely fallen for this series... I love how it makes me laugh so hard... So good it makes me want to punch you in the face
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book, great imagery... Decided to read it after watching the movie.... I just don't like how the chapters are divided... Other than that a must read!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Comedy, sadness, romance, all in one movie! I loved it! I had so many emotions going on through the whole thing.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|youtube was working then it stopped. so we got this, and now our youtube us working just fine. be glad when they figure out everything and we don't have to have these work a rounds.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is a great app . So far so good.  I would recommend this app to every one. IT gives you all the information you need for several days.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I missed the last 3 seasons on fox, I'm glad Amazon has the ones I didn't see, and since I have Prime I can stream them for free which saved me over 100 bucks
B00CLMA3HK|5.0|I read Aurora Conspiracy in two long sittings.  That's how good the plot was.  Couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I am not usually a big sci-fi fan, but the story in the book supersedes genres.  It's a good story... period.  Full of action and cliff hangers through the whole book.  The characters were deep and readers will not help but identify with them and care what happens to them.  Well done!
B008LY9AWG|4.0|I like Connelly anyway and these are perfect reads for the gaps between the big stuff.  One does not have time to forget what happened at the start of the story!
B004GYY714|4.0|it's easy to use and lots of choices.  When I'm not able to access a car radio or ipod or CD player, I usually have access to my Kindle and music is readily available.
B009HEMF1M|5.0|This movie is pretty original and the action scenes are very good.  I'd recommend this movie to those who love action with a little romance.. John Wayne would approve.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show. I enjoyed it a lot.  My friends kept telling me to watch it and now i'm glad I did.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Stop thinking about it. if you buy this you wont regret it.you have never seen planet earth like this. Enjoy!
B0093WVND4|5.0|This book is brilliant! It brings team work in and I love how they don't need a compass and know from front to back. If there were a book 2 for this magnificent book I would love to read it. I would recommend reading if u haven't. Just think what other book has talking animals and cruel farmers and underground villages and who would go several days in tents just to kill a Fox. And they worry about animals eating there stuff just give up u will get that Fox. Or maybe u will. ;-)
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|Predictable but cute. The minions are the only characters that made this Film remotely interesting. Otherwise, not a new story at all.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It is amazing and it will have me playing a hole day on the<br />Game.but I had to buy the the other diseases and I can't finish bacteria<br />On norm
B009DH2PP4|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this book when I decided to get into home brewer. He recommended both this book as well as the Brewing Network pod casts with John Palmer and I was not disappointed. It's a great read with everything from the simple steps to the complex chemistry of the whole process. I highly recommend picking this one up.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Great movie full of witches and lots of action two thumbs up it was one of the best I've watched
0878162437|5.0|My dad showed me this when I was about thirteen, and I must have read it five times since then. McCloud goes in-depth into ideas I didn't even know existed about comics, and I&#34;m still surprised by those ideas every time I re-read this book.<br /><br />My personal favorite part is the chapter on panels, where McCloud introduces &#34;blood in the gutter,&#34; the choice to have action happen between panels, rather than straight-up show it. He gives the example of having an ax being raised in one panel, and a scream in another. He points out that every reader is sort of an &#34;accomplice&#34; in the violence; we all had to imagine the crime in our own way, since we didn't get to actually SEE it happen.<br /><br />Or as McCloud puts it, &#34;Each of you held the ax and chose your spot. To kill a man between panels is to condemn him to a thousand deaths.&#34;<br /><br />You ever just have to stop and read something again because it you had to make sure it was really that awesome? That chapter right there, that BLEW my MIND when I first read it. And the whole book is like that.<br /><br />Buy it. Borrow it. Whatever, just read it. If you've ever read a comic book in your life, this should be required reading.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Great movie full of witches and lots of action two thumbs up it was one of the best I've watched
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|My expectations far exceeded what this book delivered...easy ready but boring, not as interested as I thought it would be coming from someone as funny as Tina Fey
B008602KQI|1.0|The film editing was choppy and downright terrible.  I also thought that most of the plot twists were forced and contrived (e.g., the fireballs;  the sudden creation of the terror-dogs; etc.).  In addition, there was little to no chemistry between the female and male leads -- they just were not a good fit.  I don't know how many ways a movie can be messed up, but HG has got to be a classic of how not to make a movie in any film-making school.  I downloaded it free with Prime, but I think I paid too much.
B00123MBGA|5.0|This is the &#34;first album&#34; by the Grateful Dead. Phil Lesh, Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Bill &#34;the Drummer&#34; Kreutsman, and Ron McKernan, &#34;Pigpen&#34;. I hope I have spelled the names right. I first heard this album on AM Radio around 1967. KIRV 1510 AM in Fresno, Ca. Why is this important? Back in the 1960's and 1970's radio was great. AM and FM. There was much music to hear. This is a very important recording. I downloaded it. I used to have the record, I wore it out. If you notice the songs, many are the bands versions of what they liked to play the best. Good Morning Little School Girl, Sitting on Top of the World are very old blues and folk/bluegrass songs. My faverite song is Cold Rain, and Snow. I just can not get enough of that song. To me, this was one of the most important recordings made. While it was the &#34;First&#34; for the band, it would be very popular today. The whole band is great. I love the harmonica, organ, and lead guitar playing.<br />Don't forget the bass and super clean drums as well. Good music, and they don't make them this way anymore.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I would have to say that this is the best novel I've read since Neal Stephenson's \\"Cryptonomicon\\" (which is my very favorite novel).<br /><br />It reminds me somewhat of both Jeanne DuPrau's \\"The City of Ember\\" and Robert A. Heinlein's \\"Orphans of the Sky\\", both excellent stories. But that comparison does not do \\"Wool\\" justice, as it is a highly original novel in its own right, and I do not wish to give the impression that it is derivative in any way. If anything, it is superior to both of these. (And that is saying a lot, given the high esteem in which I hold Heinlein, and \\"Orphans of the Sky\\" in particular.)<br /><br />\\"Wool\\" tells the tale of a subterranean \\"silo\\" set in a post-apocalyptic earth where the surface is uninhabitable for (initially) unspecified reasons. The origin and history of the silo remains a mystery, one that is central to (and one that is revealed, at a *tantalizingly* slow pace, throughout) \\"Wool\\" and its sequels/prequels. The characters are complex and believable, the story is gripping, and the setting of a bunker-type silo is extremely interesting. Howey is an evil genius at playing the reader like a fiddle, revealing enough at a time to keep pulling you in while leaving enough a mystery to keep you scratching your head. This would make for an incredible movie someday, especially as Hollywood is so bogged down in making remakes and weak follow-on's to previous movies.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this novel highly enough. Any serious sci-fi fan should read this.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME BUT YOU DON'T GET TO BINGO MUCH BUT I PLAY IT EVERYDAY I LOVE THAT YOU GET TO SEND GIFTS TO FRIENDS AND OTHER PLAYERS
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I just can't stop playing this great game.  I am totally Addicted to this App, and so is my daughter!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I could not stop playing this game. I loved the different puzzles and how they all combined into a great game. Thank you.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Very good movie! Lots of good action and laughs. Hell, my wife even liked it!  See it then see the second Red!!!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is very easy to use. You can select any version you want to read. If you want to read the same scripture in another version you just touch the version you're in and it gives you a list of other versions to choose from. If you  need to go to a different chapter or book you can touch the appropiate place and you're there in an instant. It has a place for notes if you want to keep them. Also it is very portable to take with you anywhere you want to go. Of course for me the best part is the fact that this is the living breathing word of God. It is ageless and a book for all the ages. I'm sure it has even more features but have not totally explored the other options. I will get much use from this one.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|We love this movie and appreciate the convenience of having it available on our Kindle. One more reason to LOVE my Kindle Fire!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Will keep the whole family entertained. I would recommend this game to anybody that would play it. Awesome game never gets old and keeps u entertained
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|I read this book in one sitting and I love it! I'm a big fan of Neil Gaiman so I was already disposed to like it but it is very good, nonetheless. Magical, scary and very engrossing. I thoroughly recommend it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Absolutely worth paying for. The graphics are stunning in this challenging, well thought out game. I'm eagerly awaiting more levels.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I haven't actually played it yet but I already know that it will be great by looking at previous games by gameloft. anyways, for those of you complaining about storage the only thing you have to do is one simple thing. I called customer support and they told me that you can clear up more space if you go to the quick office app and select browse files. then just go through and delete any files from old games that are already deleted and things like that that you don't need anymore. Trust me it works just please stop giving good games bad reviews for nothing.
B004SIP8JI|4.0|If you are a romantic you will like this movie.  I especially am a fan of Meg Ryan and<br />Hugh Jackman is always good.  I have watched this twice since I got it.  I would<br />recommend this for all women especially.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|This book empowered me with what I've been thorough- excellent read<br />Right down to the nitty gritty details, thank you alice, for reminding me I'm not alone!
B008LFY6NI|4.0|Easy to use, lots of color choices, no sparkles.  That was a disappointment.  Great fun to keep a little kid (or yourself) occupied, and it's quiet!
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Does Jeremy Renner replace Matt Damon?  No. That doesn't mean it's a bad film or otherwise not worth seeing, it is.  However, I DID NOT like the fact the film involves the use of chemical enhancements, used by the assassins Bourne and Renner play.  It's like the movie \\"Limitless,\\" but with a military, special forces, type edge.  I think movies depicting the use of performance enhancing drugs are sending the wrong message to our youth. There are remarkable action scenes, as you would expect.  I liked the way the movie didn't try and make Renner out to be Bourne.  The director made it clear that they're two separate characters.
B0018OFN4U|5.0|Goofy but good.  If you like Zombie movies you will probably like this movie.  If you liked Monty Python style humor you wont be disappointed.
B00BJTGVTK|5.0|What struck me most about this book was the variety of the stories. Short story collections by the same author are often the same story repeated multiple times in different settings and with different characters. Not so in this case. Julia kicks off with a story along the lines of those in the Goosebumps series by RL Stine. She then moves onto a fable type story and progresses from there. Each story is unique and creative. For younger readers still finding their feet in the world of literature and not quite sure of what they like to read, this is a great place to start. I recommend this for school teachers trying to entice young readers to read. There is something for everyone in this book.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I like the graphics and the interactions of the dragons.<br />The game loads really fast and also the menus and the market features are easyvto use I really enjoy playing it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is.awesome unlike temple run this game all u have rondo is.swipe your finger instead of turning your device.I love this game and always will.you should download.it I give.5 stars:)
B008602KQI|5.0|I choose this movie because I never saw it before.  I did not know what to expect.  The story line was laid out well in the beginning and the action kept me at the edge of my seat.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Try it out. Fun game. Only thing bad is the whole energy thing. It's not a Facebook app. Other than that, enjoy your horse.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|its also on the computer on coolmath so finnaly I can play factory balls on here instead of the computer
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a master piece it is a very entertaining game I enjoy every second that I play it I cant wait for the next update
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is so much fun. my brother has it on the I pad and he has the good version. I give it 4 star because it takes a lot of loading and downloading.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A totally compelling, beautiful story about one decision that echoes from generation to generation.  Hosseini is a gifted writer who vividly brings Afghanistan's landscape to life.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|i FOUND THE BOOK INTERESTING,BUT TOO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT HIS MISERABLE WAY OF TREATING PEOPLE. i GRANT YOU HE WAS BRILLIANT, BUT MUCH THAT WAS CREATED BY APPLE WAS DUE TO OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|good story good actors a movie that told it the way it was back in those days.. a shoot them up movie.
B00009R86L|5.0|GREAT shoulder pad! Perfect shipper/seller! I would order again in a heartbeat and give another five stars. So many uses for this product.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|thumbs up I gave it this rating because thrilling action movie didn't blow me away but was good worth watching.
B004LLDN3A|3.0|Video was not clear to watch online. I have an HD monitor and the picture was not crisp or clear.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Have Seasons 1 & 2.  Couldn't wait to get Season 3.  Probably the best PBS series I've seen.  Abbey marathon this weekend!
B00BQPEIT2|2.0|This game is frustrating due to over ambitious programming or something. Slows down and speeds up, causing frustration and failure. Other Temple Run does great, no other game acts like this.
B000T433CO|5.0|Great movie and music. Also there was great chemistry between the various couples. It's a Christmas movie but it can be watched year-round.
B0068RHSCW|5.0|The movie is absolutely excellent so I mailed it to my family in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  Thank You it was everything and more than I imagined!
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|There was no connection with any of the characters.  There was not sense of the calamity. The characters were bland.
B000093BDX|5.0|Got what I wanted just a couple days later, awesome service!<br />I will continue to order my music here w/out hesitation.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I'm not sure what I expected when I began reading, but it wasn't what I read; all the same, I couldn't put it down. Interesting story, really sucks you in!
B00AYB16EO|2.0|it's not that i didn't like the movie.....i just could not SEE the movie.  it jumped and stalled and wiggled around in a most discouraging fashion.
B008S2BZ10|4.0|With this cast and director how could you go wrong? One thing I like about this movie is it has a very good story and it's not drown out by special effects. A must see for Sci Fi fans.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|and it came thru brilliantly.  great movie too, though i thought they'd never get out of the shire.  three movies from that one slim book seem problematical to me, though.
B007REV4T8|5.0|First of all, let me just say that comparing the newer bonds, Craig included, to Sean Connery is like comparing a modern, finely tuned Lamborghini to an old 60s Mustang. Both are wonderful, but very much different in their own way. To me personally, no one can ever compete with Connery, but Craig's portrayal and Skyfall are probably the best things that have ever happened to bond since the 60s. Casino Royale was excellent, but Quantum of Solace fell short because there simply was too much emphasis on the action. They might as well have called it James Bourne. But Skyfall is a true jewel and a fitting 50th Anniversary film because it has all the \\"Usual Refinements\\" of a great Bond film while being a thoroughly modern, refreshing take on a legend, with a gripping story and a truly mind-blowing ending. Javier Bardem, in particluar, plays without a doubt the best bond Villain since Blofeld, no question about it.<br /><br />If you've given up on the Craig Bond films because, like me, you were too appalled by Quantum of Solace, I urge you to give Skyfall a look. It truly has turned the tables for the franchise and it has brought Bond back into being the thrilling symbol of cool that he once was. Let's hope he can stay that way.
B005PK57NU|5.0|OMG. This series has it all and always leaves you wanting more. Did the season have to end? Can't wait to get my hands on Season 4.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Love it! The idea is intriguing, the plot line keeps twisting, and I can't wait to watch more. Great series!
B008133MDK|5.0|Creative, suspenseful, so clever and well written with magnificent performances. I enjoyed the scene with the question marks surrounding 'wiman'.  Quite accurate yet inventive. I look forward to season 3--there's no stop now!
1451626096|5.0|Henry Tudor came off the battlefield the victor, having defeated Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth. He now wears the English crown, but there's no real sense of victory for him. It's much the same for Elizabeth, a princess of the powerful House of York and the former lover of the now-dead Richard III. Having placed her faith in Richard winning the battle, when he's defeated, she loses not only the man she loves dearly, but also her place as the future queen, which she and her family believed was safe. Henry and Elizabeth marry soon after as part of a truce negotiated between the families --- he to show his loyalty to England and she to show loyalty to the new monarchy. Neither is happy with the arrangement, but happiness isn't something with which they can be concerned.<br /><br />Even though the battle has been won and Henry now wears the crown, plots to overthrow the Tudors and bring the Yorks back to power abound. Henry is completely distrustful of his wife and her family. He keeps all of them close but can't stop the rumors of a York prince waiting for the right time to emerge and claim his crown. Henry is suspicious of everything and everyone, especially after having to put down several rebellions, and learns just how disliked he is in the country. Elizabeth, married to a man she can't stand and trapped in a political marriage with her own family plotting against her, has no one to turn to --- not even her own mother, who would denounce her if it meant returning the throne to York hands through her son. When the rumors of a York prince become a reality, Henry once more runs out to stamp down rebellious plots, and Elizabeth is left hoping that the person her husband will surely bring home and denounce as the York prince is not the brother she thought was tragically lost.<br /><br />If you're interested in Tudor drama full of backstabbing, deceitful people, then this is your book. There are some very unlikable characters in drama-filled situations in THE WHITE PRINCESS. Henry and Elizabeth are distrustful, resentful and hateful toward each other. Their relationship started out poorly and gets even worse before they're married. Even when he tries to be kind, she lashes out. Elizabeth has spent her life being loved and adored, easily able to charm people with a smile. Henry has no idea what it means to be likable and spent his entire life fighting for a throne and a people he doesn't seem to like and appears almost incapable of understanding. The relationship is a rollercoaster that never ends.<br /><br />Henry's mother, the main figure in his life and the only person he fully trusts, is using her son's position to take what she feels is hers by right, but sadly she's only ever viewed as the mother of the usurper king by the people she's looking to outdo. And Elizabeth's mother is plotting against her own daughter. Think of that what you will.<br /><br />There's so much drama, court intrigue and war in this book, but you don't see a lot of the outside world due to the fact that it's so focused on Henry and Elizabeth. Sometimes it's almost easy to forget that anything besides their hateful marriage is going on. However, it's Elizabeth's focus that makes this book so interesting. She may not leave the castles in which she has become imprisoned as a powerless queen, but she is incredibly likable and you come to love seeing her throw sweet yet hateful comments at the king and his mother. As the mother of what is to become the most recognized Tudor in history, Henry VIII, she holds little back when she finally realizes that she has nothing left to lose.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've read a Philippa Gregory book, and THE WHITE PRINCESS has made me want to pull up a few from her backlist. If you're a fan of her Cousins' War series, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one. Drama starts on page one and doesn't stop until the last page.<br /><br />Reviewed by Amy Gwiazdowski
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Wonderful application. I really enjoyed playing with my pictures - designing the frames and adding accessories....time just pass without getting bored. I just love it!
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Loved this movie!!  Gary Coopers speech in the courtroom is right on!!  I am so glad Ayn made sure she had a say in how the movie was put together.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great program. like the features, and the updates.  I would be happier with more frequent updates, but it does not change my rating.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|The movie was visually beautiful so it would get 5 stars for visual effects. But as a whole it reminded me of the book  &#34;The Old Man and the Sea&#34;. It's long, and about 75% of the movie is just the young boy out at sea, and that was a surprise to me. It's worth the rent if you have time.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Absolutely worth checking out if you like action, drama and history! I don't believe I've ever scene anything like it on TV and film footage is beautiful, well made and the acting is top notch!! I'm a little bummed that the next season is sooooooo far off though. Expectations will be high if they're going to make us wait this long!!!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|Downloaded this supposedly &#34;free&#34; kids' game for my 8 year old nephew who was visiting.  The free game wound up costing me $114.00 in downloads that the child was enticed to order as he played, until I noticed the activity and shut off the credit card on my Amazon account.  Thankfully, Amazon was willing to refund all of it.  BEWARE of your settings if you order this game!
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|This is a very good game or simulation that will keep you on the edge of your seat for sure !
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|What I like best is there are numerous games.<br />If I get frustrated on a level in one game, I can move to another for awhile.
B00821PCJS|5.0|The casting for the show is excellent and the storyline moves along well.  I have really enjoyed watching it.  One of the best SCIFY shows I have seen in awhile!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is so good I love all of the characters<br />It is a mixture of comedy and drama. Entertaining!!
140006922X|5.0|There seem to be quite a number of born again cretins who have not read this book 'reviewing' it.<br /><br />A good book, try reading it instead of the relentless propaganda.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|It was great! If you like the Percy Jackson books then you will like the Carter Kane series. a must read book!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is the best book series I've read since reading the Harry Potter series!!! It's a page turner and I love it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun for the whole family. Easy to understand and to go to the next task. Keeps you busy with the tasks you need to finish.
B008NF45S2|5.0|Wow. After trying 4 other print apps, I found this one that works ... so far flawlessly with my android devices (samsung note 2 &amp; nexus 7) &amp; my ipod touch with an epson wireless printer.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This movie is one every adult should see...it has a great cast, great acting, based on a true story which makes it even that more awesome! It has action, suspense, drama & has humor to boot. Gives you a glimpse into prison life that will stay with you forever.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Easy to use.  I like having a widget for reminders.  My only regret is that my phone (samsung note 2) appears to be one that doesn't allow the widget to scroll.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My Husband and I are now hooked on this series.  It was such a fun way to pass the hot afternoons of Texas summer!  Excellent series!  Can't wait for Season 4!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|The author keeps taking Sigma on new adventures, and this latest is one of his best. A must read for any Sigma fan, and even if you're not!

0785151303|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1971MXZPZ58O4]]This book includes hundreds of great images, including:<br />- Thor comic book to screen comparisons<br />- Costume designs for Thor, Loki, Odin, etc.<br />- Dozens of various designs for Thor's hammer<br />- Asgard city and technology concept artwork<br />- The Destroyer design<br />- Jotunheim landscapes and creatures<br />- Frost Giants and their weapons<br />- Theatrical Movie Poster designs<br /><br />*Please see video for detailed photographs from the book [music is from the Thor soundtrack].<br /><br />**I would recommend you purchase the Hardcover Edition of this book.  The pages are soaked with colors as well as black backgrounds, so there is a lot of ink.  The hardcover editions seem to have thicker pages, but many who own the paperback have complained about thinner pages which causes distortion.  Also, the book is quite heavy, and having a hardcover allows you to better control the book while flipping through the pages.  So it may be more expensive to purchase the hardcover edition, but I think the increased quality is well worth the extra cost.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It is very well thought out. Nothing is given to you, it requires thought unlike a lot of other games of there. Defiantly a game to play twice even after beating it. The 2 dollar price point is a great value for the immense quality of the game. You went regret it.I'd recommend this app to anyone. Well my smart friends anyways lol
0785153322|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2A7HNJNRPM8OX]]This is a set of four art books from Marvel movies.  Each of the books was sold separately, although you'll find that it probably cheapest to buy them together in this bundle.  Also, the thick outer slip box is exclusive to this set, as is a folded poster that's included as well.  I own the Hardcover Editions, and would recommend that version - although a bit more expensive, it's higher quality and will be easier to control.<br /><br />These books are big and heavy, and the pages are full of vibrant colors.  Photos are mostly high quality.  The images used in the books includes conceptual artwork, paintings, and CG models.  You will also find plenty of set photos and stills from the movies.  There are also marketing/promotional materials, such as movie posters.  One of the great things about these books is that there are a lot of alternate designs/art that did not make it into the movie - so you can see how the production design progressed over time.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />Below is a detailed list of the imagery you'll find in the books:<br /><br />IRON MAN - [[ASIN:0785143270 Iron Man: The Art of Iron Man the Movie (Graphic Novel Pb)]]<br />- Iron Man suit concept art<br />- Photos of the Iron Man helmet and other pieces of armor<br />- Iron Monger concept art<br />- Jarvis/HUD<br />- Tony's Workshop & Malibu Home<br />- Stark's cars/jet<br />- Storyboards from various sequences in the movie<br /><br />IRON MAN 2 - [[ASIN:0785143203 Iron Man: The Art of Iron Man 2]]<br />- Stark's Hall of Armor<br />- The suitcase suit progression<br />- Stark Expo concept art/logo designs<br />- Whiplash concept art<br />- Hammer Industries weapons - Army, Navy, Marine drones<br />- Black Widow & Nick Fury costume designs<br />- Storyboards of Stark Expo drone attack sequence<br />- Stark's Monaco car and racing suit.<br /><br />THOR - [[ASIN:0785151303 Thor: The Art of Thor the Movie]]<br />- Thor comic book to screen comparisons<br />- Costume designs for Thor, Loki, Odin, etc.<br />- Dozens of various designs for Thor's hammer<br />- Asgard city and technology concept artwork<br />- The Destroyer design<br />- Jotunheim landscapes and creatures<br />- Frost Giants and their weapons<br />- Theatrical Movie Poster designs<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA - [[ASIN:0785155090 Captain America: The Art of Captain America - The First Avenger]]<br />- Captain America comic book art<br />- Costume sketches for Cap, Peggy Carter, Howard Stark, etc.<br />- Dozens of various designs for Cap's Shield<br />- Details of Steve Rogers transformation<br />- Red Skull design concepts<br />- Hydra weapons, including cosmic cube<br />- Hydra vehicles - tanks, train, airship, etc.<br />- Theatrical movie poster designs<br /><br />*****<br /><br />This set includes every art book from Marvel's Phase One, except for \\"The Avengers\\".

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I got it so my granddaughter would have something to do when she was with us in the store. I figure I would try it out first. I got hooked on playing it. I learned real quick you have to be fast to play it. ( hahahaha ) I really like this game and play it every chance I get.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|The opening of this film, where Conan emerges from the womb of his pregnant mother (who's been knifed in the belly by a warrior) is a palimpsest of what the Japanese soldiers did to civilians, frequently, during the Rape of Nanking, an event experienced within the memory of living men and women (1937-8). Unlike the Arnold S. version of the first Conan movie bearing the same name, this version of Conan is gritty and horrific. Whether or not it's more or less in alignment with the original Robert E. Howard concept of the character is unclear, and probably irrelevant. Movies are not books. In any case, this is a solid, atmospheric fantasy of the Sword and Sorcery genre, and well worth a look.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Great story. Again, Grisham's talent to pull you in and keep the point as close to the end of his book as possible.<br />Had fun reading it.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|Such a classic film.. Really holds up to the test of time .. Can't go wrong watching this one, it's awesome
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Jumps all over the place and does not create 'real' characters. Has no real storyline either. Its somewhat boring reading...
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I found problems accessing Full Facebook from my tablet.  It was not loading the pictures and was running slow.  I am not sure if it was this version or facebook period.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Free  is great for this game. I think that if it had better control for the character it would be a lot more fun. Over all a great game for the kindle.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|The only thing that would make this book get rated worse by me is if he had changed Reachers name to Tom Cruise and shrunk him likewise. A slow read that I kept expecting to pick up, I am still waiting. Reacher is my favorite series still, but I hope Lee Child returns to what got him where he is with the action he showed us in the earlier books.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|don't miss my concole much with this one. at first thought it was glitchy but it was just my connection
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! My bros and I play it all the time! Still cannot figure out how to use realms, but overall, very cool.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|It gave me a ry different perspective on women... And as a man, I strive to have more respect for women at the workplace
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Everyone (the cast) were sharp, sassy and a wee bit rascally, though there were scenes I felt went a wee bit too far with the 'teasing.'
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|my wife got me into this and now i cannot complain but im not on either side i like it all
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is really good. The graphics and puzzles are amazing. I like that is mind game. I will buy some of the same game.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Barbara Streisand gives a professional performance, she's believable as the mother. Seth Rogen is great too.I loved the ending, I thought it was unexpected. But a happy one at that, and I love happy endings.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is my fourth time reading this beautiful trilogy. That should say it all for anyone reviewing this book. Just like a very good movie. Can't wait for the movie by the way. I am just praying they are able to do the book justice. This trilogy has the potential to be the best love story to date. Those of  you in doubt, give it a shot. It gets better with each book. I hope Mrs. James continues to write. I would support. Just would hope sh would release  the  whole story at once,  being her books are not books  you want to wait to read. It was  hard to put the books down even with this being my fourth time reading it. Loved it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Now that you can use it with Apple iPhones or iPad I use it all the time, but they need to add some more features/apps you can only run Netflix & You Tube.<br /><br />Save your money. What a waste of money, I can do the same thing woth a HDMI Cables. Save your money.........
1931559317|5.0|No amateur astronomer should be without a copy of this atlas...easy to interpret and use...great viewing outside under a red light!!!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My family loves this movie. They would watch every day if I let them. It is great family entertainment. Wish there were more movies like this one.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Funny. Sarcastic. And filled with DRAMA! It keeps you going from episode to episode.  Can't stop watching until the season is actually over and even then I'm not done.... on to SEASON 2!!!! HAHA
B00DHNJGCU|2.0|The action was very predictable.  The script was poorly written.  The acting was ok.  I would wait for it to be available for free on Prime.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this TV series and this season was great!! I would recommend this show to anyone who likes a good drama and comedic series.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I like playing bingo in  my spear time at doctor office at home before I go to work this great
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|everything was so well done.  Hulk was amazing, battles epic yet funny.  all around fantastic movie.  only downside is that captain america was a little lame in it.
B001JIHGO0|5.0|I love this movie. Action packed with beautiful girls and terrifying immortals. Hugh Jackson does an excellent job as a vampire slayer.
B004G606K8|4.0|Loved this series when I was little and loved it again now. Dragonlance practically defined the high fantasy genre when it was written. If you love escapism, fantasy, and a fun read that isn't going to depress or bore you, check it out.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|very cool idea for a game/brain game, helps the kids with spelling too.  very satisfied with this purchase, but i figured I would be as its a reputable author
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My youngest grandson loves this game.  I just got my Kindle the day he came over and that's all she wrote! lol
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll lllllllllllllll l  l lllllllllllllllllll llllll lllllllll llllllll lllllllll llllllllllll llllllllllllll llllllllllll lllllllllllllllll llllllllll llllllllll m  m  m  mm m
B003F1WM2K|5.0|Not what I was expecting! Totally inspiring, surpringly interesting and so much of an awaking! I have so much more respect for the both of them!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was captivated.  Could not put it down. very stimulating and fun. Hours of entertainment.  Highly recommended. Can't wait for the next levels to come out.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Good book from start to finish. I read the books before my 10 year old son so we could discuss it. I learned a few things about Greek lore.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Again appreciating the older view on things.  Another Bronson - vigilante get even deal.  Of course Bruce and crew are wonderful.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love this game! I have always enjoyed playing this game as a kid. The only downfall is there should be a way to earn coins to play besides scratch off and buying them. I like the ability to change the background or cards. The different challenges are fun too!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|If you enjoy the stars - you will love the movie.  Going through these issues right now with elders, added the necessary humor to get me through the day.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is very fun and deffenently addicting. The graphics are great. The only thing is that the items you must find are very small and hard to find other then that the game is mad fun.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|John McClane was not John McClane. The action was not Die Hard action. The characters were like cardboard targets on a shooting range. They should have called it ' A Good Day To Kill A Die Hard Franchise'.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The graphics  are great! The games great! I'm addicted  to it now! I mean it reminded me of temple run, but this is  SO much better!  I &#60;3 it!!!!!!!!!
