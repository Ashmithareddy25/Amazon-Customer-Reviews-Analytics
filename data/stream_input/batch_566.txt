Few sequels include The Grim Reaper singing!<br /><br />  Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as Bill and Ted.  George Carlin returns as Rufus.<br /><br />  Be excellent to each other and party on!
B000066SJZ|4.0|I have the original vinyl pressing of Toto IV and I also have the SACD multi-channel pressing of Toto IV.<br /><br />Here's a fact - the multi-channel area of the SACD is richer, crisper and fuller than the vinyl. What a beautiful job Elliot Schriner has done with this recording, as he also has done with the REM - Out Of Time DVD-Audio and the DTS 5.1 release of Sting's Brand New Day.<br /><br />Absolutely gorgeous. The last reviewer of this item was obviously not listening to the SACD portion of the disc. If you have an SACD compatible player I can highly recommend this item.<br /><br />EDIT Mar/2009 - having since replaced the record player I have to now note that the vinyl is really fantastic, but the multi-channel layer is where this release excels and as such I will find myself continuing to choose the SACD over the vinyl. ES' surround mixes are just wonderful.
B000AAF276|4.0|This is not a rockin Eric Clapton CD but it is an excellently sung listening CD. <br /> <br />Eric Clapton's singing will surprise those who carefully listen to this very personal CD. It is Eric Clapton's vocals that highlight this work. Eric Clapton lists his influences in the CD booklet and states that these artists have taught him to listen. From the results in this CD we hear that Eric Clapton is an excellent listener. <br /> <br />Eric Clapton's guitar work is exeptional as always but does not stand out like his vocals. Mr. Clapton's playing is very good as always.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I live in Malaysia not America. Although never been to the land of plenty myself, the cowboy/western 'subculture' has always been part of western entertainment fed to us on TV/movies. And the prevalent of wearing Levis, Wrangler jeans amongst us always been associated as the 'cowboy pants'. Cowboys are the embodiment of machoism, and Marlboro ciggarettes are the most consumed import what more with the sharp featured cowboys higlighted in the ads. <br /> <br />The first time I watched the trailer I thought that it is going to be heartbreaking.Tru enough I was right, but i did not expect it to be affecting me emotionally for days which I am still recovering. I never thought a MOVIE could break my heart just like my first love did. I never thought Brokeback Mountain could open up old wound and leave it bleeding for days again. But it did. No movie had ever done that. I can't imagine any movie that could do this again. <br /> <br />I was searching everything and anything about brokeback mountain like searching for a lost love. I was secretly wishing that Jake will come alive again for a sequel....yes...i had gone insane after watching this movie. I was in a mess, I couldnt do anything right. I couldnt figure out whether it was the fictional Ennis del mar that I fell in love with or Heath Ledger himself. I can't figure out how to describe this visceral, surreal, ethereal feeling. I have watched plenty of great movies  that moved me (recently the gay movie from Quebec C.R.A.Z.Y which almost recounted my early days living in suburbia) but Brokeback Mountain is different and totally a different league in its own. It didnt just move me...it pushed me off the orbit. <br /> <br />I may be describing how this movie affected me rather than the movie itself. But that could go on for pages.  <br /> <br />In a way I am quite delighted to know that a movie have shown that what I've experienced in my life is not unusual...that all the mess I had to endure previously, someone shared.And all the response it received from men and women all over the world reiterating this fact. <br /> <br />But I am deeply sad too of the content of this movie for it just lingers in my head with a question if I will grow old, bitter and lonely in this land traditional Asia....that can never except a man who loves another. It's simply a sad fact, that while Ennis had to endure the heartbreak moments only until the 130th minute ended in the cinema, I am thinking that I will have to endure this my whole life. <br /> <br />Thank you all for reading. <br /> <br />

Nor does he seem to carry any arrogance towards his audience. <br />He is insightful and authentic. <br /> <br />So many of theses people write book after book trying to convince you you need them.  Tolle rises above this.  He even in a subtle way calls these people on this clear conflict of interest. <br /> <br />He is a true pioneer for a higher consciouness.
6301966562|5.0|What's the holdup?  Is it because it has a Virgin label on it?  Why is this movie not on DVD?  I don't normally write about anything, but I must for this one.  This movie has a great soundtrack, great song, \\"Together in Electric Dreams,\\" and San Francisco cinematography.  Plus, Virginia Madsen's on it.
B000003CMB|5.0|I was fortunate enough to be a young teen when \\"rock and roll\\" really exploded - everything was new - wow did we have a variety to choose from!!!  This album is no doubt among the VERY finest mix of \\"Southern Rock\\" and blues.  It's well mixed, well written, and well arranged. I can't find any reason to say anything bad about it at all.  If you are looking to collect gems from the 70's, this has got to be among them!!

B000000W5N|3.0|Several Stones albums were on my recommendations pages, and for the life of me, I can't figure out why.  I have never been a Stones fan.  To me, the only real talent they have is Kieth Richards and even he is VERY limited in what he does on guitar.  The rest of the band is what I call \\"generic\\"  - they aren't above average talent wise.  Maybe I'm wierd, but Mick Jagger's voice bores me, and watching him grosses me out.
B000BEZQ18|3.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" deserves every kudo it gets. But this CD functions as little more than a quickie souvenier. Main culprit is Gustavo Santaolalla's interludes, which, while working handsomely as interludes and bridges in the film, get samey and repetitive as solo listening experiences. But this will be the place for two great songs, Emmylou Harris' Golden Globe winning \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\" and Willie Nelson's \\"He Was A Friend of Mine.\\"<br /><br />The secondary originals are Rufus Wainwright's \\"The Maker Makes\\" and Teddy Thompson's \\"I Don't Want To Say Goodbye.\\" As for the non-original material included, only Steve Earle's cautionary tale \\"The Devil's Right Hand\\" is appropriate.<br /><br />Frankly, if you're looking for some music that more accurately captures the feel of \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" I'll recommend the music of Mark Weigle here on Amazon, since he is an openly gay singer with folk and country leanings. As for buying this CD, I can only give it a recommendation if you must posess all the gear connected to the film.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Demon Days. Wow. Already it's echoing in my mind like the title of a sappy soap opera. Just staring at the front cover makes me wonder what I'm getting myself into. A cartoon band? Hah! The idea of it makes me want to stick my head in a bowl of Jell-O. The debut was great but really? Won't they just pull a sophomore slump and end their career? Even thought I'm saying this now, I realize I'll be smiling by the end of the album, whether its from ridicule or enjoyment. <br /> <br />Intro <br />Oh my god. <br /> <br />Last Living Souls <br />Now that I'm thoroughly disturbed from the intro I graciously accepted this song for what it is. Amazing. Yet if a cartoon is talking about how he and his other cartoon buddies are the last living souls...then what does that make me? <br /> <br />Kids With Guns <br />Killer bassline, awesome percussion ending, definitely a song you can gyrate to. Though I'm concerned about what the songwriter was thinking when he wrote this song. \\"Kids with guns kids with guns taking over it won't be long?\\" Never give a kid a gun, please. <br /> <br />Dirty Harry <br />Ooo this song makes me want to dance. The rap is awesome, the funky beat is so...funky and the children's choir did a wonderful job singing. I don't particularly understand why its called Dirty Harry though. Maybe the songwriter was thinking dirty thoughts about Harry Potter or something, who knows. If you've ever seen the music video for this track please don't dance like the lead singer unless you want the people around you to choke on their saliva. <br /> <br />Feel Good Inc. <br />This song is so hot it could give any man a stiffy just thinking about a girl dancing to it. This is and will defiantly be the most popular single (U.S. anyway, Dirty Harry was the biggest in the U.K.) and has such an awesome music video. Del La Soul did an awesome job with the rap. The laugh was so cool too. I wish I could laugh like that. Then I'd make myself laugh and I wouldn't be able to stop. <br /> <br />El Manana <br />After much dictionary flipping I finally figured out what `Manana' means. So really the song means The Later. I guess it kinda works but why didn't they just call it The Later? Geez, sometimes people try to make things so complicated. Either that that, the song is really nice. The string instruments in it make it such a better song I think. It makes me think (since its going to be the next single) what the video is gonna be like. <br /> <br />Every Planet We Reach Is Dead    <br />Wow. This song can get annoying. Great beat and everything but yeah. It's kind of like the movie Grease. You can watch it once and then for the love of summer NEVER again. Please. <br /> <br />November Has Come    <br />This song gets annoying too. It seems that Demon Days is sliding down the ramp. The only good thing about this song I'm willing to say is that the lyrics are well written. <br /> <br />All Alone <br />I can't get enough of those cute little voices saying `All alone.' And then the beat comes in and you're like \\"Damn, this is one funky song.\\" And then the rap comes in and unless you like rap the song turns into \\"Meh, whatever. On to White Light\\" <br /> <br />White Light <br />Zzzzzzz...white light....zzzzzzz......alcohol.....do do do.....white light...WHOA! There are actual lyrics to this song? Somewhere in the middle some chick's voice starts singing something about closing your eyes when there ain't no light. Wow, that was deep. <br /> <br /> <br />DARE <br />Damn! Where have you been all these years Shawn? Finally! Maybe this album will end on a good note! Awesome song with the guitarist Noodle singing a song about `pressing it on you and predicting it.' Yeah okay so once again the whacked out songwriter is at it again but this is an awesome dance track with our favorite talking head Shawn Ryder. <br /> <br />Fire Coming Out Of A Monkeys Head <br />Erm...yes...I totally understand this story about `happy folk.' Definitely the darkest track of this kooky album. Please 2D, don't sing about dances of the dead. You'll scare little children out of their Sponge Bob pajamas. <br /> <br />Don't Get Lost In Heaven <br />Meh. Didn't really dig this song. I won't waste words. <br /> <br />Demon Days <br />Finally! We reach the title track, Demon Days. It's a nice mellow choir song with heartfelt lyrics. I really like it and its one of those underdog songs that end the record so well that you don't really have to say anything.  <br /> <br />So I reach my conclusion. It's an awesome album despite the ridiculousness of it. It's definitely worth buying and listening to continuously. If you want to put it on your Ipod make sure you buy the deluxe edition with the extra DVD. (unless you buy it off iTunes) Now go buy the album and geek out with the Gorillaz. You'll be glad you did.

Batman Forever and Batman and Robin were some of the worst superhero movies I haver ever seen. Batman Forever is not comepletly terrible but Batman and Robin was a peice of trash. In Batman Forever and Batman and Robin they were tring to make them funny and it made the movies just turn out plain bad. I sure wish Tim Burton would have directed Batman Forever and Batman and Robin because he did a great job on Batman and Batman Returns.
B0002IQHZM|5.0|I first listened to this CD with my wife in the car as we were driving the Mass Pike on a sunny Saturday morning, heading for Maine.  I didn't quite know what to expect this trip, but I was not prepared for (and yet pleasantly surprised by) this deeply sensual set of tracks.  Just amazing!  Donovan can still turn it on, approaching 60, and his voice is as timeless as ever, perhaps even smoother in his late middle age than ever before.  \\"Love Floats,\\" the lead-off track, is an outright seduction; \\"Yin My Yang\\" sounds like a Tao-themed come-on ('twould make Confucius blush!); \\"The Question\\" is groovy and mystical with the Hammond B-3 low and secretive in the mix.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that my wife and I could not stop touching each other while this CD was on, and were it possible for us to pull over and make hot, passionate love before continuing on, we'd have left the key turned to Accessory so that this music could have continued contributing to the sexy mood.  Lastly, I'll add this--if you bring home a date and put this album on, and you *aren't* making breakfast for them the next morning, something went dreadfully wrong!  Danny Thompson's sinuous bass work and Jim Keltner's tasteful drumming keep the whole thing moving along to your inevitable climax...pick it up today.
1400032717|4.0|Christopher John Francis Boone is a 15 year old autistic boy who lives with his father in Swindon.  Christopher goes to a school for \\"special\\" children, and is one of the smartest children at the school.  The book begins with Christopher finding a neighbor's dog, Wellington, dead in their yard with a fork sticking out of it.  After being mistaken for the perpetrator, Christopher is released and sets out to find out who killed Wellington.  The quest to find the killer of the dog leads Christopher on a journey that has consequences that he or even a normal child would have trouble dealing with.  While not really a coming-of-age novel, the book does follow Christopher through an extremely difficult, emotional time, and does a good job of showing how he deals with his feelings of confusion, fear, and loneliness.<br /><br />The one really great thing about The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is how Mark Haddon successfully puts the reader into the mind of a brilliant, yet inhibited, autistic child.  We get just as frustrated as Christopher does with the facts that he can solve almost any math equation he comes upon, but he can't figure out how a simple subway system works.  To be able to understand things beyond many normal people, but also not be able to understand things that a normal small child could understand easily.  That is the main thing I got out of this book.<br /><br />The book also spells out the importance of family.  Christopher might think he is independent, and he might feel angry at his father sometimes, but he truly needs his love and support, and Christopher knows that deep down, he just can't help himself.<br /><br />Having said all those good things, this book was just not really the book for me.  It is very well-written, and very easily read, but the subject matter just wasn't really up my alley.  Throughout the novel, I was continually frustrated by the tangents that Christopher goes off on.  Obviously, this is purposeful by Haddon, to try to truly put us in the mind of an autistic child.  Like I said, though, it was frustrating for me to read through, and I felt like it hampered the development of the plot.<br /><br />I have never personally dealt with an autistic person, but I feel, after reading this book, that I now have a much better idea of what people who suffer from autism are going through.  And it would be easier for me to understand why they do what they do.<br /><br />I recommend this book, but it is by no means \\"normal.\\"  And I guess that's the point.Haddon, to try to truly put us in the mind of an autistic child.

0596009208|4.0|People have different learning styles.  If you would prefer a dense techncial manual when learning a new language this is not the book for you.  I have learned languages that way and usually, early in the process, you reach a point where a key concept is only explained one way, that one way is just difficult to understand, and you spin your wheels.  <br /> <br />The Head First approach presents the same material in a few different ways, giving the user more than one chance at achieving understanding.  It is not for everyone, but I do think it is for most.  As someone that knows programming, but does not know java, I was able to skip over several pages of this book, but I appreciated the graphical elements of the book when I got stuck.   <br /> <br />I did not work in notepad (as they suggested) but rather downloaded IBM eclipse (it is free) and had work colleagues that I could ask questions of when I got stuck (important part of learning a language, IMHO).  I could not make the MIDI example make a sound.   There were a few other technical gaps. <br /> <br />I do recommend this book for most people that want to learn java.  I certainly recommend it for people that find they need more than the first three chapters of the nutshell books.
B0000542D2|5.0|Without a doubt, this is the finest rock and roll film ever made starring the finest rock and roll band. What makes this double disc DVD so special is that it features an interview with director Richard Lester as well as never before seen newsreel footage and countless other rare gems from the Beatles history. Some question if there would have been an MTV without this 1964 film. The answer is a definite yes. It's just that the Beatles were so phenomenally innovative, it's arguably the first music video, which has been a tremendous influence on nearly every rock and roll feature since. The Beatles just happened to start the movement 17 years before the video channel debuted. This is a must for any fan of The Beatles and a must for anyone who appreciates groundbreaking filmmaking. We should've known better!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Actually, this is one of the best soundtracks I own. I had it shipped from Amazon before even seeing the movie (still haven't seen it by the way; it shows in theaters over here this March) and it is great. It makes me anticipate the movie even more. :)<br /><br />The score is so soft and beautiful. Everyone who's heard it with me likes it (even those people who don't normally like classical music), and those who adore classical music love it.<br /><br />It's hard to pick favorites here; everything's wonderful. I adore \\"A Postcard to Henry Purcell\\" (so beautiful yet so simple).<br /><br />All in all, a soundtrack not to miss.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|i saw rent the very week it came out and i was blown away. it was something else, instead of average musicals, it had rock music in it. i was surprised that many reviews were below expectations but from what i saw i thought it was good. mainly the film is about eight bohemians going through one year or five hundred, twenty five thousand, six hundred minutes from the opening song 'seasons of love'. now, i thought the songs were good but i felt that four really rocked the house. the first is seasons of love, it really helped set the begining mood of the movie and the set were it was...brilliant. the next was the rent song, it was a kind of message as to what people go through with rent. the next which is my favorite out tonight, rosario dawson brought the house down i felt she was even better the vega (i listened to the play music) but thats just my opinion. the last i liked was the without you piece, very heartbreaking and very well done. so see this rock house film.

At times, the author's style seems tongue-in-cheek. However, as she herself is English, this is simply a manifestation of her tribe's trait not to be seen as being too earnest and, while the subject is to be taken seriously, not too seriously.<br /><br />In what must have been a prodigious research effort (yielding 416 pages of small type), Fox characterizes English behavior and attitudes as they relate to weather, social small talk, humor, linguistics, pubs, mobile phones, home, queues, transportation, work, play, dress, food, sex, secondary education, marriage, funerals, religion, and recurring \\"calendrical rites\\" (e.g. birthdays and holidays). Within these categories, Kate addresses everything from the pets and jam to the furniture that the English favor. And, since class consciousness is irrevocably embedded in the national social fabric, all is explained relative to the various classes: lower- and upper-working, lower-, middle- and upper-middle, and upper. As an example, when it comes to one's automobile:<br /><br />\\"A scrupulously tidy car indicates an upper-working to middle-middle owner, while a lot of rubbish, apple cores, biscuit crumbs, crumpled bits of paper and general disorder suggests an owner from either the top or the bottom of the social hierarchy. (Further,) the upper and upper-middle classes of both sexes have a high tolerance of dog-related dirt and disorder ... The interiors of their cars are often covered in dog hair, and the upholstery scratched to bits by scrabbling paws.\\"<br /><br />Kate's observations stress the importance of self-effacement, fair-play, moderation, compromise, courtesy, modesty, desire for privacy, polite egalitarianism, irony, ambiguity, and hypocrisy in English behavior. However, to me, the single most important concept to be absorbed from WATCHING THE ENGLISH is that of \\"negative politeness\\", which explains the notorious English reserve, and:<br /><br />\\"... which is concerned with other people's need not to be intruded or imposed upon (as opposed to 'positive politeness', which is concerned with their need for inclusion and social approval). We judge others by ourselves, and assume that everyone shares our obsessive need for privacy - so we mind our own business and politely ignore them.\\"<br /><br />After all, one mustn't \\"make a fuss\\".<br /><br />I myself was born in Milwaukee. My paternal grandfather emigrated from central Europe, and his family was German-speaking. Yet, as I read this book, my reaction was: \\"Wow! That describes me perfectly.\\" Perhaps this is because I was an Englishman in a previous incarnation or, more plausibly, because English values persist in the core, WASP, sub-culture of the country descended from the thirteen, original, Anglo-American colonies.<br /><br />WATCHING THE ENGLISH is a must-read for anyone who loves England, and is an obligatory duo with Jeremy Paxman's THE ENGLISH: A PORTRAIT OF A PEOPLE.ratched to bits by scrabbling paws.\\" <br /> <br />Kate's observations stress the importance of self-effacement, fair-play, moderation, compromise, courtesy, modesty, desire for privacy, polite egalitarianism, irony, ambiguity, and hypocrisy in English behavior.

B000002H2Z|5.0|Depending on whether or not you count 1983's \\"Japanese Whispers\\" as an actual 'non-compilation' album, \\"The Head On The Door\\" is either the 7th or 6th proper Cure album since their 1979 debut \\"Three Imaginary Boys\\".  Originally released in August of 1985, \\"The Head On The Door\\" left no doubt whatsoever as to who the main creative force in the Cure was:  Robert Smith.  Regardless of what other members came and went, The Cure's very existence rested squarely on the shoulders of Robert Smith.      With \\"The Head On The Door\\", it appears that Smith decided, for once, to acknowledge that he essentially WAS The Cure--Smith has sole writing credit for every track on the album instead of the usual crediting of all the members in the band at the respective time (I don't mean to imply that Smith's fellow band members NEVER contributed any songwriting ideas to the band).    The resulting album is an absolute classic that also marks yet another key turning point for the band.    Smith had already begun to demonstrate that the Cure weren't going to get pigeon-holed into a single style and that their sound would evolve over time.  Unlike earlier albums such as \\"Seventeen Seconds\\" and \\"Faith\\" which, as great as they are, are very uniform in sound and style, \\"The Head On The Door\\" is an impressive mixture of various stylings, and yet, every track contains that unique, distinct Cure-ness to it that we know and love the band for.  Another thing is that none of the songs here reach the 5-minute mark, HIGHLY unusual for a Cure album--a majority of the songs are even under 4--but don't let that mislead you into thinking this album is a crass 'pop-rock sell-out', because, with the quasi-exception of \\"Inbetween Days\\", it simply is NOT.    Most of the songs are absolutely terrific.  As usual, most of them are also either creepy, haunting, and mysterious, or some combination of those three.  \\"Kyoto Song\\" has a fittingly Oriental flavor to it with its percussive melody and droning arpegiatted guitarwork, and it features Smith layering his own voice magnificently.  \\"The Blood\\" mixes flamenco-styled guitars with an Indian flavor that evoke images of a desert--extremely fitting since Smith make references to mirages in the lyrics.  The waltzing \\"Six Different Ways\\" is a really fun, whimsical-sounding tune matched to highly mysterious, and rather cartoonish lyrics.  The uptempo \\"Push\\" is a surging, exhiliarting song with ringing guitar and piano interplay and a great opening riff.  \\"The Baby Screams\\" is a great example of the Cure's attention to arrangement detail--an ominous, uptempo tune stuffed with catchy hooks and soaring Smith vocals.  \\"A Night Like This\\" is simply a great, supremely tuneful minor-keyed pop-rocker.  The bouncy and 'dementedly'-cheerful \\"Screw\\" is great fun, built around an infectious fuzz bass riff.    And then the best is saved for last.  Well, considering how great most of the songs are, it's not really fair to say \\"Sinking\\" is THE best song on the album, but it's a particular personal favorite of mine.  It's an absolutely wrenching minor-keyed epic arranged to perfection with a thick bass line, a swaying rhythmic feel, contemplative guitar washes, rippling pianos, and soaring synthesized strings. And Robert Smith brings the song to an almost overwhelming outpouring of emotion.  Again, a great example of the Cure's increasingly elaborate, lush instrumental arrangements, this song points straight down the road to \\"Disintegration\\".  It'd be somewhat tempting to give the album five stars just for this song alone--well, you probably see what I mean.    Ironically, the only two songs that are slightly disappointing are the two hit singles.  \\"Inbetween Days\\" is an undeniably catchy pop-rock song that totally lays the groundwork for \\"Just Like Heaven\\"--the latter of which is perhaps their most well-known song--but \\"..Days\\" has kind of a nagging \\"we're trying for a hit single\\" vibe to it with its obvious lyrics and somewhat sugar-coated feel.  And the funky, starkly-arranged \\"Close To Me\\" is marred considerably by Smith's 'heavy breathing' sounds that run throughout the song--otherwise it's amusingly 'spooky' and a lot of fun; and it's worth pointing out that the single mix of \\"Close To Me\\" does differ considerably from the album version (there are no horns on the album version).    So, a couple minor gripes here, but by all means, the positives steamroll the negatives.  For any serious listener, \\"The Head On The Door\\" is  a hands-down must-have album from one of the best bands of all time.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|As impossible as it may seem, Plant sounds totally fresh on this album.  \\"Another Tribe\\", \\"Shine It All Around\\", \\"Tin Pan Valley\\", and \\"All The King's Horses\\" are the best tunes here.  If you let it, this album will take you on a fantastic trip.  I suggest you book  your ticket.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|For all the people complaining about \\"covers\\", buy a clue. Most of the songs Sinatra sang had been previously recorded by other artists too. Buble does a wonderful job of breathing new life into these classic songs. They're certainly far better material than most of the garbage being written today. I like \\"Home\\", but let's face it, Porter and Gershwin's tunes are far more likely to be remembered (and performed) 100 years from now.
B000006TRV|5.0|I can't add much to what has already been written about \\"The Wall.\\"  It's just a spellbinding piece of work.  Every music fan should own this one.  Also, this is the Floyd album in which Toni Tennille sings background vocals - - that in itself makes it totally cool.  Just buy it!
B00005JKGZ|3.0|I'm not a fan of Hollywood musicals, but this is a good one.  A three star rating from someone who really hates Hollywood musicals is a compliment.  Consider the source, namely me.  Despite the fact that it is a musical, this is worth seeing.<br /><br />The phoniness, the irrelevancy, the lack of substance, the idiocy, that I associate with musicals, isn't in this one.  What we have here is a good storyline and good acting, with songs that don't always interfere with the plot.<br /><br />The most annoying thing about the writing is the lordly power of the autocratic father of the family.  On the other hand, as Chris Rock correctly observes in one of his comedy routines, fathers don't get any respect these days.  Their efforts are completely taken for granted, expected, unappreciated.  Thanks, Chris, you are absolutely right.  Not so with the lord of this manor.  It was a different generation with different values.<br /><br />When the father in this movie gives his family heartbreaking news, that they are leaving St. Louis and all the friends and loved ones in their lives, he expects everyone to remain cheerful in his presence as they bow to his authority.  I find that very strange.  And a bit phony.<br /><br />His callousness is later melted when he sees the tears of his youngest child, but for some reason he feels he must maintain the authority of the father, and remain an autocrat as he announces his latest decree. What is that all about?  Why must men be autocrats?  Nonsense.<br /><br />The women in the film are painted as boy-crazy.  It's a pretty strange world view.  Silly girls, constantly plotting to ensnare handsome rich boys, and the autocratic father who rules.  Well, what do you want.  It's just a musical. A very well-performed one.
B00005JOFO|5.0|A challenging movie that is obviously not for everyone.  I admit that I thought the story was un-filmable -sparse words being so vital to its charm. While I did find the pacing of the near silent first scenes disarming at first, I was quickly swept into the picture and transported. As the closing credits rolled I felt that I had just witnessed something politically important and cinematically poetic. The stunned silence of my fellow viewers made me think that I might be right. Ang Lee made a movie that refuses to capitulate to trend in any way.  Beautifully shot and languidly paced over a twenty-year span without the MTV style quick cuts movies have adopted to the detriment of most. No bombast, no gratuity. McMurtry and Ossana beautifully fleshed out the tale just enough to capture the spirit and soul of these people trapped in a hell worthy of Sartre. The sparseness of the script allows the audience to fill in the spaces with their own interpretations, creating an engaging experience.<br /><br />Heath and Jake create memorable characters by leaving much unsaid - true acting.  Ledger is stunning - made more so by his virtually disposable mainstream performances prior to this - as his every utterance seems an effort to express something while giving away nothing. Gyllenhaal builds upon the stride forward witnessed in \\"Jarhead\\" and leaves us curious as to what comes next. His ability to convey Jack's recognition that his future could never be as romanticized as his past is beautifully conveyed by only his stare as Ennis drives off.  Michelle Williams' performance of a woman who knows too much too late is revelatory -putting her embryonic years at the Creek behind her - finely balancing a role that could have easily become unsympathetic while recognizing the nuance of victimization. Hathaway, while having little screen time, slips beautifully out of her fluffy tiara persona into a crown of thorn and captures her character's evolution from young Texas spitfire to aging brass beautifully as she truly becomes her daddy's little girl turning brittle from the deprivation of a storybook ending.<br /><br />I'm surprised to see some reviewers focusing on this film as one that glorifies lies and adultery and I have to wonder if we saw the same movie. What I saw was a cautionary tale of the pain and chaos created when one is unable to or refuses to reconcile with what they face in the mirror - a glorification of nothing. This is not a \\"gay cowboy\\" movie nor is it a \\"gay\\" anything movie. It's a spiritual movie about everyone's need to find his or her place in the world. Whether you choose to do it with an evangelical theory of God or with any other equally important reference is part of that journey.<br /><br />Many take issue with the film's one true sex scene as being either violent or too graphic. This opinion seems a bit short sighted. It's no more graphic than what is seen on network television at any given hour. Certainly the manner in which it unfolds is not a true example of all gay sex acts since not all gay men live on a mountain and it's no longer 1963. I think neither Jack nor Ennis had time to buy candles or flowers. These men were not \\"gay\\" in the modern sense since, again, it was 1963.  The film clearly sets the stage for the viewer to understand their slowly growing friendship not with words, but with carefully staged scenes that provide insight into the evolution of the relationship.  In case they are missed, it's all there in Ennis' declaration of \\"Hell, that's more than I've said in two years.<br /><br />Jack, as sexual predator is a ridiculous notion: While obviously being the more experienced of the two, let's not forget that it is Ennis, not Jack that returns to the tent. The tenderness that follows obviously shows that this couple is not just about the sex act.<br /><br />I would hope that everyone walks away from the film with a renewed appreciation for who they are and the realization that life is far too short to waste. As I read the majority of reviews posted, I suspect that this point was not only well made by the film, but also well taken by its audience.  As this film leaves a lasting impression on the audience - some say haunting - and creates conversation it fully succeeds as art and deserves any awards it receives.oo short to waste.

B000BFH2S2|5.0|This CD/DVD is my first experience is seeing any live performances from Michael Buble. It is so amazing. The CD is great and I love \\"Smile\\" but the star is definitely the DVD. The whole concert is amazing but I think it's his interactions with the audience that is the best parts of the show. I just love when he sings \\"Please excuse my attitude/Sorry if I'm being rude/But they said no flash photography\\". Very funny. But you can tell that he really loves and appreciates his fans because he lets them take pictures of him and he does a run into the audience. Another great moment is the moment with Josh Groban which then goes into a great performance of Maroon 5's \\"This love\\". The duet with Laura Pausini is lovely and I'm looking into getting a cd of hers because she has a really beautiful voice. The little behind the scenes footage is great and Michael's funny personality really shines through on it.<br /><br />So this CD and DVD are both utterly fantastic from start to finish. No Michael Buble fan collection would be complete without it.
B0000067L2|5.0|For the Na NaNa Na Na Na Na  poster:  SWLABR = She Walks Like a Bearded Rainbow.  The title was probably chosen by long-time Jack Bruce collaborator Peter \\"Rope Ladder to the Moon\\" Brown,  who wrote much of the lyric for Cream.  Exotic chemical substances were all the rage back in 1968 and it definitely shows here. It's all good, including Mother's Lament and Blue Condition.  This is a great CD, buy it.  'Nuff said.
B00000IL1K|4.0|For a while I had the tendency to avoid this pretentious small voiced singer, until I heard this album playing in a store one time. Sarah Brightman does have a lovely voice and it does go well with the songs chosen. <br />Highlighting my favorites: \\"In Paradisum\\" is a beautiful beginning to this album. \\"Eden\\" which is a simple but dramatic crossover. \\"So Many Things\\" has a haunting delicate quality that's attention catching and relaxing at the same time. \\"Anytime, Anywhere\\" is crossover mixing of dramatic classical parts and calm pop parts, blending with this album well. \\"Dust In the Wind\\" is one of the better versions of this song. \\"Deliver Me\\" is slower, dramatic and beautiful and describes what the title states. \\"Scene D'Amour\\" has the right amount of drama and is very haunting. <br />Drama is the main theme of this album which is nice at the same time can be annoying since all the songs are made to be dramatic, though I do love this album and would recommend it to first time Brightman listeners.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I know some people are harping on this album not being jazzy enough, or perhaps some pop tendencies to be surfacing. I think that is mostly bogus talk. The sounds are smooth, relaxing, never boring, just amazingly good music with clear and beautiful vocals. If you are on the fence, unless you are some weird old fuddy duddy or something, you will like this album a lot.
B000063DIR|1.0|Some have said that only Ozzy and Randy matter. Sure, Randy and Ozzy are the main guys, but, I am a long time fan of Lee Kerslake and Bob Daisley as i`m sure others are too. Anybody who really listens to the music and knows how it`s suppose to sound can hear the difference right away and would`nt want to listen to it that way. I bought \\"Dairy\\" 25 years ago when it was originally released and this B.S. just don`t cut it. The 2002 CD is listenable, but so what. When I buy a re-issue of a classic album I expect to get what was on the original recording, not a bunch other players screwing up the song. Anytime you have different musicians playing a song it changes the feel of the original, PERIOD! The CD cover gives no indication that there are different guys playing the bass and drum tracks, which pissed me off even more. It`s like they think we are stupid and would`nt know the difference. Some of us care who is on the recording. This on going war over royalties is just stupid. Ozzy and Sharon live like freaking royalty. One would think they can afford to pay people that they have employeed, especially when they were so important to the creation of a classic, timeless album like this. It makes me sad when people who were so rebellious and were wavemakers in their day get so tied up in money, greed and corporate politics. Nothing but money matters anymore and i don`t blame Daisley and Kerslake at all for suing the Osbournes. They deserve to get the roylties thats owed to them. Bunch of stupid, greedy nonsense that ruined two outstanding classic albums..............
0141439513|5.0|Written in the early XVIII Century, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's most popular and loved novel - but not really her best. One of the first works she wrote, the novel is sometimes a little undercooked compared to her most complex works, like \\"Emma\\" and \\"Persuasion\\", however, it is still a joy to read. In this book, she created her most famous romantic hero in Mr Darcy, an unforgettable stubborn who makes a perfect match to Lizzie Bennet. They were meant for each other.<br /><br />The only problem is that they haven't figured it our. On the other hand, any reader can realize it from the first moment the couple meet. In other words, we do know how the book ends, so why do so many people keep reading, and rereading this novel? One reason is that Austen has created some very believable characters - and also very endearing. That's because they are very human. Lizzie and Mr Darcy have very wrong first impressions of each other when they met and that's why it takes so long for accepting their mutual love.<br /><br />In this sense, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a story about overcoming our prides and our prejudices acquire in the first impression, and changing one's mind. Both Lizzie and Mr Darcy realize before the end of the story they were made for each other - but the problem is that their wrong impressions lead them to make choices that become barriers to their love. The path they will have to follow in order to find the fully accomplishment of their mutual feelings is the strongest plot in the novel.<br /><br />At the same time, the reader is fed with details about class and courtship from the time the book was written. In Jane Austen's work, her characters are sometimes like small figurines that represent the whole world - or at least England. And the writer does it with charm and style. Her books are a document of a time, tackling its fashions, moral and behavior.<br /><br />Peguin Classics is probably the best edition, since it has many notes and an extensive introduction, dealing not only with Austen's works in general, but also with an detailed essay on this book. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of those books that will be read forever, and should be read from people in different time of their lives. We find different approaches, and understanding as we grow older.roduction, dealing not only with Austen's works in general, but also with an detailed essay on this book. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of those books that will be read forever, and should be read from people in different time of their lives.

0895260131|2.0|I have reservations about this and any book that relies on the literal meaning of quotes taken from ancient religious texts.  While the Koran does make frequent references to war and war making, the first act of an author using religious texts is to address the possible symbolism in these words.   <br /> <br />The Old and New Testiment are chock full of symbolism, as are all the sacred books of the major religions.  They all attempt the difficult task of communicating the unexplainable or,  rather, knowledge which is virtually impossible to comprehend with the thinking mind.  Perceiving it often requires an emotional element which is best aroused through parables and symbols.  The authors of these texts knew full well that ordinary language would not do.  They resorted to symbols to get across their meaning.  The word \\"war\\" used frequently in the Koran, therefore, may symbolize a personal struggle against habits or temptations which prevent one from achieving the religious ideal, whatever that might be.   <br /> <br />This problem is well known by the estoteric branches of all the major religions.  In fact, at the esoteric level, there is little disagreement between Muslims, Christians, Jews, and followers of the great eastern religions.  Their teachings agree almost idea for idea with each other.  A key idea in all of them is that in reality there can be only one truth.  This suggests that, far from being at odds with one another, the great religious texts attempt to convey the same ideas, albeit in different languages using unique symbols and parables appropriate to the culture at hand.  The Suffis (the Islamic esoterics) say that when a person comes to understand the true meaning of one sacred text, he or she will understand all of them.    <br /> <br />A misunderstood religious text, however, is a force to deal with, and if the misunderstanding is widespead and is a fundamental cause of turmoil in today's world, we cannot ignor it.  So, in this sense, it is goodto read books like this one.  But, hopefully, readers will come away realizing that it isn't the essense of the religious ideas that are to blame, but the way in which its adherents interpret them.  Perhaps \\"war\\" as a symbol was a bad choice for Mohammed to make.  Well,  <br />afterall, he never claimed divinity.
B0000025BL|5.0|WOW! What an album. This album is fantastic and made Meat Loaf a living legend aswell as spawning some of the most memorable and recognised songs ever. It was 'Bat out of hell', 'You took the words right out of my mouth', and `Paradise by the dasboard light `and' Two out of three ain't bad' which made an unlikely superstar out of Meat Loaf.  <br />Every single song on this album is fantastic and it's been a while since I've actually heard an album that doesn't contain a single 'album filler'. This is why the album has lasted as long as it has. It's is one of the biggest selling albums of all time and has stayed it the UK charts for more than 474 weeks (That's over 9 years!). Bat out of hell was #36 in the US music charts in 1990 thirteen years after its release! And has sold over 35 million copies worldwide and is still selling today.  <br /> <br />Meat Loaf is known as the Pavarotti of rock and this album really shows off his operatic, bombastic, over the top and theatrical style of music. This album is vital to anyone's music collection and if you haven't got a copy yet, it is well worth getting. I'm a huge Meat Loaf fan but I do not lie when I come to reviewing his music. Personally I think this album is an absolute masterpiece and is the proof that Meat Loaf is still, larger than life... and always will be.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000784WMW|3.0|I kept losing interest in this version mainly due to Clarke's portrayal of Jane...way too unemotional and bland.  Dalton was very good as Rochester, a little too handsome though.  Yes, this version is very true to the book but due to Clarke's performance, I felt there was absolutely no chemistry or passion between the main characters which is very important to the story.  Also, the interior shots - the direction, camera work and editing seemed clumsy and were definitely lacking in quality.

B00005JOFO|5.0|Finally, we went to see the movie Brokeback Mountain this Sunday. This movie is about the love affair between two cow boys Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist in 1963. After seeing this movie and I couldn't calm down my sorrow for awhile. We are kind of being spoiled of living in 2006 today, but I know some people who are still living in a closet like Ennis and Jack in the movie.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />After the movie, I have few questions to ask you:  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />1)     How can you tell your husband is not gay? Or you are fooling your 100% straight husband right now on a same boat (lesbian)? <br /> <br />2)     If you are a gay straight man (living in a closet with a family), would you continue to blind yourself and the others? But Why (Remind you that life is short!) <br /> <br />3)     If gay is wrong and have to be suppressed, then how about love? Is love wrong and it has to be suppressed too? Who can approve two human beings can love or not love each other. Society, religious, government or ....If gay is a choice, do you choose to be straight? I think we all just have to listen to the heart carefully. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />At the end of the movie, I had a song came out in my head and it matched the ending of the movie very much. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Here I am playing with those memories again  <br />And just when I thought time had set me free  <br />Those thoughts of you keep taunting me  <br /> <br />Holding you, a feeling I never outgrew  <br />Though each and every part of me has tried  <br />Only you can fill that space inside  <br /> <br />So there's no sense pretending  <br />My heart it's not mending  <br /> <br />Chorus:  <br />Just when I thought I was over you  <br />Just when I thought I could stand on my own  <br />Oh baby those memories come crashing through  <br />And I just can't go on without you  <br /> <br />On my own I've tried to make the best of it alone  <br />I've done everything I can to ease the pain  <br />But only you can stop the rain  <br /> <br />I just can't live without you  <br />I miss everything about you  <br /> <br />Chorus  <br /> <br />It's just no good without you  <br />Without you, without you, without you <br /> <br />Air Supply / Here I am  <br /> <br />

Not only does the incredibly rich sound just jump out of the speakers but the sheer power of the songs played back-to-back is quite stunning. That's what it was like when you originally bought the LP, and that's how it should be heard to remember why it's one of rock's \\"classic\\" albums. Best of all you can use the wonders of modern technology to skip over its two fairly serious aberrations, \\"Blue Condition\\" & \\"Mothers Lament\\", to end up with a superb set of genuinely progressive \\"psychedelia meets the blues\\" that, on the way, features some quite breathtaking interactions between three world class musicians.
0321344758|5.0|Its amazing that this little book (under 200), can be so useful. The book discusses in very easy to read, non-technical terms what makes a good web design focusing on not how to create web pages but how users will view and use your site based upon specific criteria.     The first chapter begins by giving a overiew of a high-level explanation of what users actually respond to in web layout and design. For instance, placement of text, type of buttons, graphical display, useage of drop-downs and navigation, etc.    The next few chapters gives alot of detail in how users actually view a web page. From how people read web pages (actually scan them), to how designers and user see web pages, to the reasoning behind user choies.    The middle part of the book focuses on describing what parts of a web page should like to get the desired results from visitors. The author gives great examples of page navigation techniques and what works and what doesn't. The authors description of navuigations techniques of professional desgined sites (Amazon, Gap, MSNBC, About.com) really make it believeable that his suggestions will work with your website too!    The end of the book reviews the importance of usability testing and why overlooking this last aspect of web development can decide whether your site is sucessful or not.    A great book, with lots of great information. A must buy!
B00005JOFO|5.0|Last Friday night, I mean, early Saturday morning, February 4, around 2. a.m., very anxious about work, I finally started watching the movie \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", but I fell asleep after the very first half hour.  I had found the first \\"intimate\\" sex very much physical (even rough), I mean, not an expression or result of emotional and affective connection or mutual dependence  - and so I lost interest.      2. Still when I finished watching the movie the day after, I thought: \\"Oscar-deserving!\\"    3. It is a very sad - it can be a rather depressing - movie, because it is an adult and mature story. A movie for mature and grown-up people - and I don't know if I can be included among them yet in spite of all my age.     4.The two cowboys got aware of the intensity of love \\"after\\", in the course of their lives, \\"little by little\\"(!), but the love and passion had been there - an absolutely passionate connection indeed - all the time from the very beginning.      5. By the way, there are two \\"iceberg melting\\" scenes: their meeting and hugging after years apart and when one is punching the other almost in despair (\\"where am I going without you?\\").     6. They did not try to runaway, to fantasize or \\"to hide between girl's legs\\": they simply had no option in the beginning due to their cultural background, inexperience and immaturiy; they had not the means of giving full expression to the best thing that happened in their lives - their mutual love.      7. Anyway I must recognise I was very sad after I had seen the movie and spent the rest of the day very depressed.  I had to take Lorax twice.  I don't know when I will see it again yet.     8. Heart-breaking particularly in the ending: after the murder, the memories still in the closet and the sky (Heaven) perspective from the window.     9. And still I think that, in spite of all, they were enviable because highly, very highly, blessed.     10. Great actors (both, and Heath Ledger is ready: superb), great actresses (both wives; the pain, confusion and respect in the first one's eyes is something to notice) , great shots, great movie - who said life is easy?  Eight fair nomminations indeed.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity stands alone as an amazing film. Coupled with Firefly, it is even better. This movie has a heart, which is what nearly all science fiction films lack nowadays (faux-subtle nod to Star Wars 1,2 &3). The characters are honest, true, and human. The threats are real, the danger is intense, and nobody is safe. I felt connections to every character within minutes of the movie beginning. I have seen it 6 times and each time I am on the edge of my seat, wringing my hands in anticipation. This is a fantastic movie, and while I does not need to be watched in conjunction with Firefly, it is even better after doing so.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|This is a 3.5 star B-movie.  To claim it's more than that is to over-rate the production values.  The story is recycled, its vision is narrow and simplistic, the actors shift into and out of their accents from scene to scene, the special effects are TV-movie quality, and the imagery is out of context (spaceships emerging from an \\"ion cloud\\" in space as if they were Lord Nelson's fleet emerging from a fog bank?  Please.)  So why 3.5 stars?  Star Wars (at least the last 3 installments) had much better special effects, a grander vision, and attempted an epic scope, but failed for the same reasons that this movie succeeds.  Star Wars was pompous and tedious, this movie is fun.  The characters are multi-dimensional (if also anachronistic -- if that's not a non sequitor, given the context), and the actors (forget the bad accents) actually try to inhabit their characters instead of mailing in their performances.  And they have imaginative dialog to work with.  Note to George Lucas: next time, skimp on a few of the droid effects so that you can pay an actual screenwriter.  The look River gives Simon when he asks, \\"am I talking to Miranda now?\\" is better than anything in the last three Star Wars installments.  And if the story is recycled, what story isn't these days?  All in all, a keeper.
B000002UAR|5.0|How lucky I was to have heard this album, fresh, right out of the bin the very week it was released, though still engrossed with Rubber Soul - both my faves of all time. Revolver is still as fresh as your first bite of a Granny Smith apple and continues to taste good as a piece of the whole pie! The Phenomenal Fab are unparalleled and Revolver is the best of that period, not to diminish any of their earlier art, also masterworks. It remains the forerunner of anything relating to Rock we hear today. If the demanding and tiring world we live in now were only as pleasurable and as simplified as 1966, perhaps we could be exactly enthralled as when Revolver first came into our realization. Still, it takes me back...so, as John so aptly advised \\"Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream\\" and for those who are appreciating Revolver for their first time - take pleasure in the dream!
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|Video games have been entertaining kids, teenagers, and adults consistently for about the last 25 years.  From Pong to Madden, Pac-Man to Tomb Raider, there is not a single doubt in anyone's mind that though most games have been created for entertainment purposes only, and that the graphics have significantly improved through every generation of gaming.  There are some games that standout from the rest in terms of almost movie quality experience within the game, from intense stories, stunningly realistic graphics, and for the most part solid voice acting, many of today's video game franchises have felt like they are movies that players have full control over.  Such franchises are extremely successful, some examples would be; `Silent Hill 1-4', all of the `Tomb Raider' games, and the controversial `Grand Theft Auto' franchise.  One of the most popular video games with that cinematic quality would have to be the `Resident Evil' series.  With its eerie and creepy storyline and music, dark and dangerous environments that are loaded with evil zombies waiting to kill you, and the great voice-over actors used to bring your favorite characters to life, it is clear why this franchise is one of the strongest franchises to this day, even after having 3 sequels and a prequel game released in the series.  Many of these video game franchises have been so successful that even Hollywood has begun to take notice, recent Hollywood movies based on video game franchises have been pretty much hit-and-miss in terms of loyalty to the source material and interest from the general movie-going public.  The failures would have to be \\"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\\", \\"Alone In the Dark\\", \\"Mortal Kombat\\", and \\"Bloodrayne\\", the successes have basically been between two franchises the `Tomb Raider' franchise starring Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft in \\"Tomb Raider\\" and \\"Tomb Raider:  The Cradle of Life\\", and the Milla Jovovich thrillers \\"Resident Evil\\" and \\"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse\\".  It just so happens that this review is for \\"Resident Evil\\", look for future reviews to feature my opinions on both the good and bad adaptations. <br /> <br />\\"Resident Evil\\" begins with a paramilitary commando team invading a house that appears to be mostly vacant except for a strange woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich).  Upon further searching of the grounds, it appears that all is not as it seems, and that this house is really a cover for a secret underground facility set up by the evil Umbrella Corporation.  Though Alice doesn't recall what has happened in the recent days, except for the bits and pieces she receives via flashbacks, she quickly begins to understand that there is definitely something awry with this facility.  A fact that is proven to be correct by the existence of zombies that have begun hunting the paramilitary team.  As if the zombies weren't enough to contend with, it seems that the facility's defense mechanism has been activated and the facility itself is hunting the commandos.  Now, all are in a race for their lives to escape the facility without letting any of the zombies make it to the surface. <br /> <br />Writer/Director Paul W. S. Anderson really had his work cut out for him when releasing this movie.  With previous video game adaptations failing at the box office, many movie-goers and critics were highly skeptical that any video game franchise could translate well onto the big screen.  Understanding that his biggest asset would be to not assume that everyone knows the source material, i.e. the video game, Anderson crafted a story that stays true to the video games, even feels like it could have come from any of the video game installments, yet also stands on it's own as a separate creation.  The actors are all very talented, and all give solid, realistic performances that serve to raise the movie up from being a simple video game adaptation and/or zombie movie into a truly suspenseful thrill-ride that doesn't require any knowledge of the source material so that all movie audiences can walk right into the theater and be on the same page in terms of what's occuring in the movie.  The special effects work for the most part is very well done, a few scenes are a little weak, but I understand that the studio might not want to risk breaking the bank on a video game franchise that isn't a guaranteed success at the box office.   <br /> <br />Though I enjoyed \\"Resident Evil\\", I must admit that upon my first viewing of the movie I wasn't as enthralled by it.  This has mostly to do with the fact that there is a wide open ending to the movie, there is some resolution, but for the most part the story is left open and screaming for a sequel.  Since I saw the movie within a few weeks of its arrival on DVD, there had not been any announcement made regarding a future sequel.  Without a sequel the story is incomplete, and therefore a let down.  However a year later Columbia Pictures announced that they had begun production on \\"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse\\" and that the basic story written again by Paul W. S. Anderson, would pick up directly where \\"Resident Evil\\" left off.  Needless to say, this made me happy and so when the sequel came out on DVD I rented both movies and watched them back to back.  By doing this I was treated to a complete story that is truly too big to fit into one movie and the need for two movies to tell one story made sense, and I was no longer frustrated with the first film.  With all that being said, if you are wanting to watch \\"Resident Evil\\", please keep in mind that you need to rent the sequel at the same time or shortly after viewing the first film so that you will get the complete movie experience as it was intended to be. <br /> <br />\\"Resident Evil\\" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.
B0009W5JS2|1.0|Darius Stone, played by Ice Cube (Barbershop, Three Kings) is the new XXX and of course who is the guy who brings him in? Gibbons, played by none other then Samuel L. Jackson (Freedomland, Pulp Fiction). Stone breaks out of prison and what not and some FBI guy Kyle Steele, played by Scott Speedman (My Life Without Me, Dark Blue) is hot on his trail. They find out that Secretary of State Deckert, played by of course, Willem Dafoe (The Clearing, The Reckoning) is making his move on the president. This is his plan....he wants to kill the president and some other figures of office so that he can become the new president...sad, sad premise and an even sad, sad ending...I'm not saying tear jerker said where you blow your nose into a tissue, I'm talking about sad, lame, pathetic sad. Unless they actually killed off Ice \\"Doughboy\\" Cube, I would of used a tissue but they didnt so I didnt. The CGI in this is horrid especially with the end when Ice Cube is riding on the train tracks (come on) and whole thing with Scott Speedman repelling down from the helicopter, I could of done a much better frickin' ending without the train, helicopter or the fancy car. Also starring Xzibit (Pimp My Ride, Derailed) and Peter Strauss (he's like Sam Shepard's twin brother I swear to god) and a cameo by Todd Louiso (High Fidelity, 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag). Vin Diesel said that he wouldnt do sequels to his movies but he did Chronicles of Riddick which was a little better then this but that was dreadful also....I guess that's why he did  <br />The Pacifier. In Conclusion....oh who cares...lame movie is all I have to say.
0743454537|3.0|If there are two things I hate in a novel they are :1: having a love story added to a book when it in not needed and detracts from the otherwise interesting plot and 2: adding a twist to the end of a story that deflates the emotional intensity that has built up, making the book unrealistic. This book has both. Other than that it is well written and a real page turner ,but, be prepared to suspend disbelief through out.
0307276902|4.0|The book gives a vivid description of the life of an addict.  It mostly concerns that life inside a clinic without means of satisfying the addiction whether it is alcohol or drugs.  One is able to somewhat comprehend the loneliness, despair and hopelessness felt by the individual.  In the main that individual is the book's author.  The lives of other addicts within the clinic are also opened to review as well as the author's interactions with them.  In particular his relationship with a female inmate results in a romantic involvement not condoned by the institution.   <br /> <br />It is difficult to understand his extreme anger toward his parents coupled with a degree of compassion for them.  Some understanding does come from revelations of his early childhood after the parents come to the clinic to work in conjunction with the clinic staff and the author in an attempt to aid in his recovery. <br /> <br />It was also difficult to understand his firm refusal to seek help from religion or from an organization like Alcoholics Anonymous.  He said this was just trading one addiction for another and apparently was not able to see the contrast of lives lived under the latter \\"addiction\\" with that under the former addiction <br /> <br />To me one of the downsides to the book was repetition.  The author in revealing his state of mind often repeated many of his thoughts.  Also, one obscene word appeared at least once in one form or another on almost every page.   <br /> <br />I would recommend the book as I found it both interesting and informative <br />
0395389496|5.0|\\"The Polar Express\\", a book based on fiction, was written by Chris Van Allsburg.  Van Allsburg grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where as a boy he could enjoy the open fields and have near by places to catch tadpoles.  He attended college at the University of Michigan, majoring in fine arts and went on to receive an advanced degree in Sculpture from the Rhode Island School of Design.  He won two Caldecott Medals, one being for the \\"The Polar Express\\".  Van Allsurg has also achieved status as one of the greatest children's book illustrators of our time.<br /><br />The idea for \\"The Polar Express\\" began with a train in the woods and Van Allsburg wondered where it would go if a boy got on.  The idea for the story blossomed into the beloved book it is today.  The book opens as a young boy waits patiently to hear the bells of Santa's sleigh, \\"a sound a friend had told him he would never hear\\".  Instead, he hears the hissing sound of a train and goes out to investigate.  The conductor calls all aboard and the boy climbs on. The train is filled with other children eating sweets and drinking hot chocolate.  He learns that the train is headed for the North Pole and the children are going to see Santa give his first gift for Christmas.  The young boy is picked and receives a small bell for his prize, which you must believe in to hear it.  This is a wonderful book, encouraging one to believe and it will come true.  The boy recalls, \\"Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe\\".
B00008976Y|5.0|I've always been puzzled by reviews that call Bleu difficult or enigmatic.  It is a straightforward, often wrenchingly sad, but finally triumphant story of a woman who comes back to emotional life after the sudden deaths of her husband and young daughter.  And she comes back to life by spreading her goodness and generosity (as one character describes it) among those who break through her isolation.  The movie is lushly photographed and, as you would expect from the title, blues are in almost every scene, sometimes flooding the screen as when Juliette Binoche is swimming in an indoor pool, sometimes just in a small prop or piece of clothing.  Binoche is outstanding and the rest of the cast supports her ably.  Except for that triumphant crowning moment in Red where Kieslowski, recalling E.M. Forster's dictum, brings together for a brief time his three movies, Blue is the trilogy's finest achievement.
B0000CNY27|5.0|After 25 years, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is the ultimate John Carpenter classic and with this special edition DVD, Kurt Russell took the character Snake Plissken and brought him to another level, he the outlaw that everyone is afraid to be and this was before the John Rambo films were released. On the special features you get the imfamous deleted alternate beginning of the movie that Kurt Russell has no memory of even if he took a polygraph test. I remember seeing it for the first time in 1981, and everytime I see it, it just gets better and better. Highly recommended for those who aren't John Carpenter fans, to this day, it still remains as the best cult sci-fi action films.
6305882592|4.0|In this 1971 film, a feisty, rebellious, car-stealing woman on the verge of 80 befriends a bored, rich young man obsessed with death.  Linked by their hobby of attending funerals, they teach other about the beauty and love available in life.  A great musical score by Cat Stevens accompanies the action.  A strange and surprising cult film, still moving over 30 years after its production.
1582403589|3.0|In his introduction to this first collection of \\"The Walking Dead\\" series, writer Kirkman explains that rather than a simple gorefest, his goal was to create a character-based storyline which realistically shows what one person might face when civilization collapses. While he has certainly done that, he hasn't brought anything particularly new to the table. There are plenty of captivating stories about how human nature works under such stress, from William Golding's classic \\"Lord of the Flies\\", to Thomas Disch's science-fiction \\"The Genocides\\", to Portuguese Nobel laureate Jose Saramago's brilliant \\"Blindness\\". In this initial six-book collection, Kirkman shows us nothing we haven't seen before, either in film or literature.<br /><br />The story starts, as many have pointed out, with a situation almost identical to the excellent British film 28 Days Later, with the protagonist waking from a coma in a hospital and then stumbling out to discover what's happened to the world. However, before everyone runs around yelling \\"rip-off\\" (oops, too late for that) it needs to be pointed out that this series was pitched to Image in 2002 and was ready to be launched in Spring 2003, but was bumped to a Fall release. Meanwhile, 28 Days Later hit wide release in the US in June 2003 , and Kirkman has said in many interviews that while he was shocked to see the same opening hook, he never considered going back to rescript the opening. In any event, it's not a big deal, but hopefully that dispels any notion of plagiarism.<br /><br />So, after waking from his coma, Kentucky small-town cop Rick must try and figure out what happened while he was recovering from a gunshot wound, and where any other survivors are. There are the standard scenes one might expect: he visits home, gathers supplies, and makes a plan to head to Atlanta to look for his wife and son. His journey slowly acclimates him to the horror of the situation, but nothing can prepare him for the literal army of the dead he finds in Atlanta. Fortunately, he hooks up with a tiny band of 10-15 survivors outside of the city. The rest of the book is about the group's attempt to band together in the face of adversity and form some kind of new community. Kirkman does a fairly good job of this, although people seem a good deal less traumatized by the situation than one might expect. The only character I totally bought was the mechanic who was practically catatonic after seeing his whole family ripped apart in front of him.<br /><br />As in all such end-of-the-world stories, a new pecking order among the humans starts to emerge, leading to tension and conflict. One of the catalysts for this is the question of whether or not the group should stay where they are. This debate is a little strange, in that it's only really held by two characters, and their camp is totally indefensible. This is where the book gets a little unrealistic -- the characters seem a good deal too carefree to the danger all around them, and naturally, there are several zombie incidents as a result. Still, a sequence where the hero takes a dangerous run into town to get some guns, and the subsequent training of everyone with guns is nicely done. Especially when the hero and his wife argue about whether or not their kid should carry a gun. This six-book arc ends with an excellent climax, and made me a little more interested in picking up volume two.<br /><br />The artwork tends to be a little too flat and simple for my taste, with fairly even shading. However whenever there are zombies to be shown, these are given plenty of attention and detail, creating a kind of discrepancy in styles that I found a little awkward. One reviewer wrote that it resembles movie storyboard art, and I tend to agree. On the whole, the book was fine, just not that original -- but I'll be back to check out more.finds in Atlanta.

B000002MG1|4.0|I honestly think every REM album through \\"Hi-Fi\\" is really good, but I admit there's something extra special about \\"Automatic For The People\\". It's one of those albums where everything came together, and there's an above-average amount of quality tracks. So it seems the major-label debut \\"Green\\", and the major-success of \\"Out Of Time\\" were simply leading up to this. The big hits here were indeed big, as \\"Man On The Moon\\" was called the ultimate REM song by Peter Buck, and \\"Everybody Hurts\\" has probably saved more lives than FEMA. However, it's the lesser-knowns that really make this the album it is. \\"Drive\\" was a minor hit, but I like it more than the other two. \\"Sweetness Follows\\" is sweet, \\"Star Me Kitten\\" is almost hypnotic, and \\"Find The River\\" is one of my favorites off any album. Not every track is 5-star, but I think I can safely call this their best album of the 90's.
0446677450|1.0|First off, if you are a novice at handling your finances, investments or career, and are thinking to read this book to improve your knowledge and understanding, there are quite a few books out there that would be better suited for almost all of you. <br /> <br />If you want a book that has tried and true advice with advice that has been valid for thousands of years, start with \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\" (1926).  It's underlying messages about finances and life were true thousands of years ago, were true in 1926, and are true now. <br /> <br />If you're insistant on reading something more current, \\"The Millionare Next Door\\" should fill the same needs. <br /> <br />If you were thinking of picking up this book because you've already decided to save money, but now you want to figure out how to take that money and \\"make it work for you\\" (paraphrasing Kiyosaki), a book that will give you a great introduction to the stock market and investing in general, which I highly suggest, is \\"The Little Book That Beats the Market\\". <br /> <br />In addition to having more detailed advice, which is lacking in \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\", you won't have to worry about lies or contradictory statements in those books. <br /> <br />As someone else has already done their research on Kiyosaki better than I could, I will simply link to his analysis of \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" here: <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />If you still want to consider buying this piece of fiction, please do yourself the favor of making sure you've read John T. Reed's analysis first.  Contrary to what Kiyosaki might tell you, education is a good thing...
B0009S3HI0|5.0|I notice that many reviewers have expressed disappointment with this collection, commenting that it was less than they expected.  For me, it's the opposite: this CD was much, much MORE than I expected.  This disc is quite an achievement, as the 'Tones draw from various genres and influences--many of them unexpected--creating a collection that literally offers something for almost everyone.  The DVD is perfect, as others have noted already.  For me the highlight is \\"Minerva\\" with its middle-of-nowhere desert setting. <br /> <br />Let's get to the CD review: <br /> <br />Best Songs <br />-\\"Simple Man\\" (Skynyrd Cover)  One of my all-time favorites, and I'd have never expected to hear the Deftones cover it.  They stay true to the original and the solo is scorching. <br />-\\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\" (Cure Cover)  The liner notes describe how the 'Tones were hesitant to play this live with the Cure in attendance.  They had nothing to worry about. <br />-\\"Savory\\" (Jawbox Cover)  Interesting to hear someone besides Chino sing lead on a Deftones song.  This is a jam session with members of Far (another Sacto band).  A great opener for the album. <br />-\\"Please Please Please (Let Me Get What I Want)\\" (Smiths Cover): I have to admit I've never heard the original, but this is great stuff...reminds me of \\"Boys Republic\\" from White Pony. <br />-\\"The Chauffeur\\" (Duran Duran Cover):  Way better than the original. <br />-Acoustic Versions of \\"Change, Be Quiet and Drive\\", and \\"Digital Bath\\".  I bought the \\"Music In High Places-Deftones in Hawaii\\" video just to hear acoustic versions of Deftones songs.  All 3 of these are gems. <br />-\\"Black Moon\\": I don't like Rap.  I love \\"Black Moon\\", though. <br /> <br />All of the other tracks are worthwhile.  The covers of Cocteau Twins and Sade, \\"Wax and Wane\\" and \\"No Ordinary Love\\", are extremely well done, just not what I buy a Deftones CD to hear. <br /> <br />Really, the only two tracks I don't LOVE are \\"Crenshaw Punch\\" and \\"Sinatra\\"...these are the hardest tracks on the disc, but they both seem to lack focus/direction.  I've never really liked Helmet, anyway, so that probably explains it. <br /> <br />I love this disc.  The Deftones blew me away with their versatility on this collection.  This will help fill the void until Tool's new album comes out this spring.  And shortly after that, hopefully there will be a new Deftones CD in the offing. <br />
0312995423|2.0|If you are looking for a GOOD sotry about computer technologies that doesn't fall off a cliff, then \\"Digital Fortress\\" is not what you want to read. <br /> <br />This book is a major let-down.  Good beginning that just deteriorates into garbage. <br /> <br />I did, however, just finish a GREAT book that is a true New Age Cyber-Terror Tale.  Much more enjoyable, I suggest checking out \\"The Minerva Virus\\"  before you waste your time with this one.

0307276902|1.0|James Frey is the Milli Vanilli of American literature, a fraud so shameless he makes Jayson Blair look like a saint.  Oprah's crisis management team must be working overtime to distance themselves from this book.  But I don't have any sympathy for Oprah, either.  If she was smart and did her homework, this fiasco would have never happened.
B000BZ99WY|4.0|This review refers to the paperback edition by Arrow Books. An excellent book. It was different to what I expected - I thought it would contain detailed and elaborative descriptions of the acts of genocide in Rwanda. However, it was written at strategic level and Dallaire discusses the political and organisational hurdles and obstructions to the mission of the UN military contingent. For someone who knows little about the functioning of the UN, it provides lots of insight and information, without becoming technically boring.  <br /> <br />Obviously there are references to and descriptions of genocide acts. Such references are, however, professionally described and although the horribleness and sadness of those events are easy discernable, they remain within context with the rest of the book, supporting Dallaire's arguments without changing the book into an emotional experience. <br /> <br />Dallaire is extremely honest and although he assigned responsibility and accountability in well-argued motivations, he does not spare himself. In this reviewer's opinion, he is perhaps too critical of himself. But then, he is clearly a professional soldier (the photograph of him on the cover of the book is sufficient proof of that!), expecting total commitment and therefore prepared to commit himself totally. Not only does the book provide an overview of the military perspective but it also covers the political perspective extensively, probably because Dallaire, unexpectedly, had to fulfil that role as well for most of his term in Rwanda. <br /> <br />The book is well written and the editing is good. The glossary is extremely helpful to clarify acronyms and to identify role players. The index is also a welcome addition as are the maps at the start of the book. My only criticism is that the book contains no photographs - it would have been nice to see some of the faces behind the names. A nice touch, though, is a list of recommended reading at the back of the book. I strongly recommend this book for readers interested in African, political and/or military affairs. If I were a lecturer I would have prescribed the book to political science students or at least created an assignment for such students to critique the book, because of the insight it provides in international politics.  <br />
B00008NG5V|5.0|This is a fantastic album. It is more polished and refined than his first album, and therein lies the rub. Whereas Brushfire Fairytales sounded as if Johnson was coming to terms with music and more serious issues, On And On is more of a easygoing, relaxing album. It is well suited to driving. On the North Shore. With surfboards in the back. And with Pipe 8ft on the sets. The highlights are plenty with songs like Times Like These, Gone, Cupid, Holes To Heaven, Dreams Be Dreams, Fall Line, Cookie Jar, Rodeo Clowns, Cocoon and Symbol In My Driveway all scoring for Johnson. The songs to put on high rotation are The Horizon Has Been Defeated, Taylor and Mediocre Bad Guys, while the songs to be handed down for generations include Traffic In The Sky and Tomorrow Morning
068484267X|5.0|The story is heartbreaking but very beautifully written. It is probably the best book I have ever read. Everyone should read it!
0307276902|3.0|I'm tired of the controversy about how much of this book is true. It's been beaten beyond death. I was reading this book when Frey was on Oprah the second time, when he admitted that much of this book is fabricated. Much of the plot was revealed, so there weren't many surprises for me. And although I tried to read the book for the writing and ignore the controversy, I have to admit it was very hard. In truth, knowing that this wasn't a true story did detract from my reading experience. But aside from that, the book is decent. The writing style is interesting, if not ground-breaking. The story itself is graphic and reminded me of a Palahniuk novel with its sensitive tough-guy narrator always on the edge of punching someone or crying or pitching a fit. While I admire the author for overcoming his addiction, I can't say he's sympathetic, or even likable, as a narrator. There are times when Pieces hits hard, but there is also a fair amount of tedium in between. This might be because Frey was trying to capture everything that happened in rehab, from the dramatic to the commonplace. But since he, as we all know, took liberties with the facts, he might have taken the liberty of cutting a hundred pages and at least given us a tight, if not completely true, story.

She spent half an hour with him and then got put in a cab to McLean Hospital where she checked her self in and wouldn't leave for another two years. This book tells about the tow years she spent there and the people who were there with her. The books start with her getting to the hospital and then it tells you a little about the types of people that are there and why they are there. After that it tells about some of the things she saw and some things that happened to her. During the book she watches as one of her friends comes back once a week form shock therapy. She also watches hoe one of her friends Lisa tries to run away and then watches her be dragged back in. It shows you what mental hospital is like what the people are like what a normal day is for them. Her live goes up and down in the hospital some days she is happy watching the outside world go by while she is stuck in the hospital and some day she hates being there. Susanna is in there because she took 50 aspirin. I would say this book was okay. I didn't really like it but it was better then some other books I had read. I would say it's not the feel good book of the year. It is sad and makes you wonder how but some ones live is if they want to kill them self's. In the book she tells you about how she kept thinking about killing her self, but then she thinks that she was trying to kill the tho0ught of killing her self. The book was okay if you like more of a book that is something you wouldn't experience for your self then this would be the book for you. If you like more of a book that makes you feels good then I wouldn't read this book.
0425166805|5.0|<br />Go ahead and say what you will about this book and its author.  Some call it a fraud.  Some call it entertainment.  Some call it a theory. <br /> <br />I tend to lean towards calling it a Hypothesis.  (for those that know anything about a science, a hypothesis comes BEFORE the theory and isn't entirely factual).   <br /> <br />Many of DARWIN'S original claims toward Evolution have been proven incorrect.  Many considered him a lunatic, a heratic, and a fraud back in his day.  Yet he's now founder of quite a keystone in science today.  Dawinism BEGAN as a \\"Pseudo Science\\", much like how this book began. <br /> <br />However, it is my belief that Darwin actually did more research and hard work before publishing HIS ideas because he published a theory rather than a hypothesis, but again, the ideas in this book are too interesting to just throw away. <br /> <br />This AUTHOR'S assumptions as to why a particular artifact may support his theories may have been proven incorrect, but careful study should be considered as to HOW that same artifact may still relate to the same hypothesis which is: \\"Visitors/Aliens influencing our early culture, progression, religion, and artforms.\\"... I say this because it's worth seeing if we can make it into a full blown theory. <br /> <br />I don't agree with this author much, but his ideas bring your mind into questioning.  This book has the same effect on people much like Darwin did when he published his books. <br /> <br />Chariot of the Gods -- The Darwinism of our time.  People shoult put more consideration in the hypothesis rather than puting stock into his claims as if they're an actual theory. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm just a softie and being to kind to this man and his claims.  Maybe I'm completely wrong.  Feel free to disagree, but I still say this is one hell of a hypothesis.
0679735259|5.0|My hat's off to anyone who can sum up this book in a customer review. It is beyond anything I've ever read in its portrayal of men at war as witnessed by the war correspondents who accompany them on the front lines. Unlike the embedded journalists of our own time, the writers and photographers who covered Vietnam were much closer to being free agents, restricted only by their ingenuity and fearlessness to seek out the action that would represent the essence of America's military presence in southeast Asia (\\"There it is . . .), while the evidence everywhere was of an irrationality raised to such a pitch that it had become something driven only bit itself.<br /><br />Unable to remain objective or even conceive of objectivity, Herr and his colleagues yield to a kind of hallucinatory experience, depicting the war as a phantasmagoria, a really bad trip that also seduced them with what one of them insists is a compelling glamour. To read this book is to experience Vietnam not as a historical record or analysis, or even a personal memoir, but as a kind of hypnotic nightmare from which many, including survivors, never wake.
0143036556|5.0|This is full of very good facts and history on how societies fail.  It's a primer for \\"likely\\" earth collapse/failure.  It's a globalization and ecology \\"textbook\\". I think it's better than his Pulitzer Prize, earlier and somewhat related book.  Read it and worry!  But don't forget to think it all through carefully! I don't think it is \\"light reading\\".  (It's the beginings of my favorite topic \\"Good Science, Clean Tech.\\")
B00008NRI7|3.0|Fans of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant are probably more enamored of this movie than I am, but if you like lightweight comedies and romantic conflicts, then TWO WEEKS NOTICE isn't all that bad.  Reminiscent of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson comedies of the sixties, this movie brings us Bullock as a legal aid lawyer who has been raised to stand up for causes she believes in, even if it means getting arrested in doing so.  Her latest foe is a corporation run by none other than Mr. Grant, who plans on tearing down the beloved community center on Coney Island.  Grant strikes up a deal that he'll spare the building if she comes to work for him.  Despite the protests of her parents, including Robert Klein as her feisty dad, she accepts and finds herself helping Grant pick out his clothes, ties, colognes and other personal duties.  After a while, she decides to give her two weeks notice and trains her replacement, a wispy young redhead named June Carver (Alicia Witt), who makes a play for the handsome womanizer.  From there, it's just a matter of time till the ill-matched pair realize they'e in love and one can certainly guess where the movie ends up.<br /><br />Bullock and Grant are in good form, with Grant getting all the good lines, and the film uses contemporary pop songs effectively, letting the music mirror the particular scene.  If you like this kind of lightweight comedy, you'll probably like TWO WEEKS NOTICE.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|A.S's first two albums were brilliant, harcore metal compilations of powerful riffs and screamo vocals. Howeevr after hearing this i've gathered that they've gone for a more 'punk' style, which sadly isn't for me. :(
0345479092|5.0|The only sane book I could find on how to care for your baby day to day.  Trouble shooting for problems is addressed, but most books for baby care are talking about physical development or fixing problems.  This book instructs onhow to raise and care for your baby.  A wonderful book for new parents, a great review for seasoned parents.  An excellent baby shower gift.
B000AWYOGE|1.0|After hearing all the hype ,I immediately wanted to see it,but what the hell was I thinking?I guess it takes the right kind of audience to appreciate something like this.The movie just drags on and on,and all for nothing.It isn't scary in the least and a complete waste of time and money.What little suspense is in the movie leads to nothing.If you like junk like this go see \\"The Village.\\"
B000301YY8|5.0|Although the album is not exactly the most uplifting album, its good for soul searching.  The piano provides a purity not often found in music today.  The songs touch the heartstrings, and you'll find yourself contemplating your own life while listening to the album.  However, just don't expect yourself to be anything but pensive after listening.
6305897786|5.0|Wow!This movie redefines the term \\"darkness\\".Johnny Depp is a damn good actor,and this is one of his finest works.This one's full of non stop mystery and suspense,and I recommend it to any true lover of the supernatural/suspense/mystery genre.I have learned that the second part called \\"The Devil's Beauty\\"will be released later this year.
0273617109|4.0|It is VERY slow going, but you *do* get the impression that this is an important skill to have. The tips are good, and the examples are easy to comprehend. I dont think they should wait until you're in business to learn this. They should teach the Principle in highschool!... if you could stay awake long enough to learn it.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|Buy the full DVD set!  You won't regret it!  I really bought this just to watch the Pink Floyd set again.  But, I got a lot more than I thought I would get.  I fell in love again with some old favorites and discovered some new acts.  The down side to this DVD is that it has cost me lots of money.  I went out and bought several CDs from many of the bands.   <br /> <br />If you have a good entertainment system, this is a must buy!  The remastering is incredible.  I've watched the whole thing many, many times.  If you own just one concert DVD, this is the one you should add to your library.  My favorite highlights are: Robbie Williams, Pink Floyd, Pet Shop Boys, Cold Play.
0142000663|3.0|The Grapes of Wrath is a book set during the Depression and the Dust Bowl.  It tells the story of one family, the Joads, but shows the roughness and impact this time had on all people.  The family leaves their farm in Oklahoma and travels to California to find work.  Half of the characters die or desert the family by the end of the novel.<br /><br />I felt that the book was genius when it came to themes and exploring human characteristics, but the actual book length was much longer than needed to put the points across.  Steinbeck has a wonderful ability of taking on a character and revealing common human weaknesses and the affects these personality traits can have on other people.<br /><br />The structure used in this book is unlike any I have ever seen.  It reminds me of the ties on a railroad.  One chapter will speak very broadly about the whole movement west, and then the next will discuss the Joad family's own problem concerning this matter.  But really they are all connected to each other and continue in this repeating pattern.  I feel that the most important theme in the book is mans inhumanity to man.  Steinbeck wants to prove that almost all of the hardships that this certain family endures are a direct result of another person's action rather than the weather or some other inanimate object.  He does do this extremely well and I highly commend him for this.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I can't let go of it and I don't want to. This movie grabbed my heart and hasn't let go. Heath Ledger is BRILLIANT and Jake Gyllenhaal is WONDERFUL. And what they have done together is SUPERB. BRAVO, to the GENIUS of Ang Lee. What a beautful and heartbreaking ( it hurts so good ) gift he has given us. This movie is the definition of love whoever you are.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|Foo Fighters' second album is probably their best one. It's loud, it's quiet in places, it's catchy, it's just brilliant. The Colour And The Shape (TCATS) is basically born out of Dave's divorce, and thus many songs encapsulate his anger, despair, sadness, reluctance to let go. It's really an adventure through a small part of his life, starting with him quietly moping about how he's never been so scared, and ending with him emphatically shouting to the top of his lungs about how he isn't scared anymore. <br /> <br />It's really well put together, showcasing the ups and downs of a relationship that's no longer working out. The only song that doesn't seem to be about the divorce is 'My Hero,' which is also one of the best songs on the CD, but straight away it delves back into Grohl's psyche. The lyrics are vague, but you can tell what the songs are about if you listen carefully. My personal favourite track is 'New Way Home,' Foo Fighters always seem to know how to end an album, and TCATS ends with a bang. <br /> <br />But, anyway, I give this album 5 out of 5 stars. It's perfect in my opinion, my favourite album of all time.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This movie kept you going from start to finish. You were left feeling the sorrow and the seperation felt by the two main characters. Someone made a comment to me about how far we have come since the 1960's when this story took place. I made quick to say that had we really? Look at Matthew Shepard. This movie shows you that despite what the world thinks is right or wrong, it's about loving someone. That love can survive alot of things. I think that anyone who sees it will not be disappointed and that each person will get something different out of the story. It is very deservant of the attention and nominations it is receiving. Hats off to the two actors in their portral of such a touching story.
0823003590|5.0|This is an excellent book on drawing portraits. Yes, it does not cover every angle and does not cover a variety of media. However, those are minor limitations.     The whole premise of this book is that drawing shadow shapes accurately and expressively produces great portraits. I am self-taught and it is THE book that made a difference in my approach to portrait drawing, and drawing in general.    The author focuses on key aspects of rendering the head beginning with gesture. Then he addresses different features--eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and hair, with useful tips for each. Once you have developed your seeing and rendering skills, you should be able to draw the head from any angle. The author correctly does not focus on this. It will come naturally.     He also provides tips for using color. Again, once you know the basics about shapes, values, etc, you should be able to render these in any medium. Finally, the hybrid animal/human drawings are included simply to make the point that any face can be constructed once you have mastered the basics.    All in all one of the best art instruction books ever. I would go so far as to say that I do not need to read another book on portraiture after this one. It has been that good for me.

0694003611|5.0|This is the best children's bedtime book because it is so clever at \\"tricking\\" your mind into believing it is time for bed. It has one beautiful color illustration of a bedroom that is repeated every other page.  As the story progresses, the very colorful and bright room slowly gets darker and darker until it is definitely nighttime.  In between the color illustrations are black, grey and white imagines, I imagine a take on how things start to look in the dark.  It's a marvelous concept and does a great job at making you feel that night has slowly come upon you.  I loved this book growing up and my son is absolutely mesmorized at the images every time we read it to him.  It really does help to put him in a sleep-mode before bed.  I can't recommend it higher!
0743243315|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.  The author has a remarkable ability to make you care about her characters, from the amazing development of the heroine, to the wide variety of supporting characters.
B00005JGAB|4.0|Blitzkrieg Bop, Beat On The Brat, Judy Is A Punk, Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue and Havana Affair (much better on It`s Alive)are all good songs, but the rest is just over-the-top simple and repetitive. Worth buying just for the historical/importance value, but not their best album.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I don't really like watching kiddie cartoons, but let me tell you that this movie Spirited Away took my breath away. The story tells about a young girl who is searching a way to free her parents from a terrible curse. This story is about courage and friendship as Sen makes friends with Haku, the dragon. I really love this movie and to me, I was surprise that this movie came from Disney. Great job to both Disney and Hayao Miyazaki. Don't hesitate to buy this movie!! You'll LOVE IT!!!\\" <br />
B00002E224|4.0|This film took me back to my own youth, a big chunk of which was spent wandering around Europe seeking that special someone and trying to put together a career that made sense.  In that setting, chance encounters with extraordinary people were rare but possible, when I met someone who lifted the veil of young lonliness in amazing conversation and unique moments that stand out in my memory like gems.  So I find the experience of the protagonists realistic and downright lovely - they are young, their whole lives are ahead of them so all they can see are possibilities and their ideals, and lukcy them, they are beautiful.<br /><br />The acting, much of which must have been adlibing, is utterly superb.  As yet, these two characters do not reflect any special talents and are not unrealistically insightful or perfectly desirable.  Indeed, the boy is rather callow and from a broken home, while the girl is perhaps neurotically angry.  They are just very real, full of need the way the young often feel, and wondering if they can do something that surpasses their backgrounds.<br /><br />I loved the way that they were drawn together, just this sudden rapport that allowed them to talk, to touch, to open to the delicious mystery of intimacy.  It reminds me of the first time I went out with my wife:  we talked and talked and talked and by the end of the day I felt like we might talk for the rest of our lives.  We met by chance on a train in Japan and a year later were married.  This film shows such a similar thing.<br /><br />It is also very subtle, with plenty of themes implied but not fully elaborated on.  This is so nice in an era of crass films, where everything is unambiguous and stupidly explicit.  You don't even know if they consummated anything.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  Their secret, fragile moment of discovery is simply brilliantly portrayed.
031286504X|4.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" is an amazing story describing a plague that turns the entire world into Vampires, with the exception of one man, who spends the rest of his life simply existing and fighting to maintain his life by killing vampires. It is a very interesting story and I was intrigued by the day to day events the protagonist goes through and the effect the plague has on his sanity. The storytelling is not chronological and jumps right into things, with the protagonist recalling how the plague started and events that happened before it became full blown.<br /><br />The story is amazing and I was very intrigued at how Mattheson can make simple day to day chores interesting. It's an amazing concept and doesn't seem dated at all, even though the story was written over 50 years ago (it takes place in the \\"future\\" of 1970).<br /><br />My main problem with this book was that it ended halfway through. Apparently it's a collection of short stories, and \\"I Am Legend\\" only takes up about 170 pages. I read about half of the other stories and they are okay, but nothing too good and I lost interest quickly. Some are a few pages and some are several chapters. I got bored with them quickly and they're pretty much your typical science fiction from the 50s, although some were written later. I do think the \\"I Am Legend\\" story alone is worth the price of the book.
B0002F6BRE|2.0|I remember all the hype that surrounded \\"Elf\\" when it was released a couple of years ago. I finally watched it yesterday and I was disappointed. The premise of the film is funny enough: Will Ferrell plays Buddy, an elf from the North Pole who can't help noticing that he's \\"different\\" from all of Santa's other helpers. One day Buddy finally learns the truth about his background: he's not an elf at all, he's actually a human being. His real father (James Caan) is a publisher in New York City who also happens to be on Santa's \\"Naughty List.\\" Buddy journeys to Manhattan to find his father, who has a wife and another son, and all hell breaks loose when Buddy's elvish ways clash with his father's Scrooge-like attitude and big-city lifestyle.<br /><br />There are definitely some funny moments in this film. Ferrell is at his best when he's doing slapstick comedy, but this movie primarily relies on stupid humor and unnecessary crudeness. (Do we really need the 45-second belching scene? Why are there people who actually find that sort of thing funny? It's disgusting!) The scenes between Ferrell and Caan are definitely the best moments in the film. They have a great on-screen chemistry, as do Caan and Mary Steenburgen, who plays his unbelievably patient wife.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't think this movie was very funny. Of course, I didn't think \\"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\\" was funny, either, so that should tell you something about the kind of movies that appeal to me. If you're a fan of Ferrell and enjoy nonsense humor, you'll probably like \\"Elf.\\" However, if you're like me and do not enjoy stupid humor, you should probably skip this one.
B00006GA4C|5.0|Picture this...The Grand Funk Railroad pulling into Graham Central Station...Do you think we could've handled it?  <br />(sounds like a great home-made compilation cd to me!)
B000000OY9|3.0|Reviewers are confronted opinions about this album. I would adopt a intermediate position. Is not so bad like Trans but is far from the best Young's records. <br />If we take in account that Young has made records like Harvest, Rust never sleeps, Ragged Glory, Zuma, Sleep with angels or, maybe, Prairie Wind this is a minor record
0312330529|5.0|This is one of the most spectacular books I've ever read and probably one of the greatest novels ever written.  It is beautifully poetic but also heart-breakingly real.  I laughed, I almost cried, and I'm blown away.  Do yourself a favor and read this book!  It's incredible.  You have to read to believe how GOOD it is.
B00005NC66|3.0|It's an ok film. I liked Contempt better althought breathless is mentioned as one of the great films ever made. I understand that it was an important movie that deviated from the conventional style back then and and it was an early new-wave movie after the 400 blows. I get all the points godard tries to make in this movie. Like emphasizing on unnecessary details(the chat on the street, in the bedroom) and cutting short major events(killing the cop). But at the end of the day I was not very impressed, the movie didn't catch my attention. On the other hand the 30 minute sequence in the apartment between bridget bardot and ger husband in Contempt was intruging, complex and masterful.
B0006B29WA|5.0|This was a great album i like every song on this cd, i have not bought their sophmore cd hopefully a slump is not in the future.
B00005NTN5|5.0|Lately i've been obsessing over jennifer tilly, who i can't believe is 47 now and still looks great. I had never seen this film before, until i went to the video store, and the lady who worked there told me is is a very good movie, so i rented it. Jennifer tilly and gina seemed to be very comfortable during those sexy scenes, and the chemistry between them made me think if they are really into women in their real lives who knows. This was a good come back for gina especially after that dreadful film showgirls. She really does have talent and it's good that she appeared in this movie with tilly, especially since it turned out to be a great well acted thriller. I'm sure lesbians and bisexuals like myself would enjoy this movie more than the average viewer. Like the review on this page by the woman who said she felt like becoming a lesbian because the two lead females were so sexy together. They were i agree. And i'm not surprised that her brother didn't like it. No straight guy would like a movie where two beautiful lesbians are going to steal mob money and run away together where no guy gets in on the action. For some reason females tend to like this movie more than guys, because of our stereotypical cynical judgemental sexist prejudice society. But anywho, great movie. 5 stars in my opinion. Tilly tends to have those provocative and sexy roles because she really gives great performances as a sexy vuluptuous woman because that is what she is in real life. I especially liked her as a blonde in bride of chucky. You can't help but love that sexy \\"china doll\\"... and her beautiful and big knockers hehe.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|I like Ashton, and his attempt to spread out is admirable. This movie, initially intriguing, collapses with the preppie angle. It's interesting to see \\"Earl's\\" brother at an earlier time.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|I watched this with some trepidation. I'd seen previews before that seemed quite interesting, but I was sort of wondering why I'd not heard of this when it came out. It looked creepy, but in a good way. But on the other hand previews can be deceiving, especially when they get all the good stuff into that sixty seconds. But this is stellar. <br /> <br />Scene by scene, minute by minute this is engaging, eerie, troubling filmmaking. You're never sure what's going to happen next, and for me, at least, I was kept on the edge the whole time.  <br /> <br />I worried that the ending wouldn't be satisfying, or that it would just descend into cheap horror. It doesn't, though. The ending is solid. It makes sense out of most of what came before and wraps it all up in a way that's ultimately revealing, reasonable and almost uplifting. Christian Bale is a tremendous actor. And the weight loss... It is incredible that he could/would do that.
B00009MGGP|4.0|One of the best miniseries of the 90's is as relevent today as it was then. The BC does what it does best, namely qulity drama with great actors. This tale of political intrigue is well worth watching.
B000001Y5D|5.0|This album is simply awesome, really. It's a shame that this group only has one release, I've been listening 4 Non Blondes since 1992, and I'm still doing that and believe me, I love Linda Perry voice and how she plays the guitar, her way to do it is awesome, and the songs What's Up and Dear Mr. President are the best for me. I don't know what could happen with the band, but by far, a great score.! <br />I'm sure I could rate each song: <br /> <br /> 1. Train 7/10 <br /> 2. Superfly 8/10 <br /> 3. What's Up 10/10 <br /> 4. Pleasantly Blue 6/10 <br /> 5. Morphine & Chocolate 6/10 <br /> 6. Spaceman 8/10 <br /> 7. Old Mr. Heffer 6/10 <br /> 8. Calling all the people 6/10 <br /> 9. Dear Mr. President 10/10 <br />10. Drifting 9/10 <br />11. No place like home 7/10 <br /> <br />  This is how I enjoy each song, now... how do you?.
0393327655|5.0|By page 3 I knew there would be plenty of Amazonians just waiting to hit this book over the head. It is quite undestandable. Sam Harris takes an extremely uncompromising and negative view of the role of religion throughout history and up to the present moment. He even goes so far to indicate that the backwards effect of religion probably set Western Modernism back at least four centuries. He asks us: What would it have been like if the Internet could have been set up in the early 1600's instead of now? What if Medicine could have reached today's level 500 years ago, and so on. These questions beg for answers under his philosophical construct. His view may not be popular in the US (or Saudi Arabia for that matter), but just because some of us may not like it, doesn't mean we shouldn't think about it.
0743506650|5.0|The audio book is read by the master himself, Stephen King. Hearing the book in his voice is reason enough to purchase as his personality flavors the reading so that you get deeper insights into his thinking. I've listened to the book three times. You'll get what he likes and dislikes about the writing craft, and related factors such as Conferences and Writer Groups just based on his voice inflections.<br /><br />Part autobiography and part writing wisdom, King masterfully intertwines both into a comprehensive understanding of the demands of writing and his personal journey. He relates stories from his childhood, college, marriage, and the accident that almost took his life. Each has lessons about writing if you listen closely.<br /><br />He addresses many issues about writing from craft to habits for writing. Two areas I valued are his advice to pay attention to story and language. Also \\"his\\" method of writing with the 'door' closed and, later, opened.<br /><br />There is much of benefit for Stephen King fans who want to know more about him and, yes, his state of mind when writing such classics as Carrie, Misery, Cujo, and the Stand. Writers will benefit from his blunt advice and demanding expectations if one wants to become a better writer.<br /><br />Stephen King makes no promise that you will become the next best seller novelist. His sound advice can help a committed writer improve. His anecdotes and humor, especially in his voice, will leave you smiling and that much more knowledgeable about him on writing.<br /><br />Whether or not you have read the book, you will get so much more out of the audio version.
B00004XPPE|5.0|I used to believe that this film, by the extraordinary Sidney Lumet, was the ugly kid sister to Dr. Strangelove. But forty years later, it is this film that suddenly seems more fresh and pertinent, not because of the threat of nuclear holocaustic errors, but moreso because of the kind of leadership technologically oriented societies need. Henry Fonda's president, who is never even called by his name in the film, embodies the type of leader we no longer have. And that is what makes this movie more chilling and important than Kubrick's statement

The time could not be<br />more ripe for author Alan Moore's<br />signature work, V FOR VENDETTA, to<br />finally be issued by DC's Vertigo<br />line as a mass market hardcover<br />edition.<br />Many know Moore by deconstructionist<br />superhero epics such as the award-<br />winning WATCHMEN and the precedent-<br />setting MARVELMAN  (the latter known<br />as MIRACLEMAN, thanks to a certain<br />company's corporate bullying).<br />Others revere his myth-shaping work<br />on the SWAMP THING and PROMETHEA, or<br />his stunning takes on pulp literature<br />through THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY<br />GENTLEMEN and TOM STRONG.<br /><br />It is V FOR VENDETTA, however, which<br />stands as Moore's most personal,pertinent,<br />and provocative work. Rooted in the author's<br />aversion to the totalitarian mandates<br />taking precedence in the Great Britain<br />of the 1970s and 1980s, the gripping<br />saga spins a definitive discourse<br />on the evils of Fascism, and is<br />equally astute in spelling out<br />exactly what Anarchy entails.<br /><br />In the principal characters of the masked<br />V and the hapless Evey, we are provided<br />with a rich tapestry of what a lost<br />society will breed  as its own deadly<br />cure, and the costs that all will pay.<br />From a seeming madman offering sanity<br />with a blazing finality, to a naive<br />child compelled to grow up faster than<br />she bargained for, we see the desperation<br />of insane times rise up to oppose the<br />anal-retentive atrocities of a racist,<br />sexist, religiously hypocritical,<br />rampantly homophobic regime which is<br />part-Hitler, part-Thatcher, pure<br />abomination. Decadent with the self-<br />justified brutality of its evil,<br />imperiously smug in its ruthless<br />trampling of civil liberties, it<br />is a landscape which is all too<br />familiar.<br /><br />Faced with the ultimate in State-<br />sponsored terrorism, V's deadly<br />answer is to give the State a taste<br />-measure for measure-  of its own<br />terror, even as he teaches Evey<br />that for true Anarchy to take root,<br />all wielders of terrorism and<br />weaponry must inevitably stand<br />aside, or be caught in their own<br />violent tide.<br /><br />Moore, with the superbly-etched<br />illustrations of David Lloyd,<br />creates a bold cavalcade of<br />characters caught up in the<br />spin of genocide, and charts<br />each person's growth or destruction<br />as they come face-to-face with a<br />society's outrage, retribution,<br />and revelation. No easy tale of<br />one-dimensional rights and wrongs,<br />V FOR VENDETTA is a voyage into<br />the myriad motivations of human<br />endeavor, showing how the<br />deliberate misplacement of<br />ethical balance can set our<br />moral insights utterly<br />askew.<br /><br />In a world where yesteryear's<br />alliances can breed today's<br />enmities, and the willingness<br />to forget past lessons imperil<br />all our tomorrows, the need of<br />this tale to be read, viewed,<br />and thoroughly perceived on<br />every level could not be more<br />important.<br /><br />In a world which needs the real-<br />life actions of a Citizen V, we<br />are already lost in a wilderness<br />of our own fatal convenience.<br /><br />Time to find a better way.<br />For all our sakes.rism, V's deadly  answer is to give the State a taste  -measure for measure-  of its own  terror, even as he teaches Evey  that for true Anarchy to take root,  all wielders of terrorism and  weaponry must inevitably stand  aside, or be caught in their own  violent tide.    Moore, with the superbly-etched  illustrations of David Lloyd,   creates a bold cavalcade of   characters caught up in the   spin of genocide, and charts   each person's growth or destruction   as they come face-to-face with a  society's outrage, retribution,   and revelation. No easy tale of   one-dimensional rights and wrongs,   V FOR VENDETTA is a voyage into  the myriad motivations of human  endeavor, showing how the   deliberate misplacement of   ethical balance can set our   moral insights utterly  askew.    In a world where yesteryear's  alliances can breed today's  enmities, and the willingness  to forget past lessons imperil  all our tomorrows, the need of  this tale to be read, viewed,  and thoroughly perceived on  every level could not be more  important.    In a world which needs the real-  life actions of a Citizen V, we  are already lost in a wilderness  of our own fatal convenience.    Time to find a better way.   For all our sakes.
1400032717|4.0|This book was an excellent book to read about a person who has autism. This book shows what its like for him in life and what he is thinking about. I liked this book because it was very different then anything that I have ever read and it has a superb plot. The main character goes to a \\"special\\" school and is very good in mathematics, and wants to take a level A math class. He is also trying to figure out who murdered the dog, Wellington. It has many different twists in it and it keeps you guessing what will happen next. Also, it is easy reading. While the illustrations shorten the book, they also add to what is going on in Christopher's head and what he sees. All in all, I think that this book was an excellent one, to read and I would recommend it to anyone especially if you are working with autistic children.
B00001OH7P|5.0|I am not a critic but an old fan. The first I heard of this record was when I was 16 and already an avid David fan.  Having learned both Hunky Dory and Diamond Dogs by heart, I then had the delerious pleasure of memorising Ziggy Stardust and Alladin Sane.  Also, soon after, there was Young Americans and then Low etc. David Bowie also led me to Iggy Pop...an actual God... <br /> <br />I must say that though no record is ever perfect...except to the given listener...that this is as perfect as a pop record could be for it's time...from every perspective for me it was a guiding light in the despair I felt at looming adulthood.   <br /> <br />Above all,it inspired discovery of new musical frontiers and the philosophy and spirit at play amidst them. This is a gas record, superb, well lit and the guitar is outtasight...And David has a theatrical background, with the likes of the great Lindsay Kemp. David is an actor and a singer and an artist and trendsetter in every artistic field.  (Though he can never be Iggy Pop!)   <br /> <br />He is a feminine spirit...that is what most guys find hard to take...that he can attract the girls and the gay guys...simultaneously for his sensitive and softly spoken British popster style.  Too cool for school! <br /> <br />Love to David and Iggy always. <br /> <br />Asheeka
0060899190|5.0|I wasnt overwhelmed by the content of the book but I gave this book 5 stars for the execution of a well conceived idea. This is really a unique idea so it derves the A rating. I may have given it 4.5 stars because some of the postcards kind of run into eachother in the book and they get lost easily.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Disney's 1940 critically-acclaimed film Fantasia is breath-taking.  Not only is it my favorite Disney film, it's amazing combining of dreamy art and classical music is awe-inspiring and totally unique.  I remember as a child the closing episode was one I could not watch for such a long time at nighttime because it scared me so much.  Brilliant, in every aspect.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|More accurately I've read every page of reviews here and carefully read each and every one with on or two stars.  As you can see by what I rated the movie I don't need anybody telling me how good it is, but I do need some perspective on what isn't good about it. <br /> <br />I did not find that perspective, while several people were kind enough to tell me, \\"IT SUCKED\\" few elaborated and most of those that didn't tell the truth.  I'm not accusing anyone of lying here, but when someone points out that the princess is stereotypical when there is no princess (nor royalty of any kind) it seems a bit odd.  When people talk about the two factions ruling humanity and there are not two factions, that seems odd to me. <br /> <br />When someone went into great detail about how the movie was unrealistic because of heat shield failure never taking into account that there is no mention of a heat shield in the entire movie that was a little strange.  This isn't limited to people here, a professional reviewer made reference to a nuclear war that never happened. <br /> <br />The list goes on, and here's the point: You have to pay attention to this movie.  I understand that it can be nice to have a movie playing in the background, but this isn't the movie to do it with because it looks like everyone who's tried somehow managed to remember things that didn't happen. <br /> <br />If you want some help getting your bearings move a little bit down the post and I'll give you some background in case you miss it, though I don't see how you can if you are paying attention. <br /> <br />There were also a couple of \\"rabid fans\\" who felt let down or betrayed, and about three reviews that actually gave reasons why the person didn't like it that applied to the movie.  I think the problem was that they had the wrong ideas going in. <br /> <br />This movie is not about gigantic antiseptic spaceships with flashy lasers.  (It is actually about people, nine of them to be exact.)  It is also not aboutthe people who captain such great ships, the characters are on a small old ship, they don't have gigantic state rooms because they couldn't afford it.  In fact when the movie starts they're in a bad place trying not to worry about whether they can afford to keep the ship in repair and whether they'll be able to buy food. <br /> <br />Some of the planets are still in the process of being settled which means there are not yet incredible buildings with blinking lights, but instead people working off the land until they can afford the blinky lights. <br /> <br />In this movie you will not find aliens or evil empires. <br /> <br />You also won't find stock characters, just like with real people if you try to fit one of the characters into a convenient category you will fail.  If you don't believe me then try, watch the movie, find the category you think fits best for each character, then watch it again with that in mind.  The stereotype won't fit because no one is that simple in either real life or the movie. <br /> <br />Someone complained that he didn't know whether to think of one character as funny or tough, they were trying too hard to pigeonhole the character, real people are both funny and tough.  Real people make jokes when bad things are happening also. <br /> <br />About five minutes ago I told someone I didn't want to call Serenity the \\"best\\" movie because best is so subjective of a word, however it is the only one in nay genre that made me want to go out and tell people about it.  She said that's the highest complement you can give, maybe she's right, maybe she's wrong, but it is important. <br /> <br />If you want to understand how good the movie is, without watching it, you can't look at box office returns or sales figures, not matter how good or bad they are (I don't know which they are), you need to look at how it effects people.  Look at how much people care about this movie, the people didn't magically do that on their own, it is because the movie is that good. <br /> <br />There is a reason that we get reports of 90 year old women coming to and loving a movie that most would peg (incorrectly) as something for 15 year old boys.  (Don't get me wrong the 15 year olds like it too.)  There's a reason that fans come from all ages in between, that fans are not limited by their politics or nationalities, that fans are not even limited by genre. <br /> <br />People who say, \\"I hate sci-fi,\\" love this. <br />People who say, \\"I love sci-fi,\\" love this. <br /> <br />People in between love it too. <br /> <br />If you want my advice go out and buy it, make sure you get widescreen. <br /> <br />If you want more rational advice here it is: If something can create fans who care so much, if it can appeal to people, male and female, from all age groups, if it can do all of that isn't it worth at least renting to see how it managed that? <br /> <br />The rational thing, the logical thing, is to go out and give it a chance.  Rent it, give it your full attention, watch it at least twice to know whether or not you really got it the first time around, and if you like it come back here and buy it.  If you don't like it please come here and say why, and please, if you cite examples, cite ones that are really from the movie. <br /> <br />The thing coming from someone who's already seen it is this: I can honestly say that I believe that if you do that you will come back here and buy it.  Maybe write a review better than mine while you're at it. <br /> <br />- <br />- <br /> <br />I said that I'd try to help you through the back-story because some people seem to get it confused even though I think it is very clear.  The problem is that this will take a lot of words and not do the movie any justice. <br /> <br />The earth could no longer support the all of the people on it and the major technological and economic powers teamed up to jump ship as soon as a new home could be found.  That new home was a solar system full of worlds and moons thatcould be teraformed. <br /> <br />As happens in real life here on earth some people prospered and others didn't, those that prospered were on the \\"Central Planets\\" and they formed an interplanetary parliament called the Alliance with the goal of bringing light, order and democracy to all worlds, as in real life other people didn't like the idea of people from some foreign land (planet) telling them what to do and there was a war.  Outnumbered and outgunned the Independents (also known as Browncoats) lost. <br /> <br />The Alliance, while a progressive government trying to spread such things as equal rights, healthcare, civilization, and enlightenment, is out of it's depth in the outer planets, they lack both the manpower and the understanding needed.  Like all governments it also has it's secrets. <br /> <br />The movie gets all of this across very quickly and, in my opinion, clearly. <br /> <br />It also introduces the rumor of Reavers, brutal feral like humans (again, there are no aliens in the movie) who some believe don't really exist and others believe that, while sophisticated enough to pilot and maintain space ships and capable of working together flawlessly, have degenerated to the point that they do not merely rape and murder but also eat people alive and use their skins as clothing. <br /> <br />The movie manages to say all of this (well some of it is shown instead of said) seamlessly and in a non-contrived fashion in less than ten minutes. <br /> <br />After you have all of that covered it moves on (again seamlessly) and you see one of the things lurking in the underbelly of the largely benevolent government.  Experiments are being done on an innocent girl and while the purpose is unclear you lean that they have made a psychic and a \\"living weapon\\" out of her.  The fact that there can be a psychic is probably the only thing that requires significant suspension of disbelief.  But since the movie doesn't force hyperspace, transporters, or any such thing onyou it's a fair trade off. <br /> <br />The girl is rescued by her brother and the movie continues finally moving into the present tense as a government operative reviews footage of the escape. <br /> <br />The worry is that as a psychic who was shown off to important officials she has picked up classified information that not even the operative himself is cleared to know.  His job is to keep secrets, not know them. <br /> <br />Where the girl, River, is, is on a ship that could actually be lived in, though a couple of people in the movie call it crap.  In my mind this was a refreshing change,  while I have no problem with the ships in most sci-fi I really can't imagine people actually calling them home, this one is different.  The ship is Serenity and its crew does jobs both legal and otherwise. <br /> <br />That is really all you need to know by way of back story and I don't want to spoil anything, I should say again that the characters can not simply be laid out, they are neither stereotypical nor copied so I can't just say who they are or even who they are like, you have to see it.  If I were to try to write a short description of any one of them it would turn out longer than everything I have written so far, the amount that you can pick up from an expression lasting only a couple of frames is incredible. <br /> <br />By now you probably already know if you're going to see it or not.  I hope you do, I really think everyone should get a chance to see something this good.  I registered (reregistered to be more accurate) just so I could tell people about it.
B0000025ZF|4.0|Roger Waters basically made three albums after Pink Floyd broke up, and this is the best of them. It's very much a concept album, and though a couple of the songs are good listens on their own, you can't really \\"get it\\" unless you listen to the whole thing. The lyrics are as clever as any Roger Waters wrote for Pink Floyd, but unlike The Final Cut, there are a lot of humerous touches. The best part of the musical side of the album is an extremely vital performance throughout from Eric Clapton, a big contrast to his solo work at the time, which was buried in overproduction. You're probably looking at this review if you're a recent discoverer of Pink Floyd and wondering what else is worth having. I recommend giving this a shot before buying any of the post 1983 David Gilmour only Pink Floyd releases.

It contains lots of step by step instructions as well as anatomy and different ways to make your dragon unique. This book is also done with great passion for the subject.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore is truly revolutionary.  I was blessed to be able to see him live and to hear his message in person.  He has a vision for our country and for our values.  He sees that we have a problem.  The problem is that we are killing and fighting for an unwinnable cause.  That kids are dying for oil and big business.  He also wants us to listen to what people are saying, Good and Bad, to be informed.  We are living in times where the president is allowing ultra-conservative men on the supreme court who are only in their early 50's.  Our president is making it so our core values of liberty and freedom and human rights are being dimminished daily.  Michael askes us to fight with peace and with the power of the ballot.  I am so thankful for him and for his willingness to be hated to get the truth out there.  This movie is crucial to the changes that we need to make and soon!
B00005JNRE|5.0|After this movie was over the audience clapped.  I loved every minute of it.  I came away light-hearted and smiling.  With a world full of dark smut and sadness at every turn I found the magical world of Nanny McPhee a delightful change.  It was just what I wanted to see.   <br />Don't go to pick it apart, go for child in you, you won't be sorry. <br />
B00008WT5M|4.0|This is one of the finest efforts by the group Ac/Dc. I can remember when I was just about 10 years old setting in my older sisters car jamming this album on tape. <br /> <br />Stand Out Tracks are: <br />Thunderstruck (single) <br />Fire Your Guns <br />Moneytalks (single & one of the all time great Ac/Dc tracks) <br />Are You Ready (single)
B0000027I6|2.0|This album seems to try to harken back to the \\"big\\" sound and ambition of the last two Pink Floyd albums. Unfortunately it stumbles out of the gate. Unlike \\"Pros and Cons\\" and \\"KAOS,\\" the musical efforts here are rudimentary and heavy handed. The lyrics are mostly muttered, and for the most part extremely caustic and bitter - this may have been what some fans were waiting for, but unless you thought \\"The Final Cut\\" was the best Pink Floyd album I'd approach this with caution. As this was effectively the last Roger Waters album, it seems like he had run out of gas at this point and realized it.
B000000WHC|4.0|Gary Moore has the touch, the guts, and the credibility. Yes, most of the time, it`s here on this CD, called Still Got the Blues. On Track 1 Moving on, Moore set`s the standard all trough this CD. Moore`s vocal has the \\"blues voice\\" for sure, and this track doesn`t dissapoint as it move`s on, from the beginning to the end. Track 2 Oh Pretty Woman, is blue`s from the \\"old school standard\\", with Albert King on the guitar who know`s how to \\"milk out\\" enough \\"iiiiiiaaaaa\\" and\\"woaaaa\\" from his guitar, that makes you scream for more \\"Moore\\". Track 3 Walking by myself, is more upbeat, a \\"rockin\\" bluestune, with an effective harmonica, that makes<br /><br />it an ok listen. Track 4 Still got the Blues was a hit back then in the beginning of the 90 th`s. It`s an earfiller, with a very open soundpicture, that give`s Moore`s voice enough room to spark `s a moody feeling all trough. Track 5 Texas Strut `s<br /><br />is ok, like a \\"poor man`s ZZ Top song, on a bad day. It also have the \\"ho,ho,ho\\" Z.Z.Top vocal growl, included. Track 6 Too Tired, is  standard blue`s with Albert Collins back on guitar. Ok, but nothing more. Track 7 King of the Blues, is<br /><br />standard blues too, but has a certain spark, with good guitarplaying by Moore, and an effective Hammond Organ in the background. Track 8 As the years Go Passing by, is a let down, to slow, to little guts`y, and doesn`t deliver`s at all.<br /><br />Track 9. MIdnight Blues follows in the same footsteeps,but has a moody and relaxable atmosphere, all trough.  Track 10 That kind of Woman, has a certain flair`e, with it`s honky tonk rythm walkalong trough the song. Track 11 All your Love sound`s better. It`s uplifting, and a joy to listen to. Very good solo guitar play by Moore, and it`s soulfoul enough from every \\"Blues brother\\" out there. Track 12 Stop Messin` around, has  every ingridient, to put a standardmark qualitywise on this one. Yees. Gary Moore has the blues feel most of the time on this one. Quite enjoyable this CD.
B000092ZYX|2.0|I remember the great hype when this album was going to come out. I had heard from some that it was going to be a continuation of Radiohead's more experimental side (Kid A, Amnesiac), while others said it was a return to the guitar-driven \\"anthems\\" of old (The Bends, OK Computer). What I didn't know is that both of those sides would come together in a mediocre fashion.<br /><br />Simply put, this album is a great dissapointment and just so mediocre for Radiohead. This would've been a great album for a new band or a spectaular debut for another, but coming from such amazing masterpieces such as Kid A and Amnesiac (As you can tell, I love those albums), it just sounds like a band wanting to sound like Radiohead.<br /><br />For starters, there are some good tunes on here. Not great, just good. 2+2=5 has a very interesting beginning riff and an amazing climax. Unfortuantly, it goes into a cheesy ending sounding a lot like Blur. Sit Down, Stand Up suffers from the same fate of having an amazing eerie beginning and turning into a bland \\"rush electronic\\" ending.<br /><br />The only real keepers on this album is Sail To The Moon, a slow and bleak ballad bringing back the sad atmosphere of OK Computer. The Gloaming has a very interesting beat and an overall eerie feel. The 'hit' single There There, at first annoyed me, but I have grown to like it a little bit more over time. But then, we go back to experimenting-just-for-the-hell-of-it-becuase-we're-Radiohead mode for the rest of the album. Backdrifts just meanders with no real purpose, and Go To Sleep...well, puts me to sleep. We Suck Young Blood sounds like something from a campy halloween movie. And \\"I Will\\" just plain sucks.<br /><br />What I really liked about the earlier albums was the bleak and depressing feel throughout the whole cds. On here, it's dark, but it feels forced. It just felt like Radiohead wanted to make an album \\"just because we're Radiohead.\\" I hope that the next one will be better, but I doubt it. I heard they were going in some weird new \\"we're gonna do something completly different becuase we don't like ANYTHING we've ever made and our fans are cool hipsters, so we gotta be hip and cool and release several E.P.'s\\" and all that crap. Thanks guys.it. I heard they were going in some weird new \\"we're gonna do something completly different becuase we don't like ANYTHING we've ever made and our fans are cool hipsters, so we gotta be hip and cool and release several E.P.'s\\" and all that crap.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Leave it to studio executives to screw up the best thing to hit sci-fi in decades. <br /> <br />Firefly is a fantastic story-oriented, character driven sci-fi western - YES, sci-fi western.  Sounds odd, and the pilot is a bit slow to get going, but once you hit episode 3 it's your new addiction.  When my wife and I got through the last episode, we were really sad that there weren't any more to watch. <br /> <br />We did watch the 'Serenity' movie, which was a good follow-up. <br /> <br />I strongly, fully, totally, absolutely, whole-heartedly recommend  this show.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This is the hands down best effort from the band Ac/Dc in the Bon Scott era. Everyone knows of this album and there is a good reason why becuase it ROCKS from start to finish.

Highway To Hell (single)  Girls Got Rhythm (single)  Touch Too Much (single)  Shot Down In Flames  If You Want Blood (You've Got It)
0385507755|1.0|I'm a drug addict. <br /> <br />I'm clean and sober today thanks to the rooms of AA and NA, and the people in them, and a great sponsor, and my Higher power. <br /> <br />I choose to be clean and free today. I nearly died 3 years ago after OD'ing on legal drugs, prescribed for my by a doctor. If I had died, I would have left behind my husband, 2 beautiful children, my 3 sisters, my parents, and many friends. <br /> <br />When I first entered recovery, I was shattered, and my very personality was destroyed from years of self-abuse. I was quite impressionable during my first year of recovery. <br /> <br />I have looked at this book and saw it as filled with artificial drama and juvenile attempts at creating emotion, written by a narcissistic punk who wanted to seem \\"macho\\" or \\"cool\\" and hopefully pick up some female companionship in the process. <br /> <br />I say that I am in recovery. Any true addict or alcoholic is either in recovery or relapse. We never \\"recover\\", as Frey claimed. <br /> <br />If I had read this book early on, I probably would have fallen for it. I, too, might have worshiped the author and considered it part of a higher force filling me with courage. Once it was revealed as a sham, an intentional misuse of license, such as claiming one has cancer when one does not, I would have felt angry and betrayed. That was an emotion common to me in my first year of sobriety. <br /> <br />If I had picked up a drink or a drug back then, it still would have been my choice - a choice based on my continuous battle with a physical disease which is manifested in the brain. It would have served no purpose to place blame - yet still, Frey's behavior is very, very wrong. <br /> <br />Alcoholism and drug addiction are a progressive, fatal disease. Many try to win the battle - many more succumb. <br /> <br />As one who struggles daily with this disease, I do not appreciate being used and manipulated by a self-centered thug who capitalizes on the misfortunes of others. Outright lying about his involvement in a train/car wreck where two families lost their daughters is not an \\"exaggeration\\". Frey's conduct is reprehensible and has done serious damage to these families. (Ref: The Smoking Gun) <br /> <br />I thank God that I do have Him as my Higher Power, and that while through His grace I have survived another 24 hours, my faith tells me that He ultimately will write the last chapter in Frey's book. <br /> <br />Perhaps Frey's next non-fiction piece will exploit children born with genetic defects, hospice patients, or military widows. <br /> <br />We can hardly wait.
0790729377|5.0|I'll keep it very simple!  I'm a southern lit. freak and am often fairly critical of film adaptations of the classics, which tend to portray characters as one-dimensional beings. However, the Leigh-Brando adaptation of \\"Streetcar\\" is mesmerizing, and in my opinion, true to the intent of brilliant southern playwright Tennessee Williams, wonderfully depicting both the internal and external collide of two worlds--the idyllic and the realistic--and how one cannot flourish unless the other falters. Those who love southern literature as I do may find it interesting to compare and contrast the character development of Blanche to similar \\"fallen\\" Southern belles such as Mitchell's Scarlett O'Hara and Faulkner's Temple Drake. Overall, this film is a must for any Williams fan!
B000002U82|5.0|If anyone dares say that this record is bad. They wouldnt know good music if it wacked them over the head. However I can vagely see where there coming from though. If Im honest the first time I heard it I found it a bit long and boring. But listen to it more and you'll find it amazing. Every single track on this album is great. From the nice slow paced breath to the fast instrumentl On the run to the hard rocker time. My faviroute track on this album is either money or us and them. DONT listen to people like jacdale 8 or whatever hes called hes into crap like Fall out boy. Pink Floyd put all of them to shame and if you havent seen them at live 8 yet WATCH THEM! theyve still got it!
B0000029GA|5.0|I tell myself things.  Things like \\"I really like Power in Numbers by Jurassic 5\\".  And I believe it most of the time...that album is great.  But for some reason, it hardly gets any play.  Once I put that album in, it's a great listen, I don't hit the skip button, etc.  But it rarely finds the cd player, I don't feel compelled to put it in.  Same with a lot of supposedly \\"great\\" albums like Mos Def's Black on Both Sides and Talib Kweli's Reflection Eternal and Common's Resurrection.  Great albums, your collection is not complete without them, but when I'm flipping through my cd book, it doesn't call out to me.  I don't have the urge to play them most of the time.<br /><br />This is my first rap review.  A lot of people like Illmatic.  It's on everybody's top 5 hip hop albums of all time list.  I never bothered to review because I figured everything has been said already about this album.  You don't need me to tell you this is great, just read the other reviews.  But man, when I'm flipping through my cd's, I always, always pause at Illmatic.  It's always saying to me \\"Play me, bump me, nod your head to me\\".  No other rap album does this, and I have a lot of them.  It's ridiculous to me when I think about how much better this album is than anything else.  Someone can ask me...top 5 hip hop albums of all time, and I'll answer, instantly...Tribe, Wu, Pharcyde, Handsome Boy, and Nas.  But it's ridiculous...yeah, those are my top 5, and if all the albums gets 5 stars, Illmatic would need about 8.  I guess what I'm trying to say is...yes, Illmatic top 5 material, it's probably number 1.  But it's number 1 by a lot, a lot.  It just blows everything else out of the water, and the things it's blowing out (Tribe, Wu), they are sooooo quality that it hurts your mind that one album is so above the rest of the competition.  I guess Illmatic is like Jordan, or Tiger in their prime.  Yes, they are good.  Yes, they are the best in their sport.  But what you need to understand is...being the best doesn't always tell it all.  It's the best by soooo far that it's mind numbing.  That's illmatic.the best doesn't always tell it all.  It's the best by soooo far that it's mind numbing.  That's illmatic.
B000002UAU|5.0|As the 1960s started to reach its mid-to-late point, Beatle-mania started to die down. The Beatles were still the biggest, most-talented, critically acclaimed band in the world, but the teen idol adulation may not have been as strong as a few years prior. Not wanting to be outshone by rivals, and wanting to explore different types of music and expand their horizon, the Beatles started experimenting after their folk period of the mid 60s (\\"Rubber Soul,\\" 1965). \\"Revolver,\\" (1966) with such songs as \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" saw the Beatles scope broaden considerably, with far more complex compositions and intricate layers of musical arraignments. But as much of an accomplishment \\"Revolver\\" was, it was the follow-up album \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" (1967) that saw the Beatles, with the help of producer George Martin reach their full artistic vision.<br /><br />\\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is undoubtedly one of the most influential and greatest masterpieces in not only rock n' roll, but in music history. Its use of the Dolby Noise Reduction System, which reduces the buildup of sound during overdubbing was groundbreaking and set the standard for other recording artists. With its vast array of innovative arraignments and studio techniques; a clarinet ensemble, sitar, Mellotron, \\"flanging\\", and phasing, \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" set the standard for what could be accomplished in the studio. (Source: Wikipedia).<br /><br />\\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is in many ways the first concept album. The theme of the album is that that Beatles play four characters, the band leader being \\"Billy Shears\\" (Ringo Starr). Lennon, however, was adamant that his songs had nothing to do with the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" concept. While the album's first two songs are based on a theme, the concept idea was later abandoned (Source: Wikipedia). Still, the way the album flows seamlessly along like a dream can warrant the album being labeled a \\"concept album.\\"<br /><br />Most of my favorite albums have one or two \\"filler\\" songs on them. Songs that either are weak or, at best, aren't that great. On that rare instance that every song is quite strong, there are still going to be ones that I like better than others. With \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" however, there are no highs and lows in terms of quality. Every song is just as good as the one that came before it. I have listened to \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" since as long as I can remember, and after 20 odd years, I never tire of hearing it. Listening to this album is not like listening to most other albums, to hear \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is an experience.<br /><br />The opening title track \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" with its mock audience, French horn quartet, McCartney's urgent delivery in the verse, Lennon's lush melodic chorus, with Harrison's signature solos are the Beatles at their absolute best. The album comes back to earth with the morose but optimistic \\"With a Little Help from my Friends\\" a song that always picks up my mood no matter how I'm feeling.<br /><br />Perhaps Lennon's finest composition, \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" is the archetypical acid-rock song that set the standard. Perhaps no other song in rock or pop history possesses such rich imagery.<br /><br />The following trio is pure McCartney; \\"Getting Better\\" takes the listener back to earth with an optimistic outlook on life, the pondering \\"Fixing a Hole\\" is somewhat abstract, and the album shows real humanity with its tale of aging and being forgotten with the tragic \\"She's leaving Home.\\"<br /><br />The lyrics for \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" were taken from a poster Lennon spotted at a circus. The lyrics sound as though they were tailor-made made for the carnival, freakish composition the Beatles composed. \\"Within You, Without You\\" has at times been criticized as a weak link on \\"Sgt. Pepper;\\" a criticism which is unwarranted. This Eastern-religious flavored epic addressing fundamental questions concerning the meaning of life is one of Harrison's most memorable songs. Surrounded by two of the greatest songwriters of the twentieth century, George Harrison has never been given proper credit.<br /><br />\\"When I'm sixty-four\\" is the yin to the yang of \\"She's Leaving Home.\\" While the former deals with aging and having lost meaning after the empty nest, the latter deals with the golden years of a couple growing old together. The meaning of the cheeky \\"Lovely Rita\\" is rather obscure, but the song shows McCartney's pop-craft mastery at its best. \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" is pure Lennon, with one highlight being a kick-ass solo, courtesy of Harrison. \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" (reprise) is the perfect way to wind the album down before the epic \\"A Day in the Life.\\"<br /><br />While most Beatles songs are credited Lennon/McCartney, truth be told, most of the band's mid and later work was written either by one or the other. Showcasing the pop-craftsmanship of McCartney (although Lennon was also gifted in this foray) and the psychedelic avant-garde trimming of Lennon, \\"A Day in the Life\\" is equal parts both Lennon and McCartney. Often cited as the greatest rock and/or pop song of all-time, it's hard to argue against such a claim.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that as of this writing \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is almost forty years old. Truly unparalleled in its creativity, song-writing, and influence, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is arguably the greatest rock album ever created.life is one of Harrison's most memorable songs.

B00005JOM9|4.0|From the moment we first see Bree Osborne (Felicity Huffman, TV's \\"Desperate Housewives\\"), a pre-op Transgender patient, it is difficult to recognize the well-known actress. Occasionally, an actor will so completely take on the role they are playing it becomes difficult to spot them, to remember we are not watching an actor play a role. Often when this happens, the actor has gone on to win an Academy Award. Huffman does this with Bree Osborne in \\"Transamerica\\". If she doesn't win the Oscar, she will be robbed.<br /><br />Bree has slowly and deliberately completed all of the necessary requirements to receive the surgery she so desperately wants. The surgery which will finally remove all traces of her former self, of Stanley, and help her finally live the life she has always dreamed of. Her psychiatrist (Elizabeth Pena) has guided her through the process, helping her, preparing her, making sure she is ready for the final step. And both are very happy when Bree has reached the final step. But then she receives a call from New York informing her that Stanley's son is in jail. She talks to her psychiatrist about this and learns she must travel to New York and help the son she never knew she had, her former self had, before she can have the surgery. Heartbroken, she realizes this is just the latest hurdle on the long journey. Upon her arrival in New York, she bails Toby (Kevin Zegers) out and realizes he is living in squalor, as a prostitute. She poses as a missionary from a church and agrees to give him a ride to Los Angeles. Along the way, they learn a lot about each other, making them stronger, better people.<br /><br />\\"Transamerica\\" is a good film featuring a great performance by Huffman. The film's roots and production values are very evident, giving the finished product a grainy, low-budget look, ultimately detracting from the film. But only slightly.<br /><br />Felicity Huffman's transformation is amazing. Much like Dustin Hoffman in \\"Tootsie\\", the two actors successfully become their characters in both appearance and manner. Huffman does a better job, simply because she is more successful in satisfying both the appearance and mannerisms of her character. In \\"Tootsie\\", we bought into Hoffman's portrayal of Dorothy Michaels, because it was funny and it fit. No one in their right mind would ever believe she is a real woman. But because the acting was so good, and the film was so funny, we went along for the ride. In \\"Transamerica\\", Huffman looks remarkably similar to Hoffman in the comedy, but the key difference is that Bree is a pre-op transsexual and the film is more dramatic. She isn't a woman. Yet. We can believe her very mannish appearance because of the stage of her transformation.<br /><br />Huffman does a remarkable job of becoming a very masculine looking woman, a masculine looking woman who wants to appear feminine. Huffman is a great actress and very good looking, but she isn't a beauty, in the traditional Hollywood sense. If she were, the role would have been difficult to pull off. The role embraces Huffman's unique looks, allowing her to become all the more convincing as she plays the role.<br /><br />Huffman also captures the right amount of exaggerated femininity for the role. As Bree is trying to become a woman, many aspects of her character are learned through observation and practice. Every piece of clothing Bree wears is very feminine, too feminine, and tightly coordinated with every other piece. The result? She looks like a Mary Kay Salesman, wearing pink skirts and matching coats with bright scarves around her neck. As Bree is, essentially, playing a part, she occasionally slips and \\"let's down her guard\\". The few times this happens, we see further skill of Huffman's ability and realize Bree has been working on the process for a long time. Her mannerisms are just right, making her appear like a man trying to be a woman, always moving her hands, trying to be delicate, demure and very feminine. Because Breetries so hard, she gives herself away but we get a sense that her surgery will make everything right again, when she can acclimate, everything will fall into place.<br /><br />If the performance were simply about becoming the character, it would be good, but because Bree lives a believable life, the performance becomes great. During the first act, we witness Bree's life and learn of how she has adapted her life. Living in a small cottage in a largely Latino neighborhood, she waits for the bus with other workers. Standing next to a man, Bree realizes she is too tall and bends her knees a little, until she is lower than him. We watch Bree at her job as a bus boy, with her psychiatrist, in her neighborhood. But something we don't really realize, until later in the film, is how isolated her life is. No significant other, no friends, no family. This is part of the reason her psychiatrist postpones her surgery until she deals with the discovery of her son. The psychiatrist won't let her blow off his problems, or postpone meeting him until after the surgery. It is painful for Bree, but she does it, always hoping to successfully navigate the new hurdle in time for her to keep her scheduled surgery.<br /><br />Upon her arrival in New York, she meets Toby (Zegers), and bails him out. When she sees his living conditions, that he is living in squalor, and working as a prostitute, she can't simply leave him there. She has to help. Initially, she decides to reunite him with his step-dad, something he doesn't seem very eager for.<br /><br />Kevin Zegers is very good. Toby is a fairly typical character; into drugs, aimless, trying to survive, he sells his body for money. At first, the character doesn't seem like it will offer anything new, and for a long time, this appears to be the case. But then we realize he is just as isolated as Bree. Throughout the film, we watch him form a friendship, a bond, with his new found friend.<br /><br />\\"Transamerica\\" ultimately becomes a road picture and this is not my favorite type of film. Road pictures just seem like easy, manipulative ways to get two or three characters to learn about each other, for the benefit of the audience. But in the case of \\"Transamerica\\", the two characters are so believable, and so interesting, that I was willing to overlook the inevitable scene in which they have to campout, or visit a back roads diner, or a small gas station. The road trip aspect of the film is very predictable and also very low-budget. The filmmakers obviously don't have to pay a lot to film in the wilderness, at a low-budget motel, or on the back roads of Kentucky.<br /><br />From the road picture scenario to the grainy look of the film, \\"Transamerica\\" is a low-budget film. And it works. But why can't a major studio spend some money on a project like this? Perhaps with the success of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" and the positive reviews for Huffman in this film, studios will be more willing to make films exploring challenging themes like these. Not every film about gay people or people with challenging needs has to look like it was made with a couple of hand held cameras and a bootleg copy of AVID on someone's home computer.<br /><br />I was also impressed with the resolution of \\"Transamerica\\". The film ends on a realistic note, the characters are happy with some of their accomplishments and unhappy with other aspects of their lives. They don't ride off into the sunset, happy as clams. Given the backgrounds of the characters, their problems, their secrets, their previous lives, this seems entirely realistic. If the characters resolved everything well and lived happily ever after, the film would end on a false note, changing our view of the project. We get the sense that Bree and her son will have to get to know each other some more, after we have gone home, in private.ause Bree tries so hard, she gives herself away but we get a sense that her surgery will make everything right again, when she can acclimate, everything will fall into place. <br /> <br />If the performance were simply about becoming the character, it would be good, but because Bree lives a believable life, the performance becomes great.

B00005JNTX|1.0|Seriously, this movie sucks so bad, there should be some kind of reverse Academy Award for it.  I don't understand why Bruce Willis agreed to be in this steamy turd of a movie, because he is a good actor and he's been in some really good movies.  But this movie is dumb, and it's so violent that it's ridiculous.  And the directors seem to be unable to decide if they want to make a live action movie, or an animated movie, so what you get is a weird combination  of both.  It was ridiculous how the characters in the movie were so hard to kill, especially Marv (Mickey Rourke).  And the movie had cannibalism in it, and people being hacked up with saws.  And Nick Stahl's character had his sex organs shot off, then surgically replaced, then ripped off again.  And Nick Stahl had become this ridiculous-looking yellow man with a round, bald head and yellow skin.  It was so stupid!
B000C65Z1G|1.0|This was a horribly boring movie that I only finished watching because I kept telling myself it had to get better.I was wrong-it didn't. THis movie is long slow and boring. Also, the jerky camera movements used to simulate hand held camera work are a tired and overused cinamatographical tool. The plot was  the same old liberal tripe about the Evil Drug Companies. After watching this movie i really began to understand how out of touch hollywood is with the rest of the world. This movie is a total crock.Only watch this movie if you're trying to kill yourself through boredom.
0783225849|5.0|ONE OF HITCHCOCK's BEST and my personal faviort.  No one in the history of motion pictures can forget the riveting performance of Anthony Perkins as the leering Norman Bates. A Oscar calibrated perforance for which he was overlooked. Burt Lancaster took it that year for ELMER GANTRY (another good film).  Hitchcock was over looked for a best diriction nod as well. Janet Leigh did get a best supporting nod as the nervous and scheming Marion Crane, although she herself lost to Shirley Jones that year for her unforgetable performace in ELMER GANTRY. <br />I do not think Hollywood will ever see another Norman Bates or another Anthony Perkins, oddly enough Perkins was nominated again in 1956 for Friendly Persurasion, for a supporting role.  That year it went to Anthony Quinn in a big upset for his performance in Lust for Life for which he only had actually ten mintutes of dialog.

Better than any of the songs on American Idiot Someone needs to introduce me to Billie Joe Armstrong because he is one of the greatest rockers of all time.

How can somebody take such rich source material and spin it into something so wretched it makes 'Attack of the Crab Monsters' look like a Val Lewton production? Hideous pacing (well, nonexistent really), terrible direction, unconnvincing CGI, abominable writing, wooden acting and probably the worst Frankenstein Monster and Dracula designs since the Al Adams days. It is a crime this thing got made, a crime Sommers was paid for it and a crime that a serious revamp of the Universal classics has been torpedoed by this idiocy. <br /> <br />Wish there was a 'zero' rating, because one star is too much for this sludge.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|The Exorcism of Emily Rose (Scott Derrickson, 2005)<br /><br />There are some movies that, when I see them for the first time, simply blow me away. There are some movies that don't really have much of an effect when I'm watching them, but that creep me out later, upon reflection. There are very, very few films that both blow me away and creep me out later for thoroughly different reasons. In fact, I can only think of one-- the original Candyman (which got me when I watched it for the final scene, and kept me awake nights for weeks afterwards because of the Oscar-worthy sound effects editing in the parking garage scene)-- that did it to me before I saw The Exorcism of Emily Rose.<br /><br />This is a \\"wow\\" movie-- one that, if I were writing reviews for the local paper, would get simply that word as a review. It is a fantastic movie from beginning to end, with its positives far outweighing its negatives. If you ignore the rest of the review, here's all you need to know: see this movie.<br /><br />I heard a pundit, back when it originally came out, refer to this movie as \\"Law and Order with demons.\\" To an extent, that's true; the movie centers not around Emily Rose (White Chicks' Jennifer Carpenter) herself, who is already dead as the film opens, but around Erin Bruner (Laura Linney of The Mothman Prophecies), an attorney for the law firm representing the diocese where the priest in the case, Father Moore (The Full Monty's Tom Wilkinson), attempted to exorcise Emily. Emily's story itself is told in flashbacks as Erin gets more of the story from Moore and others who knew her. (Okay, so maybe it's actually CSI with demons.)<br /><br />As with most horror films of this nature-- though in retrospect, it's hard to call The Exorcism of Emily Rose a horror film-- the real disturbance for the viewer is going to come in the subtle things. The changes in Emily's appearance as the story goes on are obvious, but there are subtleties that really kick the viewer in the teeth. You might not even notice them on a conscious level, but they're the things that make all the difference in making this look real. (The devil is in the details, indeed.) But behind the \\"we're out to give you nightmares\\" aspect lies excellent filmmaking; the camerawork, script, pacing, etc. are all wonderful. The acting is good, though no one turns in a truly great performance. That said, Linney is far, far, better here than she was in The Mothman Prophecies. Wilkinson, as always, is on his game (though the film's one major failing is that his attempt at a rural American accent is, at times, pathetic to the point of laughability). Colm Feore, as Erin's boss, has a small but wonderful part that makes the most of Feore's innate creepiness. The real pleasure here, though, is Carpenter, who finally gets a solid role with meat in it, and turns out to have quite the appetite.<br /><br />The final straw, of course, is that (unlike The Amityville Horror, whatever Andrew Douglas wants you to believe) The Exorcism of Emily Rose is based on a true story. (How closely based, I have no idea, as I have not yet tracked down The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel, the book on which this film is based; it's been out of print for a while, and to the best of my knowledge, has not yet been reissued. Odd, that.)<br /><br />Flirting with inclusion in my all-time-100-best list. Really, Tom Wilkinson's accent is its only stumbling block. **** ½h.

It left such a bad taste in my mouth it even made my milk duds sour.  Save your money and your time, your stomach will thank you. Don't make any dinner plans before you'll puke, and you sure will not want to go out to eat afterwards, not to mention what the movies says about overseas travel.
B000000W5H|5.0|I would give this 4.5 stars but have rounded up.  The last Stones album to feature Mick Taylor and the first one to be produced by Jagger and Richards under their pseudoname 'The Glimmer Twins'. <br /> <br />ITS ONLY ROCK N ROLL is not as good as 'STICKY FINGERS' or 'EXILE ON MAIN STREET' but much better than the previous 'GOATS HEAD SOUP' in which the group sounded drained of energy and is a much better album than is given credit. <br /> <br />Some really good tracks on the first half - the title track, the opening 'If You Can't Rock Me', 'Til the Next Goodbye' and 'Time Waits for Noone', although long, has got one of Mick Taylor's best guitar solos. Side two unfortunately features some filler; 'Dance Little Sister' is overly repetitive, as is 'Short and Curlies', although the latter is quite amusing.  'Luxury' is a strong stab at reggae and the closing 'Fingerprint File' is excellent. <br /> <br />Enough good stuff to ensure that it remains a permanent fixture in my collection.  Only recently upgraded from the vinyl to the remastered CD which enhances the sound quality.  This and 'SOME GIRLS' are easily the best Stones albums post 'Exile on Main Street'.  The others are fairly average.  'Its Only Rock N Roll' is well worth considering.
0307276902|1.0|As I came across this new title based on a middle class man's descend into a drug and alcohol laced hell, I couldn't help but compare it to a friend of mine.  It was almost eerily similar descriptions in the book that were just like the experiences that my friend had had in his life.  He to had lived in a middle-class household and had parents that sent him off to rehab, in fact more than once.  He spent more than three months in prison due to acts of theft for the sake of having crack, and a DUI.  Not to mention being violent and abusive and totally unable to maintain a normal relationship.  He once ended up face down in the gutter drunk in a pile of blood with his wrists slit; another on his front lawn convulsing from an overdose of anti-depressants in a suicide attempt.  I was going to buy this book for him so that he could see someone else that had been as low as him and in fact had managed to get it together.  Then I find out that James Frey had fabricated many things he claimed to have been experienced.  There is no honor in this book and he has managed to disgrace himself in a way that no drug addiction could ever do.  People like my friend sit in a horrible position with an amazing story to tell and get overlooked by the likes of someone that tells 'A Million Little Lies' in order to get published.  Those with an addiction such as my friend now have no reason or ability to try and relate to James Frey and find strength through his words.  Those of us that have real stories of such turmoil should be heard and it is an insult to all of us that have been and are still in such a bad place in life.  What a slap in the face.  Perhaps James Frey should stick to writing Hollywood screenplays where embellishment is a requirement.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|Oldboy (Chanwook Park, 2003)<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but I was expecting Oldboy to be a far more violent movie than it actually is; those of you who got the same impression and haven't yet seen it, be aware that while it's a very odd film-- very odd indeed-- if you go in expecting Ichi the Killer, you're going to be disappointed on some level.<br /><br />We open seeing Oh Dae-Su (Sympathy for Lady Vengeance's Min-Sik Choi) drunk in a police station. (Watching the DVD's sole deleted scene, an extended version of this opening scene, will both help it make a lot more sense and give you a strong appreciation for the editor's job.) His best friend, Cheol-woon (Dal-su Oh, also in Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) comes to get him, and they stop at a pay phone on the way so Oh Dae-Su can call his wife and daughter (whose birthday it is) to let them know he's on his way home; as his friend wishes Oh Dae-Su's daughter a happy birthday, Oh Dae-Su vanishes. (I'm being a bit more expository here than usual, because it took me about thirty minutes to understand how the opening scenes connected to the rest of the film.) Oh Dae-Su wakes up in a prison-- though it's not by any means a normal prison-- and there's an extended scene about his day-to-day life there, during which he slowly goes insane. Fifteen years after he is first imprisoned, he gets out, vowing revenge on those who imprisoned him-- as soon as he can figure out why they did it. Think Kafka, but with more claw hammers and less existentialism.<br /><br />The best thing about Asian mysteries, aside from the obvious fact (obvious, anyway, to those who watch them) that unlike Hollywood, the Asians assume their audiences have a modicum of intelligence, is that Asian mysteries are usually surprising when the big reveal comes about. I don't know whether this is a function of me being an American watching them; perhaps, if I'd grown up in the culture, I'd watch Oxide Pang, Chanwook Park, and Kyoshi Kurosawa films and be as depressed as I am attempting to watch J. S. Cardone films as an American. I don't think so, though; the simple fact is that Park, who also wrote the screenplay, has come up with a truly twisted mystery, with layer upon layer of surprises just waiting to jump up and punch the viewer in the face. It's not handled in amateur fashion, either; it's one of those situations where you never quite get used to the punches, because each one is just that much harder than the last. And Park varies the delivery methods, as well (the infamous clawhammer scene is so out of place in the early stages of the film that it comes as a shock, but still doesn't feel as if it's actually out of place thanks to Oh Dae-Su's internal monologues. That's good filmmaking right there), so the movie is, while not a continual revelation, a constant guessing-game. It's not only the plot that will keep you watching.<br /><br />I should probably warn you that if you've got a weak stomach for things that normally gross people out, the big reveal in this flick (and Oh Dae-Su's wonderful reaction to it in the film's final scenes) is probably going to give you the weirds. But then I get the feeling that was Park's intention. Me, I was just impressed that Park had done such a great job of setting it up, and I'd completely missed it. This is really fun stuff. ****as depressed as I am attempting to watch J. S. Cardone films as an American.

B00005JOFO|4.0|BUT i think it would have worked just as well with a hetrosexial relationship. The emotional tyranny between both Ennis and Jack denying thier feeling for one another an then suddenly comming to terms with it after it is to late is projected with empathy to the movie goer but I think it would have worked just as well with a male and female leasion.  Although, Ang Lee's diriction was good it was better demonstrated in films such as Eat Drink Man Woman and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
B000000W5F|4.0|4 stars, could possibly get 4.5... <br /> <br />Although the 11 tracks were all leftovers from previous sessions, TATTOO YOU is the best of the Rolling Stones albums that they put out in the 1980s, and its also the last decent Stones album.   <br /> <br />It starts on an excellent note with 'Start Me Up' (the last great single the group released, and also ends on an excellent note with 'Waiting on a Friend'.  The original vinyl could be classified into a rock n' roll side (side one) and a ballad side (side two).  The first side starts off well but runs out of steam towards the end with 'Neighbours', but the other 5 tracks are mostly decent, and 'Slave' is superb.  The ballad side suffers from a couple of weak tracks, most notably 'Heaven' and 'No Use in Crying' but the rest is good.   <br /> <br />Apart from the above mentioned three tracks this is a good Stones album overall.  (That said the weaker tracks aren't so bad that they need to be skipped).  The digitally remastered cd provides enhanced sound quality. While not their best and nowhere near the the likes of 'Sticky Fingers' or 'Exile on Main Street', it equals or perhaps betters 'Some Girls', and is also much better than its predecessor 'Emotional Rescue' and also the later albums that followed (starting with 'Undercover'). <br />
B00006879E|1.0|Terrible.  How can a band with so little talent and a singer with such a poor, poor voice become so popular?  It's always stunning when you realize how dumb some music \\"fans\\" are.  This band is awful.
B000C65Z1G|3.0|The Constant Gardener (Ferdinand Meirelles, 2005)<br /><br />Meirelles, who stunned the world a few years back with Cidade de Deus, once again shows that great foreign directors imported to America turn out less than stellar movies when off their home turf. (Look at Guillermo del Toro, who makes great movies when he goes south of the border, but then comes up here and makes things like Blade II.) to be fair, he wasn't working with the world's best source material, but the very fact of Cidade de Deus' existence shows that Meirelles does know how to handle ham-handed social-consciousness junk with considerable aplomb; here, unfortunately, none of that aplomb is in evidence.<br /><br />Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a British diplomat in Africa, learns early on in the film that his wife Tessa (Enemy at the Gates' Rachel Weisz) and her driver have been found on the road back from a weekend trip she'd spent up north with a friend of the family. From this central point, we gradually get both the stories of how we got here (starting with Justin meeting Tessa) and where we're going from here (Justin trying to dig up exactly what it was Tessa was actually doing, and how he handles his conflicting opinions about it). It's impossible to go into without spoilers, but let's just say that \\"what it was Tessa was actually doing\\" is thinly-disguised (when it's even disguised) attempts to rouse the viewer into some sort of righteous anger, and social activism dolled up as art is almost impossible to do in any way that makes it still resemble art. When done correctly (as it was in Cidade de Deus), it requires the message never getting in the way of the story, and it also, pretty much by definition, requires a level of ambiguity; The Constant Gardener has neither of these qualities on a consistent basis.<br /><br />When the movie's on, it's pretty firmly on; Weisz is a good actress when the script doesn't have her spouting naïve homily, and there's a decent complement of thinking-man's action film stuff (by \\"thinking man's action film,\\" I mean that stuff doesn't blow up nearly as much as you think it should, but there are still many of the hallmarks of a spy thriller; think of the first Mission: Impossible flick). Unfortunately, it likes to swerve off the track a good deal, and could easily have been half an hour shorter.<br /><br />Not bad; a pleasant way to kill two hours. But certainly could have been a lot better. ** ½-man's action film stuff (by \\"thinking man's action film,\\" I mean that stuff doesn't blow up nearly as much as you think it should, but there are still many of the hallmarks of a spy thriller; think of the first Mission: Impossible flick).

0375703764|1.0|This book is a grossly over-rated piece of unreadable literary masturbation. It's similar to Joyce's 'Finnegan's Wake'--self-indulgent, cryptic scrawls and references lacking in true poetry but designed to keep an otherwise unemployable group of English professors, 'literary theorists' and critics working. It is meticulously designed, researched and written, lacking in soul and substance.<br /><br />If you enjoy puzzles and frequently pat yourself on the back for your depth of classical or literary knowledge, you'll enjoy this book. If you're a pompous ass, you'll absolutely love this book.<br /><br />If you're a relatively normal person who enjoys a good read, on the other hand, this book is a complete waste of time.
0743455967|4.0|I highly recommend Stephen King's book, On Writing; one of only two of his books I've bought, and the only non-fiction of the 22 of his works I've read since 1976.  <br /> <br />King has a bench slot in a roster of authors (including Elmore Leonard, Amy Tan, Gloria Naylor, the late Trevanian, Sue Grafton, and Robert Tanenbaum) whose new releases I pick up if I see them at the library. I'm not a horror fan, and King is the only writer of that genre that I'll read. There is a magnetic familiarity that draws me to him, but it wasn't until after reading On Writing that I completely understood the attraction. The first section of the book is a brief autobiography that leaves you wanting much, much more. <br /> <br />What's not to love about Stephen King? He's a baseball fan, he plays guitar with a rock band comprised of other famous writers, he's a recovering alcoholic and addict, he grew up dirt poor without a dad, he's been married to the same woman for over 30 years, he's a philanthropist, and, most important, he makes me laugh out loud.  <br /> <br />Heeding King's advice on the craft, I have rewritten the above two paragraphs four times. You may wonder how they scanned before I rewrote them, but I don't remember. That's the beauty of the backspace key: perfect amnesia. I know for certain I removed all the adverbs. <br /> <br />Besides offering a bestselling author's opinion on style, grammar, structure and plot, On Writing answers some of the questions King has been asked thousands of times by interviewers and fans, such as how he gets his ideas (\\"situations\\"), how he maintains his work ethic, what he thinks of the publishing business, what are his underlying themes, how autobiographical are his characters, and what constitutes \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" writing. The book mainly deals with fiction writing, but his instructions can be applied to any type of storytelling, even blogging. <br /> <br />Despite my substantial investment of time over the years reading King's work, Inever researched his background or kept track of his press. Since reading On Writing, I've become extremely curious about all things King and have been scouring the Net for information. I read all about the 1999 hit-and-run accident that nearly killed him, his other television and movie projects, and the reviews of his newest novel, Cell, that I definitely intend to read. <br /> <br />On Writing made me want to know more about Stephen King. It made me understand why books I would ordinarily eschew were irresistable to me. It made me want to read more of his work, possibly the Dark Tower saga; and it inspired me to try my hand at fiction. Considering that King wrote most of this book somewhat reluctantly while recovering from his injuries, it still had a pretty big impact on me. Except, I can't kill all the adverbs. (Inside joke - read the book!) <br />
0553208845|3.0|Hess's Siddhartha is well-known as a book that changes people's lives, setting them down a path to enlightenment and religion, just like the book's title character. However, what I garnered from the tale of a young Brahmin's travels through India in an attempt to unravel what life really means is that the book had nothing to say to really help one through life.<br /><br />The story is simple and meditative and none of the philosophy is impossible to decipher and understand. It's all very Zen-like and non-confrontational. The main point of the book, however, is to not let anyone tell you how to live your life. Everything Siddhartha does in the book is a product of rejecting any advice anyone gives him. He walks his path alone, not allowing anything to cloud it with their input and ultimately that works out for him. The book seems to be preaching that one should never, under any circumstances, be preached to.<br /><br />It's a short book and no chore to read, and perhaps I just don't see the real point. Maybe my path is just too clouded for me to understand. Or, it could be that I'm so enlightened that I didn't let this book tell me what to do and I passed the test. Whatever it was that caused me to not connect with this book, however, shouldn't stop anyone else from picking it up and seeing if it affects them in a more profound way, as it seems to have done to everyone else whom has written a review here. It's a simple novel and an okay read, so give it a shot.

B00005JO04|1.0|I saw \\"Syriana\\" yesterday. I must say that the movie was awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />For me, it doesn't even deserve a star. <br />By comparing it to the novels of an author I don't like (Tom Clancy), I mean there are just too many characters in the movie. You don't know who is whom, what they're doing, etc. <br />I just sat there in the movie theather and asked myself, \\"What the hell am I watching?\\" <br />There are a lot of unanswered questions. Like, for example: why did Matt Damon and Amanda Peet's son die in the swimming pool? <br />Who had broken into Christopher Plummer's house? And even worse, what the hell is William Hurt doing in this movie??? <br />You see him talking to George Clooney for about ten seconds, then he completely disappears from the movie? Who was he and what role did he play??? <br />I don't even know what the movie is about. <br />And I think Roger Ebert is a complete a-hole for giving this movie an A. What the hell is wrong with that guy? He's old and he needs to retire.  <br />The worse thing about \\"Syriana\\" for me were all the scenes with the Arabs in it. Why? Because they speak their own language without there being English subtitles!!! When somebody watches these scenes (every scene is approximately 10 minutes long), of course they ask, \\"What the hell are they saying?\\" <br /> <br />As for George Clooney, I think he's a great actor and I have absolutely nothing against him, but he didn't deserve to be nominated nor win a Golden Globe for Best Supporting actor. <br />His perfomance wasn't even close to being intense. I think the reason they nominated him was because they had no other actor in a supporting category to nominate. <br />What about other actors who were not only snubbed for a Golden Globe, but also an Academy Award? <br />I'm talking about Sandra Bullock and Thandie Newton in Crash and Eric Bana in Munich. <br /> <br />Overall, I would definetly not recommend this movie to anybody, not even to rent the DVD when it comes out. <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I will preface this review by saying that I am in no way a Joss Whedon fan. I hated Buffy and Angel. I think the show Firefly is fantastic if a bit overrated. Know then that when I say this movie is spectacular it is untainted by bias.<br /><br />This movie is SPECTACULAR. I think that everyone involved did a remarkable job in making this both a respectable extension of the television show and an entertaining standalone action movie. They both wrapped up the River Tamm storyline neatly and left breathing room for a possible sequel(s), whatever form that might take at this point.<br /><br />The dialogue is fresh and believable, the acting is inspired, the characters are as fans will tell you memorable, and the effects are awesome. Let's face it though, Joss Whedon's hallmark is coming up with a clever idea, memorable characters and letting the characters and dialog move the show. So what about the plot? Well at least he was smart enough to know his one weakness and steal from one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time-Forbidden Planet. Which is forgivable since Forbidden Planet stole from Shakespear.<br /><br />So I guess that makes Serenity Shakespearian! Cool. Well, at any rate, it's probably the best most original sci-fi movie we'll see for some time.
0307276902|5.0|Despite the current controversy over the truth of James Frey's A Million Little Pieces, the story has such a \\"real\\" feeling to it that I honestly did not care whether all the events and people were 100% accurate.  Speaking as a first person narrator, Frey allows the reader to share his thoughts, feelings, struggles, and pain.  His repetition and scattered flashbacks make the book seem like Frey's mind was spilled out onto each page.  I felt as if I too was having to endure the torture of detoxification, though I have never had experiences with drugs or alcohol that could even come close to Frey's.   <br /> From the very beginning, I couldn't put the book down.  It is so gripping and it pulls you into Frey's tale.  During his time in the Minnesota institution, he meets and builds relationships with memorable characters that feel so true; the author's uses of both direct and indirect characterization make the characters each character perfectly flawed for the story.  His detailed descriptions of the emotional and physical challenges he faces are sometimes difficult to read, but still irresistible.  One of the most memorable events in the book involves a visit to the dentist's office.  The horrible, gut wrenching pain of multiple dental surgery procedures without any type of anesthesia made me cringe, but like all of Frey's other struggles, it made me want to continue reading so that I could see James succeed.  A Million Little Pieces is nothing short of riveting, from its beginning to its bittersweet end. <br />
0553801503|5.0|**WARNING** POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, <br /> <br />At this point, I'm more than willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt; his previous installments of this glorious saga were sensational, but after a series of major battles, there comes a hiatus. This book embodies that stunned pause, describing it from personal, political, and geographical points of view. <br />\\"Mopping up\\" operations are taking place all over this world...Riverun falls, as does Storms End.  Outlaws and broken men are being rounded up and destroyed.  Power vacuums are recognized and the struggles begin to fill them. <br />\\"A Feast of Crows\\" indeed!  After the deaths of so many major characters - movers and shakers in this world - heretofore minor characters should be expected to squabble over what is left - and some of them reveal themselves as crows, unable to wisely wield the power they now possess.  Others, like Brienne, seize one thing that might enable them to maintain their sanity in a world gone mad (her vow to find the Stark daughters) and carry on. <br />Martin has used this book to position characters where he will need them later:  Does anyone doubt that the tall monk with the limp seen on the island is Sandor Clegane?  Does anyone doubt that his monstrous brother is still alive and more monstrous than ever?  Does anyone doubt that Brienne (and her sword) still has an important part to play?  Does anyone doubt that the \\"beautiful young queen\\" who is prophesied to supplant Cersei is Daenarys?  Does anyone doubt that the political and spiritual vacuum now being filled by the sparrows will result in inquisition and disaster?  Don't we all suspect that Jon Snow is not the son, but the nephew of Eddard Stark and the son of the late Targeryn prince?  Will the Blackfish head for the Wall?  Will Arya become like her wolf, a killer whose only purpose is to rid the world of poisonous Freys?  Now that Dorne's Lord, Euron crows-Eye, and the Citadel have all declared their intent to bring Dany and her dragons to Westeros, who will win her?  Which of them knows how to control and train the dragons? (\\"A dragon has three heads.\\") <br />This book may deal with mostly \\"minor\\" characters, but it perfectly and accurately reflects the feast of crows that is the aftermath of battle, it moves the story forward, it hints at the answers to questions raised in the previous books, and it explains why these characters are where they are, knowing what they know.  Anyone who thinks this book is a waste of time just doesn't appreciate a large tapestry. <br />
B00005JO9J|5.0|I walked into my living room, sat down, and turned on the tv. I had seen adverts for the show and they looked interesting. But quite by accident did i catch the first episode. <br />Hello addiction. <br />I used to watch ER on occasion and thought that it was a really good show. But with \\"Grey's\\" i literally didn't want to miss an episode. I found myself setting a time slot in my day to watch it that i missed maybe twice but always caught up with on another day. <br />Understand that i have a very busy schedule which is why i watch DVDs alot - i can watch them whenever. But during the week, if i watch any tv it's hap-hazard. This, however, i refused to miss. <br />FUNNY, SHOCKING, EXCITING, HEART-RACING.  <br />This show works so well because its so realistic, so human and you relate so much to the characters - they're learning, they're making mistakes and living life where they have to soldier on because they have responsibilities. <br />In 9 episodes it became (through ratings and polls) the most addictive TV show for years upon years. <br /> <br />And you may notice that ER was supposed to be finished. Done. Gone. For good. But 5 episodes into Grey's second series and ER mysteriously shows up again with a new series. And low and behold its ratings are actually down from their last recorded numbers. <br /> <br />NEW, FUN, EXCITING, INFURIATING, LOVEABLE, PULSE-POUNDING. Just some of the reasons that we all got hooked.  Watch it! Trust me, you don't, want to miss out.
B000000H64|5.0|Demanufacture is without a doubt the best fear factory albums I've ever listenened to. Many of the ignorant mallcore/wannabe-metalheads think this is death metal, while most of the experts know its not. Its Industrial Metal. If one was to take away the industrial essence of Fear Factory, let alone this album, it would be more of a thrash/groove sound, which I just got into. I am not going to say I'm an expert on metal, but I will say I know a lot more than mallcore kids. Fear Factory is one of my all-time favorite bands.  <br /> <br />The tracks that stand out the most are demanufacture and Replica, which Replica is one of my all time favorite songs. To everyone who loves metal, groove metal, industrial, this is the album that might start one off with.

Not only does this movie have style , but it also has some of the best action sequences in a vampire movie, as well as one of the best storylines, which is sometimes hard to find in a vampire movie. This movie looks just as sleek and sexy in mini form, as does Kate Beckinsale. So please, do yourself a favor and get this movie for your PSP. This may well be your favorite UMD, I know it's mine.

B000093BDX|5.0|I didn't take the time to look through all ninety reviews but I bet I'm one of the few, if not only, younger people that decided to pick up this album and not only listen to it, but review it. I'm 20 years old, was born in 1985 and I absolutely love classic music, especially from the 50's, 60's, and 70's. And I have to say.... this album was one of the best that I've picked up.<br /><br />I have to admit, I don't know much about the Beach Boys but when I heard \\"God Only Knows,\\" for the first time, I fell in love with them and had to get an album that would bring their best work to me. So one night, after work, I was wandering the Electronics section at Wal-Mart and picked up this CD randomly. And I was blown away at how good the Beach Boys really are... it seems that 'I Get Around,' 'California Girls,' and 'Little Deuce Coupe' dominate people's minds but they have so many better songs... like 'Don't Worry, Baby,' 'God Only Knows,' 'Good Vibrations,' and 'Wouldn't It Be Nice.' I love all the songs on the album but those are my favorites and I think they're the best I've heard so far. But then again, I should check out 'Pet Sounds' before I say anything else.<br /><br />This is a pretty crappy review, I know... but subject of it: I highly recommend this album to anyone my age who wants to immerse themselves in the best the 60's had to offer. That and the Beatles, of course.
B000000XB9|4.0|This is a pretty good CD. It's fun to listen to and has a nice range of songs from CCR. Of course, there are always a few different songs they could have included to make it better but hey, overall, it's a good buy.
0553213105|5.0|This book was truly a delight to read (and to re-read many times)! Jane Austen is a literary genius! \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a heartwarming tale with a beautifully woven plot, filled with witty dialogue and, of course, a charming love story. It is no wonder that this book has been so wildly successful!<br /><br />Reading over the negative reviews of this book, I am very surprised that anyone could not like this story! I certainly don't know what these people were thinking when they decided that they didn't like \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". This has certainly surpassed all other novels as my favorite book of all-time. Perhaps some might find Jane Austen's language difficult to understand, but as a 14-year-old, I didn't think that it was that way at all. This book will certainly remain dear to my heart forever, and I can certainly see myself reading it still 30 years from now.<br /><br />Elizabeth is a delightful heroine, and there is nothing quite as satisfying as the humbling of Mr. Darcy. I only wished that there was more (or that I was assigned to read it for my English class, which I would do with much pleasure)!<br /><br />In conclusion--read this book, for goodness sakes! You won't be sorry.

The tension is fantastic and the smoldering passion and chemistry between the two is awesome. This movie can be sometimes very funny, very sad, and smoldering in its tension and eroticism. Its not really a 'dirty' movie because it involves the subject of the Dom and Sub relationship. But its GOOOOOOOOOOD and BAAAAAAAAAAAD all in one. A one of a kind movie played excellently by Spader and Gyllenhaal.
6305781427|5.0|Wow!!! The only word that comes to my mind when I think about this concert. Its simply amazing. If you are trying to refine your musical taste, then here is the music which you should listen and watch. Violin, Cello,Bass, Percussion, Drums, all sorts of Wind instruments, synthesizer, Grand Piano,harpischord and what else would you need for an orchestra. I think nothing else. This music will elate your mind. Also listen to Yanni's words, he has some philosophical lessons for you. This is and will remain Yanni's best ever live concert. No doubt many people have called it a masterpiece.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I hope the English version of this comes out sometime in my lifetime. Until then, I have to watch the Japanese subtitled version.<br /><br />The movie is great. Anything lacking in Spirits Within is made up for in this movie. They had trouble making the characters in FFSW show emotion. There's plenty of emotion in Advent Children.<br /><br />The story is good but a little lacking. More dialog would have helped. There's a lot of fight scenes, which are great, but I would have liked to have seen more in between.<br /><br />Other than that, the movie is pure eye candy and it's too bad it has to end. Hopefully, the success of this movie will make Square want to make more of these movies.
0393317552|5.0|<br />    The Purist <br /> <br />    I give you now Professor Twist, <br />    A conscientious scientist, <br />    Trustees exclaimed, \\"He never bungles!\\" <br />    And sent him off to distant jungles. <br />    Camped on a tropic riverside, <br />    One day he missed his loving bride. <br />    She had, the guide informed him later, <br />    Been eaten by an alligator. <br />    Professor Twist could not but smile. <br />    \\"You mean,\\" he said, \\"a crocodile.\\" <br />That bit of Ogden Nash whimsy came into my head as I thought about Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel, a reflection on human history through the lens of evolutionary biology. Diamond, unlike Professor Twist, is seeking answers to real world problems. In this case, he seeks to understand the plight of indigenous peoples and their subordination to European and Asian cultures in light of evolutionary pressures. Even so, Diamond seems awkward in his attempts to justify the ways of the Blind Watchmaker to men as so. One false note comes early in the book, when he departs from his evenhandedness to assure us that not only should we not hold New Guineans to be less intellectually endowed than Europeans (a reasonable enough assumption), but that they are probably intellectually superior. He admits that he can't demonstrate that superiority empirically, so that assertion strikes the reader as an attempt to curry favor by a politically correct reverse bias. <br /> <br />On the other hand, there's a lot of really stimulating and interesting stuff in this book. Diamond talks about: what kinds of foodstuffs are necessary to support civilization; why disease almost always flowed from native Europeans to native Americans (and not vice-versa), whereas Europeans encounter many new diseases when they attempted to enter Africa; why those previous two topics are related; how innovation happens; etc. It seems like there's an interesting fact or point of view whenever you turn the page. <br /> <br />The book seeks a complete explanation for the course of human history. It has that sort of broad, sweeping intellectual appeal that a hefty work of philosophy or science has. For example, after someone learns Newtonian mechanics, he tends to see the entire universe as the interplay between physical forces that are expressed in terms of differential equations. A similar dynamic happens here, where the reader suddenly sees commonplaces in a new light. <br /> <br />As with most grand theories, it's important to see that there are some important limits to the analysis. While we can see why, in broad strokes, European and Asian peoples might have overwhelming advantages in human history in purely biological and geographical terms, Diamond's analysis is of no help in answering historical questions that still might strike us as large, but come within the realm of European or Asian culture, instead of at the border with other peoples. For example, it's hard to see how his analysis adds anything to our understand of conflicts such as the Greco-Persian wars, the rise and decline of Rome, the Napoleonic Wars, or the American Civil War. Certainly these questions are important, and we rightly inquire into agricultural, military, political, and culture causes for these events. In these cases Diamond's analysis is largely impossible, since we are dealing with peoples that share genetics, foodstuffs, climates, terrains, etc. <br /> <br />Perhaps I'm nit-picking. It's an excellent, thought-provoking book. I'd just like to temper the inevitable temptation to view all history through this lens.
0316172324|4.0|Have you ever wondered how you knew something without even thinking about it? Maybe you knew something was amiss or something was exactly how it should be. You might say \\"I have a feeling that this is...\\" but not be sure about where that feeling comes from. In Blink Malcolm Gladwell exposes some thinking behind this phenomenon. As with his previous book Tipping Point, Malcolm's writing is extremely readable and easy going. I `get the feeling' from reading his words that I would like him. He is smart, observant and descriptive.  <br />I give this book 9 out of 10 <br />I loved the writing and the content kept my attention through most of the book. The pace is mostly good. <br />To get a 10 I think there could have been some deeper probing into some of the ideas, by the end of the book I got frustrated with the repetition of some of the content.
B0002XNT0I|3.0|Firstly, this is NOT an AIDS film.  It's not a gay film.  It is first and foremost a courtroom drama.  That it uses AIDS as it's raison d'etre is irrelevant.  If you replaced AIDS with anything from sexual discrimination, to race or religion it would be pretty much the same film.  I don't think Tom Hanks and Antonio Banderas actually touch in the film-even when they're lying in bed together.  But it still is interesting for what it is.
B0002JP4L4|4.0|I don't think that in real life a pastor can actually outlaw dancing in a town but it makes a decent story. Great highlights in the film are when Kevin Bacon taught Chris Penn's character how to dance(lets hear it for the boy!), the fight scene when Bacon and Penn beat up the corny tough guys,and of course the great dancing during the prom which closed the film.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is Tim Burton's take on the classic children's tale by Rohald Dahl and an update of the dated 1970's movie starring Gene Wilder.  The movie opens setting up the story.  Charlie Bucket lives with his parents and four grandparents and they are beyond poor.  Their shack in the middle of town is bent and twisted and full of holes.  But they live in happiness and hope and entertain each other with stories of their past.  When news hits town that Willy Wonka is opening his factory to five children via a Golden Ticket, Charlie is hopeful he will get one.  His birthday candy bar doesn't contain one nor does the bar he buys with his grandpa's money.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the four other tickets are found by amusing charachitures of kids with the worst traits:  they are gluttoness, spoiled, selfish and rotten and none appreciate the fact they have a golden ticket.  Charlie finds some money on the ground and buys a candy bar.  Amazingly, this bar has a ticket in it.<br /><br />The five kids show up with one family member each at the factory.  Up to this point, Wonka is a mysterious character, being a part of the story but never being shown.  He makes his appearance after a ghastly puppet show introduces him at the factory.  Wonka, played by Depp, is a quirky, amusing guy with a childhood that haunts him to this day.  Some have likened his appearance to that of Michael Jackson.  That only comes through in spots. Wonka as played by Depp is an amusing unique character.<br /><br />The fun part of the movie begins when the kids enter the factory.  All the parts of the story are there, with each of the four bad kids meeting a temporary demise by giving into the worst of their character.  The candy looks delicious and the factory is beautiful to see.  I think kids will like the movie although my four year old was concerned when Augustus Gloop got sucked up the pipe from the Chocolate River.<br /><br />This movie is cute and fun for kids and adults, yet I don't think I laughed outloud once or came close to sharing any sympathy for Charlie or Willy Wonka.ults, yet I don't think I laughed outloud once or came close to sharing any sympathy for Charlie or Willy Wonka.   <br />
B00005JKG5|4.0|The film's portrayal of a young woman persuing her dream is excellent. Although she danced at a bar at night, she still maintained a postive image. She worked hard by day as well to survive and she never let her self fall into the dark side of being a stripper.  The music in the film as well as the dancing and love story keeps you entertained.
0596007124|5.0|My goodness this book actually teaches you how to think in terms of Object orientation and design patterns  I have never seen a better book on design pattern; it makes expert out of novice (OK fine it  makes you comfortable with design patterns)    Ok I would say this book is well written is really cool    Once you finish this book; you will find a lot of buzz words (news letters) from Heinz M. Kabutz, Bruce Eckel, and other java Gurus will start making sense.  (Kool you will find GOF easy to read)        Clearly explains fundamental Design patterns, and provides a deep in-sight into the working of each patterns    I think what -ever ones level of programming experience and irr-respective of language used one should buy this book.    All well said this book is pretty slow to read and some times you find the authors are too verbose and you find your self not having enough time to finish this book.    Probably the authors could have omitted some very elementary materials and I would like a book of this calibre to be read faster    I find moving between pages are bit slower and examples could have been more computer science oriented (Say GOF used a editor for explaining patterns)you happen to get to a pattern much faster (Thinking in terms of ducks & pizza's are fun but doesn't sink in fast enough).  The authors could have explained more about design patterns embedded into java API's.     The head-first series approaches the topics in terms of     Clear-cut explanation +Simple examples + Work-book style of exercise (you might find it vaguely similar to Schaum's series kind of approach That u happen to use in college- Hope some one inspirered by this review writes 2000 solved prob in design pattern's )    The best way to read this book is to use it as a work-book style of reading (Writing), so buy a pack of pencils and fiddle with the examples.     Well solve all the problems provided in the book, thankfully they are simple and doesn't much of your time. (Answers are available in the book for most of the problems)     But any way as I said this material is explosive I would like to thank the authors for writing such a wonderful book.  I would wish that the authors will write a book on the following topics    Head-First Object Oriented Analysis and Design  Head-First J2EE Design -patterns
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|Tom Selleck, Mimi Rogers, Viola Davis, and the rest the cast do an excellent job in this made for TV movie based on the Robert Parker book. This story of a New England sheriff, Chief Jesse Stone, trying to catch a cold calculating serial killer is well crafted. As if that wasn't enough he must catch those responsible for raping a girl. The book is a great read, and the movie does a fine job of following the key premises in the book. The directing by Robert Harmon is superb. I think his previous work as a camera man has given him a wonderful insight in helping the audience see and feel not only the characters clearly, but the surroundings as well.<br /><br />Along with the great job on the main case/story, the other cases/subplots were masterfully done giving a real feel of being there. This is one of the best TV movies I have seen in years. I applaud CBS for backing it. If you are an avid detective reader you should enjoy the book. Fans of detective movies or Tom Selleck should find this one well to their liking. I am happy to say the DVD is excellent. The picture and sound are incredibly sharp. It includes a background of the movie with interviews of the cast and director. I was very pleased that Tom Selleck indicated that the success of this movie has started plans for a series of movies. I can't wait to see the next one!
1400032717|4.0|When I first picked up this book and started reading it, I didn't like it much.  The writing style is exceedingly different then any other book I have read. It's like reading an old children's book with an adult twist. As I read on, it got a lot better and I started to get into it more.   It's from the view of a kid who has autism and ends up running into a horde of troubles through the course of the book.  It has many exciting twists and once you start reading you won't put the book down.  The book is around 200 pages, but it seems much shorter than that when you're reading it. What I didn't like about this book is the middle of it.  It just seemed to slow down and drag on at about page 120.  After about 20 pages it picks up again and flows smoothly till the closing stages.  This is perhaps the only off-putting thing I can say about this book.  All in all, this is a remarkable book and I suggest it to anyone who is looking for a humorous book.
B00005JNJV|4.0|Batman has really never been a great superhero movie franchise, but he's always been a great superhero because he has to do his stuff without superpowers, and is willed by choice more than anything else. Batman Begins is one of the best movies ever at exploring how a superhero becomse a superhero. The darkness one probably would have to go through, as well as the training and experiences, are depicted very well.  <br /> <br />Christain Bale is the best Batman and Bruce Wayne ever on screen. Cillian Murphy is wicked as the devious Scarcrow, and Michael Kane and Liam Neason perform their respective roles of influence well. On the other hand this is one of the few movies I've seen that Morgan Freeman failed to really impress me, and Katie Holms as Bruce's love interest is average at best. The only other real downside to this movie is it's really not a great storyline with a few too many major villans and some confusion towards the end. The actions scenes are terrific, and the new Batmobile is the coolest yet. <br /> <br />The best superhero movies for me are still Superman 1 and 2 and Spiderman 2. Batman Begins is the best Batman by default that none of the others were really that good. What one has to respect about this movie is it's so widely accessable. You can know absolutely nothing about Batman, and still understand and enjoy this. It's great entertainment despite some of its weaknesses. <br /> <br />
B000002G8H|5.0|JJ Cale's rocker \\"Cocaine\\" starts this masterpiece off and the mellow \\"Peaches and Diesel\\" ends it with soothing effect. \\"The Core\\" however is the highlight of this CD, IMO. Of course, \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" is a mainstay of FM stations and deserves recognition. \\"Lay Down Sally\\" is the silliest song Clapton has ever done IMO. Maybe it would have something to do with the fact that I broke up with my wife (who was named Sally) about the time the original vinyl version came out.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|...Between those who love this movie, and those who either hate it because its 'dumb' or they 'just don't get it'. I have  found that the overwhelming factor is AGE. Young people love this movie, and they GET IT. Its a funny movie, and it doesn't need to be explained. Older people seem to hate it, they don't understand it, they see no humor in it, they just don't get it. Now, here's the thing: I'm 35, and I LOVE this movie. You need to ask yourself, can you relate to some of the things kids enjoy today, or are you totally alienated from the youth of today? Your answer might be a good indicator of whether you will like Napoleon Dynamite or not. Even if you aren't young, if you are young at heart, GIVE THIS MOVIE A TRY! You may find it as entertaining as I did. For my money, it is one of the most original, creative, and charming movies to come down the pike in a LONG time. Its everything Hollywood is not these days.     Napoleon Dynamite is not an OUTRIGHT comedy, there are no real slapstick moments or actual jokes, you have to be able to see the humor in mundane (even if slightly skewed) everyday life... And I TOTALLY disagree with Roger Ebert, I don't feel superior to Napoleon, I find the characters absolutely charming and powerful. Of course, Ebert is like 60 now, that tells me something right there...
B0000025DR|4.0|I have never been able to figure out why \\"Fire On High\\" never made it on any ELO compilation (to my knowledge). It rocks and is on the playlists of most FM stations plus it just may be their best song. Of course those stations continue to play \\"Evil Woman\\" and \\"Strange Magic\\" and they should. The biggest drawbacks of this great album is the 36 minute length and lack of remastering. Bonus tracks would be nice to add to this classic rock gem.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Master And Commander is a fantastic movie IF you appreciate historical dramas (think 'Gettysburg'). While it does take liberties with its source material (something others have scored the movie very lowly for) and cannot be considered historically accurate, it does achieve an excellent representation of the period (circa War of 1812).       The sets (comprised mostly of just the ships) are extremely authentic looking, as are the costumes. In addition, the script is excellent. The acting is top-notch, with Russell Crowe doing an outstanding job (much better than I thought he was capable of) and the entire supporting cast turning in admirable performances. There is not a vast amount of action here, the film tends to focus more on the drama aspect (although there ARE battle scenes). If action movies are your favorite, this one is probably not for you. If, however, you appreciate drama mixed with action in a historical setting, Master & Commander is a MUST see. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!

B00007LTIA|5.0|This easily ranks among Yes's best. In 1st place we have Relayer(Duuhh), 2nd place goes to Close To The Edge, and Tales is in 3rd. Tales is a facsinating album, and an underrated one(As are the majority of Yes's albums). I've read many reviews saying that it Tales ranked among Yes's worst and that even hardcore Yes fans would have trouble liking it. All I was thinking was WHAT? .<br /><br /> Well, this was probably their most experimental album, as it doesn't start off as you would expect it to. The album runs 100 minutes long, but those 100 minutes will not be wated, as they will be the most fascinating 100 minutes of your life! The songs are deeper than their previous work-much deeper. It has mind-blowing instrumentation that even Relayer had a tough time beating(of course, no Yes album beats Relayer). I urge you to please ignore all the negative reviewers and judge this album for yourself. Many people seem to be forgetting that we may very well be looking at one of the greatest bands of all time. This is Yes's most fascinating and ambitious work, and to overlook it would be a grave mistake.
B00004RJ71|5.0|I've recently seen this movie for the very first time because my homeboy recommended it.  he said it was one of his favorite movies and that i would also enjoy it.  I checked it out at Blockbuster about a week ago and since that time I've already seen it four times.  I went into the movie with high expectations and i can honestly say that i wasnt let down.  In my opinion the acting for the most part was good with the exception of Popeye.  Another reason i liked this movie so much was because of the way the showed my people Latinos.  The movie does show Latinos as cholos grinding to get by but at the same time lets others view our intelligence and how difficult our struggles our and how hard we work to overcome them.  This movie definitley represents our community and for that reason this movie to me really stands out.
B0000C03AH|5.0|DG has reissued their Karajan 1963 Beethoven cycle many times, and since it has been a front-runner for four decades, no doubt it will be updated any time a new technology appears. I have two versions, this new SACD hybrid, which I play through a regular two-channel system, and the \\"original image bit processing\\" that appeared in DG's complete Beethoven omnibus from the mid-Nineties, now available at mid-price. It was a decided improvement over the initial CD issue from the Eighties, still available as a budget box, which had nasty, edgy sonics.<br /><br />The question is, how much improvement has SACD brought about? A lot if you have surround sound, of course. Through two-channel stereo I think there is noticeable improvment, too, in terms of a rounder, warmer orchestral tone--it's always good to eliminate as much digital glare as possible. I can't tell this new SACD hybrid from a modern recording, but the \\"original image\\" remastering was quite good in its own right. At Amazon the difference in price between the two boxes (new or used) is about 20%, so I would go with the SACD. Don't expect miracles, however; there is sitll a bit of glare in the upper ranges at loud volume, and the balance of the original tapes, which pushed brass and percussion to the rear, hasn't changed in two-channel.
0307276902|1.0|I found the book to be unbelievable from the first page to the last.  Now that it's been shown to be exactly that, I believe the author deserves neither reward nor honor from his efforts.  He deceived his readers for no better reason than ego.  To use his ersatz tough-boy language, it's time to throw this one down.
B00004TDTO|4.0|\\"Jaws\\" is about an island whose popular beach's reputation is threatened when shark attacks suddenly begin popping up out of season.  With the 4th of July coming up, the mayor refuses to close the beach.  But with more and more attacks coming in (all of them fatal) his only option is to send the chief of police, a shark expert, and a shark fisherman on what may be the greatest adventure of their lives. <br /> <br />This movie is what started my phobia of sharks.  I saw a few clips showing the shark when I was young and I was instantly traumatized.  For a long time I was very frightened of sharks.  I could harldy look at pictures of them without getting chills.  But believe it or not, Jaws actually helped me get RID of my phobia...I think.  I thought it would be a terrifying movie, but it wasn't as scary as I thought.  Yes, it would be disturbing for kids or people who get sick at the sight of blood.  But the shark actually wasn't as realistic and violent-looking as I remembered it.  It's eyes were glazed over a lot of the time and it's movements were sometimes kind of unnatural.  Now if that movie had been made today and I watched it, I would probably be curled in a corner shaking with fear.  But the special effects just were not as realistic as I remembered, and I think it helped me let go of part of that fear.  I guess it will be put to the test this summer! <br /> <br />I recommend this movies to those looking for a good movie that keeps you in suspense.  It's actually the music that's the scariest part.  It builds up the anxiety.  I guess that's why that \\"ba-dum...ba-dum...ba-dum\\" is so popular now whenever people are talking about sharks or trying to convey something really scary.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|Kung Fu Hustle has the humor, plot and characters of a silly manga.  Kung Fu fighting, dancing mobsters, silly cartoon style chase scenes and slum lords.  What more could you want?  How about commentary by the director and some of the cast, a behind-the-scenes feature, outtakes and bloopers along with some deleted scenes?  If that isn't enough we get an interview with Stephen Chow himself.  Remember, it is not for kids and the English dubbing sucks, so watch the subtitles.<br /><br />Get it used or new, but do get it.
B00005LOLD|4.0|Based on James Michener's best-selling novel, filmed and set in post-war Japan, this is an intimate character-driven story of miscegenation, racism, and the emerging relationship between America and Japan in the post-war era.  Many of the customs explored here seem old-hat to us now, but were brand-new to Westerners back then:  sushi, sake, kabuki theater etc.<br /><br />Lovingly filmed in 50's Japan and starring an intense, accented Marlon Brando (playing a southern air force colonel from an old-line military family), the battle of accents reach epic proportions when Brando meets the great Japanese Kabuki star, played by none other than....Ricardo Montalban?  That's some fine Japanese Corinthian leather!<br /><br />Depite all that, this film unwinds beautifully and tragically, a serious exploration of important themes that, notwithstanding some dated elements, remains one of Brando's finest 50's efforts.
1591840562|4.0|I particularly liked Guy's casual and sometimes blunt style. His format/content suggestion for your Investor Pitch is worth the price of the book.  Make sure you also get Steven Gary Blank's \\"Four Steps to the Epiphany\\" as well.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Whether you're a fan of action/adventure films, like science fiction with a twist, or are just a pyromaniac, you will probably really enjoy REIGN OF FIRE.<br /><br />The plot seems initially implausable but is pulled off quite well.  Christian Bale is Quinn.  When he is 12, in modern London, his engineer mother unwittingly finds the lair of a huge dragon while building a new Underground line.  Turns out that there are huge numbers of dragons, an ancient species that despoils the planet periodically, then hibernates while life regenerates.<br /><br />The plot is presented in a short opening episode, and a brief flashback montage, crisply done and not belabored.  Likewise, the 'science' of fire breathing dragons and their strengths and weaknesses are presented succinctly, with only as much as is needed to move the briskly-paced plot along.<br /><br />Fast forward about twenty years.  Dragons have laid waste to the earth.  Quinn is leading a small band of survivors in a modified castle.  Their little civilization is slowly failing.  Enter Van Zandt (Matthew McConaughey), an American semi-mercenary leading a small military band on a last quest to kill dragons.  The tense interactions between the Brit and the Yank are well-done with neither too synpathetic or too disagreeable.<br /><br />Director Rob Bowman does a good job, and both the cinematography and sountrack are startlingly good.  But the real strength of REIGN OF FIRE is the dragons (and the Making Of feature on the DVD is thus fascinating.)  They are so life-like; inherently evil and vicious with great mebrane wings, sinister heads and awesome motion!<br /><br />The dragons alone are worth the time spent watching REIGN.  For anyone looking for a good action flick that they'll watch more than once, this opus is well-recommended!
0671004107|5.0|This book was a great treat for me. I have always viewed Carl Sagan with much respect. There is-I believe-no one better qualified who could bring to reality this idea of \\"contact.\\"  Carl Sagan filled his book with such details that made the idea of extraterrestrial contact seem-for once-plausible. He brought his knowledge and wisdom, as seen in Cosmos, to this novel to make it extraordinarily realistic. But it wasn't only his great detail of scientific facts that made the story seem rational; it was also his painstaking detailed descriptions of the lives of all the characters. I don't believe his only message in this novel was that of \\"contact\\"; he had many other messages especially in the intercalary chapters and flashbacks. Contact is an extended parable in a sense; Carl Sagan had much to teach us in both philosophical aspects and in individual and societal thinking. Another facet that made this book an incredible read, were all the quotes at the beginning of each chapter and each part; it makes the reader think more into the story. Carl Sagan's writing style also was attractive. His style of writing is uncommon and makes the read easier. The underlying but prominent theme of Contact is knowledge is power. Carl Sagan knew this very well and he tells us to acknowledge everything in this world and if we do so, we will find the truth.
B0002I8UBG|5.0|In this unusual CD from 1992, her first CD with a full orchestra in almost thirty years, Shirley Horn teams up with composer/orchestra leader Johnny Mandel. Horn has always sung as part of a trio, playing piano (which she considers her primary skill) to the accompaniment of Charles Ables on bass and Steve Williams on drums, and she insisted on recording the songs on this CD originally with just Ables and Williams backing her. Mandel, adapting his own arrangements to her recordings, enhances and emphasizes her music instead of competing with it.<br /><br />As is usually the case, Horn slows down her tempo and sings quietly, sometimes even whispering the words to convey the emotion and drama of the lyrics, as the violins and violas from Mandel's orchestra add to the romance quietly in the background, often playing only chords throughout. Most of the songs begin a capella (or nearly so) with Horn adding her piano to her voice before the song takes off.<br /><br />Three of the most interesting songs are, not surprisingly, Mandel's own songs. \\"A Time for Love,\\" in which Horn laughs when she sings of holding hands, also features a trumpet solo by Wynton Marsalis halfway through, Marsalis playing brightly, but not brassily, in deference to the mood. Marsalis also solos in \\"Quietly There,\\" another Mandel song in which the vibes provide accents to the unusual harmonies and disharmonies of this jazzy interpretation. (Marsalis agreed to substitute for Miles Davis, who passed away before the CD was completed.) \\"Where Do You Start,\\" about the breakup of a household, begins, unusually, with the full orchestra to which Horn adds her piano before beginning to sing, a song of great poignancy and sadness.<br /><br />\\"Return to Paradise\\" shows the advantages of a full orchestra over a trio, as the Latin rhythms inspire a mysterious, atmospheric background of tropical sounds--animal cries, bird song, insects as reproduced by the orchestra--before Horn's long piano solo and lyrical interpretations. Quiet, intimate vocal interpretations, enhanced by a sensitive and self-effacing orchestra leader, create one of the most romantic and moody CDs ever recorded, and one of Horn's best albums. n Mary Whippleical interpretations.

B000A7DVR2|5.0|The Big Lebowski, may not have instantly been, but has definately become one of my all time favorite movies. Its just a really great movie, that always puts me in a good mood, and in this insane life I lead, I rely here and there on The Dude, to remind to just \\"chill.\\" After all, sometimes you hold the bar, and sometimes the bar... however that goes.<br /><br />This movie is a non stop mess of follies and crazy characters. From John Goodmans Walter Solcheck (in my opinion his best role) to Julianne Moores eccentric artsy charecter.. \\"do you enjoy the act of sex, Mr. Lebowski? Coitus?\\"  To the angry cab driver who refuses to compromise with The Dude on the whole Eagles thing. \\"Look, I've had a really bad day, and I hate the F'in Eagles, man!\\"  Or the part with the High School kid... YESS \\"DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU F A STRANGER IN THE A**?\\" Too much!<br /><br />I never was that into The COEN brothers up until they made this film. I didn't care too much for FARGO, even though that was their runaway success story. This one here, is just too cool for school. A definate joy to watch, whenever.
B000AY807Q|5.0|As usual Neil Young is right on the money. Neil has stayed on top of things for 5 decades because he is a constantly changing flow of creatism. This album is no different. Sometimes I think Neil has a seperate personality to go with each of his styles of music. On this album Neil performs much the way you would expect a \\"just turned\\" 60 year old man, facing life threatening ailments, and who just lost his father would. Neil reflects on life, and his memories. He does a heck of a job at it too. To me the entire album is a highlight, but if I had to think of a song that stands out I would have to say it is \\"No Wonder\\". But if I had to choose a quote or a ling from a song I would have to say that the chorus from \\"Far From Home\\" takes it all.<br /><br /> \\"Bury me out on the Prairie<br /><br />  Where the Buffalo used to roam<br /><br />  You won't have to shed a tear for me<br /><br />  Cause then I won't be far from home\\"<br /><br />Then you have the DVD, the DVD is great. As a recording musician myself, I love to see what Neil does in the studio to actually complete a recording like this. Buying this Prairie Wind, and then opening it up and seeing the DVD is like buying a BMW and opening the glovebox and finding a check for $100,000. The DVD is the real jewel of the two!!
B000AXSN5G|4.0|At first I wasn't really thrilled with this one. It's been a while since I dipped into the new NEIL YOUNG files. The last new release I purchased was Broken Arrow back in '96 and that ain't nothing like this. But, my moms got me this one, and she told me to give it a few listens. She tends to dig the soft side of Neil, while I tend to go for the hard grind version, but usually wemeet in the middle; so I gave it a few listens.<br /><br />The first song I liked the best, and was a little skeptical on the rest at first.. but the first track THE PAINTER, I liked. Then however, after a few more listens, I really started to feel this thing. Unlike 2003's Greendale, which sounded sloppily mixed together, this album features a rich mix, of lullabye like songs and dirges.<br /><br />The vocal tracks are extremely cool. They seem to cut through you from time to time. It really stands out on NO WONDER, the second song, which starts to take on a darker feel everytime you listen.<br /><br />Some of these tunes are upbeat in a Harvest sort of way. Theres no bleeding Crazy Horse here. The title track is a honky style romper, with brass.. almost like a Van Morrison track, I like that one. I even enjoyed HE WAS THE KING, with Neil Young cracking a few stale jokes at the end.. \\"Elvis has left the arena!\\" (ah ha ha ha, you jolly bastard...)<br /><br />Anyway. Neil Young always seems to grow on me. I have a good ton of his 35 plus albums, and the fun is you never know what he's coming out with yet. If you like his country/acoustic style stuff, I can reccommend. I actually like this better than his hugely succesful Harvest Moon album, so yeah, I'm talking to all you peeps who flocked towards that one. This record is for you. Its a new season of Harvest.
B00000J7RZ|2.0|There's something about Jennifer that makes me love her to death!  Maybe it's because she's a latina who came up from nothing and made it big.  I admire her in that way because I'm a latina, and I love to see our raza succeed.  BUT holy hell- this girl can't sing.  I think she has SOME of the greatest songs out there, but she doesn't need to be singing them! Jen struggles to hit notes and we suffer through the song. She has sex appeal and a good attitude and morals.  Jen can't act that great.  She was great in \\"Selena\\" and \\"Enough\\".  Plus \\"Monster-in-Law\\" was pretty cute and funny.  But this lady should be modeling cuz she's good to look at- that's it! I don't know how she made it so big from dancing cuz she sucks at that too! I'm not hatin' on her.  She's gorgeous- yes, but that doesn't mean the girl has talent!
B00009V8Z9|1.0|Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience. It is highly recommended that one doesn't expose themselves to this music voluntarily though. To do so would expose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the one's world view in small, and the world at large. Anyone who likes this doesn't like music, but I wouldn't know, I don't like music either-I like MOGWAI-Good boys from Glasgow Scotland that know how to rock. For \\"If it dunnae rock 'tis piss\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best sci-fi show (actually the best show, period) to be on the air in quite some time, if not ever.  It has witty dialogue, strong characters, complicated relationships, AND good paralells making fun of real life.  The only thing the shows missing is another season or two (or three, or four, or...).  If you like high quality tv shows, sci-fi tv shows, funny tv shows, witty tv shows, tv shows about relationships, or tv shows at all, you will love this series.
B000BP86OG|1.0|Hey, I TOLD YOU SO. Yes indeed, way back in The Curmudgeon's list of musical mishaps was The Darkness and their first album which, while being very popular, was complete junk. And here's the second album - which is exactly the same. But, and here's where I was right, without the very popular part. Or indeed, the popular.<br /><br />It's funny, you won't believe the hate mail I got for my review of the first Darkness record. I was told that \\"The Darkness are our saviours\\" (Ho ho ho, I'm sorry, that's very cute) and that I obviously don't appreciate \\"real\\" rock music. Well, if your definition of \\"real\\" is ugly nonces dressing up for cheap laughs with even cheaper songs, hiding behind crap lyrics with a grating falsetto well, guess what? You don't know what \\"real\\" rock music is either.<br /><br />Right from the first single, it was clear The Darkness' days were numbered. \\"One Way Ticket..\\" is NO \\"I Believe In A Thing Called Love\\" (the ONLY thing this novelty band will be remembered for). It's a tired pastiche of every 80's hair band you've ever heard, only without any of the good bits you remember.<br /><br />What's REALLY funny about The Darkness, though - is that Justin Hawkins clearly believed he was something extra special. The mammoth sales of the first album obviously went to his head, as his bloated ego took a swipe at other bands (real bands, mind you) and they claimed to be \\"the saviours of rock and roll - again!\\" Not quite this time, eh boys? Because this album didn't go to number one. It came in near the bottom end of the top ten and then sank without trace.<br /><br />That's the trouble with these joke bands. Once the joke wears thin, where else can they go? Well, if the truly DIRE second single \\"Is It Just Me\\" is anything to by, it's a one way ticket to bargain bin hell - and they won't be coming back from that.<br /><br />[...]
B000696PWC|5.0|The \\"European Madonna\\" Kylie Minogue has always been a person of intrigue to me. Her music is catchy, infectious and unique, yet she doesn't get much recognition in the States. It amazes me how the worthless, bland talent of Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson has overshadowed Kylie's existence. I consider myself a new American Kylie fan, I exaggerate American because most Americans only know her as the chick who released \\"Can't Get You Out My Head\\" in 2001 and \\"Locomotion\\" in 1988...and these aren't even Kylie's best songs. This is pretty sad considering how we Americans are supposed to know what's hip in music. So to start off my venture into Kylie-dom I decided to get Ultimate Kylie, an extensive 2 disc, 33 song collection of Kylie's biggest hits from the 80's, 90's and 00's to start off getting into Kylie's music. All I can say is that this is the best greatest hits album I own, I mean it's great song after great song and Kylie's style of music is ever evolving so she goes from campy 80's pop, to early 90's dance to Indie stylings to revival disco to urban hip-hop, so you do not get tired of hearing the same music. The girl has an impressive range, no doubt.  <br />I'm not going to go into each and every song because there's alot to cover but I will go over some of the most standout ones in my opinion.  <br /> <br />For Disc 1: The first CD starts off with the peppy and flowing, \\"Better The Devil You Know\\", a great Kylie piece. \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" is SAW bubblegum pop at it's finest while \\"Step Back In Time\\" is infectious and pays homage to the old school jams of the O'Jays. \\"What Do I Have To Do\\" is energetic and darn catchy while \\"Hand On Your Heart\\" is a upbeat sound of something that American 80's pop princesses Tiffany or Debbie Gibson would have done, I guess the lyrics remind me of some of their work. \\"Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi\\" is a cute pop piece while the remake of Chairman Of The Board's 70's hit \\"Give Me Just A Little More Time\\" is incredible with agreat horn section backing Kylie up and where Kylie makes the song better than the original.  <br /> <br />For Disc 2: The new song, \\"I Believe In You\\" is a nice love song and has a rousing techno beat to it. Possibly one of my fave Kylie tracks, \\"Love At First Sight\\" is a club thumping intergalactic romp while \\"Slow\\" is seductive and cunning. Disco infused, \\"On A Night Like This\\" and \\"Spinning Around\\" (which was co-written by none other than Paula Abdul!) are excellent. The duet \\"Kids\\" with Robbie Williams, is a rocking thrill ride where as \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" takes on an urban hip-hop approach. \\"Confide In Me\\" and \\"Put Yourself In My Place\\" are equally gorgeous and probably my two favorites off of this Disc. Painstaking and mournful yet poetic, Kylie sings these with flair. <br /> <br />I'm baffled as to why Kylie hasn't hit it as big Stateside. After scanning fan-sites of hers on the web I can see that Kylie is a HUGE and I'm talking HUGE part of the European, Japan and especially Australian music scene. I'm kind of sadden that she doesn't tour over here but I think with the growing number of fans here in the States maybe she should reconsider.  <br />You get the Ultimate with Ultimate Kylie and I have now christened myself a new fan and I'm also planning on purchasing more Kylie CDs in the near future. This is a great, and I'm stressing GREAT, selection of hits to get if you want to get into Kylie's music. You can hear her grow with the years, from being a SAW bubblegum pop princess, to a sleek sophisticated dance songstress, to a disco-techno diva, Kylie has worn all the hats and maybe she'll wear more as her star keeps on shining! Go Kylie! <br />
0142004235|5.0|What an incredible book.  It is beautifully written.  It really makes you think about things.  The characters are intriguing, especially Kate and Cal.  I loved Lee, what a great character.  This is a classic I would recommend to anyone.
B000002LQR|5.0|i have a soft spot for this album. it is truly one of the best albums ever made. i am not a die-hard fan of the chili peppers. in fact- never listened to them very much after this cd. but what a cd this is. i mean DAMN- sexy, passionate, touching, witty, nasty, descriptive, dirty. this is a masterpiece. i love it, and it will be on my \\"top ten\\" list forever.
B00005JOIF|5.0|\\"Munich\\" is a thoroughly engrossing film.  It is a thoughtful production with great performances by Eric Bana in the lead role as Avner, Geoffrey Rush as his handler, Efraim, and Lynne Cohen as Golda Meir.  Bana's effort alone is worthy of an Oscar.<br /><br />Yet what distinguishes this film from the usual thriller is its ambiguities.  Killing the bad guy is more than just a few gun shots and the matter is solved.  Avner leads a team killers seeking retribution from the brains of the Munich tragedy.  He is determined to fulfil his task but this doesn't stop him from having doubts.  In short, the man has scruples.<br /><br />In the US, many have criticised this ambiguity.  However, rather than seeing it as a weakness, I regard it as part of the film's strength.  All killings must involve doubt.  It is a particularly ruthless person who could behave otherwise.  Steven Spielberg has done the world a service by showing that events are rarely black and white.  Shades of grey are inevitable.
B000AP04NI|1.0|I have read the scathing reviews and am now perturbed. This dvd I was going to buy. The previous release was not all that good but I was expecting better things this time. It seems that Fox have upset many customers this time and definitely need to come up with some solution. It does make you wonder what the thinking is when a Todd A O presentation is seemingly so bad.Right.....Fox . You have been badly damned in these reviews. It seems your credibility now demands some action to put right this bad disc presentation. It can be done and it seems your customers on this occasion are demanding it. I wonder if you are going to listen? I hope so.
6304907648|4.0|The first time I saw this movie was in a hotel room in Moorhead, MN. (Save the Fargo jokes for later).   <br /> <br />This wasn't supposed to be linked with \\"Silence\\", or even \\"Bone Collector\\".  Since both of those are original serial killers and dealt with a darker, more morose tone.  This is really a paint-by-numbers thriller, but still was enough to hold me in its clutches for the entire time.   <br /> <br />\\"Silence\\" didn't deal with a who's who of mass murderers and a Top 10 list of infamy as \\"Copycat\\" does.  Bundy, Bianca, Zodiac Killer...all of them are mentioned, and it's nice to see a film give nods to the *ahem* best known names in American Crime.   <br /> <br />In the days of Dr. Phil, Loveline, and Oprah cry-a-thons...it's good to know there are movies out there that still don't really go out and explain away-or try to cure-the criminally unjust minds.   <br /> <br />SPOILER: It's evident by the first time we see Foley's home life why he is the way he is...and most people can profile a serial killer or \\"creepy guy\\", but for the most part, \\"Copycat\\" didn't bonk you on the head to tell me why he was a putz.   <br /> <br />Definitely worth a few dollars for viewing on a Saturday evening
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|This movie is perfectly realized and the second disk has tons of extras, it discuses the vast locals and weaponry among many other things, just a great DVD. As for the movie, I loved it, as a kid I was more into the Marvel Comic characters, and was a bit after the 60's Batman, but I knew about the character and was thrilled when the first Batman movie came out, I was a bit disappointed, I found it depressingly dark, but Nicholson as the Joker was a revelation, I have seen the subsequent movies and was not exactly bowled over, though Carey was great as Riddler, and Phieffer, just smokin as Catwoman.  I was a bit wary of this movie, but when I saw it I was blown away, I loved it, Bale was great as Batman, Nieson even better as Rah al Ghul, and Murphy looked like he was having a ball with Scarecrow, as for the story, it was perfectly done, dark, but not oppressing so, and I really liked how the story goes easily from the present to the past and back again..well done. The interaction between Bale and Nieson, was riviting and Bales relationship with Caine was touching, I really can't wait until the next one, but who will play Joker?  If you appreciate action packed, fun movies, then you will love this movie, it really does not matter if you are into Batman or not, it's just a great movie, and this DVD has so many cool extra's that even if you have seen it, it is well worth the price to buy the C.D., highly recommended
B000002UJQ|5.0|It's not very often that a person can consider listening to a record an event. I'm not talking the kind of event consisting of listening to music while eating dinner or in the car on the way to work but as in sitting alone in quiet room, closing your eyes and engrossing one's self in the music heard from a good set of headphones. When I listen to Radiohead's OK Computer it is just that: an event. Not just the first time, every time and I've listened to it at least fifty times.  <br /> <br /> I think it's also safe to say that, commonly, a record of music doesn't change an individual's life in any significant way though many music lovers make this claim I'm sure only a percentage sincerely mean it. That being said, I wholeheartedly believe that Radiohead's third and essential album, in fact, changed my life, in the way I perceive music, politics, art and literature. Never before did I realize, or appreciate, the art of recorded music. OK Computer has many layers of skin, hiding secrets waiting to be discovered upon peeling. This album gives me a different perspective on loneliness, paranoia, love, life, economics, space travel and seemingly anything I dare to question. It can provoke a different emotion with each listen and can satisfy my desires during any mood or occasion. <br /> <br /> Beginning with a burst of grandeur the opening track \\"Airbag\\", with the sound of chimes, crackling and white noise, the song slowly develops into, quite possibly, the equivalency of emotions felt after surviving a crash. As the music fades out \\"Paranoid Android\\" fades in, a multi-layered epic, teetering between melancholy and madness. As Thom Yorke crows \\"the crackle of pig skin/ the yuppies networking/ the vomit/ the vomit/ god loves his children\\" it becomes very apparent he's reaching much deeper than most would dare, a fact that becomes further realized with the next track \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" perhaps a dedication to Dylan and old sci-fi films.  <br /> <br /> As the album continues it only goes deeper and becomes more auspicious. \\"Exit music (for a film)\\" is a dark, haunting story of a young couple trying to escape the tyranny of an evil father. Yorke whispers the lyrics in our ear \\"wake from your sleep\\". Following this comes, in my opinion, Radiohead at their very best with \\"Let Down\\" diverse, roller coaster ride of a song laced with a bone chilling mixture of music captivating the mind with white noise in every direction, backing vocals sneaking in and out, waves crashing, bottle breaking, guitars that sound like singing birds all of this surrounding mesmerizing lyrics about \\"Motorways and tramlines\\", \\"Disappointed people/ clinging onto bottles\\" and \\"crushed like a bug on the ground\\". Disorder and the feeling of being lost in the mass of wreckage never seemed so splendid.  <br /> <br /> As the album drifts to its center \\"Karma Police\\" ascends into the scenery with its lethargic cool and cockiness. The keys of the piano are slammed upon, the guitar is wailed on and Yorke moans his dismay regarding detuned radios, Hitler hairdos and being on the payroll. By the end his only consolation is that he only momentarily lost himself. The album turns the corner to relinquish a surprise to its listeners when the sound of a mechanical voice, not Thom Yorke, reads a \\"how to\\" list to a \\"Fitter Happier\\" life. This track is experimental and quite maddening all the while maintaining its freshness and stark independence. <br /> <br /> From here any listener feeling a sense of lull will again be on their feet with the raunchy, straightforward rock song \\"Electioneering\\" consisting of palpable drums, undaunted guitar bliss and vigorous vocals from start to finish. Then with a boom comes \\"Climbing up the Walls\\", which has been called \\"the scary song\\". <br /> <br /> \\"Either way you turn, I'll be there/ open up your skull, I'll be there,\\" Yorke resonates, his voice on this track sincerely startling. \\"Climbing up the Walls\\" sound causes a primal fear asthe hairs on your neck stand you wonder, is there \\"eyes in the cupboard\\". <br /> <br /> The perfect remedy for your terror swoons in at the nick of time with \\"No Surprises\\". The ding-dongs and chimes reminding me of a commercial or children's show jingle, signifying all is sweet and safe. That's the surprise though as Yorke sings \\"bruises that won't heal\\" and later \\"such a pretty house/ such a pretty garden\\" followed directly by the calming and sane backing vocals \\"getting me out of here\\".  <br /> <br /> The record winds down with one of the bands finest songs \\"Lucky\\" a melancholy yet hopeful tune bursting with guitar riffs and white noise and a sound similar to a weeping woman. The closing is as close to perfect as any band has ever attempted to be, elevating to a rupturing climax.  <br /> <br /> The final track is \\"The Tourist\\" a ghostly tune about speeding through life with reckless abandon, ending the record with a simple ding, like an alarm going off. Sometimes you have to slow down and take a look at the world, other wise it may swallow you whole. <br />  <br /> Radiohead's OK Computer presents many emotions, ideas, sounds and perspectives. Every listen can encourage a different interpretation. Every listen can challenge a conflicting thought on music, politics, relationships and the human psyche. Every listen can depress you or cheer you up. Every listen is an event. <br /> <br /> I know that every time I listen to OK Computer it will be a monumental experience, which ranks as one of the most rewarding events of my insignificant life.      <br />   <br />  <br />
B000C65Z1G|5.0|\\"Constant Gardner\\" is a riveting movie!  It starts off as an ordinary love story between the two main characters played by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz.  Soon into the movie Rachel's character of Tessa (wife of Fiennes's Justin Quayle) is killed off with Quayle as played by Ralph Fiennes trying to find out the \\"why\\".  He, of course, finds out that there was FAR more to his wife than he thought.  That \\"far more\\" makes a wonderful thriller filled with all kinds of unsavory characters involving the continent of Africa and its healthcare for the masses with loads of money involved.   <br /> <br />The film kept me riveted to the screen trying to keep the \\"goings on\\" \\"straight\\" in my head.  At the same time that the movie is being a thriller it never loses the \\"Love Story\\" element.  I always was made fully aware, at all times, that the movie was primarily about the love shared between the two main characters. <br /> <br />This movie really has it all-great thriller, great acting, great direction and great cinematography!  I loved it.  The movie enthralled me at all levels.  .   <br />
0743454537|5.0|I had people tell me that this book sounded morbid, and wondered why I wanted to read it. I wanted to read it because I wondered how a girl of 13 years could me mature enough to make such an important decision. I loved the book, I loved being able to see everyone's view on the situation. I was reading this book non-stop and would recommend this to anyone who want to read a book that will tug at your heart.
1400032717|4.0|Have you ever imagined what it would be like to be in the mind of an autistic person? In this book, the author did a superb job of writing from the mind of a young autistic boy. It opened my eyes as to what autism is and the different forms it takes. His matter-of-fact explanation of things made for some amusing reading. The way he (Christopher) explained his actions actually made sense, even though to a \\"normal\\" person, the thought pattern would make no sense. The illustrations also added to the character of the book. This story was not only entertaining, but also enlightening. I could hardly put it down, though it did slow down toward the end. It is a compelling quick-read.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone, especially someone dealing with similar challenges at home.
B00003W8NM|4.0|The special edition bonus DVD is pretty indepth.  There is plenty of bonus material to keep you busy for a while.  There are deleted scenes included and you can actually choose the angle at which you will view some of them.  Pretty cool.  There are many short featurettes for which you can also choose the audio and visual options.  Overall, the special edition is a good step up from the original DVD.  The case is a cool matte finish and it folds out neatly. <br /> <br />I genuinely enjoyed this movie.  It lets conservative people live out their fantasies through the character of Tyler Durden, much like Michael Douglas did to a degree in \\"Falling Down\\".  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are truly remarkable together in this movie and they each seem to be irreplaceable in their respective roles.  The scenes are gritty, grimey and nearly morbid, for the most part- which lends it a certain lure.  This film appeals to the primal part of most people.  I, personally, thought it was wonderfully different and very enjoyable. <br /> <br />Definitely recommended viewing.
1573223085|4.0|It has great moments where you can sit for a few minutes and apply it to yourself. Well written.
B00004R764|5.0|I seen these guys twice on this tour so watching the video brings it all back to me.  I was confused about the title also, but someone explained that it is a play on words.  Instead  of Cunning Stunts, they are really saying, Stunning C**nts.  Too bad this isn't on DVD!
B000001ESP|3.0|The most i can give this is three stars. I think even that is being somewhat kind to this. <br /> <br />\\"Moving Pictures\\" is the band's most overrated and over-hyped effort in my personal opinion, this coming from a life-fan. It's constantly hailed as RUSH's finest moment, but i bet this probably comes mostly from causual listeners, critics and newbie band-wagon fans. Any REAL fan of this trio knows that they have cut much stronger and consistant albums, before and after, this. For some reason i just could not listen to this album without hitting the \\"SKIP\\" button on my player a couple of times, great albums are solid from start to finish, \\"Moving Pictures\\" simply isn't one of them, no matter how popular it is with RUSH newbies or how many \\"Greatest Albums Ever\\" lists it get ploped on. <br /> <br />Ok, granted, side one IS very good, maybe even better then good. You basically have the three mainstream radio \\"hit\\" songs and a niffty instrumental. \\"Tom Sawyer\\" is undoubtably their most popular song, ever, but god, mainstream FM radio has ruined it by overplaying it too the extent of inducing vomit. \\"Red Barchetta\\" is a mini epic and pretty good, even if a little cheesy. \\"YYZ\\" is a intrumental, and the best song on the album. \\"Limelight\\" is a standard, clishe \\"Rockstardom&Fame\\" song lyrically, althouth it is sonically a damn good song with one of the best solo's from Lifeson. <br /> <br />Then there is side two.... <br /> <br />wow, i mean WOW. This is where it literally all goes down hill like a boxcar racer that has just lost it's wheels. What started out on side one as a promising album from the band goes straight to hell on side two, lets take a look.... <br /> <br />Side two starts out with, what is without a doubt in my mind, the worst RUSH song ever devised, \\"The Camera Eye\\". I guess they wanted to make one last extened piece, attempting to make another \\"Cygus X-1\\" or \\"Xanadu\\" type song clocking in at around the 10 minute mark, but unlike those two masterpieces,this fails horribly. If you ever suffer from insomnia, listen to this. <br /> <br />\\"Witch Hunt\\" is absolutly pointless. It trys to sound scary with those synths, but it just ends up being a complete waste of precious recording time. <br /> <br />\\"Vital Signs\\" sounds like a B-side Police song. I hate this song, it should burn in hell. Sounds like they just started experimenting and decided to paste non-sensicle lyrics to it and make it into a song. <br /> <br /> <br />Well, it's got three radio-freindly pop tunes, a kick @$$ instrumental and the rest an utter and complete waste. A masterpiece, huh?  They would put out much stronger albums in the mid 80s such as \\"Signals\\" and \\"Grace Under Pressure\\", yet they doen't even get a fraction of the attention that this turkey does. You see, these guys get better with age i think, they matured consideralbly from their 70's prog-rock era and continulally kept getting beter and better.This album was simply a mistep in a attempt to capitolize on the commercial success of the exellent \\"Permanent Waves\\" album. <br />
B00005JO1J|5.0|I was disturbed, as mentioned in other reviews, by the PG13 rating of this movie becuase of the blatant(and sometimes gratouious feeling)exhibitions of homosexuality, and lesbianism. Also the \\"CatScratch Club\\" number is not child friendly. That said.<br /><br />I never saw the Broadway production but would believe the original actors are in the movie. The way they portray their characters is very stagelike, but it adds to the feel of the movie overall. The original actors may appear to be older than what their characters should be, but I think this too was better than using younger actors that have less life experience and could not play the same roles with as much depth. Rosario Dawson was a standout as Mimi, but the rest of the cast was also amazing!<br /><br />The soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful, reminding us all that we only have 525,600 minutes a year to live life at the fullest, and I think the message to be gained from this movie is that is doesn't matter how you live, just as long as you live doing what you love surrounded by people you love.<br /><br />The movie overall is very worthwhile to see, and after I've seen it, I clearly understand why it did so well on Broadway. The movie IS NOT as depressing as it may appear originally and is worth seeing - maybe after the kids are asleep.
B000AYQNYI|5.0|I have been a fan since 89 and have of course listened to SWW many, many times.  Well, until you listen to the High Resolution 5.1 mix of SWW contained on this disc on a good home theatre setup, you have not heard this album at it's best. <br /> <br />The High Resolution 5.1 mix just blows me away in terms of it's clarity and the separation of vocals (both main and backing) and instruments.  Jon's voice sounds fantastic.  As a bonus virtually every track has been tweaked or remixed to some extent - some more than others ie Livin On A Prayer, Raise Your Hands, Never Say Goodbye.  But listen carefully, you'll be pleasantly surprised by all the subtle differences in the tracks. <br /> <br />If you have the right equipment, you should definately get this version of the album.  You will not be dissapointed! <br /> <br />I'm just hoping that Island Records release both the New Jersey and  Keep The Faith albums in this format.  Now, that would be heaven!
B000002R48|4.0|Dream Theater is arguably at the forefront of Progressive Rock (or if you prefer Progressive Metal) music and have been since Images and Words was released.  What few people realize is that When Dream & Day Unite was their first album.<br /><br />This album right away shows that it's very different from the others due to the fact that James LaBrie is not the lead singer on their debut album.  In my opinion this shows that the lead singer can make all the difference as musically this album is very sound and gives but a mere taste of things to come once James LaBrie takes over lead vocals.<br /><br />Ytse Jam stands above the rest as far as songs goes.  The rest of the songs are good but none seem to stand up and be noticed.  I recommend this album for die hard fans.
B0009R1T7M|3.0|The Vince Guaraldi comparison is apt, as a lot of the busy piano lines recall none other than Peanuts.<br /><br />I like this album and it's growing on me steadily, however the conceit of the \\"50 albums for 50 states\\" is already wearing thin.  Is \\"Rhode Island\\" going to be an EP?  How could anyone hope to fit the wild expanse of Alaska, the sheer cultural density of New York (the city could be a box set, let alone the state), or the abundant cliches of California (hmmm, which California should we represent?  The political soap opera?  The stunning arboreal parks and coasts?  The glitz of Hollywood?  The immigrant labor that built much of it?  The suntanned surfers?) onto one CD?  What does one do with a more subdued state like Wyoming?  Or Nebraska (already been done by Springsteen)?<br /><br />Sufjan Stevens should focus on writing great music -- something he is adept at already -- and leave the grand overarching themes to Gilbert and Sullivan.  It would be tragic to see a gifted young musician burn out trying to catalog the histories, joys, and pathologies of an entire nation.
B000CBSHK2|4.0|Beth Orton's Central Reservation is one of my most loved and worn-out records, and as an artist I hold her in very high regard. Orton's musical integrity, uniqueness and high songwriting standards seemed to be intact from day one of her career, and her voice has always been unmistakably beautiful. No one sounded like Beth Orton back in the mid 90's and nobody does now.<br /><br />Having said all that, I thought she might have stalled a bit with her last full-length album - 2002's Daybreaker. Daybreaker wasn't without a good song or two, and was actually a pretty good record by most people's standards, it's just that you come to expect so much more from a songwriter of Beth Orton's class. Pleasingly, four years on, any notions of a slide in quality have been well and truly dispelled by her new effort Comfort Of Strangers.<br /><br />Comfort Of Strangers is less immediate than previous releases and more understated musically and melodically, but sure enough, little by little, these songs begin to get under your skin. The electronic touches that adorned her earlier work are now gone in favour of a more organic approach courtesy of sympathetic producer Jim O'Rourke (Wilco). He allows Orton's soulful folk/pop songs room to breathe, and in moving away from technology her new material becomes imbued with a real sense of timelessness.<br /><br />Lyrically too, she's in top form. Orton has a knack of writing about the important stuff, without being.... well.... all important about it. Like the great writer Raymond Carver, Orton sings about love, life and the nature of humanity by observing the little details, cracks and fissures in daily existence that tend to get passed over for the more obvious moments. A good example of this is the beautiful, autumnal 'Safe In Your Arms' which is located, appropriately, at the heart of the album. It's about the role that fear plays in love, but lyrically, it's all shadows, whispers, and wind rustled trees. As songs go, it's vintage Beth Orton, yet it also reflects her maturation as a songwriter. By some margin, 'Don't Need A Reason' has always been my favourite Beth Orton song, but I might need to rethink that now that the lovely 'Safe In your Arms' is in existence. I can't speak highly enough of this wonderfully moving piece of music. But there's plenty more where that come from.<br /><br />The unusually jaunty opener 'Worms', which for all money sounds like a Fiona Apple homage, can claim one of the best and quirkiest opening lines to an album in recent memory with \\"worm's don't dance they haven't got the balls\\". C'mon, how can you top that? - it's pure poetry. Elsewhere, the pop splendour of 'Conceived' is sure to please both old fans and newcomers alike, and the elaborate, finely rendered melodies of the title track and 'Shadow Of A Doubt' get better and better with each play. Actually, the same is true for the rest of this collection.<br /><br />Comfort Of Strangers is likely to cement Beth Orton's reputation as one of the finest and most important singer-songwriters of her generation and I think that it's finally safe now for Joni to hand over that baton.<br /><br />Like this? Try><br />Brandi Carlile - Brandi Carlile<br />Tracy Chapman - Where You Liverton, yet it also reflects her maturation as a songwriter.

1400034205|4.0|Maugham seems to capture the essence of both the hope and hopelessness that pervaded western culture after World War I. He brings a unique perspective, writing as an Englishman about Americans living abroad, whom he knows well but not altogether intimately, through his association with a prominent socialite, Elliott Templeton. Maugham is very much a part of the story, which is purportedly about real people known to him, with only names and aspects of their identity changed \\"to save them embarrassment\\".  <br /> <br />In some ways this novel reads like a Robert Altman movie, given the continuous intersection of loosely connected lives. Maugham masterfully draws us into what he begins with a clear waiver as \\"a novel with little story to tell...ending in neither death nor marriage\\". The characters, seen through Maugham's cynical and somewhat weary eye, are often vacuous, and caught up in the go-getting times of pre-Depression America in the 1920's. Maugham seems to live the idyllic life of a writer, coming and going as he pleases, abroad and at home. He moves from Paris, to the Riviera, to London, to the US Midwest (namely, Chicago) with apparent ease. Borne out of this socializing, social-climbing era, emerges Larry, a vague and seemingly indecisive young man, who moves into a life of self-described \\"loafing\\", and turns down potential millions and worldly success in its traditional sense. Maugham seems eventually drawn into Larry's idealism, witnessing a man who would rather read textbooks and classic writings for 8-10 hours a day and live in third rate accomodations while the charms of Paris surround him. <br /> <br />There is too much nuance of character and wonderful descriptions of France and Europe, to adequately do justice in a short review, but Maugham writes with a subtle dispassion that makes the characters believable, at times sympathetic, at other times, abhorrent. Whether Larry's search was ultimately futile or worthwhile is left to the judgment of the reader, but one cannot help but be affected by the characters as described by this gifted writer. Elliott Templeton, the socialite, in particular is as empty and catty as he is compassionate and thoughtful, and this nuance is well captured by Maugham. <br /> <br />Despite being bogged down in a minor way at times, I found this to be a most rewarding novel, and arresting in its telling.

B000BT97AO|5.0|Some tales are told best around a campfire.  Others belong on the pages of a book. And some stories demand to be told via the film medium. Mirror Mask, I feel, is one of these. From the first moment when the theatre darkened to when the last credit scrolled off the screen, I was entranced.  And I walked away convinced that this particular story could not have been told as effectively in any other way.I left the theatre feeling the intense genius-envy I get whenever I experience something Neil Gaiman has had a hand in.<br /><br />As a purveyor of fantasy, I read a tremendous amount in the field and see many movies in the genre.  It's so easy to become jaded, so easy to see exactly where the current of a tale is carrying you; and then I encounter something like Mirror Mask and I fall in love all over again.  I realize afresh that fantasy has no boundaries.<br /><br />There are movies that leave me with a feeling of satisfaction, where I give a great sigh and feel content with a wonderful ending.  Others, like Mirror Mask, set off a string of creative fireworks inside my mind and leave me fully charged and ready to see all the wonderful beginnings in the world.<br /><br />I highly recommed this film.
B00022XOAO|5.0|I have seven different versions of Beethoven's Pastoral. This one is, by far, the best. Some compalin that his interpretation of the tempo is poor, and off the mark. First, this is factually incorrect. Kleiber is simply the first person of the modern era to follow Beethoven's OWN tempo markings. The first movement is 8.34 long (Compared to Solti's interpretation at 11.47 and Karajan's at 9, and Rattle's at 12.36). This fast tempo is weird at first only because we aren't used to it, but once one allows it to penetrate them, they realize a Pastoral Symphony that is not pretentious. One that shows the pure enlightment of a man who has conqured his Fate and is now exuberant to return to the country. <br /> <br />Compared with von Karajan's sloppiness, and Rattle's almost sleepy interpretation, Kleiber's is a breath of fresh air. Also, towards the end of the first movement he quiets the rest of the orchestra so that the singing birds may really come through. This piece is filled with many other such surprises which make it a must purchase for any Classical library.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|This movie has everything that was lacking from the last 3 \\"Star Wars\\" movies:  good plot, interesting 3 dimensional characters, witty dialogue.  It did more with a miniscule budget, than so many special effects driven movies could begin to do.  After all, does it really matter how pretty a movie is, when you don't care about the characters or what happens to them?   <br /> <br />Lately the emphasis in SciFi movies has been style over substance.  \\"Serenity\\" actually has substance.  I do think some of the more subtle things from the movie will be missed by anyone who isn't familiar with the TV series that it is based upon, \\"Firefly.\\"  So I would recommend becoming familiar with the series first to get the most out of the movie.  The movie is a little darker than the series, but I consider both to be worth owning, and I do indeed have the DVD set from the series as well as \\"Serenity\\" the movie.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it was a little too dark for my tastes, but that is just my preference and has nothing to do with the actual quality of the movie. <br /> <br />It may not be to everyone's tastes, but if you value substance over style, character driven movies vs. action driven movies, and witty dialogue; then this is the movie for you!  Don't get me wrong, it has plenty of action, but it is more character driven.  It is not constant action-packed action.  On the other hand, if you think Jar Jar Binks is the best character to come along in ages, you may want to skip this one.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Love is a force of nature...the tagline from this incredible movie...sums up in essence the message portrayed on the screen. Ennis DelMar and Jack Twist (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall respectively) first encounter each other while waiting for possible work. The first few minutes of the movie are without dialogue, establishing through brilliant direction and camera work the tone that already exists between the two men as they look everywhere but at each other. After getting the job, they wind up on Brokeback Mountain, tending sheep. The vast vistas of the land...the wide open sky...and the lonely and simple music of Gustavo Santaolalla, all serve to enhance the isloation of these two men. The rest of the world seems to not exist...only Jack and Ennis. Jack, the more animated of the two, has a certain childlike quality about him, his puppy-dog eyes revealing much that his words do not. Ennis, in opposition, seems like a man older than his years with the weight of the world on his shoulders. The interaction between them is brief, curt, and true to life as two people, isolated from all others, are forced to come to grips with each other's personalities. The love that grows out of this, however, is one that can only happen once in a lifetime. Becoming friends, and then more than friends, Jack and Ennis forge a bond that spans decades and a lifetime. Through all that life brings them, marriages, children, divorce, loss of jobs, family problems, and even discovery by Ennis' wife, the ties that bind them together survive. While Jack wants more, believing they can build a life together, dispite what society considers exceptable, Ennis, ever stoic, believes otherwise. As the story unfolds over the years, the viewer is taken along on each man's personal journey, witnessing the lives that they lead while holding fast to each other through occasional fishing trips that do not involve fishing. The climax of the movie leaves the viewer stunned, even if prepared by reading the book, and induces an emotional firestorm, calling to mind past loves, current partners, and future dreams. Heath Ledger bestowes the performance of his career on the viewer with dignity and emotional depth that was only hinted at in his previous work. Jake Gyllenhall finally realizes the potential that the critics foresaw in him and also puts in his best work to date. The interaction of the two principal actors is believable, conceivable, and all together entrancing. The supporting cast is also brilliant, each bringing to their character a fully realized person no matter the size of their role. The direction and cinematography is a masterpiece, bringing to light the isolation of the wilderness, the desperation of small towns of the era, and the complete dissimilarity of the classes of the time. Ang Lee has created a world where the viewer feels he or she can touch, taste, smell, and feel all that is portrayed on the screen. The movie itself is beyond masterful and has the potential to change one's view...perhaps one's life. If a viewer can watch this movie and not be moved beyond any expectation, if they can watch this movie and walk away without tears in their eyes, then they are completely incapable of understanding love or their prejudices are such that they are blinding themselves to the realities of the world. The movie claims that \\"Love is a force of nature\\"...bold words and ones that a cynic can easily discount. However, when you see this remarkable film, you will truly believe.
B00002DE0S|5.0|These are undoubtedly the best Chopin's concerti ever recorded. Even if I knew no other performance, after hearing this recording I'd know it's perfect. Until I first heard it, I hadn't ever thought a Polish orchestra could be so excellent. One of the reviewers, Ms Zbikowska (przy okazji, pozdrawiam) wrote she bought these CDs because of patriotic duty :) I'm also Polish, but since I consider most of music pieces to be rather beyond nationality, our Ferdek Ch. will never be my favourite composer because of his nationality :)  <br /> <br />Instead, I bought this CD because of Zimerman, who in my opinion is the best today's pianist. I am not disappointed, moreover, I have been rewarded more than I counted for. It's difficult to describe (how can we describe music not to lose something from its beauty and depth)...  <br /> <br />Just listen to the slow theme in the 1st movement of the E minor concerto, no matter performed by the orchestra alone or Zimerman with the orchestra. God, when I heard it, this was the first time I ever thought of Chopin's concertos: 'This isn't a sweet, candy-style music, this is real, pure beauty!' Zimerman really feels this music, understands it, thus knows how to play it. And these young talented people from the orchestra... I want them to become our National Philharmonic players! I know Zimerman \\"trained\\" them long, but the effect is absolutely unimaginable! In the samples you can hear, how they start each of the concertos. (To be honest, my favourite parts of Chopin's concerti have always been the orchestral exposition of the 1st movements with the first few minutes with the piano) Listen to it. E.g. the unusual beginning of the F minor: quiet, passionate... Then a mighty 'tutti' moment, and then it's moving, accelerating... THIS is the way it should be played! Other example: listen to the very 11-12th second of the beginning of the E minor. This might seem to be a detail at first, not worth mentioning... but how dead and boring seem immediately all other recordings! Here is the passion...  <br /> <br />Someone contemporary to Chopin said he was more Polish than any of Frenchmen was French or any of Germans - German... I don't know whether the opinion that the music of a composer is played best by his compatriots is true in all cases, but IMO it is in the case of Chopin - and these recordings confirm it.  <br /> <br />Don't care about people who complain about the lack of \\"spontaineity\\". There is no room for spontaineity where everything is perfect as is Chopin's head! <br /> <br />Buy these recordings. You cannot be disappointed.  <br /> <br />Thanks and sorry for my, perhaps wrong, English spelling or other errors :)  <br /> <br />P.S. Deutsche Grammo should pay me for advertisement. :)
B000002L68|5.0|Prince is an artist who polarizes most music fans.  To some, he is an unparalleled genius and even his apparent mis-steps are merely \\"beyond our scope\\" to understand.  Others are confused by  his sexuality, vulgarity or general behavior and find it more convenient to dismiss him as a overhyped wierdo.  I tend to think of him as a genius who sometimes makes bad music (and I don't toss around the g-word lightly), but it doesn't really matter.  Regardless of what you think of Prince personally, I can't imagine that anyone wouldn't recognize the monumental talent required to write and perform the songs on Purple Rain. <br /> <br />Barely a minute into \\"Let's Go Crazy\\", the tone is set.  This is Rock.  This is Funk. This is Pop.  This is something else entirely.  This is music with the cockiness and strut of an artist who is in full command of his considerable skills and knows it.  What follows is a journey that is more vibrant and dramatic than the movie that bears the same name.  Prince is demonstrating that he is beholden to no convention, but doesn't throw that fact in our faces.  When he makes a decision on this album, there is no ulterior motive to show off or be controversial.  His only purpose is to advance the \\"musical narrative\\".  The level with which he succeeds can only be matched, not surpassed. <br /> <br />Many people will point to Sign of the Times or 1999 as Prince's best effort, but neither of these albums boast a collection of songs that cling together so organically, or pulse with so much energy.  This is a soundtrack that renders the movie unnecessary.  Each new song unfolds like a fresh scene or chapter, evolving out of the previous music.  Check out the transitions between \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" and \\"Computer Blue\\" and \\"Darling Nikki\\", or the melding of \\"I Would Die 4 U\\" and \\"Baby I'm a Star\\".  Whether its the squeal of the purple one's gutiar or his voice, the conviction is clear.  He has committed fully to his work, and so will you. <br /> <br />Purple Rain is the rare album that is perfect to throw on at party, but also holds up through a pair of headphones with all of your focus on every note.  One of the top ten albums of all time.
B000BBYMA2|5.0|Battle Royale is a movie based on new age problems, such as teen suicide, school murders, and the lack of respect that today's youth has or has had for superiors. It's a surreal response to all of these elements of modern society (and despite being a Japanese film, this is especially true for the United States). In the near future, teenagers have decided that they don't want to follow the same rules they've been following for ages. Teachers now fear for their lives, and students boycott the system. In order to put a stop to this, the BR Act was instituted, yet none of the students have no idea about this... until they are apart of the Act. Basically, the BR Act allows the adults to send children and students off to a secluded island to kill each other off.<br /><br />That's just what happens to a class of forty-two students, with two mysterious transfer students included in that. Once introduced to their class, and given the rules of game, they are sent off with a bag of provisions and a randomly chosen weapon. Sometimes, the weapons can as useless as a pair of binoculars, or as effective as grenades. It's all the luck of the draw, and whether or not the student is able to adapt to the game and earn the weapons on their own. Some students do just that, while others choose different ways of escaping the game. And then there are those who choose instead not to fight at all, but to unite and try to figure out a way to save themselves. Yet the rules of the game may force even those of a more peaceful ilk to kill the ones they trust.<br /><br />What's good about Battle Royale is that, though there are numerous characters and plenty of sub-plots, it never gets bogged-down with an over-populated cast. There are heroes, neutral forces, as well as those who are pure evil. Another good part of this movie is the constantly rising tension, and how the characters react to this. As the game gets deeper, the characters emotions begin to fray. Though surely a fantasy, it seems that everything that happens to these students because of the BR Act could be possible, should our world ever reach the point it does in Battle Royale.<br /><br />The one problem I had with Battle Royale, though, was the subtitles. At times they ran out of the edge of the screen, making it impossible to read, and at other times they just weren't grammatical. The wrong words were used in many places, and sometimes the subtitles made no sense at all, whether they were written grammatically or not. Though the acting makes a lot of what's being said clear, there are times when this still gets frustrating.<br /><br />Despite that, though, the movie is excellent. It has plenty of surprises, a good ending, and a lot of great action. Plus, it has the common Japanese elements, like the super-violence and gore. To add, the story is great, and the characters are well-acted. I'd recommend this movie to any fan of Asian cinema, especially Japanese horror fans.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|If the title 'Confessions on a dance floor'  (a formulaic moniker plagued in the chick-lit genre) splashed on a book cover with a red-based primary colour - and trust me, it would be in sparkles and glitter - it would of been another piece of candy in the gumball machine.  But it would not be passed over.  We want to know how the chick fares this time and how close the boyfriend she gets, as a sign post of self-redemption, comes close to 'the one' we have in our minds.  (Guys - this is pretty much why we read them).  However, by employing this title to her latest album, Madge is not only playing to the whimsical affects it naturally supplies but a subtle exercise of self-examination on her part as well.  Loosely speaking, the entirety of the 'Confessions' album and what it invokes in the listener relying on what he/she brings to it, together, Madonna redeems her music and maybe even herself.  No doubt, 'Confessions' is a guilty pleasure but it's okay because Madge knows and she likes it too.  But not only that, she does it too and cleverly pokes fun while doing so.  Comparatively speaking, 'Confessions on a dance floor' is an almost excellent album in retro progression arcing over 'American Life'; 'Music'; 'Ray of Light'; and so on stopping at 'Immaculate Collection.'   On its own, 'Confessions' is a good album aside from 5 tracks ('Sorry'; 'Future Lovers'; 'I Love New York'; 'Isaac'; and 'Like it or Not') where there's no reason why they could of benefitted from the same effort of the other 7 of solid sound and lyrics save for, perhaps, extremely particular personal inclinations.  And I'm being charitable.  Aware as she is of the power of her branded self-image, Madonna turns our nights of sparkling anticipation that fell into our wells of a disappointed memory into an emotional candy, sell it back to our psyche, and make us long for more.  Only Madonna - and a relative few others come to mind - can make 'Confessions on a dance floor' and herself appear as a seamless partnership.  Because in order to turn the dance floor into a vehicle to her disposal, Madge makes amends with the institution that encapsulated her star before its release.  In the stratosphere that's keen on glittery bright lights and supersonic beats, `Confessions' makes a good attempt at illuminating the star when the music and the lights are turned off.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We saw some of the hype about the show during Christmas, but I do not like Sci-Fi so we rented it from Netflix.  It was such a good series that we are going to purchase the series tonight and thought we would add our 2 cents. <br /> <br />I thought that the series reminded me of Han Solo, which I know will probably upset many Sci-Fi fans, but I have a limited number of Sci-Fi shows to draw from.  I felt that it is similar to what I would expect if they had done a series on Han Solo before he met the Skywalkers.  Mal, the captain, is a smuggler of sorts, he thinks he is a bad guy, but his big heart gets in the way all of the time.  There are many scrapes in the series that he has to get himself and his crew out of and the dialog is humerous and the characters are developed quite well.  By the end of the series you find yourself almost day dreaming about the show and the characters and you just wish that there was something you could do to make the series come back on the air.  I hope that they do bring it back, but the realistic side of you says that the actors were all really good and the likelyhood that they have not moved on in their careers is highly unlikely.
B000053VAF|2.0|Well, yes: Here is a star-studded cast, and here are a few good jokes. I guess it fits the genre \\"dark comedy.\\" Maybe that's enough.  <br /> <br />And maybe it's not. It's not, if you mind that the trash outweighs the treasure. It's not if you don't find an enormous \\"excremental\\" poop-giant sent up from Hell to be hilariously funny. It's not if a valley boy (\\"Jay\\") begging for sex every two minutes doesn't seem clever.  <br /> <br />You might also find this movie grating if you have any respect for institutional religion, since the Catholic Church especially becomes an object of tasteless satire. Or if you don't really like gratuitous violence, because there is plenty here. Or if you think that such a frontal attack on religion might do better to have something more subtle going for it than the callow distinction between \\"beliefs\\" and \\"ideas\\" that is belatedly introduced here by the 13th apostle, stupidly named \\"Rufus,\\" and played by Chris Rock, whose talent truly is wasted on this lame film (along with the rest of the considerable cast). <br /> <br />In short, this is a precocious inside joke for Kevin Smith afficionados. The rest of the world would do well to tune out.
B00005U122|3.0|I felt this was a good concert on the whole, BUT... <br /> <br /> The odd thing to me was that some of the arrangements of classic Pink Floyd tracks were were excellent (Dogs and Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun were standouts) but others felt very flat (Shine On You Crazy Diamond was butchered) and missed the mark I felt. Now, the  guitar players were good, sure, but none of thim is Dave Gilmour, and I did get the impression they avoided getting TOO adventurous with some of the intricate riffs and chords that are all in  days' work for Gilmour. The solos on Money, for example, and Comfortably Numb, just lack the sheer brilliance and deep texture of Gilmour's playing on the 1995 \\"Pulse\\" live album. If it wasn't for Pulse, I'd call this Roger Waters show a masterpiece, but it comes over as rather thin compared to Pink Floyd's seminal concert. Now, when are they FINALLY bringing that one out on DVD? Roger Waters In The Flesh is merely a stop-gap to fill in for Pulse until it is released, in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Pink Floyd can get on just fine without Waters it seems, but Waters is a bit lacking without Floyd.
B000CPH9I4|5.0|There will probably be no radio pop hits from this record.  Still if you're a Corrs fan or a fan of traditional Irish music, this one is for you.  Long criticized for going pop and moving away from their Irish sound, this record will silence those critics once and for all.
B000CPH9I4|3.0|(3 & 1/2 stars)  After hearing about this new Corrs release being a return to traditional Irish music, I had been concerned that it would a pretty boring CD.  However, thanks to some good song arrangements and the siblings' excellent performances, Home ended up a mostly pleasing effort.  The singing on these songs is sweet as ever, and clearly heartfelt as a \\"labour of love.\\"  Some modern instrumentation does pop up now and then (unobtrusively), but what really gives these old tunes a new twist is how they are altered with different accompanying harmony lines - the piano is used in a particularly effective way - and even changing the melodies themselves.  The traditional aspect of the songs also comes through on occasion with some Uillean pipes, whistles, etc.<br /><br />Having said all of these favorable things about the Home CD, though, I must explain my slightly lower rating.  When I've listened to it (2.5 times so far), it has left me a little cold.  The songs are pretty and well made, it's just that nothing really stands out.  I think that the attempt to contemporize the music robbed it of a bit of its spirit, its fire.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|Other reviewers here state that the original shooting of \\"Dune\\" was to be quite long, around 6 hours.  The producers decided to cut it to the classic Lynch \\"Theatrical Version\\" which is just over 2 hours (2 hrs., 17 min.).  Obviously, a lot got left on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />  This DVD features the Theatrical Version on one side, and the Extended Version on the other.  I had never seen the Extended Version, which runs 2 hours 57 minutes--an additional 40 minutes of scenes that the general public never got to see.<br /><br />  For those who are unfamiliar with the Dune story, this is the original movie version of the famous novel of the same name by Frank Herbert.  It takes place in the year 10,191--in the far future where mankind has established itself on many worlds throughout the Galaxy.  The Dune future is utterly unlike our own present.  This is the story of the conflict between several \\"Great Houses\\" (planetary nations) and other powerful forces within the Galactic Imperium for control of the planet Dune, which is the only source of the spice Melange.  Melange is essential to space travel, since only it can allow space navigators to safely pilot a starship from one world to another.  An obvious analogy to oil in our own time, which provides the fuel for today's industrial society.<br /><br />  The extended version is both the same and different.  Instead of being narrated by Princess Irulan, there is a gravelly masculine voice that narrates, in somewhat more detail than in the Theatrical Version.  In fact, the Extended Version starts off with a \\"prolog\\" where there are sketches and narration that essentially describes a bit about the Dune Universe, including the Great Revolt against the Thinking Machines and the basic nature of the Imperium.  This prolog was startling--I had no idea that such a prolog had been created and then discarded.  Many scenes with which we are all familiar suddenly sport extra dialogue and more elaboration.  But of course, it is the same story.<br /><br />  Any Dune lover will want to own this DVD, if for no other reason, the price is right, and there is a lot here.  You get the Theatrical Version, Extended Version, and some additional deleted scenes and other special features.  Overall, I like the Extended Version better, but I can see why they had to shorten the film for theater viewers.  (This is why I personally prefer to watch DVDs at home rather than go to the flickers.) I will say that the narration, in the Theatrical Version, by the actress who plays Princess Irulan was wildly better than the harsh voice who narrates in the Extended Version.<br /><br />Like many others who like the Dune story, I have waited for this one for a very long time. A good value and an enjoyable viewing experience.rse, it is the same story. <br /> <br />  Any Dune lover will want to own this DVD, if for no other reason, the price is right, and there is a lot here.

0694013889|1.0|It is way too expensive for what you pay for.  The video is very short and I can't stand that they call it Wee Wee and Poo Poo.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|I wanted to give this 2 stars but there were SOME things I liked about it.<br /><br />This movie has received so much praise since it came out and I'm a little curious about it. Why? Is it because the movies that were made this year were mostly bad and mostly remakes and unoriginal. Probably.<br /><br />The truth is, in my opinion, that the movie is basically the same as the original with a few exception. This one is more true to the book... including the scene about where the Oompa Loompa's came from and how they came to be workers at Wonkas factory and showing more of the Wonka and Charlie relationship after the day long adventure in the chocolate factory. We get to meet Wonka's father and find out why he became so obsessed with candy. This is why I liked the movie.<br /><br />I didn't like the movie because it was the same as the original except longer... with the added scenes. Everything played out the same... like a horror movie... one kid down... two kids down... three kids down... etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />The original Willie Wonka was a classic and Gene Wilder played the character with sadness, madness, wildness, sass, sarcasm and mystery. Johnny Depp didn't really do any of this... maybe sadness and then he added creepiness. I think that was the main thing I missed from the original. You loved Gene Wilder's Wonka because he was funny and sarcastic and quick-witted. Johnny Depp's Wonka was like... well... sort of sarcastic, but creepy and spoke pretty much the exact same way that Depp did in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS... with a mousy squeaky voice.<br /><br />I missed Gene Wilder's sarcastic and unenthusiastic, \\"oh no. what are we gonna do? How will we ever go on without him?\\" as Augustus Gloop tried to swim in his river of chocolate.<br /><br />I also missed the Oompa Loompa song. Wow. That song was such a fixture in my memory. \\"Oompa Loompa... oompadeedoo...\\" The new songs...??? I couldn't remember them right now if you payed me. Sorry Danny Elfman. You're fantastic... but you can't mess with a classic.<br /><br />Charlie and the Chocolate factory in a lot of ways is better than the original, but the original was so perfect in so many ways... it will always be the better movie to me. Had the original been more fairy tale and included the missing scenes that Charlie and the Chocolate factory included... there would have been no need to remake it...<br /><br />...I got another riddle for you... Why do they remake classics like this... when they can remake one of the many potentially good movies that were a boo hiss?arlie and the Chocolate factory in a lot of ways is better than the original, but the original was so perfect in so many ways... it will always be the better movie to me.

B000957O7S|5.0|An excellent Valentine's Day movie or gift! Will Smith is fantastic as Alex Hitchens a nerd turned matchmaker. However not just any matchmaker, but the best one in New York City it seems.<br /><br />This apparently pays well judging from the size of Alex's apartment.  The Date Doctor as Will's character is known helps super-geek Albert Brennaman (Kevin James) sweep Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta) off of her feet. The beautiful and funny Eva Mendes plays gossip columnist Sara Melas, the object of Alex's attention and love. But things don't always go as planned even for the great Hitch! But it is definitely entertaining along the way.<br /><br />The research and work that goes in the movie is apparent and pays off giving the movie a classic and timeless appeal. The world oldest subject LOVE is what drives the comedy and the touching moments in the movie. Even in today's super cynical world the message comes through loud and clear: Love conquers all.<br /><br />Kudos to Will Smith's wardrobe consultant (Marlene Stewart) she does an excellent job. A must see movie and definitely worth 5 stars.<br /><br />Oh! And I almost forgot Kevin James (The King of Queens) does the funniest dancing I have ever seen. My wife and I were in tears laughing and I bet you will be also.
0131103628|5.0|This is probably the best book on C that was ever written.  It's designed for people who know how to program and want to learn the C language very quickly.  This book delivers exactly that.  If you are already relatively familiar with the concepts of programming, then you will be able to pick this book up and learn C rapidly.  Not only that, you'll be learning it from one of the people who designed the language (Dennis Ritchie), so there is no room for error in this book.  I highyly recommend it!
B000DN5W4I|4.0|I've seen Joe perform perhaps 4 or 5 times and I booked him to one show.  I just got done reviewing a pre-production version of the DVD and I think it gives a good feel for what to expect at a Joe Bonamassa concert.  If you've found this DVD then you probably are already a fan of his.  I won't go too deep into his music style other than to say that if you like Stevie Ray Vaughan or Kenny Wayne Sheperd you'll like Joe. <br /> <br />The DVD's audio is stereo which is unfortunate because a Dolby Digital surround mix would have really enhanced the 'you are there' feel of the event.  As for the video, the editing is solid and the image is clear and well-focused.  The lighting is dark and has a bluish and reddish tint because of the stage lighting but that's what you get with a video of a live concert-hall rock gig. <br /> <br />Most of the songs are typical of a JB concert except that I have not heard him perform Burning Hell live before.  I considered that to be a treat. <br /> <br />I'm enthusiastic about this DVD and I think the only thing that would have made it better would have been a 5.1 mix.
B000002I25|5.0|This is quite simply one of those albums that puts the \\"classic\\" in classic rock, and truly one of the best debuts in history. Every day their are people listening to this album for the first time and going \\"wow\\"! I really like every one of their albums, but I can safely say that 9 of 10 fans would call this one the best. 8 of these 11 songs made the last \\"Hits\\" collection this is so good. I would have added 9. I'll say no more, but since the tracklist is currently missing here, I'll list it: Break On Through (to the other side), Soul Kitchen, The Crystal Ship, Twentieth Century Fox, Alabama Song (whisky bar), Light My Fire, Back Door Man, I Looked At You, End Of The Night, Take It As It Comes, and The End. A must.
0316172324|2.0|Here's a glimpse from the recent NYT article: The Gladwell Effect. \\"For all their resonance and success, Gladwell's books have also been criticized, most often for demonstrating, or encouraging, lazy thinking. In a scathing review in The New Republic, the judge and author Richard Posner found \\"Blink\\" full of banalities and contradictions, \\"written like a book intended for people who do not read books.\\" Some social scientists have also been unimpressed. \\"I think what he leaves people with is not that scientists are doing some interesting work, but that Malcolm Gladwell has a couple of good ideas,\\" said Thomas Schelling, who shared last year's Nobel in economic science and did pioneering research on the \\"tipping point,\\" a formulation that originally referred to the point at which white families would leave a neighborhood after black families began moving in.\\" <br /> <br />The introduction points out that college students know in the first second how well they will like a teacher. And this is a good thing?! Someone is writing an apt take off: Blank: The Power of Not Thinking at All... <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. It was very very rushed, as I suppose you can understand a movie length version of Pride & Prejudice would be and I felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story.     As the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all.     Not only that, this movie is Boring. 1/3 of the way through I started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over. When they finally met in the field at the end, couldn't care less if they got together or not. As I have read the book and watch the BBC version, I knew how many scenes had to go, before I could finally leave the cinema. Mr Darcy whoever he is in this movie, definitely can't act. He looks also too young to play Mr Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed like he needs to get through the script or something. Where is the build up? At first, he seems confused with everything. He is just bizarre! It all looks put on.     Was trying not to compare to the Colin Firth version but if you love that version, you will most likely be disappointed anyway.    The costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I think she still knows how to dress as some sort of ladylike fashion, and hasn't been brought up in a squaller. Her dresses indicates she might be the poorest peasant in all of England walking around in nothing more than brown rags. Is that what Jane Austen had in mind?    I didn't agree with a couple of scenes in the movie in the fact, that I don't think it would be considered proper in that society for men to do such things, i.e for Darcy to walk in (without knocking on the front door - I might add) - in the middle of the night to see Elizabeth and give her a letter??? If he was a gentleman, very unlikely. Secondly, Mr Bingley just walking into Jane's room while she is sick to see if she is okay? Doesn't he have any sense of propriety? Mr Bingley who has wealth and hopefully sense should know better.     There is some things that are said that sound too modern for the period this movie is set in, and not at all like Jane Austen. Bingley's character is shockingly done, to me he behaves like a simpleton, not a character to like and respect. Mr Bingley to me was always suppose to be likeable. To me, he is on the same lineage that we would view Mr Collins. What about that laugh of his!!! Wickham hardly has a presence so you don't get to feel at all for the lead up to Lydia taking off with him and Mr & Mrs Hurst and a couple of other characters have no presence at all. Everything feels in sequence but not a smooth flow - feels very jumpy.     Didn't see or feel the chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy.     Okay I am a fan of the other but was willing to give this a go and knew there would be differences. I guess my biggest disappointment is the portrayal of Darcy and Bingley. Bingley and Jane seemed like a bizarre couple to be getting attached. I didn't think the way they portrayed Bingley would be the type of person that the Jane they portrayed would go for. Again - chemistry?? Questionable.    The ending - where is it?? What a bizarre way to end it.
0143057375|5.0|This work, A New Earth, supercedes all of Tolle's previous writings.  It has better and clearer explanations and is replete with examples which are packed with a great density of meaning. That means you will inevitably \\"upack\\" more and more meaning from these ideas each time you read them. Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, but, to me this book is an enduring treaure.  I hope millions read it and take away from it whatever they can carry.<br /><br />Dr. Paul Tuthill
B000002O3I|5.0|Let's get my only gripes out of the way now--a drunk monkey could've come up with better packaging than what comes with this 2-albums-in-one set. The cover art is sloppily integrated and cheap, the albums are oddly in reverse chronological order (the self-titled album was released in 1962, Moanin' In The Moonlight in 1959), the liner notes are minimal given Chester Burnett A.K.A. Howlin' Wolf's importance to modern blues and the sound quality is so-so (Chess offers a remastered single disc titled His Best, if this bothers you). They even left off a track due to what they claim is CD length limitations, which is B.S. since the whole thing is under 70 minutes and most of the existing tracks are under three. Who are they trying to kid?<br /><br />Other than that, this is SEMINAL electric blues from one of the best in the business. Wolf is quite simply the finest blues vocalist ever--his gravelly, soulful, cavernous growl is unmistakable and awesome, befitting a man of such huge girth and power (listen to the microphone nearly detonate on the beginning of Moanin' In The Moonlight from trying to handle his voice). His lyrics exude passion and grit, but not without a touch of humor--this is blues to party to. The band behind him is equally potent, with Hubert Sumlin's iconic riffs and Willie Dixon's bass playing and songwriting acumen.<br /><br />Every song from the self-titled is a classic--the boogie-blues of Shake For Me, innuendo-drenched Little Red Rooster, party stomper Wang Dang Doodle, slow-burning and funny Goin' Down Slow, and the catchy backbeat of Down From The Bottom being my favorites. Moanin' In The Moonlight isn't quite as memorable, but it too has its share of historical blues singles such as How Many More Years, Smokestack Lightnin', Forty Four, and the Dixon-penned Evil.<br /><br />This is the real stuff, and an essential buy. Let's just hope this package gets updated for a new generation.
B0007PALSE|2.0|Okay, when the best acting in the movie comes from a robot, you know something's not right. In this futuristic (yawn) movie, Det. Spooner is investigating the death of a roboticist, Dr. Lanning. He finds a protocol NS-5 robot, Sonny in the doctor's room and being the robo-hater that he is...immediately blames Sonny for the murder. Of course, Sonny being the cool, kick-ass robot that HE is, escapes. Spooner, with the help of robot psychologist Susan have to track down Sonny and get to the root of the \\"who-dunnit\\" mystery. Oh yeah, robots in the future are programmed with these 3 laws: <br /> <br />1) They can't hurt humans. <br />2) They have to follow whatever the hell the human tells them unless it conflicts with Rule 1. <br />3) Robots will do anything to protect themselves unless it conflicts with Rule 1. <br /> <br />So, there lies the problem. How could the NS-5 unit have killed Dr. Lanning. <br /> <br />I have to say, although I LOVE sci-fi movies...it's a tricky genre to tackle. Overdoing it, and it becomes silly. Not doing enough would make it bland. Plus it has to be original. In I, Robot...I felt like I was watching a mixture of other sci-fi movies particularly Minority Report (which I totally DUG, and have watched it about 10 times). And the sad thing was, the concept behind this movie was pretty interesting (credit to Asimov for that) but of course as soon as they Hollywood-ized it, the movie falls apart. The story is SO typical, it offers nothing new. Det. Spooner is the rogue detective, the \\"thinking out of the box-crazy type\\" that 10 minutes into the movie, you know that in the end he's gonna be right, and he's gonna go back to his captain (or whatever) and say \\"a-ha, in your face\\". While the robot, Sonny was definitely interesting, it didn't really lead to anything groundbreaking. Apart from that, we have the reluctant but noble heroin, the guy who's trying so hard to be bad that you know he's not the culprit, and a whole lotta unoriginal stuff. To me, this is why the movie failed. As I said, it had an interesting premise but it just doesn't get explored in the way I would've liked it to. <br /> <br />The acting is so-so. Will Smith is really starting to irritate me. After his fantastic performances in movies like Independance Day, Enemy Of The State and Men In Black (1, not 2), now he just seems content to look buff and deliver lame lines. More than once, I felt like punching the heck out of him. I know, he didn't have much to work on anyway, thanks to such a dry script, but I still felt he was really miscast here. Bridget Moynahan delivers a mediocre performance, there seemed to be no chemistry whatsoever between her and Spooner, she looked like she was acting with a gun to her head. The rest of the cast do an alright job, probably because they've seen the same thing in a hundred other movies. <br /> <br />The saving grace for this movie has got to be the visual effects. There were many scenes with the robots that literally took my breath away. It's amazing how far CG has advanced in movies. Everytime Sonny appears on screen, he steals the limelight. His moves and facial expressions outperforms the humans anytime. Even when he speaks, his voice seem to reflect his emotions, which caused the hoo-ha because robots are not supposed to have emotions. I thought this was done very well, and to be honest kept me watching until the end. <br /> <br />In short, save your money...watch this on cable or rent the DVD coz it's really not worth getting. The storyline leaves much to be desired. The acting is less than satisfactory. You're much better off watching sci-fi greats like The Matrix or Blade Runner. Now, if you'll excuse me...I'm gonna watch Minority Report for the 11th time.
B00005JNTX|1.0|Pay attention to the other viewer reviews, positive and negative.  They're telling a pretty consistent story.  There is little in the way of \\"art\\" here.  Unfortunately, I was suckered in by the professional reviews.  This is violence for violence's sake.  Pretty much period.  The acting is wooden, the script is lame, and there's no message to speak of.  But if what you're looking for is over-the-top violence, this is the movie for you (and possibly even the \\"GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE\\").  Oh, there are also a plentiful number of scantily clad or partially unclad young, attractive women.  And as the other reviews make clear, much of the violence is explicitly within the context of sex (or the sex business, or as a substitute for sex, or...).  Some of it was pretty disturbing.  Or it would have been if the visuals weren't done in the spirit of the original comic book rather than real life (oh, I'm sorry, \\"graphic novel\\").  Of course, that's the main drawing point of the movie, the linkage of violence and sex.  As repellant as I found this movie to be, they did do a excellent job of sticking to their main point.  I found it pretty darn misogynistic really, but it just may be your cup of tea.  Of course, the black and white visuals with splashes of color was an interesting approach, but not worth sitting through the movie for.  I would like to give this zero stars but the system won't let me.
6305313687|5.0|I have heard great things about this movie. My friends raved about it. Critics loved it. And I have always been a fan of Edward Norton. However it was just until recently that I managed to catch this movie, and I was blown away. I was expecting something good, but no way as shocking and powerful as this. <br /> <br />Derek was charged with murdering 2 black guys, who were trying to steal his car. He is currently doing time in prison and we are given glimpses of his life before entering prison. He is an influential member of the skinheads. They are a racist group and believe that whites have the sole rights to flourish in the U.S. We are also shown some of the hate crimes committed by Derek and his gang as well as life in prison. These are all in short cuts until they show Derek out of prison and how he sees things differently from then on. <br /> <br />First of all, I have to say bravo to the writers and the film makers for making such a bold movie. Whatever movie that deals with racism pales in comparison to this. Derek is not a mindless fool following the crowd. He has his views, his opinions about various problems the country is facing, and scary as this may sound...some of them actually makes sense. That is how profound the dialogue is. One scene in particular showcases this, a scene where the family is having dinner. Derek's mother has a friend over, Murray and they don't share his believes. They are shocked to find Derek has such hatred toward the minorities. Derek delivers some of the best lines in this scene, that you are left wondering...have you ever shared his views? If you did, does that make you a bad person? Is is true what Derek is saying, and if it is...is it fair? These are some of the questions I was left with, watching this movie. <br /> <br />As good as the script is, this movie would be nothing without Edward Norton's electrifying performance. Sure, the supporting cast did a fantastic job as well, especially Edward Furlong who played Derek's brother, Danny in the movie. But this movie is undeniably Norton's. I believe that the late 90's was the pinnacle of Norton's success. He gave a superb performance in Primal Fear in 1996, followed by this in 1998 and ending the millennium with outstanding acting in Fight Club in 1999. Here, the character he plays is larger than life. He has the power to change people's perception on crimes and racial views. Putting on 30 pounds of muscle for this role, he has never looked bigger and badder than this. Every move he makes seem to accentuate hate. He feels disgusted with what his neighbourhood has become and he decides to take matters on his own hand, and do something about it. It's just that his believes have been skewed by his father, and without much self control, he spirals down to committing hate crimes. Derek is a bad-a$$ and Norton captures it perfectly. Yet, after prison...Derek experiences something completely different. He has feelings of regret over his past life. He has repent, yet can his sins really be forgiven by him not indulging himself in hate crimes? His brother is headed down the same path and the people who he recruited are now angry with him for leaving that life, they see him as an enemy. How Norton transforms himself to reflect this is really amazing. From a confident, \\"don't give a f*ck\\" attitude, he is reduced to a broken man. He feels remorse but at the same time doesn't want to shoulder the responsibility of educating his friends the wrong of his ways. He knows it won't sit well with them. This leads to the movie's final scene which suffice to say, might not really have shocked you but will leave you feeling a mixed of emotions. <br /> <br />Good movies entertain, but great movies affect you on a personal level. This is an example of the later. This movie is not for everyone, but for those who are open minded and willing to take the leap, you won't be disappointed. Terrific script and brilliant acting makes this one of my favorite movies. Highly recommended!
B000AWYOGE|5.0|When beautiful Dahlia (Jennifer Connolly) goes through an ugly divorce and custody battle with ex-husband Kyle (Dougray Scott) over their daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade), she decides to move to Roosevelt Island in order to live closer to the best school for their daughter.  Kyle doesn't care for Dahlia's decision but is unable to stop her from moving into a horrid and weirdly disturbing rent-controlled apartment complex, sprawling and psychologically dark.<br /><br />John C. Reilly plays landlord Mr. Murray, an overzealous and officious man who prefers to avoid problems with the large complex once pushing the hard sell to its tenants.  He repeatedly passes off Dahlia's problems to the building's super, Mr. Veeck (played by Pete Postlehwaite), a cantankerous old man without an ounce of friendliness and more than a little odd.<br /><br />In Dahlia's tiny, dilapidated apartment, in spite of recent paint and both Veeck and Murray's promise of considerable work done, the ceiling in the bedroom begins leaking dark and murky water.  Veeck blames it on two juvenile delinquents who break into the empty apartment above and vandalize it.  Then Ceci's new teacher (played by Camryn Manheim) informs Dahlia that Ceci has an 'imaginary friend' and is becoming antisocial within the classroom.<br /><br />Ceci's behavior inside the darkly unsettling complex becomes more and more bizarre, leading Dahlia to discover an unlocked door to a roof without a railing and a rusted water tower menacing the filthy rooftop.  Dahlia starts to wonder why she is having dark dreams, dreams of her own childhood, and why Ceci is infatuated with 'Nastasha', the girl who lives upstairs.<br /><br />But the apartment upstairs is empty and flooded with gruesomely fetid water, the same water leaking into Dahlia's apartment, so Dahlia forces Veeck to tell her the truth about the absent family from above.<br /><br />'Dark Water' is a very good psychological thriller.  The performances of Jennifer Connolly and Dougray Scott (two of my favorites), along with Pete Postlethwaite, Camryn Manheim, and John C. Reilly are exceptional, their talents bringing justice to the dilapidated and unforgiving eeriness of the apartment complex.<br /><br />The nastiness of the unclean water is presented so expertly that I could actually smell its foulness.  Dahlia's slide into depression and anxiety is very well portrayed as she questions her own sanity in the mess that has enveloped her and Ceci's lives.  The overall creepiness of this movie definitely deserves five stars, along with the photography, script, editing, and director Walter Salles.<br /><br />'Dark Water' is not the fast paced gore-fest us horror aficionado's enjoy, but the stealthy and creeping terror of unstable minds, decrepit architecture, a slow slide into madness, and the unworldly forces of the dead pushing their way into our lives.  A nice surprise awaits you at the film's conclusion, also.  I definitely believe this movie is worth a purchase.

B00000K2UX|5.0|As a kid I have always loved eighties films like Top gun, flight of the navigator etc but the soundtrack for this film has always stood out. Full of eighties power rock, and the old movie soundtrack favourite(Kenny Loggins), it just takes you back to that time when everything celluoid was so much better back then. <br /> <br />Danger zone is sometimes the only reason why I would watch the film, the opening titles come on with the the atmospheric Faltermeyer score then danger zone blares out. Turn the dvd system right up........awesome!! <br /> <br />Playing with the boys is always fun to listen to, especially accompanied by a greased up Val Kilmer and midget jem tom cruise. <br /> <br />One of my favourite songs will always be sitting on the dock of the bay by otis redding and was so glad when they included it in the bonus tracks. <br />Take my breath away will always remind me of the cheesist love scene I have ever seen, its the only let down of the film. all billowing curtains and soft lighting. <br /> <br />Everyone who was young during that time and whom love the film should own this soundtrack. Its just the best <br /> <br />
B0009WFFS6|5.0|First of all, I would advise level-headed readers to ignore the one-star extremists.  These people are so cynical that if Jesus Christ Himself were to make a comeback in their living rooms, they would scorn Him as a sellout because He wasn't still wearing the original crown of thorns. <br /> <br />Frankly, I don't care why Cream decided to make this concert happen - I'm just overwhelmed with gratitude that they did it before one of them left us.  Let's get real.  These three men are closing in on 70, and they have absolutely no right to play as well, sing as beautifully or sound as incredible as they do on this DVD.  Basically, what you have here are three grandfathers playing a young man's hard driving blues, and doing a d**n fine job.  In the music business, perhaps only B.B. King, Ray Charles, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash have worn their years as magnificently as Eric, Jack and Ginger do here. <br /> <br />This isn't a \\"comeback\\" or a \\"reunion,\\" despite what the DVD credits would have us believe.  Musically, this is a continuation, a new chapter in the annals of Cream.  Yes, they play most of their original hits, and yes there are (many) moments when you'll hear the young men they once were coming out in their voices and in their playing.  But a perfect recreation of their 1968 sound is not what this concert is about. <br /> <br />Instead, this is like classical pianist Glen Gould's \\"Book End\\" recordings of the Goldberg Variations.  He recorded them first in his 20's and then again in his 70's.  The songs are the same, the brilliance is the same; the interpretations are subtly but powerfully different, as one would expect from a man who has gathered fifty years of life experience between them. <br /> <br />Any attempt by Cream to exactly reproduce their sound from 1968 for the May 2005 R.A.H. concert would have turned this into a sad caricature, in the same way that it would have been pathetic for them to have grown out their hair and squeezed into polyester bell bottoms.  As Jack says in one of the interviews, \\"We didn't want to become a tribute band to ourselves; that would have been awful.\\"  I couldn't agree more, and if we want to experience Cream circa 1968, that's what \\"Fresh Live Cream,\\" \\"Cream Farewell Concert\\" and \\"Cream Live Vols 1 & 2\\" are for. <br /> <br />Instead, what this DVD gives us is a miraculous concert by three of the greatest musicians ever to pick up the fundamental classic rock instruments.  The songs are familiar, and so is the general sound, but the music itself is new in a way that is magnificent. <br /> <br />As for the production:  The sound quality is flawless, the video is perfect, the camera angles are occasionally irritating but often quite good, and the band is tastefully presented alone on stage with no backup musicians or overdubbing.  While I would have enjoyed seeing more extra materials on the 2nd DVD, such as an interview with all three at the same time and some vintage film footage, what we get in the whole set is still worth several times the selling price. <br /> <br />Real fans of this trio will be overwhelmed and overjoyed to experience what they have given us on this DVD.  They were purists then, and they are purists now.
B0007XT87G|5.0|It's true, nobody on my side of the pond seems to know about Poucupine Tree.  Hopefully this album will begin to increase thier noteriety.  It is a spectacular work.  While it is not as heavy as parts of In Absentia were, it is a remarkable album.  The opening track showcases everything I love about Porcupine Tree and then some.  It has the synth and drums in the background driving the song, some great guitar work, and the stellar, complex lyric writing that Porcupine Tree has become known for.    It doesn't hurt that it also has Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt as a guest vocalist.  The charming and beautiful piano melody of \\"Lazarus\\" will worm its way into your heart after a few listens.  The master work of the album however is the 12-minute epic \\"Arriving Somewhere but not Here.\\"  Words cannot appropriately describe it.  It is the essence of the band, collapsed into one song in one song.  \\"Mellotron Scratch\\" is another mellow track that throws back to the earlier days of the band, back to the tranceier recordings.  Once you push play with this album, you will find it very difficult to remove from your CD player.   <br />     <br />Do yourself a favor.  Buy this album now and tell a few friends about it too.  It is one of the best albums of 2005, as well as being a career highlight for the band.  I would recommend Deadwing to someone unfamiliar with the band as the first album to buy.  Diehard fans need not read this review, as they should already have it.  Like I said, Porcupine Tree deserves more recognition in the States than they get.  Spread the word about this remarkable band.
0446310786|5.0|I first read this classic novel during my eighth grade year of junior high. Although I loved the book the first time I read it, I recently decided to pick it up and read it again for fun. Today, I am a high school chemistry teacher in a struggling school on the southside of Chicago. In light of both the education I have received since I last read the book and my experience with the wonderful students I wok with on a daily basis, I now realize that I missed much of the book's significance and wisdom my first time around.  <br />Whether you grow up in the suburbs, the country, or in an urban metropolis, the lessons of love, race, class, justice, and personal growth contained within the pages of To Kill a Mockingbird are invaluable to an individual's growth and development as a citizen of a our diverse democracy. The story narrates the events that occurred in the lives of a sister and brother, Scout and Jem Finch, over a time period of three years. Told through the viewpoint of an innocent child, Scout, the tale brings to life a town's struggle with racism. The book also brilliantly exposes the complex varieties of good and evil that exist within each of us.  <br />In Lee's tale, Scout's father and brilliant lawyer, Atticus Finch, defends a black man, Tom Robinson, wrongly accused of raping a white woman. Atticus's pursuit for honesty and truth demonstrates to all the importance of standing up and fighting for what is right. Without the individuals like Atticus Finch that have lived throughout our nation's history, we would not have the freedom we often take for granted.  <br />This novel is essential to the education of all children. It helps them understand the historical background behind of the social problems that still exist within our society today and, hopefully, inspires our youth to take an objective look at these problems and work to discover effective solutions to them.
0375751513|5.0|This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read.  There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment.  The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one.  I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian.  While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality.  Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence.  Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic.  Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out.
B00004UEE5|4.0|Daniel Barenboim didn't record too many Mahler works until today, we have to mention a wonderful recording of Des Knaben Wunderhorn with Dieskau and the Berliner Philharmoniker (Sony), a quite good Das Lied von der Erde with Chicago (Erato) and some lieder with Meier and the Orchestre de Paris (Erato). <br /> <br />I've listened Daniel Barenboim conducting Mahler, in the Teatro Real, in Madrid, where he conducted some years ago Mahler's First Symphony to the Berliner Staatskapelle, a really remarkable concert, one of the best I've ever been. Probably Mahler's music is not so close to Barenboim like Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner or some other great composer from the romantic period, and specially from the German tradition. Anyway, Barenboim's great conducting makes a remarkable Mahler, as I have listened live and in his recordings. <br /> <br />This Mahler's Fifth is a very good performance of a master piece, one of my favourite symphonic works. I have to say I prefer other versions on CD, like Riccardo Chailly's one (Decca) specially, or Bernstein's one (DG, CD or DVD), Abbado with Chicago (DG), even Haitink with Berlin offers an interesting interpretation. Barenboim's one is good, based on a magnificent orchestra that responds like a machine to the very high difficulties of this score. First and second movements always use to be very good played by this orchestra (like Abbado showed) and this time they make it very well one more time. The Scherzo is wonderfully played by the first horn of the CSO, Mr. Clevenger, a really outstanding player. Adagietto is smooth and full of charm, very sensitive and sensible to what the piece means. The Rondo Finale is very good too, with the Chicago Machine playing full of energy in the final fanfares. Some people have mentioned CSO brasses specially, I've to say that I love them but much more for repertoires like Shostakovich, Bruckner, Mahler or Bartk. Mahler's very sensitive music ask for a fine playing that sometimes I miss, sometimes, not always, in the very aggressive and hard Chicago brasses playing. <br /> <br />The sound is very good and the film too, taken in Kln (Germany), the same you can listen on CD in Teldec label.  <br /> <br />Together with Bernstein (DG), the Mahler's Fifth I found more interesting on DVD, even more than Rattle's one with Berlin (EMI). <br />
0684857219|5.0|This is a fantastic book; probably the best of its kind.  Please don't be discouraged by those who insist Arnold's success is solely because of steriods.  Arnold openly admits he used steroids, but at the time they were perfectly legal.  There are a lot of athletes who used steroids that didn't look anything like Arnold!  Arnold has decades of weightlifting/bodybuilding experience, seven Mr. Olympia titles, and has trained with hundreds of the best athletes on the planet.  If he is not qualified to speak about effective training programs, no one is!  You can put a scientific designation behind your name, or call yourself a trainer, but there is no substitute to getting in the gym and lifting those plates.  Buy this book, read it, and put it to use.  You won't be disappointed.
B00030EIXW|5.0|This is a very long waited DVD by all those who knew the Laser Disc with this same performances filmed live in the Dutch Concertgebouw in the `80s. <br /> <br />First of all we have to mention the very close relation that exist between Carlos Kleiber and Beethoven's world, specially with the Seventh Symphony he have conducted lot of times. We knew his audio recording with the Wiener Philharmoniker for Deutsche Grammophon, one of the most interesting I know, but not really so good like this, much more fresh and well done. Of course, the Wiener is an orchestra I like a little more than the Concertgebouworkest, but the Dutch one is good enough to play a fantastic concert like this, in which is easy to see everything was deeply rehearsed and prepared before going to the stage. Sometimes Kleiber even is `dancing' with the orchestra and enjoining the results of all the previous work. The tempi are fresh and light, pure Kleiber style and the sound is, like everybody use to describe, `electrifying', very passionate. Wagner said this Beethoven's Seventh is the `apotheosis of the dance' and we can say Kleiber really does it, dancing even himself with his body and swinging his baton. Probably my favourite Seventh together with very good one of Szell & Cleveland (Sony). <br /> <br />Sound is quite good, not excellent but good enough to be an `80s recording by Philips. You will need to rise the volume quite high but the clearness, balance and definition is good. The image is very good to, joining shots of Kleiber, the orchestra and the Concertgebouw hall, a really fantastic place in which public, enthusiastic, embrace the orchestra. <br /> <br />The orchestra is the smooth and very technical Concertgebouworkest, not always very fine in Beethoven (perfect in Mahler and other repertoires, even form the XXth Century Music), but with a great day here, what a woodwinds! <br /> <br />The Fourth is quite good too, but not so great like the Seventh. In this Fourth Symphony I really prefer Bernstein's performance with the Wiener Philharmoniker (DG). <br /> <br />If I'm realistic, the media of the performances would be 4 and some decimals, but as we are watching a wonderful piece of history and listening a wonderful player, it will be five. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br />
0345423496|1.0|I've been a fan of Clarke for decades, but this book is the least exciting, least interesting, least everything he has ever done. The story is mundane and predictable and without any of the facination that held my interest in earlier books. This book opens at a low level of interest and maintains it throughout. <br /> <br />Clarke uses this book as a soapbox for insulting anyone of faith (calling them \\"Un-Sane\\"). After his last few books I swore I would not read anything else he published - I should have kept my word. <br /> <br />There are many better ways to spend your time than to read this book - trimming your nails, waiting in line for a movie, and going to the dentist are just a few.
B000062YB1|5.0|This has been reviewed to... death, but I wanted to point out that the song Expendable Youth is a fine song that is a good crossover for people who are just having first exposure to Slayer.  That song is catchy to me and still beats Enter Sandwichman to a pulp.  The title track is of epic proportions, Dead Skin Mask is a good Hanibal Lekter type plot with a South of Heaven type feel. <br /> <br />The whole album may be the peak of their maturity, whereas Reign in Blood and South may jointly be the peak of their initial hostility.
0895260131|1.0|wow.  <br />why would you get your heart checked by a foot doctor. <br />why would you get info about Islam from Robert Spencer. <br />Blows ones mind away.  <br /> <br />Islam is a universal religion to unite people of the world regardless of their beliefs, color, ethnicity, wealth or health. <br />slavery, bigotry is banned in Islam. All are created equal in Islam. unlike our recent history in U.S, blacks and whites have the same value in eyes of God. and yes Allah means God. God of all monotheist. God of Abraham, God of Moses and God of Jesus. <br /> <br />no mention in this book that Islam was spread throughout Europe and Asia and Africa because people accepted it, and not by sword as the author would like you to believe. There are tens and thousands of people across the world, including U.S accepting and embracing Islam. who is putting the gun to their heads. No mention here how Islam brought medicine, mathematics, philosophical thinking to Europe and Asia. No mention here that in Islam Jews and Christians are held at the highest regard (as people of the book).  No mention here, that a Kafir (infidel) does not mean a Jew or a Christian. <br />It means one who knows the truth of God's presence, but is preaching against it. Kafir literally means in Arabic to cover. <br /> <br />No mention here that there is no Arabic term for \\"holy war\\". <br />There is no such thing. No war can be holy. The author purposely confuses the reader and does not mention that Jihad has two meanings: <br />1)struggle to be the your possible best intellectually, spiritually, socially <br />2)and in order to be at your best you must be at good standing, another words you must <br />defend yourself from bad things and people - Self Defence <br /> <br />How can one be at their possible best when they wage war? <br />Hence, author is misleading. <br />He forgets to mention that Jihad is justifiable ONLY when its self defense. That is a fact please check it. <br />The word faith has a synonymin Arabic and its called Iman. <br />The literal meaning for Iman is to learn. <br />Another words Islam is 100% against blind faith and hence coercion. please see [...] <br /> <br />One has to ask! what is Mr. Spencer's agenda for misconstruing Islam in such a way? <br /> <br />Muslims believe in Adam, Noah, Lot, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, ....., Mohammad. Jews, christians, muslims, hindu or whatever we are all childern of Adam. so please stop buying these propaganda books.
B000063DI9|3.0|Maiden is so iconic, what can be said that hasn't been said already.  This is not my favorite Maiden album, and it came out during a period when many harder bands were surrounded by hairspray and a commercial embrace of things semi-metal. <br /> <br />The video for Can I Play With Madness got some play in its day and is an intelligent song with some evil overtones and Bruce's usual good vocal delivery.  Would I trade My Number of the Beast for it?  No.  Would I trade all my Blaz Baily stuff for it? Yes.
0553801503|2.0|The First 3 Novels of this series is awesome!  That being said, and long wait for the 4 enstallement to grace bookstore retail shelves, this Feast of Crows was a huge disappointment.  There was very little story line.  Most of the novel was belabored with geneaologies of newly introduced characters that borders on cruelty to the reader.  Action?  Limited.  Favorite characters from the past books in play?  Limited or none at all. <br />Intrigue and strategy that was the series trademark - confusing that left one with the sence of hopelessness.  Faith alone is the only reason to read this book or perhaps the hope that it would bridge into a 5th book akin to the greatness of the first 3.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Some people think that this movie was too gory and that christ actually didnt get beaten that bad. Well just so you know the Bible says that people couldnt even recognize him as a man which is saying that its possible he was beaten even worse which is a sad thought. In every 'Jesus' movie i have ever seen, it shows Jesus up on a cross with a little cut on his side. The reason i say that is because \\"The Passion\\" shows detail and shows how excrutiating his death really was, and what he went through for us. The only reason i can see someone not liking this movie is that they are too week hearted and cant take the violence.
0895260131|1.0|I recently had the misfortune to leaf through this book, whose very existence should be an embarassement to our western culture. As someone who has had the chance to study Islamic history in some detail, I was sad to see that this book not only is intentionally inflammatory but riddled with statements that are factually incorrect. It is not so much \\"politically incorrect\\" but straight out incorrect and misleading.
B000AXSN5G|2.0|I stock Neil Young records in the \\"Must Have\\" category. When I need the right words or the right crank, I put Neil on. That's not to say he puts both of these elements in the same song. He's got enough material to fertilize a cow pasture. Unfortunately musically, that's where most of this album belongs. Also unfortunately this record is being grouped in the Folk Rock genre along with Harvest, Harvest Moon and Comes a Time. This is realy Silver & Gold PtII. There's no semblance of country rock here that other publications are calling it. It just isn't. Tepid Folk music is more like it. The tempos drag as Neil tells his stories. And that's very unfortunate because the writing is superb. Whether it's due to him viewing his own mortality with his brush with death or the passing of his father last year, it doesn't matter. The word smithing is strong. It's too bad the vehicle the words ride on is only firing on a couple of cylinders

B000BW7QWW|2.0|SERENITY'S PLOT TWISTS WERE INTERESTING. BUT WHEEDEN LOST TOUCH WITH WHAT MADE FIREFLY GREAT WHEN MAKING SERENITY. WHAT MADE FIREFLY EXCEPTIONAL WASN'T THE CHASE SCENES OR THE GUNFIGHTS OR THE FX. IT WAS THE CREW THAT MADE US LOVE FIREFLY. AND SERENITY THE MOVIE IS AFRAID TO GET NEAR THEM. THE CREW WAS ALL BUT ABSENT FROM THE FILM.  THE SHEPHERD AND ANARA WERE MERELY CAMEOS. THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE CREW WERE DEALT WITH QUICKLY OR NOT AT ALL IN ORDER TO HURRY BACK TO THE ACTION. FIREFLY FANS DESERVE MORE THAN THESE CRUMBS.<br /><br />EVEN THE CHARACTERS HAVE LOST CLARITY. WHEN MAL THREATENS TO KILL HIS CREW IF THEY DON'T OBEY HIM HE LOSES MY RESPECT---AND SHOULD HAVE LOST THEIRS. AND WHEN RIVER CALMLY BEATS UP HER BROTHER, IT'S NOT ONLY OUT OF CHARACTER, IT'S REPREHENSIBLE.<br /><br />SERENITY LOOKED RUSHED. THE PRODUCTION VALUES WERE LOWER THAN THE SERIES. THEY DROPPED TO THE LEVEL OF A SPAGETTI WESTERN. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE DIALOGUE OVER THE NOISE---WHAT LITTLE DIALOGUE THERE WAS. WHEN A CREWMEMEBER DIES, WE AREN'T ALLOWED EVEN 60 SECONDS FOR A GOODBYE. NO, NOT WHEN YET MORE CHASE SCENES BECON.<br /><br />SOMEONE MIGHT WANT TO REMIND JOSH WHEEDEN HE ONCE HAD A VISION FOR FIREFLY THAT MADE IT SPECIAL---AND IT WASN'T ABOUT ACTION.

B0000DIXDR|2.0|Basically, a nice, wholesome girl from a good, caring family looses her virginity to a male prostitute, helps a female prostitute get an illegal abortion (which almost kills her) then WONDERS and is ANGRY about why her father is worried about her and doesn't want her going near the aforementioned people. <br /> <br />Well duh..... <br /> <br />The soundtrack is decent; I suppose that's worth another star
0553801503|2.0|Please, let's be honest. This book had 80% less compelling content and sophistication then the previous three books. GRRM's prose is becoming verbose, redundant, and therefore boring. It's as if he wanted to extend the series to seven books for his publishers, not his art. GRRM's three prior books were completely outstanding in every area of literature.  <br /> <br />It is my hope that he does not fall into the 'Robert Jordan' syndrome. Instead of expanding his already excellent characters, he chose to lengthen this book, by creating more mediocre characters, with little or no true relevance to increase or forward the story.  <br /> <br />Remember, from his very own website, his initial intention was to write four or five books.  <br /> <br />I agree with his first assumption.
B000BKDOCA|4.0|Firsty this is a dance album just to make things clear. If you don't like dance music then I suggest you skip this CD. Because this album is club orientated. The 11 tracks are very good I have to admit even though I never liked Britney, but it was a good idea to release this album because it was hard to find some of her remixes. This collection also includes some previous exclusively released material s this is one hottie if you're a hot club goer. <br />It reminds me of Madonna's effort into the clubs with her \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\"album as well? I have to admit this albumis not bad nor is it worse. A worthy collection if you don't possess many of her singles.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wish I could wax rhapsodic enough to do justice to the brilliance of this show.  I saw Serenity first, then bought Firefly, The Series and was immediately transported into a wonderful, rich, hilarious, tense, moving 'verse.  This show is visually stunning, the writing is superb and the characters of depth and style, anything but stereotypical and flat.  I recommend this show to absolutely everyone.
B00006L3IE|5.0|This is early vocal music very much in the style currently heard in groups like the Hilliard Ensemble and Tallis Scholars. It is very spacious-sounding and solemn, which makes sense- most of the music that we have preserved from hundreds of years ago was written for use in the church. Fortunately, the gravity of the works never stops this set from being thoroughly enjoyable, too. Archiv's sound is, as always, very good.
0060920432|5.0|It may be that this is one of those books that becomes ever more relevant as time passes.  Written in 1990 (I doublechecked the copyright date several times as I was reading, because it just didn't seem possible!), the things Csikszentmihalyi has to say about human experience in general, and more specifically how we experience satisfaction and happiness, remain vibrantly pertinent.  His philosophy is solidly backed by research, and his writing is accessible and friendly (i.e., not academic!).<br /><br />Many books claiming to help us understand ourselves better and find ways of improving our lives have limited usefulness because they are written from a single perspective - but people learn and experience in many, many different ways, so what works for the author is likely to work for only a small percentage of readers.  Csikszentmihalyi avoids this problem brilliantly and simply, because he presents the concept of flow from many different perspectives - physical and mental, solitary and in groups, and so on.  Thus, there is something here for everyone - different learning styles, different behavioral preferences, different life experiences.<br /><br />It's a wonderful book that has already affected my life and my coaching work.  I'm sure I will reread it often - and find new treasures every time!
015603008X|5.0|Flowers for Algernon is the story of a man named Charlie who works in a factory.  Charlie was eligible to partake in an experiment which would make him smarter.  He was deemed low-functioning when he was approached about participating in the study and the researchers assured him that undergoing the operation in conjunction with the study would improve his cognitive capacity threefold.  What he did not know was what the long-term repercussions of having this operation would be and whether the results would be permanent or not.  The entire story line parallels the experience of Algernon- the mouse who the experiment is performed on at first.  As the reader, we see Charlie's rise and subsequent deterioration follow that of the mouse. <br /> <br />The story follows Charlie's journal entries from the time he was a man with an IQ of 68 approaching the operation, to when he becomes a practical genius, having tripled his initial IQ.  The story resolves itself as the reader follows the disintegration of Charlie's intellect back to the base from where he started, with the potential to drop even lower. <br /> <br />I think that this book is perfect for middle school-aged children because of the variety of issues that it addresses-both scientific and psychosocial.  After Charlie undergoes the operation and his intellectual capacity nears its peak, Charlie's awareness of his self and the way that others perceive him, and did perceive him when he was low-functioning, becomes apparent to him.  Charlie realizes that his coworkers made fun of him and he grapples with his ability to stay at a place where he had been treated with such little respect before. <br /> <br />Reading the story with middle schoolers, lends itself to discussing issues of tolerance, acceptance, and inclusion.  It creates a forum to talk about disabilities and how to treat people we encounter who have disabilities.  It forces the children to examine the idea of inclusion versus isolation and what that means andhow that can impact children who exhibit no disabilities at all.  The story also calls on readers to be critical about their own situations-how they perceive themselves, and what their level of awareness and consciousness is with respect to their peers and the social dynamics of their communities. <br /> <br />The story is also a great book to read with middle schoolers in the technology era because it lends itself to creating interdisciplinary units.  The book is perfect for bringing in issues of medical ethics.  It's possible to discuss topics with students like cloaning and cryogenic freezing-even robotics and reconstructive surgery.  When do we take science too far and when does it do more harm than good? <br /> <br />Finally, this book is a great means for studying literary devices-like symbolism, metaphor, etc.  Overall, the book is timeless in its application to life because it will only grow increasingly relevant as technology continues to confront us with moral and ethical dilemmas.  The lessons that it teaches young teenagers about acceptance and tolerance are also invaluable.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Every now and then there is a movie that draws you in and holds you spell bound throughout. The Phantom of the Opera does just that. The casting is outstanding (especially Gerard Butler), the music is heart stopping and the staging is pure magic. Congratulations to Joel S. and ALW for taking the movie to a bit of a different place than the stage play. In a word...brilliant.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This is a funny and touching comedy which pits classical hero-worship against modern cynicism to profound effect. <br /> <br />Tim Allen is brilliant as Micheal Nesmith, a washed-up actor stuck (with the help of his many adoring fans) in his glory days of playing TV starship Captain Peter Quincy Taggart. <br /> <br />Nesmith's costars have had quite enough of his ego-tripping, when Nesmith discovers that he and his costars have fans *in another galaxy* -- fans who believe Peter Quincy Taggart and his crew are *real heroes*. <br /> <br />This gimmick alone is brilliant -- but there's no way it could possibly carry the movie without a lot of excellent scripting and acting.  Galaxy Quest delivers the goods.  I can watch it over and over and it always makes me smile and think about what is really important in life.
0143034901|4.0|If you love books, this novel is tailor made for you because it involves an unknown novelist in the midst of a frightening turn of events -- someone is determined to burn and destroy every last book this novelist ever wrote. When a young booklover stumbles across one of the only remaining novels, all hell breaks loose, almost literally. In the process of discovering who is burning the books, the young booklover --Daniel Sempere -- also solves one of Barcelona's most twisted and hidden stories. This novel is filled with great characters and the best of them all is Fermin, the booklover's right hand man. He made me laugh out loud more than once. This book is so close to being great that I believe it probably is great in its native tongue. A delight to read.....
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is a piece of work that is so powerful in all respects that it simply won't go out of your mind, and no matter what happens at the Academy awards, it will stay with you longer than any of the others.  It reminds me of what happened with K Hepburn in African Queen as against Viven Leigh in Streetcar.  Leigh won for a very fine performance, but Hepburn's movie and her performance have been shown many times more than Streetcar - I suppose it's the difference between admiration and helpless involvement.  Heath Ledger creates a tortured man who is already inside most people and can be recognized as part of one's own self.  Hoffman,as Capote, does a stunning impersonation of a man, almost freakish, who is recognized more as someone one has perhaps known, and perhaps is recognized, but not always as someone lurking under the surface of one's own self.  But the movie is certainly not solely dependent on Heath's creation.  Everything in the script fits tightly with everything else - more evidence, if we need it, of Larry McMurty and his collaborator's sublime achievement in glueing themselves to Annie Proulx' original remarkable creation.  I have been attending movies for 75 years (yes, really), and I remember lots of them.  This is among the very greatest I have seen.
B0000640S1|4.0|The film gets four stars, the book gets five!  And what a book. Read it, read the first two or three pages--and you won't be able to put it down. Mr. Morrell is terrific at this type of \\"action\\" tale. <br /> <br />I liked the way this flick was directed, although my feeling is Stallone's monologue at the end might have been handled more convincingly by a better actor...but what can you do? I'm a Nam vet and the words did ring true. <br /> <br />My feeling is Stallone as Rambo is best when he sticks to not saying much at all. That's the character, that's the way I envisioned him from reading the novel. <br /> <br />Also: Stallone's narration (if we're talking about the same edition) is very good. Sly has a knack for this sort of thing. <br /> <br />Lastly, if this were a truly \\"honest\\" flick, the sherrif would have been done away with for what he had put rambo through, and so would have the colonel--for attempting to con him into surrendering... Anyway, that's not the flick we were given...and the flick we were given is not too bad at all. <br /> <br /> <br />You can bet on one thing: it'll be re-made one day...and males you wonder if the people who do it will have the guts to be entirely faithful to the book?
B000069CWE|5.0|Iv'e heard a lot of remixes, some of which were even better than the original, but not by much. But this particular album blew.me.away! This whole album is a remixed version of their successful album hybrid theory. I'll admit, i was a skeptic, but once i heard the first track, i was in love. If you're new to linkin park, i suggest you start with hybrid theory or meteora. You know, just to get your feet wet. But Reanimiation is a definite buy for any lnkin park fan. Heck, they even added 4 extra trax along with the 14 from the debut album, all remixed, and one of the is My December.This album is, and has to be, one of a kind.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|First off, I was never into this guy's music until I heard the incredible TIME OUT OF MIND CD. The Love & Theft CD I thought was nothing special. (Yeah, I know, all the Dylan fanatics are having a fit by now.) <br /> <br />The sections I liked most in this doc are the sections (interspersed throughout) where Dylan, the way he looks today, sits there and simply talks about how he felt about events that took place during the 60s--and touches on some other things: the town he grew up in, hearing J. Cash sing for the first time, etc. This guy Dylan, to me, comes across as a genuinely decent, intelligent human being--and I truly dug that. <br /> <br />Am also  thrilled that he had the smarts to stay clear of all those missguided commie types (who shall go nameless here).  <br />What I have to say  to all those pro-commie goofballs is just this: try living in a communist country before you go around praising communism to us. How's that? Can you grasp that concept, folks? <br /> <br />Lastly: wished they could have gone past the year 1966 here a bit, to see and hear Dylan sing some of his other tunes. <br /> <br />Keep making music, Mr. Dylan. Stay true to yourself. I know: ain't always easy, but you've managed it so far. <br /> <br />Suggestion to all the journalists: can we please stop reffering to this guy as \\"the reclusive singer/songwriter?\\" How can he be reclusive--when he's on every CD he's ever cut, ever book he's ever written--not to mention all the documentaries he's been in? Give us a break, will you?  <br />Want to talk about \\"RECLUSIVE?\\" The great writer B. Traven was RECLUSIVE--and not someone like Bob Dylan. He's even appeared in a Bloody Sam flick, for Pete's sake.

B00005JO1P|4.0|My wife introduced me to Cash's music only 5 years ago and I knew little about his story. This film whetted my appetite to know more since many reviews say it only hints at the real darkness in his life. The Spanish title is Johnny and June: Madness and Passion. I wholeheartedly agree about the passion aspect, Joaquin Phoenix is nigh on perfect as Cash from his stance, speech patterns to his on-stage persona, but we only see flashes of the madness (a few amphetamines too many, a Zeppelinesque outburst in his dressing room and a mano-a-maquina with his Massey Ferguson).<br /><br />The relationship with June is very well developed- and though not knowing much about her- I can only say that it's a perfectly believable love story. The music throughout is well chosen and this morning I woke up with Ring of Fire echoing around my mind (which makes a pleasant change from \\"Can't get you out of my head\\"...).<br /><br />If this doesn't spark yet another Cash revival I don't know what will. Fantastic performances all round, a great soundtrack and a gripping story make for a very memorable film. I hope we see a sequel as the closing credits' \\"They toured for 30 odd years then died\\" doesn't really do justice to the rest of this incredible man's journey. Next time I'm near an English language bookshop I'll be looking for the autobiography to find out more.
B00006JKON|4.0|After the intense albums of the three previous years, including the heavy duty albums \\"Thick as a Brick,\\" \\"Passion Play,\\" and \\"Aqualung,\\" which demanded a huge amount of attention and effort, and constant touring, Jethro Tull was ready for something relatively light.  \\"Warchild\\" is quite playful and sometimes almost frivolous in comparison to Tull's prior works.  The album was also a break before the group plunged back into the depths with \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" and other weighty works.  I imagine \\"Warchild\\" as a Mayday celebration after the labors of the previous works, with the costumes shown on the CD enhancing the playful aspects of this album.  Unfortunately, the playfulness contrasts a lot with their other albums and makes this album less desirable.<br /><br />Getting right into a song that was supposed to form a movie soundtrack, \\"Warchild\\" delivers war-like sound effects and hints little at the story, which is the afterlife of a little girl killed in an accident.  The music is somber underneath, with a lot of strings and musical drama to match the relatively simple lyrics.<br /><br />Back into a topic more familiar to Tull, \\"Queen and Country\\" is a brief political commentary regarding empires and governments.  There is a piano accordion in this song that hints at Britain's naval prowess.<br /><br />The fun begins with \\"Ladies,\\" a pleasant melody with clever percussion that makes this song stylistically fit with Tull's renaissance music.  I think this song is one of the better songs on this CD, with excellent music and simple lyrics.  There is a jazzy ending that makes the introduction to \\"Back-Door Angels\\" seem a bit bizarre.  \\"Back-Door Angels\\" has a heavier sound than the previous songs with interesting keyboards and lyrics.  There are nice guitar licks in the middle and second third that make this song seem out of place with the surrounding tracks.  Listen for the musical tie-in to \\"A Passion Play.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sealion\\" is a fast-paced bit of lyrical surrealism.  There is a circus tone to the music to match the lyrics, but other than the rock instrumentation, this song is all in fun.  \\"Skating away on the Thin Ice of a New Day\\" has both lighter instruments and lyrics.  This song is yet another of the better songs on this CD, although I could have wished for the song to be longer.<br /><br />The song \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\" received a fair amount of radio airplay in the 70s, though the song was a criticism of city life.  This type of song became increasingly rare as the 70s progressed, but the combination of the catchy melody and Tull's popularity combined to make this song a winner.  Critics also get a shot in the brief acoustical commentary, \\"Solitaire.\\"<br /><br />A borrowing from Beethoven enlivens \\"The Third Hoorah,\\" which is part of the \\"Warchild\\" concept.  This song is okay, though one of the weaker tracks on this CD.  Better a soundtrack song than a Tull album song.<br /><br />The closing song to the original album was \\"Two Fingers,\\" a song leftover from \\"Aqualung,\\" reworked for this album.  Keeping with the second half of \\"Aqualung,\\" the song contains more than a bit of commentary regarding salvation and religion.  This song is fast paced, but is otherwise unremarkable.<br /><br />The seven bonus tracks provide a mixed bag of extras.  True to the original concept, \\"Warchild Waltz\\" sounds as though it could easily have been part of a soundtrack.  This music is orchestral, sounding only thematically similar to Jethro Tull.  \\"Quartet\\" begins innocently enough, with a mild jazz sound.  However, about halfway through the song acquires orchestral elements, and then suddenly the keyboards kick in to change the flavor of this song for the second time.  The synthesizer ending is charming and enjoyable.  There is more than a passing resemblance to Wendy Carlos's work in this song, with elements similar to those in \\"A Passion Play.\\"<br /><br />There are portions of \\"Paradise Steakhouse\\" that I enjoy, but overall thissong is one of my least favorites.  I think it has something to do with those annoying \\"dah dah dah's.\\"  Similarly, while there are parts of \\"Sealion 2\\" that I find interesting, this song just seems to add little to this CD.  This song sounds as though it was an excerpt from \\"A Passion Play.\\"<br /><br />I am enthusiastic regarding \\"Rainbow Blues.\\"  This song seems to lean musically in the direction of \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Minstrel in the Gallery.\\"  The song is fast with a good mix of elements, and Jethro Tull's distinctive sound.  This bonus track is one of the better songs on this CD.  I also like \\"Glory Row.\\"  This song is one of the more dramatic and complex songs on this CD.<br /><br />This CD wraps up with the final bonus song, \\"Saturation.\\"  There is nothing like a downbeat song to finish off a playful CD.  This song is about the hazards of city life, and portrays country life as positively as city life is portrayed negatively.  This rock song has heavy guitar tracks and a heavy sound, which makes this song one of the edgier songs on this CD.  Even though the tenor of the song does not fit well with the rest of the CD, I enjoy this song.  Given that most of the songs on this CD were already a hodgepodge of styles, one more dissimilar song fits right in.<br /><br />Jethro Tull, consisting at that time of Ian Anderson, Barriemore Barlow, Martin Barre, John Evan and Jeffrey Hammond, was very popular in the early 70s.  Their music was unique even in an era when unique music was in vogue.  This album was a commercial success, reaching #2 on the charts, and a critical success.  Yet, the music seems less filling than some Jethro Tull music.  If you are in the process of discovering Tull, try \\"Stand Up,\\" \\"Thick as a Brick,\\" or \\"Aqualung.\\"  Save this album when you become a big Tull fan., but overall this song is one of my least favorites.

B0000025ZK|3.0|Your search likely led you here looking for more great music by the guys who brought you Pink Floyd. Don't get your hopes to high like I did those many years ago. David Gilmour is great guitarist and mediocre songwriter - nothing he's put out as a solo artist or as the leader of the post-Waters Pink Floyd lite would make you think otherwise. It's very similar to \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" in many ways, but he's at least trying to make it on his own here. Both this album and \\"AMLOR\\" are very listenable, but they're not the desert island discs some of these reviews make them out to be.
B000AADYYO|5.0|The first time I ever listened to Opeth, something about their style was familiar in an almost jazzy/progressive rock sort of way.  So I popped in my Allen Holdsworth \\"Secrets\\" CD, and sure enough, if you sped it up and distorted it, you'd have Opeth...and I say that as a compliment. <br /> <br />With that said, I must admit that I am not a fan of the belching-style vocals that have replaced singing and screaming in modern metal.  With Ghost Reveries, however, the growling vocals definitely have a place as a contrast to the softer melodic vocals on the CD.  Since that vocal style isn't going anywhere anytime soon, I'll deal with it as long as Opeth keeps creating musical masterpieces. <br /> <br />xan <br /> <br /> <br />

B0006B2A42|1.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid. I bought it out of nostalgia, and regretted it. The movie may have been good for its time, but it is just bad now.  Rock Hudson gives a not-believable performance as a Sub Commander, and the bad guys are sterotypes.

The points expressed by Tolle are extremely true, cutting down to the essence of ones soul if only one sincerely wants to understand. The essence of life is explained most clearly and in a very simple way. Throughout the book, I have admired the authors talant to express such sophisticated philosophical truths in such a simple and easy manner for everyone to understand. Also, the ordering of ideas is brilliant, and the style is impeccable. Its a true masterpiece!

B00005JOFQ|5.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers *** <br /> <br /> <br />I absolutely loved this movie. It touched my heart and soul in a profound way. <br /> <br />It stayed with me for days and I could not stop mulling it over in my head. I have been trying to analyze why I (and others, from what I have been reading in chat boards etc.) have been experiencing such an intense reaction. Here is a partial explanation, from my point of view. I think that most people have experienced at one point in their lives, the intense, aching, longing love for another that cannot be fully realized, for whatever reason, as skillfully portrayed in Brokeback. This feeling touches the core of one's being and that feeling was palpable between the lead characters in Brokeback, even though it was not always explicitly expressed. The brilliant conveyance of such emotion is a tribute to the director and lead actors. My sense is that deeply connecting with the audience is what most serious actors and directors continually strive for in their work. To attain it to this extent is remarkable and laudable and what makes this movie \\"great.\\" A few random observations: While watching the movie, I had hoped that Ennis would open up and express his affection and feelings more readily. Upon reflection, though, I have realized that such emoting would not be true to the character, who was conflicted, fearful and raised in a environment that was not generally hospitable to men expressing themselves in such a manner, especially with another man. The lack of verbal expression, though, did not prevent the feelings from being conveyed, at least to the audience. Also, I was surprised how strongly I felt for Ennis' wife and how difficult it must have been for her to live in the situation, knowing what she did. I also could feel Jack's frustration, due to the fact that he was more ready and less inhibited than Ennis to move forward with their relationship. <br /> <br />I left the theater somewhat morose, but took away an uplifting life lesson as well, which was the central message of the movie, for me. That is, to not let fear inhibit love in your life, in whatever form it may appear.  <br /> <br />
B000002UVX|5.0|There is a common debate amongst Hendrix fans.  Which is better?  Is it The Jimi Hendrix Experience or is it The Band of Gypsies?  I have listened to both extensively and my answer is yes.  They are both mind blowing.  However I must say that I prefer the Gypsies.  Here's why:  The Experience is a looser and more pyschedelic sound.  The gypsies are tighter, funkier and the sound is more grounded.  As I said I love both.  However the difference for me is in the chemistry of the players.  If you listen to the music you will notice a definite difference in the bass players.  Noel Redding's bass is not very distinct on the Experience albums whereas Billy Cox is out in front with Jimi, jamming with him note for note.  As far as the drumming goes, my ears reveal that Mitch Mitchell with his jazz leanings is a more accomplished drummer than then earthy, stompy playing of Buddy Miles.  However, Mitch Mitchell is the only drummer to have played with both bass players. Although I feel that Mitchell is the superior drummer it is clear that he doesn't lock into Billy's bass playing nearly as well.  So the overall chemistry is better with the gypsies.  Plus with Buddy Miles you get the addition of some real soulful lead and back up vocals. <br />   Pick up this album and Live At The Fillmore East and you will hear for yourself.  \\"Who Knows\\" opens the album with an infectious funk groove on which Jimi solos with ease.  \\"Machine Gun\\" follows and is arguably Jimi's greatest musical accomplishment.  \\"Machine Gun\\" is the best anti war song ever written.  Both its lyrics and its musical performance paint a haunting picture of the realities of war.  It is a brilliant and breathtaking performance. <br />Buddy Miles contributes his hit \\"Changes,\\" to the album.  The tune features a classic Jimi riff.  \\"Power of Soul\\" and \\"Message to Love,\\" are great Hendrix penned slow songs that showcase Jimi's virtuosity, the funky rhythm section, and the soulful vocal performances that this group was capable of. <br />Unfortunately the last tune is cut off, you can get the full version complete with the \\"Voodoo Child\\" lead in on Fillmore East. <br />  All in all this is a classic in Jimi's catalog and gives an idea into what might have been.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Reviewing Jefferson Airplane's 'Surrealistic Pillow' is something like reviewing the 'Sgt. Pepper's' of West Coast rock. Most people familiar with that trademark sound, generated by bands such as Moby Grape, The Byrds, The Grateful Dead, Buffalo Springfield, and Crosby, Stills and Nash, would be hard pressed to cite an album that epitomized the era better than 'Surrealistic Pillow'.  Although not many people familiar with this work could be told much that was new about it, the liner notes do inform us of the origin of this albums title.  Not surprisingly, it is taken from an off-hand comment by none other than Jerry Garcia, that something or other was \\"as surrealistic as a pillow\\".  Many psychedelic phrases, song and album titles, such as 'Disreali Gears', were drawn from such happenstance. <br /> <br />I was thirteen years old when this album hit the charts in 1967, and it hit my turntable with great regularity.  It is an uncompromising, eclectic mix of several genre's popular in the acid-rock era.  In those years, as today, I was primarily enthralled by the more heavy, psychedelic rock tracks, of the sort typified by Eric Clapton and Cream.  On this disc, the more firy fare is found with the opener, 'She Has Funny Cars' (words that appear nowhere in the lyrics), the scintillating 'Somebody To Love' (which along with 'White Rabbit' was brought to the Airplane by newcomer Grace Slick, who had recently vacated the Great Society [not Lyndon Johnson's]) which climbed to number    5 on the national hit register, and two of the most underrated rock tracks of all time, '3/5 of a Mile In 10 Seconds' (words that appear nowhere in the lyrics), and 'Plastic Fantastic Lover'.  If it's more reserved fare you're after, check out the prime beef of 'Today', 'Comin' Back To Me', 'How Do You Feel', or the acoustic instrumental 'Embryonic Journey' to hear some of the sweetest melodies ever penned by any rock artists.  If you need a pick-me-up from some of the rather dark subject matter of these tracks (along with the ominous 'White Rabbit', with Grace Slick, ironically, warning all of us to \\"Just Say No\\"), check out the warm and friendly confines of 'My Best Friend', or the mid-tempo respite of 'D.C.B.A. - 25' (letters and numbers that appear nowhere in the lyrics). <br /> <br />While many people despise the cut-rate BMG discs, sold under a promotional banner to cut the artists out of sales revenues, this particular remaster may be the best 'Surrealistic Pillow' in the mix.  It features four bonus tracks, along with the mono versions of 'Somebody To Love' and 'White Rabbit'.  I'm not sure why anyone would listen to the mono versions over the stereo versions, but at least they're here for the taking.  The bonus tracks don't add a lot to the package.  'In the Morning' is a slow-tempo, raw electric blues track which would not have fit in well with the tone of 'Surrealistic Pillow'.  'J.P.P. McStep B. Blues' (words that appear nowhere in the lyrics) and 'Go To Her' are undistinguished, mid-tempo rock tracks.  The fourth bonus track, however, 'Come Back Baby', is a funky rock number built around a tremendous guitar riff.  This one could easily have added more punch to the original vinyl, but they probably ran out of grooves. <br /> <br />This 'Delux' edition comes nicely packaged with well-written liner notes and reprints of all the photographs that accompanied the original vinyl album.  It has to be regarded as one of the top ten albums of the psychedelic era.  Although the sound of the disc is certainly steeped in the texture of the 1960's, I don't see anything wrong with that.  There is no reason to favor the 'sound' of any decade over the sound of another, except of course the 1980's which everyone knows totally sucked.  If you've never heard the '...Pillow', or if you haven't taken it in for some time, do yourself a favor and either create, or refresh, your memory.
B0000025DD|3.0|There was a good system of checks and balances in place within Pink Floyd between the musical stylings of David Gilmour and the biting lyrics of Roger Waters. Left to their own devices they each did OK on their first couple of solo albums; in this case a solid set of tunes featuring some exemplary guitar work. Overall, the songs aren't that memorable and the production sounds dated in a middle-of-the-raod 70s sort of way. An enjoyable record, but not likely to stay in heavy rotation.
B000AP04EW|3.0|The movie was O.K.  I think people hyped it up to much, so when I saw it I was expecting this wonderful movie and got just an O.K. one.
0739313126|1.0|I read lots of different types of books, some written for braniacs and some not. This said, I might even consider myself semi-well-read. So take my opinion for what its worth:<br /><br />This book is so poorly written, I cannot imagine recommending it to anyone over the age of 15. I am 35, college-educated and even used to read Stephen King relatively energetically... but this book, whooooo.... its so bad. The story has lots of potential, even kind of a good story, the kind you could tell at a dinner party... but the way its written puts it on the shelf next to the Fabio-airbrushed covers of cheap romance pulp... if I still had it. Which I don't. Second hand shop around the corner has my copy.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|I've really enjoyed the recent tendency of horror films to bring traditional stories out of old mansions and creepy cemeteries into our everyday existence -- into the apartments and houses of a modern city.  This urban horror is becoming almost a genre of its own, and it has a way of bringing the fear home in a way that other stories don't.  Along with \\"The Ring,\\" \\"Session 9,\\" and \\"Creep,\\" \\"Dark Water\\" is a good entry into this growing field.<br /><br />Centering around a run-down apartment building in the most urban of cities -- New York -- the story builds its suspense gradually and skillfully, using our modern conveniences to disturbing ends. From overflowing sinks and toilets to washing machines and a drywall ceiling which won't seem to stop leaking black water, the hints as to what is happening start slow and build to a disturbing crescendo with the climax of the plot.  The film is visually stylish and plays with our perceptions well, allowing the suspense to ebb and flow but never fade completely.<br /><br />The story itself is also uniquely modern, starting with Dahlia Williams and her daughter Julia, freshly separated from Dahlia's ex-husband, moving into the old apartment building on Roosevelt Island because it's near a great school and they can't afford anything better.  The quickly discover that something is wrong in the building, and it infests the very walls -- or more particularly the pipes in the walls.  The nature of what haunts the building and why becomes the central theme, and by the time we discover it, it takes an inevitable toll.  The ending of the story is surprising and impressively emotional, hitting just the right chord without disappointing.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly excellent and convincing, with special attention for Jennifer Connelly in delvering a great performance which never fails to convey what it needs to.  In many ways, the movie depends on Dahlia being convincing in her role as Julia's mother, while dealing with her own issues as well, and Connelly puts out just the right feeling for each scene.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Dark Water\\" is a creepy, effective, scary movie with an emotional center that may surprise you.  It's not an easy movie -- it has some disturbing themes and will probably leave you thinking about it after the credits have rolled -- but if you like your movies dark and frightening, you could do a lot worse than \\"Dark Water.\\"r own issues as well, and Connelly puts out just the right feeling for each scene. <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Dark Water\\" is a creepy, effective, scary movie with an emotional center that may surprise you.

B000B8QG22|5.0|Many have tried to dismiss this film as nothing more than a comedic vehicle for Robin Williams. The concept of making light of the horrors of war, particularily Vietnam since it's still so recent in the minds of many turns alot of viewers off to the important potential lessons to be learned in this wonderfully insightful movie.<br /><br />Based on the true life accounts of Air Force officer and D.J. Adrian Cronauer we get a birds' eye view into the strict and ridiculous bureaucracy that can at times reign over military policy and in effect hamper the morale and efforts of the American military.<br /><br />Cronauer provided a much needed spontaneity to the air waves of Vietnam radio and brought however briefly to the American soldiers the contemporary music they wanted to hear. There is alot to laugh at in this film, what else could you expect with the likes of Robin Williams in the lead role. However there is much more going on than what first meets the eye. The concepts of acceptance, friendship, trust and love soon become entangled into the comedic elements which lead to the sad and poignant realization that cultural differences can't always be overcome by good intentions. A bittersweet truth so poignantly conveyed by the beautiful Trinh when rebuffing the romantic advances of Cronauer with the statement, \\"Vietnam ladies not friends.\\"<br /><br />This film will definitely make you laugh. It will also make you cry and even more importantly make you think. In the final analysis that's what it's all about. There are many wonderful performances in this movie complimenting Robin Williams amazing tour-de-force. My two favorites are Tung Than Tran as 'Phan' and Chintara Sukapatana as 'Trinh.'<br /><br />Highly Recommended!!
B0000025ZF|5.0|Brilliant album with Clapton on guitar. It just doesn't get any better than this.
0060589280|5.0|Amazing. No other word for it. There's no point in being cynical about this book and Coelho's writing style; the overall message is far greater than all of that. Once again, Coelho has managed to touch my soul in ways that no other novels have... there is a lot to learn from his writings. Before, sex was just about receiving pleasure. Now, people are starting to see it for what it really is: a way of connecting with the divine.   <br />
0679422714|1.0|What an incredibly biased book. I can only hope that readers are smart enough to not completely eat up what is written by Mrs. Chang and her husbamd.
B00028HBKM|2.0|You, the faithful remnant for whom 1962 never happened. . . <br /> <br />You who still move to the staid pulse and rhythm of the liturgical calendar. . . <br /> <br />You conservative Catholics, who are in many respects indistinguishable from mega-church-going evangelical Christians in your penchant for cheap political ostentation: American flags set in car windows, bumper stickers proclaiming the driver's abhorrence of Roe v. Wade or uncritical support of the present administration, and so on. . . <br /> <br />. . . I realize now the reason why Mel Gibson's *The Passion of the Christ,* which I understand is steeped in singularly Catholic theology, full of iconography and lore that the evangelicals' forebears would have derided as \\"Papistickal claptrap,\\" could achieve such pan-Christian appeal. It was because the making of this film was more a political act than a devotional one. It gave both conservative Catholics and evangelicals an excuse to drop the cudgels of a centuries-old antagonism and rally around the pet project of a well-heeled schismatic madman. The film became an emblem of insularity and the absolute rejection of the liberalizing tendency of the last hundred years. It is a *fasces* in the pure etymological sense -- an axe carried before both the conservative Catholic and evangelical Christian with the purpose of smashing the coupling between them and the train of history. <br /> <br />As below, so above, I guess.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|I simply cannot stop listening to this score. Williams shows again what a genius he is. I don't know alot of technical jargon, I only know I heard this soundtrack and sat spellbound, that's all I need to say.  I also found Revenge of the Sith to be a fantastic score as was War of the Worlds (scared me silly). <br /> <br />John is just amazing as usual. <br /> <br />
B00007E8V4|5.0|I have all of System of a Down's CDs, and they're all very much worth buying, but I'd have to say that this one is their best. All the songs are very good. Some of my favorites are Chic 'N' Stu, Nuguns, Highway Song, F**k the System, Ego Brain, and my very favorite song by System of a Down and possibly my favorite of any band, Streamline, since I can really relate to the lyrics and they're very powerful. This is a great CD, definitely worth buying.
1573223085|4.0|I love the way Pink plays with paradigm shifts.  Another paradigm shift that is very relevant here is the change from \\"Jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none,\\"  \\"dilettante\\" \\"dabbler\\" to Renaissance Soul.  Renaissance Souls are often accused of having \\"too many\\" interests, especially if those interests don't fit tidily on one side of the brain or the other.  In the \\"cradle-to-grave\\" economy, Renaissance Souls were often seen as irrelevant.  Now their love of change, passion for learning, and exciting mix of left-and-right brain abilities will be perceived quite differently. As the terrain widens the way Pink predicts, the road should become easier for Renaissance Souls.
B00005AQE8|5.0|The Album is a \\"THA SHIZNIT\\"!!!...One of the best albums I've purchased. 2PAC was surely on top of the world with this album. The first song \\"Ambitionz as a Rider\\" is a good intro to what you are about to witness in this collection. PURE Hardcore Elegance! What more can say!
B00008OLYN|1.0|I am a huge Opeth fan.  I enjoy both there \\"softer\\" songs and there heavier songs.  I was intrigued when I heard that they were going to release a album full of all soft slower songs.  When I purchased this album and threw it in, I was extremely disappointed.  I was expecting to hear songs reminiscent of Credence, A Fair Judgment, the slower parts of songs like Deliverance, When and The Drapery Falls ect.  What I got was this bunch of crap.  This is a worthless release by one of the best bands in the world.  I can only hope that this is not a sign of things to come. <br />I recommend purchasing any and every Opeth album released before this one and leaving this one on the shelf.  It is not even worth the curiosity, it's that bad.
0920668372|1.0|I have 2 young kids who I love dearly, and I LOVE reading to them.  HOWEVER...this is a very warped book.  The mother \\"creeping\\" into her son's room creeps me out! If I could give it negative stars, I would.  We received it as a baby shower gift, and the only other times I've had it out have been to read it to others and laugh at how ridiculous it is.
0061020710|5.0|A great start to a great series. Witty fantasy. Quick read. I cant wait to read the rest.
0385510454|1.0|I really like John Grisham, but he seems to have adopted a Walmart strategy lately. The books like \\"The Chamber\\", \\"The Time to Kill\\" and even recent \\"The Summons\\" had great plots, but also nice writing style and believable characters. Not to mention, one could learn a lot about life in the South. This book must have been written by Mr. G's evil twin. The plot is a great idea poorly executed and covered with a ketchup blob of a silly happy end.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Opeth is one of the best band in the world.  The sheer musical quality in the songs they write is amazing.  The guitar work throughout this album is at times hard and fast then transitions to softer and melodic just as the vocals.  The vocalist has a excellent \\"death\\" voice and \\"clean\\" voice.  Everything comes together beautifully and perfectly.  I can not say enough about this release and this band.
B000002LIX|5.0|One of my Top 10 CDs of all time. Period.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I have been a Strokes fan since the beginning. Bought every album, saw them perform live on their first tour, and basically followed their career.<br /><br />Having heard Juicebox on the radio and knowing that Gordon Raphael no longer produced  the album, I was keen on buying this album to check out what The Strokes were up to this time around.<br /><br />This is a completely different album from Is this It and Room on Fire. Longer, deeper  and with a \\"cleaner\\" production. Musicianship is amazing through and through: awesomely weaved guitar riffs with some great solos, solid and sometimes danceable bass lines, drum machine-like precision and energetic drumming. The songwriting contains deeper lyrics.<br /><br />On a first impression (no pun intended) this album is harder to enjoy on the first listen than  previous releases. It grew on me after a couple of loops to the point where it hasn't left my cd player since the release date.<br /><br />It is a departure from your usual fast simple Strokes songs, but in no way are these new songs boring.  The band has changed their style, I do not know why many reviewers have dismissed this as something bad. I think they were hoping for Is this It version 2.0. On the other hand I much prefer a band unafraid to explore new things, be creative and throw something as unexepected as this album.<br /><br />I agree that the album sounds too polished due to the change in producers (Athough Gordon Raphael contributes in a few tracks). Personally I prefer Gordon Raphael's style which defined The Strokes's sound.<br /><br />This record is better than 99% of any mainstream releases. In a world full of emo pseudo-punks and laughable hip-hop acts, The Strokes are a breath of fresh air. Just like back in 2001 when nu-metal ruled the earth.<br /><br />As a side note, check out the B-side on the Juicebox single, it is an amazing song called Hawaii.<br /><br />Awesome music. Cool art work. Great band. Get it.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />J, <br /> <br />J
B00005OMTT|5.0|I have been a big fan of Enigma since I first heard them back in the early nineties. LSD is a solid collection of great Enigma songs and you will not be disappointed.  Also check out the recent Nine Worlds CD by Achillea (Enigma's guitarist) which is great and the Metamorphosis CD by Digital Moodz.
B000092Q4U|4.0|This is a solid release however there really is nothing special here.  The tracks are straight forward and don't really offer too much in the creativity department.  What you get is what you got, which in this case is not necessarily a bad thing.  Lamb of God is a brutal band who's music creates some insane pits.
B00006AW2S|5.0|This album and the following one, December's Children, are the ones that describes the best what the Stones were in the sixties. <br />And if you listen to the albums of that period, I can't see any Rock album which is so good from beginning to the end. Rubber Soul and Revolver, which are the best Beatles albums of the period are more Pop album then Rock. <br />Satisfaction is still the the rock anthem as the 5th of Beethoven is for the classical music. Maybe not the best song but the one that represents the quintessence of rock: a fabulous mix of Blues, Rock and Pop. <br />Same thing for The last time. You listen to those songs today and it stills sound good.
B00062IVKI|3.0|...but unfortunately it is a bit difficult to warm up this film to due to Robert DeNiro`s unlikeable character.<br /><br />The interplay between Bobby and Liza are THE BEST. Unfortunately it echoes Mama`s A STAR IS BORN 1954 storylinewise. The \\"HAPPY ENDING\\" number is a blueprint of Judy`s \\"BORN IN A TRUNK\\"-number. The titlesong is good, but sadly it is clear that Liza mimes the number(as are the routine), but she doesn`t open her mouth wide enough for the last note.....<br /><br />See it for the musical numbers if you are NOT in the mood of 3 hours of a male \\"hero\\" only a wolfmother would love hehehe
B000AY74OG|4.0|Even adults would like this movie. My 4 year old daughter loved it. This is one that we did not see at the theater when it was out, and it is rare that I will \\"buy\\" a DVD without having first rented or seen it in the theater, but I just knew my money would not be wasted on this one and I was right. Even my 14 year old son watched some of it. It is too cute!!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I am sick and tired of all these narrow minded people who dont know what the hell thy're talking about...This is a great album. well worth the money, and a worthwhile investment. I cant believe people say Sully's trying to sound like Layne. They sound NOTHING alike.... SO because Layne sang about addiction no one else can??? how does that work??? People say they ripped off the name.... Hey, maybe it was meant to be a TRIBUTE!!!! ever think about that??? And lastly, I am a big AIC fan, but why does everyone make Layne out to be a god...what, because he died? just like Cobain..why does everyone idolize a friggin DRUG ADDICT???? I like their music but he did it to himself. Plenty of other people had bad childhoods (Jerry Cantrell of the same band) and are still alive. They didnt take the pussy way out, they dealt with their problems. SO stop judging this band as someone else and judge them on their own merits. 5 star album 5 star band. If someone else doesnt like it....hit the stop button
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This CD has been reviewed as sounding like Fall Out Boy. You do not need to hate/love them for sounding like Fall Out Boy because they don't sound like them. Just like every band out there, Panic! At the Disco has influences and Fall Out Boy is one of them especially since the producer and the record label are the same. If you listen to the sound, there is always a techno background and big beat, just as the band states that they sound like. Another thing is that instruments such the piano are used which makes it even harder to categorize them and compare them to any mainstream band out there. The lead singer sounds like Patrick Stump at times, especially in \\"The only difference between martyrdom and suicide is press coverage\\" and that is why people may get a little confused. For a first album, it sounds musically mature and the lyrics are very clever. This is definitely a great CD to buy and even though I'm a dirt poor college kid, it was worth my money.
0684800713|3.0|I read this novel roughly six years ago, and found recently I couldn't remember anything about it whatsoever.  So, being the borderline compulsive reader I am, I instantly picked it up and read it again.  I think perhaps the reason the story didn't stick out to me much from those years ago is because there isn't much of a story to speak of.  I realize Hemingway is a master of American literature and is revered by legions, but I simply am not impressed with The Sun Also Rises.  Our characters are disillusioned members of the Lost Generation, those people who experienced WWI, and residing as expatriates who enjoy the many lavishes of France and Spain.  I admit, this could be quite an interesting premise, and although the bullfighting sequences are exciting near the end of the novel, the rest of it is not much more than a lot of arguing and drinking.  They discuss, they drink, they eat, they argue, they move to another caf&eacute;, they drink, they eat.  And so on.<br /><br />I've studied Hemingway.  I know the accolades he received for an evolving style and for changing the way many people look at prose.  I understand he stripped away a great deal of fluff in order to get to the core of his subjects.  I know all this.  I'm afraid it does not change my opinion.<br /><br />Jack Barnes, our narrator, and Brett Ashely, the lady friend he loves, simply did not illicit any sort of emotional response from me, nor did their story.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:0595360823 Souls Triumphant]]
B000AGTPUA|5.0|We saw this at the theater over a year ago, when it was new and we were so taken with this movie, that we bought the DVD later on when it was released.  Our 4 year old daughter was glued to this movie in the theater, and then later at home this past Christmas.  We had friends over who had never seen it, and they were thrilled....even my teenage son and his friend loved it!! This is a movie for \\"all\\" ages.We will be watching this every December as a tradition. I can see why this is already a classic.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|THe guitar work is great! Something a lot of new metal bands seem to lack. BUT the guy that sings has one of the most annoying voices and vocal styles I have ever heard!!!!! If they got a different singer they could be a really great band
B0007PAMR4|3.0|This DVD has a very small audience, which is why it surprised me to see it advertised so prominently in weekend sales ads. Dune was a notorious flop. The extended \\"Alan Smithee\\" version is equally infamous. It fails to fix any of the original's problems and simply adds to them with inept changes in a haphazardly assembled cut. To appreciate this DVD you have to love Dune yet be able to tolerate the bad narration, bad dubbing, bad edits, bad music, and overall butchering present in the long version. To enjoy the restored and lost footage requires you to have missed it in the first place, making knowledge of the book and/or miniseries crucial. Under those conditions, the new scenes are great fun. Sadly, the three hour version of Dune is fundamentally flawed in its structure. The majority of the running time is spent on what is essentially an introduction, while the heart of the story is condensed to an unfulfilling climax. The effect is like watching the first part of the miniseries with the remaining four hours edited down to just over 50 minutes. While the original movie left out the myriad details of the history and culture of Herbert's universe, the long cut seems to leave out the story itself. The Reverend Mother scene, Alia's birth, Paul and Chani's love affair, Paul's rise in the Fremen ranks, and everything else important is rushed through as quickly as possible. The result is a movie which builds up a fantastic hero's journey, then completely fails to pay it off. The meaning of it all is lost in an apparent attempt to craft a story about a superbeing who defeats a group of loathesome villains out of a story about spirituality, economics and culture. A great transfer and generous but rudimentary extras are perhaps wasted in this handsomely packaged offering, as their worth can be found only by the diligent and the forgiving.
B00080ZG10|2.0|Martin Scorcese is one of Hollywood's biggest 60's era hate-mongers of American culture. Scorcese was a product of the \\"do-your-own-thing\\" 60's and all of the social dysfunction was created by that philosophy.  And the Aviator is another in the long list of movies in which Scorcese \\"does his own thing\\"...which is twisting the truth to match tenor of his own bias and hatred of America's religious and cultural heritage.<br /><br />Scorcese tries to tell us that Howard Hughes had Obsessive Compulisive disorder, the victim of his Freudan over-possessive mother. What rot! Howard Hughes had syphillis.<br /><br />If you review the events in the movie with this in mind, everything will suddenly make sense.<br /><br />I give the film a ZERO star for historical accuracy, and 5 stars for special effects! But what American movie today doesn't rely on special effects? That IS the defination of a modern Hollywood movie...a lousy plot and lots of expensive special effects.<br /><br />Enjoy the movie for it's entertainment value of the special effects. But don't think for a minute this was a historical movie about Howard Hughes..it was about what Scorcese in his twisted mind thinks Howard Hughes was.<br /><br />Hollywood, like GM, like America--is decaying rapidly. The fact that an idiot like Scorcese is viewed as one of Hollywood's finest director producers pretty much proves that.
0393317552|2.0|As a student of history and not anthropology I have to say that this book had well discussed thoughts as to the why, where and how civilizations occurred, grew, and ultimately flourished around the world.  This book ultimately takes fundamental ideas which are simple to understand and by the time you are finished you are overwhelmed by the simplicity of both the arguments and the arguer. <br /> <br />My issue is not with the text but with the delivery.  One of the most difficult tasks is to try to make statistics, facts, and concepts such as discussed in this text interesting. <br /> <br />This book neither compels the reader to continue to research this subject, nor come up with their own ideas.  It is what it is, a text which provides facts but little by the way of enjoyment.
B000AU9UYC|4.0|Christian Bale IS BATMAN I think he was the best to have played the super hero of the past. I think after the orginal Batman the others were poorly written and somewhat of a bore.  I mean Val Kilmer and George Clooney there talants are best used in other films such aa Val Kilmer's performance in THE DOORS which he was incrediable in. Lets face it girls would you just love to see George Clooney in those scrubs playing the ever so sexy and slighty turlmoulus Doug Ross on ER. Bale gives something to the charcter that the other actors have not been able to do creditability and mystery.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Gnr Rocks! They always had talent just like Green Day and Dire Straits. The Beatles were lame! Avoid the most overplayed bands of all time, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Cars, & Aerosmith and get this masterpiece.
B00005Y228|5.0|its obvious that he has no knowledge of Miss Minogue, and he obviously is a Madge fan who is scared that Minogue is hot on her heels and is already more successful than her in Europe and Australia - ha! And how ironic you talk about this album as \\"crap\\" and full of electronic beats, yet Madonna's new one is also full of this \\"crap\\" and you're probably loving it. Madge is the old fool that needs to retire soon, she's aging fast and her music is getting duller. Its time for Minogue to take the crown. <br />I recommend this album to everyone into pop and dance music, all the songs are 10/10!
B00004Y6NP|4.0|The Man's Too Strong is actully one of the worst songs I have ever heard, and annoying. Other than that, I think it is pretty <br />good though I don't get it why everyone likes this record so much. The best songs are So Far Away, Money For Nothing (that track really rocks you), & Walk Of Life. Those are the 3 of the opening songs on the album and they are brilliant and rock. I like Making Movies better, or Green Day even better Warning. <br />But this is still really great. 4 stars because it contains only 1 bad song.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Oh boy, it feels like Christmas again. To have this classic movie in both incarnations....in the same box....oh yeah. Jingle all the way.<br /><br />As a die hard fan of the Lynch version of the Herbert novel, I already own a copy of the extended version. Not sure of the source of the disc but the quality isn't too hot (thanks eBay).<br /><br />Now I get to have an official release with the option of watching either version (George Lucas take note....this is how you keep fans happy).<br /><br />The Lynch movie was the closest to Herbert's vision in my opinion and can not be out done (unless Tim Burton wanted to give it a shot). The recent mini series was embarrassing and painful to watch.<br /><br />This is a must own for all Dune fans. The extended version of the movie is not as strong as the final edit, but it's great to see some of the deleted scenes. Plus it never hurts to have another copy of this great movie on the shelf.
B000000OQF|4.0|This is an alright album, but Greatest Hits was more of their better one. This was their first album, contains like 2 good obscure songs, Rocket Queen, & Mr. Brownstone. And then it contains the 3 most popular songs, JUNGLE, PARADISE CITY, & SWEET <br />CHILD OF MINE. But Rocket Queen gets really a sad song after 5 minutes. Greatest Hits was the best.
B000008HZE|5.0|This MFSL release does NOT have any bonus tracks, nor does it feature expanded liner notes. It does have great sound, from the original master, and is on 24K gold disc, which is a better medium than alumin(i)um. It reproduces the original liner well.
0671015206|1.0|This book outright lists the \\"productive\\" ethnic groups in America, all of which are European only (i.e., Russia, Scotland, etc). It also lists millionaires as fitting a certain profile, such as being of European heritage, married with a stay-at-home wife. After reading these pages, I couldn't continue. <br /> <br />I returned the book and got a refund because it offended me. I'm an unmarried female whose ancestors are not from Europe. It had no practical or useful advice that could apply to a broad audience.  <br /> <br />The authors need a crash course in diversity. Millionaires span all backgrounds. If you don't believe me, just ask Oprah (who's a billionaire)! <br />
0140042520|5.0|On the Road, Kerouac's other acknowledged masterpiece, was east coast, new york feel and about squeezing every ounce of sense, touch, smell and experience out of life. This is his west coast, buddhist, pre-hippie mirror of that more famous book. Suffused with eastern thought, nature and trends that were to overtake america a decade later, this book is every bit the equal of On the Road.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is by far Madonna's best album to date. My favorite of all of hers before this one was Erotica and now that is number 2. I can't stop listening to this CD. I've got both versions (the original and limited edition) and all of the hung up remixes. I can't wait for all of the sorry mixes to be released. I think Hung up is great and all and it brought her back to the forefront but the best is yet to come. I am so loving that she picked sorry as the next single and I can only hope that the 3rd single (and 4th) is (are) jump and get together. I love them! Then hopefully I love New York will be released.Yeah the lyrics are simple but hey it's a pop song, What do you want? Then I hope either superpop and (or) how high are released. Hey I'd love to see Let it will be as a single and Forbidden love but I don't think those will end up as radio singles (probably remixed club versions though). Everything on this album is excellent! I can't wait for the \\"Confessions\\" tour. And by then the album will still be going strong. (I'd say probably until she is ready to make her next album which everyone knows is about every 2 years). Yeah Madonna Rules!!! Always did and always will. (P.S.

B000BKVQTS|1.0|I didn't see this in the theatre nor own the DVD, but watched it via Pay Per View.  My family simply hated it, which is beyond shocking as we tend to lean towards Fantasy/Sci-Fi/Action.  Actually, we didn't even have as strong emotion as 'hate' for it, just overwhelming boredom and the question, \\"Why are we wasting our time watching this?\\"  In fact, during the first viewing I started dozing off.  My husband doesn't even want to bother finishing it, but I gave it another go and I think the only recommendation I'd have for owning this is for use as a sleeping aid considering that I fell asleep again.<br /><br />The premise itself is old - Con Men sweeping into a village to pull a huge scam.  Think about the Pied Piper or any of those old snake oil shows with plants in the audience that come up for a swig and announce all their problems have been healed.<br /><br />The fact that the Grimm Brothers have an ironic \\"Don't cry wolf\\" adventure in store, while interesting, just didn't work conceptually.  It's not that the effects are bad, though I've seen better.  The acting might not be bad, either, but it certainly wasn't enough to make the two 'protagonists' (and I use that term loosely) likeable.  Nor does whatever evolution their characters should be having really stand-out.  There simply aren't any characters that are worth giving a damn about.  To sum it up (or down), when I questioned whether I should delete the movie from our Tivo, there were responses of, \\"Please, yes!\\" from all over the house.<br /><br />I suggest reading the original Brothers Grimm fairy tales - not the sterilized/Disney-fied ones - but the original dark stories with all the blood and not always happy endings fairy tales.  Emminently more interesting and exciting, not to mention NOT having to deal with the onerous weight of the authors' own incursions.
B0001AP12G|5.0|haven't listen to the album in a while, but i can distinctley remember the first time i heard the first song on the album.i had just bought it from a mall and popped in my brother's car, and i was simply blown away. kanye is da man ever since you uttered his name out of your mouth. from the tracks covering topics from a religious stand point on christ to just making a dope beat with a couple of the sickest lyricists in the business to staying in school. it's clearly evident that kanye can speak his mind anyway he wants too. kanye's flow is crazy. his creative genius is clearly evident and it invokes a sense of curiousity and mischief mixed with political justice and freedom. memorable tracks include: through the wire, spaceship, never let me down, slow jamz, two words and family business. if you haven't picked this up PICK IT UP, same thing with Late Registration. simply what hip-hop needs to be.
B000001GS3|5.0|I became familiar with Shirley Verret through this recording. The team of principals are excellent and Maestro Abbado is fantastic with the orchestra. This recording shows the unique and amazing artistry of Ms Verrett in one of her signature roles. She remains unsurpassed in this account. Brava!
0553801503|3.0|I think you have to look at this book in the context of the overall story. Clearly, Westeros is falling into complete disorder, first because of the insanity trait in the Targaryen family, and second because of the Game of Thrones situation described in the first three books.   <br /> <br />One way or another, the main thrust of the overall plot is that Daenerys will return to Westeros and restore order by kicking butt.  She will also mark the return of strong Targaryen rulership.  It seems to me that much of her story so far has focused on all of her \\"Across the Narrow Sea\\" experiences as grooming for strong leadership.    <br /> <br />The Wall/Jon Snow/Starks/Religion will all somehow contribute to her arrival to the Iron Throne, but its tough to predict how.  But the Feast of Crows book seems to reveal that Daenerys isn't operating in a vaccuum, and she will have to enter the Game of Thrones as well.  Until this book, my impression was that the players in Westeros aren't really aware of her (except for the assassination attempt).  Clearly they, and the new bit-players, have been aware of her for a long time, and that's going to be important in the future. I think the book suffered because of the publisher issues, but I look forward to the rest of series, and am not worried that this is Wheel of Time indulgence.
0689815816|5.0|My son cannot get enough of this book!  We have read it at least 5 times a day for the past 6 months.  A game popped up as a result too . . . I hide one of his teddy bears and we go on a bear hunt to find him.
0307276902|5.0|Simply awesome. Frey's writing style totally captured his emotions and all the details of life in the rehab clinic - simplistic yet very powerful. Even the way the book was displayed - with the cover, scribbles to separate parts, and the small dialogue at the beginning, were all very suiting to the story. However, the novel could have been consierably shorter without all the curses :-). Even though it was brutal at some points, it was a page turner the whole way through. I disagreed with Frey's mindset in that I think he should have accepted more of the help that the facility could offer and that taking part in the 12 Steps would have been beneficial, but nonetheless I was extremely impressed that he made it through and has never relapsed. Despite the controversy over this novel, I still think that it's a wonderful novel with plenty of good messages that one can take away from it. Regardless of it's catergory, whether it be a memoir or fiction, this novel is completely worthy of all the praise and publicity it has been given.
0393317552|4.0|I asked the author to his face if he considered it plausible that domesticated plants and animals could have been products of (lab based) genetic engineering. He looked at me like I was crazy and gave me an emphatic \\"no.\\" Yet this hypothesis is every bit as reasonable as his exclusively Darwinian hypothesis. And, since there are many myths which refer to domesticates and various other gems of civilization as being gifts from the \\"gods,\\" I think \\"history\\" would support my hypothesis much more strongly than his. Apart from being narrowly Darwinian, Diamond's book is quite long winded and the last 30-40% redundant. Nevertheless, it is worth a read and fairly well argued.
0440241588|3.0|I just finished this one today, and I'd say it definately kept me turning the pages, but it wasn't too great compared to Grisham's other stuff. The Testament, The Chamber, and most of his other ones surpassed this one by far. The first few chapters were extremely dull, and I was glad to get through them and read on to see where Joel/Marco would end up. The parts I probably liked most about this one were the great descriptions of Bologna and the cafes and such. Also, the I loved the Italian, being the language nut that I am, and after reading this book I think I'd consider learning it sometime. Although Grisham probably didn't intend to write a guidebook for Bologna, he did - one could probably enjoy a great vacation just from reading it - all the best cafes, the sights to see, and basic Italian. The plot wasn't as thrilling, rather mediochre, and the characters were a bit too unbelievable. Don't expect Grisham's usual great stuff; this one is just average.
B00005JOFO|5.0|See it.  You'll find something in every viewing that you missed the last time. <br /> <br />Ang Lee's eye for panoramic beauty is untouched by any other director.  This film continues to take award after award with no end in sight which sadly means it will be a while yet before this film comes to DVD.
0887307280|4.0|The e-myth deals with the concept of working \\"in\\" your business and working \\"on\\" your business.  Most entrepreneurs do not realize the difference and end up spending their time trying to do it all only to wind up exhausted and wondering why they got into their business in the first place.  I think this book does a good job of explaining what business owners need to understand in order to ensure the success of their business.

B00005JKN9|3.0|This is an interesting tale of 1860's (and earlier) New York where life was often as the historians put it \\"nasty, brutish, and short\\". I am curious how historically accurate the movie is, but if it is accurate it explains a lot about how New Yorkers are today (at least how they are perceived by those who are not New Yorkers). The opening battle scene is quite memorable as is Daniel Day-Lewis's character -- The Butcher. Leonardo DiCaprio & Cameron Diaz are less noteable, however.
0060920084|4.0|This book is typical Bill Bryson, ie one very funny book.  One of the downsides of reading Bryson in public is people look at your strangely when you break out laughing.  Bryson, an Iowan by birth but currently living in England, drives around the USA through 38 states commenting on life in mostly small towns.  He has a lot of good things ,and not so good things to say about us.  Not a very deep read, but definitely an enjoyable one.  And informative, too.  For instance I didn't know that the Mennonites in Lancaster, PA  are named after a well known brand of speed-stick deodorant
0553573403|2.0|the prose is fair, most of the characters are quite well rounded, the environment is very well formed and consistent, and the central plotline is good, but IMO GRRM has serious structural issues as a writer.  These issues almost caused me to put the book down several times.  My attitude while reading this book shifted between fascination and utter frustration at the poor judgement of its author.<br /><br />First off, the pacing is ok, once it gets started.  there was NO CENTRAL CONFLICT until page ~120, when you realize \\"oh, it's a political drama\\".  You are given 120 pages to get acquainted with the characters and the environment, and until that point, i literally had no idea what the book was about!  There's pretty much no excuse for this.  You must inform the reader what the central plot is very early, usually within the first 5-20 pages.  If you were generous you could say that the plot weaves together lots of threads and is complex, if you're being critical you would say that the writer created a plot more complex than he could handle.  In either case, we the readers suffer for it.<br /><br />Secondly, Martin uses the common and exceedingly annoying crutch of giving us narration from the points of view of different characters.  Being an SF/Fantasy reader, one gets accustomed to this kind of thing, and I have read and enjoyed many books which fall victim to this affliction. But Martin exhibits by far the worst case of this malady i have ever seen.  by page 90, there have been 10 chapters from the POV or 7 different characters!<br /><br />that does help explain why he takes so long to get started: he's telling too many different stories at once, and so the book feels very disorganized and discordant.  when he has you going with one thread, you finish the chapter and want to read on, but then, \\"Ugh!\\", you see that the next chapter is going to tell you about a completely unrelated storyline.<br /><br />And let me tell you exactly how unrelated the storylines are.  OK, so there is some small amount of interplay between the storylines, but what little interplay there was was terribly insufficient to justify the inclusion of sideplots that NEVER relate back to the central conflict.  These sideplots serve one purpose and one purpose alone: to set up the conflicts for the next book.  The second book should be able to handle itself.  This is just shoddy writing, plain and simple!<br /><br />I kid you not when i say that there is an entire thread line that takes place on another continent with characters who never interact with the central plot IN ANY WAY.  This kind of thing drags the entire book down and slurs the pace horribly.  By the end of the book it is clear that that story will be important for the next book, but this just makes it more annoying.  you have to read another 800 page behemoth in order to get the payoff you've already earned.<br /><br />In my opinion, if Martin could think of no better way to write a series than to have a first book that contained completely extraneous elements, he should not have written the series.  If your book idea can only be executed by creating a disorganized story, then yours is a BAD IDEA.<br /><br />Even so, the book was hardly a total loss.  I did care about the characters, the enemies were not entirely flimsy cardboard, and the central plot was interesting.  It's just too bad that all that extra garbage got thrown in.  this 800 page novel could easily have been 400 or even 300 pages long if Martin could have found a faster way to introduce us to his admittedly rich environment and then removed all the fat which serves no purpose other than to slow down the central plot.<br /><br />If you like rich fantastic environments and conniving political drama, read 'Dune', which informs the reader of the central plot within the first few chapters (not to mention the incredibly well crafted intrigue, which utterly spanks Martin's comparatively feeble squabbles).  If you want a story that readslike 3 similar books put through a cuisinart, read 'A Game of Thrones'.want a story that reads like 3 similar books put through a cuisinart, read 'A Game of Thrones'.
B00012FXB8|4.0|Alien is a good series. Alien was an excellent horror film. Aliens was a superior action film. Alien3 is a good suspense/horror film. It is not the best of the series and is only looked at poorly because of Aliens. Aliens set the bar. A lot of people wanted Alien3 to raise the bar even more. They wanted another shoot em up film. Granted I like those types too, but sometimes you need to take a break and tell another story in another way. <br /> <br />I think that the overall plot is well thought of and keeps things interesting. The story is well told and moves at an O.K. pace. An alien escapes from an egg inside the Sulaco. It causes a fire which causes our heroes from Aliens to crash land on an almost abandoned facility that is now a prison. Yes, it is sad to see Newt and Hicks both die after all that they've been through. Although this just makes the story all the more depressing and troublesome. <br /> <br />People also don't like Alien3 because there is only 1 alien. Well 1st off there are 2! One that's running around loose and another that's growing inside Ripley's stomach! Duh! They act like that one doesn't count, when that's the whole reason why Ripley jumps into lava (and the reason for the 4th movie).Geez people learn how to count. Anyway what makes it interesting is that now we learn that the aliens can be altered slighty depending on their host. So now we get a dog alien. This was a good idea. An alien that's stealthy, cunning, and more aggressive. Who could argue with that? An especially nice effect is when we see what it looks like through the alien's eyes. The way the camera goes on the ceiling and the walls was a pretty cool idea. <br /> <br />The whole setting of Alien3 is something different than the 1st 2 films. Alien is a huge cargo ship that shows you how lonely space can be. Aliens is the space station in the beginning and the facility on the planet. These both show us what and how the ordinary person in the future lives. Alien3 is just how longthis has been happening. How long the facility has been abandoned. How long it's been since the new became the old. The fact that they're at a prison makes sense that there aren't any weapons. That puts a twist on the story. <br /> <br />The actors are not the greatest. Though they had to pick people with bad manners and a little bit of stupidity. Sigourney Weaver, of course!, does a wonderful job and shows how far she is willing to go to save the twisted company from themselves. <br />Of course she does this for humanity as well. Her character is as strong as ever. <br /> <br />The main reason why Alien3 is not as good is because the CGI ABSOLUTELY SUCKS. Then again it's not even CGI, it's more like stop motion! The movie is suspenseful, but then when you see a fake looking alien skitter through the halls it makes you want to laugh! And its not really even 1 part. It's basically all the shots of the alien! It's as bad, fake, and cheesey as the 1st Terminator movie (which I like!) You know, you'd think that with how well Aliens did, they could of afforded some better CGI. <br /> <br />The Alien3 collector's edition is a good DVD. The Special Edition doesn't difer much from the theatrical release, unlike in Aliens. All the DVD features are fine and fun to watch. <br /> <br />The only reason people didn't like Alien3 is because of how well Aliens did. They wanted another helping of the same thing, but instead they got a good horror film that they didn't even consider looking at in detail. My advice is this. Watch it with an open mind. Don't think about what you want, just think about how it goes along with the whole quadrilogy. If you expect another Aliens, then don't even watch it. If you expect another Alien film that moves the story along and keeps you entertained for 2 hours then go ahead and see it. <br /> <br />The movie does not deserve a standing ovation, but it does deserve some credit. This credit can only be found if you look at Fincher's work and realizethat it is and overlooked, misunderstood, and overstated excellent piece of work. <br /> <br /> <br />By the way, Aliens eat Predators for breakfast! Aliens Rule!
B000060OFT|5.0|Whats so wonderful about this film is that it gave new life to a story thats done over and over redundantly I might add.  ALmost every love story now has some draw to Romeo & Juliet...abandoned love as it may be, but this film, taking the story by the horns, gives the veiwer a look at where it all began, and what a beautiful look at that.  The dialog, while some may find stupid don't understand that this is not supposed to be a remake but a reinterpritation, same dialog, same sequence of events but just different background, and what a backdrop that is.  THe scenery, the direction is almost is not as moving and gripping as the film itself, and the acting, I mean we all know that despite there typecasting as the pretty people Claire Danes and Lenardo DiCaprio are amazingly talented, thus DiCaprio's multiple oscar nominations, but in this film, with Shakespears words floating off their tongues, they prove they were talented even at such a young age.  Especially Claire Danes who makes you want to weep for her, feeling her pain as she's denied the only man she's every loved and forced onto the hand of a man she loathes.  The story of Romeo and Juliet will play a large part in american pop culture forever I'm sure, and this film will stand its own as the most infectious and most entertaining, not to mention the most inspired and invisionary adaptation of this tragic love story.
0062515675|5.0|This book may well change your outlook towards your social life, day-to-day work, inner and outer self. Very refreshing read that makes oneself ponder why he/she wastes time worrying and not setting high and achievable goals. A book that instills self-confidence and a positive feel. This is not a tale with  high dose of random advice. It wisely interleaves advice finely into a fable and day-to-day incidences that you can relate to , and well remember. I recommend it to everyone, who need change in their life and also to people who think their life is cruising along happily.
B00005O5CM|2.0|And Legally Blonde is more dumb than anything. I just watched this film to see the big praise for it, assuming it might be funny. I found myself hating it more than anything. Reese acts like such a ditz in this film that at times it really annoyed me and the storyline itself was silly with only a few okay parts that could in no way save this film. And I heard there is a sequel to this film? Oh no.  <br /> <br />I know this is supposed to be a feel good movie but come on everyone has to admit it is more stupid than anything. And I can't believe Reese wants to be remembered like that. Thankfully she has done other movie roles that are much better. <br /> <br />Anyway, for people who have not seen it, don't expect much intellectual stimulation. It's pretty simple and foolish and Reese acts like the stereotypical blonde in the beginning who becomes smart in the end- case closed basically.
B00065MDS6|5.0|After the predictable Poseidon, KC comes up with an almost entirely new lineup plus various important Jazz musicians.  The product is bold, unique, inspiring and powerful.  This one of my top 3 KC albums (Larks and Starless being the other 2).  I heard this album 30 years ago and I am still listening to new hues, dissonances thanks to technological advances of recording. It is casual and playful at times but never boring, never \\"over your head\\". This is Andy McCullough's (drummer) only KC project but it is refreshing to hear the freedom, close to melodic chops he displays.  The use of mellotron at is best: with power and depth.  Highly recommended for serious listeners!!
B00000634J|4.0|I'm not a huge Lennon (solo)fan, but he did turn out 6-7 indespensible songs in his post-Beatle career.  This collection has them all, plus a lot more.
B00007KWI9|5.0|This has got to be the most underrated Yes album. It hasn't gained much recognition over the years like Relayer, which was underrated when it came out but sold a lot more over the years. I've read reviews saying that there's nothing memorable or outstanding about this album; I personally disagree with that remark. It may just be me, but I fail to see how the beginning of Beyond And Before wouldn't immediately grab the listener's attention. This is their best album in terms of trying out different types of music; Every Little Thing and Survival are some of my all-time favorite Yes songs. I'm not saying every Yes fan has to love this album, they can think what they want to, but if you are a Yes fan and are thinking to buy it, I urge you to buy it, it's no Relayer, but it's still Yes. Some people seem to not realize that we could be looking at one of the greatest bands in the world.
0307276902|5.0|I read this book well before the so called fall-out.  I was hooked on this book from the first sentence.  I am a Senior and Family Advocate in a large troubled city.  I see wonderful Grandparents raising kids with the precise addictions as Mr. Frey - his writing made you feel and smell the horrid behaviors and results of his addiction - his writing and his style are my main focus - this was a readable horror story of his life - we are dwelling on his mistruths too much not on his 'story' the love and hate of this book in his prose is astounding!!  Read it!!  You will never for get it or him!!
B000001EMW|5.0|1. Enter Sandman-Wonderfully done. That being said, I still consider this to be one of the weaker tracks on the album. It follows the original closely and precisely and I can really hear their admiration for Metallica in this song, but it's missing something. If I find out what it's missing, I'll let you know. :P 9/10  <br />2. Master Of Puppets-I don't really know what to say about this one. I absolutely adore the job the did on the intro and the chorus. Those are some pretty rockin', sockin' cellos. 10/10  <br />3. Harvester Of Sorrow-Hmm...love the song, but it's definitely one of the weaker tracks. The solo is great though. (I usually fast-forward to the middle to hear it.) <br />4. The Unforgiven-The best song on the album, BY FAR! Nice job on the chorus, but spectacular job on the verse. What really made the song for me would have to be the bowing rhythms they used on the verse. \\"The Unforgiven\\" has been, is, and always will be my favorite Metallica song. The cover by Apocalyptica really serves it justice. I sometimes have to refrain myself from singing, \\"New blood joins this earth, and quickly he's subdued...\\" 12/10  <br />5. Sad But True-Fourth best song. It really does the original justice. 10/10 <br />6. Creeping Death-This is a pretty good song. I'm not sure how to describe it, so I guess I won't. 9/10 <br />7. Wherever I May Roam-Third best song. I love how they start soft with pizzacato (sorry, my spelling is atrocious) and just start rocking out. I'm sensing a bumper sticker coming on that says, \\"My brother can beat up your brother. Mine plays the cello!\\" Haha, it needs a little work, but you get the idea. <br />8. Welcome Home (Sanitarium)-The second best song. I still find it hard to believe this is still the same song everyone hears and shouts \\"SANITARIUM!\\" along with. I think I just may like this version better. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful album, and whether you're a metalhead or you tried talking your parents into changing your name to Beethoven, give it a shot. And parents, show this to your kids. These are all instrumentals so you don't have to worry about any offensive lyrics and maybe they'll even start to enjoy classical instruments. Heck, I sure did! (This coming from a teenager.)       <br /> <br />
B0002VKZL6|5.0|A true companero and more than worth los dinero, even if you have to rob a bank to get it! Mark Knopfler is at the top of his gig here. There's no shortage of great guitar work, and like his other solo releases, the story telling is top notch!     Rock, blues, country, salsa, and more styles of music intertwine here than in any other album I've heard. You can't help but learn while being entertained by Knopfler's stories about ill-fated big-shot crooked gamblers, Ray Crock (the man behind the McDonald's fast food chain), go-go club owners, bank robbers, lovers, boxers, and presidents.     Shangri-la is a collection of great stories put to crisp, well produced, and certainly well played music. Fun, dramatic, touching and spirited songs from one of the music world's greatest original talents.     I read a review that said that Mark Knopfler's solo material is a far cry from Dire Straits. That's because Dire Straits is Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler is Mark Knopfler.  Life is about change, experience, adventure and fun. Every CD by Knopfler is a step forward, and I enjoy making the trip with him.

B0007PAMR4|5.0|What is there to complain about on this release?? You don't like the extended version?? Oh well, you have the original all remastered here for you as well. I have a nice LCD TV and a nice surround system and it is great to get both versions all remastered. As far as the \\"6 Hour\\" version goes, it will never happen!! Lots of my favorite shows and movies will never be out the way I want them. \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" has a 5  hour version out that we will never see on DVD. Beavis and Butthead has episodes we will never see on DVD again. Frankly, that is ok with me. <br /> <br />Being a retailer of CD's and DVD's I can understand why the things we REALLY want will never get released. Imagine an industry full of lawsuits, disputes about rights, companies getting bought out, pissy directors crying because the studios wouldn't give them 100% creative control, family members of deceased Cast and Crew members bitching about not making enough money, ETC.  <br /> <br />Consider us lucky that we now live in an age where we can get complete seasons of TV shows and get out favorite movies looking and sounding the way they were when they were originally in the theaters. Most of the time they even look and sound better at home!! Technology has come so far in the last 7 years with the invention of DVD's!! Remember when VHS was around and we couldn't get hardly anything we wanted?? When our only options to watch our favorite movies were to rent them, buy them from the video rental stores pre-owned or for a hefty price of $100+, or just to simply copy them off of TV!! <br /> <br />With the invention of DVD we have been fully spoiled with out movies and we totally expect the movie companies to give us the shirt off of their back. Movies are made for profit!! Even the so called \\"indie\\" and \\"artistic\\" movies are still for profit. It is the actors, directors and movie maker's job. This is how they make their living. Be happy we can all go out and spent $20 or under for a movie we all love and enjoy, being remastered with excellent digital sound and picture that we can add to our collections.  <br /> <br />Because essentially you are getting 2 different movies for the price of one. Try spending $20 for both versions when VHS was around!! <br />

B00005JOFO|5.0|This movie is so brilliantly done.  Not only for the story but also for the music and scenery.  The WHOLE movie is beautiful.  After watching this movie you won't be able to get it off of your mind for quite some time and you too will feel the pain and separation felt by the characters.  I have to say that I have never in my life had a movie make me react in this way.  After it is all said and done, you will feel totally renewed on life and appreciate everyone (especially your partner) so much more.

B00006FM77|5.0|People who know Chicago from their soft-rock hits like \\"You're <br />The Inspiration\\" or \\"Old Days\\" will be surprised to discover <br />that in the beginning they were an \\"underground\\" band, just as <br />likely to be played on \\"free form\\" FM stations as AM Hit Radio <br />back in the Early 70s.  This amazing document of their week-long <br />engagement at Carnegie Hall in 1971 shows the group at peak of <br />their creativity in that first, prolific, musically great period. <br />Yes, there are some very long jams, and a lot more blazing guitar <br />solos than the \\"If You Leave Me Now\\" fans would expect, but it <br />is done with such creativity, passion and sense of FUN that it <br />gives one pause.  I for one prefer their earlier phase, when  <br />they actually had things to say and were not chained to record <br />company hit-making policy.  Suffice it to say that on this  <br />collection the group plays with a vengeance. Robert Lamm's vocals  <br />and keyboard playing are sublime; Peter Cetera sounds <br />more committed and ROCKING than he ever would again; the horns <br />are just fantastic; Terry Kath is on FIRE!! Yes, there are <br />a few ragged spots and the sound is not as good as in a studio, <br />but the overall impression one gets is of an era where music <br />really meant something!  I had the multi-LP set back when it <br />was originally released.  I loved it then, and I love it now! <br />Well worth your time and money if you want to hear a great group <br />before they became Peter Cetera's backup band (and then, even <br />worse).  \\"Chicago At Carnegie Hall\\" gets an A+ from this listener!
B00000DO39|5.0|This CD features Rossini's overtures performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra under Herbert von Karajan.  (p)1961 and 1959 EMI Records Ltd., catalog# 763113-2 - my copy was made in W. Germany.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|When this album came out a friend of mine told me that I had to get it.  He said that if I gave it a chance, I would like it better than Blast Tyrant.  I told him that I highly doubted it because I think that Blast Tyrant is one of the best albums (work of art?) ever released, by any band.  Well, I got Robot Hive : Exodus, and listened to it all the way through and it was excellent.  I thought that it was an amazing album, but it was no Blast Tyrant.  Well, I continued listening (because I told my friend that I would give it a chance), and when I had heard it about a dozen times all the way through, I did like it a lot more than I initially had.  But. . . still not Blast Tyrant competition.  When I told my friend, he said \\"WHAT???  You still haven't listened enough.  Keep listening!\\"  I thought he was crazy, but I really trust his musical opinion and his overall \\"ear\\", so I listened to it about another dozen times. . . Well, I'll be darned if he wasn't right!!  I couldn't believe it.  This album grew on me like you wouldn't believe!  This album is not just an album, it is a composition where everything blends and works together perfectly.  It is not just your average growling metal, it has meaning and keeps your interest.  I see this album as and investment in entertainment that I will not get tired of for years.  Most albums you can get tired of if you listen to them day-in and day-out. . . I see this one lasting EASILY 10-12 years, if I listened to it every other day or so.  There is simply nothing like this album (or Blast Tyrant, for that matter) out there.  I read a review of our local Clutch concert, and the journalist said it best - \\"I don't know if you all are ready for the unholy stench of the manticore!\\"  Amazing album. . . not a purchase . . . an investment in entertainment for years to come.  Get it and love it.  Spend your last $15 on it and starve. . . it will be worth it!
B000002UB3|5.0|I'll say this is not only one of the Beatles greatest, but maybe ever.  Just knowing this was one of the last albums they ever did showed that they still had it.  This was an example of why the Beatles are the greatest band that has ever lived.  Even to see what all 4 members did after they brokeup showed that this will go down as one of the greatest albums ever.
B00006422Z|5.0|Like all of Haneke's films, the less you know going in the better, so I'm not going to discuss the plot. You probably already know that it's about a sexually, uh...different...piano teacher portrayed by Isabelle Huppert with astonishing and heart-breaking power, and really, that's all you need at this point. Don't read the plot synopsis above, as it gives away absolutely everything--really, I think Amazon needs to take it down immediately. <br /> <br />Although this film might not be for everyone (particularly the squeamish or the faint of heart), it's an astonishingly powerful work of art. A lot of \\"art\\" movies are boring, perhaps because they are inaccessible; I can't think of anyone who could sit through this one bored. You can think about this movie on the surface or you can keep plumbing its thematic depths, to very worthwhile results. Aside from the obvious themes in the film, such as madness and sexual repression, the break between high art and popular culture, and sexual/romantic politics, I consider this an important feminist and even neomarxist film (insofar as the film is a criticism of capitalist society)--don't believe me? Google Adorno's essay \\"The Culture Industry\\" and see how closely his ideas are paralleled in the film. But this isn't just me being pretentious, Haneke has Erika drop Adorno's name in casual conversation in the second scene of the film; and of course, Elfriede Jelinek, Noble Prize in Literature winner in 2004 (a scandalous win that shook up the stuffy old academy) is a feminist writer, so we know to look for these themes. Other themes include: voyeurism (especially yours, the viewer...Haneke is definitely trying to punish you for your prurient search for titillation disguised as high art--we're all guilty of it!), parent-child relationships and stage parents, and on an intriguing level, the nature of love, and how it's perverted by capitalist society. <br /> <br /> <br />Sound like too much for one film? It's not! This one will profoundly shock you, leave you thinking about it for days. I've been thinking about it for months now, and only slowly did many of the ideas in the film become clear. <br /> <br />That's the great thing about Haneke; he can weave a lot of different concepts into a film which still works as a film--I can't say you'll have fun, but you will definitely NOT be bored. <br />
B000A32KJQ|5.0|Very listenable jazz. Beautifull piano of Marcin Wasilewski!! Great combination of Stanko on trumpet and Garbarek on tenor saxophone, blending very good. Easy drumming by Manu Katche, never getting in the way of the music. The rhythm-duo (Slawomir Kurkiewicz on bass) does what it must do: create the base of the songs, but with a great sense of timing and subtlety. The sound of the album depents very much on the sound of Wasilewski's piano. The second song sounds a little like EST, but it doesn't get the same intensity of some EST-material. But that's no problem here.   Full and warm recording, with enough aspects for both the romantic and the cool intelectual.     (Further more I recomend the good review of Jazzcat.)
B00005RRG9|5.0|This version is much better than the new one because there is a lot more character development.  Very good family film.
B00009RAJH|5.0|Back when I started college in the late 1980's, I bought Fleetwood Mac's Rumours album after I saw that it had a whole bunch of songs on it that I knew from when I was a kid. But it didn't have a couple of the other Fleetwood Mac songs on it that I wanted, so I also bought this album too.<br /><br />I cannot say that I was disappointed.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I had only heard about half as many songs from this album on the radio (as opposed to Rumours), I find that Fleetwood Mac is just as good as a listen as its more popular discography sibling, if not more so.<br /><br />The reason seems to be that there is an infectious amount of positive energy in this album which seems to stem from the new members and the new direction in which the band was taking their music.  Clearly, this is eveident in Christine's McVie's pop-charters \\"Over My Head\\" and \\"Say You Love Me\\".  However, there are times when \\"Monday Morning\\" or \\"Sugar Daddy\\" will pop into my head despite the fact that I haven't listened to this album in years (much to my dismay).<br /><br />The only thing that I don't like about the remastered release of this album is that someone (either the band or the record company, I think I know which) decided to add in an additional 5 tracks to the CD.  This is something that I'm not a fan of and, while I understand why they're doing it, I'd really prefer that they didn't do.  Oh well, I guess that's what iPods are for these days.
B000BVQ9JO|3.0|The Strokes get things started alright with You Only Live Once, a strong enough track to have been a b-side off of their first album, but it's downhill from there. Vocalist Casablancas can sound like a post-Stooges Iggy, and truth be told he was more compelling than anything the grand Stooge has done in recent decades, but on First impressions of Earth the derivative streak continues without surpassing or even equaling it's various sources. Hear The Smiths cheerfully moody gloom without Morrisey's golden throat or vicious, clever pen. \\"Kiling Lies\\" sounds like a U2 cover band trying out their first originals. The songs have grown in length and have lost their infectious hooks, perhaps in an attempt at maturity. Unfortunately First Impressions is at its best when it's covering old terrain on tracks like Razorblade and the afore mentioned opening track. The rest of the tracks aren't awful but quickly become background music, not measuring up along side The Strokes previous recordings.
B000021XR5|5.0|All the talk of revolver and the adulation....how is it albums like this go unnoticed? This is such a musicians showmanship masterpiece, without the glam or hype, there are tracks on here that are simply amazing and unexpected and you can see an evolution in the song writing that is unparalled today. if there was 6 or 7 stars I would give it. Again, the initial radio track or MTV video chosen to showcase this release was weak, undermining the entirity of the CD, and I wonder if that is why it didn't do too well. There are always comments about how weak this or that was and I don't see that...Down beats you to death and the rest of the album takes you through cascading highs and lows without boring you. Buy this CD, old and new STP fans will always find something here and the latter Shangri La Dee Da
B0001WTWCO|5.0|Excellent and well developed story. Right up there with 'A Sound of Music and 'My Fair Lady'!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I did not see the TV series before I watched this movie so did not have any pre-conceptions (other than I like Josh Whedon's stuff and was a big Buffy fan).<br /><br />The movie is extremely good and well worth watching.  The movie and it's plot have all been described in great detail by other reviews and I won't repeat them here.  My only problem with the movie was difficulty understanding the dialogue sometimes.  The characters have their own patois that was hard to follow at first (nothing like speaking in Klingon, but enough where it threw me off occassionally).  I had to turn on the captioning to make sure I understood what was being said until I got the hang of it.  It didn't bother me:  I thought it was original and gave another futuristic flavor to the movie.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good movie that will stay with you longer than the butter on your fingers from your microwave popcorn, check out Serenity.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls has got to be one of the single best TV shows ever to appear on our TV screens. From the wonderful people at WB they have brought us a combination of wonderfully witty and sometimes outright hilarious humor coupled together with wonderful drama and thought provoking plot lines. While not along the lines of the West Wing, one cannot deny that Gilmore Girls is a cut above the rest.
B000001GPX|5.0|When Carlos Kleiber released his classic Beethoven Fifth in 1975 with the Vienna Phil., it made his reputation overnight, and the recording was greeted as a revelation. At the time I wondered if this was really true, since two older Fifths from the early Sixties, Karajan with the Berlin Phil. and Bernstein with the NY Phil., seemed quite wonderful already. Now I have the latest remastering of each, so I decided to sit down and compare them.<br /><br />Sonics: The Kleiber recording was never one of DG's best--edgy, a bit thin, lacking in warmth. In its \\"Originals\\" reissue things are improved but not drastically so. However, neither Karajan nor Bernstein sounds appreciably better, the main difference being that these conductors asked for heavier weight in the lower part of te orchestra and were given wider stereo by the engineers. There is still some shrillness in the strings at loud volume on all three CDs. I would say that Karajan's latest SACD remastering gives him the edge. The trumpets at the beginning of the finale, for example, sound more exciting and easier on the ear.<br /><br />Tempos: It's remarkable that all three ocnductors hear the Beethoven Fifth at the same tempo in every movement, within a few seconds of each other. (Karajan times out faster in the finale because he skips the exposition repeat, which Kleiber and Bernstien both take). The main exception is Bernstein's first mvoement, which at 8:30 takes a full minute longer than the other two and sounds stodgy by comparison (heard in isolation it comes off as measured and grand, a traditional approach in this movement, except for the ever-fleet Toscanini).<br /><br />Interpretation: Here is where Kleiber's reputation stands or falls. I think if I played these three recordings blind, the finales would be identical to any listener. Karajan's first movement is more propulsive than Kleiber's--a surprise since Kleiber was praised for finding new energy in this worn-out music. In the second movement, where Kleiber always seemed light and expressive, the other two are, also. The scherzos are more or less identical. Only Bernstein's measured first movement gives away his performance, yet with careful listening it emerges that Karajan's phrasing is a bit on the stiff side, while Kleiber's orchestra seems a shade more alert and expressive.<br /><br />In all, these are all performances to live with a long time.  To me, it was surprising that Kleiber wasn't as revolutionary as I'd thought three decades ago. If it makes a difference, I once put five versions of the first movement on a CD to see which was preferred by some friends in a blind listening test. The Kleiber easily won, so maybe there is something special here after all. Second place went to Reiner's great recording from the Fifties on RCA.ht and expressive, the other two are, also.

0553571338|5.0|I thought that Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver\\" was an awesome book. Some may find it disturbing, but even if it is disturbing, the way it was written was a style that I enjoyed. Lois Lowry also has other books related to the Giver, but although I haven't read them, I will always think The Giver was my favorite. I had to read it in my gifted reading group, but am glad that I had to. The Giver is banned in some libraries, but I found it complex in some ways, but simple and logical in others. Hopefully you, reader, will enjoy this book as much as I did! <br />         Other books in the series with the Giver: <br />         Messenger <br />         Gathering Blue <br /> <br /> <br />        Please enjoy this book if you buy it or already own it!!!
B000001FOL|4.0|Nico's detached, icy demeanor and deep, searching voice are very attractive attributes and make \\"Chelsea Girl\\" a consistent pleasure; relaxing, ambient and seductive from start to finish. This music sneaks upon you; after a few spins, you find yourself humming along and just drifting into a baroque haze while the beauty of the arrangements and THAT VOICE wash over you.<br /><br />A new favorite, \\"Chelsea Girl\\" is perfect candlelight music.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|this is a cd that i can listen to over and over.  I like the lyrics and the songs have a lot of good beat.
B000002G7E|2.0|Supposedly abrasive and avant-garde, this train wreck of an LP has very little in the way of actual musical value. I gave it 2 stars for the spoken word oddity \\"The Gift\\" because I'm a poetry lover and John Cale's reading manages to sustain a modicum of interest over 8 minutes, otherwise, this is a case of a lot of stinky smoke, but no fire.
0345409671|4.0|I am a devoted fan of Anne Rice, but I saw this book with a very skeptical eye. The story goes like this: Lestat is the toothy, arrogant creature who struts his sexy stuff around the globe, and fears nobody. Right? Not so, when the DEVIL himself stalks him incessantly, drives him into a slight psychosis, and offers a deal Lestat cannot refuse. The Devil, who likes to be called \\"Memnoch\\", takes Lestat on a journey through Heaven, Hell, and some bizzare place between, all the while arguing against God and God's cruel philosophy regarding human salvation. When Lestat, having sacrificed one of his eyes to escape, is returned to earth, he brings with him the veil of Veronica the Saint, to prove he didn't hallucinate the entire affair. In the end it proves little to him, but his cohorts Armand and David are forced to reconsider their prior notions of atheism, evil, Christianity, and the role of God in the bigger scheme of things.  <br /> <br />It is a curious book, if nothing else because it is thought-provoking, and as a spiritual yet not overtly religious agnostic I found it both comforting and offensive. FANS BEWARE, however, that this book does not well capture the essense of the other Vampire Chronicals. Lestat does not seem like himself, having gone from Mr. Fearless Stallion to \\"crying like a little kid\\" at the sight of dark shadowsm. The Religious theme can be overwhelming and somewhat tiresome. (and need I say boring) After all, Religious contemplation is not exactly the main allure of the Vampire Chronicals.  The book came across as Anne Rice's own struggle with the fundamental questions of Christian religion, and the vampire characters are playing only a minor role illustrating her point.
B00006IU73|5.0|I am 53 years old, a guitar player & multi-track recordist. I know late sixties and seventies rock music inside-out, upside down. It was a major part of my life... and has remained so as a serious hobby. Amidst just enjoying the fun rock stuff, I always preferred the more artistic / interesting  efforts; which unsurprisingly was more prominent in prog rock. That's no news to anybody reading anything here, so nuff about that. <br /> <br />I have largely been disappointed in the direction that rock took since ~ 1980 because it chose to pretty much abandon or ignore any progressive flavour in it's promoted new path. And...  I also find it a CRIME that the \\"so called\\" Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame DOES NOT HAVE ONE Prog Rock inductee. [ i.e Don't tell me that (for instance) a storied band like Yes, long in career, doesn't belong there ahead of....   you pick one.]   <br /> <br />Anyway, like most of you, I am particular in my taste for what I like. Music is a personal thing. I like pickles on my hamburger, you don't. But we both like a great hamburger. <br />Anyone taking the time to write a review on this album has something in common with everybody else (who took the time here). And I must say, this album DESERVES the time !!  <br /> <br />I am really enthused to hear what I just heard here for the first time!  HOW FRIGGIN' REFRESHING !!  My faith is suddenly restored ! I just finished listening to 'In Absentia', and I'm now listening to 'Deadwing'.   And I can't wait to tell my \\"fellow 53-year-old dinosaur friends\\" about this. <br /> <br />Prog rock fans: Rock is no longer adequately represented in garbage events like the Grammys, and most of radio pretty much does what the vacuum cleaner does. We don't need any of that as long as music like this is being created and magnificently produced.  Buy it, and run with it.  You're gonna like it. VERY CREATIVE, dynamic musicianship with amazing sound quality ! <br /> <br />One little note: People always draw some comparisons, which is normal. Just a minor thing that hit me...  <br />...the voice in a couple spots during the mellower parts of the 1st half reminded me of Lol Creme's voice during his tenure with 10CC (who were a very creative band though not considered progressive). <br /> <br />Cheers!
0316172324|4.0|Gladwell has the rare ability to articulate complicated concepts into easily understand catch phrases. No wonder The Tipping Point was so good. That book took a theory and provided many substantial examples to underscore his point.<br /><br />His latest release is no different! Slightly different in format, in that it culls material from previously published items, Gladwell takes us on a tour of the power of instant impressions.<br /><br />More than just another take on 'making a good first impression,' Gladwell examines how much we take in and process instantly. Probably more now than ever in this fast-paced world we live in.<br /><br />A terrific read for the single man out there, trying to round out some of the rough edges he may be unaware of, to those of us seeking some deeper levels of understanding.<br /><br />- GiddyupGuy
B00000DQSZ|5.0|Finally picked this up on CD after losing the vinyl copy many years ago.  It's hard to believe that this originally came out almost 30 years ago.  It still tops a lot of the electronica that's out there, and you can't compare the imagery and irony contained in the lyrics to anything produced these days.  Now if the copy of *Man Machine* I ordered would just get here, I could fully regress back to my high school days . . .
B00005KB9W|5.0|If that is the case, then let it be this one. Myself, I enjoy Bob Marley for what I see as therapeutic purposes. Chill control. That guy is the most chill guy that there ever was, mon. Don't be knocking. Only an A-hole would bring disrespect down. Personally, my collection has TWO Bob Marley Cd's. This one here and the earlier release CATCH A FIRE. I know I'm missing lots of hits and what not, but, man... dig this record. The hits mean nothing after this one. THIS IS THE GREATEST... its live, yeah, don't think twice about it. These are by far the most passionate versions of every one of the songs on here. This is the absolute best material he ever put out. NO WOMAN NO CRY... awesome, puts tears in my eyes...BURNIN AND LOOTIN... killer, studio version has nothing on this one... BELLY FULL.. way better than the studio... you get the picture so far? The album may not be as long as say LEGEND... but as a whole, this is quality, not quantity..  this album is just right.
0060736267|5.0|I am having a hard time believing someone would give this book a bad review.  I must have read it 10 times over my life and I love it!  I am about to purchase a new copy for my almost 9 year old daughter, as my copy is obviously well worn.
B0002X314C|4.0|the last time i got this excited about a new artist was hearing norah jones for the first time while sitting in barnes and nobles...maybe even more excited this time around.  <br /> <br />this guy is SO talented. what a fresh new sound, r&b w/jazz w/classic w/gospel- & his voice is amazing...understatedly talented in such a casual manner. i love it! <br /> <br />the only thing sad is that it took until his grammy nomination to find out about him. i hope he'll take home the grammy's this year!
B00005O5CM|4.0|It's too rare to see a comedy that is fun without resorting to gross humor.  There is some slapstick but for the most part the comedy relies on how the 'dumb blonde' is perceived by others and how she changes her goals and image.  That sounds serious but the film is pure fluff.  I only knocked off one star because the dialog isn't very witty.  The premise might work as a tv sitcom with the right star and good writing.  Otherwise for a one time look this is a pleasure to watch.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Once again, I am astonished by what the media classifies as brilliant works of art.  That an album as simplistic, basic, and effortless as Mariah Carey's The Emancipation Of Mimi can garner such acclaim, and that Carey herself gets labeled as one of the all-time greats, is equal parts astounding and disappointing.  Anyone who can mistake this album for being a masterpiece either has not heard much in the way of music, or has been convinced to believe this by the incessant radio and video airplay that these songs receive.  I for one am not going to be goaded into buying such lunkheaded nonsense, and I'm here to suggest that others should also refrain from believing the hype. <br /> <br />There's no doubt that Mariah Carey has a solid set of pipes - that much I'll give her.  It can span several octaves, which is more than can be said about some of the tone-deaf singers out there (Ashlee Simpson, anyone?).  But what kills this is her delivery - these songs are plagued with either too little vocal restraint, or sometimes too much (\\"It's Like That\\") as well as her insistance on using a rap-like cadence all too frequently which makes these songs too predictable.  Could it be that Carey, who once unrepentantly belted out a repertoire of easy-listening love ballads, now wants to show everybody that she has street cred ... that she keeps it \\"crunk\\" while she shows off her \\"bling bling\\" so that no one gets up in her \\"grill\\"?  Throughout her career, Carey has basically represented unrealized potential in my eyes - she could have done something relevant and substantial, but instead gravitates toward shameless commercial accessibility at any cost.  There's no doubt that Carey's switch from adult contemporary princess to hip-hop ice queen had to do with a changing of the commercial tides.  So I suppose that if the popularity of hip-hop/R&B wanes and techno/polka becomes the in thing, maybe she'll jump onto that bandwagon, too. <br /> <br />From the early part of her career up totoday, it seems that Carey never learned how to harness the true strength of her voice, often resorting to sloppy caterwauling instead.  It seems like the main \\"talents\\" she uses are dressing like a streetwalker and emitting hyena-like noises, both of which the masses eat up for whatever reason. <br /> <br />As far as the album goes: If you're looking for music that is both shallow and infantile, then The Emancipation Of Mimi will be like manna sent from heaven to you.  You'll find lots of sickeningly sweet balladry with a \\"let's stay together\\" message, like \\"We Belong Together\\" and its sound-alike/sequel \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", the latter of which includes an ill-advised rap from Carey (who obviously didn't learn anything from Madonna) that actually makes Fred Durst sound like Tupac Shakur.  Then there's cheesy lite-R&B like \\"It's Like That\\" and \\"Shake It Off\\", with the latter including lines delivered in what's best described as cheesy schoolyard taunting (i.e. the \\"you're gonna miss me...\\" blabbering).  Speaking in both terms of lyrics and arrangements, Mimi is way too simple to be deserving of all the praise, and Carey doesn't bring enough to these songs to make them worth hearing - altogether it's just a pointless waste of time, a piece of shoe leather when you're craving filet mignon. <br /> <br />In summary: If The Emancipation Of Mimi is deserving of an award, I think \\"Most Overrated Album Of 2005\\" would perhaps be most appropriate.  It just goes to show you that commercial jingles and wearing outfits that let everything (including all that cellulite) hang out are about all that Mariah Carey has to offer, but it doesn't matter - that apparently is what the people can't get enough of.  What makes matters even worse is how greedy Carey and her record label are - The Emancipation Of Mimi has already received four (that's right, FOUR) separate releases, with a heavily rumored three-disc fifth edition possibly on the way.  Talk about taking advantage of your fans - Carey sets an absolutely deplorable business model for herself and shows that all she cares about is money.  Ask yourself - is this someone you want to support?  This fact notwithstanding, Carey doesn't hold a candle to the great R&B singers back in the day.  No way is this album worth your time, money, or all the ink that's been spilled on it.  If that $15 is burning a hole in your pocket, there are better ways to spend it - like, I don't know, any way you could possibly think of!
B00015HVI8|4.0|This is the first season without Daniel Jackson as a central character. He does some cameo and guest star work but he is no longer a part of the team. We are not even sure if he is really alive. <br /> <br />This is also the weakest season so far. It is still good entertainment and presents some fun ideas but they seem a little more strained this time around. I don't think this is because of the Jonas Quinn character who replaced Daniel. I've enjoyed watching him trying to establish himself in the team. Its just getting a bit old. I still give it 4 stars but just barely. <br /> <br />Episode synopses appear below. <br /> <br />Redemption Part 1 - The season opens with the SG1 team still in disarray over the loss of Daniel Jackson. They have tried out 8 replacements and none have worked out. The one person who really wants to be on the team is Jonas, the alien who defected to earth at the end of last season with a supply of Naquadria, the new element even more powerful than Naquida. Teal'c receives word that his wife is dying and heads through the gate to attend her passing. He finds his son bitter over the loss of his mother and wanting to prove himself in his father's eyes. The supply of naquadria brought back by Jonas has proved to be a boon and allowed the development of an experimental fighter with hyperspace capability, something even the ghouls don't have. Meanwhile, a wormhole is opened in Earth's gate and nothing comes though. The SGC is unable to shut it down and being open constantly threatens to blow up the earth if the power is not drained off. O'Neill and Carter are sent off in the new fighter to try and get help from the Asgard but it doesn't the hyperspace capability does not work. Teal'c learns that it is Anubis who is attacking the Earth's gate and tries to figure a way to help. Gen. Hammond is having his own problems with the Russian liaison and a primadonna scientist. There are many different small stories here that will have to wait until the next episode to be resolved. <br /> <br />Redemption Part 2 - The Stargate is still set to explode and take the earth with it. Teal'c and his son decide to do a little father and son bonding by taking a ship to the planet where Anubis has his weapon and trying to destroy that weapon. Meanwhile, the crew on earth is trying to figure out how to save the planet. Between Maj. Clark, Jonas and the primmadonna, they come up with a harebrained scheme to use the new fighter to take the thing into space so that it will not be on earth when it goes off. The convolutions making this difficult are too much to get into; watch the episode. Needless to say, things do not work as planned but the Earth gets saved at a price. It looks like Jonas gets to join SG1 and the Russians will have more access to the SGC <br /> <br />Descent - At the close of last season, Anubis had captured Thor and tried to download his mind and knowledge into his mothership. The SG1 crew managed to rescue Thor but not before the damage had been done. Thor is now in a coma and it is doubtful if he can ever be revived. Now, Anubis' mother ship has shown up in the solar system. The good news is that it seems to be deserted but that begs the question of why a perfectly good ghoul mother ship would suddenly find its way to Earth without any ghouls aboard to attack and keep things interesting. The SG1 team heads on over to investigate. They find a derelict with the self destruct activated but on hold for an unknown reason. They also encounter some middle aged, mutant ninja jaffa. It seems that when Thor's mind was downloaded, he managed to sabotage the mother ship and halt the countdown, giving it instructions to head to earth. The ninjas manage to sabotage the sabotage and the ship crashes into the Pacific. Now, it is a race against time to see if the SG1 crew can be rescued before the hull breaches and the ship explodes. <br /> <br />Frozen - In this curious episode, the SG1 team heads back to Antarctica to the site where the alternate Stargate was found. They have found something new. They find a woman but the amazing thing is that dating shows that she is older than humanity: several million years. It is the archeological find that will set everything we know on its head. As the body is removed from the ice, everyone is amazed to find that she is still alive. She is very frightened when she comes to and is in bad shape but she heals remarkably fast. Remarkably, she is one of the few people ever encountered by the SGC who doesn't speak English. She is a fast study, though. She only ever manages to say one word at the very end but she does begin to understand very quickly. On the down side, everyone around her comes down sick. They get worse and worse. The girl show an ability to heal them but each time she does so, she gets weaker herself. There are more people to cure than she can handle. She dies before she gets to Col. O'Neill and it looks like he is done for. The only hope is a Tok'ra symbiote and he can't stand the Tok'ra. <br /> <br />Nightwalkers - I have been referring to the Goa'ould as ghouls because I was too lazy to type the apostrophes. In this episode, we get to see at least some of them as night stalking ghouls with an ambiance right out of the 50s and 60s horror movies. Last season, a billionaire kidnapped Maj. Carter in order to learn more about the ghouls in the hopes that he could be cured of his disease. It did not go well for him. In this episode, we learn that after his death, his company carried on with a line of research cloning ghouls. The experiment has gotten out of control and a small town has been taken over by the ghouls. Two things working in the SGC's favor are that the ghouls are immature and can control their hosts only at night, when they are sleeping and that they are not as bright as they think they are. <br /> <br />Abyss - A recent episode ended with Col. O'Neill on the verge of death and being taken off by the Tok'ra in the hope thata symbiote will heal him. He was completely missing from the previous episode but, in this one, we learn that he and the Tok'ra possessing him have stolen off for unknown reasons. The Tok'ra have been reticent about letting SGC know what is going on but have finally come clean, partially and against their will. It looks like the colonel has been captured by Ba'al, a previously unknown ghoul system lord. As he was captured, the Tok'ra infesting him left his body. Now, Ba'al wants to know what they were doing on his planet. And he is resorting to torture to find out. A normal torture session can be ended with death. O'Neill's problem is that whenever he dies, he is brought back with a sarcophagus and it all starts over again, worse than before. To keep him company, Daniel Jackson puts in an appearance. In order to help him out of this untenable situation, he wants to help O'Neill \\"ascend\\". The problem is that O'Neill doesn't want to ascend. He just wants to die before he can divulge any information. It is an ugly situation.  <br /> <br />Shadow Play - The SGC gets a communication from Jonas' home planet. The political situation on that planet is getting worse. Jonas' country fears invasion by an alliance of its two enemies. They are threatening to make preemptive use of the naquadria bomb. They want to negotiate with Earth for military technology so they will not need to use the bomb. Earth is skeptical. They don't really trust these people. They are, after all, the same ones who tried to frame Daniel Jackson. In a Machiavellian web, everyone has ulterior motives. Things are made more confusing by Jonas' former mentor who claims to want to begin a coup with the aid of a resistance movement. His judgment, though, is not quite right. Nobody trusts anybody else. It seems to be politics as usual. They seem to be trying to draw some parallels with Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project. <br /> <br />The Other Guys - This is a comedy episode. The SG1 team is offworld with agroup of scientists. They are all dweebs in the nerdiest sense of the word but one of them has a severe case of hero worship for Col. O'Neill. When the SG1 team is captured by some Jaffa working for Anubis, the geeks take it upon themselves to mount a rescue mission. In the finest tradition of the Keystone Kops, they manage to wreak mayhem at every step of the way until they find SG1, only to learn that SG1 is on an undercover operation. The geeks come through, though, when the original plans fall to pieces. This one is lots of fun. <br /> <br />Allegiance - A Tok'ra outpost is overrun. Because there is not other choice, the SG1 team evacuates the Tok'ra to Earth's alpha site, a planet which nobody has the coordinates for. The site is staffed primarily with free Jaffa. Therein lies a big problem. The Jaffa do not like the Tok'ra. The Tok'ra hate the Jaffa. Col. O'Neill dislikes the Tok'ra but the Jaffa are getting on his nerves too. When a Tok'ra is killed, the rest are sure that a Jaffa did the deed. When the suspected Jaffa is killed, the Jaffa are sure that the Tok'ra have extracted revenge. The situation is getting more and more tense. There is a hidden enemy afoot with a strategy of divide and conquer. <br /> <br />Cure - The SG1 team visits a new planet which is eager for trade and relations. They seem very open and even offer a miracle drug which cures all human ailments in trade. What they want are gate addresses. The problem is that the gate addresses they insist upon are all ghoul home worlds. Even when warned of the danger, they insist that those are the addresses they wish. Teal'c and Jonas stumble onto the source of the wonder drug. They are using ghouls. They even have a ghoul queen. Things are not as they seem, however. The queen is not a ghoul. She is a Tok'ra. Her freedom will condemn to death countless of the natives who are addicted to the drug processed from the bodies of her offspring. It is much less macabre than it sounds. <br /> <br />Prometheus - Maj. Carter is surprised when a reporter confronts her and asks about the Prometheus project, a secret project involving building a new, hyperspace capable ship. She has some of the facts. She has enough to frighten the politicians into letting her take a camera crew on board. They agree to swap exclusive footage in exchange for keeping the story under wraps until the Pentagon is ready to release the information. Nobody is happy with this arrangement but they get less happy when the camera crew turns out to be a bunch of NID rogues bent on rescuing Col. Symmonds and the ghoul who took over the millionaire last season. The hijacking takes place and the SG1 team finds themselves stranded in an unknown location on an experimental ship and now way to get home. It's a cliffhanger. <br /> <br />Unnatural Selection - The previous episode ended with the SG1 team stranded in an unknown position aboard and experimental human ship with no way to find their way home. The Asgard are there to save the day, however, in the person of Thor. The catch is that SG1 has to also save the Asgard. The battle against the replicators is fairing poorly. They have lost their home world. The trap they had set did not work. They want SG1 to fix the problem. They had constructed a bomb to slow down time around the replicators. The idea is that hundreds of years would pass for the rest of the universe while moments passed for the replilcators. Hopefully, that would buy some breathing room. The problem is that the replicators found the device and reversed it. Time for them has passed at an incredible rate and the have evolved. The human role in this is to get to the planet and reverse the time bomb. The assumption is that human technology is so backward the replicators will not see it as a threat. <br /> <br />Sight Unseen - The SG1 crew brings back an artifact from an otherwise deserted planet. It is a high tech piece of equipment but nobody is sure exactly what it is. Not long after their return, Jonas sees an alien bug flit through a wall but nobody else sees it. They think he is crazy until they start seeing bugs as well. It turns out that the device was used by the ancients to study life in other dimensions. It's only used to see; the bugs have no access to our world. The problem is that those who come into contact with the machine start seeing the things. So do those who come into contact with anyone who has been in contact with the machine. This leads to widespread sightings in the civilian community and the SG1 team has to figure a way to contain the secret and reverse the process. <br /> <br />Smoke & Mirrors - The sleazy senator is back. He's back until the first few minutes of the show when he is assassinated. All the evidence, including videotapes, show that Col. O'Neill is the assassin and he is arrested for the murder. It is up to the rest of the SG1 team to clear him but they have very little to work with. Among the clues are memories of the mimic devices aliens used in the episode, FOOTHOLD, to impersonate earth personnel. The other clue is an admission from an NID agent that there is corruption there. As always, money increases the sleaze factor, especially with politicians. What's worse, the sleazy SOB's get even worse when they are cleared. <br /> <br />Paradise Lost - Harry Mayborne, the former NID colonel in hiding, turns up in Col. O'Neill's backyard. He is tired of living on the run and wants a pardon. He says that he has the key to a secret cache of alien technology and weapons located when the NID was running its illicit Stargate program. He agrees to help the SG1 team locate it only if he can go along. The deal sounds too good to be true but Mayborne has been semi-trustworthy in the past so they agree to take him. When they get to the planet and the \\"doorway\\", he does have the \\"key\\" device. Instead of just opening it, though, he tries to zap everyone and go through the doorway by himself. Col. O'Neill goes through right on hisheels. It turns out that Mayborne thought he was escaping to a sort of paradise. Its true that he couldn't stand running anymore but there never was a hidden cache. Now both of the colonels are marooned in very primitive circumstances with no way to get back. The paradise shows signs of former habitation but nobody is alive there. The SGC cannot locate them and a native plant is causing Mayborne to lose his mind. O'Neill has a hard time not shooting him just on general principles. <br /> <br />Metamorphosis - The Russian SG team comes home with a desperately sick human. The human claims that his race is being wiped out by the ghoul, Nerti. A rescue team goes out led by SG1 and finds a bunch of people who regard Nerti as a goddess who is healing them of a terrible plague. In truth, though, she is the cause of their problems she is using the local peoples as guinea pigs while trying to develop an improved model host. She is changing them drastically and they are dying without her treatments. They are also dying with them. The SG1 team wants to rescue these people but they don't want to be rescued. Instead, they demonstrate telekinetic abilities and capture the SG1 team for further use in Nerti's experiments.  <br /> <br />Disclusure - It looks like some of the episodes were running over budget so it was time for a retrospective episode that is made primarily of old footage with minimal new material. Gen. Hammond leads a briefing at the Pentagon for selected foreign ambassadors. In it, he discloses the existence of the Stargate program and makes a pitch for international cooperation in fighting the ghouls but wants the program to remain secret to prevent panic. The ambassadors can hardly believe what they are hearing and, even after they believe, are eager to publicize the program for political advantage. They are aided in this by the slimy senator who sees this as an opportunity to gain control over the program for his own ends. The episode is mostly a bunch of flashbacks as the General and the senator argue about the merits of USAF control. <br /> <br />Forsaken - While investigating a new planet, the SG1 team finds a crashed ship with three human survivors. They are human and are more technically advanced than earth but they have no knowledge of the Stargate system. While discussing with the stranded humans the possibility of fixing the ship, they are all attacked by other aliens. The marooned spacefarers say that these other are barbarians who have been killing and eating them but the colonel is suspicious. He is especially so when they insist on killing all the aliens they encounter and refuse to try and take prisoners. Not all is as it seems. <br /> <br />The Changeling - This is a strange one with more overtones of budgetary problems. Throughout most of it, Teal'c bounces back and forth between being a firefighter (the rest of the SG1 team are other parts of the crew) and being a member of SG1, but with things not quite as they should be. In each state, he thinks he is dreaming and that the other state is the \\"real\\" one. In each state, he is giving up vital body parts to keep his old mentor, Bray'tac alive. In all states, he gets visited by Daniel Jackson. I say that this one seems low budget not because it is poorly done, but because firefighter sets cost much less than the extravagant Stargate sets. It is otherwise well done, if a little confusing at first.  <br /> <br />Memento - The SG1 team is assigned as liaison to the newly commissioned Prometheus ship, the one introduced at the end of the last season as humanity's first starship. They are simple there as advisors, not in a command capacity. While on their maiden voyage, there is a problem with the hyperdrive and no spare parts are on board. They are too far to reach earth and too far from their destination to get help their. Jonas notices that they have popped out of hyperspace near a planet for which they have reason to believe a Stargate exists. They have never been able to reach the planet and surmise that the gate is buried. They decide to go looking for it. The natives are suspicious. The president wants to help them and the military leader thinks they are bent on conquest. They all think of the gate as a myth. The SG1 team and the Prometheus find themselves stuck in the middle of competing political factions and worldviews. It's a good one. <br /> <br />Prophecy - The SG1 team visits a planet where the human population is enslaved by a minor ghoul who is forcing them to mine naqueda. The team is ready to help them throw off the ghoul yoke but there are a couple of problems. Jonas is starting to have accurate visions of the future. The problem is knowing which way to act. This condition seems to be the result of a brain tumor inflicted by one of Nerti's eugenics experiments. The tumor looks like it is going to kill him. Meanwhile, back on the planet, one of the human slaves wants to be a good little toady and gain favor from the ghoul. He betrays SG1. The problem is figuring how to act in light of Jonas' predictions. <br /> <br />Full Circle - While riding the elevator at SG1, Col. O'Neill has encounter with Daniel Jackson who warns him that Anubis is on his way to Abydos to retrieve an extremely powerful artifact, the Eye of Ra. Jackson warns that with the Eye, Anubis will become too powerful to confront. O'Neill is worried that everyone will think he is crazy because Daniel has \\"ascended\\". They believe him because many of the others have run into Daniel as well. Daniel finally decides to take a stand and help the earth team. In doing so he makes a deal with Anubis to prevent the destruction of Abydos. That is semantically equal to saying he made a deal with the devil. Anubis has been a shadowy figure all season but in this one we learn a little more about him. Its not pretty. On the plus side, it looks like Daniel will be back next season. Also, some more strange plot lines are in store for the future.  <br />
0767827791|5.0|Hal Carter (played by William Holden), a former college football star, is now down and out and arrives in a small town in Kansas, riding a boxcar on the railroad, his main possession is a fancy pair of boots.  It is early Labor Day morning.  He finds some yardwork with Mrs. Potts (played by Verna Felton) to earn his breakfast and inquires about an old college frat brother and roommate, Alan Benson (played by Cliff Robertson) who lives in town.  He discovers that Alan's father runs the corporation owning the local grain elevators, and Alan has a girlfriend, Madge Owens (played by Kim Novak) who lives right next door to Mrs. Potts, along with her mother Flo (played by Betty Field), younger sister Millie (played by Susan Strasberg), and the schoolteacher Miss Sydney (played by Rosalind Russell) who boards with them.<br /><br />Madge never did well in school (Millie chaims they almost had to burn the school down to get her out), but she is good looking and her mother wants her to get a man while she is still young and attractive.  Millie is a tomboy who is doing well in school, hopes for a college scholarship, and claims she has no interest in \\"boys.\\"<br /><br />Events lead to Hal taking Millie to the labor day picnic along with Alan who takes Madge.  This is Millie's first time out with a man, and she dresses up, casting off her tomboy image.  Miss Sydney goes with her friend Howard (played by Oscar nominee Arthur O'Connell).  Everything is going well, and everyone is having an afternoon of fun but Howard has brought along a bottle of whiskey in a brown paper bag.  As afternoon turns into night, people start losing some inhibitions.  Madge starts dancing with Hal.  Miss Sydney, now somewhat drunk, tries to cut in.  Millie, feeling neglected, sneaks some of the whiskey and gets drunk.  Harsh words are exchanged between various individuals.  Hal is unjustly blamed for all the problems.  Alan rejects Hal as a friend and tells the police that Hal stole his car.  There is a side plot with Miss Sydney wanting to drag Howard into a marriage.<br /><br />The next morning Hal feels he needs to make a quick departure from town, the morning freight train is coming through, but nothing will be the same again.  Madge doesn't really like Alan (a man should learn that a woman may look at him unfavorably if he criticizes another man in front of her), and wants to go after Hal.  Flo thinks Madge is losing her big chance with Alan (a local poohbah), who could give her a nice home, a car, charge accounts, etc. (things Flo always dreamed about).  Poor Howard finds himself being dragged into a marriage, and doesn't know what hit him (Miss Sydney is a take-charge type woman).  Millie seems to put aside sibling rivalry at the end.<br /><br />Overall it is a great motion picture.  The action takes place over 24 hours, from one morning to the next.  I have the widescreen version, and the film quality is great.<br /><br />As a note on previous reviews, be careful where you buy things.  Some retailers (I won't name names) have been caught in the past selling pirated goods.  Pirated goods have an unknown quality.  If you buy from Amazon, you know your source.  If you happen to get a bad copy from Amazon, they will replace it at no cost (or refund your money if it came from a secondary source listed on Amazon).Miss Sydney wanting to drag Howard into a marriage.

B0008237BY|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best hip hop/rap cd ever released. It's better than Paid In Full, Ready To Die, or Illmatic. Sure, those albums are all considered classics but this album is still better. It has so much truth and heart, how could it not be the best? Any rapper can use multisyllabe flows, or paint vivid descriptions, but few could speak from the heart like 2pac could. This album shows people that 2pac wasn't just the weary remorseful rapper on Me Against The World nor was he completely the thug rapper on All Eyez On Me. This a great example of the duality of man and how we all feel different feelings. Few rappers could so easily describe feeling sad to angry to in love to suicidal like 2pac could. This is what makes this album better than all other hip hop/rap albums released.
B0002X314C|2.0|I expected more because of all the hype surrounding the CD. OK, the last seven songs are decent, with Ordinary People being exceptional, but that's about it. Vocally, John Legend is kinda weak. Definitely not the best voice I've heard. The first seven songs are pretty shallow and superficial - like much of what's out there in the R & B music world today with very little exception. Maybe he included them to appeal to a broader audience. Too bad. If you like spending your hard-earned money to listen to only half a CD, then buy it. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money on this one.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Yes, I'm a fan. I'm trying to spread the signal through all of my own. I can't rave about how much I love Serenity and Firefly, which I just discovered only a few months ago thanks to suggestions based on my ratings on Netflix. I have tons going on in my life right now, but for some reason, this little bit of entertainment keeps bringing me back to the TV for a review every few days. Gives me time to listen to the cunning dialogue while working on my art, I guess. Oh, and it doesn't hurt to look at all the pretty people as well. Every damn one. Even that hair on Shepard kinda has it's appeal. Well, not as much as the others, but you get the drift. Believe me. Try out this adventure. If you liked Star Trek, if you liked Dune, if you liked the Fifth Element, LOTR, Independence Day...or if you're a person who appreciates nice lookin' folk who talk with pleasin' wit...checkit. You won't be disappointed. Joss is brilliant. I hear of another project with Firefly in the makin', frak if don't absoutely lay down on the floor in convulsions.
B000002LK1|5.0|This album is by far my favorite album from my collection period. I am obsessed with Depeche Mode, i have all their albums and Violator is the one that spends the most time in my CD player. From \\"World in my Eyes\\" to \\"Clean\\" i can't find myself skipping any track. This album would definetly be my choice as a first DM purchase. If you just gave this album a shot and listen to it with an open mind, i promise you would be nodding your head singing along. Even my friends gave into this album, and they're hard metal and punk heads. Here is my favourite tracks in the album order.  <br /> <br />1. World in my Eyes (1st) Awsome!! David never sounded better i love the ending. <br />2. Sweetest Perfection (3rd) My favourite song sang by Martin.  <br />yes!! Martin sings this one! <br />3. Personal Jesus (5th) The song that everyone is familiar with. <br />This song sounds awsome if you have a sub, especially towards the end of the song.  <br />4. Halo (4th) Their darkest song of the album. This should have been a single. <br />5. Waiting for the Night (8th) Softest song, it might make you wanna call your girl or significant other. <br />6. Enjoy the Silence (2nd) What a hit. No way you're not going to like this song. Everyones favourite for sure. <br />7. Policy of Truth (9th) My least favourite, i don't know why. We all have our different taste. <br />8. Blue Dress (6th) Another by Martin. Beautiful song and vocals. <br />9. Clean (7th) Perfect finisher! Although this is the kind of track that Martin would be better at singing.  <br />   <br />There you go. Violator. The Best DM album. After Violator i would suggest on picking up Black Celebration, then Music for the Masses, then Ultra, then Some Great Reward, then Playing the Angel, then Songs of Faith and Devotion, then Construction Time Again, then Speak and Spell, then Exciter, and finally A Broken Frame. I wouldn't suggest the singles.  <br />  <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|I pranced into this film at the local Carmike thinking it would be similar to Lonesome Dove...or at least the Lonesome Dove prequal:  Dead Man's Walk (the David Arquette one).  What I got was sooooooo much better.  I never expected an epic love story that would bring tears to my eyes and change my life forever.  The story is multidimensional and I learn something new with every viewing.  I can't wait for the DVD or the local Maxi Saver to begin showing the film.  By the way, David Hasslehoff's song, Hot Shot City, is particulary good.
B000001FTD|5.0|Back when I was a mere 14 and had the big hair like so many of my time I picked up this tape ( yes tape young ones). I picked it up because I liked the video caught in the mosh on head bangers ball. I considered myself lucky if I liked 3 songs on any tape I picked up in those years, I really liked all the songs on ATL everyone was just fast heavy and musical, very fun. Best of all for me, I picked up Stephen Kings The Stand after hearing ATL (the songs based on the book) , unbelievable book. So, if you like your metal fast, heavy, and fun this is a great buy.
B0007ORU66|5.0|If you think of the original albums as separate works and not just collections of songs, this is a very special album with unusual songs from Paul (\\"Paperback Writer\\"; \\"Lady Madonna\\"), from John (\\"Rain\\"; \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\"; \\"Don't Let Me Down\\"), and from George (\\"Old Brown Shoe\\").  And it is exciting to hear the older tunes (\\"I Should Have Known Better\\"; \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\") on the same album with the then current heavyweight hits (\\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Revolution\\").  Sometimes, as with this album, it is worthwhile to hear the songs as they were collected before the digital era.
630529142X|1.0|Not funny, not very entertaining. Uninspired comedy. Lines that aren't worth repeating. If one more person says \\"you can do it\\" I'm gonna rub my eyes and shake my head while I curse them in my mind. Do not buy this movie if you haven't seen it. Billy Madison is hilarious. Happy Gilmore, great comedy. Big Daddy--I loved it. Mr. Deeds--didn't see it, never will unless I'm stoned. 50 First Dates--Pleasantly surprised, it was hilarious. The Waterboy--ranks at the bottom of Adam Sandler's career.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|I loved this movie - especially that song they played while driving around in their little Mini Cars.  Can anyone tell me what the name of that song is? its not on the CD soundtrack. :(  Oh well - I hightly recomend this movie - the original movie was also good but this one was so much fun to watch - have seen it about 8 times now....(hint trying to find out about that song!) <br /> <br />
B00003CXXP|3.0|Okay, enough with all the symbolism talk here. This is a good, creative, entertaining movie, but the last 45 minutes suck. Why didn't it just end with the helicopter at the bottom of the ocean. How long will he last down there, alone, afraid? That would've summed it up nicely, but no, Steve has to put the whip cream on top, add some cherries, and then some caramel sauce, and then some nuts, and then more cherries, and so on. Did they have to bring in computer generated aliens at the end? I hate it when they do that! Anyway, if you haven't seen it, I would suggest renting it, but if you do buy it, the last part will annoy you.
140004281X|3.0|This was an okay book.  I'm not really into short stories.  I only read it because it had gotten such good reviews.  It is a book about life and life experiences and because of this it is slightly depressing.
B0001IN0DA|4.0|The anticipation was high for this event. I couldn't wait until the day to see this PPV. It was a great night of course, as this event well exceeding my expectations as to what I was looking forward to seeing. I truly has begun again in every since of the word. Let's take a look back @ the event that was Wrestlemania XX. Here's my review:<br /><br />Disc One Program<br /><br />U.S. Title Match: John Cena vs. The Big Show, *1/2 (An average match, even though the crowd was into this one. Worth a look to see Cena win the US title for the first time.)<br /><br />RAW World Tag Team Title Match: Booker T & Rob Van Dam vs. The Dudleys vs. La Resistance vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade, ** (Even though the tag team division is beyond dead in the WWE, this was a fairly good match, but nothing to write home about.)<br /><br />Christian vs. Chris Jericho, ***1/2 (An extremely good match between these two. Trish's turn @ the end was a shocker by the way.)<br /><br />Ric Flair, Batista & Randy Orton vs. The Rock & Mick Foley, ****1/4 (In what has to be the best handicap match ever, all 5 of these men had their working boots on for this match.)<br /><br />Playboy Evening Gown Match: Torrie Wilson & Sable vs. Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie, DUD (I'm pretty sure that the male fans will find this one entertaining. But for the workrate fans, feel free to skip this one.)<br /><br />Cruiserweight Open: Chavo Guerrero, Jamie Noble, Funaki, Ultimo Dragon, Rey Mysterio, Nunzio, Tajiri, Shannon Moore & Billy Kidman, **(Wow, this could've been a classic if they played it right.

1400032717|5.0|A murder mystery about a dog, written in the first person from the perspective of an autistic boy? Yes, but that hardly describes the true depth of this book, which is much less about a dead dog and more about a real life, a life filled with complications, imperfect people, and no clear resolutions or happy endings. And it's about how Christopher, an autistic boy, thinks, and it describes his thought process in a way that makes sense.<br /><br />You start to really understand why he's so literal-minded, why he has trouble negotiating everyday social interactions, and what is really going on his head. You feel compassion and admiration for this brave, bright boy, but never pity. Instead, you start to feel the frustration he does, as the people around him react with anger, contempt, or derision because they don't understand him, while you, as the reader, can see that everything he says and does makes PERFECT sense inside his own head.<br /><br />Reading this book will give you a greater understanding of autism, but it does so without being moralistic or maudlin. Above all, it's a well-written, interesting story in which the details of the main character's actions and thoughts are more interesting than the events, which for the most part are quite mundane.<br /><br />All of the characters are believable. Christopher's parents are loving but flawed. They do their best to cope with their difficult, frustrating son and his special needs, but they are not the noble, selfless guardians you'd find in a TV movie who never lose patience or snap or find themselves unable to cope. They do lose lose patience, they do snap, they do things they regret because caring for an autistic child is SO HARD, but still they remain sympathetic, and when they make mistakes, you know that there are very few parents who'd do any better.<br /><br />This would be an excellent addition to most schools' reading lists, but adults will find it a worthwhile read as well.<br /><br />One final comment: the book is set in England, and it has a very English feel, which actually made it even more colorful to me as an American. Also, I listened to it as an audiobook, and the (British) narrator was EXCELLENT, perfectly capturing the tone of every single character's voice and making all of Christopher's thoughts sound straightforward and sensible and true to his character. It actually makes me wonder if reading this book rather than listening to it would cause you to miss out on some of the experience.comment: the book is set in England, and it has a very English feel, which actually made it even more colorful to me as an American.

068987474X|4.0|I love how Greg put on paper what I have thought ever since I saw that episode of Sex and the City where Carries boyfriend Berger tells Miranda Hes just not that into you about a guy she went on a date with. I honestly only recently found out there was an actual book about it. That episode changed my view forever. I also started dating the year of that episode, and noticed that, the guys I wanted werent calling me back, the guy I let get too close physically too soon, didnt want me, the guy that gave me his number but didnt call me back, OR take my calls didnt want me, but why?  <br /> <br />I just recently broke up with someone, we were together a year and ahalf, lived together for a lot of it, he broke up with me, I moved out, kept in touch, trying to do the friend thing, but ultimately, it is just not going to work out.  <br /> <br />Hes the Water Colored Memories guy. [you know which one im talking about if you have read the book] And I am hanging onto this friendship, but slowing down the process of getting over him. I will only be hurt in the long run because he will start dating other women, and I will freak out that hes moved on before me...And I will be mad that he hasnt fallen in love with me all over again by just being friends me. WHat this book says is, MOVE ON. Try out someone new, who WANTS to be with you, but dont waste your time sitting, hoping and waiting. If he wanted to be with me, he would do everything in his power to be with me.  I honestly believe that. <br /> <br />I dont think you should have to play games with guys, and that is not what this book is about. <br /> <br />This book is about realizing that we as women should NEVER doubt our self-worth. EVER under any cicumstances.  <br /> <br />Every woman has different values, but ultimately, in the end, we are all a lot alike in the way we obsess and over analyze things that really are NOT worth it! Guys are NOT overly complicated beings. We are the complicated ones.  <br /> <br />Okay Im starting to ramble I think you get the point, but I am definitely going to check out his other book, and pay attention to whatever this guy Greg has to say in the future. Im considering this book my dating bible.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Hilarious comedy-sized, er, \\"lungs\\" aside, Lord knows what we've done to deserve Mariah Carey over the years. True, the whole \\"Glitter\\" debacle was fun, (always nice to see a \\"diva\\" self-destruct) but now, sadly, she's selling records by the shed load again. And God alone knows why.<br /><br />Throughout the charts, you'd be hard pushed to find a more cold, clinical approach to apparently soulful music. Mariah seems to think that just because she CAN hit such high notes, she has to do it in every single song, where it only further detracts from any sense of realism or depth. The music is rubbish to begin with, of course, with laughable, cliched syrupy love nonsense that is so bland and uninspired you imagine she only retreats into her high pitched wails and yelps to get away from singing them. Worse still, she's now further into her \\"ghetto\\" image, so instead of standing around with people who she normally would cross the street to avoid, she's also now attempting to sound like them. Newsflash - it doesn't work.<br /><br />Of course, these rappers are here to provide street cred, but these people are bought more easily than the bling they're obsessed with. It's not a sign of how much they respect her as an artist, it's a sign that her record company can afford them.<br /><br />Anyway, it's garbage. Mariah Carey stopped making good records.. well, after her first single, actually. This is another in the long line of bad ones, and you can't help but pray that \\"Mimi\\" is banged up and shipped straight back to the slave ships.<br /><br />(...)
B000E1YVZU|4.0|I fell in love with RENT the stage musical when I saw it during my college years in Chicago (1995-1999).  I've seen it 4 times on stage and loved each performance.  I wasn't fortunate enough to see the Orignal Broadway Cast on stage, but I know their musical soundtrack backwards and forwards.  I often find myself sing a song out of the blue to make the time fly by, especially at work.  When I heard that they finally made a movie version of my fave musical, I knew I'd be there to see it opening weekend. <br /> <br />What RENT the movie has going for it is that most of the original Broadway cast has been reassembled.  The voices that I love from the Broadway soundtrack are here in this film.  The film itself was well done.  The look and feel of the East Village was captured beautifully.  The film took some liberties with the time frame of the first half of the story but it was necessary for the film's pacing.  Everyone gave good performances in the film.  The power of the story really comes alive and grabs you on film much more so than it does on stage.  There is just so much more you can do on film than on stage.  However, not everything on stage translates well to film.  Luckily, RENT is one property that has translated well IMO. <br /> <br />The major downside for me was that Daphne Rubin Vega did not play Mimi.  Rosario Dawson does a nice job acting wise, but her voice is nowhere near as powerful or passionate as Daphne's.  Songs like Out Tonight and Without You suffer IMO from Rosario's \\"soft\\" voice.  Also, one of my favorite numbers, \\"Christmas Bells\\", was not included in the film.  However, with the needed story pacing change of the first act,  cutting the number was understandable.  Other than that, I loved the movie.  I'm so excited to get this on DVD.
0385507755|1.0|I read this after all the fraud information came to light so I read it as it really was -- a work of fiction.  It stunk.  If the book had actually been true it would have been good only because it was amazing that all of that could really happen.  But since I know it's all fake, I read it as a fantasy and it really stunk.  Those defenders who say it doesn't matter whether it is true are speaking nonsense.  There are far better and far better written works of ficiton out there that should be read before this second rate act.  All of this fraud indicates James Frey has some real probelmns -- just not the ones he made up in the book.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|There have been enough \\"book\\" length reviews here for this dvd.Suffice it to say,the implications of this movie are staggering.Keep in mind the defense attorney,who defended Father Moore,life changed because of this case...And she is,I believe, the one responsible for this film.Do yourself a favor and get it.
B00005JO04|5.0|Gagan's ideas based film -- while lacking the visual virtuosity of Traffic -- raises some very interesting questions indeed. But all is lost to a collective audience who thinks the \\"24\\" is complex and challenging or \\"Crash\\" is deep... <br /> <br />It seems that the US audience are so used to \\"film as pure sensory entertainment\\" that it infuriated them when nothing is resolved. I find most \\"bad reviews\\" (either here or in the press) are laced with misinformation, xenophobia, partisanship bias and juvenille comments. It is unfortunate that doing a narratively complex film offering an alternative view (esp. regarding terrorism) would incite more hate and ignorance as opposed to dialogue.  <br /> <br />I find the film to be very well made and the issues it raises are very interesting (esp to those informed in Network systems and the Chaos theory), to a certain extent, Matt Damon, the actor and the narrative his character carries is the weakest part of film and is what I assume a concession to the joe q public --  to present the point of view of an \\"Average Joe\\".  <br /> <br />Syriana stands proudly alongside The Insider, The Constant Gardner, Traffic and to a lesser extent, Munich (which wraps its ideology in easy to digest Thriller genre conventions ) in honoring the \\"New Cinema\\" of the 70s when filmmakers pushed against the grain, but unlike the 70s, there is no longer an like-minded audience (except for the critics) here in the States. I would predict the film to do a lot better in the rest of the world.

They say: \\"This is great, this is adventurous! (And besides, everyone is doing it.)\\". <br /> <br />No. <br />Don't we have the original tune (Kraftwerk: Computer Love) still playing somewhere in our thoughts? <br />As for Kraftwek.

B0007Y08IS|2.0|An animated film featuring marionettes rather than cel drawings and computer-generated graphics, \\"Team America: World Police\\" is that rare movie satire that leans Right rather than Left in its politics - although the sheer vulgarity of much of the imagery and dialogue may make it as detestable to conservatives as it is to liberals.  In a way, I have to admire a film that isn't afraid to offend people on either side of the political spectrum, but \\"Team America\\" simply isn't a very good film, offering little in the way of intelligent satire or pointed humor.<br /><br />Written by Trey Parker, Pam Brady and Matt Stone, and directed by Parker, \\"Team America: World Police\\" involves a group of highly trained youngsters who battle the forces of global terrorism in the name of the good old U S of A.  Gary Johnston is a highly successful Broadway actor whom the organization recruits to go undercover and infiltrate terrorist cells in the Middle East.<br /><br />The makers of \\"Team America\\" certainly show guts in being willing to exploit this sensitive subject for comic purposes, but they really go over the top in portraying Leftist Hollywood celebrities such as Alec Baldwin, Sean Penn, Matt Damon, Tim Robbins, George Clooney, Helen Hunt, Danny Glover, Ethan Hawke, Susan Sarandon and others as actually being on the side of the terrorists.  Heck, they even have Michael Moore blowing up a building as a suicide bomber.  It's one thing to attack these people for their politics, but it's quite another to portray them as sympathetic to mass murderers.  It also makes for lousy satire because it lacks the truth and precision satire needs to be truly effective.  It would be no less wrong if a liberal filmmaker were to do the same with the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly and others.  The targets also seem lightweight and skewed.  Why not go after the politicians who actually create and implement the policies that directly relate to global terrorism rather than a bunch of mouthy celebrities who really have little effect on what goes on in the world?<br /><br />Still, this might have been palatable if the film at least had managed to be funny, but \\"Team America\\" really doesn't provide much in the laugh department.  The romantic relationships between the main characters are trite and silly, and the voiceover imitations of the real-life characters are poor in the extreme.  I guess this film works if you have an interest in incredibly graphic puppet sex, marionette projectile vomiting and the gruesome dismemberment and killing of some of filmdom's most famous celebrities.  Otherwise, I can't see much reason for watching it.<br /><br />The Right might still manage to get an effective satire together someday.  But \\"Team America\\" sure isn't it.m rather than a bunch of mouthy celebrities who really have little effect on what goes on in the world? <br /> <br />Still, this might have been palatable if the film at least had managed to be funny, but \\"Team America\\" really doesn't provide much in the laugh department.

0812550706|5.0|this book is a great book for anyone. it kept me reading even when I should have been reviewing another book that was needed for a quiz read for a quiz this book is good because if your a Sci-Fi fan it gives you another interesting subject to talk about I know many people who think this book is great they are all between the ages of 13-18 but that does not mean younger kids can't read it because of hard words since there are none or adults can not read it because they think its childish no its a great book and I would suggest it to anyone 9 years or older the reason I think this book is so good more of the fact on how he doesn't lose the reader by saying to many descriptions so no one gets lost and has to re read many times also he keeps the story exciting at all time because ender is always surrounded by enemy's and usually not his age and they do have twists through out the book to keep the reader reading like when Ender knew he was going to be attacked by these thirteen year olds but he never saw it coming nor did anyone else I know that it would happen in the shower and not by 6 people most probably thought just by one and the twist was that he didn't even get injured at all he killed the other boy and the other 5 didn't do anything to stop him so in conclusion I think this is a good book and if you haven't read this book yet you better start reading it.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Elf is a Christmas story with a twist.      The twist is provided, in the midst of a cute Christmas story, by the writing of Jon Favreau and the performance of Will Ferrell.  The movie manages to stay innocent, while still allowing Will to be expressive with his natural brand of humor.  It's a Christmas movie that everyone can enjoy, children and adults alike, as it appeals to both the kid in all of us, as well as our more adult sensibilities.      The Infinifilm edition includes 2 discs: One contains the Widescreen version and special features and the other contains the Full Screen version and special features.  There is plenty on the interactive DVDs to keep you busy for quite a while, including quality featurettes, deleted scenes, games you (or the kids) can play, commentaries and even DVD-rom features.    This is a new favorite to add to the Christmas list.
B0009S3HI0|5.0|First of all, I watched the DVD about 10 times.  I love it...  I just wish there was more.  But not in a way that leaves me feeling unsatisfied but in a \\"I just can't get enough of the Deftones\\" way.  All their vids are on there plus some goofing around behind the scenes sillyness which are my favorite parts.<br /><br />Second, if you're a HUGE 'Tones fan, you'll love the album just as much as the DVD.  If you like the 'Tones but aren't completely insane about them than you might (might being the key word) not dig this album since it doesn't really have the type of sound the Deftones are known for.  It's a little more mellow than what one would expect from these guys.<br /><br />I love having this in my collection for a few reasons: One, I'm a tried and true, die hard Deftones fan. Two, it proves quite well that they can totally pull off covering songs that aren't their typical \\"style\\" and three, it's just a good cd that I don't get tired of listening to.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|...it makes me wonder what was taking them so long.  I can only imagine that it was a legal issue.    Now that's it here, however, I am horrendously disappointed.  The previous review claims that it's \\"remastered?\\"  Well, the sound may have been \\"mixed\\" into a 5.1 sound field (and badly done at that), but the picture is still in the same horrific condition as the ORIGINAL DVD release.    You don't have to look any further then the Guild ship landing at the beginning of the movie.  Look at the lower left-hand side of the screen and watch the inexplicable shadow artifacts that keep fading in and out...as if the original film were compromised.  No, it's not one of those \\"oh, you really have to look close\\" things, either; it's actually annoyingly, painfully obvious!!    You don't even have to go THAT far to look for transfer problems!!  Look at the Universal logo on the opening reel and \\"oooooo\\" and \\"ahhhhhh\\" at the dust specks and scratches on the film.      ALL THIS TIME, and it's for a film that sports a couple of docs, an extended edition that STILL doesn't have completed effects (you can tell where some of the deleted scenes are without knowing the film that well - the Fremen's eyes aren't colored in), and a release that goes the extra mile to be as cheap as possible by sporting a DOUBLE-SIDED DISC to cut down on manufacturing costs.    If you've already seen the extended release shown on the Sci-Fi channel, base your decision to buy this based on your feelings towards what was shown there because there is no difference here.     5 stars for the movie; 1 star for this release and for Universal making Dune fans froth at the mouth after many inexplicable delays...for no good reason at all.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a natural born skeptic.... However, After viewing the first 11 episodes of the box set I must say that I am an addict.... Or that is.... I would be if FOX had not canceled this truly outstanding show.  Wheaton progressively adds on layers of compelling character development and interaction episode by episode... in such a way that the story gradually just draws you in.... What a shame that Fox didn't give the show the time to build the inevitable fan base necessary to make it a hit....
B000002L9Y|5.0|This album is great from beginning to end. It is like a greatest hits. Even the non hits (ie Family Man) are great. There are no weaknesses at all. A must for any Mac fan. Even non fans would enjoy this album.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|For once a series where all of the characters were interesting and well acted (even minor ones), with intelligent and witty dialog.  The stories were well crafted, and each developed the characters a bit further, bit by bit.  All the characters are flawed and human, which is what makes them so intriguing.  I only discovered Firefly after seeing Serenity in the theater - both of them were terrific, and I'm sad that there's no more episodes or movies to see.  Hopefully the phenomenal response to the TV series on DVD, as well as good movie sales on DVD will resurrect the show for another series, or even another movie, even if it is made for TV.  Fingers crossed.
B000026FOA|5.0|This is simply the best music that has ever been recorded. Your life will be better if you buy it.
B000AADYRQ|1.0|It's clear that DCFC has sold out.  How you say, because this is a major label debut and they are an indie-band and the two just don't mix (think oil and water).   <br /> <br />I really like this album, it's got a really neat sound throughout the entire album.  I would recommend this to most anyone that likes pop/rock music.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This was the best movie i have ever seen. The story is amazing, the scenery is amazing, the acting is fantastic. Words cannot describe how people feel about this movie. Never has there been a love story like this, and nothing can copy it. Whether it is about a gay couple or not, it was an amazing love story.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|Being a fan of Grimm's Fairy Tales and the Grimm Brothers, I originally thought this movie was going to be the life story of the Brothers Grimm and how they got their inspirations for their re-telling of old, classic tales (in a similar style to the movie Finding Neverland). It WASN'T! The movie made the Grimm Brothers out to be like they're idiotic con-men turned action heroes, not to mention that it shifted WAY too much into the fantasy spectrum (in which they come upon a real magical forest with moving trees and such). This movie was way too unrealistic for me and I didn't stick around to see the rest of it because I was so disappointed. So if those of you are under the impression that this movie is based on the true-life story of the Grimm Brothers (like I was), it is NOT. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.
B000B8QF00|5.0|I've followed Alanis Morissette since her first 2 commercially released albums \\"Alanis\\" in '91 and \\"Now is the time\\" in '92.  I've always loved her voice and expected a come-back since the \\"NITT\\" CD...but she took a 3-year break and came back with a new image, voice and talent with \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" in '95. Since then, she's pumped out song after song, singing & voicing her own opinions, musically. I'm proud to live in a Country where we can have fantastic talent such as Alanis Morissette. Some really talented artists come from Ottawa, Canada...and I'm mighty proud to play their music. Alanis Rocks!<br /><br />\\"The Collection\\" brings out Alanis' best, although, there are some songs which could've been included. There will always be compilations which don't have all the goodies of an artist on it. Forget about what this CD doesn't have and think about its good points...which are countless. The photos are lovely and the tracklist is pleasing to the ears. For one reason, Alanis' selection of songs puts the listener on a musical roller-coaster of emotions, whether it's a dark song or something really fast & happy.<br /><br />My all-time favorite track has to be \\"Uninvited\\". For one, because it wasn't released on an album. Two, I like it because of the drama & the way Alanis' voice goes so well with the arrangements...starting with the organ & piano. Really nice! \\"Crazy\\" is a fine song & excellent choice for Alanis. I didn't think she would choose this song for her compilation...perhaps because I never heard it until playing this CD. The only Alanis albums I've got are her first 3 + the unofficial biography & fully-illustrated book. \\"Crazy\\" is right up there with Seal's version...and I like Alanis' version better. More emotion is put into it.<br /><br />The first time I've heard \\"Let's do it (let's fall in love)\\"...I heard it sung by Eartha Kitt. Strange mix (eartha kitt & alanis morissette...huh?) Well, a true music lover will try anything once. I can't say I hate Eartha Kitt, but her music isn't anything near Alanis'. Alanis has given new life to \\"Let's do it...\\" and it's refreshing to find such a track on \\"The Collection\\".<br /><br />Thank you, for not removing the F word from \\"You Oughta Know\\".

B000294SFW|5.0|I have listened to motorhead for almost 20 years. I own the box set Deaf Forever, and several used up old tapes of albums. But this Album is the best work yet in my humble opinion. If you like motorheads older stuff buy this one you will not be disappointed....if you just like real metal, the way it is supposed to be YOU NEED this CD!
0312958455|4.0|This is the fourth Harry Bosch mystery. For me, this is the best of the lot so far. I am reading them in the order they were published and have found that THE LAST COYOTE is also the best novel so far. Michael Connelly just keeps getting better and better. Harry Bosch, detective, is put on leave and, with the involuntary free time, decides he wants to solve the murder of his mother, which occurred when he was a boy. Bosch must contend with an intrusive psychologist who is evaluating his fitness to return to duty, internal investigators who have his number and killers intent on eliminating everyone involved. As much a psychological study as a police procedural, the reader gets further insight into Bosch's character in THE LAST COYOTE. Using just the right mixture of action, authentic-sounding dialogue, characterization and police procedures, Mr. Connelly delivers another good novel of perhaps the last coyote on the LAPD, Harry Bosch.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|Simply using the word \\"bad\\" to describe this movie cannot convey to you exactly how horrific it actually is. \\"Bad\\" is a severe understatement. It's profoundly bad. It's atrocious. I wish I could get a lobotomy to erase this horrendous piece of cinematic fecal matter from my mind. It is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. I originally wanted to see this movie because I love the fantasy genre and I'm a big fan of the real brothers Grimm, but I was sorely dissapointed. I mean, what's with the kid getting swallowed up by mud, turning into the gingerbread man, then biting her hand and exclaiming, \\"mmm, I taste good!\\" all about? Was that funny or something? A cobweb-spewing, child-eating monster horse? A villian who is in the movie for all of 5 minutes? Lame, lame, LAME! And don't even get me started on the completely unlikable, boring main characters. If, despite my scathing review, you still want to see this movie, here's a little money saving tip: Forego the trip to the video store and opt instead to continually bash your head into a wall until you bleed profusely and require medical attention. A concussion is far more entertaining than this godawful piece of garbage.

B000DN5W4I|4.0|plus points:     Having seen the new line-up on Sunday in Manchester UK, I was in two minds whether to buy this DVD .... there is no comparison between the melodic and awsome chops of Eric Czar compared to Mark Epstein (who is no more than an adequate bass player, and at times, imo, less than adequate). This DVD is the \\"old\\" line-up and therefore in my mind, already close to 5 stars    Great song selection, even better playing, good visuals. Very clear. Good colour. Eric Czar is as much a focal point of the band as Joe, and both front men are truely outstanding in their ability.    Minus points:    The tension in the band compared to the free DVD early in his career is noticeable ( although perhaps if I had not realised they were no longer together this may have not been so noticeable, or even noticeable at all ). You sense that Eric Czar was playing out of his skin for his CV!     The DVD contains a link to DTS audio, which does not work. Like the previous reviewer, this is a serious let-down, particularly as the link is there ... is it just my copy ?  So, stereo only for me ... still, it is very good sound    Joe Bonamassa is an awesome player, and this is reflected in the DVD. I have one gripe ... his stage presence has dropped off a great deal, and in Manchester there was very little rapport with the fans ... whats up Joe, are we not worth talking to ocassionally ? ... it makes us feel part of things !
0671027573|4.0|Four women, Jaine, TJ, Luna and Marci, always get together after work on Fridays for a beer, supper and girl talk at their favorite suburban Detroit bar. One Friday the talk is about men and, feeling good after a few drinks, they come up with a list of attributes they'd like in the perfect man. They list mostly personality traits, but also get into some physical traits as well. By Monday morning, the List is in the Company newsletter, in emails, and on the Internet. Soon local newspapers and TV stations have bumped it up to their national counterparts. Good Morning America tapes an interview. Obviously their little bit of fun has gotten totally out of control.<br /><br />Two weeks ago, Jaine moved into her first house and is trying to get used to her sometimes grungy, sometimes noisy, ever-the-hunk neighbor, Sam...a cop. They get off to a shaky start on neighborliness, but eventually begin to treat each other more kindly. With three broken engagements in her past, Jaine is wary of Sam's charms, but their relationship soon becomes more caring.<br /><br />The fun and games come to an end when Marci is found dead in her home, badly beaten about the face and stabbed. The other three women are getting mysterious phone calls. Then Jaine's house is ransacked. The nastiness doesn't end there. Is someone ticked about the List to the point of murder?<br /><br />Even though this is a mystery, the author writes with a wry sense of humor that had me laughing many times. The author has carefully woven a funny, sexy mystery that keeps you guessing for a while about whodunit.
0060763280|4.0|I was given this book as a gift and was greatly touched by it. Harv opens up a whole new way of thinking for those who take the time to not only read the book, but understand the concepts and feelings behind it.<br /><br />However, it did take a while for me to get into the book - that's why I gave it 4 stars - it starts out a bit on the \\"cult-like\\" edge which almost turned me off to the whole message. Nonetheless, I kept going as I'd heard so many good things about it and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Harv's style ultimately helped me discover the issues I've had with money to this point and has been pivotal in changing my thinking. Definitely worth reading.
B000002JKA|5.0|Dream Theater had a slow start with their debut release \\"When Dream and Day Unite\\" but (thankfully in my opinion) they changed lead singers to James LaBrie for their next release \\"Images and Words\\".  \\"Images and Words\\" was a huge success and made them house hold names to those who liked \\"Pull Me Under\\" from that album.  They especially were popular in Europe.  Next, riding their success they released \\"Awake\\".<br /><br />Many bands that suddenly found themselves popular try to duplicate their newfound success.  Thankfully Dream Theater was above that save for one item: they cut the track lengths to make them more commercially sucessful.  (There are only 2 songs over 6 minutes in length which means only 2 would have to be cut short to be played on the radio).<br /><br />There are a couple tracks that stand above the rest on this album.  \\"6:00\\" and \\"Caught In A Web\\" are those two songs.  Each was a success on the radio and helped Dream Theater grow even larger in Europe (including eastern Europe).  This album tends to be a little heavier than \\"Images and Words\\" was but is still a great quality album to be enjoyed over and over again.
B0009R1T7M|3.0|While I lambaste the professional critics that touted this work as \\"album of the year\\", I commend the numerous Amazon reviewers that laid down the truth on this album's merit. I had never heard of Sufjan Stevens prior to reading the write-ups... in no less then five \\"Best of 2005\\" articles.<br /><br />Based on what I'd read I had prepared myself for the second coming of Beck! With phrases like \\"new standards for ambition\\", \\"Stevens' gift for crossing the grand with the intimate\\", \\"it's pop-art of the highest caliber\\" and finally  \\"...cements Stevens as one of the most vital voices in music today.\\"  If Stevens is one of today's most vital voices, then my worst fears for today's music have been validated. Come on music press, this is your freaking job! Is this the best you can do?<br /><br />Ultimately and unfortunately it took be about six listens before Illinoise started growing on me.  I rarely have time to give a CD two, let alone six chances before I make a decision, but being from Illinois and thinking I must be missing something the critics were hearing, I trudged through.<br /><br />There are a lot of influences I took away from this CD although Brian Wilson wasn't one of them.  What I did hear was Jimmie Spheeris, Simon & Garfunkel, The Polyphonic Spree, Violent Femmes, The Flaming Lips and Philip Glass/Steven Reich.  And is it me or does the trumpet in The Man of Metropolis sound reminiscent of the closing bars of the Tonight Show with Jay Leno?<br /><br />At the end of the day the CD is good, but not great. If your music shekels are limited, I'd suggest Extraordinary Machine by Fiona Apple, Amadou and Mariam's - Dimanche & Bamako or Employment by Kaiser Chiefs.<br /><br />Btw if you bought the Illinoise CD/Album with Superman it may be a collector's item.  Apparently there was a copyright issue with using the Man of Steel.
B000002HPT|4.0|Dream Theater came to fame by amazing their fans with their musicianship and well crafted songs highlighted by great vocals.  In every bands career they get to a point where they want to put out something different than the norm for various reasons.  Examples of this can come from many different genres such Kiss' album entitled \\"The Elder\\", The Dixie Chicks album entitled \\"Home\\", Garth Brooks album entitled \\"In the Life of Chris Gaines\\" and the list goes on.  In each example a very popular group/artist put out an album very different than their norm and it met a cold shoulder of their fans at the music store.  Unfortunately the same happened to Dream Theater with \\"Falling Into Infinity\\".<br /><br />\\"Falling Into Infinity\\" is a slower paced album than previous releases but still boasts the amazing musicianship that their fans have come to expect.  Some call it a sell out for the reason (I think anyway...) that all of their songs are radio friendly in tempo and length.  Were they trying to get more radio play?  Only they know for sure.  What I do know for sure is that this album is solid from start to finish.<br /><br />The only negative about this album to me is that none of the songs jumps at me and makes me take notice.  In other words, when I think of \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" I immediately think 'the slower album' vs. \\"Pull Me Under\\" when \\"Images and Words\\" is mentioned.  I think this is a great album to be enjoyed but maybe not in the same way or at the same time as the others.  Case in point, I personally like to listen to upbeat music when cleaning.  This is not an album that I'd put in the CD player when cleaning but I would on the other hand listen to it when doing something more mellow where as I wouldn't put in any of their other cd's when doing something more mellow.
0739313126|4.0|The writing itself wouldn't neccessarily wow me, but the plot and thought-stimulating presentation of logical and symbolic puzzles had me absolutely addicted. I hadn't heard anything about it before reading it, so if you're likely to judge something in comparison to its hype-factor it may skew things. I do however recommend it for people that are open minded critical thinkers that enjoy logic, puzzles, and the blending of ideas from what are usually well bordered disciplines such as philosophy, religion, and science/math.  It does this while slowly unraveling a mystery heavily involving historical religion and symbology as well as the storyline of  modern day characters involved in intrigue and adventure.  If this appeals to you or if you love good fictional conspiracy theory mysteries (like watching X-Files or Lost, for you TV viewers out there) then I highly recommend the book.<br /><br />If you can't suspend your disbelief, take fiction as just fiction, or are offended by any type of fictional ideas that may at all conflict with/question your own religious and historical beliefs, stay away. For those more concerned with critical analysis of writing style over the details of what you conjure up in your head while reading, your mileage may vary.<br /><br />I've put the hard-cover and the audio CD versions through their paces.  The only qualm I had was the audio reader's voice.  I felt his voice was too high across the range of characters and that the differentiation in voices was far too drastic.  He also over-annunciated certain things, especially the French terms and names.  Overall it almost felt like being a little kid and having a children's book read to you by a eunuch.  Okay, that's an exaggeration, but the voice does take some getting used to.
B000002HK4|5.0|After a band has been around a while and/or proved themselves many will issue an EP of a couple songs to tide fans over until the next album.  Generally these EP albums are but 20 minutes or so in length.  Dream Theater, however is not your generalized band.  Check out these track lengths:<br /><br />1.  A Change of Seasons - 23:09<br /><br />2.  Funeral For A Friend - 10:49<br /><br />3.  Perfect Strangers - 5:33<br /><br />4.  The Rover - 7:29<br /><br />5.  The Big Medley - 10:34<br /><br />With this EP you may get an EP sized track listing (5 songs) but you don't get the EP sized album length.<br /><br />As far as the songs go, be prepared to be blown away not only by the musicianship but also by the vocals.  'A Change of Seasons' is a sometimes melodic, sometimes hard rock song that is masterfully blended together to give the listener a range of emotions.<br /><br />The rest of the album is played live at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London, England on January 31, 1995.  Funeral For A Friend is a great song where the vocals are incredible.  It's been said by at least one reviewer that the vocals are furnished not by James LaBrie but Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden.  This is simply not correct.  James LaBrie provides all the vocals for the entire album.<br /><br />Track #4 is entitled 'The Rover' but it's actually a little incorrect.  On track #4 Dream Theater pays homage to Led Zeppelin by covering 'The Rover', 'Achilles Last Stand' and 'The Song Remains The Same'.<br /><br />The final track entitled 'The Big Medley' is a medley of the band's favorite songs that they grew up with and features: 'In The Flesh?' by Pink Floyd, 'Carry On Wayward Son' by Kansas, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by Queen, 'Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin' by Journey, 'Cruise Control' by Bruce Hornsby and 'Turn It On Again' by Genesis.<br /><br />Overall this cd is worth it for the wonderful title song as well as the great memories from great songs of the past few years.
B000002UAR|5.0|This album came out in 1966, not long before the Beatles would cease giving live performances and focus the remainder of their career on studio work.  This and \\"Rubber Soul\\" (which George Harrison would later correctly point out could be \\"Volume 1,\\" making \\"Revolver\\" Volume 2) are the band's two most solid efforts, with \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" following not too far behind. <br /> <br />A good number of my favorite Beatles songs come from this album.  \\"For No One,\\" \\"I Want to Tell You,\\" \\"Good Day Sunshine,\\" \\"Elanor Rigby,\\" \\"Taxman\\" and \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" are easily the best tracks on here.  This album represents the height of the Beatles' creative genius, a time when they began to grow out of the simple, repetitive songs and began to experiment.  Possibly the best example of this is the final cut, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" <br /> <br />If you are new to the Beatles, get \\"1\\" before diving into their full catalogue.  But if you are already a big fan, this album is a must.
B000CBSHK2|5.0|last night after work i listened to this album for the second time. I put it on and turned the volume down low so the neighbors wouldn't be disturbed. The volume didn't affect the quality of the music because it was made to be listened to that way. Beth's 1999 album \\"Central Reservation\\" also had a quiet rush about it but the disarming humility of \\"Comfort of Strangers\\" is unique. The music is straightforward without being bland witch adds up to perfect vehicles for Beth Orton songs. As I drifted between to tired to sleep and the actual thing the songs did their job of soaking in and keeping me just alert enough to enjoy them while not keeping me from resting. The songs have a lot to give and if you take them in and slowly taste them you'll experience their true richness and depth.<br /><br />this album contains enough of her best stuff to make this essential in her body of work. Beth is truly good at she does and she makes it seem so easy here.

0451167716|2.0|I read the reviews set forth here and wonder, what would the overall slant be if this book had not been made into one of the greatest movies ever made? Certainly, the reviews would not be as favorable and, most certainly, there would not be as many reviews. Everyone wanted to read the book after they saw the movie, and did. The movie is what it is, incredible, and the book is what it is, so-so. <br />This was the first adult book that I read as a child and I loved it. I read it again only a few years ago and still enjoyed it. Mr Puzo spins a wonderful tale. The family is wonderfully defined and presented. The story is a good story, not great. Because there are no good guys in this story, the reader cheers for the Corleone family, a very bad group, that goes about doing bad things to other bad guys with a moral code that only gangsters and murderers can understand. <br /> <br />The book loses direction in Las Vagas. What ever crossed the author's mind when writing this section I will never be able to fathom. It is boring, unsexy and too long. Might have three or three and half stars if this sidetrack was ommited. <br /> <br />That being said, I thank the book Gods for publishing this. For if this had not hit the book stands, we would never had the the sensation of viewing what I belive to be two of the greatest films over made: The Godfather and The Godfather Part II.  <br /> <br />So my hat is tipped in reverence to Mr. Puzo. Read the book, you will have fun with it. See the movies and you will be incredibly awed. <br /> <br />

B00005JO1Y|4.0|Peter Jackson's new version of `King Kong' is twice as long as the first version made in 1933. The basic story about the doomed beast and the beauty remains intact. Jackson infused more actions into the familiar story, but most impressive thing about this 3 hour 8 minute film is the tender and quite moments, in which King Kong and Ann Darrow are sitting side by side as if a scene from `The Beauty and the Beast.' <br /> <br />[BRILLIANT OPENING IN NEW YORK] We don't need to repeat this enormously popular tale here. Jackson wisely set the story in 1933, the same year when the original was released, and in the opening section Jackson sets up the film's period tone brilliantly with the scenes from New York City re-created by CGI. Here the central characters struggling stage actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts, perfect) and unscrupulous movie director Carl Denham (Jack Black) are given time to explain their background. The first chapter is perhaps better than the rest of the film as far as its dramatic power goes. I mean, of course, dramas among humans. <br /> <br />I said this because the special effects of Kong and the dinosaurs replacing the Willis H. O'Brien's still imaginative stop motion animations are at first stunning, but the extended chases and battles between humans and creatures (or creatures and creatures) get less and less exciting as the story unfolds. Actually, the story doesn't unfold much in the Skull Island where the ship's crew meets the Eighth Wonder of the World because Jackson gives one too many action here while we know how the battle ends before it starts. <br /> <br />[ALMOST PERFECT] The film is not boring, and I would have given perfect 5 stars if only Jackson hadn't done two necessary steps. One is the lengthy middle part as I said above, and the other is very unimaginative, clichd descriptions of the `natives' of the Skull Island. Jackson committed another typical mistake of making the islanders inexplicably hostile tribes while he doesn't needit. One of the merits of the Merian C. Cooper's direction in the original is that his descriptions of the tribesmen were stereotyped, but never negative ones. In this respect Jackson's `King Kong' looks like a throwback to the old Hollywood films Carl Denham himself might be shooting. <br /> <br />Ignore these flaws, and enjoy `King Kong' as a grand-scale entertainment.
B000BM6AVA|3.0|This album is not so great. there are a few songs which are great but the rest is not a good as their ather albums. i would reccamend you buy toxicity, it's a lot better all most all the songs are brilliant.
B0006U4UAU|4.0|This is a band that doesn't care what the \\"sound of the moment\\" is. They just make music. Period. This double CD is a treat for the senses for anyone that appreciates good music. Indie, punk, funk, disco... You name it, there's a splash of everything everywhere.  <br /> <br />The first CD is highly club-friendly, and whilst the bonus CD is less dancey, it is the beats that are substituted with bucket-loads of creative genius and strange but interesting melodies. What is always consistent on both CDs are the lyrics - when Murphy belts out 'It's a fat guy / In a T-shirt / Doing all the singing!' in \\"Movement\\", you know you're in for a treat! <br /> <br />Buy it and enjoy it!
B000C3H4MC|5.0|Its about time for this CD to be remastered.  The 2 channel audio CD sounds great.  The 5.1 channel version sounds great, especially with a great sound system.  I wouldn't say it sounds incredibly better than the remastered 2 channel version.  The 5.1 sounds different, but not so greatly different either.  Its nice to hear the percussion coming from the sattellite speakers for example, but it doesn't totally change the song either.  <br /> <br />This is a CD highly worth purchasing if you're a fine of the Talking Heads. <br />
0393324818|5.0|If you are at all interested in baseball you need to read this book. Michael Lewis does fantastic job of explaining the Billy Beane/Bill James theory of statistical analysis and contrasting it to the traditional ways of evaluating baseball talent and traditional game strategies. It is amazing how resistant Major League Baseball (and most of those around it) is to consider alternative ways of doing things. Not everyone will agree with the theories of Mr. Beane, Mr. James, etc., but anyone who enjoys watching baseball and isn't afraid to try looking at things in a non-traditional way should definitely read this book.
B000301YY8|5.0|I listened to a few songs by James Blunt last week and I immediately bought the album, he deserved that I buy his first. <br />His compositions might be simple at some times but they're all different and have something special in each of 'em. <br />If you love Rock Acoustic you will love this album. <br />And finally... some women might not like it... he's not a poser ahah! <br />This album have more than only 2 or 3 good songs, I didn't find one that I \\"dislike\\". <br />Get this album it is worth it, he worked hard on it since he came from nowhere, and HE did write his songs, and you can feel as you listen to it, very emotional at times, I haven't seen many new artists in 2005-06 doing that. <br />James Blunt have a great future in there.
0440241588|3.0|When Washington power broker Joel Backman gets a presidential pardon after serving six years of his twenty-year sentence in federal prison for compromising national security, he is given a new identity and sent to Italy. He undergoes an intensive language and culture training program to integrate him into Italian life and hide him from danger... at least that's what he's told. What he doesn't know is that he has been set up by the CIA as a target for assassination in order to determine which foreign agency he tried to sell secrets to.<br /><br />Joel Backman might be a former lawyer, but this is no legal thriller. There are no courtroom scenes, crime investigations, or legal maneuvers. It borders more on an espionage thriller, although the cloak-and-dagger action is minimal. The book consists mostly of Backman's struggles to keep a low profile in a foreign country and outfox his nameless pursuers. There is some amusing humor at the start of the book as the completely inept president, in his last hours in office, is bullied by the CIA into pardoning Backman. But that rapidly falls by the wayside as Backman goes into hiding. I found that the best part of the book was its delightful travel narrative, with Backman playing tourist and absorbing the local color of Treviso, Bologna, and other Italian cities. I imagined myself sitting with Backman in the cafes, drinking espresso and dining on fantastic local cuisine, learning Italian, and wandering the arched portico-covered sidewalks while absorbing the scenic panoramas of Bologna.<br /><br />Although the first half of the book was fairly suspenseful, the ending was very disappointing. It seems that Grisham grew weary of Backman's predicament and decided to tie up the loose ends far too tidily. He brought the story abruptly to an unrealistic and naive conclusion. This is not one of Grisham's best efforts, but if you enjoy travelogues and want to practice your Italian 101, you might consider that the book's redeeming quality.<br /><br />Thanks, Teressa :)quality.  <br /> <br />Thanks, Teressa :)

B000B5QWKG|4.0|The four stars I'm giving is for the music on the disc. But here's my warning about the DualDisc format of this album: even though the track listing here on Amazon.com suggests that the DVD side has the album in 5.1 surround sound, that is *not* true. If you read the label on the album, it says \\"enhanced stereo\\". <br />Getting a surround sound mix is the only reason I would ever buy a DualDisc and this one doesn't have it. The extra video content on the DVD side is not really worth the extra cost. Get the CD version of this album.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus is worth your time, assuming you've come this far. If you are new to this band and their music keep in mind there are earlier works that you'll want also. This one starts with a very good song, The Grudge (love that cornerstone, powerful, sturdy)...I'm not even going to try to crawl into someone elses head in order to decipher intention, though you might want to. But, I really think in order to get something out of anything, including music, you have to chance it, you must forego predisposition. Honestly, I think the writer has tried to convey this whilst the band makes music as well, it ties in very well. You don't need me to tell you about the sound, lest you have not heard it yet. And in that case, you are in for a nice ride...the bass is awesome (as usual), and of course this band sports the best damned drummer God ever gave six hands to, lol. Keep in mind to keep an open mind, let it run, let it grow inside, just pay the bills and keep your job, hold on, stay inside. \\"Parabol/Parabola\\" screws with me a little. I like the idea of eternity and all that stuff, the (what is it 27 virgins, 17?...heck I've never seen one here in Virginia) gist, I reckon, is lost on me...but I do pick up on an eastern theme. I thought about Parabol for some time, not more than a day people (give me some credit for having other things to do), then picked up my Webster...got nuthin, poo. So, went online and found this to allay my curiosity. Oh, I can't show you, but I can tell ya: It's a geometric proposition where a \\"round/cylindrical/orbital object IN MOTION contacts (in whatever fashion, for whatever imaginable reason/illusion)an impenetrable one-dimensionable flat entity. Look at it this way, a half arc coinciding with a vertical line, intersecting, no, bisecting there. The idea of Parabol, then is the measure, the continuance of what follows under collision to commence. It's like taking a ruler and stretching it out to find all points at any point on the approaching arc are at the exact distance from the vertical straight-edge at any given time. Maybe I'm mistaken, but I would like to know if I am, so please correct me...these kind of things are neat. Damn, got off the subject. Buy it, listen 'til you are tired of listening, then just hear it and it will give you something to bash your head against the wall to, or give you something to think about like not (for example) bashing in your head. On the subject, try Aenima, it is tremendous, different than this and just as good but different (like you and me) and you'll find my very favorite song, \\"H.\\" You should, you really should. Tracy (Hi Nick!)
B00000K3CM|5.0|This Home Alone is such a great big hit and more of these actions are funny. Perhaps parents should see this movie before they let their kids watch, some of the action like Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) throwing bricks at Marv (Daniel Stern) does not seem to be the best scene for young children. But on top of that, this is funny and interesting.
B000CS45QU|4.0|I was able to rip/import/download/whatever both discs without incident under OS X. Transferred to and plays on my iPod, as well.
0060512806|5.0|Cryptonomicon is one of the best books I've read in the past several years. It has three very interesting and captivating storylines, tying not only the characters together but also the history, technology and business of the past several decades. Stephenson blends entertainment with education into a novel which has kept me intrigued weeks after finishing the book. <br /> <br />If you are drawn to this novel because of Stephenson's classification as a Science Fiction author, it should be noted that Cryptonomicon doesn't contain a lot of science fiction. However, Stephenson is the perfect voice for this type of novel - he has the background and understanding behind the mathematics and technology that helped the Allies break the Axis's codes during World War II, and his attention to detail and wry sense of humor give his characters depth and personality. <br /> <br />All in all, this is edutainment at its finest! I'm looking forward to Stephenson's \\"Baroque Cycle,\\" which has characters related to those in Cryptonomicon.
B00008G9JM|5.0|Being the second album long song created by Jethro Tull, you may expect the kind of wonders found on \\"Thick as a Brick\\".  But this album seems more melancholy than the first effort by Jethro Tull.  The inserted fairy-tale is a nice break, but belongs somewhere other than the beginning of track 2.  It should have been set into its own track but arguing that is pointless.  The song is quite the piece, but I wouldn't recommend it for new-comers to Jethro Tull.  I would recommend listening to \\"Thick as a Brick\\", \\"Songs from the Wood\\", or \\"Aqualung\\" before venturing into \\"A Passion Play\\".  Nonetheless, you will find that it's an enjoyable song to listen to and I recommend it for Jethro Tull fans.
B0000025RI|5.0|I first brought this album in 2001, at that time michael jackson was my faviourite recording artist, over the latter years there has been an insight in michael jacksons like and a lot of aquisisitions were MADE up. maybe not all were fake but this is not a review on his life and what he does but to his greatest triumph, Thriller. <br />i stopped listning to this album around last year because it was considered uncool to listen to him cause he was so called \\"kiddy feeler\\" and not listning to it ment i just went off his music.  i started listning to the album again last month and it doesnt matter how long u havent heard the album 4 the moment u listen to it again u are drawn back to it i dont know another album that can do that to a person. <br />michael left his disco theme for his previous albums such as off the wall to make a new sound, a sound that would make him the first black artist to appear on MTV , many ppl can recall the first time they heard the song and video 4 thriller and many consider this 1 of the gr8est songs ever but to hear other great songz to this standard u just have to listen to the whole album. This album easily grabbed 8 grammys, songs like thriller, billie jean, beat it, baby be mine, human nature, p.y.t  cannot be replicated these should easily be in the top 100 songs ever, the somgs are feel good and this is the album that would put make him the King Of Pop. <br />there are many haters that hate the preset music from jacko and believe his music is wack   but if jacko aint the king of pop    who is?     no1 has made such a mark on music as jacko did    prove me wrong
B000002J09|5.0|It's not one of my favorite Led Zeppelin albums.  Aside from \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" which everyone seems to either really like or really hate, the album lacks the flair found on the first two Led Zeppelin albums.  I would recommend listening to Led Zeppelin I & II before (Zoso), but Stairway seems to be the big selling point of this album.  True Zeppelin fans will find enjoyment with this album, but many others are sceptic on the quality of the album and how much its songs are over-played on the radio.
0393327655|5.0|It was very clear where Sam Harris was going with his arguments. His arguments for self-reliance and rational introspection hold up well. While he points an indicting finger at two of the three monotheistic western philosophies I think the 9/11 experience caused him to focus too much on the perils of Islamic faith.  He certainly does not neglect the fundamentalist Christian as he does Judaism, which can easily be understood because of the relatively but arogantly non-proselytizing nature of the later. <br />In this sense and only in this sense his impeachment of faith as an external motivator is somewhat unbalanced.  This imbalance is somewhat distracting but does't destroy his thesis. <br /> <br />The need for something like faith as a justification for existence and somewhat of a buffer against the fear of the unknown seems to be the bane of mankind, a necessary balm for the mind that doesn't want to or can't explore alternatives.  Sam Harris provides the replacement.  However, unlike the majority of the other reviewers I do not place this solution in the camp of atheism.  One can be an spiritualist while being an atheist but being a spiritualist does not make one an atheist.  If the forces attributed to any diety, as opposed to the idea of a diety, are captured within the mind and being of an individual the awareness of the ultimate reality i.e. mysticism is not only achievable but desireable.
B00026WU64|5.0|By the time I was born, Bob Dylan had already been around for 16 years.  And yet I find this album to be a masterpiece that will with-stand the test of time.  Bob Dylan's style of folk rock may have withered with the times, but the message and the feeling has not.  Bob Dylan is one of the greatest lyricists I have ever heard.  His songs have meaning, tell stories, prove a point, or are just plain wonderful to listen to.  I highly recommend this for any Bob Dylan or folk rock fan or anyone that wants something to listen to.
B0000630BT|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best album that Judas Priest ever put out. This album is full of amazing guitar work from one of the most underrated guitarists in the genre: Tipton and Downing. No talk about the drum work, incredible, with great double-bass. Rob Halford makes a great improvement here, with high screamings in \\"Night Crawler\\", my favorite in the album. Recommended!!!
B000001FAK|5.0|Unlike the other reviewer who was there, the show I attended  <br />(Saturday late) was absolutely sold out.The innovative sound mix- minus drums and, for the most part, <br />heavy electric guitars- became very natural after a very short while. The highlight of the CD, and of the show, was the magnificent sax work of Johnny Almond- especially on the odd timed (6/4) \\"California\\" and \\"...Roxanne\\". His flute playing is a little above average (see Ian Anderson of Tull for way above average) but the sax work is very strong and melodic as are Steve Thompson on Bass and Jon Mark on finger guitar. <br />A great listen, even 36 years later.
B000BO0LLS|3.0|There are a few Mariah tracks that sort of take you back to the Mariah Carey most fans grew up with, however, the album felt kinda forced and sung in a fashion for the sake of Mariah singing high notes.  Her label has been picking all the wrong songs to be singles.  They should have picked Stay The Night, Say Something and even the track featuring Nelly, although Nelly is becoming a parody of himself.  She could have done better with her emancipation without the help of Jermaine Dupri.  The 3 and-a-half stars stem from loving those three joints that I mentioned but it truly ends there.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Not only is this one of the best western movies ever made, it could be one of the greatest movies period. Clint Eastwood, Van Lee Cleef, and Eli Wallach(a scene stealer) have an onscreen chemistry that has yet to be matched. All three give terrific performances as dirty, nasty, and downright mean individuals whose soul purpose is driven by greed and a deep sense of individualism. I truly believe that the last 20 min. of the movie are the greatest ever shot. The scene were Tuco is running through the cemetary he has spent nearly the entire movie looking for gave me chills. No other movie I have seen has done that to me. But a truly great, one-of-a-kind movie cannot be driven by groundbreaking scenes and amazing actors alone. That is were Ennio Morricone comes in. Without his justifiably famous score, I do not think this movie would be half as good. If you like the movie, I strongly reccomend buying the soundtrack. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that a few of the voice-overs were done quite poorly. A small price to pay to watch cinematic history unfold before your eyes.
B000268QB2|5.0|I never thought I would say this, but finally I've heard a band whose vocalist (Tom Chaplin) compares to Freddie Mercury.  His voice is freaking amazing.  Even if Keane doesn't last very long, I think he is in for a great career. <br /> <br />Besides that, the music is awesome.  The lyrics are great.  Can't wait for the next album.
B00004U8JV|4.0|JURASSIC PARK: THE LOST WORLD isn't quite as bad as a lot of reviewers say, although they certainly are entitled to their opinions---isn't that what this site's all about?<br /><br />At any rate, while the sequel loses some of its originality and awe-inspiring moments, it does well as an action film, with the T rexs attacking the trailer a nail-biting sequence.  There's a lot of predictability in the scientists vs. the hunters formula, but in a film like this, one can accept predictablility if it's handled professionally.  And the effects and camera work are par excellence.  As in the first film, Jeff Goldblum underplays his role, perhaps a bit too much this time---he almost seems bored?  Julianne Moore who was to go on to more \\"acting\\" roles is okay as the heroine, a little more exciting than Laura Dern.  I too agree with the decision to go politically correct and give Goldblum an African-American daughter, especially since there's no background to add to this relationship.  Pete Postelthwaite and Arliss Howard as the villains were appropriately cast.  While not as big a hit as its prequel, LOST WORLD entertained me.
0767834739|4.0|In 2002, audiences and critics alike were surprised by the success of the video game inspired hit \\"Resident Evil\\".  Though critics and even some moviegoers didn't feel the movie was worthy of receiving a sequel, even though the ending was left wide open and a sequel was needed for some sort of resolution to the story, the studio execs were clearly listening to those that enjoyed the movie and decided to buck the critics and released \\"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse\\".  The same people that despised the first film were bashing the release of its sequel with just as much passion; however, upon it's release the film managed to silence many of its attackers.  Not settling for merely making a sequel for money alone, writer Paul W. S. Anderson (the writer/director of \\"Resident Evil\\") crafted an even bigger, better, and more action packed thriller for the follow-up, and succinctly silenced the nay-sayers with a sequel that ties up all loose ends from the original film, serving as an excellent addition to a budding franchise. <br /> <br />\\"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse\\" begins directly where \\"Resident Evil\\" left off, starting with a flashback sequence that serves as a refresher course for the audience so that all are on the same page when the action really gets going.  Surviving the zombie attacks in the underground compound of the Umbrella Corporation, Alice (Milla Jovovich) arrives in Raccoon City, located right next to the compound, and discovers that she is too late.  The entire city has apparently been overrun by zombies, with most of the city in ruins, Alice begins searching for any non-infected survivors.  She finds a few companions that are willing to take the fight to the zombies, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), well-armed and ready for action these compatriots set out to rid Raccoon City of the evil unleashed by Umbrella Corporation.  However, Umbrella Corp. has a surprise for our heroes, a nasty mutated form of zombie known as Nemesis.  With supplies becoming drastically limited, it appears that time is running out for our heroes, and humanity's days could be numbered. <br /> <br />As I stated earlier, \\"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse\\" is simply a better film than its predeccesor, in terms of acting, storytelling, pacing, and action.  To be fair, \\"Resident Evil\\" is merely the opening chapter to this much bigger story that is told in \\"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse\\", and in truth, neither of the two films hold up on their own.  Director Alexander Witt brings his valuable experience as a much respected 2nd Unit Director from his previous film experiences, \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"The Bourne Identity\\" to name a couple, giving the material a more mature, polished appearance that the original film lacked.  The special effects, including the practical and make-up effects, are all improved in \\"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse\\".  A very good decision was made in having the Nemesis monster not be just another CGI character, but be a physical man in a suit, it is with the Nemesis character that the make-up and practical effects team really shined.  The acting and storytelling were much improved from the original film, and the addition of Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera from the video games was an especially nice touch. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse\\" is a very solid, zombie thriller that doesn't stand up well on it's own, but when coupled with the first film, the two make for a very entertaining thrill ride of zombie mayhem. <br /> <br />\\"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse\\" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity.
0312330529|3.0|Fascinating book. His story is amazing and unbelievable.  I loved the plot.  The writing was tedious at times with cumbersome prose getting in the way and clunky dialogue and tired cliches distracting from the writing.  Some of the emotional scenes were maudlin.  The action was fantastic and the fast paced pulse of Bombay well captured.  The sensuality of the novel was overpowering.  I can't wait to see it as a major motion picture.
B00070Q7VO|2.0|His voice is sweet and sultry but the words that he's singing aren't meaningful at all. The sound and production are there but it seems they've taken a young man with a great voice and he has no real emotion to express. If listening to bellows of nothingness coming through the speakers is your idea of a good time then by all means get this album. If not, look for someone who actually has something to say.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|Three stars is kind of an average.  Some aspects of the 1984 versions of \\"Dune\\" barely rate two stars, other aspects get four.<br /><br />In relation to the book:  OK, this is barely two stars.  The cinematic release and the extended/mutilated for television versions of the 1984 movie have only a nodding aquaintence with the (insert your personal favorite superlatives) book by Frank Herbert.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book, but I am a fan not a fanatic.  I won't rehash the numerous issues that more devoted fans will bring up, but if your expecting a faithful rendition you'll be disappointed.  On the other hand, the extended version incorporated a lot of the missing background material that kept the basic version form making sense.  Also, the movie captured (I feel) the flavor that Frank Herbert was trying to capture in the key characters; the brooding power of Jose Ferrer's portrayal of the emperor, the sterness and loyalty of Gurney Halleck as played by Patrick Stewart, Princess Irulan's haughtiness, etc.  The character of the culture of the world of Dune was well represented; highly structured, repressed, based on appearences and duplicity.<br /><br />Cinematic release vs. the extended version:  The extended version was made for TV, as a not quite miniseries.  Between the two of them, they could have made a pretty good movie, with the extended version filling in the conceptual and storyline gaps that are glossed over by the cinematic release, and the original version providing more action and drama (and less repetition of filler footage) than the TV/extended version.  This was most noticable in the scene were Baron Harkonnen kills a slave just for kicks; this scene was mutilated beyond comprehension in the extended version.  The extended version also disrupted the score, which seriously detracted from the impact.  Frankly, this felt like a slightly sleazy marketing gambit to maximize profit from the title.  If they had wanted to make a good movie, they could have inserted all the footage from the theater version that didn't make it to the TV version, and cut the repetitive footage and had a much better product.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the movies, not loved them.  The sets were impressive and conveyed a sense of established but alien style.  The costumes were magnificent, and developed the presentation very well.  Casting was spotty, but where it was on, it was really on (for example, Max von Sydow was a great Liet, but for all her talent and charm, Sean Young simply was not as fitting a Chani as Barbora Kodetova, Richard Jordan was a great Duncan Idaho, Brad Dourif completly missed the oily aspect of Piter DeVries, etc).  The portrayal of Baron Harkonnen and his clan was both very good (conveying the impression of evil and vindictiveness) and a little too much (almost like an oversized child in the midst of a perpetual temper tantrum).  The story moved well in the theatrical release, but was somewhat choppy and alternately rushed and repetative in the extended version.<br /><br />In all, good not great, and should be considered in isolation from the book.  The SciFi channel's version really was better by any criteria.  It is pretty sad when the best comments about a DVD go to the nifty metal case...could have inserted all the footage from the theater version that didn't make it to the TV version, and cut the repetitive footage and had a much better product. <br /> <br />Overall, I liked the movies, not loved them.

B0000028M7|5.0|ive listened to pretty much every grunge album out there and this is one of the best. alice in chains are kinda like a more evil nirvana minus the pop hooks plus a strong dose of metal. the lyrics are semi-disturbing, so little kids out there dont come running over to amazon crying, youve been warned. <br /> <br />this album is definitely their best. every song is incredibly unique and the songs do not run together at all like so many other albums do. <br /> <br />my favorite songs: sickman, them bones, dam that river, would (though all rock in their own way)
B000AP04FG|3.0|I especially liked the Butch & Sundance & War of the Roses bits. This is a star driven flick. Unbeknownst to each other  they are rival paid assassins. They have been married for five (or six) years. When they find out & are going after the same target, you know what will happen next. An action movie with lots of laughs. The only thing serious is the amount of $$$ they made to do this. The chemistry between Brad Pitt & Angela Jolie is genuine since they were getting to know each other real well off screen. What a deal. It's not art, it's a flick. Enjoy  <br />
B00009YXAD|5.0|To discover this album was a truly amazing experience. I like the sound of this album, every instrument has it's place and every song has must space left to be filled in by your imagination. Also I like Neil using the complete register of his voice (not so much of the high tones, like \\"After the goldrush\\"). The lyrics.....everything is just right and you never seem to catch the full mystery of this album. All reasons to listen to it again and again.
0440238609|2.0|I was expecting to be blown away, what with all the great reviews. Sadly so, I was very disappointed. Well, not at first. The first book was okay. I would have rated it about 4 stars, had it not been for the second book, which then I would've rated 3 stars. And then the third book, well, it was such an effort to read. Add to that the blasphemous theme regarding the Authority (God). (If you believe in God like I do, this book could be offensive.) Moreover, the writing was not spontaneous, it felt contrived. The plot was often predictable. The characters, too, lacked substance. They were not very likeable nor at all convincing, not even Lyra, the main character, to me. Probably the only character I took to would be Iorek Byrnison, the armored bear king.    I do agree with one reviewer who said that once you get into the first book, you probably should finish the rest, if only to find out what the ending is. And if you haven't read it at all but you're curious about the hype, you should probably read this trilogy, too, just to figure out what it's about. It's not that bad, really, it's just not that good either. (Well, the ending was pretty bad.) I just didn't enjoy this as much as I did Eragon and Eldest.
B000BYRCRY|5.0|This is a great movie that inspired a new perception about the world of Vampires and Lycans. This 2-Disc Unrated Extended Edition also comes with a booklet that gives you a glimpse into the comic work of the Underworld. The movie was re-cutted with more details added and time sequence rearranged. It is difficult to say whether the original theater release was better or not...<br /><br />A Vampire fan must have!
1573223026|3.0|I was expecting to enjoy this book, as the premise was very interesting, four individuals incidentally meet on a building rooftop on New Year's Eve, all with the intentions of jumping off. What happens is, instead of killing themselves, they actually form a sort of friendship. Well, could be good. But I was very disappointed. I did not take towards any one character at all. Their thoughtful meanderings were too thoughtful, too self-conscious to ever be spontaneous. The characters were just so unnatural to the point that they oftentimes annoyed me. Of course, as expected with Hornby, there were funny moments at best. But this didn't do for me what High Fidelity did.
B000777J2S|2.0|I guess what really kept me from ever truly enjoying this albums was the lead singer's positively bizarre voice. I really couldn't take the lyrics seriously either. Maybe it's one of those love it or hate it type of things, but in all honesty I couldn't move past the vocals or cheesy, bland lyrics.
B00000J6AG|4.0|Like many, the first time I've heard Moby's music was when they used his songs in commercials. And when I got this album, I was hooked. This is fine ambient techno right here. Get it for the songs \\"Find my Baby\\" \\"Why does my heart feel so bad?\\" \\"Natural Blues\\" \\"Everloving\\" and \\"My Weakness\\" these are, to me, the best songs in Play.
0440241588|3.0|What has made this book popular is its touch of Italy and the anxiety build up as secrets unfold.  The last couple of chapters are very simple and everyone I know who read the book has felt disappointed by them.  I can't help but wonder if Mr. Grisham didn't run out of time and slapped something together to meet a printing date, what a shame!  If you read the first chapter you will be hooked.  Enjoy the ride, but don't expect a great ending.  If you have been to Italy, or have ever thought of going (and love mysteries) you will enjoy the book.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|With fine vocals, impressive orchestration, a fabulous solo violinist, and an outstanding feel of Celtic music, what more could you ask for?<br /><br />Grade: A
0316286850|5.0|I recently picked up a charming, wonderfully well written makeup book called Making Faces. The  book is extremely well laid out with both the looks and exactly how this artist created them. <br /> <br />The instructions are simple and easy to understand. <br /> <br />Most of all I like his philosophy on beauty. He believes that there is no one set of beauty rules, just as there is no \\"right\\"way to look or apply makeup. He believes in experimenting and finding your own beauty. His guidelines are simply a starting point while you discover a look that fits you. <br /> <br />I highly recommend that you read this and pass it on to anyone you know who needs to feel beautiful, confident and sexy.
B0002YLC24|1.0|interesting conversation but.... <br />my question is that there is another sequal after 9 years ? <br />or what?.. whats the point? no ending? i mean after i watched this movie , im like what? thats it? what happened? such waste my time... i like before sunrise is way much better... <br />maybe this is art,  i guess.
0307276902|4.0|Having read both Million Little Pieces and My Friend Leonard, I have to say that I am more surprised at how many people are so shocked that he embellished many details in his book.  As much as I enjoyed reading both books, it was clear to me that much of his bravado was just that...bravado.  Root canals with no anesthetic...ha.  Loaded unconscious and bleeding onto a plane...yeah, right.  Aside from it being over the top (the not-so-true parts), I was totally immersed in reading this book from beginning to end.  Was I insulted that he tried to pass this off as all being true?  Not for a minute.  I saw through it.
B0001DI0FI|2.0|Okay, now, in all fairness to this movie, I didn't watch the entire thing. I couldn't. I sat through the first four hours, and it was slow and tedious. I didn't care about any of the characters, and there was no action or plot whatsoever. Five or six hours in, a pseudo-interesting thing happened. That kept me watching for a while longer. But hour ten, I gave up. I realized nothing exciting was ever going to happen; and I'd grown to loathe all of the characters. I'd also grown a beard. It was looong.     -Steve   [...]     And don't say that this review wasn't helpful.  I dared to say what no one else would: that this movie is long.
6304907648|5.0|Because of my complete obsession with learning about serial killers, Copycat has always been a favorite thriller of mine. An outstanding cast delivers the goods. Hunter & Weaver are fabulous in this, so to anyone that's a fan of either actress, you can't miss with this. The premise is simple...there's a serial killer in town who keeps changing his M.O. (that's method of operation for anyone not familiar with the term) is discovered to be copying the infamous crimes of serial killers before him. Anyone who enjoys learning about serial killers will no doubt enjoy this thriller as it talks about some of the most famous killers we've ever seen. It's a fast-paced thriller that you'll enjoy even when you can see things coming. I highly recommend it!
0553801503|2.0|I have one short comment.  I hope Mr. Martin never uses the phrase, \\"half a hundred\\" again.  Why he used it so often in this book is beyond me, but I'm afraid it represents a certain laziness on the part of both author and editor.  This is not a petty concern; it represents a summary of other sloppy writing practices evident in the book.  With such an interesting plot and characters, the writing should not be lazy. <br />With respect,
0739302752|3.0|Overall, I liked the audiobook. It emphasizes several useful concepts: the value of evaluating performance, how to evaluate it, how to deal with non-performers, recognizing the doers, and so on. Listening to Bossidy is like having a coaching session. <br /> <br />The main flaw of the book was the choice of Dick Brown of EDS as an example of somebody who knows how to execute. He was removed from the CEO position in 2003 after it was discovered he had made some megadeals that cost EDS millions of dollars. When it was made public, it produced exactly what the authors describe as the result of poor execution: stock value that falls immediately, investor loss of trust, and low morale for the employees. <br /> <br />The authors should have provided more examples. In the end, they provided three examples of troubled companies, and not a single success case. The principles are useful, though, even without a good case. That's the reason the book gets three stars.
0062502182|5.0|I read this book after recieving many recommendations to read it. I was not dissapointed as it is probably one of the most insightful books I have read in the last 5 years. The book takes the reader on the journey of a boy who is chasing his dream to find gold in Egypt. Along the way the boy experiences many obstacles and triumphs on the way to realizing his dream. I learned so much about the importance of the journey and the fact that we should be chasing our dreams. This book inspired me more than any fiction book I can think of.
0711954291|5.0|This is the best beginners book. I have tried different methods with my students, so far this one works best as for introducing notes on the staff from bass clef F to treble G.  This book introduces note at the staff one at a time and works on both clefs from the beginning. It starts with middle C in treble clef and bass clef in whole, half, and quarter notes. Then students learn D and B, and time signature 4/4, 3/4, 2/4. Then it introduces E (treble), A (bass), F (treble), G (bass), G (treble) and F (bass). Includes read aloud and writing exercises. If the students do these exercises they will have good reading skill. Highly recommended.
0385504209|4.0|I will admit I read this book 2 years ago and have never reviewed it until now. I don't like suspense, never have. I've found it way too gory and drawn out. I read the DaVinci Code because of the tie-in to Da Vinci. It was good. It had me getting out of bed at 1am to get my copy of Da Vinci's works from downstairs so I could visualize the description of the \\"Last Supper\\". Trying to decipher the code along with the lead characters is what kept me going much like following along with \\"National Treasure\\" and \\"Artemis Fowl\\".<br />If you like chair clenching suspense this maybe boiring for you. But If your new to the genre you might like it. Here are certain things to keep in mind;<br />1) This the second in a series. Angels and Demons is first. Read Angels and Demons and you'll understand the lead character better.<br />2) This book has been on the NY Times bestseller list for over 147 weeks. Don't read it because of the hype only. If you don't like the subject don't read it. You'll be disappointed.<br />3) It's a work of fiction! If you are so set in your beliefs that you can't enjoy a work of fiction. You may not want to read this book.<br />Give it a try, I enjoyed it and I don't like people bleeding to death.
B00005UOXL|5.0|In 1981, after making a name for himself fronting the British punk band Generation X, Billy Idol relocated to New York City to make it on his own. While Generation X never broke though the mainstream to achieve massive success, and while the band was generally snubbed by many punk purists as being overtly commercial, Billy Idol was born to be a star. His charisma, photogenic good looks, and ultra-cocky persona were destined to make him an icon in the flashy, glitzy 80s. After three albums with Generation X, \\"Generation X,\\" (1978) \\"Valley of the Dolls,\\" (1979) and \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\" (1981) Idol unleashed his solo debut, the self-titled \\"Billy Idol\\" (1982).<br /><br />For his new band, Idol hooked up with guitar virtuoso Steve Stevens, bassist Phil Feit, and drummer Steve Missal. While the album title says \\"Billy Idol,\\" it should be emphasized that the greatness of Idol's early solo works rests on the fact that Idol had a killer, killer guitar player with Stevens and an excellent producer and collaborator with Keith Forsey.<br /><br />There are a lot of Shredders and guitar virtuosos out there, but Stevens is one of the best and certainly most underrated. His playing is flashy, but also has soul, and is always fully captivating. The Idol/Stevens/Forsey combo produced some of the best, most memorable singles of the decade.<br /><br />While Idol's sophomore classic \\"Rebel Yell\\" (1983) is his best album, the self-titled debut is almost as good. \\"Billy Idol\\" possesses the same radio-friendly pop-punk elements as Generation X, but Idol's solo debut is a far superior offering. For one thing, the songs are better written, with tighter, catchier hooks and unbelievable guitar work. \\"Billy Idol,\\" with its ferocious riffs, strong melodies, cool synths, and stellar guitar work is equal parts punk, pop, and hard-rock. \\"Billy Idol\\" is probably Idol's most organic album, as the synths aren't a focal point and the album is generally more of a meat-and-potatoes affair compared to the more ambitious follow-ups.<br /><br />While \\"Billy Idol\\" is generally given good reviews, it's still an underrated album. A common claim by both fans and critics is that the album has a few strong singles and a lot of filler. I would strongly refute this claim. While some songs are better than others, the entire album is quite strong. A lot of Idol's most memorable work can be found on this release.<br /><br />\\"Billy Idol\\" opens up strong with the hard-rocking \\"Come On, Come On.\\" Idol's sneering; cocky delivery over the brutal assault of Steve Stevens makes this one of the album's strongest tracks. The MTV staple and 80s classic \\"White Wedding\\" follows next. Its eerie background sighs, tension filled verse, and contrasting dark imagery and pop-sensibility make \\"White Wedding\\" a triumph. The album takes a left turn with the popish, stylish, seductive ode to New York City with \\"Hot in the City.\\" \\"Dead on Arrival\\" is a good-but-not-great middle of the road rocker. \\"Nobodies Business\\" is perhaps Idol's most underrated song. Its infectious sing-along harmonies, light-as-a-feather but strong melodies and crunching solos make it pure ear-candy. The off-beat \\"Love Calling\\" is another strong, underrated song. With its jungle beats, what sounds like Asian back-up singers, and horns, \\"Love Calling\\" comes out of left field, but it works. While its lyrics are completely nonsensical (\\"if you wanna rub-a-dub-dub-dub') and Idol's overtly sexual overtones are beyond dated and cheesy, it only adds to its charm. \\"Hole in the Wall\\" is a solid, memorable, somewhat dark atmospheric rocker. \\"Shooting Stars,\\" a tale of innocence lost to drugs and indulgence, is both sympathetic and cautionary. The album's most relaxed, calmest moment comes with \\"It's so Cruel,\\" a song of longing that also manages to be cocky (leave it to Idol). \\"Billy Idol\\" closes with the Generation X staple, the up-beat, catchy ode to masturbation \\"Dancing with myself.\\"<br /><br />If cool is defined as timeless, and hip astrendy, \\"Billy Idol,\\" much like Miami Vice, is equal parts cool and hip. This album is dated, very dated, and while Idol's persona is cheesy and Idol is a relic of a bygone era, he's still cool as sh.t. Dated as it may be \\"Billy Idol\\" is very well-written, with killer hooks and grooves, and outstanding guitar work. If you are a fan of punk, new-wave, hard-rock, pop, or anything 80s, this album is sure to please.imeless, and hip as trendy, \\"Billy Idol,\\" much like Miami Vice, is equal parts cool and hip.

B000002KOQ|5.0|By the time the Seventies rolled in, Joni Mitchell had two albums to her name and was one of the biggest rising names in folk-pop music in America. The release of her third album, \\"Ladies Of The Canyon,\\" would further establish her and raise her profile amongst the public and critics alike. She took even more control over the music and writing (almost all) on this album, which is seen by many to her the transitional album between her earlier folk music sound and the more poignant, jazz-influenced epics that would follow later in the decade. Every song on this album is either great or excellent. Joni wistfully plays her piano in almost every song on the album, and the vocals are stunning and varied in pitch. Her legendary distinct vocal delivery is evident in every song here.<br /><br />The album opens with the beautiful \\"Morning Morgantown.\\" This is a wistful, and happy, upbeat song. It's quite mid-tempo and one of Joni's first-recorded songs, dating back to 1967! It appeared three years down the line on this album, and it sounds as fresh today as it no doubt did almost 40 years ago. The chorus is very melodic and airy, Joni's vocals sunlit with sweet affection. \\"For Free\\" is arguably the most beautiful song on the album. I wasn't too fond of it to begin with, but there's just something about that stunning piano that catches my soul every time I hear it. Joni's vocals are gorgeous, especially when she sings, \\"And I play if you have the money...\\" It's a song about an artist (Joni) who is a singer, who performs in bars, making her money - yet she sees a man on the streets playing for free. He wants nothing but to play for the sheer joy of playing his songs. The last thirty seconds are so intense as a clarinet solo plays out, emphasising the isolation of this song. \\"Conversation\\" is a brilliant up-tempo number, very fast-paced and probably the most positive song on the album. The lyrics are brilliant and quite psychedelic. I love the pianos, the guitars and everything about this song. The last minute is brilliant where Joni and backing singers pipe \\"Doo, doo doo!\\" over and over to a trumpet. \\"Ladies Of The Canyon,\\" the title track, is another stunning song. This is a more folksy guitar-driven song. Joni's vocal delivery is bright, very high-pitched and expressive. There is the essence of life, heart and soul in her voice and it's so wonderful to hear something like this in this day and age, at least for me anyway.<br /><br />\\"Willy\\" is a more sombre song where Joni's voice is very sorrowful. The piano changes its tone in accordance to Joni's delivery. Lyrics such as \\"And counting all the cars up the hill, and the stars on my window sill, there are still more reasons why I love him.\\" It's three minutes of pure classic Joni. \\"The Arrangement\\" is one of my favourite Joni songs ever. The piano introduction is just heart-breaking, I feel so privileged to just hear it. Joni's voice is gorgeous in this song, as she sings about not feeling wanted in life, and how hard it is to keep pushing on in a world where you feel so alone. Around 2:34 Joni starts her 'wailing' but when it goes so high, and so passionate, you can't help but feel your soul rip in half! It's like she grabs a hold of you and forces you to listen. Stunning. \\"Rainy Night House\\" is a very depressing song, you can almost hear the pouring rain against a window of this night house. The lyrics tells the story of a man who (with his girlfriend) goes up to his mother's night house while she is away. There's a sense of being somewhere you shouldn't be in this song, very ambiguous and almost tragic, emphasised the soprano wail. \\"The Priest\\" is probably my least favourite song on the album, but it's still very good. It's quite upbeat and the lyrics are quite eerie. Joni's vocal delivery is very strange and annoys me sometimes, because she draws every last word out. The guitar is what creates this unnerving effect in me every time I hear this song, also the fact it seems to be quitereligion-orientated.<br /><br />\\"Blue Boy\\" is a very sad song about a man who comes to Joni's place only for sex. They fall asleep together, but he's always gone when she wakes up in the morning. Then she stares out of her bedroom window and sees a statue that always looks the same. When Joni draws out the line, \\"Oh...\\" at the end of each verse, the crackling in her voice is the sound of pure heartache. So powerful. \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" is arguably Joni's most famous song ever, becoming an instant classic upon its release and ascending in status and notoriety as each decade passes. It's a song about the tragedy of modernity and how old things are so often replaced and forgotten by new things. Musically, it's very upbeat and fun. \\"Woodstock\\" is a classic hit that the very legendary event itself was named after! Not many artists can say that they had something so big named after one of their songs. Joni performs beautifully on the electric piano, giving this song a deep, old-age atmosphere and a sense of time passing. Her voice is all over the place and quite out of melody, but that was always Joni's trademark, and she works it perfectly here. The album closes with the stunning \\"The Circle Game.\\" This song was written and recorded by Joni way back in 1966, exactly 40 years ago! It's a gorgeous song though, the melody is incredible and the vocals give the effect of rotation, coming full circle.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />Joni Mitchell created many masterpieces throughout her time in the music industry. I believe that Ladies Of The Canyon was her first true masterpiece. From then on, they came thick and fast with \\"Blue,\\" \\"Court And Spark,\\" \\"The Hissing Of Summer Lawns,\\" and \\"Hejira.\\" The rate that these albums came out (usually a new one every year) was also incredible. Many artists take four or five years in the present day to get a truly great album out. Joni was doing it every year, which is just one of the many reasons why she is a legend, a treasure of singer-songwriting beauty and the most revered woman of music in the 20th Century.uite religion-orientated. <br /> <br />\\"Blue Boy\\" is a very sad song about a man who comes to Joni's place only for sex.

B0001RVTXO|1.0|I thought about buying this one, but then I remembered -- I own it already.  A decade ago they called it \\"Death to the Pixies.\\"  The DVD is interesting though. <br /> <br />Death to the Pixies, on the other hand, is a dual-disc set: one being a good mix of Pixies sounds, the other being a live show.  Buy that one.  It makes more sense.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|I thought I was never going to get out of the jungle. I knew eventually we were going to wind up in New York City, but after two hours we were still on the island.  The visuals were good, but the gymnastic abilities of the characters was a bit much. The female lead had more lives than a cat and the characters outrunning a herd of brontosaurus size dinosaurs was pretty hokey too.  They definitely could have shortened the film and made it more tolerable to sit through. King Kong sliding on the ice rink in Central Park was a little much to take as well. I liked the original version made in 1933. Even the 1970's version was better.
B0007TKNL0|1.0|Wish I could give negative stars...this would be -10, at least. I'm not opposed to musicals, but this was so slow and boring, it was painful...pure torture trying to sit through it! I finally broke...and hit the fast-forward, and it still sucked.  The only reason I can imagine that this film has garnered such praise, is the ever expanding stupidity of our general population. Watching this had to have killed brain cells - avoid it!  Watch something of quality - \\"Remains of the Day\\", \\"The English Patient\\", \\"The Long Engagement\\", \\"Heat and Dust\\", \\"Howard's End\\"...and I could go on and on since there are thousands of outstanding productions - a list on which the \\"Phantom of Cr*p\\" will never deserve to be.

B00005Q4CS|4.0|at first, i hated this movie. it was so depressing. now i love it. it is a moving film that shows a downfall of all four characters. they seem to be ultra content until they try and try to make things better. i won't give anything major away, but ill say this. watch it with someone the first time or it will be very depressing.
B0002S947K|5.0|This is my new makin' love CD. It's so soulful, so smooth, so sensitive. Ray LaMontagne's voice is what Ben Harper would sound like if he hung out with Van Morrison in high school. The instrumentation is along the lines of The Band or Dylan, or even ballady CCR tunes like \\"Long As I Can See the Light.\\" In fact, there's a little hint of Fogarty in the vocals too, but smoothed out. The first time I heard this album, it seemed familiar. Not like Top 40 Pop, where it all sounds the same... but like an old friend that you never met.
B0006IF92U|4.0|Very nicely packaged 2 disc set with lots of photos of the lovely Aussie Delta Goodrem both on the CD case and the 16 page enclosed booklet. Booklet also contains the lyrics to all 14 tracks.<br /><br />You always have to wonder about daytime television stars when they decide they're also a singer. Well, this one is. All in all an enjoyable array of safe songs that don't challenge her vocal range so it's a little difficult to tell how good she really is. I'd love to see her perform live, she's definitely very easy on the eyes!
B00006JKON|5.0|If you can afford to listen to their recordings do so. I was fortunate to witness, way back in 1974, a live WarChild tour concert. An unusually talented group of musicians, whose performance, has dramatic arts written all over it. Theosophy spirited notes, chords, and drum beats, of individuality while an alluring theme is ever present. The \\"WarChild\\" recording depicts, melodic bass guitar and string bass notes, subtle and accenting electric guitar, syncopating acoustic and spanish guitar, stylish presence of organ, piano, synthesisers, and piano accordian, strong baritone vocals and embellishing flute, alto, soprano, and sopranino saxophones, marvelous drums, glockenspiel, marimba and sundry percussion add the fine orchestration utilizing the members of the Philamusica of London. The inspired musical score, and poetic lyrics are as one, so typical of Ian Anderson's signature song writing. Brilliant and colorful expression of human circumstance, performed by the great classic rock group, Jethro Tull.
B0007Y08QA|3.0|If movies were acclaimed for their actors strict discipline then Christian Bale would win best actor for this movie and the movie would win best picture! But since movies aren't acclaimed for the strictness of their actors. This movie is just OK. If you're a Chtistian Bale fan like I am then you will be amazed at how thin he got for this role. Literally about 120Lbs. And Bale's acting (as always) is solid in this film. But the story is one that has been played out as of recent. Although I will give this movie a little credit for not being exactly like all the rest of the \\"The main character is insane and he's the one doing everything to himself movies\\". This one IS a little bit different. But then again it is reletively predictable. <br /> <br />All in all I would only recommend this for the biggest of Bale fans  and even then. RENT IT!
B00006674X|4.0|This movie is enjoyable if flawed (holding a child for 8 hours straight won't cure autism).  Elvis as Dr. Dreamboat is gorgeous, (despite mutton chops) I just wish that MTM as Sister Michelle wasn't such a quavery nervous wreck.  (and besides, she looks like a chipmunk in her full habit at the end). Elvis is very natural with the mediocre dialogue, a shame that he was under the thumb of his manager and didn't get more dramatic roles, he surely could have handled them.  (Check out Jailhouse Rock for a comparison)  <br /> <br /> Watching this while I was growing up, I hoped that Sr. Michelle would choose the doctor over the church, (which we are frustratingly left to figure out ourselves). But now I think his character would have been happier with the nun who definitely leaves in the end!   <br /> <br /> If not the best written Elvis movie (with stereotypes and heavy handed messages galore) at least it's nice to see him in a dramatec role.  It meant well as a commentary on the times, it just needed a bit more fine tuning.  The opening 'striptease' by the nuns (they change from habits to streetclothes) certainly sends a mixed message and some might say a sacriligious one too, but for the most part, it's just immature and a bit ridiculous.  <br /> <br />I still like this picture if just for Elvis alone!    <br /> <br />
0553801503|2.0|I was delighted to stumble across A Game of Thrones in 1998 and to read the sequels over the next couple of years.  I admired Martin for his world building, his character development, and for the plot risks he took, like killing off major characters. <br /> <br />When he announed his writer's block and took a break from writing to make sure that Book 4 was as good Books 1-3, I was all for it.  I admired him all the more for respecting his readers enough to deliver quality over quantity (*cough* Robert Jordan *cough*). <br /> <br />The problem is, he took too long.  After five years I've forgotten a lot about Westeros and I don't want to read this instalment only to face another five year wait for the next one.   <br /> <br />And unfortunately it looks like the five year wait was not worth it.  The reviews so far aren't up to par.  I am glad he was able to get the book out, but I'm not excited about paying full price for half a book. <br /> <br />I'll be sure to read the rest of the series, but only after Martin has finished writing it.  There are three lessons I've learned from Martin, Jordan et al: <br /> <br />First, if I can wait five years for a book to come out, I can wait until the entire series is out. <br /> <br />Second, even an author as good as Martin can stumble, so you can't rely on an author's quality when choosing a new series.  Implicit in any series is a pledge from the author to deliver good works in a timely fashion, so that the readers are not left sitting for years between instalments.  Jordan broke the pledge by lowering his quality while keeping up quantity, and Martin skirted the line with a five year wait for half a book. <br /> <br />Third, there are so many good COMPLETED doorstopper series out there.  Robin Hobb has an excellent nine book series, Julian May remains one of my favorite authors with a nine part series as well, Tad Williams has two completed series under his belt, Peter Hamilton has a riveting trilogy and Kate Elliott in particular recently completed her intelligent quasi-European medieval Crown of Stars series (if you like Westeros, you will enjoy her series).  These and other authors can tide all of us over until Martin has finished his oeuvre.
B000002UB3|5.0|Side 1 is something of a mixed bag. There are two types of people: those who like \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and those who don't. I'm in the former category (kinda), though apparently John hated it. \\"Come Together\\" is good, but never sounds the same after you hear the Chuck Berry tune that Lennon lifted \\"Come Together\\" from. No one dislikes \\"Something,\\" which John was probably right in saying was the best song on the record (if not, at least it was George's best song ever), but \\"Oh! Darling\\" would've been better had they recorded John belting it out on the roof of the Apple building. Ringo gets to sing the jolly \\"Octopus's Garden,\\" in which the boys blow bubbles with straws stuck in a tub of water. Gotta love pre-computer sound effects! I think \\"She's So Heavy,\\" with its heavy metal riffs, should've been played after John sang \\"Oh! Darling\\" on top of the Apple building. Side 1 was conceived to please John, who didn't want Abbey Road to be another Sgt. Pepper. The real joy, however, is Side 2, Paul's side, which might be the best thing ever done by a pop group. Much of it includes song fragments that John and Paul had hanging around from the fertile India trip. With George Martin's help, Paul turned those fragments into 23 minutes of outstanding music. \\"Polythene Pam\\" is one of the most rocking songs the Beatles did. \\"Because,\\" whether or not it is \\"Moonlight Sonata\\" played backwards, is one of the most beautiful. Paul contributes the most complex tune, \\"You Never Give Me Your Money,\\" which blends nicely into the wonderful \\"Sun King,\\" with great harmonies and John's nonsense Spanish-Italian lyrics at the end. Paul gets sad on \\"Golden Slumbers,\\" gets happier with \\"Carry that Weight,\\" and three quarters of the Fab Four end the album by trading guitar riffs on \\"The End.\\" Before the guitar blowout, Ringo gets a drum solo. Finally. \\"Abbey Road\\" was the last album the Beatles recorded, though they'd release \\"Let It Be\\" later. They certainly ended on a high note. But, guys, couldn't you have stayed together until 1973 or 1974? Oh well. We'll just have to keep playing this one.couldn't you have stayed together until 1973 or 1974? Oh well.

B000002IKR|5.0|this album is just great. Testament is an extreemly underrated thrash metal band that everyone should listen to. \\"Burnt Offerings\\" is the best song, but \\"Over the Wall\\", \\"Raging Waters\\", \\"First Strike Is Deadly\\", and \\"Apoctolyptic City\\" are amazing too. All the songs are good though. If you like metal you must get this album.
0802130208|5.0|I am utterly obsessed with this novel.  I am an avid reader and finally got around to reading this gem, never imagining that it would affect me so profoundly.  Ignatius is a fictional character without equal - unparalled in his bombastic ramblings, unabashed egotism, and unintentional wit.  A Confederacy of Dunces is an irreverent comedy, tinged with undertones of sadness and apathy.  I have read and re-read passages that have caused me to both chuckle and laugh out loud.  In my opinion, an unquestionable must read!
1932100385|5.0|This was one of the most powerful and enlightening books I've EVER read. Upon being diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2005, I immediately switched to a low-fat plant-based whole foods diet based on web research I did. I was a cheese-aholic, chocoholic, junk food junkie who could eat anything because I'm so active. Needless to say, it was very depressing at first. But within 8 days, my chronic sciatic and joint pain completely disappeared; within 6 weeks, my cholesterol dropped from 191 to 148; my energy levels soared and I went through cancer surgery and missed only two days of work, then went through 6 weeks of daily radiation and had no ill effects. In fact I play soccer 4 times a week and missed only one game during the whole ordeal. It's almost a year later, and I still have unlimited energy and excellent health. In December I read The China Study and was floored by the incredible powerful evidence of this diet on good health. The China Study explained the science behind my personal experience. I emailed everyone I know about this book, and now have three additional friends who changed their diet and now call me their hero because allergies, joint pain, and high cholesterol simply vanished. I'm not the hero - T. Colin Campbell is the hero. Once you read his book, you'll never again be confused by headlines about the latest \\"study\\" results that seem to conflict with \\"everything we've been told\\".

0895260131|4.0|Robert Spencer tried to be as balanced as possible in his approach in writing this book. He has provided his research material convincingly. As a person living in a multi-cultural and religious country, this book would definitely be banned here for the fear of inciting instability between believers of Islam and other faiths. Robert pulls no punches in his criticsm of Islam to the point that it felt like a personal vendetta, but he brings his points and historical research across well. I think everyone should read the book with an open mind and decide whether to believe what is written.

0553573403|5.0|Wow, I hate to just go with the crowd here, but these books are a refreshing breath. No absurd, kitschy magic and the historical accuracy of them makes them incredibly informative. I must say that I had my doubts at the beginning of the book-what are these children all about? Where's my lithe, perfect hero? Where's my ultimate struggle between good and evil? Perhaps this is simply since I have trouble getting into books initially, but if you hold any of the same reservations I did, don't. These books are intelligent, sexy, and simply amazing to read. Neither are they predictable or unrealistic-people drop like flies when odds prevail against them. I'm in constant search of that book that's just impossible to put down and here it is. If you haven't read this series, get with the program, jump on the bandwagon, and be proud of your conformity. These novels are loved for a reason.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This movie shows little comprehension of the book, the time, or the author.  <br />The director thought he could be edgy by making everyone seem dirty. Since Rob Roy and Braveheart, directors think they can make movies seem more historically accurate by showing filthy living conditions. This is Jane Austen. She writes about landed gentry in 19th century England, the motherland of domestic comfort, baths, and little scented soaps. The \\"people that don't live in the modern western world are dirty\\" concept is trite, inaccurate, and overdone.  <br />Major alterations are made to Austen's original characters. <br />-Mary is given some of Elizabeth's lines, putting a spotlight on her character that was never intended. <br />-The marital problems between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are glossed over. There is even a scene where they chat in bed. That they are a horrible match is very important to Elizabeth's ideas of matrimony. <br />- Mr. Bennet is shown as an all around good father who shows no preference to Elizabeth. He even hugs Mary after her embarassing piano performance.  <br /> <br />There are plenty of other problems. It is a pretty film, but in the way that a Bronte movie should be filmed, dark and gothic. Keira Knightly's portrayal of Elizabeth contains way too much Keira Knightly, Lydia is badly done, Mrs. Bennet is underdone, Mr. Darcy is awful. The best casting is Jane's character and Caroline Bingley.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, if you like the book, don't watch this. Spend the extra time with the 1995 BBC version.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|Like watching a group walk by a unique painting for the first time, The Constant Gardener will evoke different emotions and feelings from everyone that gazes upon it.  Critics far and wide have praised this film as a deeply political thriller that speaks passionately about the corruption surrounding the pharmaceutical companies, while there have been others that have called this the best \\"revenge\\" story to be released in the past decade (apparently they missed Oldboy).  Hearing these comments shouted at me from nearly every angle, I wasn't sure what to expect from this Oscar nominated film.  I had to see it for myself.  When I walked by this shattering portrait of humanity and humility, The Constant Gardener spoke to me about at theme that many have refused to acknowledge, I saw this as an immaculate love story.  What transforms this tale from your typical romantic thriller is the way that director Fernando Meirelles has crafted his story.  Taking it from the pages of acclaimed writer John le Carr&eacute;, Meirelles uses apt cinematography, non-linear storytelling, and bold characters that sweep you passionately off your feet and never put you down.  It is told convincingly and sublimely enough that emotion will grip you by the end and make you hold your loved one even closer.<br /><br />I would like to quote a line form this film that I believe summarizes this film in its entirety.  I use this line because it has remained in my mind long after the final scene of this film.  The line that I refer to is said as Justin is passing, almost secretively and mean spirited, by his wife Tessa.  It is a simple line that I believe was the first time I really saw this film for what it was.  The line is, \\"It's like it's a marriage of convenience and all it produces are dead offspring.\\"  When you read this line, especially in the context it is used in the film, it gives off the sensation of anger and hatred in a bitter, disastrous relationship.  Yet, when it is used again in this film it shows the passion in both of these characters, and really opens your eyes to the truth surrounding this amazing motion picture.  I cannot stress this idea enough, but The Constant Gardener was on the surface a thriller/espionage film, but when looked upon closer, I saw this as one of the most amazing love stories told.  That may be big of me to say, but I believe that director Fernando Meirelles has transformed the idea of your typical love story and demonstrated his cinematic power to create a genre that has been recycled through Hollywood time and again.  Meirelles has rediscovered the romantic love story and provided a modern day twist, coupled with insecurities, passion, and of course, political lies.<br /><br />Again, maybe I am speaking too generally about this film, but it was difficult to see this film as a \\"first-rate spy game\\" as the cover of the DVD boasts.  The connection between Fiennes and Weisz is immaculate.  Never before have I witnessed a finer pairing in Hollywood.  The two ooze with passion for each other, while both securing themselves so well in their characters that you forget that they are actors.  I believe that Fiennes is one of the greatest actors of our generation.  He has this ability to play down characters, as in this film, and suddenly bring them out in such a force that you never saw it coming.  Weisz has those eyes.  By this I mean her eyes can lie to us and reveal so little.  The beginning of this film is a perfect example.  During the couple's first courtship Fiennes says something along the lines of, \\"...thank you for that gift\\", and she responds with some line, but her eyes say something different.  It is hard to find actresses so dedicated to finding their character completely that it was refreshing to see that in Weisz's performance.  I do believe she deserves the credit that she is finding.<br /><br />The Constant Gardener worked because it was not an American story.  I find myself getting sleepy over the tales aboutthe evils of America.  While I believe that we are at fault for several issues in this world, I do believe that seeing the British involved in an American-esque scandal only strengthened the overall tone of this film.  Yet, something impressed me by this film, midway through this movie, I couldn't care less about the political issues.  I could have cared less about the pharmaceutical statement that was attempting to be made.  What I did care about, and why I think Meirelles did such a superb job of directing this film, were the characters.  I found myself lost in the technical espionage lingo, and instead found myself glued to Justin and Tessa.  Again, their chemistry, their passion, their love, their secrets are what made this film so thrilling.  This wasn't a story about a cover-up (while that would be the film covering the surface of this movie), but instead was a story about love, marriage, and loyalty.  I found myself more excited about learning about these two people than I did about the drug scandal.  I think, at least I hope, that was Meirelles overall point of the story ... shock the audiences by throwing a love story into the mix.  I didn't see it coming when I started this film, and that is why I believe I loved this film so much.<br /><br />One cannot talk about this film without talking about the power behind Meirelles' camera.  This could have been another simple Hollywood \\"who-dun-it\\", but instead Meirelles takes it several steps further and creates a portrait of corruption coupled with love.  His quick shots, off-centered close-ups, and grainy character camera angles were sublime.  What kept me glued to my seat were not these long, drawn out picturesque landscape scenes, but instead, flash shots coupled with beautiful imagery.  I don't know whom he uses, but it was a similar feel to his other amazing film, City of God.  In both of these, Meirelles uses modern cinematography, classic tales and plot devises, and constructs some of the best cinema to be released.  He is a master of his trade, and The Constant Gardener proves it.<br /><br />Overall, I was very impressed with this film.  I was angry at the beginning, curious towards the middle, and sad by the end.  Who else can say this about an espionage caper that does not involve huge explosions or meddling bad guys?  Who else, outside of Fernando Meirelles, can capture this range of emotion in a film?  Why is his work constantly breaking boundaries in cinema and reaching better expectations each time?  He does this by keeping us, the viewers, on our toes.  He does this by not conforming to typical Hollywood standards and keeping his own sense of originality and independence.  He does this by keeping his camera modern, while his stories are not.  He does this by employing amazing actors whom are at the top of their game.  He does this by creating films like The Constant Gardener.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****t the evils of America.

0679720200|5.0|This is a great book and you don't need to hear another praise or exaltation of its message. Suffice it to say, in its depth the author condemns emotions. Camus asks one simple question - if emotions are removed from humanity then what is the outcome of human existence? I can't ignore the fact that this book is inevitable tied with another - the discourse of Simon Cleveland in his book 'Existential Meditation'.  Cleveland's analysis on the meaning of time, consciousness and the development of the essence doesn't stray away from Camus' own conviction that emotions are the downfall of humanity. Of course the absurdity of immortality is a whole other issue. <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I would love to get into how much I thoroughly enjoyed this interpretation of Pride and Prejudice, but my real issue at hand is the Region One (United States and Canada) dvd. I am aware that it does come with the 'add on ending' in which Darcy and Bennet kiss, but what I would like to know is why the producers have cut the extra features! <br /> <br />The UK edition of the film will have all sorts of extras on the locations of the shoots and the homes that were used. I am disappointed that we are not going to be given that same priviledge even though we saw the same movie! I would buy the Region 2 dvd, but it also requires that dvd player which quite frankly makes me mad because the R1 dvd is getting screwed! <br /> <br />Also take into the consideration that the R1 dvd also only has Knightley's name on the cover, what about Macfadyen?!!
B00005JLSE|1.0|Okay, I do not get what all the hype was about this movie, I watched like 15 minutes of it and was out like a light- if I need to sleep I can count on this DVD!
B000007ODM|5.0|I would give it 6 stars if I could. This is a masterpiece that you will enjoy over and over again. This is the best of all ERA albums. Go for it - you will not regret it
B00063MBU8|4.0|Alrite. I don't even like rock music i'm a massive rap fan but my girlfriend likes all dat rock stuff n she plays dis all the time n it's okay. You got peeps dat love this album n peeps dat hate. Some of u think coz u like music dat shouts like Marylin Manson or whatever that this ain't good n that it's good to hate on them. This is an ok album and coming from someone who hates rock that's a compliment!! Worth buyin for sure.
B000A2RRF4|4.0|sorry, this is not really a review of the product since I didn't buy it yet... - just wanted to let you know that those girls were *mainly* fainting because of the lack of... air, not because they'd seen MJ..! - almost incredible, but sardines in a can were more comfortable... - now, what pushed everybody (physically) closer and closer to MJ (and made the first rows to evaporate due to massive fainting) is another story... - yes, the MJ's performance, the show itself, were outstanding. I will buy the DVD whatever the sound... maybe I can see myself there!
B000060P79|4.0|Ur a metal fan that likes Tupac. Pac was the greatest rapper that ever lived. Try sticking to ur own music n don't invade the world of hip-hop that u no nothing about.

Good album worth buying. <br /> <br />RIP Tupac Amaru Shakur <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0930289528|4.0|V for Vendetta should serve as a grim warning to people.  When we give up our freedom for more protection, we must be careful about what it is exactly that we give up.  After all, after giving up one liberty, it only becomes easier to give up the next one to feel more protected.  In the London depicted in the book, people have given up nearly every liberty.  Surveillance cameras moniter people's every move, curfews dictate when people can move around the city, and quarrantine zones dictate where people can go.  There are food rations across the country.  Relocation camps were set up to remove blacks, gays, socialists, and non-Christians from society, all in the name of protection.  And radio and television broadcasts are all controlled by the government, assuring that only pro-government propaganda can reach the masses (even entertainment is used for propaganda; just look at the Storm Saxon movies). <br />All of these protections are due to a worldwide nuclear war that ravaged nearly every country on Earth.  Billions of people died, the weather was forever altered, and most of the world's food supply was wiped out (hence the rationing).  There was chaos.  So a ruling party took over in England to end the chaos and restore order.  Only they did it too well.  Citizens are prisoners to protection, and most of them don't mind. <br />Except V.  V is a terrorist who employs trickery and deception in order to carry out his agenda.  Though he once believed in justice, now all he cares about is anarchy, and he begins blowing up buildings and undermining the government in order to get the people to rule themselves.  One night, he helps a young woman named Evey Hammond who was going to be raped and killed by secret police, and the two form a kind of alliance. <br />The strange thing about this book is that there is no real \\"good guy\\".  Yes, the government is corrupt and facist, but V is a terrorist in pursuit of anarchy.  Some of the things he does are atrocious.  The questionreaders have to ask is who they would support if given the choice between corrupt facism and violent anarchy. <br />Overall, this is a great story.  The art was fair, and caused me to get some characters confused, but that shouldn't prevent you from reading this book, which is seen as one of the best graphic novels in history.
B00008YLV2|5.0|Loved the movie the first time I saw it. I read the book first so I could point some of the changes that were made. I reserve my criticisms of war films because I have never been to war so I have no idea what it is like. I read other reviews criticizing the representation of Somalis and I thought it was fine. People are people. I know both sides are human and it's sad when anyone dies. If you need a movie to point that out for you then that's pretty sad. The mission was well intentioned and things went wrong along the way and people died. I don't know see why this film got criticized as much as it did, only from people with a certain ideological point of view. If we (and the UN) hadn't gotten involved then people would be screaming about why we didn't intervene when people were starving.  <br />Summary of movie: Well intentioned mission gone wrong. <br />Great but sad film
B00006FDCJ|5.0|\\"You take away all he's got, and all he's ever gonna have.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Unforgiven\\" is one of the greatest MOVIES of all time.  None of the good guys are completely good and none of the bad guys are completely bad.  This investigation of morality is very thought provoking. <br /> <br />This is the most realistic western I've ever seen.  You don't have gunslinging superheros like in \\"The Outlaw Josie Wales\\" and \\"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\\", characters here can and do miss and make mistakes.  When Munny says \\"I was lucky in the order, but I've always been lucky when it comes to killin' folk.\\" you know that's the reason he's survived and not that he has superhuman talent or quickness with a gun. <br /> <br />Also realistic is the way a gunbattle unfolds, where some of the people don't even fire, and one guy doesn't fire when he's safe and has a clear shot.  I read that nearly 1/2 of the soldiers in the revolutionary war didn't shoot at other soldiers.  The taboo of killing another human being was so strong that they would purposefully fire over the heads of the enemy soldiers instead of at them.  Some soldiers that were killed were found with many balls still in their muskets; they would act like they were firing but not pull the trigger and would have to \\"reload\\" to keep up appearances.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The show seemed slow and almost boring at first, but after you watch each of the wonderfully made shows, you can't stop thinking about the show, and wanting to see more.  Try it, you'll love the imaginative story, oddly compatible cast of characters and great special effects.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I went and saw the movie after it came out on video and had to see all the episodes of the show itself.  After seeing the final one, I can say that this show was absolute perfection.  It's like Star Wars told from the perspective of Han Solo, rather than Luke Skywalker, with the gunslinging smuggler and his crew being the main focus in the war against some Galactic Empire, rather than some mystical Jedi Knight.  Also, the war's over.  The Rebels lost and all is under the dominion of the Galactic Empire/Alliance which is mysterious while being deceptively kind and \\"civilized\\" as all governments are.  <br />     In fact, I almost wonder if Joss Whedon is a libertarian.  There are some subtle anti-government elements in the show, such as in the vein of \\"1984\\".  Is is just me, or is anti-statism a major theme in most sci-fi? <br />    This show has the best of all the elements.  Great actors and actresses playing great characters with great dialogue, great plots, plot twists, music (whom hasn't memorized the lyrics to the theme song by the end?).  It's mostly a sci-fi Western with some elements of horror (who was freaked out by the blue-gloved men and their antics in the \\"Aerial\\" episode) and really great casual humor as well (who wasn't roaring in laughter during the episode where Jayne was mistaken by a town as some kind of Robin Hood-esque hero?). <br />     If you don't think that this show will go down as legendary, then name one other show that got cancelled after only eleven aired episodes (fourteen total) and yet had such a huge cult following of fans built around it that they made a movie out of it? <br />     In short, this series is absolute bliss and well worth your purchase.
0375703764|5.0|Four-and-a-half stars, actually. <br /> <br />House of Leaves is a story within a story within another story, all part of yet another story.  The main story (although I use that phrase cautiously) concerns the Navidson Record, the story of an impossible house complete with infinite and existential space.  The Navidson Record was initially compiled by Zampano, a blind old man about whom little is known.  Zampano's work is found and expanded upon by Johnny Truant, who also tells his own story along in the way.  Finally, in the extensive appendices, we find the Whalestoe Letters, written by Johnny's mother, which offers yet another fractured view of the Navidson Record and its surrounding stories, bringing into question the reality and meaning of everything in House of Leaves. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book immensely, despite a slow start.  At first I worried that it was somewhat pretentious, and that some of the tricks used-the extensive footnotes that often overlap each other, the shifting nature of the text, and the clues and hints hidden throughout-got to be too much.  However, as I read on I saw (at least in my opinion) how it all fit together.   <br /> <br />The existential nothingness of the house could be over-analyzed on an intellectual level; it could be catalogued in hopes of a pattern emerging; it could be explored pointlessly even though all that such explorations would reveal is oneself; it could be interpreted on any number of levels from different perspectives and methods; and, finally, it could be ignored or even feared, left merely as a mystery.  And yet it still was it was. <br /> <br />I liked the core story about the house and I grew to like the other stories that layered upon it.  At first, I thought Johnny's story was just sex, drugs, and working at a tattoo shop, but then I saw more of who he was and how what he did was a part of the whole.  (For me one of the best parts of the book was when Johnny cited a list of Lude's sexual conquests within a month-and then turned that list around to reveal possible backgrounds of abuse and personal problems for all those women.) <br /> <br />One thing I didn't share with other readers was that I didn't find the book at all scary, but more fascinating.  It was a treasure hunt for me, a work I had to figure out while at the same time following along as a reader.  I would say, though, that people looking for a straightforward story should not read House of Leaves.  Those looking for something different, something to consume your time and thoughts, should read the book immediately. <br />
B000A59PMO|4.0|Veronica Mars has all the elements of a great show.  It's got mystery, soap, humor, and heart.  It is addictive.  That said, the DVD offers very little in the way of extras.  A few deleted scenes are all that are included.
B000002IOW|4.0|\\"Presto\\" was released in late 1989 and marks a \\"rebirth\\" of sorts for Rush - a moving away from keyboards and a return to the \\"power trio\\" sound that made them popular.<br /><br />The songs on \\"Presto\\" are all superb.  Every one of them.  Stand-outs (for me anyway) are \\"Chain Lightning\\" and the sublime \\"Available Light\\" (featuring Geddy Lee's best vocal performance EVER).<br /><br />However, Rupert Hine's production takes the hard edge off the songs too much.  The songs sound a little too \\"white, clean, and neat\\" for this listener.  Too English, too polite; almost STERILE sounding.  And that's really too bad; this is a great collection of songs.
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|The first time I rented this movie, I fell asleep half way through. The second time, I fell asleep again. Undeterred, I went on to watch the first season of the Stand Alone Complex TV series and then to read the original GITS manga in its English-language collected form. Having been hooked by the ideas and the characters, I came back to the movie and instead of finding it slow and somewhat impenetrable, it struck me as far too constrained by time limitations to do the story justice. So I guess it all depends on your viewpoint and how much you already know about the world in which GITS is set and the characters who populate it. <br /> <br />Now I am a lot more familiar with the GITS world, I would strongly recommend that anyone struggling with the original movie does stick with it, and then goes on to watch the TV series as well. The latter may not have the same production values but does have the time to expand on many ideas and develop the characters much better than the film could possibly do. <br /> <br />This is a world in which people can truly live \\"inside their heads\\" (or indeed, other people's heads) and in which the external body has largely become insignificant. This is a very attractive concept for anyone who already tends to think this way and regard their brain as their most significant body part, if not the only one. It's a world in which physical pain and sickness is limited to those who have not chosen to become full cyborgs, sexuality is potentially irrelevant as anyone with a cyber-brain can switch to an outwardly opposite gendered body, and we can presume that lifespans are extended and far more predictable than they are today. But there are flaws in this futuristic Shangri-La, not the least of which is that people are still people and however perfect their bodies may be, they still struggle with concepts of identity, still strive for power, still feel emotional pain and are still prey to all those human weaknesses that are independent of the \\"shell\\". <br /> <br />The movie and the television series both carefully overlook the sexuality of the main character, although there are indications that there may be something more than a business relationship developing between the Major and Batou in the first season of SAC. In the manga, though, which is intended for a more adult audience, the Major does have a boyfriend and also indulges her sexual inclinations elsewhere. It's definitely worth bearing this in mind when you judge the characters in the movie, which does not have the time to develop them nor the adult certificate it would need to do so. Despite being almost entirely robotic, these are still \\"real\\" people and their acceptance of mechanical forms and the compromises they have to make in return for the benefits they gain are a significant aspect of the story. <br /> <br />I would say that if there is a flaw in this movie it is that too much has to be compressed into too short a time. Things develop too fast and are too soon over, and explanations have to be passed by in order to get to the end of the story in time. It's not unusual for Japanese storytelling to be thin on explanations but in this case you really do wish you could spend more time with the characters before it's all over. If you find yourself hooked by the concepts of life with a cyber-brain but left wanting to explore more when the movie is over, do follow up with the original manga and the TV series and you won't regret it.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Solaris is proof, like Gattaca, that science fiction movies do not need an overabundance of flashy special effects and futuristic gadgets to be science fiction.<br /><br />Solaris does more with less. Much shorter than the Russian filmed version, both based on the Stanislaw Lew movel, Solaris is a overlooked gem of a movie that ruthlessly explores the problem that arises. The solution at the end is the only one possible, a transcendental one, but I can't see how any other works for this movie.<br /><br />I expressed a theory to a co-worker that George Clooney movies where he *doesn't* play the \\"rogue with a heart of gold\\" character he is famous for (Out of Sight, Three Kings, O Brother, The Billy Ocean movies, etc) don't seem to do well at the box office, no matter how well the movies are made. Solaris, which only took in $15 million at the US Box office in 2002 (after costing 4 times that to make) seems to fit this mold.<br /><br />Besides the wonderful acting from Clooney, McElhrone, Davis and Davies, the soundtrack also makes this movie a complete experience. I wish I had picked up the soundtrack the day I saw this in theaters, it is now out of print and expensive to obtain.<br /><br />And what would *you* do if someone you lost came back to you, someone who was torn away from you?<br /><br />I know there are those who prefer the Russian version of the film, but, honestly, I find that one slow and tedious. The Soderbergh version is short, tight and spare.<br /><br />Solaris is one of my favorite movies and I commend the movie to anyone.
B00005U11Z|4.0|Journey does a much better job of replacing a very known singer better than groups often do.  But of course the real gem here is MR. NEAL SCHON.

B000BKVQTS|3.0|It should have been so much better.<br /><br />Heath Ledger and Matt Damon play the titular characters, re-imagined in this movie as con artists who fake supernatural happenings in towns in Germany during the Napoleonic Wars, collecting handsome fees for clearing up the problem that they themselves have created. Will (Damon) is the \\"Face\\" of the team, suavely selling their snake oil, while Jacob (Ledger) is the brains of the team, coming up with their gadgets and knowing his folklore.<br /><br />Their con artistry runs into the French Army, annoyed at their antics, but even more annoyed that in a nearby town, someone seems to be copying the Grimm's con game, and upped the ante by kidnapping children. The Grimms are charged with unmasking their counterparts, but what they find is real magic going on in the forest of Marbden.<br /><br />The movie doesn't seem to know what tone to take or what it wants to be. Shifting from humor to horror to action-adventure with whiplash speed, precious little seems to remain stable for long periods. Are the Grimms physical cowards, or not? Just what tone is Gilliam trying to hit and keep missing? There are lots of references to fairy tales and characters in the movie, it almost seems the point, especially when those tales seem out of place with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />And the movie has Monica Bellucci, but underutilizes her. Stromare's character starts off as a villain, but changes sides near the end. It's a necessary change so that the Grimms can survive, but its one that we are not prepared for, there seems no reason for it.<br /><br />That said, there are lovely visuals and some ideas thrown into this mess of a movie. Unlike a lot of movies out there, it gives a college try to entertaining its public. I just wish Gilliam had spent a little longer rewriting and making the script more orderly.<br /><br />If you like Gilliam's work, or fairy tales, you might like it--but be prepared to possibly be disappointed.
B000002UAX|5.0|Of all the years that may have been the turning point of the 1960s, 1968 was one of the most pivotal years in terms of politics, culture, and most of all music.  Out of this year came one of the most eclectic albums to be released, The Beatles' White Album.  This record defines what direction rock and roll was heading, and who better to lead the transition from AM pop to FM album oriented rock than the band who changed the face of rock and roll just four years earlier in 1964?<br /><br />After a short respite with Magical Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine, the band regrouped to follow-up their monumental Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band album with The Beatles. The sound is distinguishable on the White Album, and clearly shows each member of the band as individuals.  The ironic thing about the record is how it is fragmented as opposed to the strong cohesion that existed on Pepper.  However, the record stands out in terms of the maturation of the songwriting and musicianship.  This is exemplified with George Harrison's exceptional \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps \\" and a Moody Blues sounding \\"Long, Long, Long\\"  (the piano chords sound like \\"Go Now\\").  Nonetheless, George shines on this record as well as Ringo with \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Goodnight.\\"  Indeed, the songwriting team of Lennon and McCartney has ventured on their own, but seeds of \\"solo career\\" sprout from the songs that each present.<br /><br />The songs that John and Paul present on the White Album bear reflections of their time with the Maharishi as well as their somewhat creative competitiveness. The White Album is the most profound and raunchiest work they have ever done.  The highlights of the album range from the pumping bass line in \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me and My Monkey,\\" The Who-influenced \\"Helter Skelter,\\" the storytelling \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" and \\"The Continuous Story of Bungalow Bill,\\" the blues-driven \\"Yer Blues\\" (Cream or Led Zeppelin-like rock) and \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\" to the sentimental \\"I Will\\" and \\"Julia.\\"  However, John tops the record with the haunting, apocalyptic, experimental, and sublime \\"Revolution 9\\" (as a 12 year old, hearing this particular track with the headphones on and listening to the opening repetition of \\"number nine, number nine\\" and the dissonant tones from a piano playing in the background gave chills and a nightmarish feel down my spine).<br /><br />Overall, this is the Beatles.  The White Album has just about everything on it for any rock and roll listener.  This is the record where many bands after the Beatles have taken a guitar chord or melody and made it their own to give it that Beatles sound.  You have not heard the sound and feel of the late sixties until you've heard this album.It In The Road\\" to the sentimental \\"I Will\\" and \\"Julia.\\"  However, John tops the record with the haunting, apocalyptic, experimental, and sublime \\"Revolution 9\\" (as a 12 year old, hearing this particular track with the headphones on and listening to the opening repetition of \\"number nine, number nine\\" and the dissonant tones from a piano playing in the background gave chills and a nightmarish feel down my spine).  <br /> <br />Overall, this is the Beatles.

B00070DK14|1.0|I just came off listening to Aqualung, and let me warn you, this is no Aqualung.  Although I was impressed by the number of tunes included on this CD, the quality of the songs is poor to average, and many of them sound highly similar to each other.  I can't say that there is even a single good song on this CD.  Some of the songs actually sound quite cheesy, with Casio-style keyboard effects in place of real instruments.  There just is not very much of musical interest on this album.  I'm disappointed, since Tull  had vastly more potential than comes across on this CD.  Too bad.
B0006L16N8|4.0|As a dance music fan, rock music is not my primary genre.  However, this effort by Coldplay is very solid.  I love the upbeat songs like White Shadows, Talk, and the overplayed Speed of Sound.  I do not care much for the slower songs.  On this album I detect a lot of Pink Floyd influence, especially on the opening track.  These guys are good and it's why everyone tries to imitate them; it is the ultimate compliment, but there is no substitute for this amazing band.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|I should share some background before giving my review.<br /><br />Before this past summer, I knew Robbie only through his one and only US hit, \\"Millennium,\\" from 1999.  I always had hoped to hear more music from him, but that never happened here.<br /><br />Flash forward to this past summer.  I, like many millions of other people around the world, watched the Live 8 concerts this summer on-demand via the web.  In the home stretch of the London concert, who appears on stage but Robbie Williams.  Knowing next to nothing about him at that time (he, unfortunately, is very much an obscurity here, as many have noted and rightfully pined) I was absolutely FLOORED not only by his talent as an artist but also by his absolutely amazing skills as a performer.  There very much is a distinction between the two skills...I have seen many talented artists who are mediocre or downright awful entertainers.  Robbie, in the short 20 minutes that he was on stage, demonstrated an incredible talent to take a crowd of several hundred thousand people and wrap every single one of them around his finger.  Talent like this on stage is a one-in-a-million kind of thing, and I can compare him to but a few acts who, in their own right and in their own times, were legends on stage.  It absolutely blew me away, and I replayed that portion of the concert probably 100 times over the summer.<br /><br />I got wind that Robbie released a new album and I was hell-bent on getting a copy of it, never before hearing any of his material off of an album.  I ordered this album, it arrived last week, and I have had a steady diet of Robbie since it arrived to give me a chance to appreciate this work fully.  After many hours of absorbing this album, I came to a conclusion:<br /><br />This album is excellent.<br /><br />\\"Ghosts\\" is a great song.  While others have said that this song may supercede \\"Angels\\" as the audience-favorite anthem, I do not agree...but it is a great song nonetheless.  \\"Tripping\\" is his first single from the album, and it is a pretty strong song.  My favorites may be the songs which are extremely funny to me:  \\"Your Gay Friend\\" and \\"A Place to Crash.\\"  I mean, really...how can you not love songs whose choruses begin<br /><br />\\"And I'll be your gay friend / 'cuz your marriage never ends\\"<br /><br />and<br /><br />\\"Find a place to crash / Move your boney ass\\"<br /><br />The remainder of the songs, too, are quite good.  There are a couple of slower songs to match the up-tempo songs, but there are no \\"true ballads\\" on this album.  I have to spend some more time with this album to gain a better appreciation of a couple of the songs (I'm not placing all of the references), but on the whole it is an excellent album from a truly gifted artist.<br /><br />\\"Greatest Hits\\" are on their way...can't wait.<br /><br />Robbie, brother...you hooked another one here in the US.<br /><br />\\"First they ignore you<br />Then laugh at you and hate you<br />Then they fight you - then you win\\"tty strong song.

B00004ZD69|5.0|This is incredibly powerful for ambient music, this album is great to listen to while driving or engaged in another activity. It is pretty beyond belief, and truely great at building and then coming back down again. I find that it does involve alot of patience though, simply because the songs are so long, and there are many places where they could be easily broken up into various tracks. The background samples mix wonderfully with the instruments, and the strings are great. I can see how this music would not be for everyone, however, becauase many could find it too slow paced, and even anti-climactic. But given the proper chance, one will find it very beautiful and unique. The music seems to almost put you in a trance if you listen to it all the way through. Overall, a great album for a very \\"out-there\\" genre of music.
B0000639F4|5.0|Este es una experiencia unica, si eres un amante de la musica y el arte.  Es increible lo que estos seres humanos pueden hacer con tan pocos medios, la unica explicacion que yo puedo encontrar es su amor a la musica
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This album is beautiful. I have been informed that this album is in Icelandic opposed to their last album \\"( )\\" which was in a made up language called \\"Hopelandic\\". To me, because i dont speak icelandic, the lyrics act as another instrument because of how beautifully they are sung. The whole album is incredibly pretty though, and incredibly powerful. My favorite track by far is track 6 \\"Soeglopur\\", which vocals actually intrigued me to listen to the band, and all in all probably my favorite song by the band. Overall probably more upbeat than \\"( )\\", but not quite as good. Not enough to deserve 4 stars, but not quite as good.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I rented this movie, because I had heard a bit of buzz about the show, and was intrigued by the preview shown in the theatre.  I was in the mood for a bit of good SF.  I got more than I ever could hope for. <br /> <br />     The beginning of this movie brings everyone quickly up to speed with the Firefly universe, so even if you've never seen the series, you won't feel left behind.  The action is great, and the characters are wonderful.  After now seeing some of the series, I see that the movie pulls many of the characters in directions fans might not have expected, but it also adds depth to these characters.  Either taken on its own, or in its place in the Firefly \\"verse\\", this movie is well worth a watch. <br /> <br />     I set out to watch this movie for an hour or two of entertainment.  Instead, it made me a convert to the series.
B00000IGGA|5.0|This album is fantastic. This is the first Tom Waits album that i purchased and i had no idea what to expect. I also didnt know how different each of his albums are. I like this one because it is very old timey for him, it experiments with alot of different styles from bluesy to folky to his own unique style. From the slow \\"Black Market Baby\\" to the heartwarming \\"Hold On\\" to the insane \\"Whats He Building?\\" and all inbetween. I think the album art really capture the mood of the album, and i especially like the picture with the unbrella and the snakes. If you are into Tom Waits you should check this out. I also think his voice is incredible.
B000BMSU68|2.0|Are you thinking about buying this edition? Well, don't do it. Fortunately for you the original dvd release of this is still available and it is the one you should get. Why? Simple - it has the John Hughes commentary and THIS ONE DOESN'T. Paramount, what is your problem? Can't you do ANYTHING right? I would have picked THIS up again - if it had the commentary. Don't waste your money on this edition. Paramount can't even release an excellent film like \\"Breakdown\\" without screwing it up (on that dvd, the menu is presented anamorphically but the feature IS NOT!). Believe me, if I was running things at Paramount you'd get VALUE for your money, not WASTE like this.
0307276902|5.0|I read this book in September, 2003....after picking it up in the bargain bin for $2.99 at a local bookstore, long before Oprah, long before all the \\"it's a fraud\\" controversy.  What has stayed with me more than two years later is the way Frey was able to let the reader into his messed up mind and his broken soul, and how he backed the reader into a dark corner where Frey's anguish has no escape.  It doesn't matter how many nights he spent (or didn't spend) in jail, whether his teeth were fixed with or without novacaine, etc..... In fact, those details I've long forgotten and are truly insignificant to the message in this book.  I believe those people who rate this book 1 or 2 stars either haven't read the book or were not able to let themselves be drawn into it. Regardless of the controversy surrounding the \\"truth\\", reading this book is still a ride worth taking.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|Universal continues to frustrate. A movie I always liked and am glad to have on DVD.  Nice DVD packaging. BUT a defective DV-18 double-sided dual-layered discs on my set. This happens too often on Universal DV-18 DVD's. It's terrible holding your breath wondering if/when the disc will freeze or completely stop playing.  Universal's Quality Control is horrible. I exchange this twice at Walmart. Both copies had pixelation problems in different scenes. Another copy bought at Best Buy was fine. FWIW Buck Rogers Epic Series Disc One had a large scratch on it right out of a new sealed box. My Munsters Season One had two defective discs. Many people I know had pixelation problems on Miami Vice Season One. Universal's continued choice of using DV-18 discs is a bad one. FWIW I emailed Universal at universalstudios.com. They said they will replace the defective discs. The DVD's will supposedly be tested prior to shipping. They will send a pre-paid envelope in which to return the discs. They want just the discs not the entire set and packaging so that's fine with me if the replacements play fine. But this shouldn't even be a continuing issue with any discs. 5 stars for Dune and having it available on DVD. Zero stars for Universal continued use of poorly manufacturered DV-18.    Regarding the movie. The picture has better detail especially in the shadows than the previous non-anamorphic release. Otherwise the picture is not cleaned-up nor remastered but that honestly doesn't bother me as it retains a filmlike look. The extended version is 2.35:1 and nice to see if for no other reason than comparisons-sake with the theatrical version. Aspect-ratio aside, this seems to be most of the content of the version that was shown on TV, meaning some scenes with the Baron are not included that are in the theatrical release, such as him spitting on Jessica and killing the Harrkonnen boy after briefing Fayed & Rabban. Lynchisms like \\"put the pick in there Pete and turn it round real neat\\" aren't in this version. The deleted scenes are good to see (after my first defective disc pixelated all of them). The making-of featurettes are short but informative. I don't recall them mentioning Carlo Rambaldi the creature creator. One can always hope for more in depth bonus materials but what's here is well done.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Man this album is amazing, I was so scared because Head left but whatever Munky stepped it up and I'm so proud of him. Great Job Korn. This album is one of my favorite Korn albums and is a new direction for them and that is something they needed. I listen to it straight through most of the time and Love Song is my favorite. Great album you should get it really.
B00005NNMK|4.0|This is a great album from this era of music.  The live tracks sound surprisingly good, though I would have preferred the inclusion of a live version of \\"Rock the Night\\".  Overall though, a must have for any collector of 80's hard rock.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" heck! This wonderful adaptation and reinterpretation of the Roald Dahl fantasy novel, \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is as good as you've been told.  <br />It easily has the best production and costume design since \\"Chicago\\" and \\"The Aviator\\" a few years ago. However, the magnificent design succeeds in being better than those two films.  <br />It is also very well scripted and follows the original novel while putting a twist of its own into the film. Director Tim Burton shoots the film dramatically, creatively and all together beautifully. <br />Johnny Depp also gives a stellar and chilling performances as the Candyman himself- Willy Wonka. <br />Truly one of the best films I've seen and the best family feature in a long time!
B00000I07P|5.0|I was really into this album as a kid when I had it on cassette.  Over the years as my cd collection grew and my tastes became more diverse, a lot of my old tapes from this period got put on the back shelf.  I bought this remastered cd the other day and quickly realized I had somehow forgotten just how awesome this album really is.  It rocks from start to finish, and is one of the few where every song could have been a single.  An absolute must have.
0316172324|2.0|Blink is a book that simply proves that with years of practice and carefull analysis one can become so proficient in a particular field (or task) that after a while one becomes habituated to the point that it becomes intuative. The tennis pro, the general, the food tasters, the face psychologist, the marriage specialist, and the art historian know their field so well that it becomes second nature. They each have decades of practice and experience under their belt! So yes if you specialize by all means thin-slice but only in what you know!    Big deal! Everyone knows this feeling in say learning to type, playing the piano, or mastering a tennis serve. There is a point that one stops thinking and peaking at the keyboard and it just becomes instinctual. The coke test, the blind music audition and the racial profiling incident prove that humans are distracted by bias and cannot be trusted with instinct. After all it is universal phenomenon that attactive people are given the benefit of the doubt since their attaction often disarms all reason.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|Will Strong is about to start his first term at Sky High,a school for superheroes.  Great things are expected of Will because both of his parents are superheroes, the Commander, who is superstrong, and JetGirl, who flies (their cover is selling real estate, they get almost as excited about selling a house as about saving the world).  Unfortunatley, Will has no superpowers as yet, though he is too embarrased to tell anyone. <br /> <br />When he gets to the school he finds that everyone has to demonstrate their powers to the Coach, who then decides whether they will take the Superhero course, or the Sidekick one.  Having no powers at all, Will ends up in the Sidekick course, as does his best friend, a very pretty girl with an amzing power which she refuses to demonstrate because she despises the superhero/sidekick division.  Will also runs into trouble with the school badboy, whose father was put in jail by Will's father, and who therefore has a grudge against Will. <br /> <br />When Will's superpowers eventually kick in (during a fight with the badboy), he is promoted out of the sidekick class and starts dating the glamorous school president.  His best friend is not happy about this as she has a crush on will (of course he hasn't noticed).  When danger threatens Sky High, it is of course the despised sidekicks who turn out to have just the powers that are needed to save the day, along with Will and the badboy who have to settle their differences and cooperate. <br /> <br />This is a film that everyone should enjoy.  Kids will love the exciting story and spectacular special effects, and there is plenty of humour that will appeal to adults.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have to say, I absolutely adored this movie. When I first saw the cover, it didn't seem very interesting, especially with my grandmother's vague description of it as, \\"Two places that don't understand each other.\\" But was I ever in for a surprise! After seeing the first episode I was totally hooked. The beautifully romantic story, mixed with a fastinating cause, was irresistible.  <br /> <br />It tells the story of Margaret Hale, a young woman whose father uproots her and her mother from their gorgeous, comfortable house in the south, to Milton, an industrial northern town. Margaret is shocked by the poverty and brutality of this place. After she sees a cottonmill owner, Mr Thornton, beating up one of his workers, she lays a hatred on the handsome, though brooding, man. Over time, however, after aiding mill-workers in their strike, she begins to accept Milton and even Mr Thornton, to a degree. Will she be ready, however, when Mr Thornton confesses...love? <br /> <br />This movie is absolutly brilliant. The acting is superb and the ending is unforgetably romantic, as other reviewers have already mentioned. By the end I was sobbing. It is amazing. Now I have to go see it again.
0553382179|4.0|I haven't yet read the book, but have been using the website and emailing system for a little while now.  I found the website by happy chance, and although I agree with many that the tone is often a little over-sweet, the intention to help people regain their self-esteem and learn to like, or better still love, themselves is admirable. <br /> <br />The Shining Sink concept is often ridiculed, but this is in effect a benchmark for the remainder of the house; the sink starts it off, and the rest follows in order to keep up!  In my case, each room has ended up with it's own version of the Shining Sink, and acts as a spur to make the rest of the room follow suit, bit by baby bit.  It DOES sound soppy, but it works.  I no longer feel I am drowning in CHAOS. <br /> <br />I was always organised at work, but the house got sloppy, dirty, and crammed full of clutter and junk that \\"might come in useful one day\\" or that I felt too tired to deal with.  The idea that it could be dispensed with and organised in small steps, and didn't require a marathon effort, is no doubt obvious to some, but it wasn't to me.  I am slowly regaining control, and my unwanted house guest, Mr Clutterbug, is gradually losing his grip on our home.  I have decided he has definitely outstayed his welcome, and that is thanks to the FlyLady and her team.  Good luck to them.
B00008PX8P|5.0|The DVD is a work of art. All the visuals and footage is fantastic. The sound is great and is some of the best Led Zeppelin you could listen to. <br /> <br />It is true that they show Jimmy Page a lot, but they also show Robert Plant plenty as well as John Bonham. John Paul Jones isn't showed as much, but he is the bass player and they seem to be forgotten about. <br /> <br />How the sound is mastered on \\"Moby Dick\\" and the footage provided, it shows that Bonham was a gifted and outstanding drummer.  <br /> <br />Before I bought and watched this DVD I couldn't decide who was the best out of Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Jimmy Page, but now after seeing Page perform and what he is capable of; Jimmy Page is definitely one of the greatest if not the greatest guitar players ever.  <br /> <br />Something that I found to enjoy about the DVD is how much each of the members in the band got into the music. They could have easily just gone up and played, but instead they were feeling the music and reacting. Led Zeppelin is a band of performers and it truly adds to the richness of the music.  <br /> <br />This DVD is an unbelievable stash of recordings from an outstanding band.
B00005QEO1|5.0|One of my favrite Aersomith albums is Pump. It has some of their great classics on it like Young Lust, the fast yet somewhat jazzy Janie's Got A Gun, What It Takes, and my favorite Aerosmith song, The Other Side! It was a breath of fresh air from all the mediocre albums they put out in the 80's, and it may be more poppy than Toys or their debut, but it's still worth a listen. That goes for Permanent Vacation too. So run away from the pain and pick up Pump! The Other Side is worth the whole album!
B000C65Z1G|5.0|If John le Carre' wrote in any other genre than spy thriller, he would be considered one of our greatest authors. le Carre' is a hypnotic storyteller and although he spins tales of intrigue, more often than not his characters are also swept into complex moral and spiritual journeys. Such is the case here.<br /><br />Only after her death does Justin Quayle, Ralph Fiennes, set out to discover his wife's real character; in the process, he learns a lot more than that. Fiennes is truly brilliant, always understated, always controlled, smoldering beneath a veneer of English civility. For an even closer look at his acting genius, try Spider, directed by David Cronenberg, an unsettling tour de force.<br /><br />Much has been said about Rachel Weisz who plays his wife. Her performance is indeed vivid and credible, even if her character, Tessa, is a bit simplistic and myopic. Those who perceive this film as a left-wing diatribe against the big mean pharma companies are totally missing the point. Art can never be propaganda and vice versa. Bear in mind that the cold war is over and le Carre' must find new villains. He has found a very nasty one indeed. But third-world exploitation is merely the story's canvas, not its point.<br /><br />Which brings us to director Fernando Meirelles, whose City of God electrified the screen with its portrayal of teenage gang life in Rio's slums. Meirelles has an astounding eye and ability to put viewers in a place. His work here is extraordinary; this is not the Africa of lion-country-safari. This is the real Africa, with beauty and squalor and color and desolation all shoulder to shoulder.<br /><br />The only possible criticism I would offer is the pacing, The Constant Gardener seems to move as quickly as a plant grows. But with so many other virtues, one can overlook its lack of sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat tension. Maybe it's better to sit back in your seat, and watch the tension blossom gradually.
B000002N2P|5.0|I'm a HUGE fan of Green Day, and I think that even today they are still a great band(Yes, you heard me, I LIKE the American Idiot album); but this album would have to be my favorite. It  was their most \\"punk\\" album, and it was extremely agressive. Insomniac was also their darkest album with some of their angriest lyrics. It's not hard to understand why Insomniac is so underrated. It was released in 1995, just a year after Dookie came out, and Dookie was still pretty hot. Still, it has managed to sell 2million copies in the U.S., so it's definately has gained credibility over the years.<br /><br /> Bab's Uvula Who? is the most popular track off the album, and deservedly so. Brain Stew is a song about insomnia. Billie Joe wrote it when he couldn't sleep because his 1-year-old son would cry all night(Good thing too, otherwise they never would've made this great album!). Stuart And The Ave. is my personal favorite, it's highly underrated, but I could care less. It's my favorite Insomniac song partly because it has some pretty good bass work behind it. Being a bassist myself, I can't help but love it. And other than that, it's just damn catchy!<br /><br />Billie Joe's trademark sneer really get's to shine in this album; so pick up Insomniac! It's fun, agressive, dark, and has songs that we can all relate to(believe it or not)!
B000AARKOO|2.0|The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because Orlando Bloom and Liam Neeson (sp?) are good actors.  It's the story that sucks.  Maybe the story is true, maybe it's been embellished ...  I wouldn't know because I'm no historian.  But I do know that I could barely keep my eyes open.  It was torture to watch it.  I finally gave up after an hour.
0679422714|5.0|Historically, it has always been a problem for communists to accept the Freudian message that all of us, irrespective of greatness, have a dark side to our character. Because of this reluctance, Marx, Engels, Lenin and Mao have all been shown to be 'pure' in a way that smacks of communism being a religious cult.<br /><br />Irrespective of the validity of the anonymous sources and KGB archives used by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday  in this book, the following points seem to be a fact of life:<br /><br />1. That Mao was primarily responsible for the disaster of the Great Leap forward and that he hardly showed any remorse for the death of 20-30 million Chinese as a result of his policies. There is no record of him apologising to the Chinese people even privately thru his confidants.<br /><br />2. That he unleashed the cultural revolution primarily for the preservation of his power in the face of rising opposition within the party to his policies. Again, the consequence of millions of lives being uprooted and lost was just a 'collateral' damage for him, for which he showed no remorse.<br /><br />3. That Mao was basically authoritarian and undemocratic in his outlook and ruled as a dictator. There is no point in pointing to 'the hundred flowers' movement and talk of democratic centralism in support of Mao. Whenever his colleagues Liu Shao Chi or Peng de Huai tried to invoke the democratic principle in policy making, Mao's response seems to be to brand his opponents as 'counter-revolutionaries', which is a classic communist response promoted by Lenin and Stalin.<br /><br />4.Even though there are many western and eastern scholars who contest Jung Chang's thesis and come to the defence of Mao, there is something that Jung Chang possesses which none of her detractors do. As shown in her book 'Wild Swans', Jung Chang lived in China through the cultural revolution and also personally experienced the travails and hardships of her parents , who were good communists. Such personal experience must be accorded higher value in evaluating her work than comparing it with the work of academicians sitting in their offices in London and New York.<br /><br />5. Even if her debunking of the crossing of the river Dadu and other similar communist accomplishments do not stand scrutiny, the above points are sufficient to seriously doubt the 'greatness' of Chairman Mao.<br /><br />This book is a must read for all good communists.e accorded higher value in evaluating her work than comparing it with the work of academicians sitting in their offices in London and New York. <br />5.

B00006RCOB|5.0|I loved it the first time I saw it in the 1980s but I liked it more when I watched it with my fiancee'!  Classic good v. evil USA v. Soviet combination of high-flying action and spy-thriller suspense.  An effective film depicting the dangers of human intel efforts as well as the passion for freedom that drives people to risk everything to obtain it for themselves or others. Clint is great as usual, as are all the supporting actors. Very entertaining.
B000000W5H|5.0|This is Mick Taylor's last album and he provides exquisite lead guitar on \\"Time Waits for No One\\".  When played on the radio the choice from this album is usually \\"It's Only Rock n' Roll (But I like it)\\", but there are far more interesting songs on the album, \\"Til the Next Time We Say Goodbye\\" (reminiscent of the earlier more personal Jagger back when they were more English than American), the funky, jazzy \\"Fingerprint File\\", the richly textured reggae-influenced rhythm guitar of \\"Luxury\\", all of the songs are good.  \\"Short and Curlies\\" is kind of rollicking interlude that would have fit right in on \\"Exile on Main Street\\".  \\"If You Really Want to Be My Friend\\" is a more serious version of the \\"Angie\\" sentiment.  There is a strong, very Temptations-like but nevertheless all Stones version of \\"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\\".  \\"Dance Little Sister\\" and \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\" are strong traditional heavy rockers, with heavy Bill Wyman bass lines. There is an interesting mix of styles and moods, very clean but very clever variations on the production, with the expected and undeniable instrumental and vocal brilliance.
B000AY74OG|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies I have seen.  As a mother of three, I have seen many animated movies, but this one was wonderful.  The children really enjoyed the story, and it was very funny.  My children watched it every day for a week, and are now watching it once a week.  I still enjoy it every time.  I can put this movie in and it's as if they are watching this for the first time.  I would anticipate a sequel, but not sure of a story line. <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie to children and adults.
1558908382|4.0|This isn't your average John Cusack romantic comedy. He plays a hit man here who is going to his 10th high school reunion. The humor is dark and the action scenes are done tongue in cheek. <br />John Cusack is good as is his sister Joan and love interest Minnie Driver. Dan Aykroyd is underused in his part of a competing contract killer. A nice bonus is that Driver plays a DJ and there are wall to wall 80's songs of all stripes in the movie. The cheery music is contrasted to the cold killings of Cusack.  <br />This movie is not for everyone but if you like dark irreverent humor, you'll enjoy this one.
0345479092|4.0|I thought this book had some good points.  ppl should see this book as advice and not follow things so literally.  I noticed many reviews, ppl did not agree with her about breastfeeding.  I notice that she tries not to pressure moms into breastfeeding.  After my baby was born, I felt pressured to breastfeed.

I especially appreciate that recipes note how long items will keep once baked.  I wish more cookbooks would include that info since I like to know how long I can expect to keep the food! <br /> <br />Overall, this is a thorough book with MANY recipes and truly beautiful (and useful) pictures.
0380820846|5.0|The story of Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton is a delightful one. I liked the fact that Penelope is different from most heroines and Colin is a wonderful hero. The lack of love scenes was not even noticed by me until I read some of the reviews here. Colin and Penelope's relationship develops through actions and dialogue in such a way that the reader can understand why these two are made for each other. I'll take Quinn's masterful dialogue over thrown in love scenes any day. In a lot of romances, authors make the mistake of replacing deep and meaningful conversation with love scenes to explain why the hero and heroine are in love. This story is funny and enjoyable and the reader is not left wondering whether or not the two main characters are in love or lust. It is obvious Penelope and Colin are head over heels in love!
0783226845|5.0|Now and then it is refreshing to turn back time and elect to watch older films of substance, a reminder that there are certain cinematic characters that have become indelible.  SCENT OF A WOMAN provided Al Pacino a stage on which to perform a true character, unlike any he had played before, and make it one of those creations that still, 15 years later, evoke a smile and  applause.<br /><br />Blind, acerbic, loudmouthed, irascible Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Pacino) hires preppy, in need of money, Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) to escort him to New York for a 'final fling'.  Charlie has his own issues that depress him, but the two end up having such a grand time in New York that they bond strongly - until Slade dresses for his final moment.  The tearful Charlie convinces Slade not to off himself, Charlie's innate character wins Slade's gruff heart, and Slade ends up defending Charlie in an inforgettable prep school 'mock trial'.<br /><br />The complete manner in which Pacino inhabits this role is a stroke of studied genius: as a blind man his every physical and verbal movements are wholly convincing.  There are many fine moments in this film, not the least of which is the famous Tango scene, or the confrontation between Charlie and Slade regarding a suicide plan.  Pacino won Best Actor for his role and it is richly deserved. This is a film to cherish.  Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, February 06

B0068FZ0YM|5.0|Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain' (2005) is certainly a film about a passionate love relationship between two men, but it's equally about loneliness, isolation, lack of self-acceptance, fear, betrayal, the inability to communicate effectively, and the destructive results of broad but deeply ingrained social prejudices.<br /><br />As such, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a film of enormous universal appeal, which no doubt explains why the film is profoundly touching diverse audiences everywhere. Most people, regardless of orientation or background, have experienced some or all of these difficult elements in their own lives.<br /><br />Though not technically perfect, the film actually achieves much more than being a mere exercise in cinematic polish: it is genuinely moving, deeply compassionate, poignant, tender, gripping, and superbly intelligent. 'Brokeback Mountain' is about two men who fall in love with one another in the early 1960s--two people--two human beings. It tells its sometimes unpleasant story in three vibrant dimensions, and, in doing so, casts a soul and a shadow across the screen.<br /><br />'Brokeback Mountain' in also incredibly nuanced in every manner possible--there are more than dozen scenes, both major and minor, which can be broadly interpreted; at least one pivotal scene remains almost entirely open to audience interpretation.<br /><br />The film also gains from repeated viewings, as scene after scene seem to take on new dimensions and meanings.<br /><br />What does the slaughtered sheep Ennis discovers after his initial intimate encounter with Jack symbolize? What else might the sheep's mutilated carcass remind him of? Is Ennis, semi-consciously or unconsciously, planting an idea in Jack's mind when he says he's &#34;had no chance to sin&#34;?<br /><br />Why does Ennis lose control of himself while he and Jack are play-wrestling? Why does Lee choose to frame Ennis against a night sky of exploding fireworks during a Fourth of July celebration? Does Jack's mother invite Ennis up to view Jack's room with a special goal in mind? Why does she nod subtly when Ennis returns to the central room, and have a paper bag waiting for him nearby?<br /><br />Why does Ennis change his mind about attending a pivotal event in his daughter's life in the film's last scene?<br /><br />Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest and most understated performances ever presented in an American film. Note how Ledger doesn't require any dialogue to express Ennis' deeply conflicted, gravely isolated psyche: he conveys it through the manner in which Ennis walks, mumbles, hangs his head, and, in one grim scene, forks his way listlessly through a slice of apple pie in what appears to be an off-hour bus depot.<br /><br />The manner in which Ennis and Jack express their passion for one another is incredibly moving, since their attraction is primarily an expression of emotional desire and deep longing rather than a matter of strictly physical attraction.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal does his best work in the film when illustrating Jack's tenderness for Ennis in three key scenes: on the occasion of their second intimate encounter, on the afternoon they leave the mountain, and during their last meeting; and tenderness expressed between men is a thing rarely seen in American cinema. Additionally, adult love has seldomly been depicted in film as convincingly as it is in 'Brokeback Mountain.'<br /><br />It's probable that the film's brief last line, hauntingly delivered by Ledger, will go down in film history, since it allows Ennis to finally express, as best he is able, everything he has felt for Jack over several decades in three terse, surging, terribly sad words.<br /><br />With the exception of children, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a film for all audiences. It's a grand thing to actually discover a mature, intelligent film that is 'adult' in the best sense of the word, which is also profound and highly enjoyable. 'Brokeback Mountain' has proven to have a kind of healing power over its many of its viewers, and thus is a film all audiences potentially gain from seeing.d of healing power over its many of its viewers, and thus is a film all audiences potentially gain from seeing.
0679457313|3.0|. . .that this book is terribly popular, beloved by many.<br /><br />I can't say that I completely understand why.  I found the writing to be a little precious, the \\"literary-ness\\" of it a little forced.<br /><br />Even though I sympathize with the anti-caste position Roy takes, I felt a little bashed over the head by it.<br /><br />Having said that, her descriptions are lush and apt.  The steamy, tropical, educated, unique Keralan culture is truly described, which is a pleasure to read.<br /><br />I hope someone brilliant--Deepa Mehta?--makes a film of The God of Small Things.  I think it would be amazing visually.
0684824906|5.0|As a person new to these shores my understanding of American history was fairly scant, now I begin to understand the reverence for Lincoln.The first time I became aware of Doris Kearns-Goodwin was on \\"American experience\\" talking about baseball and keeping box scores and the use of them to bring a game to life after the fact. Well with this book she certainly gave life to Lincoln for me. I now realize what great man and leader he was and I shall look to his wisdom for answers in the political world of today which has few real leaders, little courage of conviction and almost no wisdom. I appreciate the many years of work that have gone into this book and I will repay that effort by rereading it over many years.
B0002OERI0|5.0|It took me a while to warm up to AI.  My 12 year old son was enthralled by it, and, on some car trips to go skiing, at his request I played the CD, end to end, several times.  I really was blown away by the thematic continuity, incisive lyrics, and bold, exciting and thoroughly enjoyable music from the first track to the last.  A work of genius, if ever a one there was! <br /> <br />Warning: Listening to Green Day while driving may endanger one's driver's license.
1401307450|3.0|While I'm only a fan of fewer than 2 of RHCP's funkadelic rock things, I am always interested in reading about the highs and lows of top entertainment people and their experiences in this otherwordly-industry. Mr. Kiedis leaves no chance overlooked to suggest the greatness of his writing (with a little help from \\" \\" apparently), which is in all honesty, but ho-hum. The book sags in places for me because I'm rather indifferent to the details and nitty-gritty of anyone's childhood, including children smoking weed by age 12. In addition, Mr. Kiedis somehow felt he owed it to a handful of the women in his life to pen down odes to their numerous relationships together and these left me entirely indifferent as well. The book picks up considerably though once RHCP's take off and Mr. Kiedis takes us through the ups and downs of his addiction. Even the compulsive repetitiveness of his many, many relapses (there are... MANY) seems to serve as a cautionary tale of the power that drugs hold over people. In this respect, I felt more resonance in SCAR TISSUE than I ever did from the vastly overhyped James Frey trainwreck-of-a-book. I did expect a great deal more on the saga of the band and found the book somewhat wanting in that respect. Certainly 20-30 pages of girlfriend trauma could have been substituted by digging more into the tales of the band, but oh well. All in all an adequate enough effort.

B00005ASHM|4.0|PET SOUNDS is without a doubt a wonderful collection of beautiful harmonies and melodies. Each song is an incredibly well-crafted set piece, individual masterpieces when heard separately. The problem is when they are put together in this package, there is a sameness to the songs. Found in the heart of each song is a gentle, haunting melody without an edge. The songs move seamlessly from one to another and this actually works to their disadvantage; they just are not different enough from each other to be fully appreciated in this setting. Unlike SMILE, where Wilson is able to constantly surprise and amaze, PET SOUNDS is a pleasent and sweet series of songs, I enjoy them but they create a sense of comfort rather than amazement.
B00005NB8K|5.0|The particular filmography of Oliver Stone has had peak and lows. He is - before any other circumstance - a CSI filmmaker. His camera is an untiring explorer of facts, livings and memories. That is why my personal list of his treasures films possibly do not include his most succesful works.<br /><br />This is one of my three favorite Opus of Stone; (my other tweo choice are JFK and Wall Street). This movie works out as historical document, due its shocking realism but the the loyal refelect of USA in those ages. Being an exception figure O.S. innquires and carves in releief the expectations, defeats and livings of whole generation, tired of waiting who felt Jim Morrison was the icon of his generation, the direct descendent of the beatnik ages headed by Alan Gingsberg and Andy Warhol. The script is so well built and the performances are so natural and spontaneous; the towering acting of Kilmer and the fabulous scenaries conform a majuscule and interweaved puzzle of multidimensional resonance.<br /><br />Recommended without reserves.
1559211407|4.0|This is a one-of-a-kind work which will appeal to those who love books and literature.  It also provides the guilty pleasure of reading someone else's mail!  Not one of the letters included is distinguished in its own right--some are crushingly commercial.  But as a chronological collection, they show us an increasing friendship between two lovers of fine old volumes.  It is a friendship no less real because of its prosaic beginnings.  Indeed, knowing that the two principals were never able to meet makes it that much rarer.  Ms.  Hanff shares much of herself in this work, to an extent few authors are willing to match. <br /> <br />The stratagem of the book would fail if it were 400 pages.  This is best appreciated in a single sitting, and it is short enough that one can easily make time to read it in that manner, even in a busier time than this book portrays.
0553381709|4.0|When it comes to the world of literature, I am obsessed with one thing in particular: characters. A story with characters that are not interesting enough for me is not a story. A Song of Ice and Fire (as I believe this series is called) is a good story.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the characters in the story being racist, sexist, cruel, foul-mouthed etc. That's what people are, in general. This story was inspired by the Hundred Years War and the War of the Roses (or so I've heard) and instead of taking a few modern-minded characters who fight for women's rights, equality, freedom and the `American Way', Martin created characters typical of that time. I found them believable. I could truly see people back then acting the way they do in this story. And out of all the main characters (there are about ten), about half of them are women! And all of them strong, independent (except Sansa, but in a nice way) women, too.<br /><br />Catelyn is a very powerful female figure who knows and accepts her place as a woman (though she rebels inwardly) and proves to be level-headed, wise and loving. Daenarys (one of my favorite characters) goes from being a small, weak sort of girl to a struggling queen, without becoming a nasty b****. Most writers have this conception that a woman has to be loud and hot-tempered in order to be considered `strong'. I kind of hate Arya, so I won't talk much about her, besides that she's is a tough tomboy. And Sansa, perhaps my favorite, is a sweet, romantic girl who is docile but by no means weak. Brienne isn't a main-main character, but she is an odd and literally powerful female figure.<br /><br />As for the male characters, a lot of people complain about Tyrion (another favorite character of mine) but I don't see what they have against him. I saw nothing unbelievable about his war efforts and, in real life, stranger things have happened. Like Tyrion says, he is guilty-for  being a dwarf. I love his character because it presents the Lannisters in a better light; as people, not as cold-blooded bad guys. If not for anything else, buy this book for Jon (another favorite...gee, I guess they're all my favorites) and his defence of the Wall, with only a handful of men to hold it. Best part of the book!! Ended exactly the way I wanted it too.<br /><br />This book remains as one of the few in which I do not completely despise a single character. I usually hate most female characters (despite being myself a girl) because they're so mean and snobbish, but in this book all the characters have my approval.<br /><br />And of course, Ser Jaime is now an official character, with his name in big black letters for chapters starring him, in all his glory. Hooray! My heart stopped when I saw his name there...How I could possibly like a man who would fling a boy from a window is beyond me, but I have a soft spot in my heart for pretty men. =^-^= Anyway, he does not disappoint, and I was so thrilled that I just ate up all the chapters he was in...and now my books missing pages. Martin shouldn't make such yummy, naughty men...In any case, he does get what's coming to him, to satisfy you Jaime-haters, and I totally hope he hooks up with Brienne (read the book, don't ask). Satin is a new favorite character of mine; I only hope Martin brings him a bit more into the story. I also like the Sandor Clegane (the Hound) pairing with Arya, but that apparently ends. Too bad.<br /><br />Other people have complained about the way a lot of characters die. Despite the loss of characters I like, this is a good thing as it creates an air of suspense non-existent in any other fantasy novel ever written. I mean, come on, did you ever truly doubt that Frodo would survive? Or that Harry Potter would be triumphant? Or even that Luke Skywalker would be able to defeat Darth Vader? (Ok,ok, so it's a movie, not a book) Of course not. But in this book, no one's safe.<br /><br />There are also no good guys nor badguys. All the characters havegood sides and bad sides. Even the tale of incest has a good side to it; Jaime is hopelessly in love with Cersei and has never been with another woman. The author is not obviously rooting for one side. Anyone may win, all of them perhaps even deserve to win. Characters are constantly being given new sides to their<br /><br />Another complaint is plot, but I am a character-driven critic. All I care about is characters. That said, I love the way the book is set up, even though I usually don't like books that constantly switch between characters (like Artemis Fowl).<br /><br />Finally, the bad stuff.<br /><br />Well, the people are foul-mouthed. Really, really foul-mouthed. Bad words abound. I normally don't mind it so much, but it's kind of excessive. It is necessary to some extent; to delineate character types, for example. The sweet Sansa contrasts quite sharply with the Hound (another of my favorite character...he's such an interesting fellow...no accounting for tastes, right?) mainly due to their respective use of language and profanity. Everyone knows all the bad words anyway, so why is it so shocking to see them in print? Either way, it could be cut down and not hurt anything.<br /><br />And then there's the sexual content. Now I don't mind a girl getting married at thirteen because they used to marry early back then. It's not anathema for a young girl to marry-I mean, does it really matter if they waited till she was sixteen? As for the guy she got married to, if you continue to read the story, he turns out to be a great guy, maybe not gentle, maybe barbaric and maybe even cruel when it comes to his enemies, but as Daenarys says in this book, \\"He made me his queen.\\" Only he killed poor Viserys (you guessed it; another pet favorite of mine; I'm a sucker for the beautiful and cruel).<br /><br />And then you have the incest. Now, isn't it just sad that people are not offended by Lollys being raped half a hundred times, and thousands of people reportedly being tortured and murdered, but one mention of incest has them enraged? Incest is yet another fact of life, whether you find it disgusting or not, and even in Shakespeare's time it was a subject openly mentioned. They have plays written on the subject! (There is a beautiful speech ending `Kiss me again, forgive me,\\" that is so beautiful and tragic.)<br /><br />Finally, the sexual material. I feel very strongly about this. This book should come shrink-wrapped and be x-rated, 18+. As one who has read romance novels before, I'm no stranger to steamy love scenes. But Martin, though he describes little enough, is very graphic and disturbing in his imagery. However, there aren't that many of such scenes, but there needn't be any. It is this point and this alone which made me give Martin 4 stars instead of five. He shouldn't lower himself to porn for thrill value.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a must-read! Black out the bad passages if you must.a good side to it; Jaime is hopelessly in love with Cersei and has never been with another woman. The author is not obviously rooting for one side.

B0000C6E4D|4.0|This CD is yet another example of Sarah McLachlan's musical talent and abilities.  She seems to get better as she goes along.  Some of the highlights include:    \\"Fallen\\" : This is the one you probably hear on the radio, and there's a reason for that.  A great song, and typical Sarah.    \\"Answer\\" : This is a very quiet, slow song, so you have to listen closely.  But it's very touching, and she delivers it in a very heartfelt manner.    \\"Stupid\\" : My favorite song on the CD.  She asks herself \\"How stupid could I be?  A simpleton could see that you're no good for me.  But you're the only one I see.\\"  There's not many of us who haven't felt an emotion similar to that at one point in our lives.  We know a person might not be the best thing for us, but other emotions overtake us and make us ignore that.

B00008DDSC|5.0|This is a warm story that paints a very human face on BDSM relationship and gives a long overdo pro-sub portrayal of a woman who fundamentally feels fulfilled and the strongest only when she is submitting. <br /> <br />Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a stellar performance as a submissive woman who is seeking a genuine relationship with a man who is emotional unavailable--but eventually wins his heart. <br /> <br />Gyllenhaal gives a powerful perfomance of the inherent strength and beauty in the submissive woman.  Far from being a doormat, Gyllenhaal knows what she wants and won't settle for the man that she is not in love with and who cannot fulfill her sexually, pyschologically, or emotionally. <br /> <br />Sex, smart, and heart warming, The Secretary will make you rethink what BDSM is and perhaps make you want to spank the white off the ass of the woman in your life--with love of course. ;) <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000844MR|1.0|Believe it or not, I never actually saw this movie until I bought it on Monday, despite my love of Labyrinth, all things dark and/or unconventional, and an extreme fascination with Brian Froud. <br />That said, even I found this movie creepy in parts.  I think if I had seen it as a kid, it would have scared the bejesus out of me, so I DO NOT recommend this for young kids, even though the little beasts are awfully jaded these days. <br />I actually still fell in love with the rather, shall we say, nonhuman characters.  My best friend was a rat, may she rest in peace, so I was delighted with all the little bug-eyed, fuzzy critters, like Fizzgig.   <br />The story is typical for most eighties fantasy genre movies, in that a great quest is undertaken to save the (Other)world, by a naive and unsure hero, in this case a Gelfling named Jen, who meets his female counterpart in Kira.  I won't say any more about the storyline, because if you have not seen this and I talk about Skekses, Mystics, and Podlings, you'll only be like WTF is she talking about, which is what I thought before buying this DVD. <br />Don't forget, the Superbit Collection has superior picture quality, especially when you are talking about an already beautiful movie like this one or Labyrinth, but you won't get any extras on these editions.  Actually perfect for those of us who never get around to watching them anyway!
B000002TWN|5.0|I came across this album back in July 1995.  I bought it from Tower Records in Berkley Ca.  When I bought it, Neo-Soul was pretty much unherd of.  I can remember hearing the first 5 songs and telling a man that worked in the store to give me a copy.  They were playing it on the stores system because they were previewing it, it was the release day.   It was so different at the time most people didnt know what to make of it.  Most people couldnt get past the track S#!t, DaNm, MF.  My wife, who was my girlfriend at the time told me it was garbage and didnt know why I was listening to it.  Her opinion didnt mean much to me because her favorite artist was Kieth Sweat and Soul4 real.  Needless to say, she dosnt have much music credability.  But as as soon as I bought it, I knew that I had a CD that was going to change R&B and change it real soon.  But I thought it would take longer than it did because the album wasnt recieved well until \\"Your My Lady\\" got a Buzz and a video.  Thats when people started taking notice.  I think that it is considered a good album by most and is a masterpiece to people who know music and those who think they know music.  But this is hands down one of the top ten best all around albums EVER recorded. <br />
1932907009|5.0|Most screenwriting books are geared towards beginners, but Save The Cat! would not only be fantastic for beginners but also screenwriters at any level. When someone first suggested I read it I was actually dreading it, thinking it would be another lecturing book full of things I already knew. I was amazed at how informative and how FUN it was to read this book (which I did in less than two hours, couldn't put it down). For the first time I actually laughed out loud while reading a book on screenwriting, and learned at the same time! <br /> <br />I would reccomend this to any screenwriter or aspiring screenwriter. Regardless of how many screenwriting books you have read, you haven't gained half the understanding as you will reading this one book. If you can only afford one screenwriting book, make it this one!
0307276902|1.0|I used to think that Native Son was the worst book I'd ever read. That was before I picked up A Million Little Pieces (no pun intended).  I have no words for this novel. The grammar is horrific, my 8 year old nephew has better sentence structure, and I'd be willing to bet that 20% of the book consists of Frey's repetitive phrases (\\"I was sad. I was sad. I was sad,\\" or \\"I cried. I cried. I cried,\\" etc.). It became a chore to get through this book, an experience I've only had once or twice in my lifetime as I can appreciate almost any story in some way. I thank God that I only borrowed this from the library and I didn't actually waste any money on it. Even moreso now that I know the author is a fraud.    Save yourself some time and sweep A Million Little Pieces out with the garbage.
B000031WD9|4.0|Four friends Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) all make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night.  Oz joins a choir in hopes to meet a nice young girl, and he does; a girl named Heather (Mena Suvari).  They both hit it off.  Kevin wants to show his girlfriend Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum (Tara Reid) he really cares about her and wants to have sex, but neither one are prepared.  Prom night comes, and three out of the four guys agree to back off from their pact.  They feel that they are pressured to have sex before the night is over.   <br /> <br />A very funny film, that shows the sexually active young men at their prime. Also starring Jennifer Coolidge as Steve Stifler's (Seann William Scott) mom, and Eugene Levy as Jim's dad.  Finch and Stifler's mom are just hilarious together. <br />
B00009W8N2|5.0|If you are one of the opeth fans who hate screaming than this one might not be for you. They have definantly evolved over the years since making this one. I on the other hand love the distorted vocals as well as his singing voice. I think that the style of screaming on this cd is better than the type on there later cds. However if you can get past the screaming This is a masterpiece. Making masterieces is nothing new for opeth. It seems like they cant pick up the guitar without making a genious riff. The accoustic sections are also shorter but no less brilliant.  The song Forrest in October is so awsome that it is quite possible it might end up being my favorite song of all time. That is if it stands up to the test of time. As with all opeth that I have everytime I listen to them they get better. Some thisngs that are obviously different here are mikaels clean vocals are not as refined as later cd's. For the most part the accoustic breakdowns are shorter, and less frequent than in later albums. The melodies themselves dont feel as progressive. To me they sound more like the melodies of norwegian folk metal. Having said that they are still great. And obviously the production is not as clean as later cd's. This might bother some people. I on the other hand listen to mostly black metal, so I have an appreciation for underproduced sounds. It gives this cd more of a underground metal feel, which they were at the time.  In Mist She Was Standing 9 Opens with the usual steller Opeth riffs. They deliver the first solo about three minutes in. At about the 5:30 mark the first accoustic breakdown eases in. Man is it beautiful. Underneath it a soft serene electric guitar glides to and fro hyptnotizing the listener into a state of bliss. That is my favorite part of this song. After that the usual series of riffs, solo's and accoustics go by.  Under the Weeping Moon 10 This is probably my third favorite song on this cd. At about 3 minutes in the first accoustic breakdown starts. It is very similar to that of the first song except this one has a darker tone. While the first song had more of a serene feel. There are also some strange fluttering sounds that help to dramatize the aptmosphere. All in all this is an excellent song with many memorable parts.  Silhouette 9 A piano instrumental by Anders Nordin the drummer. It is an exquisite piece that winds through my soul everytime I hear it. Somewhat somber, yet beautiful. Its kind of a tease because it would be nice if they would have used this type of stuff more often. Perhaps even mixing it with the accoustics and riffs during the songs. Than again who the hell am I to interfere with the minds of these geniuses.  Forest of October 20/10 This is not only the highlight of the cd, but I think it is the highlight of opeths entire career. Definantly in my top 10 metal songs of all time. I could write an entire page describing in detail each and every riff, solo and melody here. The opening riff is slow and full of emotion. My favorite part of this opus is at 4:50 all the way to the end. It is filled with some of the best riffs, solo's, melodies and even some psychadelia.  Twilight Is My Robe 10 This one opens and closes with godly riffs and melodic guitar. However the heart and soul of this song is the long accoustic section, that has some of Mikael's best singing on this cd. His vocals were'nt as refined this early in opeths career. They are still great and add a soothing feel to this otherwise metal album. His voice is more of a soft low humming compared to the heavenly vocals he would aquire in later releases.  Requiem 6 This low rating in no way cuts down this track. It is some really good accoustic strumming. My problem is that it is rather short, and should have been added to a existing song rather than given its own track.  Apostle in Triumph 10 Picks up where the last one left off. A pretty good accoustic intro. Than there is a lull before the song picks up again. This is probably my secondfavorite song on here. At 7:25 there is some strange sounding istrument that is really good and gives this song a strange medieval aura. My only complaint with opeth is that I wish they would do more experimenting with different instruments like this. Another example is the celtic sounding melody that appears briefly in \\"Black Rose Immortal\\".  Bonus Track Into the Frost of Winter 8 Awsome early opeth. Only listen to this if you appreciate pure cold, grimm, brutality.  Anyways this is an awsome cd that you have to get if you are a fan. Some may just look at this as the cd opeth got their start with. Now I agree that opeth has become more complex over time, yet this one will always hold a special place with me.
B000005AYM|4.0|This CD is truly a classic and one of my all-time favorites. Love it!
B00005A1PR|5.0|One of my favorite CDs ever. When I want to feel good and get grounded, I play this. This is authentic, real, soulful music from a truly gifted artist. I love you, India!
B000002MTU|4.0|If memory serves me correctly, I ordered this CD in its pre-release phase from Amazon.com.  I was really excited when it came in the mail and had to bring it in to work to listen to it, because I had yet to get my first CD player.<br /><br />Those at work who already liked Clapton simply loved this CD.<br /><br />For those who lacked appreciation for Clapton before then were ambivalent about it.<br /><br />I was betwixt and between.<br /><br />Honestly, I expected more.<br /><br />Technically, it's pure blues and much of it is in the Chicago style.  Clapton showed he was a great student of the genre, but I went, \\"Is this it?\\"<br /><br />Yet over the years it is among my favorite of Clapton's music.  It has grown on me.  Maybe I've grown.<br /><br />Listen to some sample tracks here and see what you think.<br /><br />I play this album on my Internet-only radio station called Pensacola Live 365.<br /><br />All best.<br /><br />-Lee
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Beautiful to behold, and an enjoyable diversion from the world of W...but still does not measure up to the BBC/A&E production with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. They are the perfect Darcy and Elizabeth.
B000000YG5|5.0|Yes, what you have been reading about this album is all true. It IS that incredible. Just one note on the 2nd track  \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" - I didn't know a ballad can be played with this much attitude and even anger. You can virtually smell Sonny's sweat. The ultimate opposite of Stan Getz-style lyricism. 100 stars.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Yes, here it is: despite their numerous other godly efforts, this truly is Converge's best record to date. The Boston quintet (as they were before guitarist Aaron Dalbec's subsequent departure) find themselves at the absolute top of their game with 2001's Jane Doe, channeling all the promising chaos of When Forever Comes Crashing into a slicker, more concentrated, and altogether much more punishing release. Even 2004's You Fail Me, a punk-rock masterpiece in its own right, looks merely respectable in comparison.    To say that newcomer Ben Koller (replacing former drummer Damon Bellorado) holds down the rhythm section would be an obvious understatement from the very first listen. Even in comparison to Bellorado's admirable work on the numerous classics between Petitioning the Empty Sky and When Forever Comes Crashing, Koller's talent easily outshines his predecessor's. Jaw-dropping performances in \\"Fault and Fracture,\\" \\"Thaw,\\" and most notably, \\"Distance and Meaning\\" are exemplary of Koller's outstanding ability, placing him in the running with Chris Pennie of Dillinger Escape Plan fame as one of the genre's premier percussionists.    Guitarists Kurt Ballou and the aforementioned Dalbec absolutely dazzle. The opening taps on \\"Concubine\\" foreshadow the ensuant jarring with an unsettling lull, just moments before \\"Fault and Fracture,\\" perhaps Jane Doe's greatest technical gem, shreds off one of the album's quickest and most memorable riffs within its opening minute. \\"Thaw,\\" for all its own fleet-fingered mastery (particularly in its latter half), is also worthy of mention in the strings department. Pushing beyond simple technicality, however, the most impressive dimension of Jane Doe's guitar work is its incredible poignancy. Aptly exemplifying this attribute is the record's catharsis: an 11-and-a-half-minute title track, during which Ballou and Dalbec laboriously churn out seven minutes of low-end, dismally-rhythmic waves before building to an absolutely stunning andtexturally-gorgeous climax. With a sense of melody unheard in any of Converge's previous work, this haunting but genuinely uplifting finale combines brute heaviness with sincerity and vulnerability in a manner unparalleled by any record that I'd heard before or since.    Though admittedly, there's not much to be said for the individual distinctiveness of Nate Newton's work on bass for the bulk of the record (as, for the most part, it simply backs the walls of Ballou and Dalbec's dissonant riffage), his contribution on the anomalous, groove-laden \\"Hell To Pay\\" is certainly noteworthy. Similarly impressive is his gritty, fretboard-scaling interlude in \\"Heaven In Her Arms,\\" but such standout instances as these are few for Newton. Simply put, the bass tracks here aren't flashy or prodigious in and of themselves, but serve rather to supplement the sound of the album in its entirety as one organic-sounding whole. Overall, this approach is extremely effective.    It just wouldn't be a Converge record without Jacob Bannon's incomparable presence. Combining lyrical genius with a voice unmatched anywhere else in the genre, Bannon is arguably at his most effective on Jane Doe. The trademark scream that permeated both prior full-length efforts is unquestionably at its most abrasive here, with such vocal highlights being \\"Homewrecker,\\" \\"The Broken Vow,\\" and \\"Phoenix In Flames.\\" However, Bannon's eerie temperance on \\"Distance and Meaning\\" and \\"Hell To Pay\\" is just as powerful, and very refreshing.    Jane Doe is the veritable magnum opus of one of the most radiant talents in contemporary music. It should not be avoided at any cost.
B000B0WODA|4.0|First of all let me say that nothing on here tops \\"Take Me Out\\" from the first album.  The album itself however is actually better than the first one.  The band sounds more confident, and really lets loose.  \\"Do you want to\\" is this album's \\"Take me out\\" and doesnt quite live up to its predecessor.  The album sounds more complete with a good mix of high energy songs and slow ballads.  It's the kind of album that needs to be listened to from beginning to end to really appreciate it.
B0000028RR|5.0|Not only is this one of the best albums of the 90's, but one of the most stunning debuts to ever grace the world of music. It blends both rap and metal to perfection, with politcally charged lyrics and groovy, infectious guitar riffs that would make Limp Bizkit sh*t their pants. RATM is a great musical expierience. Closed-minded sh*theads need not apply.
0307276902|5.0|James Frey paints you a picture of what it is like being an addict in ways that a \\"normal\\" (as he puts it)person can almost fully grasp without having to be an addict. WOW - Thank you James for this book and I feel Oprah was wrong putting you down on her show. You did not write this book as a diary and I understand somethings were made up to intensify the book but you really did make it and survived addiction - you are awesome! Thank you for a peek into your world...
B00097A5HW|5.0|The Grammy's are so clueless.  This is better than all of the nominees.  In fact, this is the best album of ANY in the rock/pop categories in the last 5 years, in any language.  They give Grammy's to U2 when they didn't even release anything or release very average stuff.  They used to do that with Bonnie Raitt and Eric Clapton.  We all need to stop watching.  Do you still watch them? <br /> <br />Anyway, lets talk about why this album is tan bueno: <br /> <br />The diversity of the music here is incredible.  There is the incredibly rhythmic megahit - La Tortura.  The rivetting ballad \\"No\\".  Then, there is a song, \\"Obtener un Si\\" which is a throwback to the days of Burt Bacarach (I was too little, but remember his music from nostalgia shows).  How about the start of the album \\"En Tus Pupilas\\"?  What imagination!!!  La Pared is a little Coldplay-like but is extremely enjoyable, especially unplugged.  The Reggaeton version of La Tortura is not the best reggaeton out there, but its still strong.  There is only one song that should have been omitted - \\"Escondite Ingles\\", but it is still above the level of album filler.  A highly underrated song on the album is \\"Las de la Intuicion\\".  Shakira must know my wife when she says that women are the ones of intuition. <br /> <br />This album outshines \\"Ladrones\\" and is definitely far more enjoyable than \\"Laundry Service\\". <br /> <br />I can speak and understand Spanish, but dont understand everything on all songs on this album and dont care. <br /> <br />She might as well campout on stage for the \\"Premios - Lo Nuestro\\" on February 23rd.  Those awards really do honor the best of the year in each category. <br /> <br />This album is the best of 2005, in many categories.
B0000029GA|5.0|I remember when I'd first heard Illmatic, I was in complete and utter amazement.  The album had a friend and myself up till 3am the following morning having a phone convo on how good this album really is.  I was 16 at the time and havent heard anything as polished to the ear as this gem.  They say that a work of art is a masterpiece when time cannot date its power to that given period.  This is true with Illmatic.  Although there were many great albums before Illmatic...Paid in Full, Criminal Minded, Straight outa compton etc, these albums suffered from its dated sound of late 80's vernacular, flow and rhythm.  Illmatic on the other hand sounds so generic, as if its messages would be as relevant 40 years from now as it was in the past.  The breakdown is as follows: <br /> <br />Beasts:10 <br />Lyrics:10 <br />Flow:10 <br />Imagery:10 <br />Rhymes:10 <br /> <br />\\"So now I know the time, got an older mind, plus control the 9 fine so now I represent mine I'm\\" <br />-One time for ya mind <br /> <br />\\"shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul <br />only 12 tryin to tell me that he liked my style <br />then I rose wiping the blunts ash from my clothes <br />then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose <br />then told my little man I'll be ghost I prose <br />left some jewels in his skull he could sell if he chose...\\" <br />-One Love <br /> <br />doesn't get any better than this. <br /> <br />\\"It's getting hot in here so take off all your clothes\\" <br />-Nelly <br />What the HELL has hip hop done?
B00005J6UP|5.0|I have, will and currently LOVE the Goonies-- I probably will for my whole life. I first saw this when I was 5 (hey, I heard plenty of bad language my whole childhood through, and it didn't turn me into a depraved, immoral individual), and while I can understand a lot of parent's concerns about their children seening a movie with \\"bad words,\\" please don't overlook this movie for that purpose (c'mon, your kids have heard it, probably from your own mouth while driving). The cast is enigmatic, has wonderful chemistry and the imagination used to make this movie inspires TO THIS DAY. Although I dissent from the review that says that the magic is the friendship, I think the magic in this movie was definitely imagination. Mikey's imagination and his belief in his imagination and support form his friends saved the neighborhood. <br /> <br />Besides, there are too many giggle-worthy moments in this movie. I could sit here, give a recap and list them, but that would be beside the point.
B00005JKGO|5.0|The scene in the outdoor cafe is delicious and the scene in the fountain is now a standard (see \\"Boxing Helena\\"). Fellini hit the big-time with this movie and helped develop the future of film. A classic - never goes out of date. The (a) subject - what do those who have everything do for a thrill, especially when they're surrounded by the poor? What they do doesn't make a lot of sense, they flounder around and do stupid things just like the rest of us, only with better clothes, cars and houses.
B000092T6M|4.0|I know a lot of people hock, spit, gag, whine, moan and choke at Kevin Costner's accent in this movie, but for the love of Pete, people! He's not the only actor in this whole thing! <br /> <br />I absolutely LOVE this version of the Robin Hood tale. It was spooky, funny, action-packed- and come on, let's not forget the excellent performances! There were some wonderful actors in this movie; I can honestly say that I love Friar Tuck (was he funny or what?), Ahzeem (let's be serious; Morgan Freeman's tha' man, and the way that Muslims were portrayed through him was SO great), Duncan (was he hysterical or what? I was so mad when he died), Little John ([erfectly cast), Bull, and my personal favorite, Maid Marion (she was so modern and STRONG. Come on, how many times has Marion been portrayed like that? She was Robin's EQUAL). Then there were the villians. Man, was Alan Rickman just DISGUSTING as the Sheriff? The only one worse was Geraldine McEwan. She was so so creepy and gross, but FUNNY. <br /> <br />I especially liked this version of the DVD. The extended scenes gave us a much better understanding of the Sheriff's motives. I almost felt sorry for him, but not quite! This was much better than your run-of-the-mill Robin Hood story. Yes, I'm taking off one star on this review because of Kevin Costner's accent, but overall, he was pretty good in this movie. Give this DVD a chance, and you'll be sure to love it, too!
0553573403|2.0|These books do bring in a few postmoderm mechanisms to the fantasy domain. Evil is complex, people can change. Characters are not static. The story is told from multiple perspectives. So if you avoid other fiction to focus on fantasy these might be interesting to you.  However, it is not particularly innovative.<br /><br />However, the writing in and of itself can be better compared to Brian Jacques than JRR. While not all dawns are rosy, the terrains are over-stated and the descriptions sometimes laughable. If you can read, \\"Her loins ached from his lovemaking.\\" without laughing at the sheer badness of that prose, then the turbid nature of the writing will not trouble you.<br /><br />If you enjoy sprawling sagas of passion and revenge, then this is for you. For me, it seems like an intersection of the modern gothic and fantasy. If you like dramatic sprawling sagas with revenge of the son and passionate trysts you will like this.<br /><br />I experienced it as bad historical fiction with a little magic thrown in. I do enjoy historical fiction and found this rather tedious. However, it was not so horribly tedious that I did not finish it.  It is a good book for a long airplane ride, where you might get interrupted alot and don't need to concentrate.<br /><br />The reason I enjoy fantasy is that it can explore underlying issues and examine different social structures. There is nothing interesting here. If lesbian bondage is your thing, then buy better fiction. If history is your thing, buy good historical fiction. If fantasy is what you love for its potential to explore the larger possibilities of power, good and evil, and social change, then buy better fantasy.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|Have to admit, I wasn't a fun of the show when it was on Tv. After seeing serenity I fell in love with (Summer Glau). Then I just had to buy this set. Now I glad I did! I like it! I meen I know why it did not do well but Ilike it. In my opintion why Firefly didn't do that well, is because it had a wester feel to it. Come on Joss what were you thinking SI-FI WESTER dosn't mix. Ya the movie had some in it but not a big feeling. and they tone down the japaneey in the movie as well. But buy this TV show plus Summer hot....
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|Slight repetition of theme, but absolutely wonderful none-the-less. I give it 4 and 1/2 stars actually!
0060763280|2.0|I bought this book filled with excitement and motivation. The first part is inspiring and well written, though the words come right out of Tony Robbins, Earl Nightingale, and many others in this field... not from Harv and they're not secrets.  <br />By the time I made it to page 102, I felt like throwing up. The arrogant way in which Harv discusses \\"poor people\\" unworthy of his friendship and the \\"losers\\" associated with them, is far more negative than anyone I know. He also steers us away from \\"bad news\\" in the media. He also states that there are over 6.3 billion other people in the world with whom he can live with if his current friends bring him down. What a hero! So, not only does he come across as a snob, but also a selfish coward. Let's all turn our backs on the unfortunate world events and pay Harv our hard earned money... which brings me to my next point: On just about every page, he promotes his live and expensive seminars. In fact, this whole book is no more than a marketing ploy. What is really sad, is that he has made his fortune by stealing all of his ideas from first rate experts (though he calls it \\"modeling\\"). Finally, the so called thousands he saves at his seminars are the same people he tears down in round seven of this book. Yet, he spends nearly 200 pages convincing his readers that rich folks are the most wonderful out there. Too bad.
B00005MP58|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is the most true to the Jane Austen novel as any ever made. Colin Firth is fantastic and quite a dish as well. It is long, as it was a mini-series, but so worth the time! Do buy this... it is wonderful!
B000244EMO|3.0|There are few movie stars bigger than Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sure, he's not the most talented member of Hollywood's elite, but he definitely knows how to entertain an audience. In the latter part of the 1980s, Schwarzenegger's ingredients for success were a combination of big muscles, big guns and big explosions. With its often-exhilarating mixture of Alien and Rambo, Predator does not disappoint in the macho department. However, a lacklustre supporting cast and a predictable plot drag down the overall appeal of this film.<br /><br />Schwarzenegger plays Dutch, the leader of an elite group of commandos. They're called in by the CIA to rescue a group of high profile hostages held captive by guerrilla rebels deep in a Central American jungle. Tagging along for apparently no real reason is CIA agent Dillon ( Carl Weathers), an old buddy of Dutch.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to all, the Predator, a deadly alien, is prowling about the jungle with a bigger arsenal, complete with Freddy Krueger-style blades and scorching lasers. To top it off, the Predator can become nearly invisible if he so chooses, thus making life for Dutch and his troops a deadly game of survival that very few are going to live to talk about. One-by-one, the troops fall in gruesome fashion, until the climactic showdown in which primal instincts become the most powerful weapon.<br /><br />When it wants to be, Predator is a thrilling mix of big bangs, treacherous landscapes and impressive special effects. The Predator is a one of the best in a long line of killer aliens to come out of Hollywood. There are, however, several points where clich&eacute;s take over and suck nearly all the suspense out of the plot. Luckily, the pace picks up for an unforgettable final 20 minutes.<br /><br />The film's greatest weakness comes from the brutally-weak supporting cast, led by the eccentric Minnesota governor and former professional wrestler, Jesse Ventura. He plays a big-mouthed tobacco-chewing generator of hokey lines. While he \\"ain't got time to bleed,\\" I certainly didn't shed any tears when the Predator made easy work of him. Weathers, most famous for playing Apollo Creed in the Rocky series, also delivers a laughable performance.<br /><br />At the heart of Predator is a dissection of the senses. The Predator cannot see as we do, but through infrared. Looking closely at the characters he takes out, it becomes easy to notice that the Predator is, in essence, stripping Dutch's senses away. One trooper wears abnormally large glasses. Thus when he dies, Dutch loses part of his sight. Another has an uncanny knack to sniff out trouble by sensing it with his nose. When it comes time for the final showdown, Dutch and the Predator make an equal match as they are both in their most primal form.<br /><br />There is much going on in Predator.

When it comes time for the final showdown, Dutch and the Predator make an equal match as they are both in their most primal form.  <br /> <br />There is much going on in Predator. Unfortunately, not all of it is good.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day is to be commended for their artistic brilliance and for standing up to that vile thug George W. Bush.  More importantly, they won a Grammy for record of the year, one of the ceremony's highest honors!  I love Green Day!  Congratulations, boys!
B000002LEE|5.0|When I first got this album. I had no clue when it was released. When I went to go look up what year the album was released, I was shocked it was 1988. When you listen to Nothing's Shocking, you would honestly believe that it was ahead of its time, even this time. It has punk, it has funk, it has ska, it has such intoxicating rock you cannot help but to find yourself immersed in the unique vocals of Perry Farrell, the subtle basslines of Eric Avery, the surging and powerful guitar of Dave Navarro, and the commanding drumming of Stephen Perkins (who is probably the finest drummer in the history of rock behind Led Zeppelin's John Bonham). <br /> <br />It's an outstanding piece of work and still is today one of the greatest definitions to the term \\"alternative rock\\". Songs such as \\"Mountain Song\\", \\"Jane Says\\", and \\"Idiots Rule\\" illustrates an entire canvas Jane's Addiction crossed into in terms of musical styles and the ability to set not only an entire atmosphere, but an entire environment of powerful and deep sound that is nothing but futuristic and ambitious. <br /> <br />To really appreciate this album, you must look at music more than just candy for your ears, you must look at it as true art. Nothing's Shocking is an astounding piece of art.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|The film is funny at many parts, though the entire plot is serious. The action is great, and the axe gang is unwittingly similar to the Mr. Smith clones in the matrx. Overall, great choreorgraphy and special effects on the martial arts. The film is dubbed in english because it is acted in chinese. Nonetheless, the film is still very funny and great parts.
B0008ISM40|5.0|This is without a doubt the second best NIN album. Trent still has it, this album is all about maturity, and being at the top of your art.
B000AADYRQ|1.0|I am always looking for something different, as indie rock is usually a great place to start (when of course I am not in my mood to listen to death metal) After hearing many good things about Death Cab for Cutie being a great Indie band, I took a listen to this, and my god I almost fell asleep. These guys are a total drag, with almost no emotion to it. I have heard that the older stuff from these guys is much better, as some of the reviews have really been harsh to this album. This is the only one that I have to go on though, and not that I dont care for it, it just flat out sucks. Want some good Indie Rock try on Some Trans Am or check out some James Katz..Avoid this mess
0143034901|4.0|This marvelous story ultimately collapses about 6/8ths of the way through--what a disappointment! Still worth reading, since it may not disappoint you.
B000003C2S|4.0|If you are going to write a review (HINT HINT REVIEWER BELOW) then maybe you should give the reason why you dont like the album, not just because you dont like the genere. True, I rip a few albums from artist I can stand, but for reasons of musicanship, lyrics, and Sellout status. Death is a very creative and very talented Death Metal Band. Maybe if you took the time to put down your Black Crows CD's (who yes I think are good) and other stuff, and maybe listen with an open mind, you might just like it. Small minded musical people have no buiness reviewing music if they only like one Genere.<br />TO THE REVIEWER BELOW: ONCE AGAIN, YOU DONT LIKE RAP AND POP? Fine! You dont like Madonna or any Hip Hop? FINE! But you still didnt give the reason you didnt like this album by Death, you just said you didnt like the Genere, so why review it then. I like all types of music, and I review all Generes (I even have John Coltrane in my reviews)Your the one who shouldnt be given musical advice since you are closed minded when it comes to certain forms of music. YOu think all Death Metal is garbage. Fine, but dont review it then, because its obvious you arent going to like any of it then. I reviewed My Chemical Romance because I like certain forms of Pop Punk, but I think they blow, but I still listen to the Genere. Do you understand what I am trying to say now, or are you really that thick-headed.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|When first listening to this CD I noticed a great deal of change from the first two CDs by AX7. The vocals greatly changed from a rawer metal feel to almost a nu-metal feel. If you like the slightly whinier feel to your music then you would enjoy his voice. The reason they changed so much though is because the lead singer actually had a great deal of damage done to his vocal chords from the way he was singing before, so this forced him to change his singing.  <br />Apart from the vocals the guitar is sensational; you can observe a great increase in talent from the first two albums to this one. At the end of the album there is a Flamenco guitar solo that will blow your mind if you know what I am talking about. The musical structure of this band is very complex and uniquely original. If you appreciate a strong musical composition I would suggest this band.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This is a great band.  Incredible melodies and great musicianship.  I really love the fact that this band isn't afraid of the GUITAR!!  I was originally afraid that this was some nu-metal, emo, screamo- metal punk band, but I could not be more wrong.  This is one incredible band that has blown me away.  I hope you get all the credit that you deserve in this very weird music era.  I really wish I lived around 10 or 20 years ago.  I really think the music you have created is very much the music I love.  Thank you very much!!!
B00005JLD4|1.0|Last night, having mistakenly taken the video store owner's recommendation, I watched the movie Rabbit Proof Fence. As soon as the opening credits began, I realized what was in store for me - ethnic praising, white bashing - but I watched it anyway. Even though I'm keenly aware of anti-white propaganda in films, I was still amazed.<br /><br />The stereotyping was so blatant and over the top. The white people were monstrous in their punctiliousness, their coldness, their stupidity on the grand scale. And they were contemptible in their cowardliness, laziness, lack of perseverance. The aborigines were brave, loving, kind, self-sacrificing, polite, gentle, wise, determined, in touch with nature, cleverer than the whites, etc. No indication that they'd be driving cars into kangaroos for sport in a few decades.<br /><br />Whites have been primed for years to accept such distortions without objecting.<br /><br />Then I remembered a movie I saw in my childhood, probably over 30 years ago - \\"Crazy Horse.\\" As I remember it, the chief himself was a noble hero and the most hideous character in the film was an ugly faced white military leader who gave the Indians a gift of thousands of blankets contaminated with smallpox.<br /><br />Being brainwashed like this is the reason that White people don't do enough to protect themselves and their civilization. The Australian government's policy of removing all half-caste Aboriginal children to special training schools was not perfect, but it was not racist. The whole point was to take the children away from a primitive stone-age culture so that they could become part of modern Australian culture. In other words, it was inclusive.<br /><br />This film is about racism all right, but it is about the racist stereotyping of whites as evil and every other race as good, and it is about brainwashing Whites to hate their own culture and race so that they will sit idly by while it is destroyed by minority empowerment, historical revisionism, and mass immigration of more `good' people (i.e. non-Whites).sionism, and mass immigration of more `good' people (i.e. non-Whites). <br />
B000000WA4|5.0|Let me start off by saying that most of the reviewers here seem to be a lot younger than me.  I am 41 years old, so I have listened to music for a long time.  I enjoy many types and genres of music.  With that being said, Mellon Collie is one of GREATEST albums ever made by any band.  It is an epic masterpiece and I love all 28 songs on this classic piece of work.  It ranks up there with Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"The Wall\\", Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\", Pantera's \\"Vulger Display of Power\\" and U2's \\"The Joshua Tree\\" as one of the greatest, and one of my favorite albums of all time.  What else can I say.
0895260131|5.0|The book points out facts that muslims don't want you to know.  In 100 years, since 700AD, they conquered the whole Middle-East, North Africa, Cyprus, Spain, and parts of France.  If you don't want to read the whole Koran, read the parts that this books points out.  When muslims have a Kalashnikov (the modern day sword) and the Koran next to it with their fingers on the line that calls for the death of infidels, believe THEM.  They know the book back and forth.  Don't believe the people marketing their religion to the West as a peaceful religion.  Don't believe that they say that their god is the same as yours.  In their book, Jesus wasn't killed or resurrected.  Mohammad tells his followers that the writers of the bible are lying.  At least Jews believe He died (one of the most important aspects of His life).  They just don't believe He resurrected.  Muslims don't believe He died or was resurrected.  It's in their book.  The Trinity throws a monkey wrench in their \\"Your god is the same as my god\\".   <br /> <br />Don't believe the violence in the book?  Talk to any minority in the Middle East.  Do you know any Armenians, Copts, Farsis (the original Persians), Serbs, Greeks, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Hindus, or pre-1948 Jews?  They will tell you stories that you wouldn't believe.  ALL have the same fate.  Who would know better than the people who lived in their midst?  <br /> <br />Sorry to say, but the muslim religion will always be there.  It has spread through violence and has been maintained in violence.  There is no room for criticism in their book.  It is for the savage mind, as you can see the dark continents are the only subscribers to the religion.  Any one who questions it is met with death.  Anyone who converts from it is met with death.   <br /> <br />All this is written in their book.  Don't believe it when they try to justify everything with the Crusades.  Theirs was a response to the invasions.  Also, it had nothing to do with the Bible and Jesus.  NOTHING.  Back then, it was written in Latin and was illegal to translate it.   Jesus would never condone their actions, and the followers believed their leaders.  But the conquests of Islam follows Mohammad's words and his own deeds, for he himself was a bloody conqueror, a man with many wives and concubines, including a 7-9 year old wife, which makes him a pedophile.   <br /> <br />
0895260131|4.0|In this timely, hot button book, Robert Spencer examines the motivation and goals of, not necessarily, just the terrorists alone but fellow extremists and, by association, all Muslims in general.<br /><br />He claims there is a substantial quantity of misinformation being disseminated about Islam, some officially and some by apologists. Islam, which, translates into surrender, appears to be aptly named since there was plenty of surrendering going on among Islam's perceived enemies in the first hundred and fifty years of the religion. That's when aggressive, ruthless armies of the Prophet Muhammad, poured out of Arabia, spreading the nascent religion across a swath of Africa and Asia from the Atlantic Ocean to India. Later Indonesia and parts of India, Thailand, China, Malaysia and the Philippines were added. The victims of this onslaught were give three options: surrender and convert to Islam, surrender and become a dhimmi (a second-class citizen subject to onerous taxation) or death.<br /><br />This area now contains some one point two billion Muslims, which Spencer claims are all potential enemies of the rest of the inhabitants of the globe. The reasoning is that the seeds of confrontation are intertwined within the fabric of Islam, through the Muslim holy book and he cites various passages from the Qur'an to substantiate his theory. At the head of these passages is Jihad, which means struggle. The struggle, according to Spencer is to struggle against the infidels (non-believers) to achieve a position of preeminence where Islam reigns supreme.<br /><br />We all know that this is what bin Laden wants but it's been widely reported that this view is a perversion of Islam. According to Spencer, this is straight out of the Qur'an and the perversion is that this information is being withheld from the public, ostensibly to not engender additional angst with John Q. Public. Even mainstream Muslim's seem to have trouble coming to grips that their holy book is the basis of so much terrorism and could be so inconsistent.<br /><br />Other passages that should be of concern to Westerners are the traditions of deceit and duplicity. Muslims should not befriend infidels and it's expected that they should lie to them (but not Muslims). If they do befriend an infidel, it should only be to gain an advantage and any agreements with infidels are again, to gain an advantage and if no longer needed, should be discarded. No wonder Israel cannot get a peace agreement with the Palestinians.<br /><br />Spencer also takes a cursory look at the Crusades. He states that, although they appear to have been a waste of time and manpower, they keep the Muslims at bay for almost two hundred years. Spencer believes this gave the Europeans just enough time to build their strength and technology to hold their own when the Islamic hordes, once again set their sights there.<br /><br />Even so, there are large pockets of Muslims left over from Jihadists incursions in Bosnia, Kosovo, Albania and Spain. It is Spencer's contention that without the Crusades we might all be on our knees five times a day facing Mecca. However, that still might happen since an estimated fifteen million Muslim immigrants, with more daily, have inundated Europe. As we've all seen on the news recently with bombings in London and Madrid and riots in France, these immigrants can be problematic, but they also could become a fifth column.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) is the kind of book that can get under your skin if you let it. I'm sure it's accurate and factual and in comparison to other similar books I've read, specifically, about the plight of Muslim women, it backed what I had previously read. However, it seems to me, to be written with a conservative slant. It seems to highlight the worst of Islam, giving only perfunctory concessions to other views. The fact that Regnery Publishing, a well-known right wing publisher, publishedthe book reinforces that feeling.<br /><br />As for the author, Robert Spencer, he did a good job of presenting his case in a fluid, easily understandable and readable style. I personally believe what he wrote but many would feel it wasn't balanced. He is obviously well versed on the subject of the book, providing the chapter/verse in the Qur'an, wherever he paraphrases a passage. He has a thorough knowledge of the subject and puts his views forward in a believable method. In addition, he provides many interesting sidebars where there are comparisons of the teachings of Muhammad and Jesus, quotes from historic figures, Books You're Not Supposed to Read and Just Like Today segments.<br /><br />Spencer makes several good points, such as saying our war on terror is incorrectly named, terror being a tactic. He says the enemy is the Jihadists and the war should be so named. I also got a kick out of Spencer's term for outrageous, seventy-two virgins in heaven Muslim belief. He called it bordello paradise.<br /><br />Frankly, if you are looking for some good news about the Muslims, this book is not for you, unless you consider learning more about their downside, good news. The bottom line, according to Spencer, is their can be no long-term peaceful co-existence with the Muslim society unless they modify the aggressive tenants of the Qur'an. Don't hold your breath.g publisher, published the book reinforces that feeling.  <br /> <br />As for the author, Robert Spencer, he did a good job of presenting his case in a fluid, easily understandable and readable style.

B000E1YVZU|5.0|I absolutly loved this movie. When i saw previews for it on television, i thought it would be a different sort of movie, since they showed dancing and singing. I had no idea it was a musical on Broadway until i did some research online before going to see it.<br /><br />Ok, on to the movie. I loved it, as i already said. It was both fun, and sad at time. i dont want to spoil it for anyone who has yet to see it(what are you waiting for!) I was very suprised to hear it got mixed reviews. But then, alot of movies lately are gettign mixed reviews, no matter how good they are.<br /><br />The songs were great, i especially liked \\"La Vie Boheime\\" and \\"Out Tonight\\".  Right after seeing it, i went out and got the soundtrack. :-)<br /><br />You must see this, whether you've seen the play or not!
B000AYEIZY|5.0|One day I was in Best Buy shopping with the missus for a new fridge.  One fridge had a TV screen in it.  I saw it and did a double take.  Hey, that's Jack Bruce... and that's... that's Clapton and there's... Baker!  What the hey?  I stood open mouthed in front of the fridge.  My missus had no idea why I was so enthralled with that fridge!  I had no idea this wonderful reunion had occurred.  I had to pinch myself. (I didn't buy that particular fridge though).<br /><br />So this is Cream, but it ain't the Cream you heard in the 60's.  That Cream was full of youthful vigor and uncontrollable fire.  This Cream is full of aged wisdom and measured fire.  Anyone who reports their playing has not changed is dead wrong.  Today's Cream is far more skilled, more accomplished. If the old Cream was a wildfire, this Cream is more like controlled bursts from a flame-thrower.<br /><br />The tunes are basically the same tunes you heard 36 years ago on the Lps but the playing more closely resembles the actual studio sides of that band rather than the live sides - and that's ok.  Recently I picked up Cream Gold (which has all but one of the live tracks - Train Time - from Wheels of Fire).  I was amazed at the sheer volume of that incarnation (6 Marshall Stacks between Bruce and Clapton) and while I really enjoy the music I couldn't help but notice it had something of a sameness from track to track on the live disc.  Oh yeah, it's incredible, thunderous jamming, but one gets easily lost in the furious maelstrom!  Funny, it didn't sound that way when I was a teenager...  Anyway, you don't find that sameness from track to track on this release.  It's controlled, measured bursts from the flame-thrower and it is hot hot hot.  Stormy Monday, previously uncovered by this band is the high-point for Clapton here.  Lord have mercy!  Baker is more restrained with his double bass drum pedals and doesn't continually sound like an army of African drummers. Precision bursts from the flame-thrower - Baker's drumming on Deserted Cities of the Heart is thunderous at the right points and otherwise in a steady groove.  Bruce's voice is almost as good as it was way back when (Bruce has always been one of my favorite singers) and  the lines he plays on his bass (sans the \\"fartsy\\" fuzz sound\\") on this new disc are just tremendous - the perfect complement to Baker and Clapton.<br /><br />It's so good to see/hear these guys back together again as seasoned, mature players.  It's sweet Devonshire clotted cream.  Pass me a scone and some jam.  I just love it and so will you.<br /><br />oh, and to all the nay-sayers that want this band to sound exactly like it did 36 years ago... that's just plain stupid - and insulting to these musicians.  Real artists never stand still, they are always changing.  It is only natural that the re-united band will sound different. There is no denying that they are far more skillful - you want them to unlearn everything they've learned in the past 36 years just so they can sound the same for you?  Then go put on your tie-dyed t-shirt and harachi sandals, pull out the Live at the Fillmore sides of Wheels of Fire, crank up the volume, and close your eyes and pretend you are still 17.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Any time I want to wind down, Norah is the way to go.  Her smokey yet honeyed deliery is a simply joy to listen to.  When I first heard her, I was amazed of her age.  In a romp shaking, vocal-challenged music industry, it's great that there are still a few shining stars.
B00005JM0B|2.0|So here's the rundown. Machines will kill humans, but California's governor won't. Add yourself one particularly annoying machine disguised as an annoying chick, and you've got this movie. <br /> <br />Actually, it wasn't altogether a gag-flick (\\"Gag\\" referring to a muscle spasm in the throat prior to vomiting, not a type of joke). Arnold's back again, and this time he's fighting a new terminator, and this one actually knocks off a few of its targets before being turned into pencil shavings. This new terminator is a lot like the one from Terminator 2, with all the liquid-metal junk, but as any chick-robot would do, this one only uses that power to look pretty. So how does she fight? One word: Accessories. Her right hand can do this cute little Transformer act and apparently turn into all sorts of weapons such as a flame thrower, a plasma cannon, and I'm sure a mascara brush is included in there somewhere. Arnold is back with his custom shotgun loaded with slugs (anyone who has played any FPS since Doom has to respect the value of such a weapon), and the humans use whatever they can to waste bullets ruining the chick-bot's makeup. Seriously, that's all she does. <br /> <br />So yeah, a bunch of stuff happens, some terribly animated lame puppet robots shoot people, and chick-bot dies in a major hissy fit. Don't believe me? Watch that robot die and just TELL me she isn't planning to spread all sorts of nasty rumors about the Arnold-bot to get back at him for blowing her up. <br /> <br />Action scenes were well enough done, especially a pretty cool car chase involving a crane. Gotta love that. Plot...well, I was glad for the ending of the movie, which nicely didn't end in a \\"Hooray we saved the world again\\" manner as I had suspected. The world does indeed get wasted, but we're gonna win in the end anyway as long as John Conner survives, or at least that's what they tell us. I think the writers thought to appeal to the 3 women in the audience by trying to pass it off asa love-story twist at the end, but come on...Chick-Bot didn't even get to go to the Princess' Slumber Party in Genovia. No girl would be fooled into liking a movie that didn't include that. <br /> <br />As for cast, well, no one in the world could ever be Terminator except Arnie, let's accept that as truth. John Conner is played by a rather weird-looking runty little guy, but he manages to do a decent show. Claire Danes somehow manages to co-star with him (or with Arnold, take your pick), and actually fires a gun once in the movie in an Avenge-my-Daddy's-Death chick-rage (similar to Princess Vespa's \\"He shot my hair!\\" rampage in Space Balls). And of course, Chick-bot is played by some chick that a few men might consider to be hot. Apparently the director did, which is why she got the part. I think she had 2 lines the entire movie. <br /> <br />Oh wait, I can't forget the scene where Chick-bot captured the hearts of american families across the country. Remember her cool liquid metal cosmetics? Well she can also use them to make her breasts grow. She uses this when she gets pulled over by a cop. Oh, you are so clever, Chick-bot!! Too bad she totally blows it out the window when she ends up killing the cop anyway and taking his gun, thus clearly showing that the whole boob-growing concept was really an expression of the director's perverted nature screaming to get out. Poor, poor man. Let us all pity him now.
0060930187|4.0|At first, the main character's psyhcosis seemed almost logical. Then, slowly Ester Greenwood lost touch. Plath did a great job of leading the reader along with Ester as she experienced it. I found myself really pulling for her and hoping that she would get better. It is a stomach turning coincidence that Ester feared the Bell Jar would return because it certainly did for the author. It was a very interesting read and I highly recommend it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Better than the bends, very awesome energetic and melloy album by the greatest band in the world.

B00004XONN|5.0|This could very well be the greatest album created in the last 100 years and it only has 4 stars!!!!!!!  Even 5 stars isn't enough.  whats wrong with you poeple.  do you know what art is?  the poeple who rated this album low either didn't listen to this album enough to really understand it, or they don't have any kind of emotions which are responsible for making music sound good. <br /> <br />KID A is even better than OK Computer.  Their are more amazon reviews for kid A than dark side of the moon, OK computer, and any album I've ever heard of.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I hardly ever watch the same movie twice in a row. But with this one I did. I had to. It was that mesmerizing.<br /><br />This movie could easily have grossed over $200M if it wasn't so bold in attacking the religious right and those in power.<br /><br />Sin City is where people regularly suffer oppression and injustice from those in power (priests, senators, and police). It is a story of those who choose to fight against their brutal oppressors.<br /><br />The protagaonists, although far from perfect and ideal, genuinely want to do good and right in a world where virtue is rare. Fighting back often means making the powerful suffer. It becomes a game of who can inflict the most pain on the other. Is such a world so far from the reality?<br /><br />The movie is bold in its search for the truth of the human heart. Will a man do anything for a woman who has given him her body and kindness when no one else has? Can a good cop overcome his irresistible attraction to a voluptuous 19 year old whom he has saved from rape only 8 years earlier?<br /><br />The protagonists and villians are highly unique. Mickey Rourke was extraordinary as Marv and deserves an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />I believe the footage of Jessica Alba doing a cowboy dance on stage will be studied as a cinematography masterpiece.<br /><br />This movie hits on all cylinders in its bold attempt to provoke thought and passion in its viewers.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I saw this band on TRL (sad to say) and their video premiered on the show and I loved the song and the video.  I found out that Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy signed them so I assumed they would be a cool band.  I bought their CD the same week I saw them on TRL and I love it.  I put it on every night when I am on the Treadmill.  It just makes you want to dance and is very unique.  I am so happy with my purchase and I hope to see more of this bands work in the future.
B000929AJQ|3.0|I will admit that i was one of those that dismissed this album when it first came out but now i'm digging it. it seems that trent reznor tries very hard to deliver his best with every album that he releases and sometimes he makes bad decisiones on certain things that ultimately hinders his work. I don't really know where does this album fails...perhaps the repetitive nature of the sound?? Or perhaps the fact that if trent would really learn to sing a melody or two the work would seem a bit more fresh. I don't know but i do know this album ain't bad at all. it ain't no downward spiral that's for sure but it's still good.
B0006399FS|4.0|I'm more of a hip hop head, tell you the truth.  But I just downloaded this album after u2 won all those awards at the Grammys. I always liked VERTIGO and that performance with Mary J. Blige was incredible, Mary tore it up. <br /> <br />It's a pretty good album, I was impressed because a lot of my friends don't like u2.  They admit they are rock n roll kings or whatever but  the last few albums sucked.  Don't know what the hating is about, it's got some good songs.  A few are a little too soft for me, but VERTIGO and ALL BECAUSE OF YOU are really strong.  Also like LOVE AND PEACE OR ELSE. <br /> <br />I thought that YAHWEH, A MAN AND A WOMAN, and ORIGINAL OF THE SPECIES were a little corny for me.  its a pretty good CD, if my friends hate on this I might go pick up some of their older stuff, cause I thought it was pretty good.   <br /> <br />Now should it have beaten out my man Kanye West for all those Grammys? I dont think so....but they let him open for them on their tour and allow Kanye to expose his music to another audience.  That's hot. <br /> <br />Overall, give it a B- (just saw that review below by the \\"kids review\\", what does that have to do with anything? shouldn't that be deleted?) Out
B000002UAX|5.0|Overrated? No chance! This Beatles album, though not their best, is still one of the landmark recordings in the history of popular music. One or two of the tracks are silly (none sillier than \\"Rev 9\\") BUT even that, probably in retrospect, has a charm to it (it wouldn't be the same album without it), although at the time, I'm sure I would have been like \\"what's this? no need for it\\"  if I was old enough to remember 1968 (which I'm not). <br /> <br />I got this album as a kid, I had bought their greatest hits compilations and my parents saw it cheap in a record shop (they had lost the cover - and were selling it without for about 50 pence, or something), so they got it for me. Songs like \\"Glass Onion\\" add an interesting take (a \\"follow up\\" to various past Beatles glories), while, \\"Martha My Dear\\" is a lovely ballad done splendidly by Paul McCartney (the sort of style he would continue to do as a sideline to rock with his post-beatles combo, Wings). <br /> <br />\\"Long, Long, Long\\" is a interesting Lennon hippie slow rock number that helps explain why he refer to this album as \\"The Son Of Sgt. Pepper\\", indeed it would have fit just as well on that album as on this. <br /> <br />Harrison had a larger part in the songwriting, at least compared to the other Beatles albums before this. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" was and still is a big hit with the fans, and his \\"Savoury Truffle\\" is a very good lesser known (but still fantastic) song. <br /> <br />Ringo too writes here, \\"Dont Pass Me By\\", is a very good effort and disproves even further the myth that he was the one in the group who couldn't do anything. <br /> <br />This is an album that many would enjoy and I give it a well deserved 5 star rating!
B000BVEKO0|5.0|I have been a korn fan since the sixth grade and i have all of their albums. i own them all, even the all mixed up album. But See you on the other side blows away all previous albums (in my opinion)! Even though they're missing a guitarist, they are still pushing out some incredible sound. The sound's a little different in a GREAT way! There's more Jon Davis and his bagpipes. Do yourself a favor and shell out the extra, hard earned dough and get the limited edition. It comes with a bonus c.d. with 5 extra hardcore trax, alond with two live songs you can view on you dvd player. Overall, this album is a definite must-have for ANY KORN FAN. And if you haven't gotten it yet, what's wrong with you ? Go get it, right now!
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles shine at their best on these 17 songs. Half Rock N Roll, Half Pop Opera, all great! <br /> <br />\\"Come Together\\" is a Lennon lead fun rocker, that was banned by the BBC for \\"advertising Coca Cola\\", their loss, still they did play the singles B-side \\"Something\\", ah-yes, considered by many to be George Harrison's finest hour, it is a great love ballad that was also recorded by Elvis Presley shortly after. A long list of crooners have also cut this disc, but few come close to the Beatles version.  <br />The first McCartney lead track on this long playing album is \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\", a novelty song about a serial killer, that McCartney sings like any other song. It may not sound too funny, but once you listen to it (especially the first time) it will have you in hysterics, and for that reason alone it is one of my favorites! <br />\\"Oh! Darling!\\" is a lesser known Beatles track, but still charming, but perhaps my least favorite here. Still, \\"I want you\\" is a hard edged rocker that has a abrupt ending. The final chords build up and up and then just end. Apparently John Lennon didn't know how to end the build up, so just decided to cut it quick. Of course, he could have had an ending, but didn't find it would suit the song, and he may just have been right. <br />Ringo Starr takes the microphone for one of his own songs \\"Octopuses Garden\\", another charming funny song that is just as hilarious as Paul's \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" already mentioned. <br />\\"Here Comes The Sun\\" is another Harrison song that many also consider  to be one of his best ever. \\"Because\\" is a song sung by Paul, George and John as a trio and is a nice song sung in the style of a barbershop quartet (or, in this case, trio). <br /> <br />\\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" (originally track 1 on the second side of the album on vinyl) is the star of The Beatles \\"Pop Opera\\", a series of songs that run into each other. \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", \\"Sun King\\", \\"Mean Mister Mustard\\", \\"Polythene Pam\\" and \\"She Came In\\" all run into each other and are excellent and the album would be fine if it ended here, but the next three songs \\"Golden Slumbers\\", \\"Carry That Weight\\" and \\"The End\\" also run into each other and are considered to be the highlight/climax of the abbey road experience, of which, to appreciate you have to listen. <br />\\"Her Majesty\\" is McCartneys fun tribute to her royal highness, Queen Elizabeth the second, that wasn't originally considered to be on the all, but ended up on it anyway. <br /> <br />Abbey road was the name of the road in London that the studio used to record this album was located in, still there today. In fact it was the studio used to record most Beatles songs, and hit songs by others too.  <br /> <br />Arguably their greatest album in their later years (being from 1967 to 1970), just as arguably their best album overall, even possibly the greatest album by anyone ever. \\"Abbey Road\\" is a must for all Beatles fans, which means a must for music lovers!
B000002ADT|5.0|A true must have for me, there are no if ands or buts about it. This is the one cd in existence, that I can say beyond the shadow of a doubt, that I would take with me on a deserted island. From the opening notes of \\"So What\\" the ground work is well laid. The deep almost murky rythym of the Bass, a la the classic-masterful playing of Paul Chambers. To the sly almost slick to a fault symbol tapping of Jimmy cobb! Finally the rich tone of the trumpet cuts through the speakers like a flash of light rather than a sound. And the spell is cast, you are hearing a beautiful and rare moment in time.  committed to wax for all to witness, and it is nothing less than superb, over and over and over and over and over........ <br /> <br />Peace: <br />The*Hot*Wax*Kid
B00005JOFO|5.0|I won't go on and on about how beautiful the scenery is, how great the acting is, how wonderful the direction is, and how touching the story is.  Plenty of reviews have already done that.   <br /> <br />However, I do want to address some of the complaints about this movie.  I have heard people complain that Brokeback Mountain wouldn't be getting as much recognition if it were a love story between a man and woman. These people are claiming that the movie really isn't very good but is achieving critical acclaim due to the its controversial storyline.  I cannot disagree more, and here is why: <br /> <br />1)  This is NOT just a movie about gay cowboys.  Yes, the two men fall in love and carry out out a twenty-year long affair.  However, the movie is more about unrequited love, and how external influences can prevent true love from ever fully blossoming.  I know plenty of movies that received a huge amount of critical acclaim that sound very similar:  The Bridges of Madison County, Titanic, and Love Story are good examples.  These are audience favorites that remind us how painful and sad love can really be--and Brokeback Mountain accomplishes this as well. <br /> <br />2)  The \\"controversial\\" content really isn't all that ground-breaking.  Doesn't anybody remember other critical favorites that touched upon homosexual love?  The Color Purple??  That was over twenty years ago!  And Brokeback and the Color Purple also both focus on OTHER issues besides being gay--family, violence, and finding strength and confidence in one's self. <br /> <br />3)  There are other factors that make this movie great besides the controversial content--the musical score is beautiful, the acting is right on target (Heath Ledger in particular succeeds in exuding multiple emotions while barely speaking), the cinematography is gorgeous, and the screenplay is a model of how to adapt a short story into a movie--it keeps all the scenes and dialogue while expanding the areas that help move the plot forward (the women in particular get larger roles in the movie). <br /> <br />All in all, I feel that anyone who says this movie is getting all this attention simply because it's about two men falling in love hasn't watched the movie.  They haven't seen it, or they'd realize it encompasses what could be the largest human desire that we know of:  that we all want to be loved, and when we find that person we shouldn't let him or her go.  Who can't relate to that?
B0007GAERG|5.0|Okay first off who is this MiMi? well that was my first question about the title of this disc. Then I wondered what the Emancipation thing was all about. Well if you listen to the disc, now,now boys and girls, the kid would never do such a thing when given the choice. But you see, I have found myself in a situation (I swear!)where I have no choice. And yes I did the honorable thing of b_tching and moaning about the whole experience. At first that is, hold on, I know, but hear me out, you see kiddies the thing is this, if you are forced to sit and listen to this disc, (I did mention that I had no choice right?) You may find that it is actually pretty good stuff. Very well written and produced, and apparently MiMi can sing her lovely tush off,she sounds like a happy songbird, and the whole MiMi tag is just perfect for the sake of reestablishing herself. Yeah I am going out on a limb here but, I don't care I like the freakin disc! so be it. <br /> <br />Peace: <br />*The*Hot*Wax*Kid
0307276902|1.0|James Frey swindled the gullible into thinking this garbage piece fiction is truth. Truth or fiction the writing is awful, and this man is only gaining wealth through the swine of oprah's book club. This makes me sick, please ignore him so maybe he will  finally disappear. Well opinions are like A-holes, everyone's got one. Why am I even wasting time writing this....?
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Pounding. Hypnotic. Frenetic. Emotional. Intense. Melodic. Not all the adjectives in the world could do justice in pinpointing what is the masterpiece System Of A Down has created in their double release of Mezmerize and Hynotize. Mezmerize, released in May 2005 contains one of the most heavily played songs at the time, \\"B.Y.O.B\\", whilst Hypnotize was released in November 2005, in effect completing one of the most important contributions to music of the decade. The highly satirical lyrics combined with the complex melodies touch the soul deeply, and refuse to leave the mind. This is not the kind of album that comes around very often... This is the epitome of original, creative music. Buy this album along with Hypnotize. You will not regret it!
0385336810|5.0|I highly recommend this book! very funny, good story, well written,...ideal to chill out....it's a real pleasure to read.
6304696566|5.0|Warner's has announced there will be a 2 DVD special edition of the Searchers out in 2006, with a complete restoration of the print and plenty of extras, so save your money and buy this instead of the current barebones DVD with a mediocre tranfer and no extras. <br />The Five Stars is for the movie itself, not the blah DVD presentation there of. <br />
B000089RVR|5.0|For the moment, this is my favorite cd. I cannot stop listening to it, and its not only because Dido's voice is so enchanting, all the songs on it are simply superb and I love not having to use the FF ( skip forward) button on it.  <br /> <br />She sounds like a sea at midnight in dreamy melancholy with sweet undertones. For a sophomore album I think she grew as an artist, and since I really liked the first cd, I had no idea that the second one could be even better. <br /> <br />I love blasting it really loud to the point where you get the same feeling as when you are submerged in a bathtub, her voice cradles you whole body and makes all the hair stand up. Don't Leave Home is so full of soul and so mesmerizing that it sticks in my head for days even after one listen. Her smoky voice curls over the funky lyrics and combined with an orchestra of sound it makes for a gorgeous song. <br /> <br />I think all the songs on the album are fabulous, but the ones that stand out the most are Don't Leave Home, White Flag,  The Land is Mine and See the Sun. Each one is deep, luminous and something that you will love for a long time. I can't imagine being tired of this album. Excellent soft lovely music for any time of day or mood.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|As far as \\"David Holt Preaus \\"A2xistguy\\" (Atlanta, Georgia)\\" is concerned, dude, you should read someones review before you bash them and call them a bigot.  Had you actually read this review or the one I'd previously written that mysteriously disapeared, you'd know that I'm not a bigot at all, anything but a bigot, I'm seeing through all the typical Hollywood stereotypes found in this movie, if everyone else did the same, there would be no such thing as \\"Brokeback Mountain\\".  I repect your opinion, to bad you can't respect mine.  Now that we're done with that, this movie sucks I only gave it 5 stars so you might actually read my review rather than ignore it.  This is my second review, because my first differed a little from popular opinion (not obscene or belittling, just not \\"5 stars\\", \\"Best Movie Ever!!\\")was magically erased...hooray for freedom of speech.  First off, why would anyone care what a straight asian man knows about gay cowboys, do you really think he knows what he's talking about?  Now let me start out by saying that I'm very open minded, I'm a straight, liberal, married man, I have many friends that are gay, and I think the gay public deserve all the same rights as any other race, religion, or creed.  Homosexual's are people just like anyone else, and whether they choose(I don't believe it's a choice)to be gay or not they are people who deserve to live a normal life just the same as you and me.  Now, let's get back to the movie, Brokeback Mountain is the most god awful disrespectful film, I think I've ever seen, but not for the reasons you might think. Ang Lee once again get's everything absolutely wrong(How you gonna make \\"The Hulk\\" into a drama?)and doesn't get one thing right.  The only people enjoying this film are people who've never or would ever have or had anything to do with a homosexual.  The homosexual public especially should be outraged by this film.  The film has such an unrealistic premise, it makes it to silly to even try to believe in these characters.  As far as this being a great love story, give me a break, if this were a story about a man and a woman no one would care but because it's involving a gay couple suddenly it's \\"The Greatest Love Story Of All Time!!!\\"  Give me a break, these men ignore their children and cheat on their wives, this is not a touching story.  Now you'll say \\"but this took place during a time where people couldn't be open about who they were\\".  Well whatever, I could still care less.  As far as the romance is concerned, if you like drunken sodomy(that's how all homosexual relationships start right), you'll love this movie.  Just one night in a tent next to a guy who's given you no prior hints that he might be gay, you(Of course not being gay yourself) roll over in the middle of the night and accidentally, violently, & analy rape each other.  That's where homosexual relationships come from according to Ang Lee.  It doesn't come from genuine love or sharing feelings with your partner, no just's Drunk BFing; and that's not offensive is it?  This movie was made by homophobes for homophobes period.  Besides this being as offensive as it is, it's extreeeemmmeeeellyy ssssslllllloooooowwwwwwww, and under Lee's direction gives you no reason to sit through the movie other than \\"does this movie get better?\\" questioning in your head.  Ya, maybe there is some nice pictures of the mountains, but is that really any reason to sit through this god awfully  offensively slow snooze-a-thon?  This movie is pure hype designed for me and you to sit and talk about how either good or bad it is so that around Oscar time it'll win it's awards.  2 years from now you won't hear a thing about it, and I hope to god it doesn't win any awards, that'll only cement the fact that the Oscars are even more meaningless(Gladiator was good but c'mon?)than I had already thought.  Everything about this movie is one big joke, there's not a thing special about the acting here(what, because Heathe Ledger can mumble he deserves an Oscar?).  If you truely want to watch a film about a love story that's truely award worthy watch \\"Walk The Line\\".  That's how true love should be visualised on film, \\"BBM\\" is just garbage.<br /><br />Ha! Ha! Ha!  Heath, Jake & Co. sure looked to be in low spirits at the end of Oscar night.  I can just hear what musta' been going through their heads \\"You mean I did that movie for nothing?\\"  Ha! Ha! SUCKERS!!!  Ya, sorry guys you still can't act, and just cause you can turn your aussie accent into a wanna be southern mumble doesn't mean you get an award.le he deserves an Oscar?).  If you truely want to watch a film about a love story that's truely award worthy watch \\"Walk The Line\\".  That's how true love should be visualised on film, \\"BBM\\" is just garbage.    Ha! Ha! Ha!  Heath, Jake & Co. sure looked to be in low spirits at the end of Oscar night.  I can just hear what musta' been going through their heads \\"You mean I did that movie for nothing?\\"  Ha! Ha!

0380002930|5.0|The primroses were over...and,...where the first primroses were beginning to bloom. The first and last sentences in a book that holds a magical place in my heart. As a child my mother belonged to a book club. She received this but could not get inside the idea of rabbits so she gave it to me to read. I was eight years old. For that, I am forever thankful...I have re-read this book probably a dozen times in the last 25 years and each time I am amazed by the story. I hope only that my infant daughter will grow to love it as much as I. I just bought her a new copy...
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This CD is really good, My favorites are \\"can't buy me love\\", \\"how sweet it is\\" and \\"home\\".  I love micheal buble, he has any amazing voice.  Definetly worth the money.
0385486804|5.0|Both of these books rest side by side on my bookshelf. As a young hyperbaric tech I had the honor of treating Dr. Weathers after his return stateside. My impression is that Mr. Krakauer was writing as a journalist, i.e. reporting on what he saw and what he experienced. Mr. Bourkeev, on the other hand, wrote his version as a tour guide. Yes, he is responsible for the saving of lives. He is, however, not immune to the responsibility of what happened. Mr. Krakauer was a journalistic participant in this tragedy and was paid to write what he saw and experienced. Mr. Bourkeev still does what led him to be a part of this tragedy. I pass this book out to all of my colleagues in Altitude Medicine courses BECAUSE it is written by an outside journalist. This is, by far, the greatest re-telling of a tragedy that I have ever read.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|Alright, you have got two hours and nothing to do then watch this movie. \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is kind of a movie I would want to like, but somewhere in between the story just looses the point. The cast was perfect, so was the acting by Keaton (looked dead dazzlingly beautiful) and Jack Nicholson. Don't ask about Keanu Reeves, anyone could have done that role (I am getting worried about his carrier now).<br /><br />Anyway, the story is good but somehow it's not been directed the way people will like it. After the half part of the movie, the story falls apart, and you actually wish it to end soon. Something like incomplete...it is like getting an automobile with some parts missing. I am giving three stars only for Diane Keaton, who made it worth to watch this movie.
B00008BXJF|5.0|This is the best King Crimson release in 25 years (Discipline). This disc is Fripp and Co. doing what they do best, which is to play unique and intriguing sonic landscapes (aka songs) in a most adventurous and bold style and manner. I personally liked only 1/2 of Thrak and was also similarly disappointed with Vroom, so I almost didn't buy this one...I almost missed out.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|It needs no introduction even to those who never watched it that \\"Friends\\" is the most popular daily sitcom of all times.  It is a story about six people living together and great friends. All are funny, successful and what they do professionally (except the funniest - Joey), looking for some love, fun, and companionship in their lives (Aren't we all?). The life that is full of challenges and changing relationships, only support and love of your friends can make it easy and sweet.<br /><br />One thing about this sitcom is that unlike other shows, you never get bored of watching them over and over again. That makes the best reason to buy this collector's set of all the ten seasons. I actually had the season 4 and 7 bought individually, but when I saw this Limited edition set, I just couldn't stop myself. Believe me, no point in buying seasons individually, just buy the whole set if you can and you will never regret it. The fun is when you watch the seasons back to back and you don't even realize that this sitcom was entertaining millions of people around the globe for a decade! That's the beauty of it. Having said that, I don't think paying $300 for this entire set is too much. It will entertain you for few more decades to come!
B0002X314C|5.0|From Marvin Gaye to Brian McKnight, some singers have an uncanny knack for showcasing that talent in a way that makes you appreciate not only what song they are singing but the soul and the person behind it. One of these singers is John Legend, who I call a legend in the making. With one album, Legend showcases a talent and vocal versatility that younger singers can only aspire to. \\"Ordinary People\\" is the highlight of this album and not since Lauryn Hill's \\"Ex-Factor\\" has an artist gone that deep when examining a relationship that is just not working. This album is on that you will enjoy years to come and only the start of what will surely be your John Legend collection of cds.
0060839872|5.0|1. You have an interest in philosophy but have been put off by the literature spawned by academia on the subject.  2. You are passionate about pursuing meaning/value/purpose/that which is good.  3. You are interested in high-level thinking about the world; theorizing that could hold everything in the world together, from art to science to religion to motorcycle repair.  4. You have problems with either science or art (i.e., \\"I'm not a science/art person\\"), and would like a bridge to understand or appreciate better the world of science or art.    I write this review primarily because I consider this the best book I have ever read, and it has made a profound and lasting change in the way I think about everything. That said, it's a fact that some people will like this book and some won't. Rather than speak to the relative merits of the thoughts Pirsig proposes (judged how exactly?), I write more to offer my thoughts on whether the book will speak to you.    There have been some rather hostile reviews of ZATAOMM from philosophic academia and from those who think it is over-hyped or just plain boring. As to the former, some have suggested that the book is so bad that it will forever ruin the mind of anyone interested in studying philosophy. Anecdotally, I read this book when I was 17 and proceeded to earn a philosophy degree with honors from an ivy league university. More generally, I question the motives and mindset of anyone who feels that mere words could forever ruin a person's intellect.     That said, it would be a waste of time to analyze this book from the analytical paradigm of American philosophical academia. If that's your perspective, more power to you, but don't read the book if you can't/don't want to suspend that mentality for a moment to consider an alternate mode of thinking. As to those who find it boring, that's another way of saying the ideas raised in the book don't speak to you. While I felt it was a pleasure to read, ZATAOMM isn't a masterpiece ofliterature; it lives and dies on its ideas.     Finally, over-hyping anything is dangerous, so while I obviously loved the book, I advise anyone reading it for the first time to read it with an open mind, with no expectations. Pick it up--you'll know in the first thirty pages if you'll like it.
068987474X|2.0|This book hasn't told me anything that experience and common sense hasn't. In fact, I didn't read past the first few pages because if women can't figure all this out for themselves, then their problem is not that they don't know a guy isn't intersted, they are in utter denial.  I was once naive and in denial in the dating world but I wised up and stop dealing with losers.  <br /> <br />The problem with women is not that we don't get it and need things explained to us. The problem is that women take the obvious and turn it into something it's not. When a guy makes excuses as to why he won't call, instead of taking the hint, we assume that what he is saying is true instead of realizing that he's only trying to avoid being the bad guy by not being honest and telling you that he's not really interested.  <br /> <br />Women are usually so deserpate that we try to put words in a guy's mouth and make things up in our head that he wants a relationship with us but have all these obstacles. For some women, even when a guy tells them directly that he's not interested, they still don't get it.  <br /> <br />If a guy is not calling, it's because he doesn't want to and it's really that simple. I don't need a book to tell me that a guy doesn't like me if he's not calling. I've already figured that out. <br /> <br />So ladies, what do you do if a guy doesn't call? Write him off and stop over-analyzing things and wasting emotional energy on men that are not actively pursuing you.  <br /> <br />Women need to stop taking dating so seriously. When we meeet a guy, we are thinking of him as The One and he's usually just looking at us as a good time or something to do until he finds what he really wants. Women need to  date like men. Date only for fun without any end goal in mind and date more than one person at a time. Don't get emotionally attached to one guy. <br /> <br />What I've learned is this:  unless a guy has put a ring on your finger, he  is not serious about you. If he doesn'tcall, delete his number, his email and just write him off.  <br /> <br />These are the things that will let you know that a guy is not interested: <br /> <br />1) He doesn't call or doesn't call when he says he will. <br /> <br />2) He stands you up, cancels dates or always makes excuses as to why he can't spend time with you (i.e. work, some project or whatever) <br /> <br />3) He only wants to get together to have sex. <br /> <br />4) He never wants to take you out on dates or only wants to come your house or only wants you to come to his. <br /> <br />5) He does not have you around his friends or gives lame excuses as to why people can't know you are dating (he's usually seeing someone else if he tells you that.) <br /> <br />6) He doesn't call you on your birthday or holidays or doesn't makes plans with you during those times. If he doesn't you are not his girlfriend or he is not considering you for a girlfriend. <br /> <br />Also when you are dating a guy and from the beginning he says to you, \\"Let's just go with the flow\\" or \\"Let's just see where things go,\\"  that also means he's not interested. <br /> <br />All of this I learned from experience, not from this or any other dating book. The bottom line is, if a guy is not calling or doing the things you'd expect the guy you are dating to be doing, he is not serious about you and is only using you or attempting to use for sex. Men know from the beginning if they are serious about you or not. If women would develop some diginity and self-respect and self-esteem, we would not keep spending our money on books and therapy to figure out what is obvious. <br /> <br />Go by a man's actions, not some fantasy you've made up in your own head.  You don't need a book to tell you any of this.   <br />
B00005MP58|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best adaptation of a book ever made into film.  EVERYTHING (acting, sets, scenery, costumes,music, etc) about this movie was excellent!!!  It just doesn't get much better than this.    A friend invited me over to watch this movie several years ago and as soon as I got home that night, I ordered the movie for myself.  It has all the key elements that I look for in a good movie:  great acting, likeable characters, romance, humor and of course a happy ending.       This adaptation is amazingly accurate to the book and I loved the fact that so much of the dialogue came straight from the book.     The acting was superb!!  Colin Firth IS Mr Darcy and Jennifer Ehle was wonderful as Elizabeth.  I especially loved to watch their facial expressions--so much of what they felt or thought came through in their facial expressions alone.  The other actors were also top notch.  David Bamber was a perfect Mr Collins and it's hard not to love rest of the cast as well.    I have watched this movie more times than I can count and just about everyone that I recommend this movie to ends up loving it and buying their own copy.  If you love Jane Austen or other BBC/A&E productions, you will love this movie too.  I highly recommend it.
B0001XAPZ6|3.0|'Nausica of the Valley of the Wind' is a curious movie - it's got all the elements of a true animated classic - great storyline, lovable heroine, scary monsters, and so forth - and it's got more than enough clever parallels and morals to make this one enjoyable on an adult level, too - expounding on the virtues and evils of things like environmentalism, war, forgiveness and xenophobia - but all in all, it doesn't really manage to capture the imagination in the way that Miyazaki's later classics 'Spirited Away' and 'Porco Rosso' did. <br /> <br />To synopsise the plot, briefly: in the distant future, man is reduced to living out a bare sort of existence on the outskirts of the deadly, creature-spawning Toxic Forest. Nausicaa, a princess of the Valley of the Wind, is suddenly caught up in a war between neighbouring kingdoms to gain control of the ultimate weapon to destroy the forest - which, she discovers, is helping, not hindering, man's progress.  <br /> <br />I didn't watch the English dub on this DVD, so I can only assume that the vocal talents of high-calibre actors such as Uma Thurman and Patrick Stewart are, as dubs go, top-notch. I prefer to immerse myself in the original, as-intended-by-the-creators atmosphere of the movie, and so, in Japanese, the characters in Nausicaa come across as a relatively run-of-the-mill bunch - beautiful young heroines sound like beautiful young heroines, sychopahantic bad guys sound like sychopahantic bad guys and grizzled old ladies sound like - that's right! - grizzled old ladies. On the whole, it's a likeable, if somewhat perfunctory, audio atmosphere, and the 80's synth score is, sadly, a little flat by today's standards. <br /> <br />Animation-wise, while not in the same league as 'Spirited Away', 'Nausicaa' is still a jaw-droppingly beautiful thing to look at, and must have been doubly so on its initial release. The imagination and innovation contained in the designs of the characters, weaponry and surroundings is matchedonly by the sense of awe we feel in witnessing the simplicity and elegance of these moving pictures. As with any good hand-drawn animation, this is like watching poetry - a fluid and absorbing sense of movement and rhythm, thrown into high relief by our appreciation of the fact that someone had to all this by hand. <br /> <br />This 'mixed-bag' feeling of the audio/visuals is played out, too, in the storyline. Yes, it's got a universal appeal, in that both adults and children will be able to appreciate and learn from the plot - more recently, cross-generational entertainment like the Harry Potter books and the Lord of the Rings movies supply the same thing - but here, I can't help wondering if the story could retain the interest of the casual viewer long enough for those lessons to be learned. While the 'Warriors of the Wind' cut of this movie stank, I must admit that there were points in 'Nausicaa' where I found myself wishing for the pace to pick up, or for a new set of circumstances to look at. It's an oddly-paced movie - the action sequences at the beginning of the film, though event-laden, are slow-moving enough to almost (but not quite!) approach dullness.  <br /> <br />But for all of that, please don't think 'Nausicaa' is a bad movie, because it isn't, and far from it. It's an elegant, beautiful-looking piece of animated cinema with some elements of sound and situation that, unfortunately, don't match the quality of those set down in later Ghibli productions. <br /> <br />But it comes with my recommendation, just the same.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Haven't heard much from this band lately, and I bought this album about a year and a half ago. Okay, so it's whiny and the music isn't all that talented. But it brought me from the pop world over into the rock one. I think they could do without all the rapping, and the lyrics could be a little less whiny. But Chester was molested as a child, and I guess that's why he writes such depressing and self-pitiful lyrics. I really don't see what the big problem with this album is though. It's catchy, and so catchy that I listened to it for months straight, and now I can't stand to listen to it anymore. Those who are critical and only listen to extremely talented musicians won't like this, but if you're trying to get someone you know into the rock genre, I'd lend them this CD.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This musical is amazing. The leads, Idina and Kristin, are both amazing and the story is amazing. You have to beyond the catchy tunes and listen to the lyrics closely and how it is sung to fully grasp the emotion (and fun!) in this musical. It is simply amazing and hopefully will run on Broadway for a long, long time!<br /><br />Also, go see the show if it travels near you!! Go to [...] to see when it's coming by!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Is awesome, better than I remember when it first came out and I viewed it.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Blue Racer: Green Day call themselves punks, they are a boy band with instruments. Japanese Beetle: That hermaphrodite Billie Jo should be karate chopped for trashing GW Bush, HAASAH! Blue Racer: Songs like Boulevard of Broken Dream, Wake Me Up When September Ends and the title cut are so bad. Japanese Beetle: That Billie Jo thinks he is English when he is an American. Avoid and buy London Calling, sayonara!
B0001M0A4I|5.0|I concur with the other positive, masterfully written reviews I've read here, and won't bother addressing the detractors, so I'll be brief. I'm trying not to wear this album out by repeat-listening (especially 1st thing in the morning)... so please, Tony, write more symphonic music! If you composed 12 more suites, I'd order them all sound-unheard. If that sounds like I'm not picky or lack dynamic tastes, you'd be mistaken. I listen to music that ranges from light to dark - baroque to 20th Century - fusion to prog - serene to bombastic. After a few listens, it became apparent that Seven would become a staple in my collection - something I'll listen to for the rest of my life. Tony Banks is truly gifted, and someone I've followed since '77.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Blue Racer: Mariah Carey is one ugly tramp and only came back as her label people paid radio to play her but the great U2 upstaged her. Japanese Beetle: Serpent son, this woman makes Yoko Ono look like one talented woman and if I saw Mariah I'd karate chop her. Blue Racer: I hate every song like Don't Forget About Us, We Belong Together and It's Like That. Japanese Beetle: I would chop her up LIKE THAT, HAASAH(chops Mariah CD in half and bows). Sayonara!
B0007PAMR4|3.0|Well, like many Dune fans I had been awaiting this release for quite some time, especially since it was to include deleted scenes!When it finally arrived I was of two minds about it. <br />On one hand I love the box art work, my only gripe is that the box is metal and so the artwork could get scraped very easily if you weren't careful. I did enjoy the deleted scenes although the only scene I really wanted to see was Thufirs death scene which was cut from the original movie for some outlandish reason, and wasn't even filmed for the sci fi channel version! Then there are the documentaries about special fx, costumes etc. These were very interesting although they are only a few minutes long, surely with a movie as huge as dune the documentaries could have lasted a little longer? <br />And then, on the other hand...I have the tv version on dvd, I bought the special edition on dvd, so I already owned 75% of the content of the extended edition but still paid $20+ for a few deleted scenes and documentaries. I have the feeling that somewhere not too far down the line they will release an uncut version including all of the deleted scenes cut into the movie, and that will be yet another version of dune. One can't help but feel that this extended edition was a wasted opportunity. They had the chance to release the movie in its entirity and blew it. <br />If you already own a version of dune on dvd then it really isn't worth buying this for a few deleted scenes and documentaries, you're better to hedge your bets and wait for a super mega fantastic delux uncut version to be released, and even then the next special edition is just around the corner. Universal, stop ripping us off!
0805076476|5.0|To start, I want to quote something Tyler says in the movie version of Fight Club. \\"F*ck what you know. You need to forget about what you know, that's your problem. Forget about what you think you know -- about life, about friendship, and especially about you and me.\\" He could've been talking about this book. <br /> <br />Since I watched the movie, like everyone else here, I was hooked. I was hesitant on getting the book for fear that it might spoil my experience with the movie but after reading the reviews here, I decided to go for it and guess what, it was worth it. I won't go into the story as I'm sure everyone who's on this page is here after being blown away with the movie. But I will explain the book's similarities and differences with the movie. <br /> <br />The movie is VERY true to the book. Most lines are from the book although in slightly different words. Reading the book, it brings the scenes from the movie very clearly to my mind. I can picture what's happening. Chuck Palahniuk has a gift with words. Almost the whole book is quotable. It has the same irony and dark humor as we saw in the movie. Yet, the experience seems different. Maybe because we're reading it, we get a better grasp of what the writer was trying to portray at the time. I mean, this WAS the beginning guys. It does justice to read the material that such an influential movie was based on. There's also a different ending, not quite what we saw in the movie. But don't worry, it doesn't change a thing. It's still as smooth and as disturbing as expected. <br /> <br />In short, if you're a fan of the movie, you HAVE to get the book. Being in Malaysia, I scoured high and low, for months before I finally found a shop carrying this book. Bought it, finished it the same day and have since, read it about half a dozen times. Truly a modern-day classic. Highly recommended.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Greenday has always been one of those mainstream success stories but this goes entirely overboard. They're trying to be \\"hip\\" and \\"cool\\" so now they try to write more complex songs. Sorry guys you don't have enough talent. They seem to have noticed that pussy punk was on it's way out so they all transformed in emo goths and then threw on a political mask.     Most of you kids never heard them in their prime so you think this trash is terrific. They were much better a decade ago. This album is polished and predictable sort of like everything these days. The addition of a second guitar did not help either. They should have hired someone who was remotely talented. I'm almost scared to see what they do next. Disco country? Who knows. But I know one thing. It's gonna suck.    Ohh and by the way you may have noticed I gave this album five stars. This was only so you'd actually read the review. Sheep.
0060736267|5.0|Betty Smith (1896-1972) wrote an American classic which became a huge bestseller in World War II America. The book was later made into a fine film.<br /><br />  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a novel dealing with the coming of age of a young Irish girl Francie Nolan. Francie grows up in poverty in Brooklyn. Her mother is hardworking and favors Francie's brother Neely, Her Irish father is a singing waiter who drinks himself to death in his early 30s. Francie's school is grim and life in Brooklyn in the early 1900s is a constant struggle for survival to the impoverished residents of this most colorful of New York's boroughs.<br /><br />  Smith takes these ingredients and mixes them into a potent stew of heartwarming tales concerning Francie, her friends and her family,<br /><br />  The book is no sentimental slow boat to a halcyon past of childhood memories. Smith tells her tale in a matter of fact<br /><br />non-maudlin way. Her style is simple but profound. Author Smith uses simple words to convey the joys and sorrows, tragedies and small triumphs experienced by a poor family in a poor locale.<br /><br />  Everyone who wants to read a very accessible touching classic should read this excellent novel of a young girl and her dreams and daily life.<br /><br />  I devoured this book in two days as I was transported back in time to the Brooklyn of the early 20th century entering into the tenement home of the Nolans. It is a trip I recommend for you to read!<br /><br />  The Perennial edition contains a short biography of Betty Smith including a reminiscence by her daughter.<br /><br />  A beautiful, enduring classic of American prose!
B000AP2ZDK|4.0|It's kind of hard to mess up an instrumental album because, unless your beats are wack, there's pretty much very little margin for error.  I think we all know that Jay Dee (aka J Dilla) doesn't make wack beats, so you pretty much know what to expect when you get this album.  Let me tell ya, Dilla does indeed meet expectations.  There are some real bangin' beats on this album.  The first real standout to me was \\"Stop!\\", but it isn't the last.  The album has 31 cuts and they all average out to about a minute and a half each with \\"Workinonit\\" being the longest (2:57) and \\"\\"Donuts (Outro)\\" being the shortest (0:12).  Kind of like Madvillainy or that last Count Bass D joint (Begborrowsteel), but without the rapping.<br /><br />So why four stars instead of 5?  Well, the album does start out kind of slow with a passable (not wack) song here or there (\\"Waves\\" as well as a few others).  Also, some of the tightest beats on the album are also some of the shortest (\\"The New\\" & \\"Stepson Of The Clapper\\").  Aside from those minor hiccups, the album is free of blemishes.<br /><br />Despite a few passable cuts, Donuts is still a fine, fine release from J. Dilla.  We all know the man can make beats, it's just a matter of execution and Jay Dee executes on this album perfectly.  I think this would make an excellent addition to any music library and I recommend picking it up.  Two thumbs up.<br /><br />Standout Tracks: Two Can Win, Time: The Donuts Of The Heart, Stop! (My Favorite), Don't Cry, Stepson Of The Clapper, The Diff'rence, The Twister (Huh, What), Geek Down, and People<br /><br />Norfeest aka One Man's Opinion<br /><br />Feb. 10th Update:  Just found out that J. Dilla (ne' James Yancey) has passed away.  The world of hip hop has just suffered a huge loss.  May all of our prayers be with his family and close friends.  Rest in peace bro, you'll most certainly be missed.
B00082IJ08|1.0|Skip this and pick up Wintersun instead.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|I just want to point out that when playing this album the song that jumps out as the best track is Queen Jane. Don't tell anyone this little known secret. MAN ALIVE that guy can sing. Is dylan a good singer? This is not like asking if the pope is a catholic; it is more akin to asking if Picasso was a good painter or maybe wondering if the night sky is pretty. Is he a good lyricist? Different question but dylan's vocals are the best thing about this record.
B0006VU3ZA|1.0|This is a bootleg album, not an official release. Made in an European country and sold here pretending to be the real thing. It has a bar code and everyting, these bootlegers just keep getting smarter, ha? DONT BUY THIS THING.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|G.K. Chesterton's wrote, \\"For the great Gaels of Ireland, Are the men that God made mad, For all their wars are merry, And all their songs are sad.\\"  My favorite, \\"If I Could Be Where You Are\\" abundantly validates those words. The music is poignant food for the Celtic soul.  The Loxian should have been reserved for her own full length, Lord of the Rings' CD.  Perhaps Gaelic Enya and her lyricist Roma Ryan are best understood by other Gaelic souls.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This record ROCKS!!!  I first heard of UFO in the winter of 1980 while staying with my sister and her husband in Hawaii.  I guess I was about fourteen at the time and I discovered that  FM radio out there was really killer...and I grew up within range of  the late lamented WNEW 102.7 in NYC.  Anyway, the local Honolulu (is that right? station kept playing \\"Only you can rock me\\" and from the first note, I was hooked.  I was always a big fan of live albums, so when I returned to my home in New Jersey (just down the road from Asbury Park...adopted home of \\"you-know-who\\"), I immediately bought \\"Strangers...\\"  Shenker's guitar sound is the best.  Clean Gibson Humbuckers through a Marshall Stack, with just a hint of cry-baby wah wah to keep things interesting.  \\"only you can rock me\\"...well, rocks me.  \\"Doctor Doctor\\" \\"Mother Mary\\" \\"Natural Thing\\" all sound even better than the studio cuts...and the studio cuts are pretty tough to beat.  I would put UFO up against any \\"rock\\" band (with one or two exceptions) on the radio now and they'd kick butt.  Heck, UFO with Paul \\"Tonka\\" Chapman after Schenker flamed out was pretty cool as well.  Check out Mechanics to see for yourself.  But \\"Strangers\\" is best on my headphones REALLY LOUD in the gym. <br />Cheers, <br /> <br />Bob (An Old Geezer)
158799190X|2.0|This book is comprised of the author's musings on the subject of randomness.  Taleb is an academic/classicist type who is embarrassed to be a trader.  He brags about not watching TV, reading newspapers or engaging in small talk, and refers to himself in the book as an \\"intellectual snob\\".    The problem with \\"intellectual snobs\\" is that they have an exaggerated opinion of the importance of their thoughts, lapsing into verbose tangents discussing meaningless minutiae.  As a consequence, the author spends 200 pages discussing a topic that could be condensed into a few paragraphs.  In fact, I will save you the time and effort by providing you with those paragraphs.    Our minds are not wired to think well in the mathematics of probability, and often times ascribe meaning to events that are actually random.    Funds, traders and investors often believe themselves to be experts as a result of a run of good results, when in actuality those runs were the result of randomness.  For example, during the 90's many traders and investors who went long in tech stocks thought they were experts (everyone's an expert on the way up), only to find out during the subsequent crash that they were not qualified to detect major market turns, and lacked the skills and discipline to utilize trailing stops (the laws of probability dictate that every once in a rare while there will be a long run of almost uninterrupted price appreciation).  The book discusses several similar examples where traders and funds blew up because they didn't properly understand the risks and became married to positions, even after those positions started crashing.      That's pretty much it.  The critical point it is that all of the trading dangers discussed by the author can be completely avoided by extensively testing your system to verify that it has a true statistical edge, rather than just being an artifact of random noise, and employing standard trading rules: always use appropriate stops, never average down, don't get married to a position, be flexible enough to reverse your position in a heartbeat, etc.    Now that wasn't so hard, was it, Taleb?
B000ASATWQ|5.0|While very few would ever question the greatness of Bob, his youngest son Damian arguably still has a lot of work to do to reach such legendary status. This album certainly goes a long way towards proving that Damian is one of the premiere reggae artists of this generation. This album is a proper mix of classic, roots-oriented, soulful reggae with the modern hip-hop oriented reggae that currently pervades the genre.  <br />Welcome to Jamrock starts out strong with \\"Confrontation,\\" a political song throughout which resonates the political ideals made famous by father Bob. Though the content reflects the modern political climate, Damiam certainly seems to view the world through the same lense that his father did. \\"Welcome to Jamrock,\\" \\"We're Gonna Make It,\\" and \\"Khaki Suit\\" (among others) certainly capture the dancehall crowd. \\"Move\\" follows Damian's trend of borrowing melodies and lyrics from Bob, as the melody and lyrics of \\"Exodus\\" flow throughout the song. \\"For the Babies\\" is a great song (if you can get past the distortion effect on Jr. Gong's voice) which portrays the pain and anguish caused by dysfunctional families (something I can definitely relate to, as many of us can). The song mixes in enough words of praise and hope to keep it from reaching a depressing level, though. Other notable songs include \\"Pimpa's Paradise\\" (featuring Black Thought of The Roots) and \\"Road to Zion (featuring Nas). These are my favorite songs from this classic album, and if you're into meaningful tracks, then these songs will hit a vein with you. <br />In all, Damiam creates his best album to date, and he mixes well tunes of the old with rhythms of the new. Further, he mixes soulful, meaningful songs with classic dancehall rhythms. Because of this mix, Damian should effectively increase his fanbase and establish his diversity as an excellent artist. While I don't think he is yet near the \\"legendary\\" status, this album takes an honest stab at it. With a few more albums at the same level, Damian will have effectively reached that level. <br />If you enjoy the type of music described above, I would recommend that you not hesitate to purchase this album.
B00009MGQL|5.0|I've been a Jeff Beck fan for thirty years (wow, I'm getting old), and this is my favorite thing he's ever done. I read his interview in Guitar player back in 2003, and when asked what it was like making his new album, he said \\"I hated it more than anything I've ever done\\". I was bummed out after reading that, so I didn't buy the CD until 2006. Man what a shock! This is the freshest most exciting thing I've ever heard. I guess he was just tired of working on it because of the tediousness of working with computers. He also made the comment \\"this is the last time I ever make a record with a mouse\\". Jeff is over 60 but sounds as young and talented as any guitarist on the planet. This CD is a MUST have! Every track absolutely SMOKES!
B00005JNRE|5.0|In the past few years, it seems like all of the movies that are safe to take young children to are computer generated animation films full of adult humor.  The kids are entertained by the animation - the parents by the adult humor.  \\"Nanny McPhee\\" thankfully breaks the mold with a sweet story for everyone in the theater.  Children identify with the young actors in the film and the story never drags.  The six-year old who accompanied me is usually one who loves action cartoons, killing, shooting, etc.  When we left the theater he said, \\"That's the best movie I ever saw!\\"  Thanks, Ms. Thompson, for reminding us about what children SHOULD be watching at the movies!
0060763280|2.0|Yes, there are some thought-provoking ideas about why some people are not wealthy and others are. Yes, the rich think differently about wealth. (Hence the rating of two stars as opposed to one.) <br /> <br />The book offers rather nebulous strategies in wealth growth, but   without any concrete suggestions. Those nuggets are teasingly alluded to, but promised in Mr Eker's seminars. And from the examples in the book, during the first seminar, you will be hounded to attend the next..and the next...and the next, all the while contributing to Mr Eker's coffers. <br /> <br />I walked away with the impression that the main purpose of this book is to pitch the seminars, and the author does so with the fervour of a used car salesman. I have already contributed to Mr Eker's net worth by buying this book. I would hate to insult my intelligence by contributing further by going to one of the seminars.
0975991477|5.0|The book Biology of Belief by Dr. Bruce Lipton is one of those great books that you just have to read.  Lipton succesffully and seamlessly combines ancient mystical wisdom and cutting edge scientific discoveries.  He bridges what many consider to be the scientific/spiritual gap.   <br /> <br />The book also builds on a whole area of spiritual thought concerning the power of intention, which by the way happens to be the title of another great book written by Dr. Wayne Dyer.  The main premise of intention is: that which we intend for ourselves is that which is made manifest in our lives and our intentions are built upon our thoughts, our words and our actions.  While Dyer reaches his conclusions about intention while on a spiritual path, we see that Lipton is on a similar path of discovery but one based on science. <br /> <br />In the end you realize that what we believe, and in essence our intentions are based on what we believe, is what you will create in your life.  Your thoughts are the energy that makes everything in your life happen.  Not only can negative thoughts impact your mind, and weigh heavily on your spirit but they can even damage your physical body.  Is it any wonder that the person who constanctly attacks themselves with thoughts of self hatred develop illnesses and conditions that attack the body like cancer or autoimmune disorders.  While many people knew this to be true based on spiritual teachings, now we have the scientific proof to back it up even more. <br /> <br />Read this book, it may justhelp you to change what you believe and in turn change what you create for yourself.

B0006L16N8|4.0|This is a really good CD by the English band Coldplay. Above all the other songs for me is the wonderful Fix You, which is a simple but beautiful song that offers solace to anyone in emotional pain. I think this is one of the best songs that I have heard by anyone so far this decade, and it was my favourite song of 2005. What If is also a fine song with a memorable chorus, while Swallowed In The Sea was also a very good song. Speed Of Sound was a big hit and an award-winning single in mid-2005, while I also liked Twisted Logic, the guitar/folk bonus track , and The Hardest Part ( which I think could also make a good single choice with its catchy melody) .  <br /> <br />Overall, X&Y is a fine and well-produced album that has already sold very well. I have been continuing to listen to it in 2006, and I highly recommend it to any music fans who may not have heard it yet. It is very nearly as good as Coldplay's previous CD A Rush Of Blood To The Head , which is saying a lot.  <br /> <br />4 and a half stars.
B0006399FS|4.0|Great album. I'm one of the U2 fans that abandoned the band after POP, but after listening to this album, i'm proud to be a U2 fan once again. Highlights : Love and Peace or Else & Miracle Drug    And to all those that gave it one star. Come on, One star? Maybe if you would have given it 2 stars the score would be believable, but one? Have you even heard the album? Or did you turn it off when you noticed this wasn't The Joshua Tree #2.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|The blurb on the front of the DVD case says all you need to know.  \\"A smash hit romantic comedy, with zombies.\\"  Really, what more do you need to hear.<br /><br />Many people mistakenly think this is a spoof movie or a parody of Dawn of the Dead, the remake of which came out unfortunatally close to the release of Shaun (I think there's even a Shaun trailer on the Dawn DVD) and the names are similar, but this is not the case.  Shaun of the Dead is a great zombie movie in its own right and nails both the horror and the comedy.<br /><br />The comedy in the film is so slick you may have to watch multiple times to catch it all.  It is that almost dry but witty British humor that when done right can be ten times as funny as the loud in your face humor we get in the states.  You need to listen to all the quips from Shaun's loser buddy Ed (who has an excellen loser gap cut into his hair.  Just something you have to notice to realize how funny that is) pay attention to all the back ground action (was that couple making out or was she just eating his neck?) and watch closly to get all the cool little jokes.  Don't worry there are still some nice fall down humor and inappropriate words to giggle at.<br /><br />You can see the love of the zombie films these film makers have and the layers they use to tell their story is amazing.  In a pair of inventive scenes we see Shuan walking down the street like a zombie himself to the store not noticing the world around him because he just does not care.  Later we see him on the same walk, this time not noticing anything because he's thinking about sorting his life out and not noticing that a zombie invasion is begining around him (another great background scene by the way). Also inventive is the use of foreshadowing.  Notice when Ed says they should drink all day tomorrow starting with a bloody mary and ending up at the pub that this is what happens... kind of.  Notice the name tag of the first zombie they bloody up and where they end up at the end of the day.  Or there is the more obvious, \\"The next time I see him he's dead,\\" comment from Ed.<br /><br />There's a whole slew of this kind of thing along with the fact its a great comedy and horror (don't believe me?  Well don't be eating spaghetti near the end of the film is all I have to say) and I could go on way longer than needed.  Check it out.  If you like intelligent comedies or zombies or hey, there's a romance plot in there too, then you'll love this.hey end up at the end of the day.

B000BT97AO|5.0|Going in to see this movie, I had absolutely no expectations. All I knew about this movie was that it was written by one of my favorite writers, Neil Gaiman.<br /><br />Now, every kids dream is to run off to the circus, right? Well, this story is the complete opposite. This is a story of a young girl, Helena, who wants to get away from the circus that her parents run and just live a normal life. Frustrated by her situation, she has an argument with her mother and basically blurts out that she wishes her mother were dead. Well, that very night just before her performance, her mother collapses and is rushed to the E.R. At the hospital her mother is diagnosed with a brain tumor (presumably) of which she will need prompt surgery for. Naturally, Helena is consumed with guilt and blames herself for the situation.<br /><br />That night, Helena falls asleep and has the most bizarre and intricate dream a young girl can have. The thing is, for the most part she knows she's having a dream the whole time, so she's actually able to control some of the situations that happen. It's not like Alice in Wonderland where Alice is oblivious to the fact that she is indeed dreaming the whole time.  The most amazing thing about this film is it totally makes you feel like you are in her dream with her. Nothing makes sense in the dream world she's in, just like nothing does in real dreams. The whole dream she is having is very symbolic. Helena (in the real world) is very artistic and imaginative and her drawings transfer over to her dream making up the scenery. In her dream, she must combat `the dark side' or the Bad Helena. Bad Helena is essentially in the real world while Good Helena is trapped in the dream world. Bad Helena is loosing her innocence and purity of childhood. She acts out, dresses punk, has boys in her room, and is basically rebelling. Bad Helena's final connection to her childhood is to rip up all her drawings, which is actually the keyhole to the dream world that Good Helena is in. Good Helena needs to figure out a way to stop her in time.<br /><br />The visuals in the movie are just amazing. Naturally, this movie did not get rave reviews by the critics. It's very artistic with a bit of a meddled plot. The thing is, to me that's how it should be. Who has ever woken up from a dream saying `that dream made complete and perfect sense to me'. No. People always wake up from dreams saying `I just had the weirdest dream'. Dreams aren't supposed to make sense. This is a movie about a dream, so to me, it shouldn't make perfect sense.<br /><br />This will be one of those cult classics that may be an aquired taste.d Helena is in.

Layne has such an great voice, he was one of a kind...at least they managed to put together 4 solid albums before his death.  Great Album, Go Pick it up!
B0007Y08QA|3.0|WARNING: possible spoilers ahead...<br /><br />With the Machinist, director Brad Anderson has created a love sonnet to Hitchcock. If the fact that it has Christian Bale in it rather than Jimmy Stewart throws you off the scent, all you have to do is listen to the music. The soundtrack to the Machinist sounds like Bernard Herman's greatest hits. This purposeful tip of the hat to Hitchcock, and Christian Bale's immersive portrayal of a man who is slowly losing his mind make the Machinist worth watching, despite the fact that it boasts one of my least favorite twist endings.<br /><br />Bale plays a tortured man who hasn't been able to sleep for a year. The cause of his insomnia is unknown, but it's taking a toll on his health. To say that he's lost a lot of weight is an understatement. Bale is positively skeletal in this movie. As he struggles to maintain his sanity and keep his job at the machine shop, Bale tries desperately to understand why he can't sleep.<br /><br />Things take a turn for the worst when Bale meets the new guy at work. He's a bald-headed, leering man who lost his hand in some kind of unfortunate circumstance, and now has two of his toes sewed on his hand in place of fingers. This guy has a weird way of showing up just when something bad is going to happen, and pretty soon Bale thinks that Baldy has got it in for him. If you've seen SECRET WINDOW, HAUTE TENSION or even HIDE AND SEEK, the big twist of this movie will come as no surprise. Typically, I think this revelation is overused and cheap, which is the only reason that I didn't give this movie a higher rating, but at least the Machinist is done with some style.<br /><br />Taking into account the undeniable Hitchcock style that Brad Anderson gave this movie, and the remarkable acting from everyone involved, especially Christian Bale, I would recommend this movie to horror fans who are interested in thrillers that move a little slower but are thick with atmosphere. The ending is a bit of a letdown, but as with HAUTE TENSION, the telling of the tale justifies at least one viewing.telling of the tale justifies at least one viewing.
B0006399FS|5.0|I've listened to this album consistently for over a year, and am impressed by how well it holds up. Every song has a strong character and unique identity, ranging from hard rock to ballad. I'm personally convinced that this belongs in the top tier of U2 albums, along with Boy, Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby. It is different from each of those earlier albums, and they're all different from one other - but it's part of the greatness of U2 that they can succeed in very different ways. The fact that U2 can put out an album of such high quality 25 years after their debut album is both stunning and nearly unprecedented in the history of rock music. It is terrific that this achievement was recognized by a Grammy. <br /> <br />Ignore the naysayers. Listen to a great album and enjoy it.
B0007PAMBK|4.0|The tagline reads Is there death after life? The movie is a weird tale of the unnatural and it will haunt you.<br /><br />Mary is out enjoying a ride with two friends. The women accept a challenge to a drag and are forced off of a bridge. It appears that all are drowned, until quite some time later Mary amazingly emerges from the river. Three days later Mary accepts a job in a new town as a church organist. On her way there she begins to be stalked by a mysterious phantom figure that seems to reside in an old abandoned carnival. It is here that Mary must confront the personal demons of her spiritual indifference.<br /><br />This movie will take you on a surreal supernatural journey into the afterlife. One can't help but wonder if this film was a major influence for 'Final Destination'. This film is a great classic and worthy viewing for fans of the genre. FYI Sidney Berger who played John Linden would go on to star in 1998's Wes Craven Presents 'Carnival of Souls' as a Cop. This was not a remake and shared only the same title.
0307276902|1.0|I tried reading this book in its entirety.  I developed a headache after only a few chapters.  I could look over the fact that his grammar is like a child's if his stories were completely true.  I do enjoy a good \\"truth is stranger than fiction\\" story.  But let's face it.  His stories were mostly fabricated and his writing style is that of staccato rambling.  I'm moving on to a better book already.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I thought I had seen great films in the past, but this film stands alone in its greatness.  Witnessing this film is an experience that cannot be explained.  It pulls you in, and you think back on it for days after you see it.  I saw it twice in the theatres, and I will most definitely add the DVD to my collection.  Ang Lee and the superb actors who brought this story to life will surely be remembered as pioneers and exceptional artists for many decades to come.  I hope you win every Oscar nomination.
B00004SZWD|5.0|This is the One. This is one of the greatest albums ever made.<br /><br />This is a rich masterpiece, equivalent of Beethoven Symphony number 3. In the 1970's, American Cinema went thru a renaissance of masterful films. American music did not follow as well (in my opinion)... But then you listen to this gem.<br /><br />EVERY SONG is wonderful. Every song has a message delivered with fantastic funk, rhythm, harmony and lyrics. And what a great name for the album, Songs in the Key of Life, indeed. This is the music I want my children to know. This is the chocolate for your ear, mind and soul.<br /><br />A

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Dario Marianelli's score is sumptuous. I've seen the film 16 times, and counting. My favorite is the Meryton Townhall, then Leaving Netherfield, and also, track 17: Credits. Many people leave the movie theatre during the credits and miss this beautiful piece. I have a solid two-hour heavy traffic commute to work every day. I used to listen to traffic reports, news, and C-span. By the time I got to the office, I was a nervous wreck. Now I listen to this score and I forget that I'm stuck in traffic. I get to work relaxed and cheerful. This score is nominated for an Oscar, and I really hope it wins.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Rent takes up where \\"The band Played On\\" leaves off - living with AIDS instead of dying with it.

A film to laugh, cry, and sing with.

B00005JOII|4.0|Match Point is an angst-filled movie full of interesting characters who are very human.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is Chris Wilton, a tennis instructor who has yet to find a direction in life.  A former tennis pro, he was not satisfied being in the spotlight.  At the beginning of the film, Chris meets Tom Hewett, a student who is close to him in age, and they discover a common interest in opera.  Chris attends an opera with Tom and his family.  There he takes an interest in Chloe (Emily Mortimer), Tom's younger sister.  He becomes engaged to Chloe, and Chloe's father (Brian Cox) sets him up with a lucrative career.  Chris eventually becomes obsessed with Tom's girlfriend Nola (Scarlett Johansen), with whom he begins an affair.  Their affair continues as he marries Chloe and attempts to have a baby.   <br /> <br />Match Point is tense, and very emotionally authentic.  The leads all have a great dynamic together, creating a terrific ensemble cast.  The only downfall is the resolution, which attempts a comic turn briefly before it simply ends, in a manner that feels unsatisfying.  Well worth seeing, though, in spite of that.  Final Grade: B
6305428050|5.0|Loved it , an absolute classic<br /><br />Elizabeth Shue gives an awesome performance, including the classic lip-sync in the opening scene. George Newbern is the 'knight in shining armor' - we could hardly believe when he was then the groom in 'Father of the Bride'. Penelope Ann Miller - another classic performance, great one liners. And you gotta love when Elizabeth Shue sings the blues! Also great performance by Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes in the frat house scene. Definitely one to make you smile!

Maybe that will be 14 years after...or later than that. <br /> <br />Pulse (Doctor...there's no pulse!) is just so disappointing by its absence. Amazon, EMI, Pink (gray) Floyd just aren't satisfying the fans. We are being played with. <br /> <br />All in all its just so disappointing. <br />

It's so relaxing and it has a lot of my favorite songs on here: Sound of Silence (an all time favorite), bleaker street, Feelin' Groovy, I am a Rock, Scarborough Fair/Canticle , Mrs. Robinson, the boxer and much more. It really picks up my moods when I get depressed.

I don't have a favorite part of the movie because all of it is fabulous.<br /><br />This movie shows the true depth of Patrick Swayze's acting! He is fabulous in this movie; Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo also did a very good job. This movie is primarily a comedy with some touching moments thrown in. A look at life from a different point of view. Well worth seeing more than once!!<br /><br />Also Recommended: Pirscilla Queen of the Desert, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Dirty Dancing, Grease

B00005JO1Y|5.0|I was always a fan of King Kong, I have both versions on my collection the 1933 and 1976.  After I saw the new version, I'm convinced this is the best version ever.  Full of magnificent visual effects, very convincing.  I don't understand the complains some pleople have about the dinosaurs scenes.  The original version (1933) had dinosaurs too, in comparison with the new ones, the originals are very weak and even then I found them very cheesy.  The new dino scenes are magnificent full of action and adrenaline, very convincing and they add a lot more to the plot, than simply action.  They make you comprehend that this is an isolated island were prehistoric life was preserved in all its essence.  This new version has more thought put into it.   The new version did not include the pterosaurs the original had.  Pterosaurs migrate like birds do today, even though the island was isolated, they could fly and find humans in some other places.  It was very smart to change them for bats.  At least some bats do not migrate.  In general the movie is excellent and interesting, there had been longer boring movies that had even won an oscar, so I don't find any problem with the lenght of this movie.  The only complain I have was the first 45 minutes of the movie that try to develope the characters of the story.  This sequences lack of interest once in a while and do not add anything to the plot, maybe some editing here could've lessen the bad scoring some people did.  Even though, I watched 3 times this movie and came to my house and watched again and again the original and the 1976 versions and now I can say for the first time that the remake of a movie improved upon the original version.  Very few times you can say that!!!! Desperate waiting for the release of the DVD
B0002Z9HT8|1.0|i recorded the live aid concert on vhs. & I mean i was up at six am to catch it when it started in australia. inxs was the bomb. & I would have bought this disc if they included \\"oz for africa' on it too. that was during the \\"listen like thieves\\" era (actually BEFORE the cd was released) not to mention a plethra of incredible talent all of which i'd love to have on dvd.& then to know that 85 other songs are missing from the dvd (of which i'm pretty sure i have on vhs still) it just kills me that someone sat down & decided what \\"the masses\\" would have liked to see. I'd be happier if someone just came out & said that they couldn't get the copyrights to the stuff. ok, i'm done with my ranting, thanks for the heads up. I won't be buying this until they include EVERYTHING damn it!
B00062ZE3U|5.0|I'll keep it simple.  This is the best metal-with-amazing-female-vocals CD out there!  If you're thinking of buying anything by Nightwish, Tristania, Epica, etc., buy Silent Force by Within Temptation instead!  Also, if you like incredible \\"epic\\" music like Coheed and Cambria, Mars Volta, etc., you must buy this CD. <br /> <br />Within Temptation has so much more going for it than these other bands.  The music is so much more complex and captivating than anything by these other bands, which often rely way too much on power chord Metallica style metal.  Within Temptation incorporates strings, flutes, keyboards, etc.  At the same time, this is not the slow paced experience that their previous CD, Mother Earth was.  (Personaly, I wouldn't even recommend Mother Earth to most.)  Every track on this CD is as captivating as the best of Nightwish, etc. <br /> <br />     Simply outstanding!
B00005JO1R|5.0|This movie is incredible, both Reese and Joaquin mold into their roles more and more as the movie goes on and by the second half you have to remind yourself that it really isn't Johnny and June.   From beginning to end you are treated to the heart of the characters and the musical performances outreached my wildest dreams.  The history of the era is demonstrated through the camaraderie of other up and rising musical greats of the time.  Their road trips together are classic and the portrayal of these personalities will make you laugh as you are treated to what seems like an endless streams of live concerts all across the United States. However, the most captivating and believable theme is the friendship and romance of June and Johnny.  As a friend she stood by him through the most down and out period of his life, his best friend and this movie excellently portrays her dedication to him as a person and how that understandably translates into his absolute adoration of her.  Extremely well done, I am looking forward to seeing it again.
B0002OERI0|5.0|You can listen to this CD straight through over and over again, and it will never disappoint. <br /> <br />I'm not a die-hard Green Day fan, but this album is full of great lyrics, accompanying music, and melody.  All of the musical elements work together.  It's NOT a guy shouting about how much he hates his life.  Read the lyrics, and feel the emotion.  It's social commentary.  It's really intelligent, not simply screaming.  Look at the lyrics to \\"Letterbomb\\" or \\"Homecoming\\".    It's things that everyone can understand, if they only listen. <br /> <br />The best song is definitely the \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\".  What they play on the radio are NOT the best songs.  The mix of music is diverse, from a calm \\"Give Me Novacaine\\" to a nostalgic \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" to the political \\"Letterbomb\\".  My personal favorite song would be \\"Are We the Waiting\\".  I associate with \\"She's a Rebel\\".  It's really hard to find a song that you don't like!  These songs go on in my head all day. <br /> <br />Through the progression of songs you follow characters like the Jesus of Suburbia, St. Jimmy, and Whatsername.  Some of the songs also transition seamlessly, like \\"Holiday\\" into \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams.\\"  It's so creative! <br /> <br />The warning on the back should read \\"Parental Advisory : Addictive Content\\".

B00005JOIF|3.0|One of the reviews posted here bashes the movie as tripe. Well, Spielberg has his style which you may like or not, but it doesn't degrade the substance of the story, perhaps only the form which, again, is a matter of preference and taste. The bottom line in this movie is that the eternal feud between the parties involved has no resolution in sight as long as the (meaningless) violence is a part of equation. The movie doesn't take sides, but just shows the futility of violence on both sides. That is why it has enraged both parties who criticized Spielberg heavily. In that respect, the movie hits the nail on the head, but of course should not be compared with another format, i.e. a documentary \\"On Day in September\\" which is a must see, and in a way complements this work of SS et al. I give it three stars for the idea, but Spielberg's commercal and somewhat routine execution is not my kind of a movie language.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Many people, myself included, much of the time, have unending disdain for popular taste.  Sometimes, however, something truly deserving works its way into the public consciousness.  The now massive popularity of 'The Shawshank Redemption' proves that the supposed biases of the typical film viewer aren't as set in stone as idiot executives and critics would have you believe.  This film is all about character and relationships, and it's rather long and has no action or sex appeal (no female characters at all, really) in it.  However, the strong human connection that is possible in film comes through here better than in just about any other film I've ever seen, and it seems like plenty of other people feel the same way.<br /><br />The film centers on two characters, Red and Andy Dufresne, both lifers, convicted murderers, in Shawshank prison.  These guys are played by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, respectively, and the two great actors give the best performances that I've seen from either of them.  No one else has too huge of a role, but everyone is certainly believable enough, and the minor characters have enough quirks and strange things about them to make them interesting with out turning them into caricatures. (Well Bob Gunton's Norton is perhaps a bit too villainous to be utterly believable, but it's just a little bit too much.)<br /><br />The direction is firm and not at all flashy, save for a few nice establishing shots designed to acquaint us with the prison.  I typically like my movies to be flashy, but that isn't necessary here, and would probably prove to be distracting.  The score is fairly conventional, but it's also very beautiful and haunting, and a perfect backdrop to the more significant scenes.<br /><br />Both critics and fans of the film accuse it of being 'slow', but I don't really agree.  This movie doesn't even really have a plot to it, and thus can't really be fast or slow.  It doesn't seem to be building to anything, though this impression is, of course, proven wrong.  This film is just about the characters' lives, and it's largely just a series of individual episodes narrated and commented on by Red's character where we learn about the mysterious, untouchable Andy and how his stoic character effects those around him.  Thus, pretty much every scene is important, in its way.<br /><br />It also deserves particular credit for the remarkably good adaptation.  The Stephen King novella that this is based on is good, but hardly transcendent.  It also covers a longer period of time and contains fairly few specific details and virtually no minor characters.  They manage to both condense and bolster the material, combining characters and creating new ones and just solidifying a tale that was remarkably formless and free flowing, all while remaining quite faithful to the source material.  Furthermore, the screenwriter had a particularly good eye for the most memorable lines of the novella and finds a way to include all of them in the film.<br /><br />Again, this is a film that relies on human interest and is fundamentally a feel-good kinda film, in spite of the fact that almost everything that happens in this film is bad.  Of course, this is probably why it works with so many people.  A film that talks about how wonderful life is unlikely to make anyone feel good about themselves if they think about it too much.  Thematically it is simple, just saying that happiness come form within, and how we have to find joy in little things and always cling to hope and so on.  Again, simple stuff, but absolutely true and I've never heard anything truly profound in a movie anyway.  The best you can hope for with thematic effect in a films comes from making you remember and believe what you already knew, again.  (Interestingly enough, the film in recent memory which  is most effective on this level is `28 Days Later'.  Lotsa people didn't seem to notice that, as that isn't what you're looking for in a horror movie, but it's thereif you want it, and makes that into a truly great film. I know I'm getting off topic, but I really like to promote that film.)<br /><br />Needless to say, there are gonna be plenty of people out there who are sufficiently cynical and that it won't be able to affect them, and the generally episode driven drama will probably be insufficient to hold your interest if you can't feel for the characters.  If you're this kinda person you need not bother with this film.  But, on the other hand, I'm a fairly bitter and cynical person myself, yet I love this movie and am moved by the more effective scenes every time even after about 10 or so viewings over a decade.  So you never know.<br /><br />Grade: Aa truly great film. I know I'm getting off topic, but I really like to promote that film.)

B000AXSN5G|4.0|Prairie Wind is a very good cd, certainly one of Neil Young's best since the cd it's so often compared to, Harvest Moon. The closer, \\"When God Made Me\\", questioning whether there is only one way to worship god versus a more individual approach, is a real gem. The song before it, \\"He was the King\\" (referring to Elvis, that is), stands out as a bit of a clunker in the set both in it's lyrical content and it's forced \\"tossed off\\" approach. But overall the songs are very good and it's well recorded with good musicians. Any fan of Young's acoustic oriented material should enjoy this cd. <br /> <br />Those looking for a recent Young \\"masterpiece\\" though should perhaps look to his \\"Greendale\\" cd instead. Though not as accessible with it's minimally constructed songs (and some clocking in around the ten minute mark), the cd recorded with Crazy Horse demonstrates Young's gift to act as a lightening rod to inspiration. \\"Greendale\\" ranks with his absolute best and without question is his best work of the last twenty years.

B000C3H4M2|4.0|\\"Gestalt\\":  \\"A physical, biological, psychological, or symbolic configuration or pattern of elements so unified as a whole that its properties cannot be derived from a simple summation of its parts.\\" <br /> <br />Everybody who already knows that this is a great album already knows that this is a great album.        <br /> <br />I just want to fire off a warning to potential buyers, however:  the 5.1 mix restores startling clarity to individual instruments, but stymies the overall impact of the complete songs, which Brian Eno sculpted into their definitive form in 1979.   <br /> <br />Not only is there a hard to define difference in \\"Feel\\" to the tracks, but some Eno embellishments (I dare say MOST Eno embellishments) have been left entirely out of the 5.1 equation  (Some omissions are as shockingly obvious as the absence of bird song leading into \\"Drugs\\").   <br /> <br />Some parts of the arrangements that Eno fittingly pushed to the background, or \\"flattened\\" so as to render them textural, find their way back to the foreground.  As far as I can tell, they find their way back just \\"because\\":   just \\"because\\" we have the technology, just \\"because\\" such technological advances invariably make us hunger for purer and purer detail at the expense, in this case, of a unique and particular artistic vision. <br /> <br />In other words, I seriously doubt that \\"make sure that every nuance of every instrument is equally pronounced at every moment\\" was high on Eno's list of aesthetic concerns.  \\"Composition\\" entails arranging disparate parts into a harmonious whole. <br /> <br />So know this: if you'd dropped by Frantz's and Weymouth's loft on the two Sundays in 1979 on which the album was recorded, essentially live we are told, the 5.1 might well replicate that experience. <br /> <br />But this mix is simply not \\"Fear of Music\\".
0385720920|4.0|This is a fairly short book, readable in several hours. The author's writing style in undeniably authentic.<br /><br />Gritty and intrusive, you'll learn about things you weren't quite prepared for, and find that you keep turning pages wondering what will come next.<br /><br />The story carries some of the same kinds of oddities and oddballs I loved in 'Fight Club.' You wonder how he thinks up this stuff, and how much of it is based on real life.<br /><br />The book leaves you thinking about a side of society that is hidden from the mainstream, but most certainly exists.<br /><br />While not as good as 'Fight Club' and on par with 'Survivor,' it was a good read. I recommend it to those who like to peer into the hidden depths of our society. Things are happening right next to us, but cleverly disguised. The part about casual sex addicts on airplanes was an eye opener, especially if it is based on reality.<br /><br />Warning: This book contains some banal elements described in graphic detail. We're talking about sex addicts here. Very little is left to the imagination. The book is definitely not for children or young adults.
B000301YY8|1.0|This will seem like a really stupid review, but its honest...especially to people who wanna know whether the cd is actually good or not. So here i go: <br />I tried to give this cd a chance but it just didnt do it for me! The problem mostly lies in Blunts voice. It is shrill, whiny and irratating. I only had to listen to 'You're Beautiful' to begin to be frustrated with worldwide audiences at the unexplainable success of this singer! <br />Anyway, there is nothing reely worth buying this cd for - as mentioned Blunt's vocals are empty; his lyrics are melodramtic; and the compositions are simple, but i guess that adds to the effect of the cd and genre... <br />I tried to give his songs a chance, but there is just no room for him! The one star rating is plainly for the song 'Goodbye My Lover', which i hate so much i actually liked it. Bizarre, but yes. But i take comfort in the fact that in a week or so it will be out of my head forever! <br />This is a simple cd from one of the most overhyped singers since Norah Jones or Dido. <br />If you want a simliar cd go out and try Damien Rices 'O'. He is an artist who deserves proper recognition when people like Blunt are hogging the limelight! In possibly Blunts only good song 'Goodbye My Lover', he wails at the end of the track \\"Im so hollow baby... Im so hollow\\" How appropriate!
B00004HYLF|5.0|I was just listening to this album for the first time in a long while, and confirmed it as one of my all time favorite records; one broadened my musical life. For me, this was the ideal blend of Jazz and Rock music - plenty of energy and fire, along with subtely, innovation and dynamics. <br /> <br />I like the production on this album - it is big and bold, like the band, and suits the performances well. <br /> <br />Along with his first solo album, \\"Land of the Midnight Sun\\", Romatic Warrior showed the great promise of Al Dimeola; unfortunately, I don't think his later work ever came close to matching the exuberant playing on this record - on this album, he took chances, and (gasp) even made a mistake or two!  <br /> <br />Lenny White is a standout on this album - his dynamics, taste and powerful driving style gives this record its energy and joy. <br /> <br />Chick is a master, and I think his synth solo on \\"Duel of the Jester and the Tyrant\\" is one of the best ever recorded - I especially like the few bars at the end where he really takes it outside, and climbs back into a wonderful climax - I never tire of listening to it. His phrasing and touch on acoustic piano and Rhodes are superlative, and he plays a mean clavinet too. <br /> <br />I saw RTF on tour for this album when I was in my teens, and I can tell you that the live show was even more jaw-dropping than the records. The stage had two huge mirrors suspended over Lenny White and Chick Corea, so that you could watch their hands as they played. This was back in the 70's, so Chick sat in the middle of a huge array of keyboards - it was an impressive physical as well as musical performance. One of the things I remember was that Lenny White, after doing an amazing drum solo, held up a hand-lettered sign on a piece of cardboard that said \\"thank you!\\"  it was funny and charming, and I think  that it is the sense of humor and fun that really comes through on this album that has helped make it stand the test of time for me.  <br /> <br />If you haven't bought this record, I can't recommend it highly enough. In particular, if you love hard rock / metal but are curious about jazz, this is a good entry point (as it was for me - my favorite album prior to hearing this one for the first time was Nazareth's \\"Razzamanazz\\" - another favorite!)
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I have not seen the musical, which will probably make the hardcore Rentheads here outcast me. Nevertheless I fell in love with the show and immediately bought the soundtrack. To be quite honest I don't think I've turned it off since, and I bought it in November.  <br /> <br />I also want to respond to the review that said the PG-13 rating was inappropriate. The play is not intended for children, also I don't think any children who saw the trailer said \\"Mommy, Daddy, I want to see RENT!!!\\" Plus, kids don't pay attention to ratings anymore. If the kid wants to see it, their going to rent the R rated movie behind his or her parent's back. If the kid is going to see a truly fantastic film that addresses adult issues, he or she might as well see this.
0140177396|4.0|The book I read was Of Mice and Men. It was written by John Steinbeck. The main conflict of this book was for these two men George and Lennie to make their dream of farming their own farm and where they could raise rabbits come true. They would travel from farm to farm and do work on different farms to make their living. <br /> In this book there were many things I liked and a few things I didn't like. The book was very exciting to read. It was so exciting because I was always wondering what was going to happen next and I didn't want to put the book down. I really felt like I was actually in the book. I felt this way because Steinbeck described everything so well, and I could picture every scene that happened. The main conflict interested me a lot. It interested me because there were many obstacles that Lennie and George had to face throughout the book and I just wanted to see if they could make their dream come true. I thought that the characters felt very real. They seemed real because Steinbeck gave the right amount of descriptions about each of them. The ending was very satisfying. It was a bit sad and I think it could have been better but if it ended differently the book wouldn't have been as good. <br /> The author John Steinbeck's writing style is unusual. The author's voice is a narrative style and it's written in the way the characters actually spoke. The characters talk like poor, uneducated people. The author uses vocabulary in an interesting way. He uses poor grammar and slang words to speak like the characters. The author uses a lot of dialog in this book. The two main characters speak to each other a lot. I think that the author is a very good writer because I could actually hear the voice of the characters. He describes things but he doesn't go overboard to make it boring. <br /> Compared to other books that I have read I would rate this book an eight out of ten. I give it this rating because it was a very good book and held my attention but there were a few parts he could have changed, like the ending. I recommend this book to any guy or girl. It is a very fast and good read.  <br />  Overall this was one of the best books I have ever read. I would put this book in my top twenty favorite books. I've read another book by Steinbeck called The Pearl that I didn't really enjoy. I hope other books by Steinbeck are this god. Some other things that happened in this book was that Lennie wasn't very educated and George would always have to look out for him. Lennie loved to pet soft things. He would catch a mouse put it in his pocket and pet the mouse and squeeze it so hard that the mouse accidentally died. This would upset George a lot. <br />
1400031354|2.0|Yes, there is a nice description of Botswana (nice thoughtful softhearted people all, beautiful land; AIDS?  What AIDS?). Even that becomes a bit tedious at times.  After first seven-eight times even I did get the idea that a proper Botswana's way to shake hands and to accept gifts is with two hands.  It did not have to be repeated twenty three more times.  Yet it was the best part of the book.  Mystery solving?  Well, it goes like that: Mma Ramotswe goes to the place of the crime, and \\"knows\\" how it all happened.  Needless to say, she is correct.  There goes deductive logic, Watson.  And for a coup de grace the subplot: Mr.  J.L.B. Matekoni (I think probably about twenty pages of this short book were filled by endless repetition of \\"Mr.  J.L.B. Matekoni\\"; no short names in Botswana?  Can we call him Bob?)  adapts two poor little orphans, older sister and younger brother.  Of course the orphans live in orphanage, and have everything they need, because this is Botswana's way (after all, we are not like Nigeria......), but still no parents.  Touching.  Not touching enough.  Little girl is paraplegic.  Still not touching enough.  Turns out when little children's tribal mother died in the jungle, the newborn brother was buried with the dead mother, because it is the jungle's way, therefore it is correct, and who are we to judge. Apparently, the jungle way is also to bury the kid alive, rather than to finish him/her off first, and it must contain the wisdom of the millennia.  Indeed, it turned to be quite fortunate in this particular case:  the little girl (not a paraplegic yet), waits, digs out the brother, takes him to town, and cares for him for four years on the streets.  I wonder, why the great tribal elders buried the kid rather than to take him to town, but never mind, may be it was a long walk, and it was raining, and no FedEx drop off box nearby. Then little girl becomes paraplegic, and is picked up by the great orphanage where she and the brother lack nothing.Anybody crying yet?  Before accusing me of being so very insensitive, please realize that none of that actually happened.  It is fiction, and as such I find this to be quite a bit overdone.  And now, for a final politically correct vignette, Bob (Mr.  J.L.B. Matekoni) is a car mechanic, and (being childless) has a dream that the little former orphan brother will inherit his garage.  Noops, not touching enough.  It is the little paraplegic girl who is interested and has a talent to become a car mechanic, and who are we to object to that?  I bet that eventually she will succeed (but maybe after she becomes a quadriplegic and blind in some subsequent book to make it more touching?). I will never know.  I was also told that the series gets better.  I will never know myself, either........
B000003EUL|5.0|When Richter first arrived on the musical scene in the West, he went on a whirlwind tour of America, including numerous concerts at Carnegie Hall. This recording is part of that well-anticipated tour. Power, subtlety, angst are all present here. Richter really understood the heart of the pieces he played, and it shows from the very few opening bars of the first movement. There are some passages which are truly oustanding, but I dont have a score with me to point them out. It's just that you feel truly at ease when you listen to this CD that a master (Richter) is truly playing another master's (Brahms') composition.
B0000A14WB|4.0|I am a big Beach Boys fan and would give this album five stars but there is something about this album that no one seems to point out that makes me prefer a different BB album like \\"Today\\" over Pet Sounds. Every song seems to be overly drenched in studio reverb. Maybe it's the Phil Spector influence at work here but some of these songs sound to me like they are coming from the bottom of a well. And the modern stereo versions seem to exaggerate this quality also. Instead of a stereo mix I'd rather hear a \\"dry mix\\". Some of Carol Kaye's picked bass parts as lovely and melodic as they are sound like the bass amp was distantly miked from the back of a cement parkade. Just not my cup of tea and just my opinion.
015603008X|1.0|The book I read was called Flowers for Algernon. This book was written by Daniel Keyes. The main conflict of the book was about this developmentally delayed adult named Charlie who was trying to beat the lab mouse Algernon in a maze race. Algernon had a surgery done on his brain to make him smarter. The researchers wanted to try the same surgery on Charlie to see if he could beat the mouse after the surgery.<br /><br />There were a few things I liked about this book and many things I didn't like about this book. I thought this book was not exciting at all. I didn't enjoy the whole point of the book. I felt this way because I am not very interested in reading or research studies. I was not able to feel like I was in the book. I felt this way because I really can't connect in any way to the story. The main conflict didn't interest me in anyway. I just didn't like the whole concept of the book and to me it was boring. I do think the characters seemed very realistic. I felt the author gave a lot of descriptions about the characters. In some instances he gave so much information that it became boring. The books ending to me was extremely disappointing. I felt this way because I didn't really care for the whole book whole book and I was so bored of reading it that it didn't really matter to me.<br /><br /> Daniel Keyes writing style for Flowers for Algernon is unique. He writes in the voice of Charlie the main character. Much of the book is written by Charlie through his own notes that he is keeping. At times there are so many misspelled words that it is almost difficult to read. The author doesn't really use vocabulary in an interesting way. His writing style seems basic. The author does use Charlie's self written notes as dialog to tell the story and let the reader know Charlie's emotions. Daniel Keyes writing is descriptive yet slightly dull. The tone throughout the book is almost monotone and it lacks excitement. I know that Flowers for Algernon is a classic novel but I found the authors writing style to be somewhat boring. I would have liked a little more excitement in the book but maybe the author wanted to show how sad, pathetic, and dull Charlie's life was.<br /><br /> I would rate this book two stars out of ten compared to other books that I have read. I give it this rating because it was so boring and dull that I just wanted to stop reading it. I guess I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone unless they want to read about a sad research study.<br /><br /> I think this book was HORRIBLE. Another thing that happened in the book was that in the beginning of the book he had to keep taking little tests to see if he would be able to have the surgery and do the experiment. He obviously got to do the experiment.the authors writing style to be somewhat boring.

B00005U8EM|5.0|It's ironic that Bill Murray's character lives the same day over and over, because I can watch this film over and over too. <br /> <br />It's funny, touching, thought-provoking, great writing and an excellent cast. <br /> <br />\\"Bing!\\"
B000002KIE|1.0|I don't see what the big fuss is about the Sex Pistols. If you ask me, they just straightforward sucked, and even Johnny Rotten admits he can't sing. It's just complete crap, and had the Sex Pistols exsisted today, with underground music at all, they would have never been so revolutionary. Get Dead Kennedy's and Descendents for good punk.
B000002MM8|5.0|I heard about Dead Can Dance from an online forum. Aparently Travis Meeks from Days of the New is a huge fan. I really enjoyed this music. Do not buy it and only listen once, you will not do yourself or the music a bit of justice. It IS different, but it is also very refreshing. The best comparison, which is a poor one at best, is Enigma. Lisa Gerrard has some amazing vocals, and the male singer, whom I cannot recall, sounds a lot like Frank Sinatra. Lisa has appeared musically on a lot of music, including the movies Blackhawk Down, Tears of the Sun and Gladiator to name a few. This is fantastic background music if want to have a nice relaxing evening, open a bottle of wine and just have deep conversations with your loved one. Beautiful music.
044022425X|1.0|Last night, the inner romantic in me was frog-marched outside with a burlap sack over his head, kicked into a kneeling position above a ditch full of running sewage, then shot in the back of the head before being pushed into the flotsam. The trigger was pulled by none other than Diana Gabaldon.<br /><br />This is a novel for die-hard fans of this series, or for those who have very strong masochistic streaks (and stronger stomachs), as there is nothing remotely interesting or exciting that occurs. We're introduced to two new characters to either love or wish a hellish demise on (depending on your point of view). This is just another fat, flabby, nearly thousand-page exercise on Gabaldon's part in her neverending series about the least likable couple since Adolf and Eva. This is bad enough on its own, but we're now subjected to Claire's daugher as a major character (who I maintain is an adult version of Rosemary's Baby), paired with yet another blithering idiot of a male for a husband to make this novel Hell's delight.<br /><br />The bulk of this exercise takes place in the Carolinas in the 18th Century, occasionally shifting to late 1960s Scotland and Massachusetts, so if you find clearing land and building shacks to be the most fascinating activity at the highest pitch of excitement yet devised by mankind, then you'll absolutely love this novel. There are other tangents that are offered as a way of fleshing out the story, (A bear attack that didn't provoke excitement, but elicited a huge eye-roll on my part as it fell flatter than my grandfather's cardiogram. Jamie and Claire spending a night outside in the middle of winter under a lean-to made of Hemlock branches that annoyed me so much that I wish they'd been stupid enough to make tea out of the Hemlock. Also there's Gabaldon's never-ending humbug about the time-travel circles being drawn out with yet more jargon to pad out a story that should have been told in 50 pages. I swear she gets paid by the word), but they're as interesting as trying to see if there really are 2000 flushes in a 2000 Flush toilet tablet.<br /><br />With the adventure having flat-lined in this story, Gabaldon's writing about the undying devotion and slop between Jamie and Claire elicited yawns on my part as well. Apart from one egregiously bad bout of Jamie and Claire coupling like stoats in the wilds (I defy anybody to defend a line like this: \\"Christ, your mouth is as slick and salty as your qu*m\\" and say that the passage that it's from is worthy of anything other than having dog's abuse hurled at it), Gabaldon manages to keep her passages regarding Jamie and Claire's dancing the mattress two-step to within the acceptable limits of bad taste (apart from Gabaldon's never-ending nipple fixation) that made them merely boring instead of maddening. But........<br /><br />Gabaldon came out of nowhere and landed a right hook on me with Roger and Brianna's first time they thundered the night away like King Hal on honeymoon for its hopelessly risible qualities. Whether it's Brianna's mumphing \\"Mi oing i' i'?\\" (translation: \\"Am I doing it right?\\") as she takes aboard a consignment of British sausage for the first time, or a description which goes \\"Another minute, and he was going off like a waterspout\\", I couldn't help but be amused. Laugh? Why, I laughed so hard that I cried.<br /><br />Even though Gabaldon wrote that above passage which I think is the biggest farce since Chuckles the clown retired, it's still not enough to redeem an abysmally bland and hopelessly adrift book. Calling this the worst book of the series is a rather perplexing problem for me, as trying to pick which of Gabaldon's books is the worst is like trying to decide which manure pile smells the worst. Approach this book only if you're armed with a crucifix, garlic, holy water, and a wooden stake. Even then, you'll still suffer.they're as interesting as trying to see if there really are 2000 flushes in a 2000 Flush toilet tablet. <br />  <br />With the adventure having flat-lined in this story, Gabaldon's writing about the undying devotion and slop between Jamie and Claire elicited yawns on my part as well.

B0009HLDFU|3.0|So, the new foo fighters record is a double and as we are in an age of downloads, ipods, mp3 and music as ringtones culture its perhaps a bold move. The premise is simple, one half rock one half acoustic and  predictably it's the rock half that on first listen at least jumps out, there's some great stuff on here Dave Grohl at this stage in his career knows his way around a tune and tracks such as 'Resolve' 'Best of you' and 'DOA' are testament to his knack of writing finely crafted pop melodies although on occasion some songs feel a bit generic and border dangerously close to filler territory thus continuing the trend from 2002's one by one release but really this is a minor quibble the songs rock, and the production in particular is excellent so everything you'd expect from a Foo Fighters album then, fans of the band will not be disappointed. Which brings me to disc two which feels like a Dave Grohl solo record, entirely acoustic with some songs dating back as far as his Nirvana days the plaintive 'Friend of a Friend' which documents Grohls early initiation in the band when he shared an apartment with Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain those looking for  some salacious insight into the now well documented troubled mind of Cobain will have to look elsewhere. There are some guest appearances on this disc Josh Homme of QOTSA lends his guitar work on for me the highlight of this disc the closing track 'Razor' elsewhere we find erstwhile Led Zeppelin legend John Paul Jones on piano and mandolin duties 'Miracle' and 'Another Round' respectively, its not all predictable though, Jazz artist Norah Jones adds some breathy vocal and piano stylings to the lovely 'Virginia MOON.' and produces another highlight unfortunately too many of the songs feel like demos and would have benefited from the use of different instrumentation to flesh them out a little. Dave grohl was recently quoted as saying he would like this album to stand up to other double albums notably Led Zeppelins masterwork 'Physical Graffiti' and be talked about in the same breath as, and while that is doubtful, this album despite its flaws  signifies a change of direction for the Foo Fighters who knows what their next record might take them.
B000001FTD|5.0|Anthrax were a lot more melodic and acessible than the other thrash bands in the 80's. Just great, starightforward, fast hard rock songs comign out of these guys. This album just helps prove that, and is definitly the best album Anthrax ever released (curse you John Bush). Tracks 2 through 6 are all amazing. The others are good too. This album is an essential for any hard rock fan.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Yes I'm a fan, or browncoat as they're called. I can't help it. This really was a brilliant series. Quite possibly the best television series of 2002. When you watch this show enough times, you begin to realize how icredibly well written and directed the show is. Little things pop up that you never noticed before. If you're a film buff, you'll love this tv show. Joss Whedon treats each episode as if it were a small film. Episodes like \\"Objects in space\\" and \\"Out of gas\\" exemplify what a huge error Fox made in canceling this show. But what can I say? It figures. I could go on and on, but I won't.  <br /> <br />Buy this box set! I guarantee you will not regret it. In fact you'll thank me.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Great movie. Probably the best movie this year. Great story and not because of the \\"gay cowboy\\" storyline. Actually once you start watching the movie, the \\"gay\\" part doesn't even come into mind, if you give the movie a true chance. The scenery is amazing and the acting is truly award winning. Definietly recommend this movie to others.
B000092T6M|4.0|I just wanted to begin by making clear that it is the Special Edition that I'm about to describe, as some of the reviews above seem a little incongruous.  But onwards... <br /> <br />The second disk contains the sort of extras you would expect for something labelled Special Edition:  Documentary, Cast Interviews, Production notes, an expo on medieval weopons.  Of particular note would be the inclusion of the video of Everything I do (I do it for You), which will be popular with fans of the Bryan Adams song. <br /> <br />Perhaps of greater significance is the inclusion of 12 extra minutes in the main feature film.  Most of these have extended scenes that were already present (so a good knowledge of the original movie may be required to spot some of the more subtle differences), but there are one or two whole new scenes that take in a sub-plot involving the Sheriff of Nottingham.  Fans of Alan Rickman's performance will be delighted to with this inclusion, as it gives an even greater showcase of his comic abilities.  Splicing the extra scenes into the film rather than giving them their own separate section on the extra DVD is also a nice touch and enhances the continuity of the film. <br /> <br />Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves therefore remains a rip-roaring adventure, but with this Special Edition the film certainly is enhanced, and despite relatively ordinary extras, is worthwhile for the extended sections of the film alone.

B000C65Z1G|1.0|<br />. . . And this Constant Gardner movie is no exception. Except they did capture the boring, drumming meter of the book. The book, which I snoozed through, garnered justifiably lame reviews; I expect the movie, eventually, after the hype, will too. I'm irked at myself that I didn't wait for the initial PR barrage to subside.
B00005JNRE|5.0|my 6 and 9 year olds loved it! it stars emma thompson who also wrote the screenplay based on a children's book. therefore expect it to be sufficiently eccentric/quirky with her great british humor. the kids also are great as is colin firth. <br /> <br />good family humor with a nice \\"moral\\" woven in. <br />
B000002OVJ|5.0|This album sounds great, despite the fact that some of the tracks have been tampered with during the remastering. I own both the original vinyl and the CD and I honestly think the CD is better. There's more songs and the live impact of the Who's maximum R&B style is completely intact. Even if the sound has been improved and is no longer \\"live\\", many bands have done this. The Clash's excellent live album has had all of its tracks cleaned up and overdubbed, and it STILL sounds great. By the way, for those of you who think Led Zep's still the dog's bollocks, I've got news for you... they're NOT!!! Buy Live at Leeds!
0330295128|5.0|This book is out of print but shouldn't be.  Every golfer knows that the mental game is more than half of the battle.  After you've lowered your handicap to 20 or so, most golfers become victims of what I call \\"tip-itis\\".  Your pro or friend says Shoulder up, left arm straight, rotate hips,etc and suddenly you're standing on the tee wondering which of those is responsible for the drive which went big left.  Gallwey explains that it's the lack of concentration...in terms that are sometimes a little too new age but that actually work to help you just swing and not get in the way of your own ability. Read it - it helps!  No excuse for good fundamentals, but the mental side is equally or more important.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Shallow, unmoving drivel from the single most overrated singer of modern times.  If you love Empty Vee and all the tripe it represents you'll probably be satisfied with this junk like all the other cultural lemmings it panders to.  If, however, you seek genuine meaning, art, and emotion in the music you listen to, it is time to move one.  Think outside the box, people.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I went with a crowd to see this movie, in part because the other theatres were sold out. I had heard several negative comments, mostly by my British friends, and wasn't keen on seeing it.  <br /> <br />Overall, it was an enjoyable movie, but not a classic, and certainly nothing on the scale of the 1995 BBC series which I was forced to watch once or twice (it is very long). <br /> <br />People are correct when they say that the 2005 version failed to capture the essence of Jane Austen's society. The British, living closer to history than the Americans do, were justifiable in their lukewarm reaction. Too much 21st century sensibilities were injected into 1810 or whatever the year of the story, and if you are a history buff, as I am, it can be annoying to see modern thoughts and behavior presented with regency costumes. The behavior of the Bennet family and the society at the ball in the movie would have mortified the original characters in Jane Austen's day. The ball scene, with people behaving more like country bumpkins and farmers rather than the class conscious, manners obsessive, landed gentry they actually were, was unrealistic. And even an impoverished family of any pretensions (as the Bennets were portrayed to us in this version) would not have had pigs running around just outside the back door, let alone walking through the front hall of the house. It was also a bit unfair to portray Mrs. Bennet as a boorish drunkard.  <br /> <br />As it stands, a major reason many people love Austen's work is the portrayal of a society and its mores that have long since disappeared, a society where everything one said or did was carefully examined, analyzed, and criticized by its members, and the obsession with \\"gentle\\" values and \\"gentle\\" behavior was paramount. The 1995 BBC version very much caught the essence of that society along with the portrayal of the love story, which is why it has become a classic. Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility also does an excellent job incapturing the feel of the period. <br /> <br />Still, ignoring the flaws and the director's failure to capture the essence of 18th/19th century society, the movie was a fun watch. Not remarkable, and certainly not a classic, but enjoyable. The 1995 BBC version, for very good reasons, will be the one to last the ages and be watched by people fifty years down the road, long after Keira Knightly has been forgotten.
B00008OWZC|5.0|What a masterpiece these live performances are. There is a special something about these songs that make every minute priceless. I think that it might be the time period as all four musicians were on top of their game. Led Zeppelin is the greatest rock back ever. This live album is a treasure!
B00025ETIW|3.0|three cheers for sweet revenge is one of those albums that you wont hang on to, it gets boring fast. All the songs sound simuler and the lirics are used time and time again. The first time you listen to it it sounds O.K, but then it starts getting worse and worse. By the time you listen to it the fouth or fith time it is old! I haven't heard their ather albums so I wouldn't know if they are getting worse or a bit bitter each time. One or two of their songs are enjoying a couple of times but if I were you i would down load the songs instead of buying the entire album.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|Just cuz a movie is wierd and twisted doesnt mean it is necessarily good. I love twisted movies - that have a point. Whats the point of  this movie? All my family and friends who say they love this movie cant even explain it to me. Its so good cuz of the cast. Oooo its so good cuz that bunny is so crazy. The colors are so cool. The soundtrack is really good. Thats all fine but none of that matters if the movie doesnt make sense. Is there some big statement about the state of the world? An observation about the power of love? Something about white american surburbia? Time travel? Schizophrenia? I dont get it. The whole movie is a just a countdown and then jake goes back and doesnt talk to the bunny so he dies. big deal. Events are altared. Wow. There s never been a movie about time travel where events in time are changed. Someone please explain this mess to me.
B000065LZE|3.0|Led Zeppelin IV reminds me of a balance scale. On one side of the balance it's got Black Dog. It's got Rock and Roll. It's obviously got Stairway to Heaven. And it's got When the Levee Breaks. Of course, this represents all the excellent material that can be found here. And on Early Days...more with that later. On the other hand, it's got Battle of Evermore. It's got Misty Mountain Hop. It's got Four Sticks (the second-worst Song Led Zeppelin Ever recorded, for the record). And it's got Goin' to California. In other words, it's an uneven mess--literally every good song has its bad counterpart. Call me insane, say I'm comitting Rock 'n Roll Suicide, flame me, give me all the \\"not-helpful\\" votes you want, dub me a blasphemer...but I'd skip it and by Early Days, which contains the album's best material in my mind. Then buy I, II and Physical Graffitti, and you'll have maximum Zeppelin.<br /><br />And to all of the \\"Zeppelin-is-god\\" people...PLEASE! In spite of all their talents, Led Zeppelin is simply a rock band, nothing more and nothing less. And anybody who believes that Led Zeppelin IV is mankind's greatest achievement has never heard of some slightly more practical things, such as agriculture, the domestication of animals, written/spoken language and electricity.
B0006399FS|5.0|Dropping a \\"one-star\\" just cause your pissed about the Grammy's (cause your artist didn't win) or because you aren't a real U2 Fan is not a \\"review\\".      Get over it; the Steelers won the super bowl (I'm a Seahawks fan).     That said:    I couldn't agree with the whiners less!  But you know how it is.  One man's treasure is another man's poop log.    Very solid and moving CD.  Seriously, I just went back to the CD a few a weeks ago.  Sometimes that's the true test.  I really think the album is solid all the way through.  Every song stands on it's own.  I think what turned some non diehard U2 fans off on this CD is that the first song comes out of the gate (BAM!) and the rest of the CD is a mixture of down-tempo ballads and some medium rocking songs.  Of course, I'm a avid U2 fan.  I'm the type that skips the first song (Vertigo - it is a great song though) and goes straight to the emotional (emo) stuff........    Sometimes you can't make it on your own, Miracle drug,  City of blinding lights,  Yahweh, Crumbs,.......    Anyway, that's my take.  I'm Anderson Cooper (not really) CNN....

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|When I heard that a new version of Pride & Prejudice was being filmed, I doubted that it could ever meet the standard set by the 1995 BBC miniseries starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, a fantastic adaptation of a book I've re-read too many times to count. It ended up being my favorite movie of 2005. <br /> <br />Pride & Prejudice is a story that requires great performances in order to be fully effective. I originally didn't understand the choice of Keira Knightley for the role of Elizabeth Bennett, but she proved me wrong and did an absolutely wonderful job. Her Oscar nomination is well deserved. (But if she is \\"plain\\" looking, we're all screwed.) I LOVED Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy. Rather than imitating Colin Firth's well adored performance, he gave a new interpretation of the role that fit in perfectly. As Roger Ebert said in his review, it's \\"well cast from top to bottom.\\" <br /> <br />I'm normally a complete book snob. But despite the fact that it's not a entirely faithful adaptation (if it were, we'd have been sitting in the theater the entire day), I think it ultimately captures the essence of Jane Austen's novel. I don't know why some are getting so worked up over minute historical details that do not effect the quality of the film whatsoever. I liked the more \\"modern\\" additions made to the movie and the more rugged feel it has. Who wants to see a rehash of something that has already been done with the novel? <br /> <br />I know the story like the back of my hand, but the way it was presented made me feel the same delight as when I read the book for the first time. I walked out of it on cloud nine. Watch it with an open mind, and you will too. Can't wait to own it on DVD.
B000002L42|4.0|I think that they should have had Denny Dias and Jeff Baxter play at some of the shows to capture the early flavor of their sound versus revamping as many bands do due to playing it for years (there are tapes from radio concerts in the early 70s out there), some of the original session musicians from the later albums, and presented it on 2 CDs because a lot is missing from it.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|People who bash Octavarium (the album) because it isnt ToT don't know DT well enough and need to just put their System of a Down CD back in their player (not to say ToT was a bad album by any means.) People who bash Octavarium (the song) either did not look hard enough, have the uncanny ability to ignore a masterpiece, or they probably just arent a fan of this band. Octavarium (the album) is not the best DT release by any means, but neither is it a poorly executed, rehashed album as some reviewers have dubbed it. Octavarium (the song) is in my opinion (the only one that matters,) the best song that this band has ever created.
B000006TRV|4.0|As a multimedia experience, it is a classic. If you put the album, film, and concert together, it comes out to an amazing project that few bands have achieved at the same level before or since.  <br /> <br />There is a lot of great music here. Comfortably Numb brought down the house at Live 8. Run Like Hell, Hey You and Another Brick in the Wall II are radio classics. However, this also caused the friction within the band and was undoubtably the beginning of the end of PF with Roger Waters.  <br /> <br />My opinion is that Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and Animals was Pink Floyd. The Wall, Final Cut and Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking were Roger's solo projects, but David Gilmour's guitar playing and singing on \\"Young Lust\\" and in other parts makes The Wall anything but a solo project.  <br /> <br />The Wall represents a lot of things here: the wall that comes up in bad relationships, the Wall between reality and delusion, and having it become seemingly insurmountable. Roger's seeds of his own father dying in wartime, British education (funny that someone who would write \\"we don't need no education\\" was a university student and would have to answer to his own kids about that line, overbearing parents, his marriage, and watching Syd Barrett disintegrate before him as well as the wall he had between himself and the fans when they hit the big time created this project, putting them all into a character named \\"Pink\\" (\\"Have a Cigar\\", \\"Welcome to the Machine\\", and \\"Us and Them\\" in a way were the preface to \\"The Wall). To me, this is a very British album as much as anything the Kinks did a decade earlier, but has universal appeal.  <br /> <br />Towards the end, Pink has to face the fears that the wall built up, but unfortunately the wall built up between the band.   <br /> <br />
B00004T9UF|5.0|Everything here is perfect. His first CD was all in good fun, but he gets down to business and combines his sick humor with a mature side for a masterpiece. Subject matter, originality, smooth flow and lyrics; this album has everything. <br /> <br />WHY DONT YOU OWN IT YET?
B000002ITW|5.0|Sure this album sounds dated. Sure we can look back on it and laugh at how funny some Stephen Still's improvisations are at the end of 49 Bye-Byes/America's Children are. Sure Suite: Judy Blue Eyes is 33 seconds long. Sure this is an amazing live album. I wasn't around back in '71 and never got a chance to see these guys live, so this is as close as it gets for me. This has to be one of my all time favorite live albums. It is one of those albums that you can put on for background music and find yourself doing nothing but sitting and listening. Every time I listen, I can hear something new in either the songs or the chatter between tracks. Chicago and 49 Bye-Byes/America's Children are full of emotion and rank as two of my favorite tracks on the album. And I don't even have the CD; just the open reel tape.
B000C1YL1G|5.0|A lot of my Slim Shady favorites are missing here, but it's still a good buy for those new to Eminem who dont wanna hunt for all these albums. Nas said it best, \\"Eminem murdered you own your own sh**\\" (about Renegade, which was on Jay-Z's album), which just goes to show how great of a rapper Eminem is. <br /> <br />His first 3 albums were all perfect, but if you dont wanna buy all of those definitely get this release.

B00005JOFO|3.0|In the summer of 1963, Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) are hired to me sheepherders on Brokeback Mountain.  This is the first time they have met, and gradually a friendship forms between the two.  One cold night, the friendship turns into something more.  They agree to keep things a secret, and really do not expect to see each other again.<br /><br />Ennis marries Alma (Williams), and Jack marries Lureen (Hathaway).  Despite trying to lead normal lives, they cannot forget their time together.  Eventually Jack makes contact with Ennis, and their relationship is rekindled.<br /><br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is not a movie for everyone, and I was indifferent to it.  The cast all do a good job, especially Ledger and Williams, who deserve the Oscar nominations they received.  The story, however, was unremarkable to me.  The only thing that makes it \\"special\\" is that the two leads are gay, or at least bi-sexual.  And that will be the downfall of the movie for many.  Finally, the movie feels longer than it is.  135 minutes is a lot to ask for this story, and that hurts the film too.  I cannot recommend this movie, but I do think that it will find a appreciative audience with some.
B000BW7QWW|1.0|I'll be brief.  Bad audio, couldn't make out what they were saying which says volumes about the poor production quality. <br /> <br />No name actors can sometimes rise above, but not this time.  <br />Ho hum story and the revelation near the end about what River knows and why she is being chased is a bit of a let down.  <br /> <br />You would have to pay me to see this movie again.  Can't believe what passes for a \\"great\\" movies these days. <br /> <br />
B0009I7NNA|5.0|It's rare when you find and album where you love every song on it. With City of Evil by A7X (Avenged Sevenfold) I can say that and mean it. A7X are clearly influenced by bands like Metallica, Pantera, Iron Maiden, and GnR but they also have a unique style of their own. Most hard rock bands today don't include the blazing guitars like A7X which I think is one of their stand out qualities. If you like hard rock/metal you should definitely buy this album.
B000B5XZLU|5.0|Jamiroquai is a psychodelic 80's funk master. This album is full of funk, crunchy bass lines, horns galore and guitars spinning out of control. What holds it all together is the drums and percussion. If you like funk music, Marvin, influenced than you will like this album. The songs are all very upbeat and you find yourself singing along when you become aquainted with the album. Its really just a guilty pleasure. The more I listen to it the more I enjoy it. I have never had any Jamiroquai before this album. A good party album for sure!
B0006399FS|1.0|Can someone explain how a once great band (see their CD's Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby) has the ability to win music awards based solely on their likability by the music industry, rather than the actual music produced?  This CD is so painfully awful, I dare anyone, and I mean anyone to listen to it more than one time.             To find overlooked Grammy deserving artists CD's from last year, pick up either Black Lab - See The Sun or Collective Soul - Youth.   Their music speaks for itself.
6305428352|5.0|Mr. Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) starts in his teaching job so he'll have more time to do his own composing.  He's going to write an opus that'll make him famous and rich.  Turns out, his students need him.  There's the clarinet player who just can't find the sound.  There's the young gifted wrestler who needs a Band credit so he won't get failed and knocked off the team.  There's the singer who needs someone to watch over her.  Before you know it, it's 30 years---and Mr. Holland discovers just what that time in school has earned him. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful, heartwarming tale which is also a mini-musical history lesson in itself.  The soundtrack takes you from the classical to the Kingsmen's \\"Louie, Louie\\", lingers lovingly over John Lennon and the impact his life and death had on so many of the Baby Boomer generation, then finally ends with a very joyful noise even as budget cuts take down the music program in Oregon schools that men like Mr. Holland worked so hard to build.   <br /> <br />This is definitely a movie for the collection of any music lover, any lover of history and in general lover of a good acting and scripting.   <br /> <br />I just wish there could be an encore.
B00004VVNB|3.0|when i was little(9 or 10) this movie came out and i got my parents to take me to see it. i loved it and bought the book and read it,boy what a change of pace the book was. that said the f/x in the movie look very dated now and the story is very slim and you can drive a truck through the plot holes, but there is some fun to be had watching this one if you let it be fun. just don't expect it to be as good as you remember it was.
B00000J7A2|5.0|It was 1969, and I was a mere 13 years old when my Stoner older brother age 23 laid this one on me.  One listen to this Orgy for the ears, and every other rock and roll album of the day just seemed to pail in comparison.  I was that Jaded! After about 30th time around the ZENITH Record Player, I began to wonder, what makes this so addicting?  That's easy, there's really nothing like it!  So, again and again it plays...  It's that addicting.  Ok, pass the hash pipe!  Hell, you don't even need drugs, beefheart's music is a very satisfying trip in itself.  It's like the whole high desert opened up and belched a genuine boanfide masterpiece.  From Yellow Brick Road to Electricity, this is pure gold.  This is essentially Don's first Album.  There's something so whimsically wonderful about every track.  That's rare.  Every song is like an abstract painting.  Each cut is as riveting as the next.  I know, many of these masterful tunes have a standard beat!  Of course the Captain's later efforts are just as interesting and even more original.  But, this is the record to get first.  It opens the door and guides the listener into what follows.  Don Van Vliet is a true original, an American Blues Genius.  If the Devil Played this album in Hell, Baby it really would make you want to go!
B0002I831S|5.0|i'm one of the suckers who bought t.o.s. on the 2 stories per disc and now they finaly learned from other shows that the full season packs are much better and loved by the collectors like me. all the extras you could  want and great transfers. season one was the best i think because it only had a few clinkers in it. most of the shows were great. the one all trek fans have been looking for.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|There are very few bands and guitarists in the history of music who changed the face of rock and reinvented the guitar, making everyone who thought they knew the instrument re-evaluate their knowlegde. Well, exactly 28 years ago, on 10 February 1978 came out the greatest rock debut of all times. And to this day, no other guitar album has had more impact on music the same way. Sure there was Hendrix, Clapton, Page, Beck, and many other amazing players before Eddie Van Halen, but even these shredders acknowledged Eddie's impact and unmatchable playing and songwriting. Not since Jimi Hendrix' Are You Experienced? in 1967 were people, both guitarists and fans, so shocked at what they were hearing when \\"Eruption\\" hit the waves, displaying yet an unmatched energy, power and technique. Simply put, if there's one album that put guitar-oriented music back in its deserved place in the late 70's and made it stay there for decades on end, it's the self-titled Van Halen debut.<br /><br />\\"Eruption\\" is one of the most important musical statements ever made in the history of rock. Now known as the \\"brown sound\\", Eddie Van Halen's monster tone, his acrobatic hammer-ons, pull-offs, whammy-bar dives, and unique trademark two-handed tapping licks on this short instrumental suggest a true virtuoso in every sense of the word. Basically, with this song, Eddie changed everything in the blink of an eye. Even the most prolific guitar players refused to believe the nasty end part of the track was actually played on a guitar, cause it sounded too much like a frenetic keyboard solo. However, what truly makes \\"Eruption\\" so timeless is the compositional mindset it entails. Eddie actually wrote this piece way before 1978. There are 1975 bootlegs of Van Halen where Eddie plays a longer version of this piece. The one that ended up on the album is a more refined yet technically challenging version. The most interesting thing about the song, however, is that Eddie recorded it in just two takes. That's not too big a surprise for Van Halen fans though, considering the fact that this band was one of the fastest recording acts in the world and hated going over the same tune more than a handful times.<br /><br />The album produced two major hits when it was released. The opening song \\"Runnin' with the Devil\\" starts out with eight simple bass notes played by Michael Anthony and quickly launches into a hard-rocking anthem that brims with then unheard riffs and burning leads. On \\"Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love\\", Eddie's opening chords are epic in scope and powerful in impact. Graced with a great chorus and an impeccable back-up harmony, this song probably features Eddie's godliest solo on the album, aside from the untouchable \\"Eruption\\" that is. Van Halen's cover of The Kinks, \\"You Really Got Me\\", was actually the first single of the album and yielded a lot of fan interest in the band, despite its 2:37 minute running time. The band totally made this tune their own, while staying true to its integrity, they fueled it with their immense musicality and Eddie's soaring lead work. Another cover song on the album was the bluesy John Brim cut \\"Little Dreamer\\", instantly catchy with its chorus. The song is special for its acoustic intro though, being the first acoustic stuff Eddie put on tape.<br /><br />The other songs on the album are Van Halen's poppier hard rock numbers that got the crowds going in concerts, with the groovy bass and sweeping guitar on \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\", the ballady \\"Little Dreamer\\", and the smoking double solo-inserted \\"I'm the One\\". Eddie does some interesting scratching sounds on \\"Atomic Punk\\", which has some excellent backing vocals from Mike Anthony and Alex Van Halen. Eddie is \\"On Fire\\" on the last song, and his soloing is supposed to show his respect to John McLaughlin, except that I can't put the two guitarists in the same context.<br /><br />Much like their other Ted Templeman produced classic albums, this disc took a very little time to record. As with their next set of following releases, the music was recorded almost completely live with minimal overdubs. Eddie and the band would only play a song two or three times and pick their favourites. The music was recorded in only six days, while Roth took about two weeks to finish his vocals. The original sound quality wasn't really bad, but Warner Bros decided to remaster it anyway. To this day I still consider sound engineer Donn Landee one of the best in rock. Without Templeman and Landee, Van Halen albums would lack their sonic punch in my opinion. The duo did an amazing job capturing Van Halen's live feel on the first six albums.<br /><br />It would be hard to imagine a true rocker or metalhead not owning this record. VH1 is not my favourite, but it signalled the beginning of a new era and paved the way for thousands of other bands and guitarists who would rip their songs, image, stage presence, and Ed's chops of course.eleases, the music was recorded almost completely live with minimal overdubs.

B0007PAMR4|3.0|This DVD doesn't have much that's new in terms of the film itself; one side has the theatrical release, the other the \\"Alan Smithee\\" version.  In my opinion the Alan Smithee version is simply nasty - there are strange cuts and additions in the middle of characters speaking, the Prologue is long, poorly written, and the narrator is just wrong - he proves during the course of the film that he can't even say \\"Piter de Vries\\" correctly. There are stupidities such as trying to show the arrival of characters by presenting stock footage of a Harkonnen ship flying, even if the character arriving isn't a Harkonnen.   <br /> <br />The original David Lynch cut which Frank Herbert approved of, remains a mystery.   <br /> <br />Finally, there does not appear to have been any enhancement to the film quality; it doesn't seem to have been remastered. <br /> <br />That said, there are some small extras like Deleted Scenes and Designing Dune which are interesting.  If you are a heavy Dune fan, these extras make the DVD worth owning.

1591396190|1.0|The idea of finding so called \\"free open spaces\\" out of a non attractive industry was introduced by Harvard Professor Michael Porter in his book Competitive Advantage in 1985.   Chapter 7, Industry segmentation and competitive advantage, describes a powerful tool able to identify unexplored segments where the company can find a very favorable competitive structure. By combining on a two matrix variables the company's products features, the buyer's characteristics and the ways of distribution that can influence the company's competitive advantage and/or the industry structure and if you are good enough to elaborate on the content of these group of variables, as M. Porter suggests, it is possible to obtain a lot of feasible new markets combinations not already touched by competitors.  In Blue Ocean Strategy, the Authors suggest that new open spaces can be define by applying the following activities:  look at alternative industries, look across strategic groups, look across the chain of buyers, look across complementary products and service offering, look across functional or emotional appeal to buyers and look across time. Now, all the new open spaces that are possible to be determined by the use of the above activities, can be easily determined by applying the industry segmentation tool provided by M. Porter.    Also, where is strategy in this book?  The book provides, or it would be better to say: it reformulates, a way of finding some opportunities (blue ocean markets), and then what? What should the company do in the new blue ocean? Don't you think some other companies would jump in immediately with a more powerful strategy to succeed? The Authors argue that the company should focus, diverge and have a compelling tag line; they say that in half a page. Is it all the strategy the company should do?  At least Michael Porter's industry segmentation tool is very well supported and related with 400 pages on how to do strategy and how to make it sustainable.    With great disappointing I found nothing new in this book, everything has been said already and in a more professional way. It is a book for strategy amateurs; in my opinion it could be helpful in the external analysis stage of the strategic planning process, where the company should explore for new opportunities.    What is the reason for its success?  In my opinion is the timing. The book has come out in a time where almost every industry is unattractive, overcrowded by competitors. Companies and consultants are desperate to find new solutions, opportunities. This book has come out on a perfect timing. On the other hand, M. Porter with his Industry Segmentation came out in the 80's when the pressure on the competitive forces was not as hard as it is today.    For those entrepreneurs interested in finding new open spaces not explored by competitors yet, I would suggest to read Competitive Advantage, Chapter 7. It has been extremely helpful to my company.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain, Brokeback Mountain, what IS it about Brokeback Mountain? After all, it's JUST a movie, right? Well...not exactly... <br /> <br />There's something about this film that simply, well, gets under your skin. And it stays there until you DO something about it, until you process what your trip to Brokeback Mountain has been for you. I suspect there's a little bit of Brokeback Mountain in all of us. Sure, we all live different lives, but there is a haunting universality to this film that somehow reaches a very deep and oh-so-personal place in the viewer's soul. For this alone I feel Brokeback Mountain deserves all the kudos, (and more), that are coming its way. <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain is a story of joy, of hope, of disappointment, of regret, and much, much more. It's all there. It's a truly human film, and it spans the twenty-some year relationship of two friends, possibly soul mates. This story juxtaposes the power of society's structure and conditioning with the undeniable power of awareness of one's personal truth. It's about survival and destruction. And yes, Brokeback Mountain is a story of love, a love that could be neither denied nor fulfilled. <br /> <br />Before I saw Brokeback Mountain I suspected it was going to hardwire itself onto my mental plate. <br /> <br />And guess what, it did. <br /> <br />This movie is delicate and subtle as it is thundering and raw. It has beautiful scenery, (many panoramic shots are of the Kananaskis Valley in Alberta, Canada), and very real, believable people who interact, at times, with soul-wrenching passion. And if you like interpreting body language, you'll be finding yourself at a virtual smorgasbord! <br /> <br />For me, Brokeback Mountain is the true story of many upon many, (regardless of gender), portrayed by its fictitious characters. <br /> <br />And about Ang Lee, the film's masterful director - he doesn't tell you what to think, but he certainly gets you thinking! Interestingly, for whateverreason, after I finished watching the film I didn't feel that much of anything. But the next day... <br /> <br />I have thought a great deal about many aspects of this film. If you'd like to discuss your impressions with me, drop me a line through Amazon Friends. I'd be especially interested to hear from people who have lived similar lives to those portrayed in the movie. <br /> <br />Regards and peace to all...
B000BJS4BM|1.0|Honestly, I have asked everybody who purchased this Special Edition CDs and even CD shopkeepers, they all said that all the Special Edition CDs will have scratches. Wonder what has happened to the record company...this is very unfair to customers who pay extra for the CD. Those who purchased this Special Edition CD, please check and you will see serious circled scratches.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Nowadays, many teens rely on music for their comfort.  Some find joy in hip-hop.  Others simply listen to whats on the radio.  We also have the emo kids and the goths.  Oh, and lest we forget the punks and sXe!  It's safe to say that genres now rule and 90% of people simply won't be openminded about their music.  It just isn't logical that a kid who worships Slipknot would hear about Kanye West's new CD and go out and purchase it on a whim.  The chances are second to none.  But I've found that every once in a while, a CD comes along that simply demands to be listened to.  Every blue moon some band or artist will release an album so magnificent and devestating that it simply cannot be refused.  Epic works like Mastodon's Leviathan album, which seized the metal genre and uprooted it from it's ground.  Or perhaps Glassjaw's Everything you ever wanted to know about silence?  The CD that even today holds it's own cult following for reinventing hardcore.   <br />I could go on for days about these few albums that have achieved such great status, but since this review is about only one CD, I'll stop at that. <br /> <br />It's rare that heavy music can ever be regarded as catchy.  There's no pop hooks or sing along choruses to get you into it.  Thus, we must face the fact that heavy music (heavy metal, hardcore, and any other core) will never take the lead in mainstream music.  I believe however, that Jane Doe is the CD that could have done this, and Converge is the only band that could have pulled it off.  I can't think of a single genuine hardcore CD that is as innovative and epic as this.  Of course it makes since that Converge would have done this.  After all, they are regarded as the best hardcore/metalcore band of the 90's.  Songs like \\"The Saddest Day\\" gave them trumendous prestidge in the scene.  Along with their frontman Jacob Bannon, an artist and college proffesor who just looks like he's pissed at the world.  The news of their live energy passed on and by 97' they were damn near close to taking the hardcore crown of the decade.  Today, many people consider them to be legends.  Their technicality cannot be denied.  Even bands like Dillenger escape plan are trying to keep up with the tempo changes that Converge made so famous.  Bannon's distorted scream is so chaotic that any attempt at making out the lyrics is completely nullified even with the words at hand. <br /> <br />Before I start my review, I need to urge you to go out and buy this album right now.  The Booklet alone is worth whatever you'll pay for it.  You won't be dissapointed and wish you would have downloaded, as I myself would be proud to say I own this peice of art.   <br /> <br />So finally here we are...no one but you, me, and this CD.  Where do I begin?  Well, Jane Doe is an album entirely about an unidentified female body, if the title didn't give it away.  In fact this is the same female body that supposedly ruined Bannon's life.  These songs have been described as a huge hunk of emotional garbage.  It sounds like it too.  The emotion in bannon's voice is unmistakable...almost inhuman.  I'm not kidding here guys.  Some of the vocals here are suspiciously animal like.  Which is weird considering the only VOX effect he used was distortion.  Clearly he has some mixed up brutality complex going on in his head to produce something this crazy.  If you want to know what I mean then listen to \\"Phoenix In Flames\\".  This song is just drums and vocals but is comparable only to a jaguar fight.  Literally, that's what it sounds like.   <br /> <br />Converge as usual, come out swinging with a massive beast of a song.  Concubine...  This song has probably the longest breakdown I've ever heard.  It's at least 10 seconds long.  The double bass used here is phenomenal.  It's got more tempo changes in it's one minute bag of tricks than other songs that last five.  As soon as you think it's over, you'll be proved wrong though...as the song immediately cuts into \\"Fault and Fracture\\".  This song can only be described as classic Converge.  It's that simple.  Next, you'll be greated by what seems like a more mellow but jumpy song.  \\"Distance and Meaning\\" almost sounds sort of dancable yet evil in nature, however it's malice soon shows as it's chorus is unveiled.   <br />All the sudden a WALL of distorted noise will crash into your ears.  I jumped when I first heard it.   <br />Finally, the album gives us a break after roughly 8-10 minutes of chaos, \\"hell to pay\\" comes on.  This song is pretty bass heavy and has a way of creeping around you.  It seems to me that this is Bannon's idea of a mind game with the listener.  Every new instrument that's introduced during select intervals of the song threatens to speed it up and slaughter your ears.  Fortunately though, the song ends jokingly enough...with no real harm done!  I myself was relieved to be rid of it.  But OH!  I was far from out of the fire.  All the sudden a screech of distortion appears, introducing the earth shattering, yer catchy as hell \\"Homewrecker\\"   <br />This song is probably my personal favorite off the album, as it combines Converge's obvious influence with old school punk rock.  I love it! <br /> <br />Next comes \\"The Broken Vow\\" a song that can't seem to decide if it wants to go all out like the rest or become something slower.  Even still,  it's a mammoth song that shouldn't be overlooked.   <br />\\"Bitter and Then Some\\" follows after sounding almost metally.  But that doesn't in any way keep it from ripping out your spine.  \\"heaven in Her Arms\\" is another Converge classic about love of all things.  Finally, we get to the album's showcase of sorts.  The two phoenix songs.  In a nutshell this is 4 minutes of slow distored art guitars, followed by one minute of pure hell.   <br /> <br />So we've made it to the end of the CD.  Only two tracks to go?  yes...but converge has obviously saved some of the best for last.   <br />\\"Thaw\\" is an instant classic in it's own right.  The tempo changes combined with the vocals are simply awe inspiring and sickining.   <br />It's majesty could only be followed by the title track though...   <br />She starts slow and ends frantically.  That's all I can say about Jane Doe.  Some parts will rip you and some will soothe you...but in any case it will end the album and you'll probably end like me, being compelled to buy the entire Converge Catolouge because your going to be addicted to the band forever.
B00097DX3U|3.0|This is about the 7 or 8th album I have checked out today but it is the best one. Don't take that as me complementing this album a whole lot though. It's more about how awful the other albums have been more than anything else. This album should get a listen just for the simple fact that these guys actually try not to make every single freakin song sound the same period. And when you are reviewing stuff from this particular brand of radio rock that is hard to do. At least Tom Morello creates different sounds on the guitar in some of these songs, and has some killer riffs in acouple of others. Compare this to the guitar work in bands like Banking Benjamins, Nicklehag, or Dis-turd. For people who don't listen to crappy music that would be Breaking Benjamin, nickleback and Disturbed. Wouldn't want anybody to go out and accidently buy these bands music without me giving you fair warning. Back to this record. Oh well I think I pretty much summed it up. Average. Go buy Rage, or the first two Soundgarden albums instead
B0009WFFS6|5.0|this is my number one dvd of 2005, these guys are just so solid musically, and clapton is just playing some of the most perfect leads. my favorite song is outside woman blues with ginger and jack laying down a perfectly lazy blues shuffle and eric's voice and solo carrying the day. the camera work and sound are stunning, as other reviewers have said it is almost like you are there live. and the great brian may nodding his head in approval during eric's solo on crossroads. like the brits would say,\\"good on ya cream\\"!
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|This album has allready been written hasn't it? over 15 years ago Anthrax came out with a little ep I think called I'm the man! I mean this is a comedy album isn't it? These guys are a freakin joke. I actually listened to every song all the way through though just because I couldn't stop laughing, it was really alot of fun. But really I think the joke is on everybody who buys this pile of crap. Who is laughing now you ask? Well that little giggle you hear is SOAD laughing all the way to the bank.
B000687M48|3.0|As another reviewer stated this is really just Fallen live in concert and if you're a fan and want to see Amy Lee and the other guys you can't remember then you'll enjoy this concert cd/dvd.  Yeah, some of the songs don't have as much power live as they do in the studio and Amy sings out of tune once or twice but it's still worth sitting thru if you like the Fallen album.  Just don't be surprised if you like the studio versions better.    As a bonus you also get all the great music videos and a mostly unnecessary documentary showing the band screwing around and having fun.  There's even a goofy cameo of the Seether guy that Amy eventually dumped.  It's a trainwreck and somewhat interesting to watch but kind of destroys the serious musician/artist image you have in your head while listening to this dark beautiful music.  Yeah, I know Amy Lee is really a typical normal goth girl (with a ton of money now) and the band can scarf a lot of cheeseburgers and beer but that doesn't mean we should see it.

B000002MY3|5.0|I've loved Alanis Morissette ever since my mom introduced me to her music at age six. Sure I like Under Rug Swept, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, and So Called Chaos, but Jagged Little Pill will always be the album that sticks out in my mind. It's angry, dark, and very, very catchy.  <br /> <br />All I really want-I love the lyrics. They're so clever and somehow always manage to make me smile. Some of the vocals in this song are slightly strange, but it's still an overall great song. <br /> <br />Forgiven-Not exactly my favorite song on the album, but likeable nonetheless.  <br /> <br />Hand in my Pocket-Extremely catchy. This song'll get stuck in your head, easy. When you hear this on the radio, you'll notice they edit it, but it's not that bad. <br /> <br />Head over Feet-This song never did seem to fit with the whole \\"Angry-Alanis\\" theme. But ever since I was six, this has been my favorite Alanis Morissete song. I still love it to death. <br /> <br />Ironic-Some people will tell you the lyrics don't really illustrate irony, but just inconvenieces. Who cares? Excellent song. <br /> <br />Mary Jane-Ah, I love the vocals in this song. I've yet to figure out the deeper meaning behind the lyrics, but I find it hard to dislike. <br /> <br />Not the Doctor-\\"...visiting hours are nine to five...\\" and I'm listening up till 12. Haha, that was pretty lame,but I just couldn't resist. To the point: great track. <br /> <br />Perfect-This song has always kind of bugged me. I have no idea why, but it does. <br /> <br />Right Through You-One of Alanis's best songs. There's a small amount of swearing, but it's pretty mild. <br /> <br />Wake Up-Out of everyone I've talked to, I'm the only one who sincerely loves this song. I admit I didn't like it at first, but it's grown on me. <br /> <br />You Learn-Awesome song. \\"You live, you learn, you love, you learn...\\" <br /> <br />You Oughta Know-I've gotta say, this may just be the most rockin' song on here. My only complaint is whenAlanis drops the f-bomb. That kinda ruined it for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|In short, if you are a fan of the Firefly series, you will love this movie. If you were not a fan or haven't seen it, you will probably still enjoy this movie, even though it helps to know more background on the characters at times.  <br /> <br />While I really enjoyed the movie, it in my opinion was lacking some of the original magic, that made \\"Firefly\\" the cult hit that it became. However, we need to keep in mind that Joss has stated on several occasions the \\"Studio\\" flexed a lot of their muscle in the outcome, and compromises had to be made. This is the same studio that took a great series and failed to give it a home in a proper time slot and ignored creators recommendations. Hell they didn't even air the episodes in proper order. <br /> <br />If you love Firefly the series, you must own this movie.
B0006399FS|5.0|when artists age in the music business, its easy for people to write off \\"new\\" material.  in the case of paul mccartney, or the stones, this is true.  in the case of U2, it is not.  this album is amazingly strong and holds its own in the U2 discography.   <br /> <br />the irish rockers are still loud, energetic, bossy and hopeful about the world of music they inhabit. track 5 \\"city of blinding lights\\" has that pulsating rhythm that bursts with enthusiasm (best listened to while driving the open road on a brilliantly sunny day) and promise of good things to come.  \\"The more you see the less you know <br />The less you find out as you go <br />I knew much more then than I do now\\" <br /> <br />maybe its cool to hate them, their incredible music, their humanitarian efforts, and their sense of hope, but you're kidding yourself if you believe that.  sometimes, its okay to like established stars, enjoy good music, and embrace hope for the world you inhabit via song.   <br /> <br />i was prepared to be skeptical and instead i was pleasantly surprised.  solid work u2, and congrats on the grammys - you earned those on artistic merit, not industry pity for all the missed awards of the past.
1400031087|2.0|I enjoyed this book as it is really nonstop action. It has a powerful edge to it and makes the reader see the raw humanity inside all of us. No doubt it strikes a chord. However, I don't understand why the author had to make up most of it. I get that his real story is most likely boring and would not have been published, but to lie and say it was all true??? How did he not think it would bite him later? Anyone that reads it is going to question it. No one could have that many crazy things happen to them. None of the addicts he met in rehab could have possibly been real. I mean, come on! It is entertaining and hard to put down. It made me cry and laugh. I just wish he had not lied about himself. That is the worst betrayal. Making up colorful characters and drama is one thing, but he is not really who he claims to be, which is sad, because I liked him. I rooted for him. I admired him. Now I think he's a big fat wuss who only thought of the bucks, and I won't bother with his sequel. How can his own family not be sickened by his lies? Oh, and the fact that Lilly, the girl he meets in rehab, who is madly in love with him, kills herself on the very day he gets out of prison,how lame.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|from the first strains of sound, this album delivers.  for me, personally, it stands out with a sound different from the standards of the day, which is a good thing.  this album makes me feel like i am part of a story and i want to travel to the end to see where i sonically go.   <br /> <br />worthy of your ears and your time (and your money)
B000B2YQX4|5.0|One of Depeche Mode's finest! These guys only get better with age. Very sorry they passed up Cleveland, Ohio on tour. <br />
B0006L16N8|1.0|they are so progressive.   <br />you cannot listen to the disc on a whole host of technologies.  u2 released their discography on iPod, but coldplay's newest won't stand for technological advances in music!   <br /> <br />fitting though, since their music has a \\"grandpa needs his metamucil\\" vibe.  rock music?  i think not.  the band's previous effort was a genuinely good album, but this x&y affair?  shameful.  once again martin trots out the \\"woe is me\\" whinny in depressing fashion...is there not apple of you eye chris?  why so sad?  this disc was dumped on me by a disappointed fan who deemed it \\"unlistenable\\" to which i replied \\"that seems extreme\\" but then i played it.   <br /> <br />drivel.  each track advance quashes the promise of living up to the hype, as imbecilic lyrics trip through unimaginative musical scoring.  coldplay has talented musicians, but they don't show up for this album.  the disproportionate amount of hype has truly been a disservice to music in the year 2005.  better music was made, but the wet blanket songs of coldplay were passively and lazily accepted by radio and reviewer's who i doubt are keeping this disc in their cd players.   <br /> <br />for a laugh i dare you to listen to \\"fix you\\" for its entirety.
B000A2H8WQ|5.0|This is by far Quincy Jones's best effort!  And that's saying alot when you consider his other  masterpieces of jazz / pop fusion:  1978's \\"Sounds & Stuff Like That!\\" one of my all-time faves!  and a close second to that is 1980's \\"The Dude\\",   which, like this one, is just chucked with classic   performances! The whole concept of old school   merging with new school and vice versa has   always really been kind of what Q is about,   but this is his most realized effort.  The late great Sarah Vaughn (Sassy) did her last great performance on this album,   the beautiful and serene brazilian flavored   \\"Setembre\\" which just takes my breath away!    Little Tevin Campbell debuts on this one with the  cheerful and brilliant \\"Tommorow (Better You, Better Me)\\"  which showed his promise as a gifted young singer.  Sadly, after the little scandal of a few years ago,   poor Tevin has had a hard time getting his momentum back.  Some people's ignorance and intolerance is amazing!  The guy is talented!..Period!...That's all that should factor  in when you purchase his or any other artist's material!    As I've said there are many great performaces on this CD,  but by far...\\"Secret Garden\\" is and was an immediate   quiet storm classic and the reason for a slight swell   in birth rates in 1989 and 1990!    Talk about a hall of fame of vocalists   and musicians!--whew!!     You can't go wrong with this one!
B000001Y5J|5.0|NINE INCH NAILS - Broken <br />- <br />I figured I'd take a trip back in time... And give this masterpiece a review. <br />BROKEN is as Aggressive as it is Flawless, Trent hit the mark with this beauty.  Six songs included as the EP and 2 bonus tracks `Physical' and `Suck'.  <br />Everything about this album rocks... Not to mention that they are all amazing tracks but more so it seems that the `flow' of the album is perfect. <br />I mean from the opener of `Pinion' which goes into the viciously crafted `Wish'...  The track that seems to be least talked about is `Last' which is very underrated... probably because it follows one of NIN's biggest hit.  Then the eerie `Help me I'm in Hell' leads into disturbing ly heavy `Happiness in Slavery' and to close it off the stunning `Gave-Up' Which to this day is still one of my favorite songs of all time... <br />As far as the bonus tracks go Physical is fun little track which, I believe, is a Queen cover?!?  And Suck is funk-tastically amazing, a song which was written for a band called PigFace - A side-project which Trent had been briefly involved in.   <br /> <br />Broken may not be quite my favorite NIN album (That honour goes to either `The Fragile' or `Downward Spiral') but it certainly is the heaviest...  <br />Favorite Songs:  Gave-Up, Wish, and Suck. <br />-5 Stars. <br />
0553801503|4.0|I know like a lot of fans we were a little disappointed not to see more of the rest of the characters.

EXTENDING THE SERIES TO UNCOUNTABLE BOOKS...this book starts to pull strings down and shows a brief glimpse of where things might be going, but I guess we wont find out at least in two books more so...please mr Martin, give us a fantastic finally that we can enjoy before the end of this decade. I gave up on Jordan....
B00005YXZH|5.0|i love this album. the first time i heard it i didn't get it, but i kept after it, and then listened to it over & over for a 900 mile road trip. I am this moment watching \\"i am trying to break your heart\\"- and i didn't realize that their label, reprise, dropped them immediately after Wilco delivered the finished album. So i wanted to write this review to say, what total morons. Or rather, what shallow, disgusting suits who shouldn't be in the music business. Thank god another label(nonesuch, great label) picked it up.<br /><br />buy this record. listen to it, really listen. with headphones. for days. you'll love it.
B00082IJ08|4.0|When I first heard of Gorillaz I had to grimace- Hollyweird is so incredibly phony that they have once again resorted to using pretty looking front men to cover up for apparently dumpy looking artists.  The artists with the actual talent behind Milli Vanilli clearly had talent since they won the Grammy, but you will never know their names because of those two drug addicts the producer dredged up grabbing all the spotlight, but at least they were human.  THIS bunch are unapologetically presented as cartoons! <br /> <br />BUT...after stumbling over a Gorillaz music video I had to reconsider.  This wasn't a case of resorting to cartoons to cover up camera-unfriendly performers, the cartoon front men were just part of the presentation.  Using cartoons is actually meant to be a single part of an entire Gorillaz entertainment experience, like dancers, singers and musicians all coming together and supporting each other in a musical. I began to judge them in a new light.... <br /> <br />...and what I heard was perhaps the most refreshingly original group I've seen in a long time.  Yes, they are cartoons, and yes, the artists behind the curtain are people you'll never hear about, but once you get past that, their music is fresh and full of energy (I.E. Dare), and has a mesmerizing base (I.E. Feel Good), and can sometimes be downright strange (I.E. Fire coming out of a Monkey's Head).  Their videos are fun, too, with the head of Shaun Ryder (of Happy Mondays fame) strung up like a giant Frankenstein's monster in the Dare video.   <br /> <br />Also, if you go to their website ([...]) you will simply crack up laughing at the stories they invented for these characters (Russel is possessed by ghosts and Murdoc used to set fire to cats?!?  Where do they get this stuff from?). <br /> <br />Regrettably, I hear that the human artists behind this album are completely different from the artists behind their debut album, telling me that the producers consider the actual performers to bedisposable.  Such heartlessness makes me deprive this group of a star, but hey, the end product is still worthy of it being in your collection.  Just be sure to catch all the rest of the experience through their videos and their website to get the full Gorillaz experience.   <br /> <br />This group may be many things, but they are certainly not dull.

B001CC7PP8|5.0|PSYCHO  1960 / 109 min. / B&W  Alfred Hitchcock was in his late 50's when he set out to make Psycho. This was a film that - before changing the course of filmmaking - did not want to be made by the studio. So, Hitchcock would ultimately foot the bill to the tune of $800,000 to get the film made. It was certainly a far cry from the lavish productions of previous efforts like Vertigo and North by Northwest, but that was the point. Hitchcock had the strong desire to make a cheaper, darker and edgier film then he ever had before. So, after anonymously purchasing the rights to Robert Bloch's novel for a mere $9000, it was decided that Psycho would be just that film, and in the end, it was to become Hitchcock's most famous and successful film.  While most plot synopsis for Psycho are rather vague or even uneventful, it is so much more than what it appears to be. It is rich in symbolism and foreshadowing that is expertly enhanced by Hitchcock's brilliant stylistic approach. It deals with countless themes such as voyeurism, duality, sexual bluntness, and of course, shocking violence. It tackled on numerous taboos with dialogue and/or images all the while pushing the censors to its absolute limits.  All of this, of course, is enhanced not only by Bernard Hermann's amazing musical score or the tremendous production design but by Anthony Perkins' performance of Norman Bates. Whether he's stammering on words like `falsity' or cleaning up a crime scene, Perkins owns the screen. It is arguably horror's greatest performance. Thankfully, he is surrounded by the likes of some talented actors like Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and Martin Balsam. And while many will rightfully call attention to the iconic shower scene, for me, the one-on-one scenes of Bates and Marion Crane or Bates and Detective Arbogast are some of the major highlights of the film. The way those scenes were written, acted and shot is just incredible stuff.  It is amazing to think that Psycho - which only earned four Oscarnominations - did not garner nods for Best Picture, Musical Score and Best Actor. In fact, after the announcing of the nominations, Hitchcock sent a letter to Perkins that stated, \\"I am ashamed of your fellow actors.\\" And he had every right to be. It is one of cinema's greatest performances.  The 2-disc digitally re-mastered release of Psycho offers up all that has been previously available - including the fabulous feature-length documentary, The Making of Psycho - as well as some new goodies to enjoy. The best addition would have to be the thoroughly insightful audio commentary by author Stephen Rebello. It's particularly interesting when he discusses how audiences originally reacted to first seeing the film. There's also a new featurette, interview excerpts, and an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Not to mention the carry-over of newsreel footage, storyboards, behind the scenes pics, production notes and a few other treats. It's a wholly satisfying release that should be scooped up by any and all horror fans.
0140557741|4.0|Though he's illustrated books for other authors before this, it was really with \\"Zoom\\" that artist Istvan Banyai first tried his hand at the wide world of children's picture books.  Do a quick Google search of Banyai and you'll see that the man has dipped his toe in everything from book illustrations to pictures for Playboy.  Now as a children's librarian I am always on the lookout for good wordless picture books.  The wordlessier they are the better.  My favorites up until now have been titles like \\"The Boy, the Bear, the Baron, and the Bard\\" by Gregory Rogers and \\"Anno's Journey\\" by Mr. Mitsumasa Anno himself.  In light of his more recent efforts (\\"The Other Side\\" comes to mind) it's funny to see how simple his books were at the start.  \\"Zoom\\" is not a particularly new idea for a book, but it is a fun concept and is sure to garner itself some solid fans throughout the years.<br /><br />The very first thing you see, on opening the book, is a fleshy and pointed starfish-like creature, but with too many points.  Turn the page and the next image is of that same pointy image, but we can see that it's actually the crest of a rooster's comb.  Turn the page again and we back up even farther still. Now the rooster is seen perched on a fence while two captivated youngsters look on.  You get the gist of the book.  The thing is, Banayi keeps backing up, even when you think that there would be nowhere else to go.  A farm scene suddenly becomes a toy farm set with a child playing with it.  A city street becomes a television program.  And a cruise ship resolves itself to be an ad on the side of a bus.  As the book backs off farther and farther and farther, in the end the earth recedes until it is only a single white dot in the center of a very black page.  Want your kids to grasp the concept of their own inherent insignificance in the face of a vast unyielding universe?  Then \\"Zoom\\"'s the book for you!<br /><br />It took me a little while to realize it, but the book that bears the closest resemblance to \\"Zoom\\" is Barbara Lehman's Caldecott Honor winner, \\"The Red Book\\".  Of course, the advantage of \\"The Red Book\\" is that it actually had a plot of sorts.  \\"Zoom\\", for all its charms, is plotless.  In some ways, the best wordless picture books are the ones that dare to tell some kind of a tale.  \\"Home\\" by Jeannie Baker, for example, told the story of a girl's life from birth to adulthood and how the world changes around her.  As Banyai becomes more comfortable with creating children's books he begins to understand their purpose.  Therefore \\"The Other Side\\" has an ending that summarizes nicely whereas \\"Zoom\\" simply drifts off into space.<br /><br />Which isn't to say that the book is poorly done.  It ain't.  Using his customary thin thin black pen lines and a palette of all sorts of colors, Banyai brings to life everything from the hypnotic eye of a rooster to New York's Flatiron Building.  Unfortunately for me, the version of \\"Zoom\\" that I am reviewing is the paperback edition.  This is a real shame as I've been delighted by Banyai's small touches and flourishes made to his books' covers and bookflaps.  If it comes down to purchasing the hardcover edition of this story or the paperback, I highly urge you to consider the hardcover.  Though I can't vouch for whether or not there are any fun details attached to it, why take the chance?  Besides, when it comes to viewing Banyai's books with true appreciation, only hardcover will possibly do.<br /><br />As with most high-concept picture book, \\"Zoom\\" isn't aiming to be universally beloved.  It will instead be enjoyed primarily by those children of the correct mindset.  Some kids will get a huge kick out of the perpetually shifting realities captured in this minute little booklet.  Others will be weirded out by the concept and clutch their \\"Dora the Explorer\\" paperbacks a little tighter to their chests.  I sincerely hope your child is in the former category.  \\"Zoom\\" certainly deserves to be looked atand makes a fine addition to anyone's wordless picture book collection.looked at and makes a fine addition to anyone's wordless picture book collection.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|In interview frontman Josh Homme said that he knows he does not have your typical rock voice, so maybe thats why he hides behind a lot of distortion, but either way, he's right, but only to a degree.  So no he doesn't have your heavy metal screaming voice, and he doesn't have your melodic singing voice, but his voice is distinct and thats what makes QotSA so unique.  They don't sound like anyone else but themselves and that saves them from being swept under the rug.  I'll admitt that I was not a fan initially but after listening to 'Burn the Witch' i was intrigued and so I decided to purchase the album and give it a spin.  Starting things off with an eerie opener, calm and settling, \\"THIS LULLABY\\" sparked my interest.  I know knew that this was not your average conventional band.  \\"MEDICATION\\" was blistering yet short, but it was \\"TANGLED UP IN PLAID\\" that struck a cord with me.  It's sweet melody is intoxicating and a joy to listen to, and Josh's voice is a soft compliment.  This is a deffinate stand out track.  \\"BURN THE WITCH\\" is great, the remix though off the Saw II soundtrack is better... \\"LITTLE SISTER\\" is one everyone has heard, and is a decent track but not my favorite.  I think it's about prostitution...listen to it, I think you get it.  \\"SKIN ON SKIN\\" is a sick perverted love song and I like it...kudos there guys.  Not sisnce Godsmacks \\"MOONBABY\\" has a love song made me feel dirty like that.  \\"SOMEONES IN THE WOLF\\" is a creepy dark and ominous track and the vocal talents of Garbage's Shirley Manson and The Distillers Brody Dalle gracing the track \\"YOU GOT A KILLER SCENE, MAN...\\" is a welcome blessing.  I love Shirley, she rocks.  \\"LONG SLOW GOODBYE\\" is a great way to close the album, soft and relaxing and welcoming to say the least.  It's a good track to make you want to hit replay.  Anyways, it's not to say that the album is flawless, for some of the tracks tend to sound repetitive, BUT, don't most albums.  Anyways, I was plesently surprised upon purchasing this album, so surprised that I may even bye \\"SONGS FOR THE DEAF\\" and test drive that album.  All in due time my friend, all in due time.

Ira Levin does not waste a single word.  He gets right to the point and holds you there!!  This book made me want to read everything that Ira Levin has ever written.  Fantastic!!  If you like great suspense, psychological thrillers and stories with a twist...this book is definately for you!
B000025XKM|5.0|Released in 1972, this wonderful (yet short 28'29\\") album of acoustic music by English singer/songwriter Nick Drake is haunting and sad, yet is also quite hopeful.  Based on what I have read, the album was recorded in a mere 4 hours, which was spread across two sessions that each started at midnight and lasted until 2 am.  Instrumentation on the album is sparse, and apart from Nick's husky and warm voice, the only instruments used include acoustic guitar (very unusual tunings are used), with rare sprinkles of acoustic piano here and there.  Nick's acoustic guitar playing is quite good and alternates folk-like strumming with some virtuosic, right-hand finger picking (some of Michael Hedges quieter, delicate, and less busy pieces come to mind).  The piece Know is fairly interesting because it features a repeated four note pattern on the acoustic guitar over which Nick sings - this \\"minimalist\\" approach stands in stark contrast to the comparatively more involved playing on the other pieces.  A quick glance through the lyrics suggests a lingering sadness and hints of self doubt, although the music itself and the attention that went into crafting each piece suggest that Nick loved his music very much.  This remastered CD features pictures of Nick, along with the lyrics and photos of his original notes made during the writing process.  Sadly, this was to be his last album before his untimely death in 1974 of an overdose of antidepressants.  Other studio albums by Nick Drake include Five Leaves Left (1969) and Bryer Later (1970), which feature a wider variety of instruments and are not as stripped down as Pink Moon.  Very highly recommended.
0316172324|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is about decision making, in particular about making decisions on the spur of the moment. Gladwell's contention is that, however counterintuitive it may be, snap decisions are very often superior to those resulting from long hours of thought and research: having too much information, it turns out, can impede decision making. The trick is that the person dong the deciding must be sufficiently informed about a topic that he can, consciously or not, isolate the salient factors in a given situation, disregarding extraneous information, and come to a conclusion based on them, a process known as \\"thin-slicing.\\"<br /><br />Gladwell peppers his book with intriguing examples of real-life thin-slicing: a fireman's snap decision while spraying flames in a burning kitchen to order his men out of the building--moments before the floor collapses; the immediate certainty of a number of art experts upon looking at a particular statue, a Greek kouros which exhaustive tests had indicated was genuine, that it is in fact a modern forgery--a suspicion later proved correct. In these cases the experts could not explain at once the reasons for their snap decisions. Their unconscious minds had sifted through enormous amounts of information--about the fire's behavior and sound, for example--and had spat out a conclusion--the floor is about to collapse--without their being aware of the thought process. The examples Gladwell unpacks for us are unusually dramatic, but in fact we thin-slice all the time, when we interpret people's facial expressions, or decide whether a potential suitor is desirable or not, or determine whether it's safe to cross a heavily trafficked street.<br /><br />Snap decisions, Blackwell demonstrates, can be very powerful, but they can also sometimes be very wrong. Gladwell explains how stress and the weight of our prior associations with what we're observing can pervert our first impressions. It is in this context that Gladwell discusses the police shooting of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx in 1999, a tragic case of individuals in a stressful situation being unable to \\"mind read,\\" to properly discern another's intent from his behavior and facial expressions.<br /><br />If my explanation of Gladwell's argument has been at all dry, then I have done his book a disservice. Blink is a simply fascinating read, studded with little mysteries--about military strategy and emergency rooms and Warren Harding and the Pepsi Challenge and innumerable other topics--that will keep readers glued to the page. Blink is also well researched and well argued and--and I don't say this lightly--stylistically flawless.

0786889284|4.0|I rate this crime book an A-. The story was interesting as well as the investigation techiques presented. I didn't bond with the lead investigators. I did feel sympathy for some of the characters. Three women are killed in arson fires that burn so hot that very little is left. Meanwhile, there is a boy who lives with an abusive stepfather. The boy has a relationship with a kind pyschic .The boy's story and the fires come together. For its lenght, this book is a quick read. This novel however, could have been edited more.This was my first Ridley Pearson novel and I would read him again.

B000002ADT|5.0|If you own 2 or more jazz discs in your collection, this should be one of them.  (the other should be a Coltrane- A Love Supreme or My Favorite Things). Miles Davis had many fine hours but this is his best. His band here is perfect with John Coltrane using this as a launch into his very successful solo career. Each cut works on its own or as a piece of the album. \\"So What\\" has been covered many times and deservedly so. If you don't like this, you just don't like jazz.

B0006399FS|5.0|After 25 years, U2 is still hungry. This CD deserves to be placed among the band's best works. Vertigo is a great rocker and a neat opener. There's anumber of classic U2 cuts here such as All Because of You, Sometimes you can't make it on your own, and A man and a woman.  <br />Is this u2's best CD? They have made so many good ones that it's going to be a matter of opinion but I would rank this just slightly below Achtung Baby and slightly above their earlier work in the first half of the 1980's. Any way you cut it, this is a fine vintage work. <br />
B00003CWNR|4.0|there are few movies [with mainstream actors] that truly leave you thinking. i should rephrase -- there are few movies that leave you thinking & are enjoyable to watch. i thought that the cider house rules was exceptional. from the first scene, i was utterly and completely captivated. The filming was expertly done; if you like new england, you should watch this movie simply for the visuals. tobey maguire has always been one of my favorite actors, but i thought that his performance in this movie was stellar. It set him apart from other young Hollywood stars. The man honestly has talent! In fact, the whole cast was primo, right down to the children who were the orphans [watch for fuzzy & curly; both were heartbreakingly adorable]. Charlize Theron, who i have always thought was simply a mediocre actress, proved me completely wrong.  <br />There are many issues in this movie that could be scrutinized; you have to be willing to watch it with an open mind. Abortion is a huge controversy throughout the plot -- if yu're completely offended by it, then you probably won't enjoy this movie. however, i think that it was a moving film with an important message.

B000BTDMDC|5.0|The feeling you get when you first listen to this cd is that this is the first giant step for a new group which has come here to stay. The taste of punk rock is very strong in each song but it doesn't remind of the past at all. The two guitars from Alex Tuner and Jamie Cook take you to a new dimension where you recognize  the pure talent combined with the hard work. The second thing that you realize on the second reading is the rhythm section background from Matt Helders and Andy Nicholson with a very deep and inspired way supporting the two guitars.<br /><br />As the music goes on song after song you understand that these four young people from Sheffield just opened a new page in the rock history. We were right to wait for this masterpiece to be released. The free demos that the group released in internet gave us the right impression for the profile of this Sheffield attack. I bet that the older listener will remember Neil Young's lyrics \\"hey hey my my rock 'n roll will never die\\"

0684824906|5.0|Sorry Ms. Goodwin did not satisfy those that wanted a concise history of the civil war, its generals and battles.  This is not that.  This contains insight into the inner workings of the cabinet and an interesting view of wartime Washington.  It does not overdue his wife Mary or his melancholy as beat to death by the history channel.  She presents a multiple biography of those closest to the greatest president in American history.  I sit back and shudder at the thought of some of our modern preseidents, Bush and Clinton for example, leading us through this crisis.  Ms. Goodwin presents his humanity and his shrewdness which got us through these dark days.  This is a long read, great for cold winter nites.  When you are done, I believe you can honestly say you learned something and have a better view of the man and the times.  There are few books like this out there.  Great job Doris.
0425188809|5.0|This is by far my favorite Dean Koontz novel.  The premise: a laboratory conducting illegal genetic research has produced its two greatest accomplishments- a dog with the intelligence of a human (and he's psychic) and a crazed psychopathic creature with an insatiable appetite for human blood.  Both creatures escape; the creature begins his rampage while the dog is picked up by a guy with his own problems in life. It just gets better from there.  This novel follows in the vein of Koontz's latest novel Dragon Tears (review to come later) and only displays Koontz's writing prowess.  I read this book in about three hours and you probably will, too.  Dean Koontz has done it again... written a novel that isn't just a passing fad.  Adios and happy reading.

I purchased Trout Mask Replica before this and was mildly impressed with its excentric, strange compositions. On Safe as Milk the songs are, well, more song driven witch gives its experiments more structure, and allows the same amount of both wierdness and rhapsody to inhabit the same space. There is to much to say about this album, buy it for yourself and you will realize. <br />.....zig zag......

B000BI0WOA|5.0|If you could only own one Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler album this is the one.  What you have here on two CDS is a baker's dozen of Straits songs, two of Knopfler's movie themes, six Knopfler solo tunes, and a first-time-heard duet with Emmylou Harris.  Total: 140 minutes of music -- which is about as much as you can cram onto two CDs.         You could complain about the song selection.  I would have liked to have seen \\"Railroad Work Song\\" from the Notting Hillbillies on which Knopfler plays guitar as well as anyone in the world ever has. And a tune from his CD with Chet Atkins would be nice too.  But most of Dire Strait's best are here.  \\"Brothers in Arms\\" is awe-inspiring and sad; \\"Telegraph Road\\" is a 14-minute epic of brilliant guitar solos; \\"Sultans of Swing\\" is the all time Dire Straits favorite with a chugging beat that can't be beat; \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is a quirky love song played on that weird steel guitar that Knopfler loves. And of course you've gotta include the head-banging \\"Money for Nothing\\" because it's famous -- and famously overplayed.        Knopfler's more recent solo efforts are a bit quieter and may not be as well known.  \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" is a wondrous duet with James Taylor; \\"What Aye Man\\" is a sea chanty with some fancy guitar licks.  There isn't a bad song here.     Knopfler writes clever,thoughtful songs, sings a bit like Bob Dylan, and plays a ringing but ethereal guitar.  This is quality rock music. One comment:  \\"Darling Pretty\\" is on the English version of the CD; on the American version it is replaced with \\"Skateaway.\\"      Smallchief

B000B19BCG|3.0|Supergrass is another one of those unfortunate bands that tends to get lost in the shuffle of all the other music out there. A lot of people would probably only remember them from that eye-popping Hammer & Tongs-directed video they had for \\"Pumping On Your Stereo\\". At any rate, the boys do a pretty decent job on their latest EP, Road to Rouen.<br /><br />I really don't think the album is as great as some of these other reviewers claim, though. I mean, they can still play, and \\"Roxy\\" and \\"Low C\\" are above-average, but nothing else really stands out; to be honest, this album contains a lot of three-and-a-half-star songs. Another thing is that some of the songs have too much music and not enough actual singing.<br /><br />While Supergrass didn't lay a brick with this album or anything, they'll have to do a tad better than this to get more consumers to notice them. But if you're already a fan of theirs, they didn't stray away from their style, so feel free to pick it up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000ANVQ0K|3.0|Just bought the 3-Disc edition. While watching Disc 1, in many scenes the speech was out of sync with the video. Anyone else notice it? The scene with the worst trouble was when Jack and Rose were walking on the promenade when she first irritatingly looked at his drawings. The speech was very noticeably early from the video. Yet other scenes were fine. Seems there were more problems at the beginning of the back-to-1912 scenes.  <br /> <br />I love the movie, by the way--one of my favorites. Just annoyed by the out of sync-ness.

0553802534|4.0|Lisa Gardner's \\"Alone\\" is an unputdownable chilling thriller that I managed to read in one very long sitting - with several pit stops and a pizza. One of the most unusual twists in this novel is that the cop/hero gets indicted on criminal charges for doing his job. What's up with that?<br /><br />Bobby Dodge is a dedicated member of the Massachusetts elite Special Tactics and Operation Team (STOP) and one of the most professional and highly regarded snipers in this SWAT-like force. Although he has been with the team for fifteen years and is used to being on call 24/7, he has never fired his rifle at a human being before. This all changes, however, when he is called to the scene of a domestic disturbance at the home of Jimmy and Catherine Gagnon. Looking out the fourth story bedroom window of the brownstone directly across the street from the Gagnon's home, State Trooper Dodge sees Mr. Gagnon holding his wife and small son at gunpoint and must use all his training to make a split-second life and death decision.<br /><br />In what he truly believes is a \\"righteous shooting,\\" Bobby Dodge pulls the trigger and fells James Gagnon, Jr. before the man can murder his wife. Dodge anticipates the obligatory paid administrative leave and the investigation that always follows such an incident, but he never expects to find himself in such seriously deep trouble, the kind that would destroy his life!<br /><br />Maryanne Gagnon, wife of Suffolk Superior Court Judge James Gagnon, and mother of the dead man, files a motion for a felony hearing with the clerk-magistrate almost immediately. Apparently anyone can seek a clerk-magistrate hearing for probable cause that  - \\"(a) a crime has been committed, and, (b) that the defendant did it. If the clerk-magistrate finds in favor of probable cause, then the clerk-magistrate can issue criminal charges against the defendant even though it's a civil court,\\" thereby bypassing the DA's office and pursuing their own criminal case with their own personal lawyer. The Gagnons accuse Dodge of murdering their son. And even though he is a state trooper, he is not protected under Massachusetts state law, as this is not a civil suit. Murder is a felony.<br /><br />The Gagnons also file to gain immediate custody of their sickly grandson, Nathan. They claim that Catherine is endangering the life of her boy, and had also instigated the murder of her husband by duping the sniper. And once stated, their suspicions and allegations become the readers'.<br /><br />In her adolescence, which was far from normal, Catherine Gagnon was known as the \\"Thanksgiving Miracle.\\" She was abducted by a pedophile when she was just twelve years-old, brutally abused and held prisoner for twenty-eight days. She was rescued right before the Thanksgiving holidays. Although irreparably damaged psychologically, she has tried to live as normal a life as possible. When she married Jimmy Gagon, the son of the wealthy and very powerful Boston judge, she thought she would never have to be afraid again. Not!<br /><br />At about this point in the plot Catherine's pedophile rapist gets out of jail, unexpectedly, to say the least. This event livens things up enough to provide a three-ring horror show.<br /><br />I was really intrigued by the enigmatic character of Cat Gagnon. She learned to become a champion manipulator as a preteen in order to survive. Now, as an adult, she is aware of her behavior, of her own psychology, and still does what she has to do in order to remain alive.<br /><br />Although Ms. Gardner's prose is overly florid at times, and her plot has a few too many convolutions, it makes for a terrific fast, fun, thrills and chills read.<br /><br />JANAheir own personal lawyer.

0395389496|4.0|This book is written and illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg.  In 1986, he received a Caldecott Medal for the \\"Polar Express\\".  He was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan on June 18, 1949.  He now lives in Providence, Rhode Island, with his wife Lisa, and two daughters Sophia and Anna.<br /><br /> \\"The Polar Express\\" is about a little boy whose faith in Santa Clause is slowly disappearing.  One Christmas Eve night, a magical train takes him and other children to the North Pole.  When they arrive, they meet Santa Clause and the magic begins.<br /><br /> In my opinion, I think this is a wonderful child's book.  It's fun to read, and keeps the children guessing what will happen next.  The illustrations are magnificent; they really bring the story to life.  I think it also teaches children to never loose faith in what they believe in, no matter what society might tell them.
0195067142|5.0|I can't add much to what has already been written except to agree that this is an incredible book. I've read it seven or eight times, and each time I'm impressed at how good it is (my wife read it and was equally impressed). If I could only have one book in my library about the personal experience of combat, this one would be it.<br /><br />I first read With the Old Breed in the early 1990s and was so taken with it I knew I had to speak to the author and tell him how much I enjoyed it. I tracked Dr. Sledge to his home in Alabama and gave him a call. We had a great conversation, with him filling me in on many details not in the book. I sent him a copy of the book to autograph, and when I got it back, I found that he had not only written a nice inscription, which I will always treasure, but had also annotated many of the photographs with his comments. I was deeply saddened to read of his death in 2001. He was an incredible man.
0571226167|4.0|This book really takes you along with this tortured soul's journey into madness.  I was amazed at how my own mind fell into the same confused patterns of the main character.  A testement to the outstanding writing skill of the author.  I think the experience is enhanced by researching and understanding a little about Plath before reading the book.
B000001ESP|5.0|So its 1981,I`m almost 14 years old and I`m making my first steps toward opening my mind as far as music was concerned.I was a Rush fan already but this is the disc...this is the only thing that mattered for months afterward and I cherish this album with all my heart.From the opening blast of Tom Sawyer to the final fadeout of Vital Signs,it is truely a classic.<br /><br />Great music and judging from the prices for this disc,it`s an incredible bargin.Buy it !!!!
0684874350|4.0|What did I expect from life in Ireland?  Not this book.  It was well written.  I am glad I read it.  But, it was depressing and I would forewarn those who think it will be anything different.  Read it but not if you are already in a funk.
B000002U9W|5.0|\\"ATOM HEART MOTHER? Are you on drugs son?\\" This was the typical reaction I would usually get when I would wear my ATOM HEART MOTHER T-shirt around; for the longest time my favorite T-shirt, because nobody knew what the hell it meant. Nowhere on the shirt did it ever say PINK FLOYD, so unless you were really into them, you just thought I was wearing some bizarre drug related thread. A cow on the front, and the bold words ATOM HEART MOTHER on the back.<br />The same can pretty much be said about the album itself. If you didn't know much about FLOYD, or never heard this before, you would have no clue it was them. You may think it is some sort of symphony record after listening to the opening 24 minute title track. The strangest FLOYD track of them all. This is something I will not bother trying to explain. However, are you on drugs, son?<br />On the opposite side of the scale, I'm sure that there are people out there that have NO IDEA who Pink Floyd are, and absolutely cherish this cow record, that maybe they picked up at a yard sale or something. It is like the score to some sort of Roman tragedy or something...<br />ANYWAY, theres more on this album too besides the suite. However, none of the songs on this album would I call favorites. The best one is called \\"IF.\\" This song can be noted as one of Roger Waters first \\"bleeding heart\\" type songs. It's pretty and has some good lyrics \\"if I go insane, please don't stick your needles in my brain,\\" but is sort of amateur writing compared to similar material he would come out with in later years. SUMMER 68 was written by RICHARD WRIGHT and is sort of bogus. FAT OLD SUN was written by GILMOURE, who at the time was sort of like the punk of the group, writing the bands edgier songs. That one is pretty good too.<br />Then lastly is ALANS PSYCHEDELIC BREAKFAST. Interesting peice of music, sort of like the opposite book end to the ATOM HEART SUITE, but again, are you SURE you're not on ANY drugs?<br />I like the instrumentals, but they are far from rock and roll. They are also far from the spaciness you may expect. I guess you just have to listen if you really don't know. You may be pleasantly suprised at what you find, but an open mind is definately necessary for this one.<br /><br />So, yeah, the last day I wore this T-shirt before it finally disinigrated into one giant hole, I was walking down the street, probably a little stoned, when this small, small, kid... I'm talking like three or four years old, rode up to me on a tricycle, looked at me for a second and then said \\"Cool, Pink Floyd.\\"<br /><br />Yes! That made my day.rock and roll.

B000000OU0|4.0|Some Live albums tend to be difficult to listen to as the recording can be poor or there is too much background noise.  This is definitely not the case for \\"Hell Freezes Over\\".  One of the greatest live albums I've heard, it's a definite must of Eagles fans.  A true testament that the band can withstand the test of time, I've never heard the songs sound so beautiful as they do on this album.  With the addition of newly recorded songs, it's hard to go without this album in your Eagles collection.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's missing some of my more favorite Eagles songs.
0140067477|3.0|I don't know, nor do I pretend to know, the intricate workings of Taoism. But then, I didn't set out to write a book. I'm merely writing a book review. <br /> <br />Benjamin Hoff, regardless of his knowing the intricate workings of Taoism, comes off as pretending. At the very least, he talks the talk but fails to walk the walk. How can I say that, given my self-announced lack of knowledge? Hoff explains, quite clearly, one of the tenets of Taoism is to accept things precisely as they are. He then goes on to reject the other Pooh characters as they are. Instead, he proceeds to disparage them for not having the simplicity of Pooh. Likewise, he starts his book by doing the same of other religions. <br /> <br />The book reads like it was originally written to be a Taoism for Dummies book. By adding Pooh, the book becomes much more than that for Hoff. The book is annoying at times, having parables that sometimes work, other times not; occasionally coming from random space and not speaking to the point at hand. The author assumes we just GET it. But isn't the point of the book to explain, to make clear what might not be obvious to those not immersed in the subject matter already? It's hard to believe this is anything but a book for beginners. As such, he should treat the reader as such. Other times the points are illustrated well with the Pooh stories. <br /> <br />The book is too judgmental and critical of those not accepting The Way, which is in direct conflict with another of the tenets of the book - Cottleston Pie, for those who have read it. This lack of acceptance is bothersome. Overall, I guess things are NOT what they are, in the mind of Benjamin Hoff. Additionally, Pooh is often times omniscient and judgmental, qualities I would never imagine to label the cute little guy. <br /> <br />Many of the ideas expressed in this book embody things I currently believe. The text often reinforces those beliefs, other times expands upon them. However, as mentioned above, it makes me wonder at the style of the message delivered. On one hand, it's probably a good intro to the subject matter, regardless of your religious & philosophical beliefs. On the other hand, the book can't be taken too seriously due to the blatant hacking at the philosophies and beliefs of others. Still, the core of the book does entail a much ideology that helps get a person through everyday life. So it's probably well worth the read if you take the good and ignore the bad.
B000068FUS|2.0|A band that tries to revive a musical style from the 1970's is going to struggle to bring it into modern times for the sake of reaching popular status.  Well, this album does not achieve that status.  One thing the album does do well is tell the story of Lynyrd Skynyrd.  What the album doesn't do well is being pleasing to the ear and easy to listen to.  I don't recommend this album unless you really want to hear it.  Besides all that, the CD case is a cardboard case without plastic CD holders, very cheap looking.  All in all, the entire production of the album seems very low-key and not well thought out.

0743454537|5.0|What would you do if you were responsible for someone else's life, your only sister's life?  For Anna Fitzgerald, this has been the question she has been faced with everyday of her life.  Anna's sister, Kate, was diagnosed with cancer when she was two years old.  No one in her family had he same DNA as her, and so her parents, Brian and Sara, were faced with the most difficult decision of their lives.  They could choose to let God decide When to take little Kate, or they could have another child born with the same DNA as Kate, and that is when Anna, basically a clone of Kate, comes into the world.  Even though, Anna is a healthy baby, she is rushed into surgery.  She gave bone marrow to her sister when she had only been born for a few minutes.  However, this would not be the last time Anna had to do this.  Throughout the book, Anna has to give her sister whatever she needs to survive.  However, when Kate needs a liver, Anna files a lawsuit saying she's tired of giving her sister everything and tired of being in the hospital. Then Anna has only one ultimate decision to decide: will she go against everyone she loves, and let her sister die?  Or will she give her the one thing that could save her life? <br /> One thing I liked about the book was how when Anna chose not to give her sister a liver, they weren't mad at each other, and they acted like nothing was wrong.  I also liked how they were like best friends throughout the whole book.  One thing I disliked was how the book ended. <br /> People who like to read a lot would like this book.  I say this because it is four-hundred and twenty-two pages, and because it is defiantly a page turner.  This book will keep you guessing with every turning page. <br />
B000002MJ0|5.0|I am one of the few who believe that \\"Isn't Anything\\" is leagues better than \\"Loveless\\". This is one of my favorite albums; therefore, it's one of the few albums I've actually purchased. \\"Isn't Anything\\" isn't really one of the most uplifting albums of all time, but it is undoubtedly original and I might even add, influencial.  <br /> <br />The lyrics are beautiful and heartfelt, the vocals are what really makes the album so dreamy. Kevin Shield's voice is like a blur, and I don't even know what a blur sounds like.  <br /> <br />\\"No More Sorry\\" is what really made the album for me, personally, it just flows very well. This isn't really an album you'd want to just listen to the drumsticks hit the drums and the pics hit the guitar, no, you should concentrate very hard on the lyrics. Maybe, you'll even pick up the messege 'My Bloody Valentine' are trying to send across. Of course though, that's a different messege for everyone.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I have been a DM fan since hearing \\"Violator\\" in the 1990's.  Depeche Mode has been a consistently good band before and since then.  Every DM album contains several quality tunes, with at least one real danceable if dark number along with the obligatory Martin Gore ballads.  In my opinion, \\"Playing the Angel\\" is one of the best of their post-Violator albums.<br /><br />I am really a fan of DM's uptempo music as opposed to the slower ballads, which can be a bit melodramatic for my tastes.  \\"Angel\\" has several really good tunes in this vein:<br /><br />1. \\"Lillian\\":  A unique, bouncy dance tune with a hook that's hard to forget.  Contains a basic synth riff that anyone can play on a garden-variety keyboard-but that's the beauty of Martin Gore's songwriting.  Dave Gahan does yeoman work.<br /><br />2. \\"Precious\\": Something about this song reminds of \\"Enjoy the Silence\\", but listening to it right after the older song reveals that they are very different.  Nice guitar riff, good synth programming and lilting vocal work by Gahan.<br /><br />3. \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\":  Another great tune, with excellent percussion and synth programming.  The one gripe I have is that the intro/chorus sound almost identical to \\"Dead of Night\\" from the previous \\"Exciter\\" album.  Typically dark lyrics relating to pain and suffering - a regular DM topic.<br /><br />4. \\"John the Revelator\\":  Another DM tune on the subject of religion and the contradictions contained thereof.  Hearing this song I couldn't help but think it is about George W. Bush.  Again excellent synth programming...Gahan almost barks out the lyrics.<br /><br />5. \\"Suffer Well\\":  Proof that Dave Gahan can indeed write decent music, this song is not quite up to Martin Gore's standard, but still quite listenable.  I should imagine Dave will write more songs on subsequent DM albums, and will get better at it as time goes by (of course Gahan had already written tunes for his solo album).<br /><br />Gore's ballads had pretty much the same impression on me as they did on Amazon's reviewer; I feel \\"Macrovision\\" and \\"Damaged People\\" are a bit overindulgent.  This is where the album loses a star - \\"Violator\\" had no schmaltz like these tunes, and that is why it is the album against which all other Depeche Mode music is measured.<br /><br />Overall \\"Playing the Angel\\" is a very good album, and I place it in the echelon just below the pinnacle of Depeche Mode creativity and danceability.er; I feel \\"Macrovision\\" and \\"Damaged People\\" are a bit overindulgent.

1577314808|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's wonderful masterpiece about living in the now was a true inspiration to me. I have this book along with his CD collections and highly recommend them. They have helped me understand about my ego and the pain body. His books have made me aware of the internal work necessary as I strive for inner peace. I saw him live at Agape Church outside of Los Angeles a couple of years ago. He is a true inspiration and an incredible teacher for all of us. I had a few of his videos. So if you can't see him live purchase one and get a feel for this man. His suffering (he was in deep depression for a long time and also homeless) and eventual enlightenment is a story unto itself. If you are open to Spiritual awareness I can also recommend a book that was just published. The title is \\"This School Called Planet Earth\\" by Summer Bacon.
0060899190|5.0|I just discovered POST SECRET last night and already it has begun to affect me.<br /><br />No one wants to drown in her sorrows or enjoy others' torments, but there is a wonderous, small lifting of loneliness when we discover that perfect strangers share our deceptively unique fears and hidden truths. POST SECRET stings you with the little messages scattered throughout its pages of anonymous postcards sent to Frank Warren, the man who put together this book.<br /><br />I'm obviously not referring to the postcard from a man stating he survived 9/11 and never told his family or friends. Nor am I thinking of the Starbucks employee who gives decaf coffee to the customers who tick him off.<br /><br />The postcards that resonate with many readers are the heart-breaking pleas, rants against the self or the endearingly honest confessions of childhood memories they cannot let go of easily.<br /><br />The simplest ones, accompanied with beautifully constructed drawings or collages, hit home the hardest. One POST SECRET contributor, for instance, sent in a picture of her dog, along with the words, \\"I'm afraid no one will ever love me as much as my dog does.\\"<br /><br />POST SECRET reminds us that sometimes we can see ourselves in strangers more than we can in our friends or families. It's a scary thought, but it's also a strangely comforting one.
068987474X|5.0|This book is brilliant because it contains much needed advice written from a man's perspective about dating.  Unfortunately, many of the recent relationship books are written by men who have been married for decades (no names mentioned) and aren't really in touch with today's dating dilemmas. Greg tells like it really is and can help women come out of their fog of relationship denial in a way that sometimes girlfriends cannot.  <br /> <br />Last night I saw the re-run of \\"Sex and the City\\" where the women discussed the concept of \\"he's not that into you\\" (my understanding is that Greg consulted for the show). It was hysterical and eye-opening because the girls kept giving excuses for why the men hadn't called, telling each other optimistically that really, truly, surely he must be interested ----when all of his actions indicated otherwise.  The episode highlighted that even smart women can be in deep denial about a man's interest in her (or lack of it) and this is exactly why \\"He's Not That Into You\\" is helpful for those who dare to read it.    <br /> <br />Although Greg's advice is sometimes harsh, in the long-run I believe that this book will remain popular because there are enough women who really want to make better love choices and this book is a good start. For the newly uncoupled, I also recommend his sequel (\\"It's Called a Break-Up Because It's Broken\\") because it focuses largely on boosting a woman's self-esteem and giving her practical tips for avoiding unhealthy partnerships. <br /> <br />I also recommend John Gray's \\"Mars and Venus on a Date\\" and Harriett Lerner's \\"The Dance of Intimacy\\" to understand the dynamics of coupleship better.  <br /> <br />Keep this book on your nightstand and read it for a reality-check when he hasn't called for almost a week and you are tempted to believe that he was really, really that busy.  You deserve better and you can have it!
B000AADYUI|5.0|Long before the Star Wars sound effects crew did it, Paul Kantner and Jerry Garcia threw the nearest vacuum cleaner into the mix to emulate the sounds of outer space! <br /> <br />I don't need to add to what's been written except to say that at the tender age of 13, having only recently succumbed to the very real psychedelic temptations that presented themselves in 1970, we really didn't know what to think of this \\"Hijack the Starship\\" motif! It didn't dawn on us that this was only Sci-Fi, and we honestly wondered if there really might be a bona fide conspiracy afloat. The other intriguing part (not to mention the sheer quality of the musicianship, here, particularly Gracie's piano) was the mention of my birthday (I was adopted in Marin County). <br /> <br />This album is truly the climax of the Utopian dream as it had been put to music over the four or five years preceding. <br /> <br />I will say that whatever other versions you get, a used copy of the full package original vinyl (with book AND sleeve) is a must. I saw a slightly partied copy for less than five bucks not too long ago. <br /> <br />Regarding \\"Let's Go Together,\\" I quite frankly prefer the original take (the so-called alternate lyrics version) over the one we all know and love. Yes, that's what I said, the original version is the \\"alternate\\" and the \\"official\\" version is literally a hack of that version. If you listen very (very) closely (with good headphones) to the vinyl version (the one that we all know and love), you will hear quite plainly the places where he overdubbed Gracie's vocals with his own, changing the lyrics as he went along. It's almost as if Kantner, working after hours, long after the rest of the crew had pronounced this one \\"done,\\" just couldn't leave it alone, that he just had to somehow rework it so that it would fit into his \\"Starship\\" motif. (Paul Kantner? lacking even the tiny amount of creativity it would have taken to let \\"South America\\" be symbolic of \\"Bright Andromeda\\"!?) <br /> <br />That's all I have to say, except to repeat that this is one of the all-around best albums I've ever heard -- despite its hopelessly poor sound quality. (The first CD was among the most pathetic commercial productions ever, second only to Velvet Underground Live at Max's Kansas City. The first Blows CD was produced from a commercial cassette tape! I'm *serious*! [I'm also an audio engineer by trade.] I cannot distinguish between the two in a blind test, and nobody that I've challenged over the years could either! Its loudest moment was still a full 18 dB below zero!) And no, I haven't heard this release, but have the one where the \\"alternate\\" \\"Let's Go Together\\" replaced the commonly known track.)
B0009X7664|5.0|Harper Lee's Pulitzer prize-winning ageless novel To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the finest pieces of literature, past or present, ever composed.  The movie of the same name, inspired and based solely on the book, is brilliant as well; this updated Special Edition DVD is presented in beautiful packaging and includes many bonus features, including an extra disc featuring a \\"Conversation with Gregory Peck,\\" the amazing actor behind Atticus Finch, the hero of the book and film.  The movie itself is truly amazing in every sense, and even the usage of black and white in mostly color pictures and TV make it even more superb.  Perfect book, perfect film adaption; one of the best films of all time.
0446608955|5.0|Seventeen-year-old Landon never thought that he would end up falling for Jamie Sillilvan, but when Landon asks her to homecoming, everything starts to change. <br /> Jamie it the Baptist preacher's daughter, and Landon is a rich kid who hangs out with the popular kids, so there was no way that these two would ever hook up; or was there?  A Walk to Remember is a fight for love and life.  Landon fights for Jamie's love after he got to know her, and Jamie fights for her life after finding out that she has a disease.  They find that together they can fight against Jamie's disease, and that Landon can learn to love some things that he never thought he would.   <br /> I really enjoyed this book.  What Landon overcomes in A Walk to Remember is amazing.  He learns mot to judge people by their looks, but to get to know them before he even thinks about judging them.  I think that we all could learn a lesson from Landon.  Then Jamie thinks about the people who she thinks are less unfortunate than her, when she is dying from a disease that could kill her.  We could all take something from this book and use it in our everyday lives.  That's why I liked this book so much, you not only just read it but they set an example up for everyone.  Not to judge before you know something about that person, and to fight for love and life. <br /> A Walk to Remember is definitely for girls.  I would recommend this book to any girl who likes romance stories.  Any other book by Nicholas Sparks I would also recommend because they are all romance stories that tug at your heart string.  I have read many other books by Nicolas Sparks and they are all just a wonderful as A Walk to Remember. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|this is for all the anti madonna here most epecially the one who wrote reality check review. I just want to say that please accept the fact that our queen of pop is still here and very successful for about 20 years. Confessions on a dancefloor is a fun and pop dance album of madonna. If you want meaty serious o Cds of Mads get Erotica, like a prayer, ray of light or even american life. COAD is not one of her greatest but it is great in its own way. According to this immature MC fan her M records are only selling on other countries except in America. Who cares if the CD is not a big hit in USA? does this means the taste of most americans are much better than the taste of other countries?  Excuse me but i think other countries have much more sophisticated and diverse taste in music. Most people in the USA prefers R&B and Rap. the list of songs in Billboard magazine now is so boring. I admire Madonna for being brave and different in choosing the music she wants to produce. Mariah on the other hand keeps releasing albums the same over and over again. SHes really trying very very hard to capture the young crowd nowadays. SHes very formulaic and always uses rappers in her songs. ughhh! Im tired of it already. And also look at her videos she looks like competing with the jessicas, britney, xtina, gwen etc....  Shes much better during the vision of love days. Well regarding the grammies look who has the clout? Even though Madonna is not nominated she still in command to be the opening number. And hello Mariah got only 3 Grammies unlike Madonna in 1998. the standing ovation??? Well people in the grammies are boring.... so what do you expect?
0399241515|5.0|<br /> <br /> The book Scorpia by Anthony Howitiz is one of the best in his series. It is about the continuing story of England's youngest spy Alex Rider. After his last mission where Yessen told Alex to find Scorpia and he will learn about his father moments before his death.  Alex is torn whether to find this Scorpia or to stay in England with M16. With an ending that will have you reading it over and over it is a book that you won't want to miss. <br /> <br /> I liked this book because Anthony put so much detail in the book. Alex was around the same age as me to So I felt I could relate. The book was filled with so much action that it was bulging out of the cover.   <br />
B0006M4SO6|5.0|The newest effort by Pat Metheny Group entitled, The Way Up, is by far one of their best.  The first CD that I ever purchased was a Pat Metheny Group CD, thus I have heard a lot of their stuff and this is some of the best.  allmusic.com says \\"it may actually be the record Metheny and Mays have been trying to make for over two decades,\\" and I think I might have to agree.  It is also one of allmusic's top 50 albums of 2005.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|Joe and boys were on that night in Germany.  The shots on this are fantastic from close-ups such as Joe singing Burning Hell to his impressive fret work.  The dvd captures the best of the group live with a lot of extended versions of the songs. There's some tasty slide work on The River and Burning Hell. Even though its 90 minutes long, you still want more.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|Going back through two decades of Madonna's music, her singles and hits have been so overpowering its easy to overlook the occasional clinker that has turned up on a CD.  (\\"Ray of Light\\" was probably her strongest and consistent work since \\"Like a Virgin.\\")  \\"Confessions\\" doesn't have some of the pretentious or goofball missteps that plagued \\"Music\\" or \\"American Life\\" (\\"Impressive Instant\\" \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" \\"Die Another Day\\" are some of the more egregious examples; its a pity that she didn't do one masterwork instead of two mixed bags).  On the other hand, it also doesn't have the highs of \\"Music\\" \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" \\"Hollywood\\" \\"Runaway Lover\\" or \\"X-Static Process.\\"  It's a smoothly mixed dance party with some great hooks and some appalling lyrics (\\"I like New York/Other places make me feel like a dork.\\"  PLEASE!).  The drawback to this continual groove is that the songs tend to blur and blend, and the lack of distinction eventually begins to handicap it.  (There's nothing here as stunning as \\"Gone\\" or \\"Mer Girl,\\" two previous album closers.)  It's good to know our Madge is still out there stirring up the sh_t and being provocative (though her attitude is slowly sliding over the line from brashly confident to confrontational and hostile), and she can still get bodies on the dance floor.  But if \\"Ray of Light\\" was the high-water mark for an artist at the peak of her powers, \\"Confessions\\" finds her mostly treading said waters.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|It's no accident that Sigur Ros' latest tour finds them playing symphony halls:More than any other band that could remotely be categorized within the \\"rock\\" idiom, these Icelandic innovators concoct soaring soundscapes whose dynamic structure is decidedly orchestral in its approach. Ostensibly using traditional instruments- guitar, bass, keys, drums- the quartet creates ethereal sounds that could be beamed in from another world, and \\"Takk\\" is their most melodically memorable masterpiece yet. <br /> <br />A singles band Sigur Ros is not- like early Pink Floyd or Radiohead at their most experimental, they prefer epic songs that flow seamlessly in an artfully crafted sequence, conceptual in construct if not in lyrical themes (although, with their tendency to veer from Icelandic to the made-up \\"Hopelandic\\" language, who can tell the difference?). The album gets off to a slow start, with the ambient opening title track feeding into the gorgeous \\"Glosoli,\\" which marches along to to a subtle pulse as reverberating guitars howl and wail, Bjork-like music boxes tinkle and twitter, and Jn (Jnsi) Birgisson's soaring falsetto ascends like an angel from another planet. From there, the album gradually gains in dynamic momentum, never settling into the typical quiet/loud formula that occasionally plagued some of their previous work.  <br /> <br />The CD's centerpiece, \\"Saeglopur,\\" is a mesmerizing 7-minute wonder that rides atop a hypnotic piano groove, gradually adding on layer upon layer of heavenly sounds that simply beg to be listened to at high volume in order to catch their every intricacy, before eventually erupting in an ecstatic explosion of distorted guitars and throbbing drums that remind you that music, at its best, can be nearly as orgasmic as great sex. It's the best song on the best album by one of the world's best bands. And that, my friends, is a statement I don't make lightly.  <br /> <br />This music will change your life.
0060589280|5.0|\\"Once upon a time\\" this is how the story starts , where Paulo chose Maria to guide us thro the journey of exploring life. he translated all her emotions, desires, her girly teen ideas and feelings into words. How she fancied her neighbor, what she thought about love at this young age, moving at a deeper level, her exploration of what was a desire, and the exploration of her body.  the story moves as Maria met a man who changed her life, who took her to Switzerland where she became a prositute.   Where all her emotions are burried, seeing all the men being the same, meanwhile she explored everything about sex, the pain, the pleasure, the guilt, the love, exposing us to her own philosophy of what life is all about.  Till she met Ralf the artist who changed her life, whom she loved in a very different beautiful way, both were exploring love together.   Her daily diaries were just amazing, very transparant, broad, but just leaves you thinking and wondering what exactly might life be all about.  It is a book that every person has to read,because simply it can't be any better...
0689865384|5.0|I think this book was awesome. I really liked the way the author could describe the future in a way that made it sound like the past, and also think of so many things that could actually happen in, say, four-hundred years. I really liked this book: complete with drama, suspense, romance, thrills, and friendship. I loved how everything just flowed and I never wanted to put this book down. I absolutely can't wait to read the second one.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|(Actually 4.5 stars but I rounded up) <br /> <br />I absolutely loved the movie! I thought it was accurate to Austen's book especially given that the movie was just about 2 hours. You cannot obviously put in everything in the book in the movie unless it's a mini-series like the Firth piece. The movie didn't stray too far from the book like a lot of books-turned-into-movies do. <br /> <br />Even though it was a bit dirty scenic wise, it was just the take of this particular director. I didn't let it impare my enjoyment of the film.  <br /> <br />My only slight flaw with it was initially the beginning moved quickly and for some friends and family who hadn't read the book, it took them a little while to catch on to everything. There were also a few artsy type scenes that confused me (Lizzie staring into the mirror forever, her standing on a the edge of a cliff) but again nothing to impare my enjoyment.  <br /> <br />I fully plan on buying this one!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Frances the Mute shouldn't, under any circumstances, be catagorized along with the majority of other alblums.  There is a definitive distinction...Art.  When making this alblum the former At-The-Drive-In members, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala, wanted to express themselves, their emotions, there \\"trance\\" through this band.  They were tired of the creative confines and the dullness of ATDI. They often state they don't wish to entertain and sell records, they only wish to explore eartisitc expression through music. This is essentially important to truly appeciate the alblum.  It is an amazing collusion of many genres' of music.  Just like visual art, you either get it or you don't.  If you get it, it's flawless.  Every sound effect, every chaotic extension is there for a reason.  Its doubtless that they had intended purpose for it all. They prove to be musical genius's by any standard, but in particular...innovation.  Omar's guitar is unlike anything else today.  I wouldn't compare to anything in the pass because there is so much modernization that it overwhelms any underlying influence of the past.  <br /> <br />The synopsis: Don't base your desicion off reviews, or the sound clips, the alblum is incrdibly moody and interconnected and is intended to flow throughout the song.  I would say buy the alblum, even if you don't like it...you will see either the rise of an historic band or the failure of experimintation gone too far. <br /> <br />*Frances the Mute was the only alblum done by the Mars Volta Sober.  To truly represent themselves and not the drugs influencing them.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Serenity is the film sequel to the single season of the television series Firefly.  While knowledge of Firefly is not required, it's not a bad idea, as you gain a deeper appreciation for the characters.  It is a unique vision of the future, and just enough grounded dialogue to keep the audience watching. <br /> <br />This is, however, the final part of the saga.  The story hints that there is a little hope for future tales, but (SPOILERS) several crew members are dead. (END SPOILERS)  That shouldn't get your hopes up, though.  On the business end, it was amazing that Serenity was even made, much less a sequel after its lackluster theatrical showing.  Do not despair too much, though.  It's a good ending, and a lot of closure is there. <br /> <br />Overall, I think you'll like the film, and you'll probably enjoy the TV show.  But let's not go nuts.  The signal has stopped after this.
0307236722|5.0|I have a ton of baking books already, as baking is one of my hobbies. This book really stands out because it is so skillfully organized, and teaches even the experienced baker a few tips. Everything I have made so far has been absolutely delicious, and has turned out perfectly. It's not one of those books that has recipes only experienced chefs can complete successfully. <br /> <br />What's also special is how unbelievably gorgeous the photography is. It really makes you want to throw on an apron and start mixing.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Frank Miller does not like women.  I'm firmly convinced of this, as every woman here (and most if not all in his comic book epic this is based on) is either a stipper, prostitute, or college professor. <br /> <br />And the college professor died before the movie starts. <br /> <br />Despite this, there are no real weak female roles.  While they all have less than respectable professions, they are all strong, unique characters, and I think that pretty much lets Frank off the hook. <br /> <br />In a more general sense, this movie is about a film noir kind of town.  Guns are everywhere, blood and death abound.  Howeveer, the visual style of it all is so compelling that it looks remarkably similar to the comic opus.  Strong uses of black and white keep everything graphic, but not gory. <br /> <br />The movie is actually about 3 character's tales, that intertwine on a very superficial level.  You can tell they all inhabit the same city, but rarely get in each other's way.  That said, this film is a work of art, in that it is visually compelling and wonderfully written.  It is gritty and violent, but there is a beauty to it all.
1400032717|4.0|Having worked with children with autism/Asperger's for years, I found Curious Incident curious indeed. Written from the point of view of a teenager, the narrative provides wonderful insight into the cognitive processes of a person with this type of disability. As well as being a compelling detective story, Incident brings home the idea that there are different versions of reality, depending upon who's doing the experiencing. It beautifully illustrated the mutual misunderstanding and frustration that occur whenever \\"ordinary\\" people and \\"special\\" people interact. Curious Incident is both entertaining and eye-opening, characterisics that aren't often encountered within a single novel.
0385512058|5.0|The title of this book is what captured my attention. The passion with which it was written captured my enthusiasm. The author, Keith Ferrazzi, is a marketing expert and networking fanatic. If you only do half of the things that he does in this book, you will dramatically increase your networking skills. The underlying message, and a repetitive theme of this book, is that networking is not about getting; it's about giving - giving people what they need to succeed. In doing so, he believes that you build solid relationships that will be both beneficial and rewarding. He doesn't just give advice, he gives you detailed instruction while  offering real-life examples of how he befriended prominent, well-respected and accomplished business leaders in the process. Many of these relationships were instigated, enhanced, or solidified over a meal - during which time he could fervently express his hunger to help another succeed; thus the creation of the title. It's a great concept, a winning formula and the best book I've ever read on networking. Buy it today!
B000BRBA8S|5.0|Like almost all of Wong Kar Wai's films, this one is intensely beautiful to look at with a stunning soundtrack to match, and has a wonderfully lyrical style.<br /><br />It's one of very few films that made me want to watch it again as soon as I finished watching it...there is so much richness and depth, almost every frame and scene invites repeated re-viewings.  There were a number of elements of the story and characters that I didn't immediately \\"get\\" the first time, which was nice.  Much better than your typical dumbed-down, over-simplified Hollywood dreck that is easily predicable within the first 10 minutes.<br /><br />The special features are also substantiative, with the deleted scenes being quite good and fully produced rather than some raw unfinished footage.  The interviews with Wong Kar Wai, (the absolutely exquisite) Zhang Ziyi, and Tony Leung are also very interesting.
B0007GAERG|4.0|It just amazes me that persons who claim to love or hate Mariah spend so much time getting worked up and writing these juvenile reviews. If you like - enjoy. If you don't - don't listen. Don't try to force your views down anyone's throat. As Mary J Blige says \\"You could hate it or love it\\". <br /> <br />Admittedly I am a fan and see no need to attack all other female singers under the sun or spread the gospel of Mariah like its a new religion.  <br /> <br />And to the haters - your rantings does  not change the fact that she has sold 160 million records and has a strong network of fans. So when you find yourself obsessing about how much \\"CRAP\\" she happens to be, simply go pop one of YOUR favorite CDs into your boom box and cool your nerves. And if dat doesn't work - get a hobby - really now.
B000084T18|1.0|Flat out plain and simple 50 cent sucks. G-Unit sucks. The game sucks. Almost any rapper you see on mtv sucks they are all the same garbage rappin about the same garbage about how gangster they are. Who cares i bet there are a lot more people who are a lot more gangster than any of these idiots on tv.  They all just talk about how they get on all the hoes. Why don't you guys learn some respect women are people too they're not just used for sex and then throne out just like the condom they probably should have used cuz who knows what diseases they got from those dirty guys cuz you know they've done some dirty sluts in their days. Then they'll talk about all the drugs they do. Who cares drugs are played out they're just a waste of time and money and your life. Then they'll talk about all the people they've shot. I got an idea just sell your confession of murder to the whole world that's a brilliant idea why don't you just tell them who you shot and go to jail like the rest of em to become your overly huge cell mate named bubba's sex interest. Get real. If you like this cd you have no taste in music. This is not hip-hop, this is senseless rap. Whoever thinks this is hip-hop should listen to non phixion they're white and they're more gangster than any of these mtv fags. Plain and simple real hip-hop <br />
B00005JKGO|4.0|I first saw this movie in the sixties, when its expose of Rome's decadent jet set still had some shock value.  Four decades later, when the mating habits of movie stars are endlessly dissected across the globe, the trials and tribulations of the sweet life feel numbingly familiar.<br /><br />What's left is the story of Marcello, (Marcello Mastroianni) a gossip columnist, and what happens to him during a series of loosely structured night wanderings.  Trailing Marcello through Rome, we learn his character and discern his fate.  He aspired once to be an intellectual, and idealizes his friend Steiner, imagining that Steiner's life is the perfect blend of serious purpose and family warmth.  What happens to Steiner provides the movie's only true emotional shock. Marcello's traveling salesman father shows up unexpectedly in Rome.  Marcello wants him to stay longer so they can get to know each other better.  But, after a raucous evening on the town, the old man bolts once again.  We see the source of Marcello emotional guardedness.<br /><br />This guardedness affects his romantic relationships.  There's Emma, his steady girlfriend, who wants a commitment that he's unwilling to provide.  He dallies instead with movie stars, such as Sylvia (Anita Ekberg, whose zaftig charms show us how much standards of cinematic beauty have changed over forty years.)  His most interesting relationship is with Maddelena (Anouk Aimee) a decadent aristocrat.  There's definitely chemistry between them, but neither of them can put aside their party masks long enough to explore it.  His most moving encounter is with a young girl from the country, a waitress at a seaside resort.  The jaded Marcello is drawn to her innocence and optimism, because it takes him back to his younger self, a fresh arrival to the big city.  At the movie's end, after a debauched night, he sees this girl on the beach at dawn, standing on the other side of a channel.  She shouts to him, and gestures, but the wind snatches away her words.  He can't connect to her.  Shrugging, he turns back to his bleary-eyed troupe of nightlifers.<br /><br />This is a rich movie, and its energetic inventions keep you hooked, even though it's almost three hours long.  As you would expect from one of the cinema's world masters, there's a lot of artful filmmaking here - innovative night photography, a playful musical score by the brilliant Nino Rota, arresting visuals, such as the opening shot of a statue of Jesus being airlifted by helicopter over the city.  Many of Fellini's major preoccupations are on display as well.  His nostalgia for the simple, natural life of the country is played out in Marcello's interactions with the young waitress.  The carnival that is Italian Catholicism is brought hilariously to life when two young children claim to have visions of the Virgin Mary as a way of jerking the chains of their elders.  The adults, desperate for a miracle, swarm to the site.  Marcello and the paparazzi could care less, as long as there's enough spectacle to squeeze out a story or visual.  And the pretensions of urban intellectuals are wittily skewered during a party scene at Steiner's where bombastic people talk past each other in several languages.<br /><br />Some of the most appealing aspects of Fellini's movies aren't all that evident in La Dolce Vita.  His warmth towards his characters, for instance.  The starlets, aristocrats and tabloid journalists that Marcello runs with aren't very likable.  Without his easy charm, this would be a cold movie indeed.  Also, Fellini is the best there is at using cinematic imagery to create a dreamlike flow to his stories.  But this movie is full of abrupt, even awkward transitions, as though Fellini, following Marcello through the warren of Rome's streets, keeps hitting dead ends which force him to back up in order to go forward.<br /><br />Although Fellini's starting to move away from his neorealistic roots in La Dolce Vita, he doesn't move very far.  When he finally returned to those roots, he made Amarcord, an amazing fusion of realism and surrealism.  For me, it's Fellini's best movie, and perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made.  La Dolce Vita isn't as good as Amarcord, and much of its shock value has been diluted by time, but it's worth seeing for Mastroianni's seemingly effortless virtuosity and for the privilege of watching a great director capture the passing parade.ade Amarcord, an amazing fusion of realism and surrealism.

1594200653|4.0|Judt's book \\"Postwar\\" is a massive product of a massive undertaking, which is to tell the story of Europe's history since World War II. He pays attention to all the relevant aspects of European history, taking care to balance between Western and Eastern Europe in his narration. The most original aspect of this book is the way Tony Judt gives predominance rather to the socio-economic history of the continent instead of the political history, elevating his analysis above the level of high school \\"Kings and battles\\" overviews. The European project of unification as well as the perceived downfall of ideological politics is also put into the spotlight.<br /><br />The downside of this is that the political views of the author (solidly British conservative) serve as a lens through which he views the social and economic developments of Europe, rather than putting the political side \\"in the open\\", so to speak, as most popular historians do. This does however allow him to describe the history of the communist states in Eastern Europe with a suitably detached air, certainly an improvement over the denunciatory tone many American historians of Eastern Europe use.<br /><br />The overall balance of subjects within the book is very well done, and one never leaves a chapter feeling that there was more to be told about the period. Nevertheless the focus on Europe is itself quite narrow, and hardly anything is said about the influence of the United States or Japan on Europe (except some platitudes about American cinema and the like), or for example the effects the decolonization had on European colonizing states' perception of their own history. This hole in Judt's historiographical approach will not hinder anyone who is just looking for a general overview of European post-war history, but does prevent it from becoming more than a popular historical work. Too bad, since Judt obviously has a keen eye for the kaleidoscope of social relations.<br /><br />Mostly recommended for non-European readers who want a thorough overview of what's happened on the continent since 1945.n-European readers who want a thorough overview of what's happened on the continent since 1945.
B000002IZ4|5.0|The 1990's produced some of the best rock music since rock and roll's inception with a few groups creating some deep and flawless masterpieces. Especially those groups whose sophmore alblums pefected the aura and art tried on their blockbuster debut alblums. STP being one of such for the mid-90's with \\"Purple\\" and it's singles. This alblum is ridiculously perfect in all for what it is. It fully represented the 90's era of gloom and honesty. Unfortunately it also fortified the sad truth in the art of a rockstar. This alblum is one of the best examples of a prelude to destruction. Scott Weiland's poetic magic only explained through massive amounts of drugs and booze. With his memoirs coming out soon, to buy this particular alblum will give you a bigger scope of why that man should have died after making it. If not, buy it only for the track \\"Big Empty\\" and nothing else. It captures the entire idea behind grunge/alternative rock before the previous died and the latter turned into mainstream pop garbage. Buy it for the truth. Conversations do kill.
B000BTDMDC|5.0|>  The most exciting British group since the Beatles!.....'nuff said!   Reminiscent of the Clash without the politics.  Nice working class,   kitchen sink lyrics.  'Dancefloor' has the best hook in years, wish I   could figure out what it was.  It torments the mind, and   sets the feet racing.      Get with it, dig the Arctics!  The Arctic Monkeys have   rejuvenated rock'n'roll and warmed the cockles of an old   fart's heart, for that I thank them.  In 1980 the Rolling   Stones said 'rock'n'roll is dead'. The Arctics have proved   them wrong.      Rock has always thrived on competition.  In the 'sixties it   was the Beatles up against the Beach Boys.  I suggest this   time it's The Arctics against the brilliant American   group: Why?

B000063DHL|5.0|What I really love about Iron Maiden is not the fact that they are excellent musicans, is the fact that they have stayed true to their genere through 20+yrs of music. Even the newer albums pretty much sound the same, and even though hey have had 3 different lead singers, they still have managed to keep it all together. \\"Somewhere in Time\\" just happens to be my favorite album from the band, yet all the albums are pretty good, even the newer material. LONG LIVE MAIDEN and if we had more bands that tried to stick to the roots with less experimentation, the music world will be a better place
B000BBOUU4|5.0|I was almost dreading the day I would have to see this film -- I did so only because someone purchased the DVD for me as a present.  I sat down, fully expecting to loathe this new venture, especially considering my love for the original film.  I was pleasantly surprised, however.   <br />I like Tim Burton films, so I was immediately tickled by the offbeat humor (I am one of the few people who actually enjoyed \\"Mars Attacks\\").  Danny Elfman's music score is catchy and the songs inventively delightful (each song for each kid is from a different era of popular music -- though you may want to flip on the subtitles so you can understand the lyrics).  Johnny Depp's Wonka is weird but not repulsive, and the flashbacks to his childhood (with a dentist father chillingly essayed by Christopher Lee)give us a solid understanding of his excentricities.   <br />Perhaps more amazing is the focus on Charlie Bucket, a delightfully normal kid if there ever was one, as the stablizing force for the story.  Not only is Charlie's family more accessible and real than the 1970's version, but it manages to conclude the film with a surprising yet satisfying pro-family statement.  Those disappointed by the closing line of the original film (\\"But you know what happened to the boy who suddenly got everything he wanted...he lived happily ever after.\\") because it seemed to contradict every oompa loompa song that preceded it, will be pleased with the sober ending of this film which is strongly reminiscent of Dahl's own \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" and even Dr. Seuss' \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\\"   <br />While trying hard not to give things away, it can be said that the Wonka weirdness becomes perfectly acceptable, because Wonka is a character in the process of becoming better, and it is Charlie who manages to be the catalyst for change.   <br />While the weirdness is weird enough so that I would not immediately call this a \\"family\\" film, it is still an impressive piece of work that is worth alook.  One of Tim Burton's best films.
B000006NPY|2.0|Little did I even know this album existed until last week, when I was checking my review for another Pumpkins album, and I thought, 1998? They put another album out..I could have sworn that .............Infinate Sadness was the last album. Anyway, I did purchase this in hopes of it growing on me (I checked out a few samples and thought, not to good, but it might grow on me)So far, I am not impressed, and it seems this album might be the reason that the band was starting to have inner personal problems. There is such a big difference on this album from the Classic ................Infinate Sadness, that I really dont understand why they decided to make such a different type of album from what they were doing. Each Pumpkins album was getting better and better, and then the scored a \\"10\\" with ....Infinate Sadness, yet this album just seems like a bad REM album. It drags, and drags, and never seems to pick up, and some of the songs are really horrid. I dont know if this was due to creative differences, but I really dont like it one bit. Alot of fans seem to like this one, maybe if you are DIE-hard pumpkins fan, u might like this, yet I think .............Infinate Sadness is their best effort, and really dont listen to their other albums. I am very dissapointed with this.

B000002LQR|5.0|I don't think that you have to be a \\"Red Hot Chilli Peppers\\" fan to appricate this album. Alot of people argue that they love the older material, even older then this, and why I can agree that the newer material is weak, this one is the best of the bunch. First off, the Red Hot's pull off some amazing musical ablity, thanks in part to a very rigourous recording session that was overlooked by Rick Ruben. This album really is top-notch, and its a great rock and roll album that should be appricated by fans of all generes of music. From the poppy \\"Breaking the Girl\\" to the downright rocking title track this CD has a bit of everything on it. I really am disspointed with the follow ups, even though the follow up to this wasn't as good because it seemed that Dave just didn't fit into the band, and the more recent material is really kinda whinny pop-rock crapola. I can't stress enough how important this is to have in your collection, forget about that it is the Red Hots (if you dont like them) and just listen to some great musical abilities.ENJOY
B000001Y42|1.0|People have been telling me that Three Doller Bill Ya'll was Bizkits best album. And after hearing albums like Chocolate Starfish and Significant Other it's hard to believe that Bizkit has a good album at all. But me being a fair man I decided to give it a try(no I didn't buy it, my friend had a copy). After hearing it it still dosen't change my mind about Bizkit. If anything that was good about this album it's Wes guitar playing once again. Faith has to be one of their worst songs of all time. Sorry for not having the same opinion like other people about this album. In a way this album was a sign for all trash like this to come.For some they might enjoy it. I do have to admit that it is somewhat their heaviest but no not their best. It's not that I'm against Nu Metal,or rap metal like some people, I just don't see what talent Fred Durst has. If I have to recommend any nu metal band that had a better debut album  it have to be Rage Against The Machine, Korn, Deftones, Tool, and System Of A Down. And hey for someone to sell this album for a penny in the used section, now that already tells you something's wrong with this or any Bizkit album.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|When movies are described as a \\"roller coaster ride\\", or just a \\"non-stop thrill ride\\", I already suspect that this is just another movie that will give me a headache.<br /><br />When is Hollywood going to figure it out that making movies with too many special effects, and very little comprehensive drama, ends up being a very disatisfying experience for the viewer?!  Many unnecessary special effects were thrown in just so someone who enjoys creating special effects can \\"show off\\" his particular animation talent.<br /><br />When compared to an actual roller coaster, yes, the results can seem to be the same.  Usually a \\"thrilling roller coaster ride\\" is only about an honest minute and a half.  You don't want to be on a roller coaster for two hours.  That's what this overkill \\"roller coaster ride\\" of a movie does to people like me.  If you're like me, you'll definitely be bored to tears before the \\"ride\\" is over.<br /><br />If this movie was written word-for-word as a book, the contents of the story would be very bleak.  Van Helsing, written here, is a pretty bland story.  A loud, \\"in your face\\" display of absolutely nothing interesting!  The movie \\"Twister\\" was the same way.  All visual, but no real story.<br /><br />\\"Your reputation precedes you...\\"  Nobody in real life talks like that, but Hollywood seems to think that's a cool line.  I hear it in movies alot.  In fact, this film has alot of cliches' of films of the past which continues to prove it's lack of originality.<br /><br />And, what's more, they couldn't have picked a more boring, uninteresting actor to play \\"Dracula\\".  What is he, a \\"she-male\\" or something?  Realistically, Dracula should have been more handsome and charismatic, the way Bram Stoker (the writer and creator of the original \\"Dracula\\" written in 1897) perceived him to be.  This Richard Roxburgh as Dracula definitely contributed more to the non-appeal of this film.<br /><br />Come on, honestly, is this the limit of comprehensive imagination?  Does \\"character development\\" make you feel like you're having to learn more about a character that you really want to?  The absence of \\"character development\\" makes it so that you don't care what happens to anyone in the film.  \\"Kill him off!\\", \\"Kill her off, too!\\"  Who cares?  We didn't get a chance to know the character anyway.<br /><br />I was really hoping to enjoy this film because I love \\"gothic artwork\\".  The still scenes in this film really were very beautiful.  But, it wasn't enough to save this \\"lame\\" film.ike you're having to learn more about a character that you really want to?

0920668364|1.0|It is a mother's job to let her son go when he is a grown man, not to climb up to his window to rock him in his sleep.  That is sick and creepy.  This woman would be every wife's nightmare, the mother-in-law rival, the one who won't let her son grow up or let him go, the mother turned stalker.  This is not something a mother should be writing about her son, its her job to raise her children right and let them go. <br /> <br />

B00005JOFO|5.0|The Wives! The Wives...... the poor wives...  <br /> <br />This seems to be the cry of many who wanted to dislike Brokeback Mountain. It's one thing to be gay, but it's another to cheat on your wives..... an assertion that entirely misses the point the movie is trying to make.  <br /> <br />I'm actually aware of a leader of some Catholic group stating on radio, that she would think respectable gay men wouldn't like this movie because of the infidelity these gay men engaged in.  <br /> <br />Most of these people don't believe the word homophobia describes a legitimate social force. Or one that they would care about. For if it is a legitimate social force, they see it as something that only affects gay men. A term created by political activists for the \\"gay agenda.\\"  <br /> <br />And countering that idea is the message of the movie... Homophobia affects far more than gay men.  <br /> <br />If Ennis (and so many more) hadn't been raised in such a hostile environment, he could have accepted himself for who he was. He and Jack could have been honest about themselves, and lived safely together their entire lives.  <br /> <br />Because of homophobia, they couldn't. Many can't today. The familial and societal pressures for men to marry and have children are great. It is expected. So many gay men have been advised by their religious leaders to solve their homosexuality by marrying a woman. I myself was advised that by a Mormon church leader in the early 80s. He said to me, \\"Sex with a woman is so wonderful, that once you've experienced it, you'll never think of another man again.\\" Fortunately, I knew deep down that would never be true. I asked him, \\"But what woman would be willing to take a chance on me as some kind of experiment.\\" And I swear to God, he said, \\"Why tell her? It's a sure thing sex with her will change you, so why jeopardize it by telling her?\\"  <br /> <br />Well I never did marry (thankfully). I did join the Air Force, and won nearly every award open to me. That didn't work either. I left the Air Force to go through the Mormon Church's program to change me. A total, laughing joke. The idea was that by learning to play masculine sports like basketball and baseball with carefully selected straight men, we would now capture the male bondings we lacked in adolescence and \\"grow\\" out of homosexuality. I knew right then it was a farce because I'd always played masculine sports - football (quarterback), baseball (shortstop), and track, etc. I bonded fine.  <br /> <br />Of course, not one person was changed... and after a few months, most quite attending these useless meetings, and silly sports events. As time passed, it wasn't uncommon to run into other `graduates' down at one of the gay bars.  <br /> <br />In that church group, there were numerous married gay men who were now in the stages of divorce, and who were losing contact with their children. Wives forbidding them to see their kids. Many of these men were suicidal. It was pitiful. And the entire legal system of the Mormon state of Utah was against them. They had absolutely no chance to have their rights recognized or considered.  <br /> <br />It turns out, at that time, there were two large support groups for Mormon women who found themselves married to gay men. Several chapters were written about it, or were authored by members of it, in the groundbreaking book, \\"Peculiar People: Mormons and Same Sex Orientation.\\" These people described their experiences, and the education they received about putting your faith in the church leaders as opposed to facing reality.  <br /> <br />Before Peculiar People was published, a famous Mormon poet, Carol Lynn Pearson, wrote a book \\"Goodbye, I Love You,\\" about taking care of her gay husband as he died. Another woman whose life was changed because homophobia kept her husband from being able to be what he was. And so he tried to be what his church wanted, and married her..... but could not deny his nature.... and she so lovingly took him back when he was ill, and cared for him until his death.  <br /> <br />In the early 90's, before I left the `land of Zion,' a newspaper article appeared in the Salt Lake Tribune, about the alarming number of faithful Mormon women who were turning up HIV positive. Turns out their husbands were stopping off in public restrooms on their way home for a quickie with men, or steam rooms at gyms, or gay bars... or wherever. And then the virus was passed to them. But what if those men had never been pressured to marry women? What if they had the institution of marriage to anchor them into a monogamous union with one other man? It's a damn good chance neither these men or their wives would have been infected. <br /> <br />Any of these people know that the culprit in all this isn't homosexuality - which is a part of nature and always has been. Nor is it the expression of homosexual sex, as sex is a gift from God to all of us. It wasn't the gay men who didn't know better, and so they put their faith in their ignorant religious leaders, believing that marriage would change them. It was simply that ignorance coupled with fear that was at fault. And ignorance coupled with fear is the very basis of homophobia.  <br /> <br />Homophobia made victims, not only of the men, but of their wives and children. Homophobia assured those homes would be broken before the marriage vows were ever taken.  <br /> <br />Alma and Lureen were as much the victims of homophobia as Jack and Ennis. Only Jack and Ennis had their personal safety to worry about, unlike the wives. And Ennis had such internalized homophobia he couldn't even face himself.  <br /> <br />In this day, when we have politicians from the president on down, going around crying out that they have to `save' marriage by denying homosexuals equal opportunity in marriage, they are using this same homophobia for political gain. Have you ever heard George Bush explain just how his and Laura's marriage would be affected if a Jack and Ennis were given the legal rights marriage offers? Of course you haven't. And you never will because there is no threat to the institution of marriage just by extending it's benefits to gay and lesbian citizens (who also pay taxes by the way, and who were also born under a constitution that guarantees them the right to the pursuit of happiness, which would include having a family).  <br /> <br />Imagine Jack and Ennis living in Canada today, instead of Wyoming during the 60s. They could get married. They would have legal protections. There would be no wives being cheated on. All of them could have a happy life. What is so wrong with that?  <br /> <br />That is the message of this movie. Homophobia destroys. Being allowed to be what you are, openly, and with same rights as others brings on a life of happiness.  <br /> <br />So for those of you who are so concerned about the wives, and feel to criticize the movie because these guys cheated on their wives because they couldn't deny their nature.... understand what is truly responsible. Then lend your support for the Jack's and Ennis' and Alma's of the world. Support gay marriage.... Let's create a reality where people can be what nature made them to be...  <br />  <br />And for the reviewer who wrote the last two negative reviews (obviously the same individual), there was no \\"rape\\" in the tent scene.  Do you know what rape is?  It is forcing someone to have sex against their will.  Jack initiated the encounter.  It was not against his will.  <br /> <br />And to reviewer J.E Barnes, thanks for all the insights about the symbolisms.  I caught some of them, but you pointed out others that really make the film even more interesting.

0345457684|4.0|Altered Carbon by Richard Morgan, despite it's flaws is a smoker of a Sci-Fi Noir novel.  I gave it 4 stars.  No need for me to rehash the plot.  Just checkout the earlier reviews written by the better writers at Amazon!  The novel introduces an intriguing new paradigm in Sci-Fi that elaborates on the concept of the elimination of death (at least for those who can afford it).  The setting is five hundred years in the future. Society is able to transport the human cortical stack (i.e., the mind and soul) where humans can be \\"re-sleeved\\" into a new body. Either cloned, synthetic or someone else's body whose been put on ice.  Pretty neat huh?.  As the story progressed the plot got a little uneven and I found my self having to go back numerous times to get names and facts straight.  Actually the rating should be 3.5 stars because (this is a pet peeve of mine), there was no glossary of terms or a cast of characters.  Better novels that build new worlds and introduce new concepts have maps, glossaries and such.  That being said, one of my favorite characters was the Artificial Intelligence of the Hendrix Hotel (a great idea!).  However, characters like Reileen Kawahara and others are one dimensional, and are introduced off-handedly where their backgrounds are sketchy at best.  You have a hard time trying to relate to them.  Additionally, these characters appear as caricatures rather than living, breathing players in the novel.  Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems that the author spent a lot of time describing the technology and the setting and sacrificed character build up.  On the plus side, the action was first rate.  Without giving the story away, the hero Takeshi Kovacs was cool with all his Envoy skills. Alas, the ending got muddled yet somehow redeemed itself with a classic \\"Noir\\" style finish where we are none the wiser.  Despite this novel's shortcomings, this is a book still very much worth reading. Hey, where is my new sleeve?<br /><br />Enjoy~!
B000002UAF|5.0|This album is just superb. 13 super songs. It was recorded in 1964 and back then the Beatles were at the top , having already topped the charts around the world with their first couple of albums and a string of singles. Everyone was wondering what was next and if they could keep up the success and the musical greatness, or if they would quickly come crashing down.     They provided the answer with this album and also, their debut movie, also called \\"A Hard Days Night\\", both of which were global successes.    The title cut, \\"Hard Days Night\\", was written and sung by Paul McCarntey & John Lennon, but was inspired by Ringo, who used the phrase to decribe how long the band had been wrking in the studio at the end of a recording session. Released as a single it became yet another  #1 hit for the band. The singles b-side, \\"Things we said today\\" (also included on the album) is even better than the hit side that could have been a chart-topper in its own right.        \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", another #1 hit, is also here, as are popular album cuts such as the Lennon lead \\"I Should Have Known Better\\", McCartney's \\"And I Love Her\\" and another of my favorites, \\"You Can't Do That\\".    \\"I'll Be Back\\", a somber toned love song, is a great ending to the album.     The Beatles first three albums (\\"Please Please Me\\", \\"With The Beatles\\" & \\"A Hard Days Night\\") are all great, most bands wouldn't be able to pull of as many good songs in a 10-30 year career, but, as for the beatles, as great as these songs were, there were still even better to come.    I highly recommend this album.
B00005JOFO|5.0|The review by J. E. Barnes basically says all that I could hope to say about this movie and book.  I bought the book and the screenplay and cannot keep from reading both over and over and will buy the DVD the minute it comes out.  This movie has gotten under my skin and I find myself walking around grieving for these two men and their lost love and suffering.  I believe Heath Ledger did a magnificent job, but I think Jake Gyllenhal (sp?) did just as fine a job as Jack,  a personality so different from Ennis. I could feel their love and desperation and when they first see each other again after four years, I thought I would almost faint from the emotional upheaval of it all.  I think of Jack's comment, \\"Sometimes I miss you so bad I can hardly stand it.\\" and I could feel what he was saying when he said it.  Anyone who has ever deeply loved, whether it be a lover or a child,  and been separated from that deep love for any period of time knows what kind of true heart pain you feel.  And this movie is about deep deep love which cannot be fully expressed at the time.  It doesn't matter who they are, except that these characters are so fully drawn and presented that you know them --- it's the fact that their love is so present on the screen that you feel it piercing your heart.  I'm not even sure why I am so drawn to this book and movie (I am a hetero female - married with children, etc.), except that it is so much about deep love and it is rare to see anything these days except for those flighty little \\"chick flicks\\" that are cute but meaningless.  This is anything but meaningless.  When my husband and I walked into the movie, a woman walking out said, \\"Good Luck.  I hope you have a lot of kleenex.\\"  But I was numb when I walked out.  I was just completely overcome, even though I had read the book first and knew what it was and what was coming.  I had fallen in love with Ennis and Jack and just wanted to take care of them and ease their pain.  (Of course it didn't hurt that they are both gorgeous...) Just go with an open mind and an open heart and let it reach you.
B000002UB6|5.0|This is the final album issued before the Beatles disbanded in 1970. Being the true great legendry band they were, they went out on a top note. This album is a great document.  <br /> <br />My favorite songs here include \\"Two Of Us\\", \\"The One After 909\\" and \\"Let It Be\\". <br /> <br />\\"Two Of Us\\" is a duo sung by Paul and John and it is often falsely claimed Paul wrote this about his friendship with John, he didn't. It was written about Paul and his wife, Linda. <br />It's a nice country song about going for a drive, but can also imply a relationship with a very close friend, hence the assumption he wrote it about him and Lennon (\\"You and I have memories, longer than the road that stretches out ahead\\"). <br /> <br />\\"I Me Mine\\" is a George Harrison song, about greed and selfishness, although it is such a fun rocker, you won't be listening to the words most the time, just singing along with them, but still, it's a great Beatles number. <br /> <br />\\"Let It Be\\" is Paul at his best. This piano written ballad (in the vein of \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Yesterday\\") is regarded as one of the Beatles finest moments. It was written about Paul's dream of meeting once again with his late Mother (Mary) and has no religious meaning as some might think. The guitar solo here, played by Harrison, is much better than the one that ended up on the single (played by Lennon). <br /> <br />\\"I Dig A Pony\\", sung by John and Paul, is a rocker than would have fit just as easily onto the white album a couple of years previous, but is welcome here too. <br /> <br />\\"One After 909\\" is a top notch rocker,  that was, ironically, written for their first album but let off. They intended to out it out on other albums after, but it always ended up being left out, until \\"Let It Be\\", after which the group split up. <br /> <br />Other highlights include \\"Across The Universe\\", \\"Long and Winding Road\\", \\"For You Blue\\" and \\"Dig It\\" (a jam session).  <br /> <br />Also included is studio talk from the Beatles, which I find nice as it adds to the \\"live\\" feel and also John and Paul singing the old time \\"Maggie May\\". <br />
B000002Q88|5.0|I was floored when this album came out in 1988.  I remember taking a trip to England and this was the only cassette I played on my walkman.  I frequently put the cd on when I'm driving and am still amazed by \\"Ghosts\\", \\"The Preacher\\" and \\"Rainmaker\\".  The emotion put into this album was incredible.  If you have avoided this Kansas album, I would definitely reconsider.  This ranks second only to \\"Leftoverture\\" to me in terms of best albums.
B00000K0E5|4.0|For nearly 40 years one man has consistently protected our basic freedoms all over the world.  This one man has thwarted countless terrorist plots ranging from an attack on Fort Knox to commandeering of a space station, from countless minions of evil to femme fatales.  One man has withstood all and still come out on top with a sexy woman to love and a martini that is shaken, not stirred.  This man is none other than MI-6's famous agent 007, James Bond.    In \\"007:  Goldeneye\\", James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is still living life in the fast lane as MI-6's most notorious secret agent.  Constantly looking for love in all the wrong places, and torturing terrorists when the occasion arises, there always seems to be something for Agent 007 to do to stay busy.  So when an incredibly powerful satellite codenamed `Goldeneye' is taken over by a former MI-6 agent (Sean Bean) and friend of James Bond, it's up to Bond to determine how to stop this former agent and his femme fatale bodyguard (Famke Janssen) before `Goldeneye' is used for unspeakable acts of terror.    Director Martin Campbell (\\"The Mask of Zorro\\") breathes new life into the legacy of 007, with his energetic style of direction; he creates the perfect environment for the James Bond of the late-nineties.  Pierce Brosnan taking over the role of James Bond from actor Timothy Dalton becomes the 5th actor to take on the coveted role of MI-6's bad boy secret agent.  Brosnan turns in a fairly solid performance, although he did seem to be a little uncomfortable in the role, as it was his first big time leading role in a movie.  His performance greatly improved in the next 4 Bond films that he starred in.  Very talented actors and actresses portrayed the supporting roles that aided 007 in his quest to save the world, Robbie Coltrane and Judi Dench both deliver strong performances and continued to reprise their roles in all of the Pierce Brosnan sequels.  The villains as portrayed mainly by Sean Bean as the evil version of 007,and his ultra-sexy femme fatale played by Famke Janssen, were very realistic and thoroughly engaging to watch.  Throughout all of the James Bond films there has always been one constant, well make that two constants, one is the always present Aston Martin that 007 drives, and the other is the gadget master himself, Q.  No matter what the impending disaster may throw his way, Agent 007 will always be prepared for battle.    With 40 years of cinematic history under his belt, some would say that 007's days are numbered, but in my opinion if the world needs to be saved or a sexy woman needs a good man, James Bond will always be needed.  \\"007:  Goldeneye\\" is by no means the best James Bond movie ever made; however, it is still a very solid effort and in my humble opinion, better than any of the Bond movies Roger Moore starred in.  If you're a fan of Agent 007, or merely wanting to see what all the fuss is about, \\"007:  Goldeneye\\" is a perfect starting point, since everytime a new actor is cast as Bond, it's basically a rejuvenation for the character.  Plus each movie is self-contained so there is really no overall story or order to follow.  So basically jump on the James Bond bandwagon anytime you like.  I promise, you cannot go wrong with this character.    \\"007:  Goldeneye\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sexuality.

B00005JNRE|5.0|A wonderfully colorful and magical film, Nanny McPhee is full of surprises. Starting from the children's calm feast on the \\"baby\\", you become immersed in a world of sillyness, playfulness, and make-believe.  <br />When you first see Nanny Mcphee (Emma Thompson, who also wrote the talented and funny screenplay), you are put of by her her outward hideousness. After a while, though, you realize that her warts contain unmeasurable wisdom and that without her tooth she really isn't quite the same. <br />This film is complemented by the presence of Colin Firth as Mr. Brown, the children's loving father who is willing to sacrifice all for his family, Kelly McDonald, who presents a fresh-faced and friendly Evangeline after portraing Peter Pan in Finding Neverland, and Angela Lansbury, the who suceeds at presenting the chilling aunt, and Celia Imrie who is the stuff of kids' nightmares as the in-your-face, repelling, insidious, step-mother-to-be. The children are also perfect and portray their characters in very convincing ways. <br /> I saw this movie in a theater crowded with kids. They created an atmosphere that allowed me to hate the villian, cheer the hero, and believe that happily-ever-after has a place in our lives, after all.

B00006G8K0|4.0|The first in Hammer Studios's reknowned Dracula series - and one of their first horror movies overall - \\"Horror Of Dracula\\" pits icons Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing against each other in perhaps their greatest of many rivalries.  Lee is Dracula, Cushing is Dr. Van Helsing, and \\"Horror Of Dracula\\" is one of the best horror films of the fifties, one of a small number from the latter part of that decade that would set the stage for numerous fright films to come over the next 15-20 years, both Hammer and otherwise. <br /> <br />   On the technical side, it was a bit rough around the edges - I find that most of the very early Hammers were like that compared to the improved production found a few years later in movies like \\"Night Creatures\\", \\"Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter\\" and \\"Paranoiac\\".  With the earnestness of the storytelling and the quality of the performances (again, among the best of the early Hammers) though, this is a minor quibble.  Dracula himself is, perhaps surprisingly, seen relatively little during most of the show.  Everybody references \\"Jaws\\" when talking about a movie where the monster or main threat is mostly felt and not seen (as in \\"Aliens\\", \\"Hellraiser: Inferno\\", etc.), either in the movie's first half or all the way through, and while \\"Jaws\\" was certainly very effective and influential in that technique, \\"Horror Of Dracula\\" shows how much further back it went.  Christopher Lee is magnificent with his small number of lines and short onscreen time, able to convey much in a single sentence, or briefly glimpsed in a doorway, and gives off the impression of there being much more power and darkness to the character than what we're seeing.  Personally, I was left with the impression that the Count is still, in this movie, in the early stages of 'powering up' to some vast, centuries-long - and possibly apocalyptic - masterplan.  And Lee captures, as any actor must to play the Lord Of The Vampires, that grandeur and pure Impressiveness.  Cushing, for his part, makes possibly the best Van Helsing ever, exuding both a quiet charisma and a simple, unpretentious and unwavering devotion to combatting the forces of darkness and preventing the suffering of the innocent.  Michael Gough, Melissa Stribling and the rest of the cast also turn in fine performances; the actress who played the housekeeper's little girl also deserves a special mention (I'm sorry I don't recall her name). <br /> <br />   The story continues in a number of sequels starting with \\"Brides Of Dracula\\" (included in the excellent \\"Hammer Horror Series\\" collection) which sees Cushing return as Van Helsing and brings in new vampires but is missing Dracula himself; and bringing Lee back as the Count for the rest of the series starting with \\"Dracula: Prince Of Darkness\\" (which unfortunately is out-of-print at present).

B000AP04FG|4.0|This is THE movie. The movie that supposedly broke up Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. The movie that lingered in the background of the countless tabloid articles that graced our newstands. The movie that brought Brad Pitt together with Angelina Jolie and her kids. In fact, so many things have been surrounding this movie that people tend to miss one very important thing...simply put, this movie ROCKS! <br /> <br />The movie's premise is pretty straightforward. A couple's marriage is on the rocks. But the fact that eludes both of them is that they are both assassins. One day however, Jane is asked to kill a target, that John is supposed to kill as well. They then learn the true identity of each another and because their cover is blown, are ordered to eliminate each other. The story ensues... <br /> <br />The story is pretty simple. Hardly anything extremely intelligent or thought-provoking. One thing I loved about the movie however, was the on screen chemistry between not just the two leads, but everyone involved. It helps that the movie had some of the best, most sarcastic dialogue I've heard in a long time. The banter and quick quips between John and Jane was highly entertaining. They were a joy to watch. Doug Liman has been churning out great movies like Swingers, Go and The Bourne series and he continues the tradition here. He has a gift for identifying what the audience wants, and if you realize he has dabbled in movies from different genres and pulling them all off with his own style.  <br /> <br />The acting, especially between Brad and Jolie definitely made the movie much more than it actually was. The passion comes full force when they try to outdo and kill each other. There's a certain sensuality they bring to the characters. This is more sexy than romantic, and I'm not really surprised they fell for each other after the making of this movie. I don't know about real life, but they made a fantastic couple here, neither backing down and both exchanging creative insults. Add a healthy dosage of one of my favorite comedians of all time, Vince Vaughn and you already have a killer movie (no pun intended). <br /> <br />Of course, the movie had it's share of absurdity and unrealistic action sequences, but Doug Liman knows this. That's why he never pretends to take the movie seriously because he knows it's all in the name of fun. And that's what makes the movie a blast. In the end, it all comes together very nicely. <br /> <br />When you think about \\"feel good\\" movies, it doesn't get any better than this. Charming leads, respectable plot, humor, action, witty dialogue...it definitely does not disappoint...perfect for laying back and just enjoying. Thumbs up!
B000065BPB|4.0|This headphones are what a typically use with my computer, a cd player at home, and other such general uses.  I have a numerous collection of headphones, many of which are Sennheiser because I find the quality of all their audio products to be quite high.  With that in mind specific attributes that I dislike or like about this model are as follows: <br /> <br />Pros <br />1. These can keep enough sound out of the room that I can use them when I need to record vocalists.  They encapsulate a lot of sound. <br />2. Overall they have a high quality in comparison to a lot of other closed back headphones <br />3. Sennheiser warranty will cover most damages caused in typical use.  Turn around time for me was three weeks from the day I shipped it to when it came back in the mail.  The cost was only shipping it to Connecticut. <br /> <br />Cons (versus other Sennheiser models in particular) <br />1. The cord is the twirly type which gets tangled easily, pulls on your head, and generally annoys the piss out of anyone trying to play an instrument or sing. <br />2. Does not have a plug-in for the cord on the headphone side.  If somebody yanks the cord out the solder joint will be broken and the headphones will require repair. <br />3. Bass reproduction is somewhat limited in closed back headphones, but drummers and bass players complain about not having enough bass in them.  Of course that is also what they'll typically say about a pair of $2800 near field studio monitors.  For general use it has plenty. <br />4. Too heavy for my taste, after awhile you can start to feel that you've been wearing them for a bit too long. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend these headphones for someone who wants a  <br />durable, mid-to-high quality headphone.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is one of the few albums since the 60's that I can listen the whole way through and still love it. The only other album to ever have that distinction for me is Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. AFD is one of the best hard rock albums of all time and the definite best of the past 30 years because of all the amazing songs with guitar work by the best Guitarist in my opinion, Slash.
B0009R1T7M|3.0|I really wanted to like this CD since there was so much hype, however I am underwhelmed by it. It's not terrible but it's not the second coming either. It sounds pretty much like everything in this genre. It seems to evoke Nick Drake and then fails to live up to the comparison. <br /> <br />I'm trying really hard to not be too rough because I really admire the effort and I can appreciate the music for that. Still if I hadn't gotten it for eight bucks at Best Buy I probably wouldn't be quite so generous.
0307276902|5.0|I have kept up with all of the controversy with Mr. Frey's work.  However, the things that are in dispute had no bearing on the most important element of the book, which is the description of his addiction and its hold on him.  I had an alcoholic father and at 42 years old had never understood his addiction until I read Mr. Frey's book.  I had read lots of other books that didn't describe his disease nearly as well as Mr. Frey's did in the first 100 pages of his book.  Thank you Mr. Frey, I will always cherish this book as the one that gave me the answers I needed.
B000CPH9I4|5.0|I just bought this album, never thinking it would have a US release.  This album really seems to bring the Corrs back to what's familiar, to them and to the fans.  This has got to be their most 'organic' studio production yet and it's nice to see them honoring their late mother's music in this compilation of songs.  The songs are not typical releases by the Corrs, but they give their take on these irish tunes. It's a very good listen. I recommend it.
0307276902|4.0|Addicts are dramatic and they tend to lie. I knew this and as someone else said I saw through the grandiose elements.   If the story is fiction or half-truths its core is meaningful.  Frey is a great storyteller, we can all learn something from his brave journey back into enjoying life.  Without a doubt his emotions are raw & brutally honest.
B000002L99|4.0|And this was the beginning of the band's era that we now refer to as Van Hagar. This album was released in 1986, and it defintiely sounds like it. Alex Van Halen uses electronic drums that all the drummers were using in those days. A few of the songs are very heavy on Eddie's keyboards, but the album still has its fair share of rockers. <br /> <br />The album kicks off with one of those rockers, which is Good Enough. Sammy belts out \\"HELLOOOOOOO BABY!\\" at the beginning and then BAM! the band commences to rock our asses off. Sammy really lets his voice loose on here, and Eddie shines on his solo. Another kickass song is Get Up, a very fast-paced song that beats you upside the head. It's almost impossible not to mosh to this one. Dreams is a catchy song with a nice keyboard intro. Very optimistic lyrics and a NICE guitar solo by Eddie. Sammy's voice is nothing short of incredible on this song. Best of Both Worlds is a nice upbeat tune, while 5150 is another catchy song with a great chorus (you'll have this song in your head all day, don't say I didn't warn you).  <br /> <br />Summer Nights is another enjoyable song that will get your head bobbing. Why Can't This Be Love is a pop song driven by keyboards. This song was a big hit for the band back in the day. Love Walks In is an awesome ballad with some of Eddie's best keyboard work. Sammy was born to sing this song, just listen to that emotion he carries. Inside is a decent closer, not a favorite of mine, but it's good enough. <br /> <br />A lot of Van Halen fans will insist that the band ended after David Lee Roth left, but that is their loss. Give the Hagar stuff a chance people! You're missing out on some great music!
0684824906|4.0|The Civil War in general and President Lincoln in particular may be one of the few areas of study where one occasionally suspects that there is nothing more to be written.  Yet through the endless river of books on the subject, more often than not repetitive and derivative, Ms. Goodwin to her great credit demonstrates that there is always a new and interesting angle from which to observe even the most deeply studied subjects.  In order to better understand the particulars of her interesting work of comparative biography, one needs to first examine what it is, and what it is not.   <br /> <br />Many reviewers complain that Team of Rivals does not sufficiently examine battles, generals, and the political and economic conflicts that brought on the Civil War.  Such gripes appear more than a little strange, as none involve the purpose of the book.  Ms. Goodwin wishes to achieve a pair of objectives, both of which are interesting and one of which stands as particularly innovative.  In the first place she wishes to place Lincoln in a context, not simply in terms of his time, but in terms of those who were his political rivals.  Thus the first third of the book offers comparative biographies of Lincoln's political rivals, all of whom seemed at first blush more likely to gain the Republican nomination, and all of whom he appointed to powerful positions in his cabinet.  They are New York senator William H. Seward, who became secretary of state; Ohio senator Salmon P. Chase, who signed on as secretary of the treasury and later was nominated by Lincoln to be chief justice of the Supreme Court; and Missouri's \\"distinguished elder statesman\\" Edward Bates, who served as attorney general.  By offering contrasts to men of office of time, Ms. Goodwin deepens our understanding of the extraordinary distance Abraham Lincoln traveled to the White House. <br /> <br />The other interesting, though less original, piece of this work consists of an examination of Lincoln's appointment and management of this group of intelligent and accomplished men after appointing them to his cabinet.  Though I have read a few Lincoln biographies, none make the point as well as Ms. Goodwin the unique nature of this particular cabinet.  Think of any modern presidency and imagine the president appointing his rivals in the primary to the cabinet, and not merely to any post, but to the three most powerful in the land.  Thus we see not only Lincoln's confidence and political skills, but also his hunger to surround himself with people of extraordinary talent, the mark of great leadership.  The book further examines his deft management of this highly ambitious and fractious group, though I found this in many ways the weakest and least original part of the work.   <br /> <br />If any weakness stands out in this work it is that Ms. Goodwin offers only a cursory examination of these men's lives after Lincoln's death and after they left office.  That is unfortunate.  Since all of three wished to sit in the President's chair, and two of three of them if elected would have almost certainly moved against slavery, one wonders whether they might not have met Lincoln's same fate.  Having walked along side greatness and provided assistance in perhaps the central task of American history - winning the Civil War - it would be interesting to see how this work impacted the rest of their lives.  Of course each of them is covered in their own biographies, so I suppose the weight falls on my shoulders to look elsewhere for these details. <br /> <br />Either way, any one interested in politics in general or the Civil War in particular would certainly find much illumination in this interesting work.   <br />
0307263118|1.0|This is a typical sub-200 page book where the author clearly cares more about sentence structure, obscure metaphors, word-of-the-day vocab, and page after page of descriptions of hair and clothes and the sea and the trees and the weather, than about a good story (or any story at all). To top it off most of the characters (who receive considerably less attention than a barrel of water, the inside of a house, the benches and the beach) die. Not only boring but depressing, \\"just another of the great world's shrugs of indifference\\".
B000BISBDY|4.0|Obviously there are going to be great songs left off of a single cd collection. \\"Don't take your guns to town\\" and \\"Ballad of Ira Hayes\\" come to mind along with many others. But what gets me is the alternate version of \\"The man comes around\\". What the hell were they thinking. Replace what might have been the greatest song he ever did with an inferior version. If they needed to include one from the Unearthed box set it should have been \\"A Singer Of Songs\\" <br />That one sums it all up just about as well as \\"Hurt\\". A fitting finale on this very good but sparse best of cd.
B00000K31V|4.0|Take the uncertainty of what is real and what is fantasy in a completely submersive \\"reality game\\" and add the visualizations that gave Videodrome its punch and you have eXistenZ. <br />The only problem is that you have to get through the movie, which doesn't seem to make sense at times, to get to the punchline at the end.
B000002KIK|4.0|Now, yes, this may be the least Sabbath sounding album in the band's catalog, but it is not a bad album by any means. Sure, it doesn't match to some of their previous albums, and it's not nearly as heavy or dark, but it is still an album worth checking out. <br /> <br />The album gets off to a nice start with Never Say Die, probably the best known song on here. A nice upbeat rock and roll song, with a chorus that I think all Sabbath fans know: \\"Don't you ever....don't ever say die!\\" Now that's what I'm talking about! Junior's Eyes is an emotional song written about the death of Ozzy's father. You can really hear the sadnessin his voice on this one. Some real tear-jerking lyrics, as well. Shock Wave is another cool rock song, very catchy as well. Very underrated this song is. Over to You is a nice tune, but it gets a bit dull at points. Not a bad song, but not a great one either. <br /> <br />This album also gets experimental at points. Breakout is a neat little jazz instrumental. Yes, I said jazz, but no worries, Duke Ellington this is not. Just a cool experimental song with some nice saxophone work. Another thing this album has is great keyboard work by Don Airey. Johnny Blade has a nice keyboard intro, and the song is very new wavish. New wave music was starting to become quite popular around this time (1978) and the band was probably trying to fit in. Air Dance is a soft song. Lots of fans hate it, but I love it. Ozzy puts some good emotion into it, and the keyboards at the end are amazing. <br /> <br />The two songs I don't care for are A Hard Road because it seems to plod along aimlessly, and Swinging the Chain. Drummer Bill Ward sings this one. It has more of a bluesy feel, but it just sounds too awkward on here. But overall, this is an extremely underrated album, and it deserves at least a listen. So be open-minded about it! You may be surprised!
B00009QG73|5.0|Well filmed, great show, good extras, and absolutely astounding music.  I can't believe how good they sound.  All of the smiles on stage are nice too.  Looks like everyone is really enjoying themselves. <br /> <br />I don't understand any of the comments I'm reading about Ferry's voice.  Weak?  You don't get it.  Ferry's voice is not a natural voice, he sings like he is an instrument.  Try singing along and you'll see what I mean.  No one sounds like him.  He's still right on after all these years. <br /> <br />Please note that the mix is more a reflection of the way a concert sounds (which is probably a wise choice), this is as opposed to specific channels with locateable instruments in the sound field as some concert DVDs are recorded.  U2s DVD comes to mind as more of a studio mix than a concert - don't get me wrong, I liked that one too, it's just a different sound. <br />
B000059TFO|4.0|This is a great movie on the grounds that Jim Crow Mississippi was a fascist state, where Blacks were subjected to second-class \\"citizenship\\" (or, as Malcolm X rightfully called \\"20th Century Slaves\\").  THAT historical viewpoint was correct.  However, like nearly all Hollywood films depicting historical events (Like Nixon, JFK, Malcolm X, etc), the writers and directors can't help but to add Hollywood in the films.  The way Chaney, Schwerner and Goodman died was way off.  They weren't simply shot (as if THAT'S not bad enough), the three kids were dragged out the car, and beat with chains, pistol whipped, and the scum who carried out the murder made them beg for their lives...then shot them.  This movie totally romanticized the role the FBI played in their forced \\"fight\\" against the Klan.  When the FBI witnessed crimes, and police brutality, all they did was take notes, and did nothing else.  Also, the Black people were so impersonal.  Though the movie revolved around their treatment, they just stood in the background as impersonal objects.  Don't get me wrong now; I think EVERYONE should see this movie.  Just know that Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney were not at all protected by the FBI, and that it took a mass movement for the government to finally cave in (or there REALLY would have been trouble in the streets) and pass a so-called \\"Civil Rights Bill\\" that took only 100 years to sign.  The actors in the movie were excellent.  Hackman was great.  Dafoe was great.  It made you mad, sad and happy.  Definitely see the movie.  Just don't take it as a historical reference.  Watch Murder in Mississippi to find out the lives of the three, and what they did.  Also, read Three Lives for Mississippi.<br /><br />One last thing, I hope that SOB Edgar Ray Killen faces a death squad.  In case you don't know, Killen was the one who orchestrated the murder of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner, and was conviced exactly 41 years after the act committed on June 21st, 1964.<br /><br />Anton Batey>Anton Batey <br />
B0000214F0|4.0|If this movie offends and shocks you, it's supposed to. This is not a Walt Disney feel good flick, its a flick about a dark side of human nature told in a realistic fashion.It is not possible to give an accurate view of Caligula and his times, without showing graphic, violent, and explicit material. Caligula was a man out to offend the conservative Rome of his great-grandfather Augustus at best, and completely ridicule and torture and kill at his worst.Ultimately, the Romans did kill him for it. <br /> <br />The movie did an excellent job in a historical context. It was very well researched, and gives a highly useful perspective on this part of Roman society at the time. The primary cast was outstanding and developed their characters exceedingly well. I do disagree with the intimacy of the relationship of Caligula with his sister Drusilla(I think that was something he did for shock value to irritate his grandmother Antonia), but by and large, I think everyone behaved quite on par with the values and context of the time. Better than Gladiator in many ways, which also did an excellent job in a historical(fiction) context. <br /> <br />The costuming and scenery was somewhat garish, but often very realistic. We must remember that the Romans were very concerned with fertility, as underpopulation was a real danger. Genetalia was reflected everywhere, and Priapus was quite an important God. This was a society that was so pragmatic it had a shrine next to a latrine door in Pompeii with Fortuna blessing a man defecating. So again, one must expect things to not be entirely to our flavour if its going to give some sense of truth. Yes, the wigs were something wild based on later Flavian hairstyles, and the Preatorian stuff a bit chinsey, but certainly no worse than many other Hollywood on the Tiber flicks. Same with the film and soundtrack.  <br /> <br />Where this movie fell down, like so many others, is when the use of explicitness, or violence, etc, gets in the way of the storyline. Too many times penthouse was allowed to get in the way with pointless sex. The violation at the wedding of Proculus and Livia, and the public birthing of Julia Drusilla (poor Caesonia)would be right on par with what Caligula would do, and causes the disgust it should. The scene that has the Caligula, Drusilla, Caesonia threesome is too long, and the simultaneous back room female duo is absolutely a waste of footage. Some of the activites in the brothel scene really just end in breaking up what was an outstanding moment for understanding the sense of ridiculous, and intersting character development between major characters. Ditto on some of Tiberius' love harem. Really, it is what kept this movie from being a five star. With such a stellar cast and good story, they could have flushed out the character dynamics more, such as Caligula's pride in his daughter, and the restraining influence of Caesonia, and her own far more gracious  hence tragic death. ( I mean really, do you think the woman had a whole lot of choice?) <br /> <br />What always amazes me is that people would find this movie so offensive, and punish it accordingly, yet offer academy awards to Schindler's List and Dances with Wolves-very offensive to me. Both of those films suffer from similar problems in unecesarry/overworked violence or graphic displays, and don't even have the acting quality to back it up. If the scores and film quality were better, they should have been, having been filmed later. They were 3 stars at best. <br /> <br />Over all, a bit unfortunate. I honestly believe the movie had all the makings of a five star great. I still enjoy it, I just fast fowrd through the annoying useless bits. Those who condemn the movie based on explicit content need to stick to Disney or half truths.  Those who are interested in looking at some darker parts in human history, give it a couple of viewings, becuase there is a lot of subtle interplay going on, and you might miss it thanks to unwanted distractions.  <br /> <br />The uncut version in any case is ABSOLUTELY for adults. The cut vesion should be fine for educated teens.
B000301YY8|5.0|If there is a bad review for this cd, do me a favor.  Read their past reviews.  What a joke.  You guys have no clue what music is supposed to sound like, and when you hear it, you hate hate hate hate hate hate hate.  Well its good to see that absolutely nobody finds these reviews helpful, because seriously how could you after you listen to one of the most beautiful cds I have ever heard.  Did one reviewer seriously try to compare James Blunt to coldplay.  Ha ha.  If anything his voice sounds like Dylan or Cat Stevens and the music is something like DAmien Rice or maybe just maybe Coldplay.  But even if you struggle to find a bad song on this perfect gem, you won't, plain and simple you won't.  Disregard negative reviews and do what alot and I mean alot of people are doing, and jump right in.  This is perfection at it's best.
B00008NG5V|5.0|I own all of Jack Johnson's albums and I enjoy every one of them.  His first album was very different than his others in that he wasn't expirienced compared to this next album, where I believe he really found what he enjoys playing and starts to get comfortable with it.   <br /> <br />This album is very relaxed, but with great melodies and calm, yet complex riffs.  The style throughout the album remains the same, which is great to sit back and drift off after a long day.  Pop this in your car on the way home and the stresses of work won't be present after just a few minutes.   <br /> <br />Definitely worth the buy.
B0009QBLA8|1.0|I'm not a film student. Don't pretend any deep knowledge about film styles. The film was dull, and had no real plot. See all the previous reviews for the details. I guess some folks like this sort of thing, but the average guy on the street will give up pretty quickly on this. Painfully, painfully boring. I guess that might be the point.
B0006399FS|1.0|How could anyone like this CD?  The songs are lame, the band members are pretentious, and the whole thing just stinks.  An alleycat in heat sounds better than Bono's \\"singing.\\"  A squealing pig sounds better than The Edge's guitar work.
B00097DXZS|5.0|This is my first Carlos Santana CD that I've ever bought.  I bought it upon a recommendation from a friend and she was right!!  The CD jams from the first track to the last.  My favs are \\"Just Feel Better\\" with Steven Tyler and the Anthony Hamilton track.  Very good, orginal music!! Buy It!!!
B000929AJQ|2.0|I keep hoping NIN will release something as great as BROKEN or THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL or even PRETTY HATE MACHINE, or if not then go somewhere new. Reznor's obviously an incredibly talented musician. And to be fair, SPIRAL was one of the best albums of the 90s, so he's set the bar very high. Now he has a tough decision to make: try to top SPIRAL and fall short more often than not, or try a new direction altogether. WITH TEETH is the former. The same layered, angry, self-loathing stuff as SPIRAL, just not as good.  A few decent tracks, but overall a letdown.
B000BYA5G4|5.0|Many of the reviews of this movie are unusually naive and stupid.<br /><br />My review of this movie is based on a lifetime overseas as the son of an oilman, as a Marine Corps infantry officer, as a clandestine case officer for the Central Intelligence Agency, and as the foremost trainer of governments interested in getting a grip on reality by focusing on open source of information in all languages.<br /><br />This is a first rate movie with some truly extraordinary visuals and some truly extraordinary lines.  It is an intelligence movie for intelligent people, and it should certainly give anyone both a couple of hours of enjoyment, and a couple of hours of reflection.<br /><br />Among the highlights:<br /><br />1)  AK-47 as the real weapon of mass destruction<br /><br />2)  Africans stripping a plane overnight, literally pulling every piece of it off and making it \\"disappear\\"<br /><br />3)  There is one gun for every 12 people, the arms dealers goal is to arm the other 11 as quickly as possible<br /><br />4)  The top arms dealers (\\"merchants of death\\") are the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.<br /><br />I read more than I watch movies, and will end with two comments: a) all of my reading bears out the importance and relevance of this movie; and b) it is easily one of the more serious and appreciable movies I have seen in some time.  The intellect in the devising and presentation of this movie is absolutely first rate.
0307276902|4.0|It is unfortunate that this book has been receiving bad press.  A lot of people have chosen to boycott reading this book because James Frey lied about it being an account of his life.  It's too bad, because they will be missing out on a great book.  If you start reading it, you will soon understand why in the real world, this story isn't fictional at all. <br /> <br />Having experimented with endulgences in my younger years (although not near to his extreme), I can certainly relate to a lot of his inferences.  Most certainly, there are lots of people in this world who can relate to the experiences of James Frey's \\"character\\", and maybe many of those who's life has mirrored it. <br /> <br />I could not put this book down.  It takes you through a drug addict's every thought through the process of his healing.  By the time you finish the book you will have a good understanding of the sickness that unfortunately affects so many lives. <br /> <br />Autobiography or not, this story is compelling and gripping.  If Oprah wants to take it off her book club list, I will have no problem putting it on mine. <br /> <br />Read it.... <br /> <br />
B000BB1MIC|5.0|Just finished watching gilmore girls season 5 on dvd and it was fantastic. Have to order it from amazon as I'm from Australia and they keep taking gg's off air, due to low ratings. <br />Just wanted to say that Season 5 is fantastic and the writing is superb!!! <br />Can't wait to see season 6!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Playing the Angel~ Depeche Mode is outstanding and proves that Depeche Mode is truly a legendary rock/synth band. Dave Gahan sounds amazing and his vocals are on par with some of the best in the business. Martin Gore shows his prowess as far as the lyrics are concerned. Martin is no slouch when it comes to the vocal department either. Gahans lyrics are quite different then what one is used to with Martin. Still and all they are much better then anything that Alan Wilder ever could write. I love the book.let and the photos, font and Corbijn once again totally understands the true nature and mindset of Depeche Mode. I love the heavy inclusion of guitars and it is very well rounded album and possibly one of the best Depeche Mode has ever recorded. I can not reccomend this album strongly enough, this album is a stroke of genius and the lyrics are sublime.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I love animated films of all kinds, but _Spirited Away_ really takes the cake. I had never been into Japanese animation, it seemed somewhat strange to my Western eyes, but this film changed all that. It was like watching _Beauty and the Beast_ for the first time as a child - there was nothing but a sense of awe. The characters are incredibly rich and entertaining. The storyline is complex and very profound, yet any child can enjoy this film. <br /> <br />This to me is why this film is so successful: Children will love the funny characters, animation, and action, and parents can enjoy the underlying questions of family and world position. There is nothing overly deep or dragging, just fantastic storytelling at its best, and an attempt to answer a very Shakespearian question: what's in a name? <br /> <br />I would say one of the top 5 animated films ever created.
6305510016|3.0|\\"\\"Titanic\\" is a spectacular roller coaster ride\\". What is disappointing is the total lack of a plausible script. Does anyone really believe that a charcoal sketch could survive intacked for 70 + years in a safe in the wreck the Titanic? Has anyone ever heard of hypothermia? Does anyone understand that the sucking wash of the sinking Titanic alone would have drowned anyone hanging on to the stern in those last minutes.    Also the movie is heavily derived from other films. Obviously earlier Titanic films such as \\"A Night to Remember\\" But what surprised me was the Second half of the film (DiCaprio, Winslet Love affair) is directly lifted from Michael Curtiz's \\"SEAWOLF\\" (1941) with minor changes to blend into Titanic first half. With $200 million budget + you would think Cameron and company could have done much better.
B000CNDIZE|4.0|Being a fan of Zero 7 I thought her voice was the best of all of the guest vocals on their albums.  I purchased this album solely on her voice.  I have alwys thought her voice was so seductive but I didn't know how her music would sound, but was suprised at how well she has done.  Looking at the liner notes this was a big production and it shows up in all her songs.  I listened a couple of times and seem enjoy it more each time. There's a couple throw away songs that don't really go with the rest of the album, but that doesn't hurt it too much   That's key to a good cd.  If you are a fan of Zero 7 you will like this.  The Ulrich Schnauss remix of Breath Me is wonderful.
B000002JR8|1.0|This band was nothing special at all, especially Dime. Just another run of the mill \\"I'm angry at the world\\" heavy metal band. Maybe when you idiots grow up you will see that, but for now it seems like their the greatest thing since sliced bread... <br /> <br />To Dime's secret admirer, Yeah true, Dave Mustaine once asked him to join Megadeth around 89 or so. But might i also add the fact that Dave was heavily on massive amounts of drugs at the time, so i don't think that really counts towards any credibility. If the junkie down the street asked me to join his band, i don't think it would count for very much because his judgment would be totally impared.  <br /> <br />People act like Dimebag was somekind of messiah to metal guitar playing, but they couldn't be more wrong. For every atribute Dime is praised for (i.e. speed, technical ability, feeling, crunch, heaivness, ect), i could think of atleast 6 or 7 guitarist off the top of my head that could beat him out in one or all of those areas. Shreders like Malmsteen, Paul Gilbert, Jason Becker, Alex Scholnik, Marty Friedman, Kai Hansen, Schenker, ect all possess the ability and skill to make Dimebag cry himself to sleep. So all of you morons claiming him to be the best... he isn't, never was, not even close.  <br /> <br />The whole image of Pantera was a joke, sad that most of you STILL don't even realize it. The \\"ToUgH GuY\\" posturing is all fake. The biggest poser in the band though is Phil. Anyone who claimes to have never lost a fight in his life should be a dead give-away clue to what a lame-poser this man is, as even the toughest and strongest people have atleast lost a few fights in their lives. I'm sure this guy got many @$$ kickings in his teen years by highschool bullies, maybe thats whay he tries to act so tough. <br /> <br />I would not even recommend listening to the samples that this page provides us with, it is some of the most horrible music ever commited to tape. Trust me, want good metal? try out some early Savatge, Mercyful Fate, Accept, Slayer, anything with talent basically.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I know none of you will believe me but it is true I owned a copy of this album then my house got robbed and this album got stolen so I am now on my second copy damn you irony it had to happen to me. No marks for user friendlyness as I cant get the information on the enhanced portion of the cd as I use Mac OSX thanks SOAD secondly this cd is only 36 minutes long and has 16 song meaning bang for buck is a bit lacking. It's System Of A Down it's inventive it's heavy it haunting but it's not as good as there other albums it's a worth while investment thing of it as the the B sides to toxicity you can actually burn the two onto one disc they are that short. Highlights include chic n' stu a rally against consumerism, Boom a rant against bombs , F*** the system a rant about f****** the system and roulette a ballad about I don't know it good all acoustic guitars and stuff.
B000065V1V|4.0|I have started listening to a lot of Bowie again after the astonishing performances captured on \\"Bowie at the Beeb,\\" a must-have for any fan, documenting live performances of Bowie circa 1969-1972.<br /><br />Heathen, of course, is Bowie circa 2002, but I found a lot of similarities to this earlier period.  \\"Slip Away,\\" for example, can be seen as an update on \\"Space Oddity,\\" both in its cadence and chorus.  \\"Slow Burn,\\" with Pete Townsend, is a Bowie classic and stands in good stead with earlier Tony Visconti-produced efforts.  \\"5:15\\" openly recalls the chords and sounds of that glorious era.<br /><br />There is a futuristic sheen to the album which percolates in the story lines and production, but given Bowie's history it's a nostalgic \\"Starman\\" future, one we loved from him and are happy to see him embrace again.  \\"Hang on To Yourself,\\" Ziggy once cried, but with Heathen it's clear Bowie is doing everything possible to tap into that muse and make it work again.<br /><br />A bright, refreshing departure from the dreary last few Bowie records of late, Heathen recalls everything from Man Who Sold the World to Ziggy to Scary Monsters, updated with modern production and passionate performances.  If you've given up on recent Bowie this one is well-worth a listen.
B00005QG9J|5.0|After a shakey start to their career Incubus came good with there album S.C.I.E.N.C.E then a spectacular follow up Make Yourself . Here is the breakdown of Morning View the album into quantifiable parts 30 percent heavy riffs as observed on Nice To Know You, Circles, Have You Ever, 30 percent Melodic crooning as best observed on Mexico, Wish You Were Here , 30 Percent delicate guitar and other instrument and 10 percent turntablism and other sound effects as evident in Just A Phase. But 100 percent brilliant. This is the sound of Incubus growing up this is the sound of the best week of my life. Brandon Boyd proving that singing is just as effective as full on shout. The album paints with a full range of instrument and vocal styles but it's all good solid rock not a bit of nu-metal. If I was to pick out a bad track ths would be hard well blood on ground is not as immediately brilliant but it kinda fits in the album. 11am is the most underrated song in my book I think it has very meaningful lyrics and great music. If your a hard rock fan chill out relax for an hour put morning view on then you can go back to pounding your head in to submission Morning View is the light in a bleak world of rock, a must for anyone.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|What makes this third album of the Strokes so exceptional? For sure is the most sophisticated of all three.  Also is the one that puts them in the list of the remarkable rock bands of the decade for using the cool sounds combined with Julian Casablanca's characteristic voice in an amazing result. It is really hard to describe the real cause for the feeling of optimism you get after listening to it but you will realize that this group is able to give much  more in the future.
B000021YQV|5.0|From the opening blast of guitar to the hushed vocals you know this is not your average nu-metal wannabe crap this is serious Serj spits lyric of over crowded prisons and general rhetoric at a speed of a jet plane and Daron squeals about smacking bitches, on paper it sounds insane. Just to prove that they can turn gibberish into a song they put on Bounce this song makes hardly any sense but it can make you smile and it's as heavy as a blow to the head. The vocal style ranges from shout, speaking, singing and crooning Daron sings a lot more but not as much as new releases some say this good thing but Serj is the main focus which is a very good thing. My favoutite song obviously would be chop suey if it was not played so much but ATWA this song seems mellow then goes crazy like Serj is experience a fit then mellow again. I don't really particularly care about the motives behing the songs the lyrics to me are not important its the distinctive way that they are delivered. This is intelligent music for everyone the little goth kid will like it the car salesman from woking will like it as long as he is not into dance music. A must for all collections. oh yeah the only thing I don't like is the reference to pulling a tape worm out of your ass this is quite disturbing you know your intrigued now.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Most of the reviews are one-star complaints about a seeming incompatibility with iTunes.  I feel they should really review the music and the not the packaging, but that's beyond my point.  For those of us who use iTunes and related devices, the solution is quite simple: hold down the shift key while inserting the disc.  Keep it held down for maybe 20 seconds just to be safe.  \\"In Your Honor\\" is now a regular audio CD.  Enjoy.    On to the actual album: \\"In Your Honor\\" is a concept album, with a disc of traditional Foo Fighters rock music, and a disc of more mellow acoustic numbers.  Both are quite good, though not quite on the level of the quintessential Foo Fighters' album, \\"The Color and the Shape.\\"  The electric disc feels a bit old and worn out at times, but catchy hooks keep it on track.  The title track has a regal, slightly marching mood.  Hits \\"Best of You\\" and \\"DOA\\" both bring the Foo Fighters up to a golden standard.  The album progesses, though it feels somewhat reused - songs like \\"Free Me\\" and \\"Resolve\\" just don't feel as inspired as some of Foo Fighter's earlier material.  \\"The Deepest Blues Are Black\\", on the other hand, is a very melodic track.  The second disc is solid, with each track possessing a reflective, somewhat nostalgic feel.  Some fans may be put off by the calmer nature of this disc, but hopefully most will accept the diversity shown by it.  Highlights include \\"Miracle\\", \\"Another Round\\", \\"Over and Out\\", and \\"Cold Day in the Sun.\\"    After two albums of lesser music, the Foo Fighters have finally found their New Way Home.
B000AWYOGE|3.0|I really was going to give Dark Water 2 stars, but looking back and after arguing with my wife (She really liked it) it's not too bad. I think what swayed me to the 3 star side was the acting, all who are in it do quite well, no over-acting, and with a couple of scene stealers. It seems Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is in the middle of a tense custody battle with her ex, he wants her to move closer to him so they can have joint custody, while she wants to move farther away in the city because it's cheaper. She wins (at first) and her and her daughter move to a dumpy, dreary, run-down apartment building in lower Manhattan. Just so happens there was a little girl who was abused and mis-treated by her parents who eventually died, that lived in the apartment right above Dahlia's. Her ghost is not pleased, and soon takes after Dahlia's daughter as the two of them look identical, and she also wants Dahlia to be her new mother.<br /><br />The first 45 minutes are really boring, it takes the movie way too long to get going, but when it does, the last 45 minutes are pretty entertaining. Also, this movie is way to dark, there is little lighting to speak of, and what lighting there is does the viewer no good cuz' you can't see a thing!! I know dark scenes are important to a horror/mystery movie, but not overkill, okay? And of course this got the dreaded 'unrated' tag, which if you have read any of my previous reviews, you know I'm not a big fan of.........at all.<br /><br />As I said earlier, the cast is strong, Connelly plays Dahlia well, a strong, loving mother, but with so many past demons, a brutal custody battle, and her daughter's imaginary friend, she slowly loses control and begins to question her own sanity. John C. Reilly plays Mr. Murray, the owner of the building who talks Dahlia and her daughter into moving in. He is kind of a sleaze but helps Dahlia out in getting her apartment's many leaks and roof damage fixed (These are curteous of our upset little ghost) Pete Postlethwaite plays Veeck, the building's maintenance man, Pete is a character actor who has been around forever and played in over 45 movies. His character wants to somewhat help, but turns out to be more of a creepy guy who plays into the plot more then you will think. Tim Roth, who I've always liked, plays Dahlia's lawyer Platzer, and he is great. He has a meeting with Dahlia in his car, because his office is being \\"painted\\" Turns out he has no office and works out of his car, but it's ok, he is still a decent lawyer nad helps in getting Mr. Murray and Veeck to clean up the apartment.<br /><br />Now here is the strongest reason I can give for the 3 stars instead of 2....Ariel Gade, she plays Cici, Connelly's daughter, and she is phenomenal. Besides being absolutely adorable, she is also quite the little actress, and though it doesnt say in the credits, I think she also plays Natasha, the little girl who dies and comes back to take Dahlia and Cici. I say this because they look exactly alike, and that would be something if this little girl was able to play such a strong dual role....I know alot of people like Dakota Fanning, and I do to, she is a hell of an actress, but watch out for this kid, she could really be something.<br /><br />So, ok story, strong cast, very little suspense or horror, I know this is a remake of a popular Japanese movie, and I hear it's much better. I am a huge fan of both The Ring and The Grudge, both remakes of Japanese movies, Dark Water comes nowhere close to those two, but it's worth the 3.79 for a decent nighs's viewing.<br /><br />acting.....4 stars, Connelly and Reilly are terrific, but remember the name Ariel Gade<br /><br />directing.....3 stars, Maybe the director of the Japanese version could have improved this a bit.<br /><br />special effects....3 stars, Lots and lots of water....too much water<br /><br />horror rating....2.5 stars, Very little scares and chills, a few creepy moments, but generally pretty slow<br /><br />quality.....2.5 stars, Way to dark!!! It's very hard to focus on a scene you know is important when you can't see the dang thing!!tars, Way to dark!!! It's very hard to focus on a scene you know is important when you can't see the dang thing!!
B00076OMW4|3.0|The New World Symphony is the best blended and most musical I've ever heard, but the end of the Polka and Fugue everyone, except the tubist, is playing too loud.  Its blatty and offensive to me especially the trumpets.  Don't get me wrong I like loud playing but not when the whole section is in unison.  Also there is a very loud wrong note in the trumpets in the last statement of the subject!  It's kind of funny!  Anyways everything else about this CD is very good.  Especially the New World Symphony.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|There is a reason the extended scenes hit the cutting room floor in the first place. Childlike dialogue dumbs down a very intelligent film. I can't believe the opening sequence of storyboard drawings were ever intended for audiences to see as part of the film. Did David Lynch have anything to do with this release? Added scenes change the whole feel of the movie. Don't waste your money.
B00079HZUM|5.0|\\"Stage Beauty\\" suffered unfairly from having been released in the wake of \\"Shakespeare in Love.\\" The earlier film had already won the Best Picture Oscar, and suffered a critical and public backlash because it beat out the more deeply admired \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" So no one was in the mood for another gender-bending romantic comedy set in the theater world of Merrie Olde England. \\"Stage Beauty\\" even shared some cast members in common with \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" (Tom Wilkinson, Rupert Everett) and lacked the imprimatur of a screenplay co-written by Tom Stoppard. All this is background for saying that \\"Stage Beauty\\" was unfairly ignored on its first release, because it's every bit as elegant, funny and engrossing as \\"Shakespeare in Love,\\" and more poignant and profound in the bargain. Director Richard Eyre and screenwriter Jeffrey Hatcher create a magical fiction based on the true-life story of Edward Kynaston, an actor celebrated for playing female leads on the Restoration stage, who suddenly found himself out of a job when King Charles II decreed that women, not men, should play women's roles. History tells us that Kynaston soon switched to men's roles and regained his stardom; \\"Stage Beauty\\" contrives to tell us how he accomplished this, and the difficulties he met along the way. As played by Billy Crudup, Kynaston is insufferably arrogant--particularly toward women, whom he feels he knows far better than they do themselves--but his arrogance hides a deeper insecurity about his identity, sexual and otherwise, and his place in the world. Of course the King's decree shatters his world, and it's up to Maria (Claire Danes)--his once-mocked dresser, now a major star--to help him find his way back. Besides having many witty and thoughtful things to say about gender roles in theater and society, \\"Stage Beauty\\" presents a believable scenario for the beginnings of naturalistic acting on the stage--once men and women were free to portray themselves, there was far less need for posturing. The ensemble cast of \\"Stage Beauty\\" is at least as good as that of \\"Shakespeare in Love,\\" and the leads are better. I had never paid much attention to Billy Crudup before this film; after seeing it, I'd have to say he's one of the most underrated actors around, superbly skilled in voice and gesture, and capable of profound depths of feeling as well as witty banter. He's matched fully by Claire Danes, a radiantly beautiful actress of fire and delicacy. Rupert Everett--a master at playing fatuous, self-involved noblemen--is a stitch as Charles II, and Tom Wilkinson is his usual excellent self as Kynaston and Maria's boss in their acting company. Such admirable emissaries from British rep as Edward Fox, Ben Chaplin, Richard Griffiths and Fenella Woolgar also shine in smaller roles. \\"Stage Beauty\\" takes considerable liberties with history--for example, Nell Gwyn, a major character in the story, would have been only about 10 years old at the time \\"Stage Beauty\\" took place. But that shouldn't matter to anyone who enjoys a romantic historical romp, particularly when it's as masterfully done as \\"Stage Beauty.\\"r posturing.

630521610X|5.0|When I saw this in 1996 I didn`t expect much. To my mind, the genre itself has worn thin by then....  But thanks to an inventive brilliant script, direction and performances - it was a mindblower and still is... The constant references to other films and the combined forces of drama, suspense, comedy and slasher - AND THAT IT WORKS - makes THIS an unforgettable experience. It is one of the key films of the 90s.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|\\"Oldboy\\" is as mysterious as it is action-packed.  The story revolves around Dae-su, an overweight, obnoxious drunk who passes out one day and wakes up in a bizarre prison where he'll spend the next 15 years.  He doesn't know where he is, why he's there or who locked him up.  After 15 years of reflection and shadow boxing, he's mysteriously released -- lean, mean, and hungry for revenge, not to mention answers.  But who's getting revenge on whom?    If you enjoy mystery thrillers like \\"Memento\\" and \\"The Usual Suspects\\" and the classic TV series \\"The Prisoner\\" -- the ones where you get the big payoff at the end if you've been paying attention -- you'll like \\"Oldboy,\\" too.  Plus, it's a great revenge story, a la \\"Kill Bill.\\"  It's dark, disturbing, and full of twists and turns.  Plus, you get to see a man eat a live octopus (no special effects).  What more could you ask for?

0765309408|5.0|This book owes a debt to Robert A. Heinlein but it is a refreshing and original work. It was interesting and fun and kept me engaged throughout. It was over too soon. <br /> <br />The situation is that humanity is not alone and it is a rough universe out there. There is not enough prime real estate and many of the other species consider us to be a \\"nutritious and tasty part of a healthy diet.\\" Some are more advanced and some are less. All are different. <br /> <br />Protecting human colonies is a difficult job. You would expect that lots of young recruits would be called for to fill the ranks of the defense force. You would think incorrectly. They actually only recruit from the geriatric crowd. Prostate problems, arthritis, detached retinas, incontinence are not problems. They can be fixed. What is wanted are mature people able to function and to take initiative. They want the old. <br /> <br />Military service does have its bonuses. Young and healthy bodies are provided for the troops and they are definitely enhanced and augmented. They need this help. As I said before, it is a nasty universe out there. The catch is that you don't know what you're singing up for when you put your name on the dotted line. Those recruited don't get to ever go back to earth. All they know is that they will be made young again and that they will serve in the military. Only after enlistment do they learn that most of them will not survive. This is not due to callousness on the part of the brass. It just reflects the sad reality that going to war means an enhanced possibility of death. <br /> <br />This book follows the career of one such geriatric wonder from the time of his enlistment through his first few years of battle. It gives hints as to his ultimate future but does not divulge it. There could be eventual sequel written but the book stands alone. It is complete as is. <br /> <br />The biggest nod to Heinlein comes in being forced to look at things in new ways. The obvious answeris seldom the right one. Thinking outside the box is definitely called for. <br /> <br />It was a great read. <br />
0765315246|4.0|Definitely a page-turning read. The first-person narrative drives the action along, and it has an ironic, `post-modern' feel, exemplified by the treatment of the standard trope of the Marine-style drill sergeant in Part 2.<br /><br />I sense the author is feeling his way in this first novel. The introductory dialogue in chapter 1 is self-consciously clunky (`the recruitment centre'). I felt the rather anal sub-thread throughout the novel was both gratuitously vulgar, as well as unrealistic: I think most people with a sophisticated networked AI implant would relate to it rather positively, rather than the derogatory approach taken by most of his characters. Towards the end of the novel, the author has to climb an exposed 150 metre tower (p.296). This would be a terrifying experience for most people, but the episode is not exploited, and the hero executes it in matter-of-fact style.<br /><br />The plotting is event-driven, but some suspension of disbelief is called for: the hero's `double-shot' technique which brings him wild acclaim, and propels the plot forward, doesn't seem that big a deal. The five-on-five confrontation with the main aliens, with its significant unpreparedness for success, seems a little implausible.<br /><br />I think the deeper issue here is that the author is enthusiastic about the action and the science/technology, but is less excited about plausible motivations - both on the human side and on the alien. The shallow and primary-colour style sketching of motivation creates a sense of unreality which detracts from the potential depth of the novel. I am re-reading `Days of Cain' by J. R. Dunn which does all this brilliantly, so that's my benchmark.<br /><br />It would be conventional to point out the stereotyped characterisation, particularly of minor characters, but you don't always have to develop all the characters in an action-oriented thriller. John Perry and Jane Sagan sufficiently make sense, and that's enough for this to work. The wife-relationship theme is original, and one of the things that work best: it looks like the author actually cares about this. Recommended.he wife-relationship theme is original, and one of the things that work best: it looks like the author actually cares about this. Recommended. <br />
B0007M22TI|5.0|I read through a number of the reviews for this CD and found that for the most part, people loved it as do I.  A few commented that it lacked soul. <br /> <br />I guess I can understand this comment in a world where everyone wants flash over content but let me say this about these woman: <br /> <br />Their voices are some of the best trained voices I have ever heard.  There is no comparision between their voices and a lot of the pop crap out their these days that may have more flash but no technique.  The only way I could describe Chloe's voice is angelic and per Ave Maria is deeply moving.  I can't imagine believing that anyone things this music is wihthout soul. <br /> <br />One review called this Musak.  I hate Musak and this is certainly not that.  Anyone who compares this to musak knows nothing about music but I suppose that years of pop crap do dull ones sensibilities. <br /> <br />It is my hope that this kind of music can become more popular.  The woman have incredible talent and soul and their message is so much more positive than the music you hear on the radio today. <br /> <br />I also love their beautiful feminine dresses and reserved sensibilities and beauty when all the pop stars think that the only way to enterain people is to take your clothes off. <br /> <br />A hearty glass raised and slainte to Irish Woman who have shown the pop world what it really means to have talent and class. <br /> <br />John M.
B000000OUJ|5.0|I don't even know if kids nowadays know about this cd or even this rapper. Basically, this is the best east coast rap cd ever released. Non-commerical, so not many know about it. Listen to the samples on here. Lyrically, it crushes. The entire album is atmopsheric. It's a story. The Gza slashed up buttholes like Mexican food.

B000BQQZXY|5.0|All This fab four wanted to do was make an album and songs \\"that girls can dance to\\" well they acheived that and much much more. I love Franz Ferdinand, but not to be so biased I am saying that the songs are kind of repetetive, yet if you know every word to every song (like I do...sigh, I need a life) you can tell the difference. the best songs on the CD were, The Fallen (sweet guitars), Do You Want To? (Yes I do!) and many others. Much of their old stuff is great, but the new stuff is awesome! Cheers!
B0000029DD|5.0|Though a frequent customer of Amazon.com over many years from \\"pneumatic adhesive dispensers to Japanese food\\", I rarely write reviews, however in this case I feel OBLIGATED as it would deprive SO MANY of such beautiful work.  Jeff Buckley sadly only leaves a small legacy due to his untimely and tragic death.  This album is a 10+ no matter which style of music you prefer (classical to hip hop).  His voice, lyrics and the production of this album are absolutely exquisite. <br /> <br />Jeff Buckley will live forever in the hearts of many including myself :-)  He has given us food for the soul.  God Bless you Jeff Buckley :-) <br />
1400032717|3.0|This is a book about the life and thought process that an autistic teen experiences, and the reactions of family an others.  It made me think about how I tend to expect others to have the same thought process as me, and how wrong I am to assume that is the case.   Simply written and an easy read.  A good book, light-hearted, but not one that I couldn't want to see what the next page said.

0553579908|5.0|I must admit that coming off of George R.R. Martin's first book, \\"A Game of Thrones\\", I was anticipating a ride quite like the one I first experienced.  Well, for all of you Martin fans out there, you are in for a ride which is both new and old, but in the end fulfilling. <br /> <br />The true strength of this narrative is in its interlinking of story lines.  The predecessor to this installment had highly coupled story threads.  I must admit that \\"A Clash of Kings\\" begins without the same coupling.  However, if you so decide to read it, stick with it.  The novel reminds me of a long series of disharmonious chords on an organ.  With each chapter, you are waiting for a resolution which ties it to the bigger picture.  However, each thread is at least a progression of these chords waiting upon resolution.  While reading about each character, you are taken back into their storyline entirely, so as to not be too confused at least.  Don't get me wrong, however.  There are various interlinking moments even at the beginning.  However, further into the narrative, the threads come together like a grand organ symphony, each set of pipes playing to the other. <br /> <br />Characteristic of Martin, his characters hard to get a grasp on.  The story has a pervasive sense of dread, as one has much difficulty seeing the depths of each character.  He also has a relatively bleak estimation the members of the gentry in his world.  However, as man is fallen in the world as we know it, it is not much of a stretch to imagine that the call of power for these lords would corrupt them in so many subtle (and sometimes large) ways.   Nevertheless, he does raise up characters who have desirable goodness in their hearts.  One is often drawn to his more \\"simple\\" characters who are in service to the lords than to the lords themselves.  The servile individuals are given quite the characterization of good from Ser Roderick to Ser Jorah and even Edmure Tully.  The strength of others is also exulted.It would be incorrect to judge that it is a hopeless narrative filled with a completely negative view of man. <br /> <br />It is perhaps best to cap this review up like this:  The story is one of political war-time drama.  One can not expect there to be one force of good which seeks to dominate the others because Martin does not portray goodness as seeking such domination.  The story is therefore one of those humble good-folk, with their own character flaws, and how they win and more often lose in the world of political intrigue. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone who has read \\"A Game of Thrones\\". Indeed, if you have read that, you know that this is needed to continue the story on. For those of you who haven't read it, I suggest picking it up and starting the series.  Then you may decide if you want to follow my advice to pick up \\"A Clash of Kings\\".
0316666343|1.0|I love hype.  Who doesn't love anticipation?    As long as you can shrug off the crushing defeat that comes when the veil of hype falls away, who cares? <br /> <br />The Lovely Bones is bad book.  The negative reviews at Amazon are spot-on.  The prose sounds like it was written by a fourteen-year old girl writing a diary entry on her Dell computer while listening to her favorite Ani mix.  The characters appear to be inspired by a long weekend marathon of Dawson's Creek Season 2.  The plot is meandering and it really is a mystery why Susie came back to Earth. <br /> <br />Mr Harvey's fate was the most frustrating point for me.  Come on, falling into a snowy ravine?  Deus ex machinas can be better than this!  I only find myself wishing for The Great Crossover Potential of the dude in the wheelchair from the Da Vinci Code coming to off Mr Harvey as he watched an episode of \\"24\\".  Man, that would have been sweet....  Think of the hype!
1573229725|5.0|Sarah Waters is a rare find.  I stumbled upon this book because I have been on a kick for Victorian Era books, movies, and TV shows.<br /><br />The plot is basically that a con man convinces a pickpocket to go in on a scam to swindle a would-be rich young Lady.  The pickpocket, or fingersmith, is to pose as the the rich Lady's personal maid, her Ladies' Maid, and convince her to marry the young man, the con man, that has come to woo her.  Once married the con man can take the Lady's money, throw her in a madhouse, and give the fingersmith some three thousand pounds for her troubles in the plot.  The problem comes when the fingersmith finds herself falling in love and becoming accidentally intimate with the Lady.  The tension mounts as the fingersmith starts to have doubts about the con.
0812550757|2.0|This book really didn't do it for me.  I know it has won tons of awards, and I know most reviewers seem to cherish it, but that was not my experience.  Ender's Game was a coming of age space opera with a conscience.  Card balanced all of the elements to create a masterpiece.  I am not sure what this book is.  Apparently, Ender has become Doctor Phil and inserted himself into a Latin American soap opera (yes I know they were Portugese).  There were certainly some interesting episodes in the book, but overall I was disappointed.
B000850IHW|5.0|Use it to load up that CD player multiple times and hit the repeat button cause you're in for a ride that you won't be able to stop.  Seriously though, this album just is that good. Starting with quite possibly the most original opening to an album ever, the snapping of fingers, and going strong from there, this album delivers without slowing down at all. <br /> <br />Just the Same is the albums in your face opener with great guitar, bass, and synth interplay.  It seems like a fairly standard prog-rock song, but being from Gentle Giant, there is just an added dimension of awesomeness that I can't quite explain.  They mix the complex with the simple in such a way that it sounds unique in ever manner possible. <br /> <br />The second song, On Reflection, is just about as a capella as you can get on a rock album, with a cool xylophone part running throughout the entire course of the song.  In the middle of the song, things change pace with a beautiful ballad and accompanying flute.   <br /> <br />Free Hand is probably the biggest song on the album, in terms of sound and the attack the song brings to the listener. <br /> <br />Time to Kill represents another one of the albums harder-rocking bass-driven songs.  Don't get me wrong though, there is plenty of great guitar and synth worked out through the mix.  This is probably my favorite track from the album.  It usually ends up bringing me to a smile on careful listens, basically from its unique blend of bass behind powerful vocals. <br /> <br />His Last Voyage morphs itself from another beautiful ballad into a screaming, emotion-filled guitar solo, back into a ballad without sounding the least bit forced, it flows marvelously. <br /> <br />Talybont sounds like a quaint little Celtic or Gaelic (I don't know for sure) instrumental track.  It flows right into the next track which is... <br /> <br />Mobile.  Which features great vocal work with a now more upbeat Celtic/Gaelic sound behind it (which the obligatory awesome bass and drums). <br /> <br />Overall, this album amazes me more than just about any other rock album ever put out.  It's not as strange as Gentle Giant's earlier works, but is no less complex and wonderful.  Overall, the mix is perfect.  Vocals, guitar, bass, drumming, synth all mix together seemlessly and one never overriding the other.  A true tour-de-force showing what you can do with a little talent and imagination put forward in a very original way.   <br /> <br />I have to note that although I've heard drummers just as good as the one in Gnetle Giant, I've never quite heard a bass player with such a thunderous, yet, in a way, gentle, sound.  But when you combine the two together, it makes for one hell of a rythm section that could rival just about any I can think of. (And don't get me wrong, the drumming is still fantastic.  I think today's music would be a lot better in the instrumental department if there were more drummers like the one from Gentle Giant.) <br />
B000301YY8|5.0|Lately, it's rare that I find a new CD that I truly love.  Well it's time to put that feeling to rest.  Today, I purchased Back to Bedlam by James Blunt. <br /> <br />I know many are put off by the array of current pop artists, but James Blunt deserves a chance.  Every song is pure delight.  James Blunt pours his heart and soul into each composition and his emotions shine through.  This is not one of those CDs that you buy for the hit single and hate the rest.  The rest is a bonus; because its just as good, if not better, than the hits.  In addition to \\"You're Beautiful\\" and \\"Goodbye My Lover\\", my favorite tracks are \\"Wisemen\\", \\"Tears And Rain\\" and \\"Billy\\".  If you are fans of David Gray and Damien Rice, you will be enchanted with Back to Bedlam. <br /> <br />For more information about James Blunt, visit his website at [...]  <br /> <br />
B000BEZQ18|5.0|The movie Brokeback Mountain is Amazing and one of the best movie I've  seen, the soundtrack brings a complete perfection into the movie. All the hertfelt melody is here. A Classic and must own.. <br />5 stars
0446608955|5.0|I read the book A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks.  Landon Carter is you average teenage boy.  He's into girls, drinks, and pulls pranks.  Jamie Sullivan isn't your average girl.  First of all she is the preacher's daughter.  She is always nice, cheerful and helps anyone in need.  She especially likes visiting and taking care of the orphans.  Prom is coming up and Landon doesn't have a date and all the \\"hot\\" girls are taken.  He desperately needs a date, so he eventually decides to ask Jamie and she says yes.  One day she asks him to be in their annual Christmas play because she said that that year was to be exceptionally special.  Something is wrong though, but will she tell Landon before it's too late? <br /> I would recommend this book to teenage girls who like romance books.   <br /> I liked this book because a semi-popular guy falls in love, almost accidentally, with a girl that no one talks to. The best part was when they did the play.  I didn't like how kids didn't want to be Jamie's friend just because she was different. <br />
0553801503|2.0|This book compensates me for all the sleep I've lost over the previous, wonderful, books. It is a wonderful replacement for any sleeping pills you might need - dull, extremely slow and focuses on all the wrong (i.e. boring / annoying) characters.  <br /> <br />
B00004TJKI|5.0|The dark underbelly of Jimmy Stewart's aw-shucks screen image was rarely put to better use than in Otto Preminger's \\"Anatomy of a Murder.\\" If anyone could make a cunning defense attorney sympathetic, it's the man who made us like a voyeur in \\"Rear Window\\" and a borderline psychotic in \\"Vertigo.\\" In \\"Anatomy,\\" Stewart plays Paul Biegler, a fairly ordinary small-town lawyer who would just as soon fish and drink as ply his trade. However, when he falls into a high-profile murder case involving an Army lieutenant (Ben Gazzara) who has murdered a saloon owner for allegedly raping his wife (Lee Remick), a sharper, almost imperceptible edge emerges. Stewart is so lovable that we barely notice that he helps his client craft a rather insincere defense and uses his down-home persona to manipulate the audience and even the judge as he does battle with the \\"big city\\" prosecutors.    As with his best work for Hitchcock, we are suckers for Stewart's two-toned humanism: We delight in the contrast between his piano playing and good-natured interactions with an aging drinking buddy (Arthur O'Connell) and the consistently devious craftiness he displays in the courtroom. Not that there aren't many other reasons to like \\"Anatomy of a Murder.\\" The stellar cast, including George C. Scott and also real-life McCarthy nemesis Joseph N. Welch as the judge; a fabulous soundtrack by Duke Ellington, who makes a cameo appearance; the strategically leisurely pace of Preminger's direction; the evocative black and white cinematography; the memorable title sequence by Saul Bass. Ultimately, though, it's Stewart's show. Anyone who steps back and takes an objective look at the case and the judgment would be hard-pressed not to think that Stewart skirts justice, but we never really are objective. We root for him to do it the whole way.
B000099T2L|4.0|I actually do not own this cd, have heard a lot off it and I think Beyonce has a unique tone to her voice.  From a female perspective I am jealous cause she has a body that women crave for and men desire, all that and she can sing too.
B0000524CY|3.0|This movie is not scary, except for 1 scene (when Linda Blairs eyes roll back into her head. The movie is full of disturbing images and should not be watched alone at night by anyone under 18. I think that The Exorcist should be rated X. A good film about a 12 year old girl who is being possessed by a demon, and 2 catholic priests are called upon to try to save her. This movie should be rented, but never owned. It's just not worth it.
B0000009SF|4.0|One of the many things I loved about our late, lamented Frank was his unpredictable versatility. Just when you thought you had a handle on what he was doing, he released an album like \\"Lumpy Gravy\\", \\"Cruisin' With Ruben and the Jets\\", or this one.  <br /> <br />This is Zappa's jazz big band album and man, is it amazing! French horns, tubas and all kinds of brass pop out of the recording at you along with the usual \\"Abnuceals Emuukha Electronic Orchestra\\" type of approach.  <br /> <br />I saw this band (which featured jazzman George Duke)in Chicago and they were amazing, although Frank was bemoaning the fact that they were'nt much on the \\"crazy stage antics\\" side of the equation. I sure wish I could go back and relive that episode from the non-rock side of Zappa. <br /> <br />\\"Eat that question\\" and \\"For Calvin's Next Two Hitch-hikers\\" are top ten Zappa compositions, in my book.
B000DN5W4I|4.0|I've lost count on how many times I've seen the band preform. I received my DVD in the mail and quickly opened it up and threw it in the DVD player. The show is as I've seen it many times live, always great. I turned it up loud and I noticed after a while the volume gets softer and goes back up again ever so slowly. Just at the end of Blues Deluxe my DVD skipped to the next track. I'm not sure if it was an imperfection on the DVD or if it was my player. I'm going to play it in another DVD player to make sure. During the Yes medley it skipped forward to the next track again. I hope its not the disk and just my player needs a cleaning. Regardless, all Bonamassa fans should own this disk. If you're not a Bonamassa fan yet you will be when you watch this DVD.
0679422714|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book. The substance was thin at best. It was not what I was expecting. I thought there would be more detail on Mao's life.  A more pronounced understanding of the man and what drove him.  What was presented appeared to be no more than speculation. I really don't think that Mao's preoccupation with his bowel movements is overly relative, yet the author felt this was important enough to mention more than once. Just a very inept presentation of the story of a man with significant impact on world history.  I expected a lot better.
