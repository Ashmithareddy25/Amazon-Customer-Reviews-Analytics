B0014CQNTK|4.0|Just saw this film for the first time on DVD. I liked it a lot. I thought the performances were great from the supporting players like J.K Simmmons, Allison Janney, Olivia Thirlby, and the main characters of Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner were also very good. Ellen Page and Michael Cera are phenomenal in terms of their work Page getting more kudos obviously since the film is about her but Cera improves on crafting a good portrait of teen angst from Arrested Development to SuperBad to now Juno. Everyone knows the story Juno a spunky sixteen year old has sex with her track star best friend Paulie Bleeker (Cera) and becomes pregnant. Originally considering abortion she decides that she can't go through with it and settles on looking for couples hoping to adopt. She settles on the Lorings (Garner and Bateman) and decides that they are good and deserving people. The rest of the film is Juno adapting to being pregnant and trying to sort things out with Paulie who is obviously in love with her but she is not as quick to return his affections. Her dad and step mom (Simmons and Janney) are tough but loving of her and support her in whatever way they can. That was very refreshing to find in this movie that they don't make her feel ashamed and ridicule her on what a bad decision she has made. They initially voice their disapproval but ultimately take active stands in helping her get through this. Step mom tells off a snooty ultrasound technician who is quick to lump Juno into a class of irresponsible teenagers who find themselves pregnant, and Dad goes with her to meet the Lorings so that she won't be taken advantage of. Dad is also instrumental in helping Juno discover how she really feels about Paulie and giving her that needed advice that lets her know how she should tell Paulie. The subplot with Mark Loring and Juno did raise several questions for me as it did for other critics and reviewers. I know that in interviews writer Diablo Cody is very defensive about whether Mark is or isn't getting too close to Juno.  This was one big part of the script that I had a problem with. Not all of Cody's cool dialogue works but enough of it does and even for people who are miffed that her dialogue has been praised and singled out since the film opened in December the performances of Page and everyone else involved bring the realism and real emotion to the film that the dialogue takes away from. It's a great film with some great dialogue, brilliant acting from everyone involved, and a cool soundtrack. With all that being said Juno has been the most talked about film long before it even opened in theaters generating such buzz at film festival screenings. Diablo Cody has become a legend in the press who constantly point out her stripper and phone sex operator jobs which she worked at while penning this script. My point is that it is a film that is sure to disappoint some or annoy some just in terms of its hype. I have just finished reading Peter Travers review of the film on DVD and I think it is extremely true and indicative of the reactions to the film. Travers was championing the film when it opened theatrically and by the time Oscar noms came in he was commenting that the new found praise was starting a backlash against the film. He still sided with the film even then and didn't give in to the skeptics. The DVD release did rile him however and I agree. He maintains that the film is no longer the little indie that could but a Hollywood product based on the fact that you have to pay extra just to get featurettes that detail Cody and the cast and the packaging. I agree with that it sucks that you have to pay an additional six dollars just to get a little more than a half hours worth of featurettes. The single disc has plenty of good extras like commentary, deleted scenes, gag reels, auditions and so forth. Much like her working days you have to shell out to see Cody and I admit I did pay the extra six so I could view the nine minute featurette Diablo Cody is Totally Boss. Either way I like the film and I like Cody so the double disc was worth it but the single disc is also a very good deal for all the extras you get with it.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|You're probably asking, \\"why is a metalhead reviewing this?\\" Yes, I am a metalhead, but that doesn't mean I can't like a few rock bands. I just wanted to review it simply because like other reviewers, I'm wondering why there's no explicit version for this? It's just a couple of words, what's the point of it? The band's first album has the PA logo (that's Parental Advisory if you didn't know), but it's mainly for 1 song. You listen to their new album (which also has the PA logo), you're actually gonna hear a couple of songs that warrant the PA. In a way, I feel cheated, but not really. I usually pay attention to things like this before I buy music, but in this case, it couldn't be avoided. Hopefully, if you're somebody like me, you'll find out about it by reading online rather than buying it first and finding out the hard way. I almost cringe a little bit when I listen to No Surprise as Tyler sings \\"That all this lying gets to me, and no one seems to give a....(insert expletive here....without actually hearing it that is). If somebody can give a more clarified explanation as to why Roadrunner decided on doing this, it would be greatly appreciated. As far as the music, it's great. Their debut is also great, but Gasoline is a big step. The song writing has definitely gotten better, their first album seemed kinda rushed. Kinda flawed, but not extremely. This is my favorite that they've done so far. Also check out Scars & Souvenirs if you like this album.

B000IOM1YG|3.0|After \\"I Robot\\" I had high, high hopes for the Alan Parson Project.  But whimsy is not a theme that works well with them.  \\"The Mayan panoramas on my pyramid pajamas haven't helped my little problem\\"?  The title track?  Please.  This is not what APP is all about.  It's great that one of the other reviewers liked those lines, but let's face it, the lyrics are just plain silly.  The singing was done in almost a Bee-Gees falsetto that was annoying, and topping off the problems with the title track is a bridge that seems almost randomly thrown together.  APP is capable of composing fantastic bridges, e.g., Silence and I, but in Pryamid it's just jarring and clumsy.<br /><br />Thematically too, the album has wild variances.  Death and God feature prominantly on the A side* but then disappear with a shortened B side, which has no coherence of its own.  The album is saved by the two instrumentals (In the Lap of the Gods and Hyper-Gamma-Spaces) which are as good as APP has ever produced, as well as \\"Shadow of a Lonely Man,\\" a wonderfully composed song with pop appeal but that doesn't engage in pop pandering.  I have the old album, so maybe the bonus tracks also add something to the CD.<br /><br />Look, I'm not saying the album's not worth the price, or a listen.  It is.  It's no \\"Sicilian Defense.\\"  It's just not up to APP's very high standards of theme, coherence and instruments.<br /><br />*  For those too young to remember vinyl, that means the first five tracks on the CD or the first five downloads on your MP3 player.
0671879448|1.0|Not one example of anybody doing anything. A bunch of general statements saying do this and do that. Saying THINK CREATIVELY for example is a great idea but how about the name of someone who did it and what resulted.<br />A book like Dale Carnegie gives principles and ideas backed by peoples names and the results of their actions.
B000002VCO|5.0|This is probably APP's most underappreciated album, even though back in 1984 \\"Don't Answer Me\\" was a top-40 hit, and the album enjoyed some commercial success with that song and with \\"You Don't Believe.\\"<br /><br />The usual APP themes of alienation, disbelief and loss play varying roles in most of the songs.  Production values are, as usual, impeccable, and the instrumentation imparts a silken, surreal feel.  This is a great album to play at night, when you're by yourself studying, or when you're with a person you care about and with whom you want to share some intimacy.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I joined a local gym where we are in a Military Style Boot Camp for 5 months.  I've been there for 4 weeks and haven't see much difference in either my weight or strength.  I decided to dial it up some and purchased Jillian's 30 Day Shred DVD and let me just say, this will get your heart rate going!  In just 20 minutes, I was sweating more than in the boot camp class which is saying a lot since the trainers are official Military Service men, they have no mercy.  Jillian could teach these trainers a thing or two, that's for sure!!  I love/hate this DVD.  I love it because I know I'm going to see results FAST but I hate it because it's sooooo hard, even level one is a killer especially for the ones just starting out in the fitness world.<br />I plan on sticking with this and doing it everyday just to see if I can shed 20 pounds in 30 days like the cover says.  My eating is based on the boot camp recommendations which is a lot like Bill Philips Body For Life.  Low carbs, low fat & high protein meals.<br />Overall, I would give this DVD 10 stars if possible.  I feel like it will be more beneficial to me than the boot camp which is costing me $350.00 per month for 5 months!<br />Get this DVD and don't just stare at it for a week like I did.  Put it in the player and watch it though one time then attempt to do level 1. If you can't finish it or have to take breaks, that's fine but push yourself to your max.  Jillian says not to \\"phone it in\\" on these workouts and she's right.  You have to want to change your body in order to get through the entire 20 minutes.  It becomes a mental game after a while into these workouts.  But, it's really rewarding to finish it and know that each time I will be getting stronger and stronger.<br />Good Luck to those on the same path to wellness as I am on.  It's a road less traveled in this diet crazy world but so much quicker and healthier than the alternatives out there.<br />Thanks Jillian for the killer workouts.  I'm off to purchase your book now to get your advice about the nutrition part.  I'm sure it's full of ideas that will help me even more to reach my 40 pound weight loss goal!get your advice about the nutrition part.  I'm sure it's full of ideas that will help me even more to reach my 40 pound weight loss goal!
0143038419|1.0|I finished this book only because it was chosen for my book club. It took everything I had to actually finish this piece. I hated this book, and hated myself for wasting time on it that could actually be used to read something of quality. This author is probably the most self-centered, egotistical, whiny person I have ever encountered - either on paper or in person. All she talks about regarding Italy - is food? And India and Indonesia, no insight into the suffering or poverty the people encounter in their daily lives - just getting by. On page 153 (paperback edition) the author states \\"My sister had a friend who used to think that Catherine had two or three younger sisters, because she was always hearing stories about the sister who was in Africa, the sister who was working on a ranch in Wyoming, the sister who was the bartender in New York, the sister who was writing a book...\\"  Gag me. Could she be anymore in love with herself? If enlightenment was what she was seeking...why didn't she try a true service project to help others? Okay, so she got her rich American friends to donate some money to help someone buy some land. Heavy. This author mentioned nothing about how seeing other people struggle made her realize how fortunate she is that she is educated, American, healthy, has a loving family, money and actually gets to TRAVEL for a living. It appears as though she gained nothing from her year of travel. SHALLOW.
B00003CX8N|5.0|This is a great heart-warming film powered by two terrific actors. While this is a wonderful film regardless, if you are a book lover (as I am) this is even more of a treat. The basic story is about a New York woman who, irritated with the lack of quality books in her area, seeks out a bookseller in London to provide what she is looking for. While her personality and the personality of the bookseller are about as opposite as you can get, they become long distance friends.<br /><br />Hopkins and Bancroft  are both very good, and this truly is a feel good movie. While the premise may seem a bit boring, if you like movies that study human nature instead of just providing excitement and action, this is for you. You really start to get into the characters to the point that you feel the anticipation of meeting them yourself. To me, that is the definition of a well-done movie and good acting.<br /><br />Get yourself a bowl of popcorn for this one!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I loved this movie, it was a fast, loud, heart-racing experience in the theather, i have to admit that i became dizzy for a while, but the movie was so intense that i did not care    From beginning to end i loved it, whether the characters were in the party, or in the subway, or running through the streets, i tought it was spectacular.    Most people complain about the camera movement (if you saw at least one preview you knew what kind of film you were getting, so i dont know why people became so upset about it)    Second, most people complained about not explaining much of the monster, The movie is not about the monster, is about the people surviving the arrival of the monster, honestly, how many explanations can there be about the existence of a monster, havent we heard them all?... and i have to agree with the director, nothing is more scary than the unknown....    Anyway the movie is great, you should check the viral sites, and i cant wait for a sequel.

One additional request that I would make of Martha is to create some recipes for special diets like diabetics or vegans. Otherwise - my favorite cook book on the shelf.

0812550706|5.0|When I heard that a fantasy, strategic military, sci-fi book was finally added to our reading list of books, I knew that it would be my first choice for an excellent read. The book Ender's Game did not disappoint. Orson Scott Card spins an epic tale of tragedy, victory, and conquest that has something in it for everyone no matter what age. Ender's Game also sends a wonderful message that we can all relate to. Orson Scott Card's message, I believe, is to never judge a book by its cover. Ender, who is only 12, saves humanity and has as much, if not more, maturity and intelligence than any adult on earth. This book is remarkably thought provoking with twisted turns in every direction, which makes this book highly unpredictable and therefore that much more fun to read. Ender's Game is a real page-turner. Beware, do not start this book at night, as you will receive diseases of extreme insomnia or sleep deprivation.<br />With a beguiling plot and endless amount of captivating scenarios, Orson Scott Card will grasp your attention in the beginning as Ender begins his first steps to his extraordinary life with the ultimate removal of his monitor implanted in the back of his head. As the tale enfolds, Ender is quickly swept up to battle school as he exceeds in everything, making friends wherever he goes. Ender swiftly becomes a star and a role model for every student in battle school. Back on earth in a brother and sister feud between Ender's beloved sister Valentine and his distrusted brother Peter, they also change the world in their own unique way, using pseudonyms and ingeniously stopping the war that was bound to break loose at any moment. In battle school, Ender soon becomes the best and colonel Graff sends him out, at age 12, to save the world from the vile buggers. Doubts soon subside regarding his age and skill after countless battles were won for the Galactic Army using a holographic simulator. Will Ender and his few chosen comrades are up for the battle of, literally, their lives? Ender's Game is waiting with that answer.

0756404746|5.0|I grabbed a copy of this at WASFEN the end of last month.  While I am a Sci-Fi and Fantasy fan I usually stick to darker fare in my reading habits.  I bought this book for 2 reasons...<br /><br />The first was because I had met the author at WASFEN the previous year when the book was fisrt released in hardcover and I was somewhat smitten with him (I have a tendency towards the odd ones) but did not have the cash for a hard cover copy (and I was not smitten with the original cover art).  This year I was gainfully employed with cash in hand and far prefer paperbacks (and the new cover art was far better)... Pat was kind enough to sign my copy.  I wonder if I can use a signature in some kind of binding???<br /><br />The second reason was that I was there with a bunch of my friends and co-workers and we decided that all of us would get the book and then discuss it.<br /><br />So... I grabbed my copy and had to finish reading the other three things I was in the middle of before I finally got to sit down with it last week.  As I mentioned... I usually enjoy much darker fare.  However, I have to say... this could get darker, only the next two books will tell.<br /><br />At any rate, I absolutely loved this book!  First novels are always a gamble, this work was a literary delight to behold.  The writing was smooth and flowed along like music.  It was hard to put down for the necessities of life... like sleep, work, food, etc..  I was enamoured with Kvothe from the moment I met him and I had to know everything there was to know.<br /><br />There are so many wonderful underpinnings and side notes that I was lost in the world being created around me.  Love, loss, poverty, humor, innocence, coming-of-age, good and evil, dragons and demons, gods and devils, life and death... I mean it has everything -- and that's just in book one!  I'm waiting with baited breath for the next chapter!  I believe it is supposed to be released this Spring - which would be anytime now - I certainly hope so!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy or sci-fi, even those who don't because I think it reaches so far beyond just those audiences.  Be sure to have an empty bladder, a full stomach and several uninterrupted hours because you're not going to want to stop until the last delicious page!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0756404746 The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, Day 1)]]ok to anyone who loves fantasy or sci-fi, even those who don't because I think it reaches so far beyond just those audiences.

B00151HZME|5.0|M83's Anthony Gonzalez has always embraced the epic nature of his songs. When browsing through his catalog of amazing songs, you start to realize that his best are always the ones that build into grand displays of what electronic music can be with the right person behind the synth keys. On, Saturdays=Youth, Gonzalez is expanding this idea by introducing an increased importance placed on songwriting and pop sensibilities. The album is, by all accounts, a new wave album in the purest sense of the genre. Recalling the best work of groups like New Order, Flock of Seagulls, or Depeche Mode, Gonzalez has created what could possibly be his most impressive album to date.<br /><br />Saturdays=Youth plays out like the long-lost soundtrack to a John Hughes movie (actually cited by Anthony as an inspiration for the album), or a bonus CD for Donnie Darko. The scene pictured on the album cover should back me up on this. Gonzalez does more than just capture the mood of the cinematic era, however. The majority of the lyrics on the album are just as lovingly cheesy and melodramatic as can be, filled with such poignantly bad lines like \\"7am/dusty road/I'm going to drive until it burns my bones\\" or \\"The cemetary is my home/I want to be a part of it/invisible even to the night/and I'll read poetry to the stars.\\" But these awesomely bad lines hardly distract from the mood of the album; if anything, they enhance it! It's like watching Sixteen Candles all over again!<br /><br />That's not to say that you had to be around in the 80s to enjoy this though. I'm too young to remember anything from that era, and everything I know about it is second hand (Anthony, himself, is only 26). Still, I've found Saturdays=Youth to be an enchanting album. In the past, M83 has been about these really deep synth-heavy songs that build and build and assault your eardrums with pure electronic bliss. This album is a much softer, spread-out experience. There's never a sound that is too harsh or commanding, despite the fact that every song is built upon several layers of different synthetic instruments. Album opener, \\"You, Appearing,\\" for example, never ventures beyond a simple piano line and atmospheric synth harmonies.<br /><br />\\"Kim & Jessie,\\" meanwhile, starts out of the gate with heavy drums and a blast-from-the-past synth lead that should totally be the intro song to some 80s throwback film, like Tears for Fears' \\"Head Over Heals\\" on the aforementioned Donnie Darko. \\"Skin of the Night\\" is a brilliantly sexy tune with shrill female vocals. She sings, \\"She digs her nails into her naked chest/miles of veins fan out like a road map/she pulls back the skin to show her ribs/that twinkle like shooting stars.\\" It's pretty decent \\"mood\\" music for anyone who happens to still be living in 1985. \\"Graveyard Girl\\" replaces a lot of the keyboards for guitars, and the overall feel is unlike anything else the album has to offer. Gonzalez does manage to throw in some vocal synths, however; you know, the choral sounds on a keyboard that never get used? To be able to make them sound cool, to me, is a great sign of talent.<br /><br />Possibly the greatest thing about Saturdays=Youth is that everything feels familiar despite the fact that this is all original material. There are not very many artists out there today who share Anthony's love for 80s new wave music and bring that love out in their music; so being able to hear a fairly stellar recreation of it is entirely welcomed. It should go without saying that many M83 fans may feel disenfranchised with the new approach that Gonzalez is taking to creating music. There are only a few moments on the album that sound like they could've been on another one of his works. \\"Couleurs,\\" is clearly one of them, as is \\"Dark Moves of Love.\\" Beyond that, however, this is completely new territory; both for Gonzalez and his fans. Personally, though I enjoyed his past albums almost without exception, Saturdays=Youth seems like the culmination of his work; an album that will not die out after a handful of listens, but one that will continue to receive plays for years. New wave is not my favorite of genres, to be honest, but this is an album that I simply cannot get enough of!

B000002GK1|5.0|When the year 1991 hit, grunge music exploded onto the mainstream with Nirvana's Nevermind, creating a brand new genre of rock music for youth to rock out to and relate to. Pearl Jam released its debut Ten, which also had everyone buzzing about the sudden popularity of these once underground rock bands. But what is forgotten about is Soundgarden and their smash record, Badmotorfinger. This album in my opinion is the most sophisticated, multi-layered piece of rock music in the grunge catalog, and maybe even rock music in general. Although Nevermind and Ten are superb albums, Soundgarden seems to explore another set of elements that none of the other major grunge groups ever encountered. This Seattle band made itself a major player on the music scene from then on as this dense, complex yet rocking album made Soundgarden into one outstanding band.

1594489505|1.0|I view the book as a manipulative political tool designed to substantiate the United States's occupation in Afghanistan. After devoting a large portion of the novel to the tyranny experienced under Russia, the Taleban, and the waring tribes, Hosseini chooses not to elaborate on the latest invaders, the United States. When Laila turns to Taliq and states she wants to return to her country, the book plunges into fantasy land, not unlike Dorothy clicking her heels three times and saying 'there's no place like home\\".  Hosseini is lauded and praised by a culture that chooses to remain ignorant of our actions in a foreign land. He is no different than any other 'artist' who tows the line of a regime to perpetuate their myth. The irony being, of course, that we are a society shrouded in the berka and thoroughly at peace with the perspective through our little lace window.  Hosseini is no literary star, simply another political puppet in a sad chapter.    jean latka, Pueblo, Colorado

According to the authors, my tastes run to the \\"cheap and trashy\\", but that's okay.  There are a lot of the cheap and trashy fragrances that I don't like at all which just brings home the fact that fragrance is all a matter of opinion and one's particular nose.    Although there are reviews of some fragrances that have been discontinued, many have just been ignored and I do wish my favorite fragrances (Balahe - still around, Ambre Oliban - still around, Diva - discontinued, Bora Bora - still around) had been reviewed.  Maybe they were too cheap and trashy.    If you're at all interested in fragrances I would definitely recommend purchasing this book.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I purchased these for my sister (Lost - the first 3 seasons) as she had lost all her tapes where she taped each episode on a VCR.  She loved the LOST episodes that I purchased at the same time and was estatic to get these 3 episodes!
0783225482|3.0|A hilarious comedy that rests entirely on the shoulders of its stars; Meryl Streep is superb (when is she not?) and is matched in intensity and humour by Goldie Hawn. Bruce Willis is really great in his turn as a comedic actor. this is not a masterpiece by any means but it is a fun and a funny movie to watch nevertheless.

B000002P5R|4.0|Ever since Jimi's untimely death in September 1970 people have debated over what exactly his last album would have sounded like had he lived to finish it.  Several posthumous releases have attempted to put this issue to rest.  The official \\"First Rays Of The New Rising Sun\\" is the best attempt to date.  However, it could have been a lot more comprehensive and true to Jimi's vision.        As noted by previous reviews, the producers should have considered Jimi's own handwritten notes.  He left pretty detailed instructions about the title to use, songs to include, cover art and even the running order.  Unfortunately, most of this was disregarded by Experience Hendrix/MCA.      For details on Jimi's wishes for his fourth studio album read the article on Wikipedia on First Rays or the book \\"Black Gold\\" by Steven Robey.      If I could take over Experience Hendrix for a day, I'd issue a 2CD set  called \\"People Hell and Angels\\" and include the majority of actual  songs (not jams) that Jimi recorded for his planned triple album. Anything from May 1969 to his late sessions in August 1970.  I would have used the cover art Jimi drew up in the summer before his  death. Without a doubt, Jimi probably would have changed his mind about what he wanted on his next album.  But Jimi's handwritten ideas are better than the guess work that's been going on since 1970.      Here's my version of a 2 disc version of First Rays Of The New Rising  Sun. All of the songs are included on the official First Rays except  where noted.  Maybe EH will reissue the album as a deluxe edition and include more of these tracks.      DISC ONE  1. Dolly Dagger  2. Night Bird Flying  3. Room Full Of Mirrors  4. Belly Button Window  5. Freedom  6. Ezy Ryder  7. Astro Man  8. Drifting  9. Straight Ahead  10. Drifter's Escape (from South Saturn Delta)  11. Come Down Hard On Me (from the JHE box set)  12. Beginnings  13. Cherokee Mist (from the JHE box set)  14. Angel  15. Stepping Stone  16. Izabella  17. HearMy Train A Comin' (the outstanding May 1969 Band of Gypsys version. An outtake from the :Blues album)    DISC TWO  1. Bleeding Heart (from South Saturn Delta)  2. Earth Blues Today  3. Country Blues (from the JHE box set)  4. Midnight Lightning (from South Saturn Delta)  5. Burning Desire (edited version of Baggy's Rehearsal studios 1st take)  6. Valleys Of Neptune (Heard on Lifelines but unavailable commercially)  7. Heaven Has No Tomorrow (Heard on Lifelines but unavailable commercially)  8. Sending My Love (Heard on Lifelines but unavailable commercially)  9. Pali Gap (from South Saturn Delta)  10. Hey baby (New Rising Sun)  11. Message To Love (from the JHE box set)  12. Power of Soul (from South Saturn Delta)  13. Once I Had A Woman (from :Blues)  14. Bolero (cool instrumental.  Unavailable commercially)  15. In From The Storm    My version would feature 2 1/2 hours of music. If 2Pac can put out a  2CD posthumous studio album so can Jimi! And I'm sure people would buy  it.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This was the first PINK FLOYD video that i have ever bought after<br />being a PINK FLOYD fan for a lot of years and i AM glad that i did.<br />I love the production both with the music and the visuals.<br />Dave has the ever popular back up girls, lasers and screaming strat<br />sound as he always had.<br />It is refreshing to see a great musician that has never lost it with his talent.<br />This dvd is packed with great songs and extra footage with New-<br />5.1 surround.

0385507755|5.0|Quite frankly, if this isn't a true story and is marketed as one, that's pretty crappy.  However, this book grabbed my attention fast and didn't let go.  I would read it at stoplights, on my lunch break, etc.  I couldn't put it down and I read it in just a few days.  In my opinion a good book is a book that holds your attention, is easy to follow, makes you laugh, makes you cry and is overall entertaining.  This book did all of those things, as well as the sequel, My Friend Leonard.  I LOVE both of them and would recommend them to anyone.
B000784WMW|5.0|I watched every Jane Eyre adaptation and this is number one for me. T. Dalton is too handsome for the role. Let's face it women would buy movie and watch it over and over just to glance at him. Same scenes with less attractive actor wouldn't produce the same effect. He is not just a pretty face but tremendous acting ability and magnetism. I like everybody in this movie. It is very true to book. I like the dramatization. When at the end he asked her to leave, because he thought that she wanted to stay with him only out of pity, it is so hearbreaking. It is an opposite of the time when he begged her to stay. I also like scenes: Mr.Rochestor with Briggs asking his help in finding Jane and Jane with Briggs worrying about Rochester. I would remove lines where she called him \\"not handsome\\", since they choose a handsome actor.  I suprised that people called production outdated. According to the book, house should be in a bad shape, since Rochestor hardly leave there. I personally enjoy actors work not environment or special effect.
B00005JMJG|4.0|I think that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a remarkable film because of the original story of Charlie Kaufman and the increasing talent of the young Michel Gondry. A picture to see minimum once in a cinema life.
B0013FXWU6|2.0|Well, I post a lot of movie reviews, and it seems I usually only post when I DON'T like a film.  I truly care about which pictures are nominated, and usually a nomination alone will get me to want to see a movie.  Wow, I am so confused and disappointed.      I just watched There Will Be Blood last night.  I will say ONE good thing about this film, and this is solely my basis for giving it 2 stars: Daniel Day-Lewis DID deserve the Oscar.  His acting and portrayal of a businessman sinking into his own madness and greed was spot-on.  I think he has a face that makes you pay attention, and you want to hang onto ever word.  I also just really like him, so maybe I'm biased.      HOWEVER..........      This movie was LONG, BORING, TEDIOUS, AND REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A PLOT.  Look, I'm not saying \\"good\\" movies need a ton of action and need to spoon-feed you, but this movie really left you saying, \\"When WILL something happen to grab my attention?\\"  I completely understand that this was written as a character study - where watching and analyzing his movements, choices, and mannerisms was the key to truly appreciating the story.  THIS is why I thought he was remarkable - because he DID show the character he needed to.  I can also see the parallels between him and Eli Sunday, but I didn't think Eli was in it enough (God, it WAS almost 3 hours long, people!) to truly show the fall of both men into madness.  Not until the end (and I won't ruin it) did the director slap the parallel in your face.      Ok, speaking of endings, I am pretty picky about endings.  I hated No Country For Old Men, and thought the absurd ending only made me hate it more.  The ending for There Will Be Blood, in my opinion, was actually quite entertaining albeit nerve-wrecking.  I quite enjoyed the ending, but it wasn't enough for the film to win me over.      Another side note for people who have seen it:  What was the deal with the son?  I \\"get it\\", and I do think he loved his son, but that was pretty disappointing what happened between the two of them.      At any rate, I can completely see why the Academy nominated it: It's sweeping, cinematic, epic...all of these things the Academy seems to love.  But was it good?  I don't think so...
B00154GEFU|5.0|After waiting 25 years for the 4 original members of ASIA to release a new album, I am so pleased with this released.  They have not abandoned the sound that got them the popularity they achieved many years ago and have kept many listening all through the years.  I think the band sounds much better now than they did back then.  Better equipment, and more time to practice makes for a perfect album.  you will not be disappointed.  Go buy this album asap and listen to it.  I cannot stop listening.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|i love this movie.  it's timeless :)  it's about a guy who wakes up every morning to find it is the same day ... though he is the only one affected. he plays around with it at first, but then gets really depressed by it.  He doesn't get to move on until he, basically, changes who he is within and without.  lots of laughs, but also a pretty good message :)
B00102FELM|4.0|I waited a while before buying this DVD. I always liked the Scorpions, and this is a real cool show with Uli Roth and Michael Schenkner joing the band. Definetly worth buying.
0385338082|5.0|This was SUCH a cute book. I could not put it down. The writing is extremely clever and I laughed out loud a few times. I really would love to see this book turned into a movie. I'd cast Isla Fisher and Patrick Dempsey.
B000PFU7OO|2.0|Only one or two good songs.  Wish I would have just downloaded them from iTunes!
B00000F214|4.0|I feel like they swore so much more in the mid-90's.  Maybe I'm just getting old but every other line of this movie was f*ck, it seemed.  So that kind of turned me off of the movie.  However, on the hole this movie was good, good action, good plot and good mystery.  Kevin Spacey did a great job with his role, it was a lot like his role in Seven.  Kind of the relaxed sociopath with sarcastic humor.      On Blue ray-HD the movie looked great, I watched it on a PS3 while sick one afternoon and it took my mind off of the stomach flu.  And if thats not a great movie I don't know what is.
0316010669|2.0|This book could probably be anywhere from a 1/3rd to a 1/4th as big as it is; if not a pamphlet. Maybe the 2d star I gave it is too altruistic. But I will credit it with a few good points.  For what it purports to write about, it's WAY WAY too heavily larded down with minutiae and details to the point of the reader starting to doze off, break concentration from Gladwell's aggregate point, or both. Gladwell really needs to take a course on/in brevity.  As much as I tried to give it a chance in spite of what the coverflap said of who the author's written for, I can understand why he writes for them and why they hired him.  Definitely near the bottom of my list of recommends.
B000683VI4|5.0|Ok, I will write this review despite the fact that probably noone will read it.  This is my all time favorite movie. Why? Because it never gets boring to watch. Yes I am a chick. Yes, this is a chick movie. But, guys like it too, even though they won't admit it. My very manly husband has watched this with me 2x, and CRIED both times. Don't let that scare you off, especially the guys. It is absolutely one of the best love stories ever ever ever put to film. Never cheesy, despite other reviews. It tells the story of two young adults finding love for perhaps the first time. If that isn't universal, I don't know what is. The satisfaction of seeing them finally end up together is so gratifying.  The kiss in the rain (as shown on the cover of the movie) is worth watching all by itself. Yes I am a hopeless romantic. Deep down, who isn't?  EVERYONE should see this movie. Then you will know why it is so beloved. If i could give it 10 stars I would.
B00154GEFU|4.0|An excellent CD from start to finish. From the kickstart rocker \\"Never Again\\" to the powerful anthem, and my personal fave, \\"An Extraordinary Life,\\" Asia has returned with a solid effort. A little something for everyone who appreciated their first two - and only two - albums with this lineup. If you haven't seen them in concert since they reunited, try to catch them on tour. Incredible musicians at the top of their game.<br /><br />Welcome back John, Geoff, Carl and Steve. It's been FAR too long!<br /><br />OK, time to slap the headphones on again and crank up \\"Phoenix\\" for another listen...
B000001FI7|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said in other reviews? Well, for me this is the one essential trip-hop album. But it goes way beyond being a very successful pop or trip-hop disc. What Portishead established with Dummy was the recognition of the diverse musical roots of the trip-hop movement, filtered through an intensely modernistic lens. Out in 1994, it sounds like it was released yesterday.<br /><br />Let's briefly analyze \\"Glory Box,\\" likely the most well-known track from this pervasively known disc. Glory Box begins with that unmistakeable descending bass line, which basically has the same resonance to 25-40 year olds that John Coltrane's \\"Tunji\\" or \\"Equinox\\" did to the baby Boomer generation. A repeating series of chords in F sharp, Glory Box is a gutbucket blues tune transposed to Gen X values, dripping with film noir nightclub atmosphere, the type of song that could be successfully played for any age group from Greatest Generation to Silent Generation, to Baby Boom to millennials. This song has that kind of universality. It's also a great instrumental blowing tune.<br /><br />Moving on to another harmonically interesting tune, \\"Roads\\" has even more of the old jazz feel, with a roomy series of chord progressions in F Major. You can imagine an orchid in Beth Gibbons' hair as she sings the bridge. On this track and on this disc, Adrian Maben makes extremely tasteful use of the oft-abused wah pedal, and proves to be Gibbon's ideal running mate in this classic album.<br /><br />It Could Be Sweet is an adult lullaby. Deeply felt and deeply moving.<br /><br />The emotional range on this disc is significant. Not every song on Dummy is a gutwrenching heartbreaker, and they don't need to be. Tunes like \\"Wandering Star\\" and \\"Mysterons\\" are soundtracks to Gen X urban life with a measure of humor and dry observation. The entire disc is unmistakeable and as cohesive as Dark Side of the Moon was to an earlier generation. Like DSOTM (but not in sales), Dummy is a law unto itself and an inescapable disc of its times.<br /><br />There's so much more I could say. Sitting through and learning some of these tunes by ear gave me a whole new appreciation for what Gibbons et. al. did on this disc. Some of the stuff on here stands up to anything written in the last 60-70 years or more. If there's one album to buy to represent the 90's, for me this would be the one, without hesitation.<br /><br />And finally, after 14 years, Portishead will release another album! Astonishing.its times.    There's so much more I could say. Sitting through and learning some of these tunes by ear gave me a whole new appreciation for what Gibbons et. al. did on this disc.

0780622553|5.0|This movie is my second favorite sci-fi movie. It's orignality is sure to keep the viewer's interest. Also it stars Kiefer Sutherland. He puts on a very strong acting role, one of his best. The movie presents a scary phenomenon in which Strangers are able to stop time at 12 am. While time is stop they re-arrange people and give them new identities. People wake up not realizing who they are or who they were yesterday. However, one man is still able to move while time is stopped. There is an icredible one one one confrontational battle where each person is using mental powers in attempt to destroy the other (similar to the force in Star Wars). However, the plot thickens as you learn about what the Strangers are really up to. Oh, did I mention that the Strangers are aliens?
B000P12LWY|1.0|I was so excited to see this show after watching the first episode online months before the DVD was released.  When I got the first season from the library I was over-the-moon excited to watch all the episodes.  I began watching the first episode, & I was revolted to see how much sex and nudity there was.  I'm an 18 year old girl, I love shirtless guys, but I don't love naked guys.  It could've been such a good show, if there wasn't so much sex.  It's just wrong! If there wasn't so much nudity, I'd surely give this show 5 stars, but that totally ruined it for me, & I never finished watching the first episode.  Thumbs down from me.
B000M341QE|1.0|The plot of the movie was fair but Jack Nicholson's role was a bit disappointing. As far as I am concerned Nicholson always portrays evil characters or mentally ill individuals. He is one of the best actors. That is one reason I wanted to see this movie. I also like Matt Damon. However, Nicholson's role was awful once you find out the true reason why Nicholson was a drug ring leader.     Also some of the plot appeared rush. Everything occurred in spurts, especially the ending. The ending felt very rushed, without giving anything away. There was a lot of action here and there but in between I felt like pressing forward.     Finally, this movie is almost unwatchable due to the language. Directors use the excuse that they \\"want to depict how society really is\\" so they involve a lot of cursing and vulgar sexual comments. However, this is very exaggerated. Every other word involves the F word or a part of an individuals genitalia. This is one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold's Waking the Fallen is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  I am a fan of all types of rock music, and this is among the best of all genres!  A7X truly made such huge strides from Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, (which I also love) to this album.  While Sounding the Seventh Trumpet was more of a hardcore/screamo album, this album is much more of a metal/alternative album, in my opinion, although as the editor's review said, \\"A7X blur the line between punk and metal.\\"  They are definitely a hard band to categorize.  For a strong punk influence check out Second Heartbeat and Eternal Rest.  For straight up metal songs check out Reminissions, Radiant Eclipse, and I Won't See You Tonight Pt. 2.  For incredibly melodic songs check out I Wont See You Tonight Pt. 1, Unholy Confessions, and Clairvoyant Disease.  And lastly, for great songs, check out every track on the album, seriously!  This album will make you get angry, happy, sad, depressed, pumped up, basically the full range of emotions.  It is just perfect.  Every track is simply amazing.  The musicianship is exceptional, the lyrics are exceptional, and the vocals are exceptional.  This was the pinnacle of M. Shadows voice for me because his melodic vocals were a bit better back in those days, and he was actually screaming (and screaming great)!  A7X has been missing something ever since Shadows stopped screaming, though I still like their newer albums!  The Rev is also one of the best drummers around today!  Synester Gates gets all the credit all the time, but Zacky is also a great guitarist.  Synester cranks out the solos and cool leads, while Zacky cranks out the heavy riffs.  And Johnny Christ is a hell of a bass player (not as good as their former bass player though), he's even better on City Of Evil, though.  The album is probably impossible for A7X to top because it is so flawless.  If you are a fan of punk, metal, hardcore, emo, screamo, alternative, or just basic rock you should definitely pick this incredible album up.  If you don't like screaming vocals you might want to stay away from this because the album is basically half singing half screaming, but with more emphasis on screaming!  I promise you, you will not be disappointed!  This is a true 5 star album.  *****ely pick this incredible album up.  If you don't like screaming vocals you might want to stay away from this because the album is basically half singing half screaming, but with more emphasis on screaming!

B00023B1LC|4.0|The Bourne Identity is a superb action movie. The plot was well thought out and it keeps the viewer guessing what is going to happen next. Meanwhile, Matt Damon (as Jason Bourne) has no clue what is going on. All he knows is that people are trying to assassinate him. Towards the middle of the movie it became very intense. Bourne's agency sent out three agents to kill Bourne. At this point Bourne must combat these guys. Each guy is fought in a different way, separating this movie from the typical action movie. The first agent is fought through a stealth type mission out in an open field. Both agents crawl around the field, unaware where each other is. It seemed like Metal Gear to me. Next he fights another agent through a hand to hand combat followed by a straight shoot out.    This movie is a combination of action and drama. It is not a non-stop action thriller but yet is sure to keep your interest because you don't know what is going to happen next.

B000EDWKXI|4.0|This is an entertaining film, a light comedy of errors and mistaken identity, complimented by a talented cast, superb art direction and costume design.     The comical plot device of mistaken identity is ancient, showing up in the myths of the Greeks and Romans and Shakespeare's comedies. This film takes this strategy to the extremes with almost every leading character taking on the identity of other characters resulting in confusion and witty situational dialogue. Casanova takes on the identity of wealthy lard merchant Paprizzio so as to seduce Paprizzio's fiancé Francesca. Francesca takes on the identity of a fictional male philosopher of women's rights. Francesca's clumsy, love-sick brother Giovanni takes on the identity of Casanova. As the film continues the intended lovers find new and more compatible lovers while the evil agents of the Catholic Church, such as Bishop Pucci, are confounded by all the switches and reversals of fortune and plot.     The cast is superb and Health Ledger does a good job of playing Casanova. However he is surrounded by exceptional actors, many of whom steal every scene in which they are placed. Sienna Miller plays Francesca, an early feminist who resists Casanova's attentions. Jeremy Irons shows his comic talents as he overplays the villainous Bishop Pucci. However there were four actors who were exceptional. Lena Olin plays Andrea Bruni, the beautiful widow plotting to have her daughter married to a wealthy man. Oliver Platt plays Paprizzio the wealthy lard merchant, and he steals every scene he is in with his delivery of lines and facial expressions and physical presence. Omid Djalili is superb as Casanova's put upon man servant Lupo, constantly trying to cover-up all the switched identities and double dealings. Charlie Cox is very good as the goofy, clumsy younger brother Giovanni who grows from love sick puppy to legendary lover.     The sets and art direction are exceptional. The re-creation of Venice was outstanding with exceptional attention to the grandeur and architectural details that permeate the city. Costume design was excellent and sumptuous. The sound track was also excellent - containing the light energetic 18th century works for which Venice is known and which perfectly match this comedy.    Overall this is an entertaining film of light comedy, containing enough plot twists to keep your attention, finely acted especially by some of the secondary characters, and beautiful to watch.
1400034205|5.0|This book, recommended by a friend, was my first exposure to Maugham.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, as I find myself asking the questions (or perhaps looking for the questions) Larry, one of the main characters was asking.  While it was billed as a book about a man searching for purpose, truth, and meaning, it was only partially that.  Maugham juxtaposes the snob Elliot Templeton, contrasting their motives, yet comparing their actions in many respects also.     Having read \\"Siddartha\\" by Herman Hesse and \\"Into the Wild\\" by Jon Krakauer, I found \\"The Razor's Edge\\" to be very similar.  If you are a fan of the theme of a maverick youth looking for truth outside of comfortable society, then the \\"Razor's Edge\\" is for you.
B00154GEFU|5.0|So refreshing to be able to listen to music as it was meant to be recorded and packaged.  No wonder the first album did so well, talent shines once more.  No corporate control on this one. Substance abounds throughout!!  Yes it has it's catchy pop moments ala \\"Never Again\\" but this is the music that has so dearly been missing from all of our lives for far too long!!(does anyone remember Keyboard's)  Welcome back from the Ashes Asia!!
B000YABYLA|5.0|This movie is AWESOME!!! Saw it 7x in the theater. Great original music. Kind of quirky, but overall good. Has something for everyone. Juno, her Dad, Stepmom Brenda (the dog lover), 3 year old 1/2 sister LB, are hardworking honest and loving blue collar people. Juno finds Jennifer Gardner and Jason Bateman as the well-to-do adoptive parents in the \\"Pennysaver\\" ad with her hilariously honest, teacher-loving friend Leah. Jen Gardner is a perfectionist with the perfect home, and Jason still wants to rock out not sure of the whole dad thing. Juno first tries to abort, then sees classmate w/anti-abortion picket sign in front of clinic and that's when she decides to keep it. This movie deals with teenage pregnancy issues that are real. This is a MUST SEE!! You won't be disappointed.
0307265730|4.0|I agree with much of what is said in the glowing reviews of Lahiri's writing. However,  I must add that there is something a little false and contrived (and immensely irritating to me as an Indian) about the constant emphasis on name-brand schools and 'professional' status. I wonder if Lahiri is (temporarily, I hope) succumbing to the grandiosity that afflicts the self-appointed 'elite' of all cultures and nations.

B000DWMYQ8|4.0|Chicken Little is a good film. It is good mostly because it is short, and that's the truth. The film introduces the town and Chicken Little, proving he is nuts, with his \\"The Sky is Falling\\" claim. In a fun-loving twist of the wonderful tale from the Jataka Text, a collection of Indian-Buddhists writings, we learn that the sky, IS ACTUALLY falling...sort of. Chicken Little's widowed father slowly regains his faith in his child and the whole town realizes that there is a space invasion caused by panicked mother and father aliens who have lost their child(obvious, but sweet parental advice to be heard).  The film ends.      And so you have a wonderfully short and wonderfully sweet animation film. Yes, the pop references for parents do seem dated, but they aren't that bad. Surely, children will love this film; the slapstick is there, the cute characters, the decent animation (not too great, just decent) and the quickness of pace.    For their first CGI produced and distributed film, things look promising for Disney again.
0525950079|1.0|My wife and I had the audio book version for a road trip, and thank god that it was a long drive, or we never would have made it through this. All the characters were one dimensional, the plot was obvious AND meandering, and the setting isn't historically accurate or even plausible.<br /><br />Apparently, medieval times weren't so medieval: serfs and peasants were free to argue with their Lords, women were equals in the business place and guild halls, abortions were readily available, etc, etc. Anytime anyone gets miffed, they just trounce off to London, hire a lawyer, and take the matter to court. Follett pushes 21st Century sensibilities onto his characters, so we see feminism, democracy, etc, all way back in the middle ages. Even though the book is set around a Catholic Church (the reformation was over 100 years away), the priests and nuns are free to run things the way they want and put it to a vote amongst themselves if their bishop disagrees.<br /><br />The sex scenes were so gratuitous, puerile, and plentiful as to be comedic. I have no problem with sex in books, actually I rather like it, but this was just bad. Most amateur erotica is better written than any of this. A typical example is his use of the phrase \\"the delta of her sex,\\" which makes the reader wonder how Follett wrote this with a straight face.<br /><br />Also in doubt is whether or not this book was edited by anyone, let alone a professional. The prose is redundant and Follett insults the reader by explaining even the most trivial and obvious emotions and reactions in his character.<br /><br />Had I been reading the print version, I'm not sure I could have made it through the first hundred pages, let alone the seven hundred that this miserable tome drags on for. Historical fiction can be moving and informative when well done; World Without End is neither historical nor worthwhile.
B000002ILG|5.0|White Lion is a great band and I am glad they are releasing a new album. The songs Wait and When the Children Cry from this album are the greatest.
B0011NVC9I|1.0|I am very glad I bought this used. If it's awful, you didn't spend so much purchasing it. By the way the commercials were shown, I expected Angelina Jolie to be in most of this film. The characters looked like wooden figures, except for Grendel. I had a bit of difficulty understanding Grendel when he spoke to his mother. In the original epic, Grendel's mother is more beastly looking instead of a beautiful woman. It had its pretty messy moments, like Grendel tearing guys to pieces, and it had dull moments, like Beowulf and his young mistress. You pretty much had to guess that Hrothgar was with Grendel's mother and I wish they would have shown Beowulf's son in humanoid form before he was attacking in his serpent form. It was just terrible.
B0011KQSZ4|2.0|The movie has some pluses. The final eulogy was touching. The fiancee never giving up on her betrothed in spite of what her relatives thinks. However, the bad outweighs the good. The movie relies on drug humor, midget humor, and scatological humor for the gags. They don't even do it well. Cliches abound. The actors seem to be trying hard, but the script never delivers completely. The pacing seems to drag on certain scenes at times. It is definitely frenetic at other times.     In summary, perhaps if you were in the right mood, you might enjoy the movie, but there are many better farcical movies out there.
6305907145|4.0|We enjoyed watching this version of Mansfield Park, but prefer another version starring Jemma Redgrave.  Although all the actors were good in both, we found the one with Ms. Redgrave more entertaining.  Would still recommend it regardless!
B000003C2S|5.0|I quite like the production on this album.  It makes it a unique Death album.  A bit of advice:  if you are looking for a brand new remastered version of this album for about 15 bucks or less, look no further than Amazon!  United Kingdom, that is!  Go to the bottom of the page and follow the link...If you want the original mix, which also has its merits, then buy from the folks above.  When I can't find a metal CD on Amazon USA, I often check out Amazon United Kingdom.  Anyway, as for Spiritual Healing, it's great, but Human, Symbolic, Individual Thought Patterns, and especially Sound of Perserverence are quite a bit better.  I'd rank it their 5th best album.  And that doesn't mean it's bad!!  It's Death!!  It's excellent!!
0618918248|1.0|I would like to see a scientist disprove God's existence.  I would follow & adore anyone who can. Science actually works hand in hand with creation of the world by a Supreme Power.  What gets me is, let's just say evolution is real, it can only evolve back to the first item & then the   question has to be asked, where did that first item come from??!?  Have a wonderful day being scientific.    Try to disprove God, I invite you.  Then try to find out which religion is correct.?!  I will give you a hint, Roman Catholicism, I invite you to prove that wrong too,   by studying why all the other religions are false.  There is only one true religion in which it's leader dies out of love for all persons.  Even though not all persons will achieve it's rewards.
0375842209|4.0|This book took a hold of me and didn't let go until 500 pages later. I finished it in one sitting. What really make the book work are the characters. They present all sides of what is means to be human--both the positives we can accomplish and the negatives we can succumb to.    If I have one qualm with the book, it is its last line. Not very original.
B0010X745K|3.0|\\"The Mist\\", based on the novella by Stephen King, has a small group of people holed up inside a supermarket after an all-encompassing impenetrable vapor cloud rolls through the entire town.  It doesn't take long before a local man bursts through the doors in a blind panic, blood on his face and clothes and ranting about \\"something in the mist\\" that dragged his friend away.  From there we are led on a moderately-paced ride of suspense as strange and frightening creatures emerge from the fog, the death toll increases and the main characters make a last ditch effort at escape only to meet a fate worse than what awaits them outside the safe confines of the supermarket.<br /><br />For those that have been reading all the customer reviews (positive and negative alike), the ending has already been spoiled (and had it not been, I would've had no qualms about spoiling it myself - it's THAT BAD).<br /><br />Quite frankly, I think it speaks for itself.  Let me just say that it's like slapping down $40 for a great steak...and then getting food poisoning.  I did feel pretty sick to my stomach, steak or no steak, after watching the last ten minutes.  It's artistic license at its worst.<br /><br />I was also disappointed to see a talented director like Frank Darabont make a mockery of his previous efforts with an ending designed for maximum shock value.  Instead of giving the story the dignity that it deserves (and King actually SANCTIONED this new and horrific twist), Darabont instead has managed to churn out a movie capped by an outrageous denouement that has absolutely no artistic merit.  For fans of Darabont's previous work (Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile), be forewarned - you will have the distinct urge to turn the other cheek at his future releases.  Anyone can shock and/or surprise, but if they do so with proficiency and artistry, they are to be commended.  There is nothing commendable about what Darabont has done to rework one of Stephen King's best stories.  On paper, \\"The Mist\\" remains a masterpiece.  On film, it is a near disaster.<br /><br />Having gotten that out of the way, I feel should I point out the movie's strong suits.  The first is the design of the creatures that wander through the mist, especially the larger ones.  Two giants who make appearances first at a halfway point through the film then the other in the last fifteen minutes are quite a wonder of conceptual design.  The screenplay is also good but I do feel that some of the characters are extreme, the religious fanatic in particular played by Marcia Gay Harden.  Of course, every good story needs a good antagonist, someone whom the reader constantly wishes would receive their comeuppance.  To quote from another of Darabont's films (The Shawshank Redemption), \\"His Judgment cometh and that right soon.\\"<br /><br />Second is the wrenching performance of the film's lead actor Thomas Jane as the film's protagonist David Drayton.  Although I hated the ending, I thought Jane gave a commendable portrayal of a man tortured by his decision.  Also noteworthy is Nathan Gamble as David's son Billy - his performance was neither trite nor maudlin in the least.  Harden is a bit much with her fire-and-brimstone rhetoric as the sanctimonious Mrs. Carmody while the rest of the supporting cast blend in with one another.<br /><br />Bottom line: the film is excellent up until the last ten minutes.  Had a different ending been used and the \\"gotcha\\" ending (to quote another reviewer) became an alternative ending, I would've been much happier with it and would've even considered adding it to my collection of DVDs at home.<br /><br />What a shame...ins a masterpiece.

B000Y7U98C|4.0|Sunshine, a thoughtful doomsday picture about rebooting a failing sun, was conceived as a movie love letter to science fiction.  To that end it succeeds as a more intelligent than usual disaster flick, using the same general storyline as 'Armageddon' and 'the Core', but filling it with dialogue and thought rather than explosions.  Unfortunately, as the movie draws to its inevitable conclusion 2 things happen [1] the photography becomes choppy and hard to follow and [2] the plot starts pulling in pieces of other sci-fi movies ranging everywhere from Aliens to the Fantastic Four to Deep Impact.  What goes very right for this movie is the complex decisions that the characters ended up having to mull over as situations force them up against remarkable obstacles and the true-to-life dialogue.  I found myself thinking that I might have said the same kind of thing under those circumstances.  In the end, this is a smart and mostly realistic end of the world story that is not quite as enjoyable or watchable as your common Michael Bay picture; that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you are in the mood for.  If you need your space dramas to have major explosions at regular intervals this might not be the sci-fi vehicle for you.
B00005JPTK|1.0|The only thing this film has in common with book it's based on is the title.  Moving the location from Southern California to New York can be forgiven, but turning the mutated population into mindless animals is unforgivable.  Read the book, watch the Omega Man (which this is actual closer to), check late night TV for an airing of \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" with Vincent Price, but stay away from this butchering of a Science Fiction tale.
0756404746|5.0|This is a great book with complex characters and an ever thickening plot.  I had tears in my eyes for Kvothe's pain and joy for his triumphs.  I want to know more, what made the man wee see as the barkeep and how telling his story may awaken him to what he was and will be in the future and I want to know how Kvothe's past influenced the current events that are slowly unraveling during his telling.  720 pages in three days (a very compelling read); oh how I hate waiting!

B000002GA8|1.0|Once upon a time, the world famous rock pianist Richard Wakeman wrote a couple of half-tunes. After not having finished them, he handed them to his arranger, a serious musical mind called Lou Littlejohn, and said: 'well, here are the basics. You think you can make a large scale symphonic sort of opera like thing out of this? I need to put out a new album.' Littlejohn nodded. He took the tapes home and worked feverishly for three weeks. Out came most enjoyable orchestral bits and pieces. Wakeman loved them. 'Now', he said, 'all we need to do is add my pub band and a newsreader, and there's my new masterpiece.'  Again, Littlejohn nodded and dared not speak, in awe of this keyboard giant, this hero of progressive rock. For a moment he considered asking Wakeman to include his name on the LP sleeve, but after another glance at the masters glittering golden cape, he thought better of it.
B001437DMA|3.0|As you can tell by the title, I'm like many others here... we love Joe but we are needing more. There are a few instances of originality here but overall it's business as usual. His last 3-4 discs are just becoming interchangeable. For most artists that would be disasterous, for Joe it's merely just below the excellence he's capable of.    Some of it may just be too much touring but even looking at the enclosed artwork is yawn inducing; a couple of pics with Joe looking around.. is this the best and most original the minds at the Satriani Camp can come up with?    I too have been a fan since Surfing and can remember the first time Crystal Planet dropped on my doorstep.. like a ton of bricks! But lately it's just been a couple of good sized rocks.    Didn't the voice box effect (ala I Just Wanna Rock) go out with Bon Jovi in the early 90's?
B000088DSQ|3.0|I'm a big fan of authenticists such as Hogwood/Pinnock/Kuijken/Fey/Jacobs - but Maestro Harnoncourt's pretentious readings often leave me cold. Stressing every note 'marcato' combined with grinding gear changes in an effort to sound like artists trying to get to the essence of the score often just makes the whole project fall apart - just what happens here all to often. (The same is true of his recent Haydn Paris symphonies set.) Don't get me wrong: Harnoncourt has acheived some wonderful recordings: his Beethoven symphonies cycle and much of his Mozart, but in this autopsy of what the pianist snootily tells us is too often recorded (by others, but 'just enough' by him!) we are just left with the bits and pieces of the score's body strewn through the studio.
0385338724|5.0|This book is about a woman who suffers amnesia after a car accident. Lexi can't remember anything from the last three years, and a lot has changed since her last memories. She's now moved up in her company, so she's the boss of the people she used to work with. And she's now married, to the handsome and amazing Eric. Things could not be better for her. But what happens when she finds out that her so-called perfect life isn't as perfect as it appears to be?<br /><br />I read this book right after Memoirs of a Teenage Amnesiac to keep with the amnesia/memory loss theme (it was a coincidence that I had them both at the same time). Despite the similar theme, I would not be able to compare the two books. While Memoirs of a Teenage Amnesiac was a memorable book, it was more serious and thought-provoking, while Remember Me? was a lighter, funner read. Sophie Kinsella's latest novel is full of wit, sarcasm, and hilarious laugh out loud moments that kept me interested to the end. While not recommended for heavy, serious reading, Remember Me? is perfect if you're looking to sit down with a good book and just have a good time. Lexi is a genuine character, and you'll find yourself rooting for her throughout her entire journey.
B0012E2HRC|4.0|A love story for sure but a doomed one. The ending \\"what if\\" can drive you crazy if debated. It's like the chicken and the egg argument, it just goers on and on. Should she have followed her heart? She was right, soon after, a relationship based on passion can not last because the passion dissipates over time.<br />Besides that, this movie is loaded with passion and fire between two people mutually attracted to each other. When Francesca comes down stairs wearing her jeans and her hair is down, she is very HOT!!!<br />A great date movie. Buy it, it's worth it!!
B0000025JT|5.0|Absolutely the best CD album I have ever owned!!! \\"Guilty\\", \\"Woman in love\\", and \\"What kind of fool\\" are my all-time favorites.

B000VSBX34|2.0|The Beatles were at the height of their fame when this movie was made, so it was guaranteed to get big box office, which it did.  A Hard Days' Night was excellent, this sorry excuse for a follow-up is an abomination.  There are a few funny scenes and of course the music is good, although the lip-synching and pretend instrumentation are reminiscent of The Partridge Family.  John Lennon is clearly overweight and they all look like they're half-stoned alot of the time.  I'm a Beatle fan, but this is a clunker.  It's not that it hasn't aged well.  It wasn't good to begin with.  Pass.
B00142X56Y|5.0|This rendition of the opera is delightfull. The video is excellent and the sound is amazing.

This is truly a remarkable piece both the video and the performing perspectives. Can't wait for more!

B00006I53S|5.0|This lens has quickly become the one that lives on my camera. I shoot with a Digital Rebel XTi and this lens has done wonders for my photography. The IS is especially useful for low light - I have taken some great handheld shots in low light that would have been blurry without it. I would, however, HIGHLY recommend that the IS be turned off when using a tripod. I'm not used to having IS on a lens so I've had to put a reminder on my tripod to turn it off, otherwise I miss some good shots. I posted some of my photos here on Amazon for review. All of the photos were taken with this lens.<br /><br />I like everything about this lens. It's a bit heavy, but to me it feels nice and solid. I'll deal with the extra weight if it means my shots will be better. It's very quiet and the auto focus works smoothly and quickly. I have been able to get some pretty good action, landscape and wildlife shots as well as some really nice close ups of my dog. I'm saving up for a 70-200mm f/2.8 IS USM, but this one will more than hold me over until I can get it.

0452289963|4.0|I find this book to be directly in line with what the world needs. Practicing what this book preaches is the key to a better life and ultimatley a better world. The direct and forword approach to Tolle's writing cuts to the point and leaves no space for excuses. The western world needs to take these words to heart, loose some pride, and begin to think globaly. The message will not only bring an enlightend personal life but will also shape a new world right before your eyes. It can be a quick read but it needs to be meditated upon, so the seed will blossom into a beautiful life.

0060512806|1.0|I couldn't finish this book, finding I had no desire to read any more after I got about halfway through. There are several concurrent storylines, none of which have anything to do with each other except in the most peripheral sense. The book spends so much time plodding along, I found I had a surge of excitement when he finally got to the announcement of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. At last, something was happening! Unfortunately, the next page began \\"Three months later,\\". I was incredibly disappointed after hearing the rave reviews this book got, and now I am completely mystified how it received them.
0439813786|5.0|Don't let the three-inch thickness of this new award-winning book for  tweens keep you from opening this one.  This book has something for every reader--page-turning story, pages of gorgeous pencil sketches, and some nonfiction background to tie it all together in a unique offering. You'll find yourself reading along as you would an ordinary book when all of a sudden there are several pages of drawings to continue the story through pictures rather than words.  Then just as suddenly, the text will return.  It fits somewhere between a novel and a graphic novel, though really neither can claim it entirely.    After reading it, I shared it with a friend whose seventh-grade son had been turned off to reading by too many \\"packet attacks\\" on literature in school.  He read it cover to cover in a weekend and decided to give reading another chance. Ah!  The power of a good book!
B0000026CM|4.0|A strong album that really shows the band working together as a unit. The guitars are driving and powerful, the keyboards are very atmospheric, take their small cameo in 'stay away', very effective.  There are a mixture of the slower songs, 'Anna' is a gorgeous Steve Lukather led ballad that has an immediately likeable melody, if you like that soft, emotional love music as I do. 'Mushanga' is very atmospheric with many effective sections.'Stop loving you' is a pop song that also has a catchy melody and tight musicianship, I particularly like the harmony vocals. 'A thousand years' is a slow and fairly effective number.  Mid-tempo songs are the isntantly recognisable 'pamela', which has a hook that gets lodged in my brain. 'Straight for the heart' which is ok. 'These chains' is the second Steve Lukather lead vocal song, and the chorus is particularly strong, especially the climactic guitar ascending parts and the trumpets. The bass is also strong here. Good middle eight also. Another keeper.  'Home of the brave' is an extremely worthy conclusion to the record. Joseph Williams who dominates the lead vocals on the album (a welcome and expressive singer), and David Paich whose lead vocal duties seem to have diminished. It is obvious when this track starts, with the atmospheric keyboard and electric guitar hook that this is a standout track. David's part is the ballad part of the song and is tuneful. It is a lovely antithesis to Joseph's more 'aggressive' and high vocal spot. The chorus is also spectacular.   The only clunker of the whole bunch is 'you got me', the title is rubbish and the chorus is instantly irritating.   But that is only one track. The rest is great stuff.
006135323X|3.0|I am fascinated by the behavioral sciences -- why people do and don't do things, especially when their actions appear to be irrational.  Such was the theme of this book.  I was intrigued.  Regrettably, the author seems to believe he discovered a number of factors which contribute to human behavior, most of which are not in the best interests of the individual.  My disappointment comes in that his experiments led to conclusions that have been proven over many decades.  Most sales workshops teach to sell by contrast, to add a \\"decoy\\", to use the bandwagon approach.  Shoot, for years real estate agents and car salesman have used the dear resource technique on me -- \\"someone else is interested in this, too, so you'd better act fast if you really want it.\\"  I was hoping for an \\"AHA\\" and didn't find it.
B000005HN6|4.0|Yet on par with other bands at the same time, such as Dark Tranquillity's \\"The Gallery.\\"  The music on this is absolutely spectacular... I just wish it could have been done with the same quality as Hearse and everything thereafter.  (I'm an audio engineer, that = audio snob.)  In that light, since no one else has tackled production at length... *rolls up sleeves.*<br /><br />I think the few negative reviews you will find will be primarily tied into the recording quality, specifically the simple fact that in Sweden they were apparently unable to record a guitar sound that doesn't sound like its coming out of a shoebox from the time of oh, say about 1988 to 1995.  At the Gates and Carcass were the only bands that were somehow finally able to get guitar tones that didn't sound woefully weak.<br /><br />One production issue I have with this (and Advent... same exact setup.) is the decision to hard pan guitar parts to extreme right and extreme left.  If the user is say, using headphones, you get an extremely unnatural sound because normally there is a great deal of \\"air bleed\\" when listened to on speakers.  When the speakers are isolated as they are when wearing head/earphones, there is no bleed so you just get raw track data streaming in.  Some of you might say, \\"Well Mr. Seil, that's not a problem for me, in fact, I kind of like that.\\"  That's because I have a corn cob where it shouldn't be.  This recording decision sets up a problem because the theory behind recording a band is to try to capture an essence of the live event.  When have you ever been at a concert and only able to hear the guitars hard right and hard left?  You don't.  You get \\"a bit of right\\" and a \\"a bit of left\\" and a whole lot of crap right in the middle.  Usually just a whole lot of crap right in the middle because who really can distinguish stereo live?  The correct solution would have been to bleed the guitars a bit in the middle, it would have thickened them up and provided some much needed meat.  (Y'know, that beefy thing that metal guitars are supposed to be?  See \\"Slaughter of the Soul.\\")<br /><br />Now the benefits of hard panning:  namely dedicating discrete parts to discrete channels sounds AMAZING when done with a properly matched and placed pair of speakers.  But how many of you guys know proper speaker placement, and things like a 45 degree listening angle?  Well if you didn't, you know now.  Speakers should be at ear-level and each one angled 45 degrees to the exact point your head is supposed to be.  You'll get the bleed effect, and though it won't thicken things up too much, you'll get the best enjoyment out of the first two Opeth albums.  The theory behind hard panning is that when you play live, you have one amp per guitar and they'll just play into the room.  Again this fails in recording for anyone who listens in headphones.  (Like me.)<br /><br />Aside from that hiccup the first two albums are spectacular.  They'd rate a 5 from me, but I care about production.  No matter who you are.  Metal will never proceed as an art form if it uses outmoded concepts (and wimpy guitars.)beefy thing that metal guitars are supposed to be?

B0011NVC98|3.0|\\"Beowulf\\" has superhuman levels of brawling, which I should have expected from any version based on the story.  The violence is somewhat more extreme than I was expecting.  It's still comic book or cartoonish violence, lacking the poetry and epic grandeur of language I was hoping for.  Instead, the character Beowulf grandiously declaims a lot of bragging speeches.    Somehow, I thought the writers would invent slightly more plot.  I was hopeful when John Malkovich's treacherous character  showed up, but he wasn't much of a subplot.  The monsters are truly amazing, though, and Grendel's mother, played by Angelina Jolie, is gorgeously inhuman.  I won't give away the plot twist that Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary wrote to extend the story, except that they could have developed it more.  I liked King Hrothgar, voiced by Anthony Hopkins, and he had more of an emotional range than Beowulf, the hero's, character.  I'd give this a 6-7 out of 10 -- enjoyable and worth the money, but not required viewing.
B000002VCZ|5.0|I will go out on a limb and call this my fave APP album. It is full of accessible ballads, mainly sung by Eric Woolfson, which is definitely part of the appeal. When you throw in Colin Blunstone and Chris Rainbow with their ethereal voices, you have a fantastic album. I will mention one track, 'the same old sun'. I cannot shis is not praised see why it is not praised more. It is one of the best songs they have EVER done, period, and is the most melodic and beautiful with great vocals, instrumentation and lyrics. This is an excellent album, no matter what anyone says.

B000FGGERM|5.0|VERY few albums ever grab me in this way.  I had always been a fairly moderate Opeth fan... grabbing a slow appreciation for the harsh cookie-monster vocals.  (Which are completely clear and coherent and NOT an average death metal growl.)  This album has alot of clean singing too, and it's amazing that such a tender sounding voice comes from the same guy who growls from someplace beyond his stomach.  Now, I still have several Opeth cds to buy, mainly because this one IS JUST THAT GOOD.  All tracks are flawless, but Bleak is hands down one of my favorite metal songs ever produced.<br /><br />Perfect production qualities... all decisions were made with the utmost of care.  Just go buy it... if you buy no other album, buy this one.  I don't see how they could top it.
B0006L0LOS|1.0|Dont get it twisted. This is an awful film. Halle Berry cant take full blame for the reason why this movie sucks. The script was juvenile and corny. Halle Berry gives the worst performance of her illustrious acting career in this movie. She plays Patience Williams(wasnt the original Catwoman called Selina Kyle?), a timid beauty ad designer who accidently stumbles on to an evil plan by the owner of the company she works for. The evil plan involves marketing a beauty cream that is known to cause skin disorder and cancer. Patience is chased out of the building and into a drainage system where she falls to her doom and is revived by a cat.<br /><br />Opinion: This movie is humoruosly bad. Her origin with the cat that revives her is laughable. The way she walks so awkwardly(like she's had one too many catnip) in that tacky cat suit is a riot. The way she cracks that whip like an amateur dominatrix is hysterical. The fight scenes s well as the dialogue is laughable too. The most funniest and probably the worst scene in the movie is where she beats her soon-to-be boyfriend/cop in basketball with HIGH HEELS ON!!! She looked like a total goof dribbling that ball between her legs. Then there's those moments in the movie where you have to suspend your intellect like the time Halle slid through those prison bars without getting stuck or the fact that the toxic cream that the main villain is peddling makes her(the villian) immune to punches and kicks that would knock the average person unconscious.<br /><br />Closing comments: This is the worst movie that Halle Berry has ever starred in and is another blemish is her movie career. The acting is dreadful and the action is a joke. I would be surprised if she could still find work but then again if Eddie Murphy could find roles to play after the crappy I-Spy then Halle should be able to bounce back from this.<br /><br />To Halle: FIRE YOUR AGENT IMMEDIATELY!!!
B0014CQNTK|1.0|Although the movie isn't blatantly pro-life, an endorsement from the Catholic News Service for its pro-life message doesn't help its image.    Aside from that, I just didn't get it.  I thought the story would have been much better had it not been for the \\"witticisms\\" of the characters.  The dialogue sounded as if a 30-year old jaded Gen X-er wanted to desperately fit in with a 15-17 year old crowd.  Getting past the \\"honest to blog\\" and \\"wizard\\" sayings was tough.  They jump out at you.  It's like Joey Gladstone's \\"Cut. It. Out.\\" from Full House, but more prevalent and annoying.    I wanted to like the movie.  I liked the storyline, and thought it was on its way to being well done, but the overuse of awful catch phrases and the overly-witty Juno did it in for me.    Jason Bateman and Michael Cera did an amazing job, as did J.K. Simmons.  Their performances were well worth all the hype this movie's getting, and the film is worth watching for these guys.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|I heard Bleed It Out on the radio, thought it sounded like Linkin Park did in earlier albums.  That was the only good song on the album.  The rest was junk, far too much politics.  Linkin Park - stay with what you're good at, politics isn't it.
B00154GEFU|3.0|Okay, I'll be the one to play both sides of the Asia camp since I can tell from the first five reviews no one probably will, or at least not yet.  At first listen, this sounds remarkably like a John Wetton solo album. To the reviewer who states \\"Does anyone remember keyboards\\" where have you been for the past five Asia albums?  Listen to their last album 'Silent Nation' and notice the keyboards which are probably more prevalent than in this new recording. And why is this the follow-up to 'Alpha' and not Astra? (oh, that's right, not all four were present for that recording)  While I'll give this album a thumbs up for the original four getting back together and setting aside their differences this album is more on the mellow side compared to the debut as is the artwork from Roger Dean and it will be pretty hard not to compare to Asia of yesteryear since it's been 25 years since a release of the original four.  But, if you listen to Wetton's solo projects or the Wetton/Downes Icon project this album could be just that.  While I noticed the \\"keyboards\\" I also noticed the Howe 'Yes' sytle playing that he has become famous for.  Carl Palmer's drumming could have come from anyone else out there and his playing really seemed to sit in the background.  I'm trying not to be negative here, but I guess I expected more from these four, supposedly very talented musicians.  I've stayed with Asia from the debut through the John Payne era and their last album 'Silent Nation' which I think was probably their best out of the five albums the group recorded with Payne.  I will probably get blasted here for my review, but that's okay because, after all, this is just my opinion.  Their two long compositions I seem to like the best because they portray the most progressive side on this album while the other songs are just good pop/rock songs and some just a little too slow for my taste.  Maybe, it is because they are more mature, but I just wanted more. They borrowed the riff for 'Never Again' from 'Heat of the Moment' and 'Heroine' gets borrowed from 'The Smile Has Left Your Eyes'.  Very disappointing. I'm not sure if the reviewers here are from the first two or three Asia album fans and have jumped back on the bandwagon or have listened to Asia throughout their career.  Without Downes and Payne keeping the name of Asia alive since 1994 I feel it's very unlikely that there would have been a reunion at all and then this could have been the next Icon album from Wetton and Downes. Give credit to Geoff Downes for keeping Asia together throughout the years because he has finally come full circle with the original four back together again. Arguably, someone else will write a review discussing the differences between the original Asia and the Asia that Geoff Downes kept going because even if you didn't like John Payne's voice (and I would be in that camp more times than not) their music was some of their best especially on their last and probably, on the one that got shelved (Architect of Time) after the original four got back together.  Overall, it's an okay album with enough to keep the original four Asia fan base very content.  Happy listening however you view this album, good, bad or just middle of the road.<br /><br />On a side note:  for those of you who have thought that my 3 star review is too harsh, then check out RPWL and their latest release, \\"The RPWL Experience\\".  Best album so far of 2008 and totally blows away this thrown together album by ASIA of leftover songs from the past twenty five years.gain' from 'Heat of the Moment' and 'Heroine' gets borrowed from 'The Smile Has Left Your Eyes'.

B00003TL18|2.0|I purchased this as a set as it has an Audio-DVD with it. The regular DVD is fine, but you can't play the Audio-DVD as it has a CPPM code and it cannot be played by any DVD player or DVD program. It ask for the code which cannot be found. To be honest the only reason why I purchased it was for the extra tracks on the Audio-DVD.    If someone can help me that would be nice by making a comment on this post.
B00005V9IK|5.0|I love this movie. I have seen it a million times and like it more and more.  It is fun, moving, cheesy, sweet, exciting, and has Will Smith.  What more do you need to be entertained?
B0010358CG|5.0|ExMachina is a sequel to the 2005 Appleseed.  It continues the story of Deunan and Briarios as they go about their lives in ESWAT.  Even though I did not find the new story as compelling as the previous, this time there is much more character development with a deeper background for the both of them.  The CG really shines in Blu-Ray, and provides some of the most life-like and vivid scenes ever encountered in an animated movie.
B00104QSOM|1.0|I can't say how much I hated this movie.  The main reasons are:<br /><br />1) It depicts Christianity in a very evil and slanderous way.  A major element of this film is a young \\"preacher\\" and a \\"church\\" which the local people are very committed to.  The preacher and the church were  cartoonish in their evil, bizarre and kooky beliefs, and in their mean behavior.<br /><br />2) The central character is a rotten man.  He is an industrious and, in many ways, successful businessman.  However, he hates people in general, is murderous, and full of selfish ambition.  He appears to be a socialist's cartoonish view of \\"greedy\\" capitalism.<br /><br />3) The \\"music\\" was very grating and annoying, for quite a bit of the movie.  This noise is akin to fingernails on a blackboard.  It seemed intentional, to create an uneasy mood.  However, it was just very unpleasant--not something I want to hear in my living room.<br /><br />4) There was very little depicted in the movie that was noble, uplifting, encouraging, or virtuous.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this movie was evil and useless nihilism.  It's primary statement is that people and life are rotten, then you die.  It's depiction of Christianity and capitalism are not just cartoonish, but seem to be intentionally slanderous.
B0010X745K|4.0|When it comes to Stephen King's films being adapted for the big screen, it's usually a crap-shoot. There have been some films that were extraordinarily bad, some that we extraordinarily good, and some that were just so-so.    \\"The Mist\\", however, is one of the films that holds up well when compared to the original story, except for the ending. The book ends with a slight hope for the future, whereas the film had a \\"Twilight Zone-ish\\" ending. Why Frank Darabont (who did amazing work with \\"The Green Mile\\") chose to make such a change is beyond me, but I guess in the long run, it did have more of an emotional impact.    I was able to identify with the characters and their initial plight (surviving Hurricane Katrina was similar to what the townspeople went through during the aftermath of the storm, though on a MUCH smaller scale)and I truly cared about what happened to them.    A simple trip to the supermarket quickly turns into a nightmare and the pace and suspense of the film never lets up until the very end. The special effects are quite convincing and the performances by the actors are very well done.    Overall, \\"The Mist\\" is a very good horror/suspense film that should keep you quite entertained for the two-hour running time. You will want to keep the kiddies away from this one, though. Lots of swearing, graphic violence, scary creatures, and a bit of gore.    Not recommended for the feint of heart.
B000K6QIQO|5.0|This 1970 release is long out of print from The Beatles. It features 10 non-album hit singles, spanning 1964-1969, a nice, five-year period.     The record features the now-classic rock radio staple 'Can't Buy Me Love.' At the time, this was a hard-to-find single, and it wasn't released on an official record until 'A Hard Days Night,' but it's cool to see it here.    Other classics that are on this set include 'Lady Madonna,' 'Hey Jude,' 'Revolution,' 'Rain' and 'Don't Let Me Down.'    Overall, you can't go wrong with one of the most famous bands of all-time. If you are a Beatles collector, than you need this album. Highly recommended for any Beatles fan. ENJOY!!!

B0010YSD7M|5.0|As long-time fans of the SG-1 series, my wife and I eagerly awaited the arrival of \\"The Ark Of Truth\\" and we found it well worth the wait. We were delighted to find that the quality of the writing, direction and acting were up to the best episodes of the series long run. Any fan of Stargate is bound to be pleased with this film and will anxiously await, as we do, the next installment!
0823003590|4.0|William Maughan's book \\"Drawing the Head\\" is worth buying just for the illustrations alone. But, it is also a fundamentally sound guide as to how to achieve likeness in a realistic albeit artistic fashion. It looks so easy but, that is, often the case with art instruction books. In fact, the steps that Maughan clearly sets out i.e. gesture, proportions,shadow shapes,edge control and detail, are each mountains that have to climbed until, that glorious day when we hope everything comes together. And even then we will still be starting out. This book is a truly informative guide as to what mountains have to be climbed. The student will, however, have to provide the effort and do the climbing. The didactic way in which the examples are coupled to the text is commendable and a joy to follow, the drawings inspiring. The student is educated on materials and how to use them. An unexpected but thrilling chapter on creating aliens out of yourself or friends is wonderful. If only the last chapter on colour could have been extended to show more clearly how some of those effects were rendered. But, I think, thats just me being greedy for more from this gifted and distinguished artist. Buy the book and if you can tear yourself away from wondering at the illustrations, get on and use it. That's what its for.Your bound to become better.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|I knew if I let the album play out entirely I would like it just like 'Worldwide Underground.' Both are experimental and don't sound anything like it's predecessor but the albums each have a continuous groove and are amazing with more and more play. I'm very interested to see where she goes with Part 2 based on what she's given us thus far.
B0006J28BO|4.0|I wasn't sure about this particular Miyazaki film since I'm not a big fan of the cover.  A cat in a suit?  Hrm.

B000005RU2|3.0|It was hard for me to rate this cd recording. I really don't like it. It is live performances I guess from Japan. I don't consider it the best of Deep Purple.

1401307787|4.0|While I recognize that the power of some books rest only in that they come along at the right time of one's life...this book was simply beautiful.  From the first chapter until about 3/4 of the way through, I was completely drawn in and found most of what Kabat-Zinn wrote to be compelling, relevant and so totally perceptive.  He spends the first half of the book building the case for meditation and what it means for live life in the present moment of everyday.  He then goes into detail about how to effectively meditate.  I also purchased the tape companion meditation tapes and have used them to great effect.  The book and the tapes have been a great introduction to the power of meditation in one's life.

B0013FXWU6|1.0|When am I going to learn? I listened to the critics again. Maybe they could try to be sober the next time they write a review. Is it possible for the big studios to bribe these critics? Naahh. A typical Daniel Day Lewis psycho, vein popping, role. Not to mention the soundtrack from Hell. A lesson in futility. This mind numbing, advertisement for Prozac, is considered deserving awards? Around my house, when a turd appears, we flush it.
B0014CQNTK|4.0|I can't recall any movie in recent memory that got such a quick audience turnaround then Juno. People seemed genuinely excited that after the bombast of last summer, here comes a film that actually took story and character first and yet now people have completely turned on the film and called it overrated and not funny at all. While there's some nitpicks I can say about the film, the amount of backlash and criticisms laid upon the film seem kind of unfair. This film isn't made to get the discussions going and highlight social issues a la the Iraq War films; it's just simply a family movie, lighthearted in tone and fun to watch.    Juno MacGuff is a young 16 year old who discovers that a night with best friend Paulie Bleeker brings the gift of pregnancy, or burden in her case and wants to have an abortion. Changing her mind and having birth go straight to adoption, she finds the perfect parents in Mark and Vanessa Loring but what we want and what we get can be 2 completely different things as Juno learns about life the hard way earlier than most.    Juno can be described as a message film with the message actually never being said out loud. Whereas most films are content to have the theme said in dialogue, Juno takes the more smarter approach in showing the responsibilities and changing views that can come with pregnancy and it's not enough to be able to financially handle it, you have to know personally you can. Course many parents become unexpected mothers and fathers and many succeed but Juno doesn't explicitly say out loud the idea of \\"be prepared to handle the surprises of life\\" but it still works in the end.     First, my one negative and its in the writing. Award-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody writes a very touching, sweet and realistic portrayal of the changes that come with parenthood which I felt were nicely handled but then we get the dialogue. Lines like \\"honest to blog?\\" and \\"Thundercats are go!\\" to signal the water breaking just seem...strange and youstart to ask yourself whether anyone, let alone young teenagers, talk like this. But then other lines work and some of it was actually funny but I can see why people might not find it working for the film.    Acting-wise it largely falls on Ellen Page's shoulders who shows the maturity and yet the naivety of someone old enough to know she doesn't know everything. We also get turns from reliable Jason Bateman, J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's parents, Jennifer Garn..um, Affleck, and Michael Cera who always brings that deadpan humor though sometimes I feel it's just his Arrested Development character in movie form, but it's still a solid acting ensemble.    Even though it looks like a film for everyone, not everyone will get its brand of humor but like the film anyway while others find it completely unfunny but I'd give it a shot anyway though to test the waters, try it with a crowd. Laughter is contagious, you know?
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This DVD is simply amazing.  It contains the band's live performance at Slane Castle in Ireland, their first concert series after the release of \\"By the Way.\\"  In the concert they perform the bulk of their songs from both \\"By the Way\\" and \\"Californication.\\"  They also do a cover of a Ramone's song, \\"Havana Affair.\\"  Between songs the band jams out and even does a couple of other covers, including the timeless \\"Maybe.\\"  Flea even gets a little of the spotlight for himself with a Trumpet solo during the encore.  The band finishes up the concert with three hits off \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik:\\" \\"Give it Away,\\" \\"Under the Bridge,\\" and \\"Power of Equality.\\"  They also perform \\"Californication\\" during their encore at the end of the DVD.  If you remotely enjoyed any of the albums or songs mentioned here, you will forever be pleased by watching this timeless performance of one of the greatest bands of the alternative era.

B00005M989|5.0|First off, I admit to being a huge, long-time Prince fan.  That being said, it's pretty hard to argue that this 'Very Best of' isn't a jammin' collection.  Starting off with 'I Wanna Be Your Lover' and working its way through 'Money Don't Matter 2 Night', this album (can I still use that word?) is a timeline of Prince's fun, sexy, rockin', jammin', preachin' career from \\"For You\\" (although no tracks off that first album are included) through \\"Diamonds and Pearls\\".  And even though there are numerous tracks any fan might want to add to the mix, most all of the included tunes are vital to a 'hits' collection.  (I might let you argue that tracks 13 and 17 could have been replaced with better choices, but that's the most slack I could cut.  ;-)  If you're just not sure that you know the Prince songs included well enough to purchase, just take a listen to 'I Wanna Be Your Lover', 'Little Red Corvette', 'Kiss', or 'Gett Off' to get a good feel for what's in store for you.  You really can't go wrong with this single CD collection of his royal badness's bestest.  :-)
B00104QSOM|5.0|To say this movie is great is an understatement. In my opinion, this is one of the most amazing film ever made. Day-Lewis's acting is flawless as a lonely, greedy oil man. Paul Dano's performance as Eli Sunday is also intense and paired perfectly with Day-Lewis.   However, the DVD does lack special features. With a film like this, one expects something cool. It would have been nice to have a \\"making of\\" or something like that. But, the movies brilliance outshines the lack of extras.
B000A2H8WQ|5.0|This, like \\"Jook Joint\\", is a five star, all out aural attack from Q's wide range of superstar friends.

Honestly, you can't go wrong with this.
0060855924|4.0|\\"The Color of Magic\\" is an enjoyable introduction to a satirical fantasy world. This story follows Twoflower, a tourist whose Luggage has a bite worse than its bark, and Rincewind the wizard, an anti-hero. As Twoflower discovers parts of the Discworld he's only dreamt about, the reluctant Rincewind has to come face to face with his own cowardice (and even Death itself) in order to look after the tourist. In a universe where the world is flat and resides on four large elephants on a giant turtle and the gods play dice games with the character's lives, a reader can get lost in the humor and wit of this excellent British author. I am looking forward to continuing my holiday in the Discworld universe with the next installment.

B0013FXWU6|1.0|This is one of the 10 worst films I have ever seen.  The story was poor, the telling of the story was poor, and the acting was horrid.  I have always been a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis and was very dissappointed by this film.  Some might say that due to the complex nature of the supposed story that I didn't understand what was happening but many of my favorite films, such as \\"The English Patient\\", are complex and require that you pay attention to the film.  This film is just bad.
B00009P1O5|3.0|Neil's blues album, I guess. Sometimes lame, though not at all bad. As an example of \\"lame\\", take those ridiculous mock-trumpet backup vocals on \\"Op-er-a Star\\". Not the kind of things I listen to Neil Young for. And \\"T-Bone\\" is crappy too: one riff, one lyric (\\"Got mashed potatoes, ain't got no t-bone!\\"), nine minutes. On the upside, some of these songs do have that satisfying, hilarious crunch (\\"Surf-er Joe and Moe the Sleaze\\"; the boogie \\"Get Back On it\\"; the chugging \\"South-ern Pa-ci-fic\\", with a guitar part that imitates a train; \\"Rap-id Tran-Sit\\") that I associate with Neil's rock songs. Unfortunately, when the riffs aren't hard-hitting, the songs totally suffer (\\"Mo-Tor City\\", with a misplaced country bassline and bad lyrics about the perceived awful quality of American cars - I think there was more bad things going on in the early '80s than crappy cars, don't you?). 'Course, no sane man, woman, or child's gonna argue this is any better than anything old-school from Neil. It's just average, there are no massive finds, and \\"Shots\\" is self-indulgent mire. Still, it's far better than what was to come.

B000TBG8HY|5.0|The Beatles, as it has been said too many times to count, really hit their stride in the late '60s. Especially in 1966-1967, when they put out three classic albums: Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and this right here. Probably the trippiest, weirdest, looniest album that the group ever put out. Maybe it's not as good as its monumental predecessors, but who cares?<br />There are a couple songs that are hit-or-miss for me, though. If I'm in the right mood, I can really dig the bizarre, psychedelic-Eastern ramblings of Harrison's \\"Blue Jay Way\\", but when I'm not in said mood they me cold. \\"Flying\\" is pleasant, but not much else.<br />And then there are nine other songs that pretty much all vie for my favorite on this album. Some are famous, some aren't. Everyone knows \\"All You Need is Love\\", that wonderful hippy anthem, with 7/4-4/4 time changes; the slightly dippy but amazingly infectious \\"Hello Goodbye\\", and Paul's pop triumph \\"Penny Lane\\". Those are all amazing, and there's more! \\"I Am the Walrus\\" might be the strangest song ever recorded by a famous band. The lyrics are nonsense on purpose, the backing track often borders on avant-garde, its fade is accompanied by excerpts from a radio broadcast of \\"King Lear\\", and the song is actually three unfinished tunes put together. One of my favorite Beatles tracks, precisely because it's so far out there. Is anyone surprised that this one was John's? He also wrote the well-known \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", a beautiful psychedelic ballad that may or may not be about acid. Of course, John always denied it, but you can definitely hear the drug influence in the lyrics. And the coda, a psychedelic whirlwind, is amazing. And I love pretty much every element of \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\" - the chorus, the melody, the traded vocals in the verses, and that little psychedelic noise that runs throughout the tune. I don't know what that thing is, but it makes the song.<br />That's not to discount the two opening songs, of course. The \\"see-the-show!\\" title track might not be as good as the previous albums \\"see-the-show!\\" title track, but it's fun, and it has this great part near the end when it slows down and the melody is carried by phased vocals. And while \\"Penny Lane\\" is one of Paul's better light-hearted ballads, \\"The Fool on the Hill\\" is one of his best depressing ballads.<br />This is one of the Beatles' more underappreciated records, probably because half of it was the soundtrack to a universally panned movie of the same name which I've never seen, and half was a collection of singles. I see it's getting more recognition these days, and I'm glad for it, because it's one of the Beatles' greatest albums.The \\"see-the-show!\\" title track might not be as good as the previous albums \\"see-the-show!\\" title track, but it's fun, and it has this great part near the end when it slows down and the melody is carried by phased vocals.

Harv Eker from Secrets of the Millionaire Mind<br /><br />How’s your financial blueprint?<br /><br />Don’t worry, I didn’t know either until I read T. Harv Eker’s great (and surprisingly funny!) book. If you’re committed to creating financial freedom then my (strong) recommendation is that you add this to your must read (or must re-read as appropriate).<br /><br />Here's a quick look at some of my favorite big ideas (this book is so full of them I had to stop myself at 21!)—from defining financial freedom, learning to play to win (vs. playing not to lose) to seeing how the size of your character determines your response to various sized problems.<br /><br />What you’ll see is that T. Harv believes strongly in the fact that “Your inner world reflects your outer world” and dedicates a great deal of the book to teaching us how to change our thinking— to re-program ourselves to think and act like rich people do.<br /><br />Here are some of the Big Ideas:<br /><br />1. Playing to Win - vs. Playing not to lose.<br />2. Fruits & Roots - Tap roots for better fruits.<br />3. Declarations - vs. Affirmations.<br />4. P--&#62;T--&#62;F--&#62;A--&#62;R - Good equation to know.<br />5. Grow! - And your income will grow.<br /><br />Let’s get to work on that financial blueprint, shall we?!?<br /><br />(More goodness--including PhilosophersNotes on 250+ books at http://www.brianjohnson.me)
B000006SGT|4.0|Four stars for a great compilation. But a caveat- I've received two CDs in a row of this where the last track on CD1 had digital crackle/distortion or simply wouldn't play. It's only a two minute track but....  Seeing that no one else has mentioned it here, I suppose I'm the lucky receipient of two defective discs in a row. Maybe I should've gone the third round but 'nuffs enuff already. Animals is a great band, tho.  Seeing now that the former price has almost doubled, maybe amazon has found non-defective pressings; which also include the radio message listed on CD2 but nowhere to be found.

Soak it then in such trains of thoughts as, for example: Where life is possible at all, a right life is possible.\\" ~ Marcus Aurelius from \\"Meditations\\"<br /><br />Not only is Marcus Aurelius one of my heroes, he's also one of history's leading Stoic Philosophers. Stoic philosophy. You know, one of the classic Hellenistic philosophies--right there with Epicureanism and Cynicism.<br /><br />Huh?<br /><br />Whether or not you've heard of Stoicism, you've probably met one of its leading thinkers: Marcus Aurelius--he's the old emperor in the movie \\"Gladiator.\\" :)<br /><br />Quick historical context:<br /><br />It was in the 2nd Century, during battles against Barbarian tribes in the Danube region near Hungary (not unlike the opening scene of \\"Gladiator\\"), when Aurelius wrote \\"Meditations.\\"<br /><br />Imagine the powerful Roman Empire: encompassing vast territory from England to Spain and Africa, to Egypt, Arabia and Turkey. This is the Empire that Marcus Aurelius defended from barbarians and pestilence and plague at every border. Now, you can imagine Aurelius, the Emperor of this vast empire, trained in the Stoic philosophy, reminding himself to live the philosophy during some of the most trying times of his rule--in the battlefields of war.<br /><br />Interestingly, the literal translation of the title is \\"To Himself\\"--as Aurelius was simply jotting notes to himself in his private journal. His intention was not to publish anything; rather, he used his journal to remind himself of the lessons he learned as a young nobleman being groomed to one-day rule the empire. The book is broken down into bite-size nuggets of wisdom that you can enjoy a few minutes at a time. I highly recommend you start enjoying!

Success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease. And yet success, including the creation of wealth, has always been considered to be a process that requires hard work, and it is often considered to be at the expense of others. We need a more spiritual approach to success and affluence, which is the abundant flow of all good things to you. With the knowledge and practice of spiritual law, we put ourselves in harmony with nature and create with carefreeness, joy, and love.”<br /><br />~ Deepak Chopra from The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success<br /><br />I’ll just start by saying this is one of those truly life-changing kinda books. Perhaps I should offer a warning.<br /><br /> —&#62; WARNING: Do not read this book unless you are ready to transform your life! :) &#60;—<br /><br />On my last re-read (I’ve read it several times), I was so inspired by a heightened sense of clarity around my “Dharma”—one of the Seven Spiritual Laws—that I sold the business I was running at the time (Zaadz) within about 60 days of realizing I had a higher purpose to fulfill. Powerful.<br /><br />Although a small book and a quick read, it may win the award for word-for-word most wise book out there—it’s PACKED with wisdom. (Actually, on further reflection, it DEFINITELY wins the award. If it’s not on your shelf yet, I highly recommend it! :)<br /><br />It’s literally one big quote.<br /><br />If you could see my copy, you’d see that more of it is underlined and marked up than not.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|I had previously purchased the International version because it was cheaper, but I was very frustrated with having to turn off the subtitles every time I viewed an episode.  I also found that the DVDs used didn't play in all DVD players, I had to make my own playlist, and the envelopes in which the disks were stored were rather flimsy.    This version is great - no subtitles, plays in all players, is conveniently and sturdily boxed, and has a book with all the episodes on each disk.  I feel it is well worth the additional cost and is a bargain at that price.
B00151HZME|5.0|M83's sole core member, Anthony Gonzalez, calls Saturdays=Youth his paean to being a teenager and the discovery that comes with it. In fact, I've always linked M83's music to that volatile period of time, no matter how Gonzalez intended for me to hear it. The flagrantly synthetic drones on Dead Cities, Red Seas and Lost Ghosts (2003) and the exploding circuits on Before the Dawn Heals Us (2005) resembled cascades of emotion pouring out after years of repression. There's a subtle but perceptible hint of violence rumbling at the bottom of songs like \\"In Church\\" and \\"On a White Lake, Near a Green Mountain\\" that would erupt if only it could make it past the layers of heaving synths that crush it. With an impossibly expansive sound and an inclination to remain in a perpetual state of emotional release, M83's discography is a terrifyingly close aural approximation of--to borrow one of his song titles--\\"Teen Angst.\\"<br /><br />On Saturdays=Youth, Gonzalez aims to transport us to a happier place, to cut out the garbage and the herky-jerky experiences that inevitably populated our youth. \\"I loved being a teenager,\\" Gonzalez explains in the album's press release, \\"That's when I discovered music and started to take drugs and party with my friends.\\" However we spent our Saturdays as teenagers, they were respites from the drudgery of the rest of the week, when we could cut our teeth on being young in a big, beautiful world. Working with coveted producers Ken Thomas and Ewan Pearson (the latter of whom is responsible for some of the most joyous remixes of the decade) to bring that respite back into our consciousness, Gonzalez more than delivers, not only making us nostalgic for the past, but even filling in the gaps of what may have never been.<br /><br />Saturdays=Youth is M83's most conceptually loaded record, but it also features his most manageable songs--easy to digest and easier to love. I know fans who didn't care for Before the Dawn Heals Us, perhaps because of its tart flavors and a few tracks that were jammed in neutral, but Saturdays=Youth remains sweet-sounding and elated throughout. It begins with \\"You Appearing,\\" a dramatic introduction that starts with a simplistic piano line and ends with blossoming synths and hypnotic vocals, as though Gonzalez were documenting the point at which the possibilities of the teen years are first revealed. Next comes \\"Kim & Jessie,\\" M83's most elemental pop song to date. Lyrics have always been incidental to the effect of M83's music, but I love the tension in Gonzalez's words: \\"Kim and Jessie / They have a secret world in the twilight.\\" What will they do in that world? The song's tone suggests that whatever happens will make the titular characters feel young, free and alive. Even when the songs contain a shade of mystery, as on \\"Skin of the Night,\\" they seem to be traveling toward someplace unequivocally wonderful.<br /><br />Though Gonzalez was actually a teenager in the '90s (he's 26), it was important to him that Saturdays=Youth channeled '80s synth-pop bands such as Depeche Mode and Tears for Fears. And while \\"Up!\\" and the album's first single \\"Couleurs\\" sport an undeniable '80s fetish, the dominant influence on Saturdays=Youth is still early-'90s British shoegaze, as it has been on all of M83's previous records. The spirit of Cocteau Twins, Pale Saints and My Bloody Valentine hang over Saturdays=Youth like guardian angels, especially on \\"Graveyard Girl,\\" \\"We Own the Sky,\\" and the absolutely swoon-worthy \\"Dark Moves of Love.\\" Shoegaze is both an idealistic and nostalgic genre, refreshingly free of pessimistic overtones, so it would make sense that M83 would tap into it for this record. When all of the instruments pile up and form a tidal wave of unthinkably gorgeous sound, as they do on nearly every song here, it will always bring me back to Kevin Shields trying his very hardest to create the definitive soundtrack to young love.<br /><br />Before \\"Dark Moves of Love\\" even has a chance to finish, the long, sobering drone of the final track, \\"Midnight Souls Still Remain,\\" takes over and we're suddenly back within a corporeal reality. It's at this point that the unabashed joy and freedom of being a teenager transitions into young adulthood, with its responsibilities, limitations, and awareness of mortality. Knowing how M83 conceptualized his epic closers of the past (\\"Beauties Can Die,\\" \\"Lower Your Eyelids to Die with the Sun\\"), this interpretation would fit, and it's apparent that Gonzalez is thinking about the finiteness of life and the world as much as anyone else in his mid-20's would be. Yet \\"Midnight Souls Still Remain\\" may be Gonzalez's way of keeping these memories contained in a kind of box where they can be accessed whenever we feel like revisiting them. After all, Saturdays=Youth isn't the past as we young adults lived it (that would be Limp Bizkit and Masta Ace for me, unfortunately), but as we remember it, and memories can outlive everything else. Our Saturdays and our youth may be long gone, but we can always come back to this.f the final track, \\"Midnight Souls Still Remain,\\" takes over and we're suddenly back within a corporeal reality.

B000WGWQG8|3.0|I generally enjoyed the series. But as some have already mentioned here, the inexplicable tilting of the camera is a real annoyance. It is the major flaw in the series and adds nothing except the idea that Adams lived in a 'crazy' time, if that was even the intent. Like the old Batman series, where the Riddler's lare was on this perpetual tilt to depict the 'chaos'. Maybe that was the same idea. Who knows? A shoulder held camera would have been much more appropriate, giving the viewer the sense of 'being there'.

0452289963|5.0|I first read this book when it was released a few years ago. Having already read \\"The Power of Now\\" and many other spiritual books, I was quite familiar with the concepts addressed. Nevertheless, I was (and continue to be) amazed by Tolle's ability to put into simple words many spiritual teachings that others have failed to make comprehensible. These teachings are deeply satisfying and liberating when truly understood.    Some reviewers complain that Tolle has nothing \\"new\\" to say, which may be true. What is remarkable is Tolle's ability to communicate the \\"incomprehensible\\" -- to enable us to fathom spiritual insights that can change our lives. He demystifies many so-called spiritual mysteries. He makes \\"living in the now\\" not merely an abstract concept but a vivid reality that almost anyone can grasp.     Most of the reviewers who give \\"A New Earth\\" a single star have clearly not even read the book. They are apparently religious fanatics who will do anything to discredit a world view other than their own, which says more about the state of their own egos than about Tolle's truly insightful book. If they actually read and understood this extraordinary book, it would leave them speechless.

B0010ZR160|5.0|I first heard of this film project in November of 2005 when Dan Rissner, one of the co-producers, contacted me to ask for the manuscript of an unpublished baseball novel I had on the back burner. I found him open and down to earth, and while he wasn't able to pull things together, I became interested in his work.     I've now seen the final product and I am impressed. It's not often I buy a DVD for my collection, but this time I did. All success storys begin with savvy casting, and here the producers made truly excellent choices: Casey Affleck might be a bit fuzzy cheeked, but he fit the iron-willed investigator perfectly, and the chemistry between him and his business partner/girlfriend Allie (Michelle Monaghan)felt genuine. Of course, with old pros Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman in supporting roles, the backup cast had to outdo itself and happily that's what they did. I was particularly taken with Amy Ryan as the undeserving and graceless mother of the kidnapped child. She was so convincing, I actually hoped she wouldn't end up getting her kid back.     Gone Baby Gone is not a happy story. It depicts life in the city where everything is hard-edged, nothing is ever for sure and openness and honesty are usually the first casualties. Highly recommended.

B000TM1CL0|5.0|I've always respected James Woods as an actor. I've always thought of him as unique. He has a very unique image, has a very unique style and his choice of roles over the years have, I've always felt, marked him out as, well, unique. \\"Ghosts of Mississippi\\", \\"True Crime\\", \\"Any Given Sunday\\". Even his appearance on \\"ER\\" a few seasons ago. Whether the role has been big or small, on the big screen or small, my opinion is that he's always played very interesting characters.<br /><br />Once seen, Woods is very difficult to forget.<br /><br />Still, as much as I love me some legal drama, when I first heard about this TV series in 2006 a part of me thought - very snobbishly, I admit - that Woods' decision to do a TV series was a sign of his career as a movie actor being on the wane. I thought it would feel tired and desperate. As a consequence, even though I'd heard that the pilot was directed by Spike Lee, I didn't tune in to watch the series when it premiered here. Big mistake.<br /><br />I caught it around four or five episodes in - I was channel surfing and something - or someone - caught my eye. It could've been Henry Simmons. Whatever or whoever, after just a few minutes I was hooked.<br /><br />This fast-paced series has everything I love in a crime/courtroom drama. Woods, as LA maverick, &uuml;ber-prosecutor with a conscience Sebastian Stark, (who's just \\"hopped the fence\\" from the other side, i.e. defending criminals, by the way), is fast-talking, fast-thinking and is as slick as a pool of oil - but in a good way.<br /><br />The urban mayhem and legal wrangling were right up my street but I was also immediately drawn in by the underlying storyline involving Stark and his teenage daughter Julie, played by Danielle Panabaker. But it was when the show gave me one of the biggest sit-up-and-gape TV shocks of 2007 by killing off a major character, a character I'm sure everyone watching was growing to love, that I realised these people were serious. This was the real deal. I never missed another episode.<br /><br />Watching the entire season over on DVD has been a treat. Not only did I catch up on the episodes I missed, I also got the chance to review a scene if I didn't completely get it the first time round. Great performances all round, especially from Woods himself of course; from Jeri Ryan as his boss Jessica Delvin (the on-screen chemistry between her and Woods sizzles; the banter between their two characters is razor sharp, yet playful at the same time); from Simmons as cop-turned- prosecuting-investigator Isaac Wright and from Sam Page, Sophina Brown, Alexis Cruz and Sarah Carter as Woods' ADAs, Casey Woodland, Raina Troy, Martin Allende and Madeleine Poe respectively. A more dynamic legal team, I don't think I've ever seen on TV. This is what Dick Wolf's ill-fated \\"Conviction\\" wished it could've been. It's very much like \\"The Shield\\" but without the violence. There's no profanity either.<br /><br />If you enjoy courtroom drama, emotional drama, crime detection and all-round high-octane action with a sliver of politics thrown in, you can't afford to miss this 22-episode series. The season finale involving scenes with Stark and his daughter had me in floods of tears.<br /><br />DVD extras include audio commentary on selected episodes, a \\"Creating Shark\\" feaurette, gag reel and deleted scenes.<br /><br />This is brilliant TV. Highly recommended. Season two finally kicks of here this Friday. Guess who's going to be parked on the sofa come 10pm, cranberry juice in hand...hing the entire season over on DVD has been a treat.

B000002U94|5.0|The dominant view appears to be that Live Bullet is the better album.  I don't agree.  I've had both since they first came out and have always preferred Nine Tonight.  It has a better selection of songs and is performed with at least equal passion.  This is in my opinion the Bob Seger album to own if you were only to get one.  Its a better choice than the best ofs and while I agree that editing Let It Rock was stupid and unneccessary the album survives and thrives.  The only thing better was perhaps to have been there and as I live in Australia that was never an option.

0060935464|4.0|I recommend To Kill a Mockingbird on the basis that when searching for a good fictional piece to read, I think its necessary to find a complex story combined with articulate writing for it to remain engrossing.  Lee achieves this by offering a narrative filled with multiple story lines as well as frequently dealing with adult concepts depicted through the mind of a eight year old.<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird offers some consideration to the notion that the nature of one's choices does not necessarily encompass one's true worth.  To draw such a conclusion from the unbiased naivet&eacute; of a child is a mere example of the eloquent and perceptive nature of this book.<br /><br />I would recommend reading this book to anyone with an open mind and a sincere interest in human reflection.
B000O1799U|4.0|Anika had the feistiest character. I thought she was witty and interesting. I enjoyed this movie. I love music, especially that the 60s and 70s R&B flavor. Some say they thought there was too much singing. Well, it was based on a musical. This was a Moviecal, and much singing should have been expected, considering most of the actors/actresses were singers, including Jamie Foxx.     I give the movie 4 stars because of it's spirited plot, but I think there should have been more to Deena and Curtis's relationship. They seemed more like they worked together than husband and wife. And I lost respect for Deena when she stole her girlfriend's man. Well, at least the cast the right person (Beyonce) into that role. She does strike one as such. She's okay but her role could have had more fire. I well know that Beyonce could have pulled off a more interesting character than the low-keyed one they put her into. That's why I feel there should have been more substance to her relationship with Curtis (Jamie Foxx). When they finally broke up, she did nothing except packed her suitcase. Married people who are breaking up don't just do that. And they don't make up a song, nine to ten. No fanfare (other than the song \\"Listen\\") to their breaking up. Good Movie. I recommend owning this one.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What I noticed is that this show really seems to appeal to people who don't watch much TV (it seems like a lot of reviews here are written by people \\"who didn't even catch the show while it was on TV\\").  I am in this group for the same reason as most: TV shows are formulaic to the extreme, bland, and generally lacking of what makes real life real.  It's just this \\"realness\\" that Firefly manages to capture.  The \\"not every decision is black and white\\" kind of thing.  The \\"hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys\\" kind of thing.  The characters that you can identify with because they remind you of your best friend or whatever.  And the basic message that life is tough, there are consequences to your actions, but you can still find happiness amid the struggle.
B00133MKVK|5.0|Shirley is doing so well at 70 she hopefully will go on for at least another 20 years recording her magnificant voice with exceptional orchestrations.  How many 70 year olds can hold a candle to this woman?  Bravo, Shirley.
B00168HAOO|5.0|The whole \\"shakey video camera\\" effect is to make the movie feel/seem more realistic to the viewers.  Well the producers did just that!!  This is the most realistic monster/suspenseful movie I have ever seen!!  This is all about opinion.  Some people get dizzy watching the camera bounce around while the guy filming it is running for his life or he falls, and some people are ok with it.  I, myself was fine watching it.  Also in my opinion, we need to have more movies shot in this realistic camera type.  You ever see a movie and say oh my god, that was horrible, it looked so fake.  I have....but I didn't say that once this whole movie!  Awesome Awesome Awesome!!  Buy it!!  and buy the second one when it comes out. haha  Great movie!!
0756404746|5.0|This is a wonderfully rich book that deserves all the praise it has received.If you have enjoyed the works of Robert Silverberg(Lord Valentine's Castle) or Guy Gavriel Kay(A Song For Arbonne) and wish to be transported out of your everyday life and into a fully realized other world with all the sights and tastes and sounds that entails then by all means grab this novel.I would go on to say that anyone who would give this work one or two stars really is lacking in imagination because this book tells a fabulous  tale that is full of wisdom.
B000WMQGVI|5.0|I have read a lot of the so called quality books, and have a master's degree in the field, and I have found few books that had this kind of relevance to how things are produced and why they work or don't work. More importantly, this is one of the few 'academic studies' (I recall this one came out of MIT) that is actually clearly written and straightforward.    Yes, Toyota is much of the focus in this book and it can sometimes seem to border on the PR level, but that doesn't take away from the information in this book. Having had access to most of the auto manufacturers when this study was done, and seeing the nuts and bolts, it is what people do wrong at other places that is as important as what Toyota had been doing right (a trend, I might add, that in recent years has dimmed, Toyota has had embarassing quality faults recently). The book does mention that what Toyota \\"pioneered\\" was not entirely homegrown, many of the techniques existed, but Toyota was unique in the auto world in the number of things they chose to adopt (as a counterpoint, when the 70's hit and the US auto makers started having real competition, they hired Dr. Edwards Demming as a consultant, he told them many of the things that this book points out and they basically paid the check, used it for PR about how they were serious, and ignored him).     And these are not new issues and continue to plague companies, fallacies like:    1)\\"It is the fault of the labor force\\"..while the UAW has not exactly been cutting edge, what this book points out is something known in quality circles for years, that most of the problems are using your labor force badly, not listening to them, and just plain bad management.    2)\\"The secret is robotics\\"..GM under good ole Roger Smith spent umpteen billions of dollars on robots, and their cars were still crap (and even better, when GM and Toyota did a joint factory in California in around 1980, they discovered that the most hi tech thing in the plant was a secretary's typewriter)    3)\\"Cheap Labor\\"....nuff said about that    4)\\"We could build as good a car as them (meaning Toyota, Nissan, etc) if we built only a few models\\". Problem? Toyota had more product lines then any of the big 3 at the time.    5)\\"We have team labor\\".....on the surface, yes, but when looked at you find the same old hierarchical management and decisions made by beancounters.    There are a lot of lessons to be learned in this book, and some surprises (anyone wanna know why Benz bought Chrysler? Benz production capability is one of the lousiest in the world as written about in this book, and I hear it isn't much better today).     One of the things that this book teaches is that a lot of the cost of vehicles is based in bad design, poor management and in an attitude that problems, no matter how small, can be overlooked.  People are asking how developed countries can compete with third world labor, this tells how.
B0013POLS8|4.0|I've been a big fan of Mariah and own almost all of her video albums. This is by far, I believe, the most vivid live concert video available shot in widescreen and in HD. The concert is very entertaining and enjoyable. I watched it twice in a row as soon as I inserted this blu-ray. Mariah performs very well with all her great voice. To be honest, I expected she would have hard time singing songs with high notes because of her aging but I was wrong. In the concert, she proves she still can sing as before! I felt the concert was rather short even though it was 80 minutes long. I mean I wanted more! She could have sung more songs such as \\"Without You\\", \\"Emotions\\", \\"Love Takes Time\\", etc. It was great to see Boyz II Men and Mariah sing \\"One Sweet Day\\" together. Of course, Trey Lorenz, one of the back vocals of the concert, sings his part for \\"I'll Be There\\". Mariah, keep up the good work with your beautiful smile!    The concert itself deserves five stars but I have to take one off because of the clumsy production. Spotligting is not very accurate but most of all, camera work is, I would say, horrible! Firstly, you will see too much of audience shots in the latter part of the show. For example, when MC sings \\"Hero\\", almost half of the shots are done with audience. You will even remember some people in the audience after watching because of repetitious and long-staying zoom-ins. Who cares about audience that much? Who wants to miss the main performer instead? Secondly, there are many cases that a camera misses the hightlight of a song and the performer failing enhancing the mood of the song. For example, when MC sings with such high notes covering her ear (you know what I mean), the camera suddenly zoom out and shows the whole arena or people instead. In addition, there are some blurry/unfocused and pointless shots. So, I'm sure that the concert would have been much more enjoyable with a better production.    Technically, PQ is 4.5/5 (VC-1 coding) IMO and AQ is 5/5 withuncompressed PCM 5.1/2.0. Extras are good: I liked the Karaoke especially.
B00151HZME|4.0|As a follower of their work since [[ASIN:B0002IQB1W Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts]], I had high expectations for this M83 album. Though the sound is still there, there aren't the moving musical moments that one experienced in [[ASIN:B00070Q8HC Before the Dawn Heals Us]]. There is an inevitable New Order feel to many of the songs (\\"Couleurs\\" and \\"We Own The Sky\\" being two of them), but deep within this is M83 as we know it. It just isn't their best work so far.<br /><br />Some great tracks: \\"Kim & Jessie,\\" \\"Graveyard Girl,\\" \\"Highway Of Endless Dreams\\" and the closing track.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I loved this movie. I had listened to Daft Punk quite often, but never knew that such a movie existed. I just got the DVD a few weeks ago and have already watched it several times. If you are a fan of Daft Punk and Anime you're sure to love this movie.     Menus are so-so. The extra stuff was a little hard to navigate. Other than those minor things, I have nothing to complain about.
0143038419|3.0|This book was recommended by a friend in Chicago, a psychologist who is still working on finding herself after a traumatic life experience.  The thing that make the reading the book worthwhile for me was the author's wit and keen sense of humor.  Her endless effort to achieve inner peace and to come to terms with her destructive feelings while traveling around the world got to be a bit tedious at times, especially in Bali near the end of the book. The author once again recounted yet another healing experience, this time during her first trip to Bali as a magazine writer, when she went into hermit-like isolation on an island.  This seemed a repetition of the same kind of experience she had later on a rooftop in her ashram in India.  She lost me with so much introspection and communing with her inner self, but I was near the end of the book so I kept on reading to the end.  From a YouTube video of her in a book talk I gathered that she ended up marrying the man she met in Bali who renewed her faith in love and sex and if that relationship doesn't work she can always travel to places that begin with another letter of the alphabet and renew her healing process again. . . and write another book about it.
B0014CQNTK|5.0|This universally enjoyable film, like all the greats, will leave you with that \\"ahhhh\\" feeling once it is over.  It is not over-long (a recent trend with popular movies) and the story is quite simply well told, both through the amazing cinematography and the witty dialogue that snaps, crackles, and pops across the screen.    Whether you're in it for the heartwarming story, the witty one-(or two or three)liners, or just looking for something different to watch, I suggest you stop searching right now and settle on \\"Juno.\\"  It's one of those films that will leave you with that odd feeling of wanting more, yet satisfaction with the completed story it tells.  And so far, I've only talked about the writing and the direction.  The cast is great, starring the fresh-face of Ellen Page, who captures the essence of Juno's character perfectly.  Her voice, her gestures, and even the way she walks are all a part of crafting this character, and Ellen Page has done a spectacular job.  The rest of the cast, Michael Cerra (of [[ASIN:B000WZEZGI Superbad]] fame) and [[ASIN:B000H5V8DG Alias's]] Jennifer Garner are all wonderful in this film.  Also, I can't finish off this review without saying how hilarious Olivia Thirlby is as Juno's best friend, Leah.    If this review seems like gushing praise, I suggest you contest what I'm saying and give Juno a try.  If you don't return praising the movie as much as I have, then... Then you simply did not see the same movie.  \\"Juno\\" is the movie of the year, without a doubt.    10/10 Classic.
0060090383|4.0|This was the first book I read by Keyes, and I intend to read them all!  Actually, it's a wonder that I haven't stumbled across her sooner.  Rachel's Holiday was a great book.  Although a bit lengthy at times, it was worth the sometimes slow page-turning.  In the end, I would prefer a longer, much more thoroughly developed story, than a quick \\"this happened overnight\\" storyline anyway.  You follow Rachel's journey through her experience at the Cloisters - a rehab facility - as well as the time following her release.  She gives addiction a face - a face of a seemingly normal young adult experiencing life and having fun - and not being able to differentiate between \\"having fun\\" and \\"having a problem\\".  Everyone in her life can see that she is an addict, except her.  Anyone who is/has ever experienced having ANY type of vice or addiction could relate to Rachel and her journey/struggle...  The decisions she must face once she gets out of rehab, the constant struggle to stay sober, rebuilding broken relationships, rebuilding her life, starting from scratch...   You really feel as if you get a deeper understanding for addiction and addicts as you follow Rachel.  You will find yourself rooting her on - and hoping she doesn't relapse!  Characters are well-developed and realistic.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for chick lit a little more deeper and beyond Prada and Hollywood..
B0009353IW|4.0|That's CHA-vez. Just as he provided a venue for aging Cubans before they were gone and forgotten, Cooder, in 15 songs, shines a light on the unknown tale of how a dusty hillside Los Angeles Mexican neighborhood known as Chavez Ravine was razed in the 1950s in a \\"greasy handoff\\" to the newly arrived Dodgers baseball team. Think of the movie Chinatown. Crooked red-baiting right wing politicos, innocent citizens believing \\"it can't happen here,\\" cool cats being beaten up by GIs, and a UFO-driving Space Vato (space guy) who recognizes the Ravine as the hip place to land; these are the players in Cooder's loving 21st century concept album.<br /><br />The beautifully packaged Nonesuch CD includes a booklet worthy of a very small coffee table. The record has a handmade, non-digital feel with an airy sound that hints at L.A.'s El Hoyo Club in 1955. The record's opening track, \\"Poor Man's Paradise,\\" is driven by Cooder's clean guitar and jazzy harmonies; \\"El UFO Cayo\\" is a slow, dreamy, late night swirl of guitars. \\"Muy Fifi\\" rocks with a thumping bass under L.A. legend Ersi Arvizu's gutsy vocals. \\"3rd Base Dodger Stadium,\\" a lovely lament sung beautifully by Hawaiian singer Bla Pahinui, recounts how former residents of Chavez Ravine can pinpoint where their own home plate used to be. We should all be so lucky.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm one of those who saw the movie \\"Serenity,\\" got curious about the Television show, then watched each of the 14 TV episodes.  This show was obviously genre-bending, combining sci-fi with a Western feel, which is probably why it was cancelled: it couldn't be pidgeon-holed by (or for) a network executive.  But it's uniqueness, you might even say its quirkiness, is part of its charm.<br /><br />Another thing that might have contributed to its demise was its inability to maintain a consistent tone.  Sometimes, the sensuality and violence are way down low at \\"family hour\\" levels, even unrealistically low, whereas other episodes were strictly adults-only fare. Ironically, however, the two most extreme episodes were after the show was already cancelled: the second to last show \\"Hearts of Gold,\\" about rescuing the whorehouse baby, was over-the-top in its sexuality; the last, never-aired episode, \\"Objects in Space\\", where the bounty hunter boards the ship, had a level of menace and violence absent in other episodes, even the episode where Mal and Wash are tortured.<br /><br />Unpredictability is always risky in a TV show, where people tune in every week to get same sort of entertainment.  This show was unpredictable from the start, which, again, was part of its charm.
0452286751|1.0|This book has nothing to recommend it - -  it's silly and contrived, the characters are melodramatic and predictable and mostly lacking in what the rest of us call \\"humanity.\\"  The dialogue is just beyond awful.  Think about a really bad movie from the 1940s and you're getting there.    I decided to read this after reading Tobias Wolfe's novel \\"Old School,\\" in which he inserts Rand and her writing into the plot of the book.   What he does with her and her goofy thinking is good fun.    To me the most interesting and fun part of this is the way in which the Ayn Rand followers, like all non-conformists, end up being conformists of the highest order (think of all of those ladies in red dresses and purple hats that you see on tour buses -- this is who I'm talking about).  Rand rails against the masses and the bad taste of the public and, ironically, it's this public who embrace her work.  Additionally, if she really feels that none of us should care what anyone else thinks, why did she bother to write a novel to impose her thinking on the rest of us?      My advice is, don't waste your time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I ordered this and received it last week. I did it 3 times at level one in addition to 20 minutes high resistance on the elliptical. I was already starting to notice a difference...but then I got sick. I am hoping to get back at it by the end of the week. I don't weigh myself but after 3 times I noticed a difference. I think the key to the success is the circuit style set-up. On level one I actually find the first circuit the most difficult (I hate push-ups) but by the cardio on the third circuit I feel totally energized. I cannot wait to do levels two and three. For now my goal is to spend about 10 days at each level since I only workout 3-4x a week usually. This DVD is fun and motivating!
B0013FXWU6|3.0|...this is my least favorite Paul Thomas Anderson film (his others which were far, far better: Punch Drunk Love, Magnolia, Boogie Nights).  Technically, it's superb: cinematography, the always-stellar acting of Daniel Day Lewis, score, script, film editing, etc.  However it starts off VERY slow (no dialogue for first ten minutes) and never really picks up because the film is mainly a character study of the workaholic and rapacious oilman Daniel Plainview that DDL plays, yet without any clear antagonists or dramatic tension, other than Eli Sunday, a creepy small-town farmboy-cum-preacher who makes a series of feeble attempts to grab his own piece of the pie, and Plainview's adopted son HW who later becomes estranged from him.<br /><br />Due in large part to the title and to watching Plainview's ruthlessness and greed, I kept thinking this was going to be one of those \\"chickens coming home to roost\\" karmic tragedies where you see the main character build himself up obsessively and then, through his own inherent flaws, fall apart at the end.  Instead, Plainview merely plateaus into a kind of deeply entrenched and isolated state of evil by the end---still dominant and a bit more twisted and violent than before, but now an eccentric recluse sort of like Howard Hughes.<br /><br />After some thought it was clear to me that Anderson has made what is more or less a \\"message movie\\" very much in the spirit of Upton Sinclair: a full frontal assault on the two most cherished myths in American history---namely, that of the capitalist entrepreneur \\"self-made man,\\" and of the church being a moral beacon and pillar of the community.  This film provides a blistering counterpoint: Daniel Plainview the oilman is a heartless, obsessive, one-dimensional workaholic who has neither scruples nor humanity; Eli Sunday the charismatic but hypocritical small-town preacher is equally ambitious, manipulative and ruthless but is at heart impotent and pathetic whenever confronted by Plainview directly, and finally destroyed (literally and figuratively) by Plainview at the end.  In other words, we are presented with a very dark vision of business making religion its whore, as much as religion wants to milk business but is too inept to succeed.  Plainview, as the embodiment of small entrepreneur allowed to grow into large scale industrial tycoon, is simply a psychotic beast who eats Sunday for lunch, right along with all the gullible, weak and passive common people (like Sunday's congregation, whose land he swindles from them) whom Plainview systematically deceives and exploits to make his fortune from though they imagine that they are following Sunday.<br /><br />As Phillip Roth wrote in The Human Stain, \\"Human history is a story of the ruthless and the defenseless.\\"<br /><br />This is a subtle and hard to dispute social-historical analysis, which Anderson's film unfortunately does not do a very good job of communicating clear, in no small part because of how slow and monochromatic it is.ly destroyed (literally and figuratively) by Plainview at the end.

B000AP04MO|3.0|This is a movie that has suffered the onslaught of time. I believe it was probably seen as avant garde when it came out but now it feels dated.<br />The performances are fine but the actual story has lost a lot of its bite because of changing moral values. Maybe this was one of the movies that ushered the change?
B000VNMMQ6|4.0|Known in Australia as \\"Die Hard 4.0\\" this is an excellent movie and a worthy addition to the Die Hard series.<br /><br />But be warned - the same chimpanzee that threw the camera around wildly from time to time in The Bourne Ultimatum has been hired for some shots in this movie too. Sometimes the camera is jerking around so aimlessly that it may not only confuse your sense of what is happening story-wise, it may cause nausea and motion sickness. This is purely moments of crazy camera work that snuck by the editor (or looked cool on a tiny editing screen?) - the movie overall is great!

0743298039|4.0|The Thirteenth Tale revolves around Margaret Lea, a book collector's daughter who works in the family bookstore and occasionally writes biographies. Margaret is summoned out of the blue by world famous author Vida Winter to write her biography. Until then, Vida's true life story had been a carefully guarded secret of great public interest. Vida quickly draws Margaret and the reader in with her suspenseful story full of scandal, murder and intrigue. Diane Setterfield does a wonderful job of setting the dark, gothic tone of the novel and introducing many twists and turns that I did not see coming. I would have given this book a much higher rating had it not been for the sub-plot regarding Margaret's obsession over a twin that died at birth. I found the story line a detraction from an otherwise decent book. Other than the sub-plot, an entertaining and quick read.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am a 25 yr old mom of two that's ready to get back into shape.  I've had my ups and downs with working out in the past 4 yrs, but I'm ready to be lean and shredded!  I got my DVD yesterday, and it was simple to fit in 20 mins. of exercise even despite having my two children alone at nights.  My 3 yr old wanted to work out with my and I love that I'm setting a good example.  All you need are hand weights and a mat, or a softer surface.  I'm not the type to push myself and I felt like Jillian motivated me to do so.  It's just 20 mins. but I felt the burn and I'm sore today!  Which is great!  I felt like I got a great workout, and I will push myself to work harder each day (she recommends doing it every day to see the best results in the shortest time) but I didn't feel overwhelmed and it moved so quickly that I kept thinking, \\"I can do this!  It's not much longer!\\"  Thanks Jillian!!
0679731725|5.0|A wonderful read. I sought this book out after thoroughly enjoying Never Let Me Go. Ishiguro is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. Stevens, a loyal and dedicated butler serving Lord Darlington for more than 30 years in one of England's grand houses, looks back on his life and years of service on a motoring trip across England with the ultimate goal of visiting Miss Kenton, a former maid at Darlington Hall, under the auspice of a business trip to help alleviate staffing issues. As the story unfolds, Stevens examines the meaning of \\"dignity\\" and the true character of his former employer, a Nazi sympathizer before WWII. Also evident are Stevens' missed opportunities and sacrifices made in order to be a \\"great butler\\"; in particular, the failure to act on his true feelings for Miss Kenton. Heartbreaking and thought provoking. I have not yet seen the movie, but am eager to see the portrayals of Stevens by Anthony Hopkins and Miss Kenton by Emma Thompson.
B0015KO52S|5.0|I am not a huge White Stripes fan, but I absolutely LOVE the Raconteurs songs.  This album is a worthy follow up to Broken Boy Soldiers.  I think the songs are a bit more complex and may not be as radio friendly as the songs were on their previous cd.  That being said, just like their debut cd this one great song after great song.  Amazing how they are able to blend sound from the past with their own twists.  A bit more White Stripes sound on this album that had virtually none in Broken Boy Soldiers. If you like classic rock, buy this cd. If you like the White Stripes, buy this cd....Buy this cd and Broken Boy Soldiers.
0930289234|5.0|I can remeber it all so clearly, picking up \\"Watchmen\\" for the first time in the late 80's...shortly after devouring Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Night Returns\\".<br /><br />The Watchmen treats us all like adults, and gives us the depth, detail, artistry, and excellence that defines the benchmark in the genre.  This is high art and a literary masterpiece - if you are newbie, this is simply not to be missed.<br /><br />I own the original series, the softcover collection, and the Absolute edition.  My kids will read it when they are old enough.

The Amazon reviews encouraged me to purchase ,& I'm so glad I did!

B00005J6T0|5.0|This album is magical and pure genius. With this album madonna became the biggest star in the world and has remained that way ever since. She is the greatest and most talented artist in the business not to mention the smartest and the one with the most staying power. The songs Live to tell, Papa don't preach, Open your heart, La isla bonita, and true blue are considered classic 20 years later especially now with this remastered version. EXCELLENT madonna.
B0010358CQ|5.0|Wow, I have got to come down hard on the side that believes this is better than the (2004?) remake.    My history with this series goes back to the late 80's when the Manga came over to the USA, and then the original OVA joined from Japan. These two remakes/reimagings are quite different from the original but carry the spirit and philosophical ponderings of Masamune Shirow with them as well.    My thoughts: Appleseed (remake), the predecessor to Ex Machina had some stunning visuals however the combination of 2D and 3D art did not mesh for me. I had to get used to the downplay of philosophical/racial/political questioning which took a back seat to the action. The overall \\"scope\\" of the story seemed to have been collapsed.     Ex Machina (The DVD here) brought back the original's heady themes, uses a cohesive art style, and has the best characterizations of the three main characters (one of which is new). We don't quite get enough of a view into their lives, but their relationships with each other are nicely developed. This will hopefully lead to a nice continuation in the third movie.    For those who like to have something to think about, the politics are amped up in this installment and feel quite contemporary with current security states and the modern shifting boundaries between freedom in society and security.    For those who like action, there is plenty as well, including (fashionably?) zombie-likes, John Woo influenced choreography and Matrix-inspired scenes.    I highly recommend this DVD, and that means something coming from this jaded Anime and Manga fan. I can't wait for the next installment.    A side note: there is lots of shooting, but virtually no blood or gore and the language steers clear from offensiveness and foul words in the English dub. Even the dub is one of the better-quality dubs I've come across though I always recommend rewatching with the original Japanese language track and English subtitles.    5 stars from me, and hopefully not exaggerated due to my disappointment of the previous remake. I feel this is a worthy successor to the original story from the late 80's.

B0011HOEY4|4.0|It is a generally accepted fact that organized crime has been and always will be an amazingly lucrative and profit driven enterprise that seeks new and innovative ways to do just one thing: impact positively the bottom line. The money that is garnered through different organized crime ventures whether they be of an illegal gambling nature or a drug trafficking nature is really the main reason as to why in fact in some ways crime does indeed pay.<br /><br />Though it is a sad commentary on not just our current society but rather upon human civilization, crime has always been focused more on making as much money as possible and by whatever means might be necessary to get there. New York City in the 1970's was really no different.<br /><br />Directed by Ridley Scott, American Gangster tells the story of a true life drug kingpin by the name of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington). Though Lucas might not seem to necessarily fit the mold of what we would traditionally think a drug dealer to be, what Lucas has done is create an entire drug enterprise for which he predominantly serves in a sort of CEO position of the drug trade.<br /><br />When Lucas' mentor Bumpy Johnson passes away, Lucas is given the keys to the streets of Harlem and is on his way to serving as a man of the people to the junkies and casual users alike. He quickly makes it known that he is now the man in charge on the streets of Harlem and that his goods are the products that will be sold to the people of his streets.<br /><br />\\"I got Harlem, I took care of Harlem so Harlem's gonna take care of me,\\" stated Frank Lucas showing that he knew that his support amongst those around him was exponentially stronger than anyone might initially imagine. The fear and esteem that Lucas was able to instill in those around him simultaneously is what truly helped Lucas strive.<br /><br />Like any good businessman, Lucas needs to ensure that he provides for his customer base a product that is worthy of repeating business with him thereby building a committed group of customers that yearn solely for his product. Lucas reaches out to Vietnam and becomes an importer of Blue Magic, a heroin that is basically about as pure as it can get. The Blue Magic takes the addicts of Harlem by the throat and quickly Lucas' product becomes the talk of the town and the drug of choice.<br /><br />However, when crime begins to spiral out of control you can rest assured that the police and powers that be are not far behind. However, due to rampant conspiracies and episodes of police being on the take, the larger population of police in the NYPD drug units seem to not concern themselves much with what is taking place in Harlem.<br /><br />When Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is assigned to spearhead a federal taskforce on the drugs in the Harlem area, Roberts takes his assignment far more serious than some of his previous counterparts. Roberts, who is attending night school to become an attorney, makes it his passion to hunt down those that are poisoning and killing so many people in the Harlem area. Though they knew who the everyday small players were involved in the operation, no one knew the magnitude to which Lucas played a role in the drug trade mainly because he flew under the radar.<br /><br />The film documents the entire tracking down of Lucas and the subsequent court proceedings that both he and Roberts were a part of. The film serves as a good cop gets bad guy kind of movie and there are decent action scenes throughout the film that help serve as an added bonus to the film.<br /><br />What American Gangster was able to do is show the viewers the amount of calculation and precision that went into the 1970's drug market in Harlem. Often times we are quick to imagine the strung out junkie on the corner passing a bag in exchange for ten dollars to another junkie but we do not think of the larger, more businesslike approach that people like Lucas bring to the entire drug culture.<br /><br />Overall, American Gangster was a very well done film with two excellent actors portraying each of their roles in an accurate and precise way. The story behind the film is an interesting yet not utterly unique story but the way in which the actual facts were translated into this film was done so in a very professional and well thought out way.portraying each of their roles in an accurate and precise way.

B000U7169M|4.0|A supernatural/otherworldy 'good vs. evil' horror movie in the general vein of [[ASIN:B000BTJDGC The Exorcism of Emily Rose - Unrated (Special Edition)]][[ASIN:B000HEWEGC The Exorcist - The Complete Anthology (The Exorcist/ The Exorcist- Unrated/ The Exorcist II: The Heretic/ The Exorcist III/ The Exorcist: The Beginning/ The Exorcist: Dominion)]], \\"The Reaping\\" is an underated film, not as scary as 'Exorcist' or 'Emily Rose' but very good nonetheless, nowhere near as campy as its critics say.  Its style moves closer at times to suspense thrillers than other movies of its type, and may open it up to be enjoyed by fans of that kind of movie as well as by horror fans.       Hillary Swank plays a former Christian aid worker turned ardent atheist; teaching at a university she now specializes in 'debunking' miracles and other paranormal phenomena.  Having achieved some not in certain academic circles, she's contacted by a man on behalf of a small Southern bayou town where a host of ominous and apparantly supernatural events are taking place.  Tensions are running high in the community, and the mayor and his colleagues really want for somebody to come in, find a scientific explanation for everything, and hopefully calm the townspeople down, some of whom are starting to think about taking matters into their own hands.  What's happening in this little rural corner appears to be nothing less than the ten Biblical plagues re-occuring, and bearing the blame for this is a little girl who lives off in the swamp with her mother, and is believed by some to be evil incarnate.  Some are starting to fear that townspeople's anxieties are running so high that the little girl's life may be in danger.         Once Swank's character and her assistant are in town, the phenomena quickly prove to be more difficult to discredit than other events the two have investigated.  And eventually it starts to come out that there may be even more to the story than what they've been told.  There are some good twists towards the end; some of them are actually surprising, and beyond that, they're quite affecting on other levels too.  There's a good mix of characters you like right off the bat, ones you dislike right off the bat, and ones you have mixed feelings about right from the start.  The cast does a good job with their roles and the story is well told with a good interplay of different angles and elements; one area that could have admittedly used some improvement was the special effects, but these only play a major role during a couple of the movie's scenes.  Definately better than its reputation, and fans of Exorcist, Omen and Exorism Of Emily Rose should really make it a point to see this one.  8.5 out of 10

B000E33VWW|5.0|Okay, so there is no denying the fact that Philip Seymour Hoffman nailed his performance as Truman Capote; he has the Oscar to prove it; but what I adore so much about `Capote' is that it never rests heavy on the shoulders of one man.  It never once allows the magnitude of Hoffman's performance remain the only redeeming factor of the film.  The script, the direction, the supporting actors, the score, the cinematography; everything is top notch and just as memorable as the lead performance.  In fact, the best thing about this movie is the masterful direction from Bennett Miller (who should have won the Oscar in my opinion).<br /><br />`Capote' catalogs the journey author Truman Capote took in order to pen his last completed `novel'; `In Cold Blood'.  `In Cold Blood' was the first `non-fiction novel'; based on the harrowing Clutter family murders; and proved to make Capote a household name.  Despite this great achievement, the experience took its toll on Truman and reduced him to a mere shell of his former self.<br /><br />Miller shoots the film in a very distilled and serene manner; creating a true sense of lucid menacing.  The film is shot in muted tones, the coloring dull; the voices almost hushed and this adds so many layers to the mood of the film.  Mychael Danna's score is yet another masterful facet of the film; its fragile, almost brittle piano strings playing perfect compliment to the grace of the film.  Adam Kimmel beautifully constructs the films cinematography, creating an eerie vibe that permeates each and every scene.  The gritty construction of the garments worn; the broken down and haunting way the sets were designed; everything about this film complemented one another brilliantly.<br /><br />`Capote' is the type of film I refer to as a `mood' film, for it relays a certain emotion so well you can't help but succumb to its advances.<br /><br />As the film follows Truman Capote; making his way to Kansas, investigating the horrible crime, interviewing the locals, familiarizing himself with the accused; we sense his obsession and his overall selfish desires that deride any and all good that could have come from this adventure.  `Capote' does a standup job of fleshing out the man that is Truman Capote, making him very real to us and exposing him for who he truly was; a man self concerned and manipulative.  His relationships are bare and open for the viewer, which helps shed a light on his somewhat ambiguous actions.  His motives may not always appear clear, for he was a very subtle yet conniving man; but with a keen eye one begins to understand and comprehend just what this man was all about.<br /><br />So now we've come to the acting.  Yes, Philip Seymour Hoffman was astonishing; utterly phenomenal.  His performance gets better and better for me each and every time I watch the film.  The way he says so much with the blank stare; the expressionless face that pierces through the audience and sings like a bird.  There is a scene, probably my favorite scene in the film, where Capote visits the morgue.  His face, that stagnant expression as he lifts the mother's coffin lid and pears in at the body, is priceless.  While I still feel that Heath Ledgers monumental achievement in `Brokeback Mountain' was superior work, I can't really complain about Hoffman's Oscar win; he truly was amazing here.<br /><br />But Hoffman is not the only one.<br /><br />Catherine Keener received a lot of attention for her subtle supporting role as Nelle Harper Lee.  She really develops her character nicely; but like everyone else on the screen, she falls into the background whenever Hoffman is on the screen.  Chris Cooper turns in a very fine performance as well as Bruce Greenwood; but it is Clifton Collins Jr., the accused, who is able to hold his own against Hoffman.  As Perry Smith, the murderer for whom Capote strikes an oddly perverse relationship, Clifton is able to really get under this mans skin, into his mind and formulate his every action.  It's a superb performance that sadly went underappreciated.<br /><br />In closing I just want to say that `Capote' is a superbly crafted gem of a film; a biopic that fleshes out its characters and delivers a masterful impression on the audience.  Miller is a marvelous director who captures the heart and soul of his subject; taking many risks in his portrayal and never condescending to sugarcoat or mask over the important details.  When we read Capote's words at the end of the film; \\"More tears are shed for answered prayers than unanswered ones\\"; we are shell-shocked with savage grief because we know those words to be true.  The entire film is haunting, chilling even, and the aftereffect is one that will stay with you long after the film has ended.reciated.

B0007OY2P8|2.0|This movie was directed in a very weird fashion. The characters were awkward and the lines seemed cheesy. The weirdest part of all was the music, which was very much modern and not of the time period of the story. This pretty much ruins movies for me. I really enjoy this story though. But there is a newer 2007 version which I think does a much better job of telling the story and making you fall in love with the characters. Plus, the music is very fitting.
B00003CXD5|5.0|Now this is how you are supposed to treat a film classic!  This DVD version of an all-time classic film that has a great storyline, excellent acting and compelling drama to the very end has been restored very well here and although there are still a few picture quality imperfections at some spots, overall, the restoration has been very well done.  The only thing I would have liked to have seen is an audio option included that would allow for at least Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround or DTS/THX quality in addition to just the Dolby Digital Mono quality here which as far as Mono goes is very well remastered.<br /><br />The mostly cardboard digipak packaging is also very well put together making me wish all dvds would be packaged in this way as well.  This DVD represents great value for money as well as we get excellent bonus features on both discs and the best one of all is the 2 hour-long documentary on the life of John Huston.  I enjoyed that documentary almost as much as the movie itself and I also appreciated the Bugs Bunny cartoons and the other documentary on the making of the film as well.<br /><br />Until perhaps an even better restored version on Blu-Ray comes around, this here is the best version of the film that you can get.  I thought this is Bogie's best ever performance and yet he pales in comparison with that of Walter Huston who put in among the best 5 performances that I've ever seen by a male actor.  John Huston the director also shows that he's a good actor with his small part at the start of the film.  Even the small boy selling lottery tickets was excellent and I can't think of any bad acting at all among any of the cast.<br /><br />This film fully deserves its top 30 ranking among AFI's Best American Films list.  The story of how Bogie's honorable character degenerates because of greed to the horrible lowlife that he became in the end as compared to what became of his companions is a study in great story-telling and great acting.  You start out liking Bogie but end up totally hating his guts at the end.  If that's not great acting, I don't know what is.<br /><br />Excellent film, great extras, great value for money, excellent dvd makes this highly recommended!<br /><br />Updated 20 April 2011:<br /><br />Amazon won't let me review this separately and so I've added this on.  The Blu-Ray version is excellent and is a marked improvement over the dvd.  Both the picture quality except for a few frames at the Cody scene and the sound quality are excellent and a vast improvement over the dvd as well.  The blu-ray is now the definitive version of this film and I'm astounded at just how much better it is over the dvd version that I've reviewed above.<br /><br />Blu-ray version is very highly recommended!otally hating his guts at the end.

B000FFJ85I|4.0|Like a gourmet meal, I found flavors of Depeche Mode, The Cure, and Slayer within, with maybe just a splash of Green Day for fun. I know that may sound like it may not go together, but who was the first one to think that chocolate and strawberries would? It's fresh, but still with a pang of nostalgia for those of us that lived in the fullness of variety that the 80s  had to offer. Quite worth a listen.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|The original in the Jesse Stone movie series.  The best of all.  It is gripping drama.  Tom Selleck is at his best in this story about a tormented cop.
B000TGGJKK|5.0|I was fan of Troy when it was first released a few years ago but it seemed a bit rushed and lacking any depth. Wait no more!! This directors cut is great and really takes the movie to another level. Improved Score, Improved Pacing and not to mention the extended gory fight scenes!!! I loved the way they cleaned up the special effects and fleshed out characters so much more!! 5 outa 5!!
0316067598|5.0|Half of this book explains the Seals training and gives the author's point of view on Rules of Engagement, Media, liberal ideas, the family and the bond between seals. He is a conservative person with clear ideas. The second part of the book plunges the reader in the tragic events that took place in june 2005 on the Hindu kush mountains in Afghanistan where a 4 men platoon of Seals was destroyed after an epic resistance against dozens of talibans. The writing is easy and enticing and you can't stop reading until you finish the book. I would recommend this book to a friend even though the patriotic tones sometimes are really politically UNcorrect and may not be adequate to a lefty reader.
B00133KFGW|4.0|Great movie. I loved the love story aspect between man and woman, mother and son, boy and the world of music, all the musical ties to each character were wonderful. Freddie Highmore was amazing as Evan/August. The whole story was really good, and I couldn't wait for the big finish. I think the ending could have been done a little better as far as Lyla and Louis's roles being given more of a finish, but all in all it was satisfying.

B000059H9E|2.0|I really don't know how so many people love this film.  I just watched it and it is by far Almodovar's worst film.    My biggest problem with the film is that he does not build the characters AT ALL!  Why did Helena do what she did?  Was she guilty or bored?  I gues I can make my own back story to fill in the HUGE gaps in the film but in this one he is asking a lot.    Does not stand up to Talk to Her, High Heels, Women on the Verge..., or any of his other great films.
0765357151|4.0|I Am Legend is Richard Matheson's short novel about the only survivor of a plague that has made everyone else on earth into something like zombie vampires. It is a foundational novel in the post-apocalyptic genre of science fiction and horror, and has been made into a movie three times: The Last Man on Earth (1964), with Vincent Price, The Omega Man (1971), with Charlton Heston, and I Am Legend (2007), with Will Smith. Of these, The Last Man on Earth follows the novel most closely.<br /><br />Matheson's style often seizes on the mundane details of the situation, at times without apparent value to the story, but the overall effect is suspenseful, in large part because Matheson takes the reader inside the main character Neville's mental imbalance. Throughout the book, Neville is not only in danger from the vampires, but also from himself.<br /><br />This edition contains ten Matheson short stories, ranging in genre from horror to suspense. None of them are as good as I Am Legend, but a few of them are genuinely creepy and others show Matheson's knack for exploring the disturbed minds of his characters. The reader will also notice a few of Matheson's writing preferences (he loves to use the word \\"funereal\\", and he frequently describes characters' mouths as \\"gashes\\").<br /><br />Like or not, books like I Am Legend are responsible for the now over-played zombie genre. Here, at least, it's done originally, and done well.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED
B000MTPANQ|5.0|No mind bending long winded review here just the facts.  Classic solo NY that all NY fans and most folk/country rock fans can't do without.  If you get this then spend the extra 5-6 bucks for the DVD/CD version, it is pretty cool and the sound is great.  I hope Neil puts out that long long over due box set soon, none of us are getting any younger including Neil.  Either way this is great stuff and please put out more of it Neil.  With all the garbage in music today many of us long for classic unreleased stuff from the classic rock era (mid to late 60s - early to mid 70s).  Also don't forget the Live at the Fillmore with Crazy Horse DVD/CD version is also very nice.  Rock on Neil.

B00104QSOM|1.0|Definitely one of the best films of 2007, and, with repeated viewing, quickly becoming one of my favorite movies.  Everything about the film is expertly crafted.  I wish the same effort was put into the DVD release.  When I picked the box out of the mail and ripped the cardboard off I was disgusted with what I found.  A flimsy paper box with slits cut in the side to slide the DVD's into.  No protection at all. In fact the case serves to actually damage the product.  And this is the collector's edition!  I have never been more disappointed with a DVD in my life.  I feel like I've been swindled.
B00154GEFU|5.0|When I learned that the original Asia was releasing a new album, I was struck with the thought that, yes, this was an  event I never thought would happen, but at the same time this was an event ripe for a big let down. I will admit I have been a fan of Asia since 1982 and loved the first two albums (yes, I love the Alpha album, what of it?) I am also a fan of the Astra group, as well as the Live in Moscow 1990 Pat Thrall version of the band. I guess what I'm trying to say is John Wetton is the voice of Asia, and as long as his voice is there it will always be Asia.   This takes nothing away from Howe, Palmer or Downes. I only said Wetton is the voice of Asia, not the complete sound. Well, Asia did release a new album, and it's a wonderous thing. John Wetton is singing better than ever, and all four are playing with a unity and strength I thought I'd never hear again. Sleeping Giant/No Way Back/Reprise and Parallel Worlds/Vortex/Deya have to be two of the greatest pieces of music they have ever created. If you've followed John Wetton's ups and downs these past few years, the song An Extraordinary Life will have more meaning.  Steve Howe has written two great songs for this album as well. Wish I'd Known All Along and Over and Over are top-flight songs and show why Howe's complaint of not having any songs on Alpha is justified. Everyone is playing well, Wetton is singing well, and the song selection is just great. The original Asia has released a new album. Life is good.
B000VECAC6|5.0|For those of you who don't dig, or simply haven't been exposed to, the Monty Python crew's brand of offbeat british humor, \\"The Life of Brian\\" may just win you over.  This is by far this ensemble's greatest film, easily surpassing \\"The Holy Grail\\" in terms of comedic punch and social relevance.      This Blu-ray edition is, hands down, the best presentation of this film to date.  Sony continues it's great track record of releasing pristine transfers of catalog titles.  With the exception of some noisy video in a few dark scenes, particularly the scene where Brian is confronted by a centurion versed in the intricacies of Latin grammar, this film looks flawless.  It's always amazing to me how much detail can be squeezed out of standard def quality film, especially in Brian's case since the movie is nearly 20 years old.  Color reproduction is great, black levels and contrast are deep and stable respectively, and fine detail is unbelievable.   In short, this Blu-ray disc is perfect, and for only 20 bucks at Amazon, you really can't beat the price.    This disc comes packed with special features including; two commentary tracks, deleted scenes, a \\"behind the scenes\\" type look at Brian, and a host of subtitle options (22 in total if you can believe it).  For fans of the film, this is simply a must-have.    \\"The Life of Brian\\" was controversial upon its release because it allegedly mocked Christian doctrine.  As a result it has never quite enjoyed the mainstream success of other Python flicks.  For me this is by far the Python's most solid film, entertaining and thought provoking, Brian accomplishes everything a great film should.  Only Kevin Smith's \\"Dogma\\" comes close to matching it in terms of tackling difficult issues, but where \\"Dogma\\" falls short of greatness due to Smith's sometimes heavy-handed dialogue, Brian truly shines.  If you haven't seen it yet for whatever reason, but particularly if you feel that it may insult your faith, please check it out.  This movie isn't in any way an indictment of Christianity, but instead a thoughtful and hilarious examination of dogma and the zealots who are so quick to cast judgment on their fellow man.  Simply put, this film is perfect, and this is the definitive version of an already superb film.
B0012F90NK|5.0|One of those albums that, for most Yes enthusiasts, fell between the cracks. After the transcendent Close to the Edge, a lot of people (including myself) found Tales from Topographic Oceans...less than impressive. (Jon Anderson, in an interview, admitted that he and Steve Howe basically got all \\"inspired\\" together when coming up with the songs and the concept, and they, primarily he, pushed it on the rest of the band. Wakeman hated the album and left the band shortly after). Relayer was a complete 180 degree change, a total collaboration of all band members with none of the new-agey softness of Tales - it's much more hard-edged, never boring, filled with musically innovative twists and turns. Patrick Moraz's keyboard parts are inspired, Steve Howe displays new brilliance as a guitarist...really, each of the members' talents are displayed to their maximum, and the sum total is brilliant Yes.     The digital remix is great - in the original mix, there were parts in The Gates of Delirium where distortion creeped in that's gone now. This mix is clear, undistorted - you can hear things that you couldn't hear before. The album also contains a raw studio runthrough of Gates of Delirium which is interesting to hear; clearly the song went much farther before they made the final mix, so you get to see the structure of the song without many of the ornaments.
B0014DFCMS|4.0|First, this is the best version, in terms of video quality, of Juno available.  Sadly for fans of the flick, Fox is easily the laziest major studio when it comes to authoring Blu-ray discs.  While Juno doesn't look bad by any stretch of the imagination, it does at times disappoint visually.  Considering that this movie is less than a year old, the so-so quality of this Blu-ray release defies logic.      Juno has an intentionally warm color palate; orange tick tacks, red running uniforms, the interiors of Juno's house, and Juno's wardrobe being a few examples.  In many scenes, almost every scene at Juno's house, colors run together in a sort of dull mesh of blah.  I'm blaming this on Fox's penchant for hastily, and poorly mind you, slapping films on Blu-ray disc without taking the time to polish the image to maximum clarity.  This is a minor nitpick, and one that doesn't even really deserve a full 1 star deduction, but these scenes just left me wondering about future HD releases from Fox.  Sony is a studio that appreciates what Blu-ray is capable of, not surprising since Sony is the biggest pusher of Blu-ray out there.  Still, Juno fails to achieve the sort of three dimensionality inherent to other HD releases.    Usually I focus on the quality of the release, as opposed to the film itself, in order to let others know exactly what it is they're getting for their hard earned money, but I'll be deviating from that trend a little bit here.  First I should say that Juno comes with a decent amount of bonus content, and surprisingly most of it is worth watching.    Now in regards to the film itself, there are a few points of contention I have with Juno.  Diablo Cody's dialog is just a little hard to swallow for me.  I've watched this movie with two different audiences, the 20 something crowd and the 20 something crowd's parents.  The 20 somethings for the most part dig Cody's super-fast slang-laden back and forth, but the older folks occasionally find it a barrier to really enjoying a film.   I totally understand where the old folks are coming from.  A few lines that I found to be particularly ... well stupid are; \\"wizard!\\" as an exclamation and \\"honest to blog\\" used as honest to god.  Once again I'm nit-picking here, because truly is a great film.  But as the folks over at highdefdigest pointed out in their stellar review, Juno suffers from a \\"too cool for school\\" (quoting the digest review here f.y.i.) brand of dialog.  It's just not very believable, which is a shame because the films narrative itself is so utterly plausible.  While Cody's bogus dialog doesn't ruin the film, it may very well prevent you from really getting into this flick.  A shame really, because Juno is, potentially, a film everyone should see.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|I had doubtful opinions when I bought this with my new Nikon D40. I thought the 100 or so dollar flash would turn out to be a piece of junk. And with my extremely miniscule budget of only $650, I can't believe I got great camera with an even better flash! After all, after composition, the most important part of photography is lighting!    I used to have a [[ASIN:B000HAOVGM Canon PowerShot SD800 IS 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Image-Stabilized Optical Zoom]]. It's flash was quite unappealing. It was ugly and made photos look unflattering. But oh, no more.    The best part of this flash is the ability to bounce it at a 90 degree angle. The result is very nice looking, soft images. And only for $100! To experiment, I went to a tall and very dark cave. I brought my D40 and this flash with me, bounced it, and got extremely well-lit pictures. Wow!    This flash is small and I'm glad I did not buy a bigger one, it would be a waste of money (and space). I like that it takes only 2 AA batteries, which I can store easily in my pocket.    So overall, this flash was a very good purchase. If you have the money I recommend it instead of, say, another lens.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|I hate this \\"return to form\\" thing.  It needs explaining, anyway: which \\"form\\" are we talking about?  Because \\"Gardening At Night\\" is certainly not the same \\"form\\" as \\"Pop Song '89\\", for instance.      To me, the best way to describe \\"Accelerate\\" is that there is enough of an echo of \\"Lifes Rich Pageant\\"-era REM to bring a smile to one's face, but not so much of it that it makes one wince that REM is wallowing in their own past.  For me, big chunks of this album dive back even further, into that '60s \\"Nuggets\\" psych-garage rock ethos that REM has only really hinted at in some of their studio albums (\\"Superman\\" as a cover >~< the cheeky \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\").  Nice also to hear a couple of haunting \\"Swan Swan H\\"-esque waltz-timers scattered into the mix!    So, one could say this is a guitar-driven garage rock album w/ only 2 songs over 4 minutes.  Not all the tracks are gems, but, well, they go by fast!  Stipe's voice is growlier than ever and only occasionally gets overwhelmed by Buck's guitar scrangles (not as badly as on \\"Monster\\", thankfully).  Mills employs his bass riffage and background vocals effectively.      Although the jury's out as to whether this will be an all-time classic REM album (time will tell, though), this is the sound of a veteran band who knows what they're doing having a good time, and it's FAB to have a good time along with them again!
B000SZLSB2|5.0|I have his last CD and play it over and over and was not even aware he had a new CD out until watching Dancing With The Stars last night where the guest professionals danced to his live performance singing \\"Carry You Home\\" and this gave me instant goosebumps....made me cry watching them dance to this perfect song to their movements.  He has an amazing and unusual voice...had to run out and purchase this new CD this morning and can't stop playing it.  Love it!
0743455967|5.0|Stephen King manages to create the most interesting and inspiring writing advice book I've had the pleasure of reading.  It's part memoir and part practical writing instruction.  He takes the reader on a journey through his own life - what made him the writer he is, the nuggets and kernels of his earliest creativity, and both his failures and successes.<br /><br />Through telling his own story he leads you comfortably along until he gets to the basics of writing.  Throwing out traditional English Composition coursework he gets down and dirty with what makes a sentence, what style is and how to apply it, and when, where and how to write.  You can't help (well, I couldn't) but to be inspired and want to jump right out there and start writing after reading his stories.<br /><br />This is a must-read for every would-be writer as well as every Stephen King fan.<br /><br />- CV Rick, April 2008
1416550518|4.0|I doubt I would have read this book if not given the opportunity to read it as an Advance Reading Copy. I was a bit dubious because I normally don't read this type of novel.<br /><br />Never fear! I thought Grace was such an endearing, charming narrator. I liked her memories - although her younger self seemed to be a bit more privy to the goings on of the wealthy characters than I would have thought possible - and I was so touched by her observations of her current, much older, dying self. An elderly woman once told me that only her body aged; she still had dreams, wishes, and desires no matter what her age, and I think that Grace really brought that out.<br /><br />I also enjoyed reading about the Hartford family and their friends and neighbors. I thought that the best thing about the novel was the historical context in which it is set, and all these characters survive or falter because of world events during this time. Either the devastating effects of a brutal, extensive war impact fortunes, success, even life, or the gender/cultural/societal expectations hinder those characters who aspire to something more.<br /><br />The mystery? Well, I think that's where the book is at its weakest. The mystery isn't so mysterious and is actually rather evident early on in the book. However, the characters are so charming that the enjoyment of the book comes out of the journey of reading it rather than looking at it as a whodunit. I think that comparing this novel to those of Daphne du Maurier is somewhat of a reach, but that does not mean that this isn't an enjoyable, cozy read. I would definitely pick up Kate Morton's next novel.

B00151HZME|5.0|This is the most perfect M83 album yet. Compared to Gonzalez's previous ambitious, yet somewhat tiresome When the Dawn Heals Us, Saturdays=Youth is a refinedly concentrated short story of shoegaze/retro bliss. The undeniable melodrama of his fragmented narratives (see \\"Graveyard Girl\\") is more digestably sparse in the smaller architecture of the 11-song heartbeat; but the awkward, naive statements effectively serve to enhance the awkward stages of Gonzalez's characters. The vulnerable, diaphanous and hopeful retro sensibility breathes vividly in Gonzalez's soul, and yet his carefully chosen sounds reveal the added shimmer and depth of 21st century techno. His tunes are so thoughtfully derived with historical precision that they work to disarmingly transfigure a pure moment from the 80s (perhaps even more pure...). Moreover, Saturdays=Youth is so obsessed with avoiding even the slightest hint of superfluous ambience and percussion that the effect is slick and masterful.<br /><br />The artwork says it all:  Francis Bacon-ly beautiful, fashion-conscious kiddos brim-full of inexplicable emotions, gathering at the edge of an autumnal wood. The deep colors, pale fires within those fading trees is a testament not to what those kids are feeling, but rather that they are still able to feel at all. It's easy to roll busy eyes and judge a scene like this as the classic Western petri dish of youthful self-obsession--self-fulfilling Goth-mentalities of longing and despair; obstinate druggies replaying irrational fantasies in their growingly incompatible minds; lone dancers, searching aimlessly; unfounded Greco ideals of divine love that serve consumed egos. Even while Gonzalez may be having some fun with certain trendy, filmatic cliches of the past, I think his vision suggests something perhaps more important--it's a photographic warning of the death-nail engaged into the hearts of the eager by a matured society, dulled into oblivion by its perpetually successful ritual of grinding every innate emotion you have into vapor. In these kids' faces gradually appears the fear of creativity's death.<br /><br />Gonzalez's youths represent the last ceremonies of emotional freedom. They not only inhabit the earth, but apprehend it. They meditate within the private spheres of night, resting on Whitman's bed under the stars of contemplation. They celebrate the loves of their friends, immortalizing their names in harmony. They embrace their dustness like the Beats chasing their Beatrices. They are infused with everything.<br /><br />But the innumerable stresses will be sent; it will invite itself into the very fabric of their clothing. They'll forget how it all went exactly.ry innate emotion you have into vapor. In these kids' faces gradually appears the fear of creativity's death.

B000002KOG|5.0|Just as an informational aside, I've owned this album since it came out and later purchased another on vinyl and eventually on CD. The first cover doesn't have \\"Neil Young\\" across the top but only the stark illustration of Neil. I can't remember what possessed me to buy the second LP with the different, current, cover. I was \\"Neil obsessed\\" , I think, ever since I saw the Springfield on my birthday in 1967 at Boston's Back Bay Theatre on a bill with The Beach Boys, the Soul Survivors (remember them?) and the Strawberry Alarm Clock, who never made the show. The gig was double-booked that night, they had all played at the Rhode Island Auditorium on the same night, so the show was running late. I digress. My brother liked the country-like material the Springfield were doing, but I loved the look of Neil, hair hanging down, an echo of the leather fringe hanging from his arms and high moccasins, playing his guitar with intensity, battling against Steve Stills break-for-break. Anyway, back to the album in question. The newer version was re-mixed. I read in Rolling Stone that Neil didn't like the original mix. The new one had louder guitar parts (really noticeable on \\"The Old Laughing Lady\\" and a few other cuts. Other subtle things as well. I still like the first one better, but it is only on vinyl and I like it better probably more because of familiarity. If it were pristine, I suppose it would be worth money to collectors, but it isn't, and I don't think I'd part with it anyway. This was always my most favorite Neil album of all. These songs got me through a few years and I am eternally grateful to Neil for them.
B00005NTJK|5.0|As a newbie to Tull fanaticism (a casual listener who only recently got into the albums and found that he loved them!), there is probably not much I can say here that has not already been said: very briefly, this is a very good album that has been underrated because of its position between two of Tull's greatest and most popular albums.  Like other newbies, I bought Aqualung and Stand Up before this one, and on first listen to Benefit I agreed with the majority that this one did not quite match up.  More so than the other two albums, it is not quite \\"lovable\\" upon the first listen, or even the first two or three.  There is indeed a melancholy dreary feeling that seems to seep from the album, starting with the dark and gloomy album cover, and captured perfectly by the first song \\"With You There to Help Me\\", which seems to set the tone for what is to come.  This dark mood established at the outset seems to cast a shadow over the album as a whole, coloring each tune that follows, and giving the album an overall mournful, dirgelike feel that is unpleasant at first listen.  And, reading Ian Anderson's liner notes, it seems that this dark tone was what he was going for, as he bemoaned life on the road, began feeling the pressures of stardom and commercialism, and felt strong dismay at the current state of the music industry in general and the bland, unoriginal taste of fellow musicians, and their listening public.     Strangely enough, however, a few more listens reveals this album to be a richly textured, dense, fascinating masterpiece that challenges the listener and breaks new ground.  It is an album whose experimental nature makes it sound fresh to contemporary ears, very ahead of its time, matching up well against (and perhaps easily defeating) any contemporary         alternative music of today.  In fact, I would argue that it demonstrates Tull's true nature as the prototypical \\"alternative\\" band, long before that label was invented, and long before \\"alternative\\" suddenly became ironically translated into \\"mainstream\\" somewhere in the late 80s or early 90s.  I  would strongly assert that the \\"alternative\\" aspect of Tull's work is really its essential thrust, as it is never truly folk, heavy metal, hard rock, progressive, jazz, classical, or any other label that you want to place on it...it is primarily just DIFFERENT from anything else out there, and as such cannot be adequately labeled.    This gets to the heart of the main problem with the album, which is also the quality that makes it great: Ian Anderson's giant \\"F You\\" to the entire music industry in creating an album that does not follow what might be thought of as the logic of the commercial music industry.  This sentiment is not confined merely to this Tull album, as such defiance of logic can be found throughout the Tull catalogue, but perhaps the defining characteristics of this defiance and the acerbity with which they are performed and delivered are perhaps most strongly felt on Benefit.  For example, as is the case with much of Tull's work, many of the songs here are what might be considered overlong (including perhaps its three best songs, \\"With You There to Help Me\\", \\"Nothing to Say\\", and \\"To Cry You A Song\\")  and thus seemingly incompatible with heavy rotation on the radio.  Most of the songs do not follow a standard verse chorus verse chorus bridge solo verse chorus formula, like most contemporary pop or rock songs of the era.  Good melodies here are sometimes cut off a bit soon to make way for a sudden shift in the song, good riffs are sometimes spoiled by overrepetition, and both melodies and riffs are often interspersed with discordant or otherwise disturbing sounds which risk disrupting the casual listener's pleasure.  All of this makes the album strikingly uncommercial in its sensibilities, and surprisingly so perhaps considering that one might expect the band to expand upon its newly established image, given the recent massive success of the immensely popular album, Stand Up.  But it is also what makes it an extraordinarily interesting listen in comparison to its predecessor.       However, the main area where this giant \\"F you\\" poses the greatest problem is in the SONG ORDER, which seems to be designed specifically to resist the logic of the music industry.  Whereas Aqualung and even Stand Up have a very appealing flow in their song order, starting with a very strong, rocking song of wide commercial appeal (\\"Aqualung\\" or \\"New Day Yesterday\\") then mixing it up with acoustic numbers and rockers paced evenly and then ending up with satisfying rockers (\\"Locomotive Breath\\"/\\"Wind Up\\" or \\"For A Thousand Mothers\\"), this one begins with the sad, subtle, and somber \\"With You There to Help Me\\" and ends with the relatively quiet acoustic number \\"Sossity; You're A Woman\\".  Neither song seems immediately likable or even memorable, even though both certainly grow on you after repeated play.  That said, they are both very good songs that would probably show up somewhere in the middles of either Aqualung or Stand Up.  Moreover, there is no song on Benefit that has the widespread commercial appeal of the two big singles that came out just prior to the release of this album, included here as bonus tracks: \\"Teacher\\" and \\"Witch's Promise\\".  From a purely commercial standpoint it was clearly a huge mistake to fail to include both of these two songs on the original album as they are both standouts.  Still, from an artistic standpoint, they are not perhaps in line with the mood that Anderson was going for on Benefit, nor the statement that he was obviously trying to make by resisting commercialism in the music industry.  I would actually go as far as to say that with the inclusion of these two songs and a rearrangement of the order of the other songs, this album would have a COMPLETELY different feel and would have probably even be interpreted differently.  For example, to rearrange Benefit to follow an Aqualung-like format, imagine beginning with the cynical yet hard rocking winner \\"To Cry You a Song\\", followed up another one in \\"Son\\" (perhaps the \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" of Benefit), then move to a couple of shorter, quieter, more folky numbers like \\"Sossity; You're A Woman\\" and \\"For Michael Collins, Jeffrey, and Me\\", and \\"Witch's Promise\\".    Then you might move to \\"Play in Time\\" (maybe the \\"My God\\" of Benefit) and and then back to a rocking, commercially appealing song like \\"Teacher\\" (possibly the \\"Hymn 43\\" of Benefit).  Then you might move back again to some of the shorter quieter numbers with \\"Inside\\", \\"Alive and Well and Living In\\" and \\"A Time for Everything?\\".  Then you would end on a strong note again with the powerful but underrated \\"Nothing to Say\\", a song which might find itself quite comfortable on today's alternative rock stations.  This change-up would accentuate the best, most hard rocking songs on the album but would also make the quieter acoustic numbers more refreshing as a counterpoint to the rockers.        To use another analogy, we might say that this is the \\"Let it Be\\" of the Tull catalogue, as an underrated collection of songs, oozing with tension and world-weariness, overwrought with layers of production, and suffering from similar problems such as lack of \\"sensible\\" song order.  In the case of the Beatles, these are problems which were to a large degree corrected on the remastered and reshuffled Let it Be Naked album.  Although I understand that there were significant improvements in the albums sound quality in this new remastered version, Tull/Ian Anderson chose not to \\"correct\\" the song order, and in fact substituted \\"Teacher\\" from the US version with  the far less appealing \\"Alive and Well and Living In\\", only to tack on \\"Teacher\\" at the end as a bonus track (seemingly a strong insult to what is by most accounts a very good song).     In my opinion, this kind of change-up in the song order would make the album more appetizing in terms of commercial appeal, and,using today's technology, one might simply reprogram the song order to achieve such an effect, if they so wished.  Still, the brilliance of Ian Anderson's musical and artistic vision might be lost.  Much of the album's energy is drawn from its depression and darkness, and its song order magnifies this overall feeling of bleakness and despondency.  I highly recommend this album to anyone with the patience to give it a few spins to let the artistic brilliance shine through.  For those who prefer a more commercially-oriented album, I suggest reprogramming the song list to give it more of the Aqualung-style pacing that it currently lacks. In either case, it is an album that invites you \\"inside\\" its window, and is definitely worth the price of admission.
0385338724|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is a marvelous author. One can depend on her novels to be charming and interesting. REMEMBER ME is no exception; in fact, it may be slightly better than the later books in the SHOPAHOLIC series. (SHOPAHOLIC may finally have run out of steam.)     Ultimately, REMEMBER ME is predictable, as all of Kinsella's books are, but with Kinsella, the pleasure is in the journey and not with the final destination.    REMEMBER ME is filled with fascinating details about high-end, of-the-moment London and a far-away reader will come out with a vicarious sense of place.     And, when one gets to the inevitable happy ending, it is with a sense of fulfillment.    REMEMBER ME is Kinsella's best work since the early SHOPAHOLIC books.

B0011FDVKE|5.0|I slid \\"Another Country\\" into the CD and hit play.  I planned to select one of the 2 songs I had already heard on the radio, but stopped because the first song caught me, the second song was one that I knew and liked- the next thing I knew the cd was over and I had to hear it all again !!!  The lyrics are prolific and the music incredible !  Mix Tift's angelic sounding vocals, Jay Brown's harmonies, Zeke Hutchins' clocklike drumwork, Danny Eisenberg on Keys and Chalie Sexton's guitar leads and you have some awesome music.  There are just too many really good songs here to pick a favorite, but my eyes seem to water up with joy whenever I hear \\"Morning is My Destination\\".  Check out her homepage and MYSPACE for more.      If you have the opportunity to see Tift live Go !!  She puts on an incredible high energy performance.  Heck, just look at the wear surrounding the pickguard of her Gibson guitar - she rocks !   If you like Sheryl Crow, Patti Griffin, Kathleen Edwards, Carol King, Joni Mitchell, E. Lou Harris, or Dusty Springfield you will enjoy.
B000002UWL|5.0|This album truly is a classic.  The songs are well written and the more you listen to them the more they mean something to you.  I bought the album when it first came out and would listen to it every night when I went to bed.  It is the kind of album I put on and just want to lose myself in.  It's all about growing up and living life - brilliant!    It doesn't have the disco edge of other PSB albums, but the moods in it are amazing.  Being Boring is probably one of the best pop songs ever written, and the video is fantastic.  Lines like \\"we were never being boring, we had too much time to find for ourselves...\\", \\"I never dreamt that I would get to be the creature that I always meant to be, but I thought in spite of dreams, you'd be sitting somewhere here with me...\\" - just leave you with chills!    If you are a PSB fan already or just discovering them for the first time you have to have this album as it truly is the best thing they have ever done - and I am probably one of their biggest fans, so it is coming on good authority!

0446401307|4.0|Michael Connelly strikes once again!!  \\"The Overlook\\" is a crisp, well written crime novel that grabs the reader quickly and does not let go until the end.  The story takes place in less than a day, and in many ways feels like an episode of \\"24.\\"  (That is meant as a compliment.)    Connelly continues to develop Harry Bosch as well as agent Walling.  Both are good characters playing good roles.  Some reviewers have complained that the book is too short, but the truth is, I like quick reads, so that was not a problem for me.    I have now read four Connelly books, and will definitely read more.  \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" remains my favorite, but this one is a fine story.

This album is very much an expanded White Stripes album(without Meg White)but done VERY WELL! I feel its probably Jack Whites best album to date(but the last White Stripes album was very good also!)I feel the playing of the Raconteurs add a little more polish and finish to Jack's sound;also that Rolling Stones Vibe that's coming thru definitely makes the album even more airplay friendly. THIS IS A HIT!
0440234743|1.0|The beginning of the book is typical Grisham; intense, exciting and creative. That about a tenth of the book.  Unfortunately after that it gets long-winded and then it gets really looong-winded. I kept wondering when the plot would thicken or something interesting would happen, and then I eventually finished the book and was still waiting.  Its also a bit of a downer book - full of sickness and insect problems.  Oh well, I guess every Grisham book can´t be a hit.

184195425X|4.0|In Life of Pi, narrator Pi Patel states that his story \\"...will make you believe in God.\\" Author Yann Martel throughout the rest of the book uses a simple but intriguing plotline to bring forth the question, \\"Which is preferable, a painful truth or a less true but easier to accept account of events?\\" Martel tries to answer the above question in terms of both religious views and Pi's story.   Martel was born in Spain in 1963 to Canadian parents. He attended college in Ontario, where he studied Philosophy and discovered his love for writing. Life of Pi, his third book and second novel, is filled with philosophical insight and observations about human nature and survival.   Although the author does not give a direct answer to his original question, he certainly gives enough information to the readers to answer it for themselves. Pi himself decides by the end of the book that the only way to accept such things as God and miracles is to choose a less-painful and perhaps less believable tale. Pi's decision to continue practicing his three faiths at the same time, although supportive of religion, hardly conveys the same sentiment expressed by most religions. Pi seems to believe in his religions because the alternative is the \\"dry, yeastless, factuality\\" that is today's world; a world in which living is \\"Missing a better story\\" of faith and fables. However, religions are formed and practiced by most because of firm belief in what is absolutely true.   Life of Pi is a well-written book that keeps the reader engaged and allowed me to sympathize with Pi as he struggles throughout the story. Unfortunately, the reader has to struggle though the first few chapters of scattered dialogue and varied narrators before truly being drawn into the story. Under the surface of a simple survival story lies an intricate examination of choice and perspective.
B0000029GA|5.0|To understand how good this album, just consider some of the CLASSIC releases between 1993 and 1995.    1993: Doggystyle, Midnight Marauders, and Enter The 36 Chambers.  1994: Hard To Earn, Dare Iz A Darkside, and Ready To Die.  1995: Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, The Infamous, and Dah Shinin.    I've just listed some very good pieces of work, yet none of them come close, and although Ready To Die is seen as it's main contemporary, Illmatic does separate itself from that album as well.    Let's jump into the album minus the intro, but if you want to hear a real intro, try the one on Stillmatic. God like flow at it's best...    The first time I heard \\"NY State of Mind\\", I did not want to hear the rest of the album b/c the song was so good I didn't think that it could get any better. The beat provided by DJ Premier has to be in the top five of his ENTIRE catalogue. Just a chilling, haunting beat with the lyrics to match (Heard a few chicks scream/ my arms shook, couldn't look/ gave another squeeze,heard it click, yo my s#&t is stuck). The scratches at the end are the song are on point, too. From there we have \\"Life's a B!%&h\\". I think it was the only song where I heard Nas outshined by another emcee. AZ's career never took off, but from this verse alone it's obvious that he has more talent than most guys can fathom.    Next up is \\"The World is Yours\\". I never really appreciated this song when it was released. I mean, the lyrics were standard Nas, and the beat by Pete Rock is of a master class, but it didn't catch. To put it short, something was wrong with me, b/c the piano loop is hypnotic, and lyrics are second to none. Just as a cherry on top, check out the video to the remix on YouTube. The second verse is magical.    Halftime is the next song, and even though it's good, you can tell that it was not recorded for this album (Zebrahead Sdtk.). Memory Lane is another song with superior lyrics (Sentence begins indented, with formality/my duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology). The next three songs are good, especially \\" One Love\\", and then the album ends with \\" It Ain't Hard to Tell\\".    For me, this is my favorite song in his catalogue. It doesn't have the thematic direction of \\"NY State of Mind\\" , but it's lyrical wizardry at it's finest. I think everyone went mad like I did when Nas announced that he was half breed (Hit the earth like a comet, invasion/ Nas is like the afrocentric-azin/half man, half amazin'). Also, Large Professor should give a lesson on sampling to fake producers after his \\"amazin\\" use of \\"Human Nature\\" by QJ and MJ.    Folks, no other hip-hop album can be judged against this seminal piece of work, save for \\" It Takes A Million\\" by PE or \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" by NWA. It's that good...

The plot elements of<br />a AI self -awareness, time -travel and total atomic war only add<br />to the \\"tech\\" level of the movie.<br />The \\"extra\\" disk in this set is \\"Windows\\" only:<br />for me since it appears that that system is failing rapidly and will be the past in a very few years, only lends to the  tech of the movie and the predictions of future AI at a whole new higher level.
B000YABYLA|5.0|And an unexpected feel-good film.  Juno is not your typical teenage pregnancy story.  It is, instead, a realistic, yet surprisingly entertaining look at an extremely difficult year in the life of a young pregnant girl.  With a loving and caring family, good friends, and the baby's father, Juno attempts to take back control of her life and her circumstances, and to make life altering decisions in her own unique and quirky way.<br /><br />Ellen Page is a phenomenal young actress who plays the title role of June with realism, warmth, intelligence and a wisecracking wit.  Juno wants to do what is best for her baby, for her family, for her friends, and for herself.  Ellen Page expertly runs the gamut of Juno's emotions and hormones, slowly drawing us in and making us a part of this girl's life and her predicament.  We laugh, we cry, we hope, we care.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is equally talented and up to the challenge.  Michael Cera as the child's father and Juno's best friend, J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's shocked but supportive parents, and Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner as the desperate, prospective adoptive parents all give excellent, believable performances.<br /><br />Juno sneaks up on you.  It is a quiet film that subtly gets under your skin.  I highly recommend this film for a sweet, touching evening at home.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|I've always been a fan of real stories with serial killers.  I watched the movie The Zodiac and was highly interested in the zodiac killer.  Then this movie comes out, a higher budget, more opinionated telling of the tragedy.  The way it was drawn out, with the suspense, truth, and few glamorized features, this movie topped my list of best movies.  Some call this a horror, some call it a drama, I call it ecclecticly awesome!
B00132D808|1.0|If you like the beatles, then buy the beatles albums.  This one is a far cry from it and shouldn't even be labeled close to that.  The songs seem to have that feel, but the music is nothing like the old CD which is why I gave them my money.  Big mistake and won't make that again.  I NEVER write bad reviews on here, but this one just had to be warned about!    Save your cash.  Speak with your wallet.    -Reagan
B001437DMA|3.0|While I've loved Satch since I first bought Surfing with the Alien back in the day, I've noticed that the past few albums have seemed lackluster to me. My biggest gripe with Satch is something I didn't mind back when Surfing came out, that being that the only instrument in the music that gets to shine is the guitar. That's fine on a basic level, but these songs could be so much better if Satch would let the excellent musicians he plays with do something more than provide a basic rhythm for his stellar playing. This feeling really hit home after watching a video he produced called Reel Satriani wherein Satch spent so much time whining over how the musicians, particularly Manut Cache (awesome drummer) didn't 'feel' what he expected them to feel in the music he'd created. He wanted them to play the exact first draft he made up with a dinky drum machine and the most mundane rhythm guitar on the planet and all but had a fit when Glen Johns suggested he let them have free rein to do what they felt would be best. This movie was all about the self titled album, which happens to be one of my favorite albums because the other musicians seem to have been allowed to 'play' too. So, back to Satchifunkilus... this album suffers from Satch's need to control all aspects of the music. It suffers from a dumbing down of the ensemble. There are a few great songs here, but nothing like Crystal Planet, Flying in a Blue Dream or even Strange Beautiful Music. Its unfortunate that we always have to wait for live versions of these songs to come out before they become great.

1594489505|3.0|I had so much expectation for this book after reading the Kite Runner which I liked very much.  Hosseini's first book gave me a rare glimpse of a country and culture that I knew little of.  Later part was rather ordinary but I liked it in general.  But his second book, though it is surely a good read, doens't deserve 5 stars. Despite some little twists here and there, the overall story is quite predictable.  And coming from a country that experienced civil war in mid 20th century, I've read similar story lines time and time again, i.e., two women sharing a brutal husband, raped by war and tradition, but making themselves friends, and sacrificing herself for the good of the other woman.  Hope the author does a better job next time.
B000KGGB2A|5.0|Take That were once one of the greatest boybands in the world and their split in 1996 really sent the female fans into turmoil as they tried to come to terms with them no longer being a 4 or 5 piece. Before officially reforming they did try to get together as a 5 piece but news was reported that Robbie had turned the offer down because he felt he was too big of a star to go back to Take That. When you talk about bad decisions you should talk about Robbie Williams turning down the offer to help reform Take That, as they did what nobody saw coming and they took the UK by storm once again and repeated the magic that they once had. This time around they had a maturity that wasn't recognisable from their original days when they were dancing around in the camp manner that they became known for.<br /><br />Mark Owen & Gary Barlow are still the front runners of the group; Mark as only a couple of years before had won the TV Reality show Celebrity Big Brother and Gary for his quite short but extremely successful solo career. Howard Donald & Jason Orange had also returned to the group and presented their own sense of individuality and maturity to the group.<br /><br />The Debut single for the album, Patience flew to number one and the tickets for their reunion tour sold out in a matter of hours for all dates and venues. This album was something that inspired a tidal wave of groups reforming, they even inspired the Spice Girls to reform. This album was slated to be their only album and the tour was originally going to be a one off, but due to the success of the album and the tour they're still together and recording a new album.<br /><br />Patience<br />Shine<br /><br />Are easily the best songs/singles from this album and they're what made this album special and what inspired a wave of fans to re-unite and jump right back on the Take That bandwagon.

B000002AGN|4.0|My piano instructor recommended this CD to me. I decided to pick it up, and presto a day later a review is jumping from my fingers. This album is considered a classic Jazz album by many and I can hear why. Odd time signatures, solid play, and quality compositions. That being said I can't rate this CD 5 stars. I just can't put this recording in the same catagory as Miles Davis \\"Kind Of Blue.\\" Don't get me wrong!!! I'm glad I own it, and it will get many plays in my CD player and I-POD. However, I just can't put it on par with some of the other Jazz CD's I've come across in times past.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed the entire CD. However, my favorite compositions on here are: Blue Rondo, and Strange Meadow Lark. I just find that my ear happens to enjoy the rhythmic and melodic content in those two compositions over the others. This CD sounds before it's time (1959 originally recorded), but music has come a long way since.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I really enjoyed this CD, it's worth having, but there are other jazz artists I like more.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I've heard negative things about this flick and some good amount of positive.  I saw this movie with the negativity on my mind and I started this review ahead of time.  I said it's a three star review hands down, it's game over for Cloverfield.  The only reason it did not get a five it's  because of the shaking camera, it's a bad film technique but I got over it.  It was a blast, the creature is pretty frightening and the parasites are disgusting.  J.J. Adams is a mastermind weaving intricate webs of secrets and playing with our imagination.  This film is beautiful and rich with shocking moments that are truly terrifying.  It's starts off confusing then it picks up the pace and never really slows down.  I have to warn people who will watch this with their kids especially little kids it will make them pee their pants.  In one part of the movie blood is introduced and it was extremely vulgar in it's delivery it was actually disturbing.  Within the film you feel so connected to the characters and feel that you are witnessing the true horror of a monster attack through a first-person view.  The ending is quite brilliant and horrifying it will stay with you.  This film is haunting and vicious everyone needs to see this movie.  And watch it more than once because it will get confusing.
B00104QSOM|2.0|\\"There Will Be Blood\\" screenplay and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, writer and director of \\"[[ASIN:B00003CWTI Magnolia (New Line Platinum Series)]]\\". Based on the book \\"[[ASIN:1934568457 Oil]]\\" by Upton Sinclair<br /><br />The Late 1800's: Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is prospecting for silver and failing. After blasting in his mine he finds oil instead of silver. Plainview is no longer a prospector but an \\"Oil Man\\" and one of the shrewdest businessmen ever portrayed. A few years of drilling for oil pass. A young man arrives who is willing to disclose the location of property rich with oil. So much that it is literally seeping out of the ground. Plainview's interest is peeked and after negotiating with the young man he is off to check out this prospect, but not dressed as an oil man.......<br /><br />There is absolutely no doubt that Daniel Day-Lewis deserved the Oscar that he received for his roll in \\"There Will Be Blood\\" but even with as spectacular a display as Day-Lewis gives us, it still wasn't enough to save this movie. It essentially comes across as a negative commentary on aspects of American culture that are important to many which are Capitalism and Religion. Plainview represents Capitalism in its darkest form as a businessman with no scruples about buying land out from under unsuspecting owners using false pretenses and carrying a fake son around to appear that he is a family man. Religion is represented by Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), who is an up and coming preacher who is portrayed as something of a snake oil salesman whose underlying motives are to improve his own situation with the tool of religion. I guess this should'nt be a surprise since the book that this movie was based off of is written by a socialist.<br /><br />The Good: The acting all around was great. Daniel Day-Lewis's performance was masterful and deserves praise. The production of the movie overall was great, from the sets to the costumes to the look of the movie. The only production value that was lacking was the music.<br /><br />The Bad: The story just didn't seem to go anywhere. The majority of the story takes place in one town and you watch Plainview milk it dry and make himself rich and that is about it. The movie is character driven and it is interesting to watch the shrewdness of the Plainview character but it just wasn't enough for me.<br /><br />The music and it's placement in this film were a mystery to me. There music itself is interesting but just felt out of place at all times. The sound and tone of this soundtrack would best be described as frantic and anxious. It seemed to me that since so little is happening in the film this uncomfortable music was inserted to create tension and mood since what was happening on screen couldn't convey it on its own. Music to help accent tension/drama/etc is fine but to create and maintain it is overboard. An example would be that at one point in the film Plainview is using surveying equipment to lay out a future pipeline which is not a very energetic or exciting scene. All the while in the background we have the frantic soundtrack wailing away like fingernails on a chalk board.<br /><br />Overall: Watch this movie if you want to view great acting. If you want to watch a great movie however, watch something else.g was the music.    The Bad: The story just didn't seem to go anywhere.

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Everyone remembers these guys (minus Kennedy) from Creed, and yes I was a fan of them, but these guys have something different. It's weird how they're different, but the same people...maybe Stapp controlled the whole thing. When I first heard of Alter Bridge I pushed them aside and one day someone had me listen to the first track on the first record and I was amazed. It was HEAVY and melodic. This is a perfect follow up album..A lot of bands when they jump to the second record are sort of unsure of what to do, they usually go melodic, which is fine, i love melody, but not so soon, not after the first album was pure metal. So, for blackbird to me I felt the aggressive parts were more aggressive, and the melodic parts were more melodic..!!! Amazing cd, well worth the wait..Favorites, Blackbird, Ties That Bind, Brand New Start, Buried Alive, and Wayward One...Well worth the purchase. God Bless

B0006VYG62|5.0|I am a 35 year old male.  This shouldn't matter, but as \\"The Bell Jar\\" over the years has become more a punchline than literature, the fact that I was not a young woman between the ages of 16 and 23 kept me from tackling it.  I was pretty sure I couldn't relate.  This is a fallacy of my own making.  This book IS about being a woman to an extent, but it is also a profound look into the nature of humanity and the often inane way that we just begin to slip and then fall.  There are always deeper reasons for slipping into darkness, but the reality is that they are not necessarily clear when we are fighting off the demons.  This is where therapists often fail.  They need to NAME the cause of the malady, like dianosing you with cancer.  Where Plath succeeds most in her book is her treatment of the unknown quality of the downward spiral.  Sure, peppered throughout the book there and hints and allegations of potential trauma, but, thankfully, they are not dwelt upon.  It does get a bit obtuse in the middle, but it quickly snaps itself back into shape for a very profound final scene.  I highly recommend it FOR ANY READER.  It is a hell of a lot better than the incredibly overrated \\"Catcher In The Rye\\".

B00154GEFU|4.0|Phoenix is a delicious treat created by progressive rock veterans Geoff Downes (keyboards), Steve Howe (guitars), Carl Palmer (drums) and John Wetton (bass and vocals). Most listeners will remember this group of talented British musicians from the early 80's when they were young and new to the music scene. They experienced great success with their first album entitled Asia which produced several hit songs and a fetching salary. Fast forward to the year 2008 and we find these same British gentlemen a good deal older, wiser and just as talented as that first forray into our musical world. From the rocking opener Never Again, to the anthemic sing-along An Extaordinary Life, this CD is filled with soaring keyboards, beautiful vocal harmonies, impressive guitars and solid drumming. The subject matter for some of the songs suggests the writer has been around the block for sure. There is one song in particular that I'm sure will be heard when sending off a loved one to the great unknown and that is the beautiful and haunting \\"I Will Remember You\\". If you have ever lost anyone close, this will surely start the waterworks flowing. My personal favorite is \\"Parallel Worlds/Vortex/Deya\\" which is simply beautiful. Most of the songs on Phoenix are what I would call \\"Mellow Rock\\" due to the pop flavor over a progressive vibe. Still these great tunes are not going to be heard on the radio which overplays little boy bands with long bangs and blondes with bleached teeth. I highly recommend this album to those who like bands such as Yes, Genesis, Rush, ELP. Fans of Asia probably already own it. - Ciao

I find her book to be a collection of fashion tips and advises, and with a lot of pictures the book is not boring at all. The book has nothing short of all other good style books out there, it cover so many subjects. I think she is a very stylish woman, and she has a good taste ( look who she picked as her partner :) )she only needs to smile a little bit, being too serious is boring but definitely not her book.
B000EGF0QY|5.0|This book had me laughing out loud more than anything I've read in a long time. What I liked best about the collection, however, is that each essay carries its own weight. There is a purpose to each story and I never questioned how long it took me to get from start to finish. I was too busy laughing. Sedaris taps into his entire being, putting his heart and soul into his work. No one is safe--especially his colorful family and outrageous friends. Some might find his work offensive, but he makes no excuses. You get what you get with this collection . . . originality, great writing, irreverence, wit.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Let's face it, I don't want to follow the plot of \\"the Wall\\" when drifting off.  Do you?  This disc does the job of sending me off to sleep when I need to be counting sheep (pun almost intended).  Few albums do that job well and that in itself makes this a classic compilation.<br /><br />This is the perfect mix tape of Pink Floyd done in digital perfection.  The way the song run together, almost makes it a new Floyd Album.  It's nice to see Syd represented very well and maybe some of the new Floyd fans will Discover Piper at the Gates of Dawn because of this.  Additionally, if I were to introduce someone to Pink Floyd, I would buy them this and Dark Side of the Moon.  Who would have ever thought that a 16 minute track would have sounded short, but the Echoes edit is done masterfully.  I call this set, the \\"Portable Pink Floyd.\\"  You will love it.  Now how about some classic live material?
0446677450|4.0|Robert Kiyosaki's a visionary; it takes a man of insight and perception to be able to view financial minutiae in the \\"outside the box\\" ideology  he writes about in Rich Dad/Poor Dad. Tracing a lifetime of experience in financial intelligence, Kiyosaki's goal is to spread the financial knowledge of the rich class--which is a guarded \\"trade\\" secret the poor and middles classes often don't realize--to the masses. Kiyosaki's crusade stems from competing factors, but chief among them is the gift of alternative education he had the benefit of receiving from his rich dad while a pre-teen. \\"Rich dad\\" is actually a term for his best friend Mike's father who, apparently, started the biggest company Hawaii's ever seen; his childhood bud, Mike, was allegedly groomed by the \\"rich dad\\" and now runs the Hawaiian business. Since Kiyosaki didn't inherit any such business, he had to rely on his own application of the financial intelligence Mike's \\"rich dad\\" instilled in him.<br /><br />Kiyosaki's book is laid out so it chronologically traces his life's growth as someone learning and then applying the \\"rich dad\\" principles first as a young man out of college, then as someone getting a try at his first few jobs, and then, finally, as someone who was able to make money work for him and retire by 47. Like all \\"self-help\\" books of this nature, one cannot expect Kiyosaki to contrive a \\"fits-all\\" plan everyone can robotically apply to their own life and expect to be successful; as IQ is defined as figuring out one's true skills and then applying them, so must all readers of this book take Kiyosaki's broad guidelines and apply to them their own, personal situation.<br /><br />Kiyosaki's book is full of anecdotes about the lessons imparted to him by Rich Dad when he was a kid--which is the device he uses to convey the principles of the rich class--but his tome is bolstered by sound, financial principles and strategy. Essentially, the \\"secret\\" the rich teach their kids which the poor and middle classes don't is the wisdom of having your money work for you, as opposed to the convention which sees the majority of people working for someone else.<br /><br />Despite a disclaimer early in the book by the accountant, Lechter, about Kiyosaki's ideology being so unorthodox that the \\"pros\\" generally decry it, the wisdom about having one's money work for himself is irrefutably sound. The concept of making one's money work for himself is largely based on generating wealth through assets which make the money for the holder. Though this isn't revolutionary in and of itself, it's safe to convict the majority of the population for having neglected this basic principle of wealth building, seeing as how the masses unrelentingly weigh themselves down with liabilities instead!!!!<br /><br />Again, Kiyosaki is very general in his advice to build up assets and only buy liabilities when one's reached the point of one's assets being able to make money, but even this is something the masses scornfully overlook. The vast majority of people go into deleterious debt instantly when they start their adult lives since financial education has been boycotted by the schools. So, the average person will amass credit card debt, loan debt, etc., until they're constrictively living paycheck to paycheck, unable to thrive or survive if that one stream of income is cut off. This segues fittingly into Kiyosaki's observation that even \\"professionals\\" (doctors, lawyers, etc.) endure a constant battle with managing their personal finances and building wealth. People with great education are basically neutered if they seek to become wealthy because their education was misapplied into a trade instead of financial intelligence.<br /><br />Equally important in attaining financial intelligence is the even broader concept of taking risk and also eliminating the self-impairing thought of \\"I can't afford that\\" from one's mentality. Kiyosaki's anecdote is that the rich man will never indoctrinate himself to believe that he cannot do something; doing this simply prevents a person from finding solutions to overcoming a problem. The poor man, however, constantly tells himself that he's limited and thusly quits without trying. In this way, Kiyosaki's advice is also philosophical rather than strictly financial, yet it has resounding impact on one's ability to generate wealth. Likewise, fear of risk-taking will neutralize a person to remain in the status quo since they permit fear of failure to prevent them from pursuing actions leading to financial independence and wealth.<br /><br />The predicament with undeserving critics of Rich Dad/Poor Dad--who make up the minority of reviewers--is they misconceive Kiyosaki's purpose and embellish what his book should deliver. Defamers are frustrated that Kiyosaki doesn't make life easier for them by specifically spelling out how each person can achieve financial success, yet those defamers have merely been given solid guidelines by Kiyosaki, which they must apply to their own situations. If critics stop nitpicking about Rich Dad's identity/reality, they'll see that Kiyosaki's guidelines, if intelligently applied, make one more likely to attain wealth than the conventional wisdom of getting a good job and working for someone for life.doing this simply prevents a person from finding solutions to overcoming a problem.

184195425X|3.0|Yann Martel tells the story of a young boy's hard journey after losing his family, and living through tough life experiences, like being on a boat in solitude for over a year.  In Life of Pi Yann Martel's goal is to show how story telling can be an outlet for struggle, and the importance of religion.     Yann Martel, as a child, lived all around the world. After traveling the world, he went to college, at Trent University.  His major in college was philosophy.  After college he did many random jobs, including tree planting. It took Yann Martel until his late twenties to discover his passion for writing, but he has been writing as a career ever since.     Even though Martel did a fabulous job elaborating and adding intense details to his story, at some points it was a little too dramatic, and surreal.  In one chapter Pi discusses an island that becomes a monster which consumes everything on the ground in the cover of dark.  Even though the author's goal was to show how story telling can help one survive, at times he was a little over the top. He completed this goal through Pi's story of animals as people on the boat.  Another goal of Yann Martel was to show how struggle can help people find God and religion.  Yann Martel presents this by continually discussing Pi's devotion towards religion.  In one chapter one of Yann Martel's character who came into Pi's life said \\"Religion is darkness\\" followed by Pi's response \\"Darkness is the last thing that religion is.  Religion is light\\". This quotations represent the goal of Yann Martel because it shows Pi's passion and devotion towards religion.  This goal is also accomplished through Pi's dedication to multiple religions. Pi is a believer in Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. Throughout the novel, Yann Martel expressed and accomplished the goals continually.   One of the strengths of Yann Martel in his novel is suspense. Martel keeps readers engaged in the book from the beginning to the end. However, on the downside Yann Martel's plot is confusing to follow.  Every few chapters Martel would throw in a random memory  which can completely confuse readers.  If  readers can follow Martel's random interjections of plot, Life of Pi is a fantastic book to read.    [...]

There is so much going on in there; all his insecurities and all the details he remembers about each girl or each situation.  Who says men don't remember?  The movie captures the endless questioning and inner struggle perfectly, never mind that John Cusack was the perfect person to play the main charecter \\"Rob\\", given Cusack's film history of getting dumped and never getting the girl, etc.      This book is a must read for anyone, man or woman, who would like to comically explore the ins and outs of other people's relationships.

0618918248|5.0|Theists need to realize that arguing back to a \\"Big Banger\\" or 'unmoved mover' (i.e., something that can cause other things to move that itself was unmoved and/or uncaused) does not even begin to be sufficient for proving God's existence.  In fact, it is not at all clear that it is even necessary.  First, the idea of a \\"Big Banger\\" is routed in the Principle of Sufficient reason (i.e., that everything has a cause or reason for being).  Humans like to depend on this principle in order to justify a \\"Big Banger\\", but the fact of the matter is that the Principle of Sufficient Reason was given up by philosophers over 200 years ago because it has not shown itself to be necessary (or sufficient).  It may well be the case that some things have no cause or reason.  This is not to say that this IS the case; simply that it MIGHT be the case.  Given this, one cannot PROVE the necessity of a \\"Big Banger\\".    Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that there is a \\"Big Banger\\".  Theists (just like Acquinas) falsely believe that this somehow proves God's existence.  It does nothing of the sort!  It does not prove that the \\"Big Banger\\" is omnipotent (only powerful enough to be an 'unmoved mover'); it does not prove that the BB is omnicient (only that it is smart enough to do the aforementioned); and most of all, it does not prove that this being is omnibenevolent (i.e., perfectly good).  In fact, this \\"Big Banger\\" could just as well be perfectly 'evil'.  Creating \\"everything\\" does not entail any amount of goodness.  Hell, it doesn't even entail immortality.    So all that can be proved (being as generous as possible to the purporters of this argument) is that there is an 'uncreated creator'; but none of the 3 necessary qualities of God have been established (i.e., omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence) therefore God has NOT BEEN PROVED TO EXIST.    So please, theists, educate yourselves a little more before basing your claims on this useless argument.

Unfortunately she has VERY limited knowlege of the changes that happen physiologically within the body during pregnancy and the precautions that should be taken during this workout at various stages of pregnancy.  I am pregnant with my second child and am a physical therapist.  If I did not have a broad underatnding of precatutions that shoudl be taken not to damage my pelvis or low back during her numerous squats and one legged activities I would most likely have a significant injury that would cause me pain through the rest of my pregnancy.  Look elsewhere for a workout DVD by someone who specializes in womens health and fitness.

B00154GEFU|4.0|Not great but not bad. Rehashing of lots of old Asia riffs but hell of lot better than the tribute band that has been masquerading as the real thing for more than 2 decades.    Still trying to get into it but the medley instrumental track has some awesome melodies and guitar work by Howe. It stands out right from the start.    I am just glad that this didn't turn out be a complete embarrassment. With so many old timers releasing absolutely hideous stuff on their \\"the\\" reunion CD, this one is a rare gem almost.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|I got this movie for my wife.  It's a BBC film split into four one hour episodes.  I watched it with her and was impressed with the depth and complexity of the characters.  It had believable acting and a good story.  It was a very enjoyable film.  As long as you don't mind movies that require patience, it is great. If you are a fan of any of the Jane Austin movies you will probably like this one as well.

Laugh and cry with them and I was moved to tears by the exquisite writing. Enjoy the journey, love the ride and maybe like me you will hope it would never end. Along with young adults I as a full blown adult adored this book and the way it was told.  You must follow this up with the Book Thief. These books I will always remember.
0345438205|1.0|I just finished this novel and was stunned that it was over...I kept waiting for something to happen and all of the sudden I was left looking at credits and commentary by Clarke.<br /><br />I agree with others that this book should never have been published.  I disagree that there is anything really interesting in it.  None of the ideas are new, and most have been presented better in other books.  The fact that it shares something with the movie \\"Independence Day\\" should be an indication that it isn't very good.<br /><br />The story just plods along with no real focus or reason for being until near the end and then the solution is so matter of fact, and trivial that it just sucks the life out of the Odyssey series.<br /><br />I would recommend passing on this book.
0451191153|4.0|According to Ayn Rand, there are two kinds of people: the creative individualist who discovers new ideas, who does not go along with what is considered popular, and the altruist, who is a mediocrity, and goes along with concensus opinion.  Ms. Rand says that government leaders and especially dictators, carry out policies thought to be for the good of the many, but. instead wind up causing mass destruction.    Rand's supreme individualist in _The Fountainhead_ is Howard Roark, a unique architect who is creative and eschews architectural designs  accepted, for many years, by the public and other architects.  Roark, as an architectural student, bucks the curriculum so much, that he is expelled from school. Given a commission to build a temple, Roark, his creativity in high gear, is sued by his client for \\"perverting\\" the final project into nothing at all his client had in mind.    Peter Keating, Roark's architectural rival, is the typical Rand collectivist: he goes along with what is accepted in building design, has no imagination and is more concerned with making money than with creating a work of art.  Keating endeavors so much to become a partner in his architectual firm that he harasses an old and infirm partner until the partner dies and Keating gets his wish.    Another major character in this book is Gail Wynand, the extraordinarily successful publisher of the Banner, a scandal mongering tabloid.  Wynand's enemy is Ellsworth Toohey, who writes a very popular column in the Banner and is considered the devil incarnate in the book.   Wynand, the individualist backs Roark, whom the former considers a genius.  Keating is given an assignment by Roark to build Courtland, a school for severely disadvantaged children, as long as Keating promises not change anything in the design.  Courtland is going to be erected to satisfy the need of a certain segment of society, which, naturally goes against the grain of Rand's anti-altruistic philosophy.    What happens to Courtlandis quite shocking and Roark goes to trial for it.  Wynand initially supports Roark and is then forced to abandon Roark when Wynand's employees are so incensed by Wynand's policy that they strike.  Wynand must compromise some of his ideals, including rehiring certain hated collectivist and altruistic individuals.  Wynand, who thoroughly dislikes Roark by this time, asks the latter to build a monument to Wynand, who knew that he does not have the courage and imagination of Roark to accomplish all that Wynand honored.    This is a very powerfully written novel, with lots of interesting and well developed characterizations.  I do not necessarily agree with Rand's philosophy and believe that she saw the world too much in all or nothing, black and white terms.  The book deservedly has become a huge best seller throughout the years since it was published, and will continue to engender heated debate on both sides of the issue.
0307383415|1.0|The ordeal that many reviewers who subserviently brownnose Obama experience is confusing what \\"Dreams From My Father\\" accomplishes; Obama's 1995 book DOESN'T in any form come close to qualifying him as presidential material. Shame on the reviewers for abusing a book which tells his mediocre life story from childhood to 33 as the basis for endorsing him!!!! Because of the hype instigated by the liberal media for their favorite mulatto (liberal wet dream of theoretically having the first, sort-of \\"black\\" man installed as president), this book's selling aggressively, but in a just world, \\"Dreams From My Father\\" should've continued to be relegated to the obscurity it enjoyed before.<br /><br />This book actively makes the case AGAINST Obama ever becoming president as it fails to present him and his unsatisfactory values in any decent light. I'm in the majority of the country--excluding the 35% of blindly worshipping Democrats who hype Obama due to the misconception they owe the black community for slavery by exalting Obama--which is mystified by the insincere sensationalism surrounding Obama. I picked up this book to investigate this empty suit, yet what I discovered was Obama's substanceless character and disappointment at his ideology and \\"values!!!!\\"<br /><br />I contemptuously distrust that many of the fanatics giving 5-star reviews to Dreams From My Father have actually read the book (probably all Democrat operatives). The book is a disturbing confession of a racially mixed individual with so much emotional baggage that he's ideological, divisive, self-hating, race-hustling, and mistrustful of the goodness that is America. An example of his ideology is he spends much of the book pushing organizing instead of telling blacks to get a better education to increase their pay; his divisiveness is his association with reverse racism which looks at the destiny of blacks as controlled by whites; his self-hate is he actually compares life of the poor in America with the impoverished masses in Kenya; his race-hustling is his choice to associate almost exclusively with blacks (throughout high school, college, inner-city organizing); and his mistrustfulness in America is his longing to connect with African heritage instead of considering himself American foremost.<br /><br />Much of the book is untrustworthy as Obama presumptuously fakes he's able to remember exact quotes in conversations he's had going back to his childhood!!!! This is simply not plausible, so many personal conversations Obama recounts cannot be believed based on only his memory. Another undesirable sickness his book perpetrates is the unabashed swearing Obama writes down, supposedly recollections from personal conversations, especially blacks in low-class neighborhoods. Nonetheless, this is egregious, repelling the reader.<br /><br />The premise of Dreams From My Father is so unrighteous that it's skewed: it's an homage to his Muslim father, but his father is unmasked as an exorbitantly dislikeable renegade!!!! His dad is culpable for abandoning Obama's white mother and him at an early age; fathering scores of children in Kenya; being a drunk and abusive husband/father when he was ostracized from the Kenyan government's favor; and dying practically penniless without leaving his family anything.<br /><br />His father's ignominious memory begs the question why Obama would write a book expressing such yearning for his father and his African heritage, yet the answer is found in reverse racism. Obama doesn't consider himself mulatto; he militantly views himself 100% black. This is desecration considering the whites in his life--Grampa, Toots, his mother--took care of him!!!!<br /><br />Obama's personal \\"values\\" system is quite bankrupt since as a young kid growing up in Hawaii, his coarse Gramps took him to bars in the red light district. Predictably, this damage provoked him to do cocaine and heroin, which he admits on page 87 of his revelatory autobiography.<br /><br />Some of the most anguishing testimony comes during his college \\"career\\"--he never mentions getting an undergraduate degree, yet purports that he had a personal secretary while working as a financial writer in his early 20s!--and working to \\"organize\\" black communities in Chicago. This favoritism for blacks was from his father's abandonment and Obama's yearning to get close to his father by associating with blacks exclusively. Being the far-left liberal he is, Obama's primary strategies as a community organizer wasn't telling blacks to get a better education to improve their financial situation. It was menacingly getting churches, black groups and unions together to intimidate the local government to dole out money, the quintessential, Democratic strategy for anything!!!!<br /><br />Obama's book has misleadingly connected with liberals/progressive sheeple because it's so sappily melodramatic and pretentious. It agonizingly recounts Obama's sob-story of being racially mixed and feeling empty due to his father's absence; this doesn't make him presidential material, only arrogant to assume he's more special than other mixed-race offspring. Obama's shoddy talent does lie in fiction-writing as his style is very rich in vocabulary, complex sentences and scene-setting. Democrats in their moral relativism find this acceptable enough to exaggerate Obama as presidential material (LOL!!!!). The cover caption by Marian Wright Edelman is deceptive as this book WILL NOT TELL YOU ANYTHING about yourself whether you're black or white!!!!ege \\"career\\"--he never mentions getting an undergraduate degree, yet purports that he had a personal secretary while working as a financial writer in his early 20s!--and working to \\"organize\\" black communities in Chicago.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|A satisfying conclusion to the trilogy? That would be like crediting \\"The Matrix\\" with a satisfying level of originality.     Everything the makers, cast and crew have learned about what makes the Bourne formula tick, and click, is revved to supercharged perfection in this pinnacle of a movie.     More is not always better (Matrix 2?), but with careful attention to detail and a plot that works like a Rolex, Ultimatum's unrelenting pace never feels overblown. Matt Damon's impenetrable oasis of razor focus and quiet, seething menace, now seeming to melt glass, finds a new level of counterpoint in this movie. Damon has become so riveting in this role, it's almost possible to overlook the stellar cast around him, matching step for step in a multi-threaded, multi-tiered, multi-national locomotive of twists and action played out with the orchestration of a Beethoven score.    There's something just plain admirable about a movie franchise which insists on digging deeper, finding something more, when a cruise-control third installment would have sufficed and certainly made bank anyway.
1582701709|3.0|I can't say that I totally disliked this book, but I can definitely say that I didn't love it.    The premise of having a positive outlook on goals/life/circumstances is definitely one that will make anyone's life easier.  There's something to be said about how you adversely affect yourself when you focus on negativity.  Like they say...\\"focus on the good stuff.\\"  I have made more of an effort to stay positive, not focus on things I can't change and limit my exposure to negative people.      However, from an analytical perspective the thing that jumped out at me most was the marketing of The Secret.  From a marketing-success standpoint I think there's no arguing that it earned an A+ for effectiveness.  By making it seem like a mystical \\"secret\\" has finally been uncovered and unlocked after all these centries, the marketing makes it seem that by reading this we will be part of the secret society...joining well-known historical figues who knew this priviledged information.   I think down in the 1-2 star range there is a review called something like \\"The review they didn't want you to read\\".  This is a pretty comprehensive look at the principles behind this book's marketing technique and worth checking out.    Additionally, off the top of my head there were some points in the book that bugged me.  At one point a narrator was mentioning money.  That he visualized money and all of a sudden he was receiving checks for no apparent reason.  Whatever.... In the audio CD version of the book he sounded just like an infomercial.   Someone else in another review also spoked about the point in the book where it basically said you should shun people who are fat.  What??  Lastly, one narrator mentioned that he always gets good parking spaces.  Again, whatever...    For anyone who is interested in reading the book, I say go ahead.  But...don't be swallowed by the mystical-marketing spin and take it for what the base message is.  Focus on positive thoughts/goals and that will help your life be more positive.  If that makes you more aware of positive things, then that's great.    I would recommend getting it from the library (sorry Amazon) and then deciding if you want to have it as part of your personal libray.

0670018651|5.0|This book is wonderful.  The wealth of useful information on the nature of perfume; men's (\\"The fragrances seem to be a punishment for trying, a punishment for the guy who dares to dab on\\" Tania Sanchez), women's (Luca Turin - \\"What has changed, and not for the better is the shift from symphony to jingle.\\") is coupled with the joyful and penetrating reactions of the individual perfume reviews.  By the end of the review section you have become a participant, feeling the joy of Tania's \\"Wear this fragrance and feel the cloudless sky rush far away above you.\\" (L'Air du Desert Marocain- Tauer), and Luca's \\"Hilariously vile 50/50 mix of cheap shampoo and canned peaches\\". (Heiress - Paris Hilton)  The writing is vivid and fun, both author's enthusiasm for perfume is evident as well as their ability to home in on (any) vital characteristics of a scent.  This is a book to simply enjoy; separate it from perfumes entirely and it is still a page-turning thrill.  Coupled with the perfumes it becomes a 3-D adventure and a wonder of description.  Sheer fun!

B000T05R8Q|5.0|Whilst today stereo is the norm, in 1967 it was a small minority market and much more time was lavished on the monaural version than on the stereo mix, which would be done in a day or two, after the mono master had been completed, and was often not released until after the standard mono version. Consequently, there were often significant differences between the two. I can remember spending far too many teenage hours comparing mono and stereo versions of albums by the Beatles, the Pink Floyd and others on headphones using a customized mono record player with a stereo cartridge wired to a second amplifier. To me, a psychedelic record such as Piper cried out for stereo effects, and thanks to the crisp production of the late Norman Smith and the sound engineering of Peter Bown at Abbey Road, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />It was an exciting time at Abbey Road, too, as the Beatles were ensconced at the same time in another studio working on Sergeant Pepper, and met the Floyd while they were working on Pow R Toc H. The Pretty Things also started work on SF Sorrow there, again with Norman Smith (who also engineered Sergeant Pepper), before the Floyd's sessions were complete.<br /><br />Piper was the only album that Syd Barrett made in full with the Floyd. He wrote eight of the nine songs and contributed his unique space guitar flourishes to Interstellar Overdrive and the noodly Pow R Toc H. Piper At The Gates Of Dawn is really a benchmark album of the genre now known as psyche. Roger Waters may now dismiss it as juvenilia, but I still listen to it more often than is probably healthy.<br /><br />The stereo version has been newly remastered for this edition, and sounds superb. A mono version of the album has been out before, but this is apparently the first time the authentic mono mix as on the original vinyl album has been remastered, and it clocks in some seventeen seconds longer than the new stereo re-master. In particular it seems an edit of Flaming (used as an American single which had The Gnome on the flipside) was used in error on some mono editions, though at 2.43 now it is barely a second longer than the 1997 mono CD version that I already had, but though I wonder now in what way the 1997 edition did differ from the original album and why, I certainly have no complaints with the 2007 re-mastering.<br /><br />The bonus disc is probably the strongest bait to attract the Pink Floyd enthusiast. It is logical that it should contain the five tracks released on singles that year (the sixth, Scarecrow, was taken from the album), and it is good to have them in catalogue again, but many collectors will already have these on the 6-track mini-LP released in 1997 or from the Shine On 1992 box set. They collect in one place all the released material that feature Syd Barrett, apart from the three tracks on A Saucerful Of Secrets.<br /><br />The real treats here are the final four tracks. The French Edit of Interstellar Overdrive is a substantially re-mixed mono version of Take Two (the one used on the album) of Interstellar Overdrive, unheard since it first turned up on the French EP of Arnold Layne in 1967, and the CD also includes Take Six, a previously unreleased take recorded three weeks later, which shows the extent of variation between performances of this largely improvised piece, and is great to have. There's a rare stereo mix of the extraordinary Apples And Oranges single, too, which is said to be previously unissued but might be the same as the one on the French vinyl LP The Best Of The Pink Floyd; and finally an unreleased early version of Matilda Mother, recorded at their first Abbey Road session. The song was inspired by Hilaire Belloc's Cautionary Tales and this version has lyrics that were changed on the released version, possibly to avoid copyright problems. Obviously missing are the unreleased gems Vegetable Man and Scream Thy Last Scream, although as these were recorded for a potential single for release in 1968, long after Piper had been released, they could just as justifiably be included on an edition of A Saucerful Of Secrets.<br /><br />The packaging is nice and glossy and has a facsimile of a booklet of Syd's art collage notebook as well as photos and album lyrics. Given that the primary market for a package such as this must be the avid collector, the booklet surprisingly lacks any technical details at all about the mixes, recording dates, sources and so forth.<br /><br />This clearly is the definitive ultimate edition of Pink Floyd's debut album, until the next re-issue of it, and corrects the shortcomings of previous releases that most of us hadn't been aware of. Cynicism aside, this is an important sixties album for a number of reasons and deserves to be heard in both mono and stereo mixes, and the bonus disc and lavish packaging make it a considerable treat, especially for collectors.just as justifiably be included on an edition of A Saucerful Of Secrets.

B000H1RFKU|5.0|Although we are used to seeing Denzel cast in heroic \\"good guy\\" roles, his portrayal of a corrupt narcotics officer brings forth one of his finest acting performances.  As many other reviewers have already stated quite well, the chemistry between Denzel and Ethan Hawk who plays a \\"Newbie\\" cop trying to make it into the unit run by Alonzo Harris (Denzel's character) is captivating from the start of the day when the two meet over breakfast.    Being one of my favorite movies, when I saw it had been released on Blu-Ray, I had to buy it again.  I am very glad that I did.  The Blu-Ray version gives an added dimension to Antoine Fuqua's views of LA's streets, and brings them to life as if you are ridding with them in Denzel's Malibu - as he says \\"You're in the office, baby.\\"  Blu-ray brings the environments into focus with as much passion and detail as Antoine put into his directing - you can almost smell the rain-soaked streets and feel the pulse of the city.   If you'd like to experience a \\"real-life, close-up tour of LA\\" as you watch a truly deserving Academy Award winning film, I recommend you buy the Blu-Ray version - it will not disapoint.

B000YCLRBA|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hvorostovsky in this lead role with the Lyric Opera of Chicago this season.  However, nothing would have topped the experience of seeing this live production of Eugene Onegin by the Metropolitan Opera.  This production had a solid lead cast along with one of the best Tchaikovsky conductors out there.  Hvorostovsky and Fleming have great chemistry on stage.  The last tweleve minutes of the opera alone are worth the purchase of this dual disc.  You really get wrapped up in the experience. Vargas brings tears to your eyes with his rendition of Lenski's Aria.  If you're a fan of Tchaikovsky, beautiful music and a great story line, you'll love this opera.  The bonus footage is a huge plus as well.  I loved the orchestra rehearsal footage with Maestro Gergiev and the late great Beverly Sills interview backstage with Hvorostovsky and Fleming.  This would be a great addition to any opera fans collection.  Enjoy!
B000BPG2JC|4.0|A flawed sheriff struggles with grief that he tries to drown in booze, and with murder that might have been accidental -- except that it happens again. As he tries to avoid sinking into the morass of alcoholic self-pity, he must also locate a murderer and save his wounded friend from a snarling blizzard.<br /><br />Stated that baldly, _The Cold Dish_ might be taken for melodrama, but Craig Johnson makes it real and plausible. Even the guidance Sheriff Longmire receives from native spirits which a reader might take for real or a hallucination, is logically motivated and believable.<br /><br />A modern Western mystery, the characters in this multi-faceted novel are shaped by the area they live in -- the Absaroka region of Wyoming, and by the sometimes uneasy coexistence of white and native people.<br /><br />An impressive debut, and a good novel as well as an engrossing mystery, one I had a tough time putting down.<br /><br />(In order for a book to receive 5 stars, it has to rise to the level of literature and be free of annoying errors such as typos in the production.)

B000UJ48VI|4.0|There's always been a pall of prurience over Vladimir Nabokov's [[ASIN:0141182539 classic 1955 novel]], and although the prurience was dialed down to mere naughtiness in the 1962 film adaptation, there is still that discomforting feeling of watching two pedophiliacs chasing after a very young girl. However, master director Stanley Kubrick wisely left out the book's more controversial aspects and entrusted the audience to use their fervent imaginations to fill in the action. This explains why the title character, a twelve-year-old nymphet in the book, has turned into a fifteen-year old screen siren played by an already anatomically developed, throaty-voiced Sue Lyon. The switch neutralizes some of the dramatic impact, but fortunately, Kubrick was able to elicit a quartet of fine performances to carry the story. Even though Nabokov is credited with the screenplay, Kubrick made a number of revisions to clarify the narrative flow and appease the censors. The result is far too long at 153 minutes, but it's still provocatively entertaining as it alternates between funny and eccentric. It's well worth seeing the caliber of Kubrick's cinematic work between 1960's [[ASIN:0783226039 Spartacus]] and 1964's [[ASIN:B0002XNSY0 Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]].<br /><br />The film opens with a shooting which we soon realize is the story's inevitable climax. After that, we flash back four years to the arrival of Professor Humbert Humbert in a small town in New Hampshire. A middle-aged British lecturer of French poetry, he has accepted a teaching job in Ohio for the fall and wants to relax in what he envisions to be a quiet setting for the summer. Humbert rents a room from Charlotte Haze, a blowsy, fortyish widow with immediate designs on him. However, his eye is drawn to her sexy, flirtatious daughter Lolita. Things go awry when Humbert decides to marry Charlotte to be near Lolita. When his true motivation is discovered, tragedy occurs, and Humbert and Lolita set out on a most acrimonious road trip to Ohio. Complications multiply with the periodic appearances of writer Claire Quilty, who also faces temptation with Lolita. For those unfamiliar with the novel, the story takes a surprising twist toward the end.<br /><br />As Humbert, James Mason has the riskiest role, but he effectively manages to convey a dangerous sense of obsession throughout the film. Although his character is basically despicable, Mason still elicits a modicum of sympathy for his perverse weakness. Sue Lyon, fourteen during filming, not only looks right but also brings the necessary combination of precocious confidence and childish selfishness to the title role. You can see echoes of their taboo relationship between Lester and Angela in Sam Mendes' [[ASIN:B00003CWL6 American Beauty]]. Donning a variety of disguises as Quilty and sporting a flat American accent, Peter Sellers easily steals all his scenes with comic malevolence. The surprising standout is Shelley Winters' performance as Charlotte. Instead of overdoing the character's desperation as you would normally expect from the actress' outsized persona, she is comparatively subtle in conveying Charlotte's needy nature. The only significant extra with the 2007 DVD is the original theatrical trailer which plays up the book's controversy.Lolita set out on a most acrimonious road trip to Ohio.

B00005K3O0|3.0|The Templeton family has a shadow.  Seems like every time Bill (John Beck) or Janice (Marsha Mason) turn around, they see a bearded man following them. Finally Elliott Hoover (Hopkins) arranges a meeting with them.     It seems he believes their daughter, Ivy (Susan Swift) is the reincarnation of his own child, Audrey Rose. Soon enough, Ivy's psychic symptoms bear this out.  She's having dreams of events that never happened--and burns are appearing on her hands.      You see, Audrey Rose Hoover was trapped in a wrecked car that caught fire and couldn't free herself.     The good points of this film is the acting by Hopkins and Swift.  Anthony Hopkins is a somber, sad man who is desperately trying to help his own child's soul. Swift does an amazing portrayal of a young girl haunted by a past she cannot remember.  I would not call the sound and video of this DVD a 'loving rendition'. Both are mediocre to say the least.      If you enjoy 60's and 70's horror like, \\"The Exorcist,\\" \\"Rosemary's Baby,\\" \\"The Bad Seed\\", \\"The Omen,\\" \\"Reincarnation of Peter Proud,\\" you are going to enjoy this film.  I hope at some point, the producers at United Artists will do a better job of digitizing the video and audio for DVD.
6304712499|2.0|Another great comic book character ruined by a terrible movie adaptation.<br /><br />Premise: Just like the comic book. Al Simmons is an ex-government agent who gets killed by his boss's underling during his final hit. He goes to hell and makes a deal with Malebogia that he would lead his Malebogia's army if he gets to see his wife Wanda(played by the brutally gorgeous Theresa Randall) again. Violator is ordered to keep an eye on Spawn to make sure he follows through on his promise.<br /><br />Opinion: This movie could have been great so what went wrong? Miscast. Michael Jai White is perfect as Spawn but whoever thought that John Leguizamo made a perfect Violator needs a swift kick in the rear end. Granted that Violator is an annoying creep in the comic book but John Leguizamo makes him more cartoonish and goofy than the comic book ever did! Martin Sheen is usually good but he was not at his best in this movie. His performance was kind of questionable. I gave it two stars because its okay at times like Spawn's battle with Violator and Spawn crashing in on his former boss at a banquet. Other than that the script is weak and kind of does a disservice to the Todd Mcfarlane classic. If you want the real Spawn check out the animated series. Its leaps and bounds over this New Line Cinema tragedy.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the lore of the Zodiac. As a person highly interested in the history of this highly publicized unsolved case it was painful to suffer through the weak attempts over the past few years t make a true zodiac movie. The movie was great on all levels, I had to watch it again and again. Naturally, when this 2-disc set came out I had to get it also because it has interviews with people that knew the primary suspect as well as the victims. Spoiler alter coming... One interview in particular struck me as very strange. I am sure that many people that picked this DVD up are wondering... since Leigh Allen's DNA did not match the Zodiac's... is this guy they are interviewing on this DVD (an acquaintance of Leigh) is actually the Zodiac.. a free man walking the streets today
B00154GEFU|5.0|There were three absolutes in this world: death, taxes, and the fact that all 4 members of Asia would never play together again.  Had you asked anyone in the know they'd have told you that by all indicators, there will never be an Asia reunion.  Never.  If they tell you different now, they're lying.  This is the one reunion that wasn't supposed to happen, let alone a full length studio album of new material.    At one point, Wetton had confronted Downes with the assertion that the Payne Asia was not \\"the spirit of Asia.\\"  Downes reply was that \\"the spirit of Asia\\" had been dissembodied long before then, somewhere back when the Alpha effort broke apart.  Truth be told, they were both right.  No matter what the name or incarnation, we've not experienced the synergy of these 4 members since some time in 1983.    On Phoenix, \\"the spirit of Asia\\" is present.  That's the best endorsement I can give for this album.  Frustrated magazine critics like to quip that \\"this song is a cheap sister to that,\\" and \\"this song is a poor cousin to that song,\\" and \\"they were trying to imitate such and such.\\"  In my opinion, this album is so good that it's confusing.  It's confusing because people didn't know what to expect, I suppose not even the band themselves.  Maybe the greatest thing about this album is the fact that they did their due diligence and felt their way through authentic material.  Yes, there is some formula, but in large part the art of the 4 members is on display.  The pre-release sound clips were great, but they just don't do it.  Listening to the entire piece of work lets you really get your arms around the concept that these guys are an ensemble.  With all four of them, the whole is definitely greater that the sum of its parts.  You have to listen to the album itself to get that.    Given the pressure of 25 years and the success of Asia Asia, I was actually afraid of a lethargic and robotic release.  That's not what we got.  This is an album that when you sit down and listen to it straight through(when's the last time you did that with any album), you don't even think about what it set you back to buy it.  Courageous.  Sincerely, Bravo.  That's the good news for the band.  Now the bad news:  25 years between albums will just not due any more, we'll expect an offering every year and a half to two years.  It's been too long!  But well worth it!
0061120081|5.0|Some books so fluidly transcend the stories they contain that the characters and setting almost become incidental to the universal themes they express without contrivance. Such a book exists in Harper Lee's masterful 1960 novel, one of the most revered pieces of fiction this country has ever produced. Set in rural, Depression-era Alabama, it is a classic coming-of-age story about a precocious nine-year old tomboy named Scout. What she experiences is palpable in the virulent racism surrounding the persecution of Tom Robinson, a black man unjustly accused of raping Mayella, the abused white daughter of an unrepentant bigot, Bob Ewell. Representing Tom in court is Atticus Finch, Scout's father and the moral compass of the story.<br /><br />The plot moves toward a deepening exploration of the intractable conflict between tolerance and ignorance and how the pre-existing environment of hatred and mistrust makes innocent people guilty by pure circumstance. Scout embodies these themes within her own journey toward womanhood and her questions of what society expects of her. Through the travails of Tom and the town's outcast, Boo Radley, and primarily through her father's example, Scout recognizes how innate goodness can exist even in the direst circumstances. Likely because the story is semi-autobiographical, Lee is able to vividly capture the rural south and the pervasive mindset during the Depression with spellbinding accuracy. Yet for all that, the book's lasting legacy has more to do with Lee's particular lierary gift in bringing a genuine universality to her themes.<br /><br />Other characters weave in and out of the story - including Dill, Scout's wannabe boyfriend and the Truman Capote doppelganger - and each plays a key role in shaping the novel's core conflicts. I have to say that the author's particular literary strengths come to the fore in her empathetic depictions of the evolving relationships between these characters, for example, Scout and her father Atticus, Scout and her brother Jem, the children and Boo. Nothing seems extraneous in the story Lee tells, no small feat for a 336-page novel. She brings intense emotion to her prose, especially in describing the uncontrollable fury created by racial hatred and false accusations, for instance, in the lynch mob scene before the trial and in the vengeful attack on the children. The timing of the book's original 1960 publication turned out to be prescient, as the Civil Rights movement was just becoming national in scope thanks to the efforts of Martin Luther King and his brethren. Even if you have seen the masterful [[ASIN:0783225857 1962 film]], you owe it to yourself to read Lee's literary masterwork and sadly the only novel she ever wrote.brother Jem, the children and Boo.

Though he was faced with many hurdles, he ultimately didn't back down for what was right! This man changed history and saved thousands of lives. His story was beautifully done with amazing acting and scenery. YES!

The mix is superb, the sound engineer did an amazing job, and this just f...ing sounds great.. What a waste not putting out this music over the last 23 years.  The same can not be said to the latest Rush live cd, which is the complete opposite: horrendous sound quality, the mix is poor, muddy, not sure what the sound board was doing those 2 nights..  back to Asia: from the first licks of the first tracks, it just grooves.. and flows all the way to Wettons seeming sentimental last song on the disc (which I predict will become a new Asia anthem and possible and unfortunately a \\"pop\\" hit  the musicianship is impeccable...the rhythm section is right on...  I only wished all new rock/ indie rock cds produced in the modern era sounded this good...  this is what my martin logan speakers were made for..  look forward to the upcoming tour...

B00154GEFU|3.0|Having fallen under the Asia spell in 1982 when I heard 'Only Time Will Tell', I became an Asia fan right from that day to today, buying every album.  Some were good, some were poor, a few were exceptional.<br /><br />When the news broke the original 4 were getting together I was excited; the Wetton vocal incarnation to me was superior to the Payne and I truly missed John Wetton's voice on Asia tracks.  When a new album was due to be released I went into a foment and got it the day it was released.<br /><br />Some tracks were good, some poor and others superior.  Rather like the Asia life story to be honest.  I welcomed Wetton's voice back and the polished, confident sound these four professionals produce.  But as a whole, the album fell short of what I hoped for.  Why?  Too many 'soft' tracks and not enough of the rocking style I enjoyed on 'Asia' and to a degree on 'Alpha'.  This was a bit like 'Astra' where it began with bang and tailed away, to end with a better track.<br /><br />Phoenix is something like that.  'Never Again' is a classic Asia style composition, strong, gutsy and melodic.  It took me right back to the early 80s.  We then have two gentler tracks with 'Nothing's Forever' and 'Heroine'.  I'd rather have one of those two here followed by somethign with more go in it.  'Nothing Forever' is right out of the Yes stable with a vocal start followed by a discordant organ sound.  'Herione' is a nice enough track but doesn't really ignite my interest; it would have sounded better sandwiched between two harder sounding tracks.<br /><br />We then have one of the 8 minute tracks made up of three parts - 'Sleeping Giant/No Way Back/reprise'.  This is interesting and proggy, with a haunting start and then a strident middle part.  After this comes 'Alibis', which to me is one of the better compositions, and its no surprise to learn this was an 80s track rewritten for this album.  Its got a catchy beat and ends with a fascinating pseudo-Tudoresque sound.<br /><br />The middle part of the album bogs down into a samey blandness which is regrettable.  Nothing really stands out as a classic in its own right; 'I will Remember You' is another nice track but not something I'll remember, and then we have 'Shadow of a Doubt', a track that begins with promise but then sinks into mediocrity before coming back to life with a catchy chorus line.  Indicative of the whole album in a way.  Its a song that gets better the further along it goes.<br /><br />The second 8 minute three part offering of 'Parallel Worlds/Vortex/Deya' moves along smoothly enough but again doesn't really grab you.  Its a track to listen to in the dead of night relaxing and not thinking of anything.  Great atmospheric music and one for a mellow frame of mind.<br /><br />Then comes Steve Howe's composition 'Wish I'd Known All Along'.  Howe is a brilliant guitarist but sadly I don't think his songwriting matches it.  The melody is too discordant for my taste.  After that comes a real gem, 'Orchard of Mines'.  What a fantastically composed track, beautifully made for Wetton's voice.  It just builds and builds and is sung how a song should be.  One of the best on the album.<br /><br />'Over and Over' follows and its the weakest on the album - it could be put to an Italian sauce advert and nobody would bat an eyelid.  Not good enough in my opinion for an Asia album.  Thankfully things pick up with the superb 'Extraordinary Life'.  This track gave me goosebumps when I heard it, Howe's guitar riffs and segues were sublime, surely indicative of how talented this man is on the guitar.  The song builds in a brilliant way too and has passion from Wetton who knows what its all about.<br /><br />Overall 3 stars, mainly due to the flat middle part of the album.  I would like to see more songs with guts and go about them to balance it from the overly soft feel to this album, but all the same its a fairly good one that I'll play repeatedly - missing out a few tracks of course!into a samey blandness which is regrettable.

This creative piece shows they can rock with intelligence, without selling out!    The energy hits you in the face.. Then read the lyrics which will bring the songs to a new dimension. Add the guitars, bass and harmonies, you've got a complete package!    The CD debuted number \\"2\\", selling more than 400,000 copies, that tells us something...(Help keep the momentum going !!)
1430300612|2.0|This book was a bit too far out on a limb for me.  The spiritual side of having a stroke, while interesting, was not what I was interested in.  It seems the author made a tremendous journey from being a left-brained analytical scientist to a right-brain warm and fuzzy humanist.  Interesting reading, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone needing information from a caregiver's perspective or anyone interested in helpful information on stroke recovery.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I enjoyed this installment of HP first in the theater and have relived it on DVD several times since.

I would highly recommend reading the book after to see what you missed!
B0007YXQRI|2.0|This is not a true DVD-AUDIO... normally, the point of a DVD-A formatted disc is to remix the original album in 5.1 surround, playable on dvd-a players or dvd players with 5.1 surround sound.  This is NOT the case... this is merely a higher quality recording (higher bit-rate) disc of a classic coltrane album.    If you don't already own this album, you should get it.  but if you already own the \\"regular\\" cd, this is not what you probably want.
B00127RAJY|5.0|After watching a few season's of The Biggest Loser, but being really into this last \\"Couples\\" season, I decided to try one of Jillian's workouts.  I have already lost 30lbs and have about another 15 I until I reach my goal, so I thought it's time to step it up a notch.  I've been working out 5-6 days a week doing a mix of high & low impact aerobics in 45 minute sessions.  I considered myself to be at an intermediate level since I have been doing this consistently for a couple months now.    WOW!    I was literally shaking for about 30 minutes after I finished the workout and I only did Level 1.  You will feel this in every inch of your body.  It is an absolute amazing workout and I cannot wait to see the results.  The next day my legs were so sore I had trouble going down the stairs in the morning until I got myself up & moving a little more.  Her combination of Strength, Cardio & Abs is unreal.  I literally can feel  every muscle has been worked, expecially the quads, biceps, pecs & abs.  The second day was actually worse, so I know I got a great workout.      I would highly recommend this workout to anyone who is looking to lose weight, inches, & gain muscle.  I do not believe this would be for a beginner to do 5 days a week, but could be incorporated into your weekly routine.  I will continue to use this workout at least 3 days a week, as well as continue my aerobics so my body does not get used to the same workout.
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|For those of us who grew up with R.E.M. in the eighties and nineties, the hope would be for a return to form of one of our favorite bands. Unfortunately, R.E.M.'s latest effort is mediocre at best.  Sure, there are a couple of highlights--\\"Supernatural Superserious\\" and \\"Horse to Water\\" are decent tunes, though by no means up to R.E.M.'s best, or even the best of current music.  More disturbing to me is that several of the songs seem bitter and preachy--songs like \\"Man-Sized Wreath\\", the title track, and of course \\"Until The Day Is Done\\".  Perhaps they have reason to be bitter, but it does not make for enjoyable or enlightening listening.  \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\" is just plain embarrassing and \\"Sing For The Submarine\\" seems to go on forever.   I think in the end they got it right on \\"Hollow Man\\"-- \\"I'm overwhelmed, I'm on repeat, I'm emptied out, I'm incomplete.\\" That sums up Accelerate in a nutshell.
0679731369|2.0|In 1876, writing his last completed novel, Flaubert borrows a stuffed parrot from the Museum of Rouen to grace his desk. The parrot figures in \\"A Simple Heart,\\" but its glowering presence soon irritates him and he sends it back. Today, there are two stuffed parrots in Rouen, each claimed to be the one. So begins Julian Barnes' extended riff on his favorite French author. The very promising spine of this narrative is a detective story about undiscovered letters between Flaubert and his English mistress, involving a Pnin-like academic worthy of Nabokov. But Barnes drops this ball after only two brief segments, and for the rest of his book offers a miscellany for Flaubert buffs: trivia, chronologies, riffs on obscure text points--the content of any famous-author website. In the end, as with the parrot, this reader said: so what? The result is anemic and precious, not compelling or illuminating, and has been greatly over-praised.    For a better sense of Barnes' caliber within this new collage genre, compare it with \\"Was\\" by Geoff Ryman, a lesser-known masterpiece from 1992. Like Barnes, Ryman riffs on a famous author and his work (Frank Baum and the Oz books) but instead of Barnes' lazy doodling, Ryman offers a stunning multi-strand tapestry filled with cinematic drama and complex characters, a book that really takes off, not once but repeatedly. In Barnes, a wan little smoke signal rises above Oxbridge; in Ryman, a fictive tornado sweeps us away.

B0015AARJI|3.0|The best thing about the Dual Shock 3 is that it has caused Amazon to lower the price of the Sixaxis. I have been waiting for this controller to come out so that Amazon and the rest would drop the price of the Sixaxis to a reasonable price. Thanks Sony!    I PERSONALLY all by myself abhor vibrating controllers. So when I found that the PS3 Sixaxis doesn't even have the feature I was very pleased. Even better, the Sixaxis is very lightweight because it doesn't have the motor and weights for the Rumble feature. Very good.    So all in all I am glad for the people who needed the Rumble feature. And if you really like paying US$15 more for the heavier controller, more power to you. I'm happy for my extra Sixaxis at an even lower price.
B000002LQD|4.0|Lou, Lou, Lou.  It's the beginning of a great adventure.  For the fact that Reed's talent is exceeding, this CD is well written, but one somber jaunt of a concept album.  Don't get me wrong.  It's completely Lou to the labored ennui degree.  This might be hard for some to fathom as likable, especially if you are into a bubble gum belief in lifestyle.  But, if you are into listening to some tunes with a heavy gravity to their message, then this is the CD for you.  I enjoy Reed's healthy guitar licks and epic bar cords that guide the tragedy ridden lyrics to what I can only call that traditional Lou Reed sound.  Overtly, it's introspective and at times, a little overbearing in the show tune aspect, but come on,...That's what Reed is best at.  Sublimely, the effort tries to rationalize a friend's untimely passing and catches the myriad of confusing feelings that goes along with that, all of the way to an acceptance of the facts.  Okay.  I like it enough to suggest it to anyone who might have a yen for Lou and maybe those who are currently going thru something emotionally tough.  Magic and Loss is mature and unflinching and as all Reed albums go, it is flavored with the gritty tastes of New York city, proper.  Well worth it.
006135323X|2.0|While this book deals with the fascinating subject of behavioral economics, I cannot rate it as highly as other popular books in the field.    The first problem is that many of the experiments are so artificial (how much would you pay to hear a sound?) that their relationship to real world behavior (adults making decisions about how to spend their LIMITED funds and know that by buying some things they cannot afford others) is dubious at best.    The second recurring problem that the author, Dan Ariely,  often sees irrationality in terms of what he calls \\"market norms\\" (those involving monetary exchange) vs \\"social norms\\" (those involving exchange of other values).   He normally has a bias for \\"social\\" over \\"market norms\\".  This leads him to advise for more government regulations and power to control a greater proportion of national life.    This advice, of course arises from a fatal non-sequitur.  Granting that humans are often irrational, why assume they act rationally when they vote, or that their representatives will support \\"rational\\" policy?   History and most evidence points that political activity of all sorts is MORE irrationally rabid than other human activities.  (Anyone here read a newspaper lately?)    Rather than experiment on \\"market\\" vs \\"social\\" norms, the more interesting experiments in this field have compared \\"voluntary\\" to \\"compulsory\\" norms.  \\"Voluntary\\" actions include the many daily interactions we all have, (exchanging money, love, ideas, trust and so on) usually one on one.  These kinds of activity benefit from all the aspects of spontaneous order (competition, quick adjustment, decentralized decisions, localized failure ....)  \\"Compulsory\\" actions (and all government activity involves compulsion) include experiments on how people make decisions when they have the power to compel (or prevent) others to act, the power to inflict pain, and so on.  These experiments have published very scary results.  No longer need we wonder how normal citizensin 1930's Germany became Nazi monsters.  These actions at a government level suffer from lack of spontaneous order (potentially disastrous failure, centralized control, great difficulty of change and adjustment, ......)      And yet Dan Ariely does not seem to know or see any of this.

If Keith Jarrett should make one hundred more albums like this one, I'd buy every one.  I'd especially like to have Over the Rainbow recorded in a studio without the coughing.  I love just about every song on this album but Shenandoah stands out as the best.  It is a masterpiece.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|I've had this album for over seven years and I never get tired of it. And if you're someone who appreciates good music, neither will you. Whether you're a casual fan, a die hard fan or even just recently a new fan, this will be a very worthy addition. For the new fan, it's the perfect introduction to one of the most influential bands in music. You can actually hear them grow with each track. Yet as superb as this album is, it only scratches the surface. The albums \\"With The Beatles\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and The White Album are not covered because there were no singles off those albums. \\"Nowhere Man\\" from \\"Rubber Soul\\" was released as a single in the U.S. but only went to #3. This underscores the fact that some of their most popular songs didn't top the charts or were not released as singles. For the long time or die hard fan this is worth getting for the packaging. The liner notes feature different picture sleeves for all the singles as well as release dates. Finally, all the tracks except the first three are in stereo.    John, Paul, George and Ringo have definitely left their mark on the world. This collection is proof of that.    Total Time-79:08
B000WTNCYA|5.0|The more I listen, the more I hear, the more I listen.  Looking forward to following her career.  An important new talent.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|I really feel this movie, although it could be slow at times, was quite good.  The acting was great, the cinematography was just stunning, and the story was compelling.<br /><br />The last 30 minutes of the film are my favorite--so intense!<br /><br />I realize this is not a \\"blockbuster\\" movie where everyone could easily enjoy it.  But if you like Paul Thomas Anderson, this movie will please you.  If you haven't seen this movie (or his other films), I advise you to rent it before you buy it, and keep an open mind.<br /><br />Sadly the greeting card style \\"case\\" (using that term kindly) was flimsy and I needed to get another plastic case so the DVD would not become damaged.  But that is my only complaint.  (*Note, I did NOT buy the special edition.)
B0007GBBVO|4.0|ASIN B0007BBVO The Creeps in 3D for your TV - I've waited over a month for this 3D DVD and it was worth waiting for.  This 3D movie is tops in 3D effects though the story is not as much. I wish the audio part of this DVD was in 5.1 surround and not in 2 channel sound.  Overall, I rate this DVD four stars for a very good 3D realism.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Like others I found out about this album after an interview with her on NPR. I immediately bought the album and was hooked.  This IS a fantastic album!  I can't wait for her next release (fingers crossed)!
B000F4RHB6|4.0|This is a recopilation of greatest hits of Huey Lewis and The News. For me, the best songs are \\"The power of love\\" and \\"The heart of rock and roll\\". I recomend this CD for rockers.
015603283X|5.0|The Club Dumas: By Arturo Pérez-Reverte  In my opinion this book was a very entertaining read. I thought the author did a very good job of turning a storyline which many people may not find interesting into something very interesting to the reader. For example the overall story by itself is not all that interesting at first glance, a man who searches for old books, I mean something that I wouldn't find interesting. But with the way that the author presents this as a mystery that if you read will come to learn to be quite suspenseful. This book also talks a lot about past stories or novels as well, for example The Three Musketeers is mentioned a lot. From the beginning of the story you know a lot about the main character Lucas Corso. A man who searches for rare lost in time books. And on this one book search which is connected to a murder he gets more than he bargains for. But anyhow you can read the book to find out. Throughout the book Corso travels all over to different book sellers and searchers like himself in search of the Books of Nine Doors, and others, and through this process you learn a lot about his past relationships with these dealers or people. In a very descriptive way the author puts you in the shoes of Corso and his cunningness to find what he is looking for. If you are a big reader (as I am not) I believe you will enjoy this story even more because it seems that on almost every page there is a literary reference, most of which I have not heard of or ever read but others may have. The story contains a rare mix of adventure, mystery, and literary connections. I highly recommend this book and I enjoyed reading it a lot.
B000P0I4O4|3.0|I'm kinda surprised that names like John Cusack and Morgan Freeman would be associated with such a pedestrian film as this. Then again their names were the only reason I picked this up, so maybe the studio's ploy worked, and it's actually their performances that saved it from being unwatchable.<br /><br />Cusack is having father/son issues with the teen after his wife passes away from cancer. In an attempt to devote some \\"quality time\\" and bond with his son they go on a camping trip in the Washington state wilderness. Unfortunately for them, rogue CIA spook Freeman happens to be en route to prosecution in that area when his mercenary buddies try to free him. The escape scenario doesn't go as smoothly as planned and Freeman ends up in the unwanted \\"custody\\" of Cusack (who just happens to be an ex-cop turned teacher) with the help of an errant handgun. In the middle of the nowhere they look to evade the trailing mercenaries and get to safety.<br /><br />There are way too many implausiblities and cliches in the story to make this a good film (e.g., why wouldn't Cusack just take Freeman's advice and the gun, leave and not put his son in harm's way?). The meeting of the other hiking couple was totally unnecessary and felt tacked on just to try to add some drama at the last scene. The action was OK, but rote and implausible again. But at least we get some nice scenery and decent performances from the leads, so if you're fans of theirs, as I am, you may want to give this a rent.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|Blows away the debut, a real treat to listen to sonically. I would recomend you check out '7' the new cd from Poi Dog Pondering, who had to be a huge influence on these guys........Brilliant!
B0013FXWU6|4.0|Another sterling performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.  I also enjoyed the performance of Paul Dano who brought a very eerie character to Eli.      Only thing I was slightly disappointed in was the ending.  As is usually the case, for me, I will need to watch this film a few more times.      It was certainly a very dark film that brought home the point concerning greed and the fact that extreme wealth and power (oil) 'dirties' everyone and everything it comes into contact with.  Now, I will need to read the novel.      Interesting packaging to the DVD by the way.  Was that due to expediency or 'green' packaging?
B000FVBLEI|4.0|Good band, good songs, really good guitar work. The only downfall is the songs all have such big hooks...that it actually lessens the impact...like the old saying too much of a good thing. A must own, I just hope the guys varry things up a bit, or do a live CD to showcase all the talent without the production gloss....do yourselves a favor and check out Skinlab's new live CD to see what I mean....ton of variety and probably the heaviest thing you have ever heard....with no 'gloss'
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I LOVE this CD.  Sara has an amazing ability to bring the soothing rock and uplifting rock together in a twist of talent.  I would suggest this CD to anyone.
B000VI70WM|4.0|A rather surprisingly strong effort, however the various styles represented on here don't flow that well at times. Rather than being seamless, they feel a bit forced. The melodies are strong throughout, it's just the musical side that seems perhaps a bit too ambitious. I would recomend the new '7' Cd by Poi Dog Pondering for an amazing example at seamlessly blending styles.
B000050FEN|5.0|David Fincher is probably one of the greatest directors we have working today.  He has a distinct style and presence with each of his films that goes unmatched by anyone else in the business.  Even his weaker fare like `Panic Room' still has such sharp and masterful texture to it; you can't help but admire his talent.  `Se7en' most definitely is his finest film; a true testament to his marvelous gift.  Hailed as the greatest crime thriller since `The Silence of the Lamb', `Se7en' may very well be the greatest crime thriller period.  Fincher touch elevates this gritty and quite disturbing picture even past the likes of `...Silence...' and creates something never before seen or experienced.  `Se7en' digs deep beneath the skin and festers.<br /><br />In `Se7en' Fincher takes us into the heart of sin; deadly sin for that matter.  The film focuses on two detectives, Mills and Somerset, as they track down a serial killer stalking their city.  Somerset is about to retire while Mills is going to be his replacement.  The two of them don't necessarily see eye-to-eye on the outset, but their involvement in the case brings them closer together.  The killer, who for the most part remains out of sight, strings along these detectives in an elaborate game of cat-and-mouse, leading up to the most shocking of conclusions in cinematic history (yes, the ending is a real mind-blower).<br /><br />As the films title would suggest, this `killer' strikes those involved in one of the seven deadly sins, namely gluttony, greed, lust, envy, sloth, wrath and vanity.  This premise leads for some extremely creative, not to mention spine chilling, crime scenes put on film.<br /><br />The benefit to such an intricate and perverse premise is that it allows morality to have a role in the growth of the film.  As the killer strikes time and time again we see the filth of society being victimized; the same type of individuals that do their fare share of victimizing.  The motives and views of the killer are made to take front and center as he expresses his `faith' in savage ways.  `Se7en' is smart enough to give the audience a reason to be truly scared.  Rather than having a lunatic randomly stalking and murdering hot young girls, Fincher and crew have created a killer who has a distinct target, a target that incorporates each and every living breathing human.<br /><br />We all sin; don't we?<br /><br />One thing that impressed me from the very beginning was the creativity and originality that went into the script.  The film is very fresh, especially when you consider the recycled garbage that gets passed around in this particular film genre these days.  It seems that each and every `horror' director out there wants to use the same clich&eacute;d sequences within their films to try and elicit some sort of fearful reaction from the audience.  Not so with `Se7en'.  Fincher has masterfully crafted a film that uses its head; that creates a mood and seeps slowly yet savagely into the viewers mind and starts to pick away at their sanity from the inside out.<br /><br />That mood is perfectly matched by the brilliant performances captured on screen.  Morgan Freeman delivers a very controlled and mannered performance as the wise Detective Somerset.  His performance is complemented beautifully by Brad Pitt's effortless portrayal of the gruff Detective Mills.  Pitt, who is often considered a pretty boy, really digs down and draws out perfection from this character.  Pitt, like DiCaprio, is one of those actors cursed by the pretty stick, but he has equally proven himself a dedicated and talented actor.  Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful as Mill's doting wife Tracy; but it is one other man who really steals the show.  Kevin Spacey has never been better in my humble opinion.  As `John Doe' he fleshes out pure terror.  His final frames are those `hold your breath' frames, where time stops and blood runs cold and everything around you begins to crush inward.<br /><br />`Se7en', as you can tell, is one of my favorite films.  The quote-unquote `horror' genre all too often suffers from unoriginality and a total lack of imagination.  `Se7en' is the supreme antidote.  It is gritty, disturbing and haunting to the core.  Quote honestly, if you are looking for an effective crime thriller then there is no better place to go.horror' genre all too often suffers from unoriginality and a total lack of imagination.  `Se7en' is the supreme antidote.

B000N3ST9I|4.0|The most Hyped CD of the last 5-10 years...good for them. After being ignored by the label and blatantly mistreated, it's nice to see the label generated a mountain of great press to get back on the band's good side. Forget the hype, it is what it is...a record that from start to finish is pretty hard to beat.......couldn't believe somebody mentioned Fozzy? Not even the same style of music, really....but I have to agree that Fozzy All that Remains Reloaded CD is incredible! Just don't really think we should compare the 2 bands. (but check it out! you won't believe how good y2J the wrestler can sing)
0307388840|2.0|I won't offer a plot summary that can be found in other book reviews. I'll offer my frank opinion that this book is over-rated and destined for the literary dustbin. \\"Atonement\\" is a cramped miniaturist piece that aspires to something greater, particularly in its commentary about written narrative, but ultimately, the major plot points boil down to the warped opinions of an adolescent mind. Lies, false accusations, fanciful opinions, need for drama--all products of a prepubescent's girl's mind. And unfortunately, a rather likable student is sent to war, separating him from his true love, because everyone is too willing to believe the idiotic opinions of the teenage girl Briony.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|Dave's great. Megadeth has been far more consistant than Metallica, even including Megadeth's experimental CD's......at least they are still metal. Good old school return for Megadeth, even if some of the riffs are a bit familiar. Dave really deserves more credit than he gets for influencing young bands. Even bands like Machinehead and Skinlab owe alot to the mighty Megadeth's early influences. Speaking of Skinlab, check out their new live CD as one reviewer mentioned....I heard some songs and it's probably the heaviest live recording ever made. I was blown away. SkinnedAlive is what it's called, so check it out
0679882820|2.0|I bought this book for my 18-month old.  The illustrations and colors are not too engaging to me, and my daughter is actually scared of the book! Perhaps the story is too packed with sound effects to be read aloud.  It actually sounds a bit annoying. The book is now tucked away in a closet somewhere.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Each CD is just a bit more original, and this one is amazing. If you like Mayer, check out the Austin band Vallejo, their Thicker Than Water CD is  a mix of Mayer and Los Lonely Boys.....really amazing CD.
B000296GVG|5.0|What's so Da*n difficult about releasing this on DVD in The US?  I know it doesn't have stuff blowing up in it, but come on.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|Mark my words, people will be playing the riffs of Jack White for generations to come.......Stripes CD's are perfectly written and produced, where Jack has proven to be a genious....the Lorreta Lynn CD he did was probably one of the most brilliant musical projects released in the last 30 years. With Icky Thump, song after song of great catchy riffs and big hooks are abundant. A true genious, and sure rock and roll hall of famer when the time comes. I'd also highly recomend the new Poi Dog Pondering '7' CD, almost a polar opposite of the Stripes, but somehow very similar in the enjoyment equation.
0321544080|3.0|This is an interesting book but most of the explanations involve more lighting equipment than I will ever have.  I'd like to see Joe write a sequel explaining pictures that were taken with only equipment that an average person would carry without an assistant or a truck.  That would be much more valuable to the amateur or advanced amateur photographer who doesn't have an unlimited budget or staff of assistants.  I got more information that I could apply from Scott Kelby's recent how-to books.
B00154GEFU|5.0|Asia is a great band, but let's be honest, most bands don't make great CD's in different generations from their heyday.....Wooah, Asia didn't get the memo on that. This CD is brilliant, all killer, no filler....vocals, keyboards, the 'big' airy sound that is Asia is all here! Buy immediately. Also check out the new Fozzy All That Remains Unloaded CD, another unexpected gem!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|\\"Once\\" is one of the best music related movies that I have seen in quite a while, A wonderful story about two stuggling singer songwriters who find a chance to pursue their dreams in Ireland, The film has a wonderful low budget, independent feel to it, and while it has no big name actors, The actors are really musicians, the performances are excellent, and the sometimes awkward chemistry between the characters makes for a wonderful story, and the music is beautiful, the soundtrack was one of my favorite CDs of 2007 and the song\\"Falling Slowly\\" easily one of the best songs of 2007.
B00006879E|2.0|A few good songs, but it gets stale quickly compared to the debut....one reviewer recomended the new Vallejo Thicker Than Water CD, and I checked it out....smoking, killer CD.....I recomend that highly over this CD
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Okay, so I'm a little slow getting around to this series.  After hearing the good reviews, I decided to purchase it.  The reviews were right.  I LOVE this show.  I recommend it to any Sci Fi fan.  The humor is priceless!  The drawback to watching this is now I am VERY disappointed there are no more episodes.  This is one of the best shows I've seen!  I can't understand why this was canceled!<br /><br />Don't forget the movie, which picks up after the end of the series [[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity (Widescreen Edition)]]
B000NVIGC0|4.0|This is the Wilco CD that I really though should have followed the debut.....it's moody, rather dark, somber, and has that down feeling about it. Wilco are like the Stones of the Gen X generation, and will probably not really be honored like they should be until far after the fact......like the new Poi Dog Pondering '7' CD demonstrates, some of these true artists are making better records now than they did 15 years ago.........check 'em both out, you won't be disapointed
B001437DMA|5.0|I have all of Joe's CDs, the first I heard was \\"Surfing\\", then \\"Crystal Planet\\", and loved them all but after a while the vibe started to get repetitive somewhat for me with his last couple releases.  Till now!   I listened to the new CD twice so far, and though a couple of the songs, including the chant song \\"I just wanna rock\\" were really not my favorites, I must admit they were still unique and interesting. This new CD to me is a bit different than what he has done before, and that is exactly what I was hoping for with this release. Seems that he is applying the \\"less is more\\" approach to several of the songs, which made them excellent and pleasant to listen to especially while cruising around. He seems to play     for the songs, and not just a bunch of notes to show off his amazing abilities that we already know he has anyway. I don't remember really hearing piano on much of his stuff before, and it works great here!.  I very much recommend this CD.
B000ROALE4|5.0|You know what you get with a Slayer CD........every CD of the band's career is worth the buy...and that's the highest compliment I feel a band can get.     If you dig Slayer, check out the new SkinnedAlive live cd from Skinlab...a brutal, intense live cd....
B0015AARJI|4.0|There's so many reviews of this controler I'm not sure what else I can add here.  This is the controler that all PS3 users shoulda had from the start(silly Sony...just pay up!) and I've really missed having rumble on my games both new and old. The rumble works great on games that are patched or designed with it in mind but don't expect every game you put in your PS3 to give you the fun force feedback.  Users of this who impored from Japan(where this has been out for months!) reported as much before the USA launch but for examples: games like \\"Rachet and Clank Future\\" and \\"Warhawk\\" are rumble ready!<br /><br />Compared with the orignal PS3 controler this one weigs abit more but it just makes it fell abit more study and less like a lightweight boomerang you can easy toss across the room like a feather!<br /><br />Overall a great adition to the PS3...and one that the system shoulda had from the start(but you know how stuborn sony can be...)
B000001FA4|5.0|I am absolutely amazed by the reviewers who state: \\"Promenade\\", \\"4th of July\\", \\"Indian Summer Sky\\" and, in particular, \\"Elvis Presley and America\\" are somehow weak or sub-par.  These are some of the best moments U2 has EVER created.  This is clearly a band in the begining stages of musical and emotional maturation and unabashedly unafarid to put it out there as such.    His 1st person observation in \\"Promenade\\" is nothing short of breath-taking, and the way \\"4th of July\\" creeps into my skin is almost frightening.    The only thing that \\"Indian...\\" and \\"Wire\\" share in common is tempo, and even that's not quite the same.  A little known fact: Bono made up the lyrics on the spot to \\"Elvis...\\", that's why it's so ethereal.  it still makes me cry when he and the band crescendo together towards the end, begging to be forgiven.      listen to these songs again and TRY TRY TRY to remove yourselves from the constraints of pop music and what is only heard on the radio.  allow yourself to feel and be moved by these gems, they are brilliant.
0307263118|5.0|the melody of this book is pure beauty; though the story of incestual love is deeply troubling. the effects of that love can be felt as they pierce through time, silently creating misery for all. though i can't shake the image when i read this book, it is still an excellent read for the images it does evoke and the aesthetic questions it does pose about adult teenage angst.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Nice continuation of the series.  Still disappointed they canceled the series.  Enjoyed the movie very much though.
038551123X|4.0|I have to admit I had never heard of this novel before I watched the TV series \\"Dexter\\".  I then got this to see how different the literary source was from what I'd seen on TV - and the answer was - not as different as I'd thought it might be.    I can see why this novel has attracted attention. It's a mystery novel that breaks the accepted boundaries of \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\".  I have to say though that I preferred the ending in the TV series to the book, but I'm happy to have read the book and it always bought a smile to my face when I recognised lines in the novel that had been lifted wholesale into the series.  This is a dark book, but for the mystery genre it's also a rather startling and original work.    [[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Dexter - The First Season]]
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This is a 100% man movie. I watched it 3 times in the theatre, once in IMAX, and now I have it in Blue Ray. The picture is amazing, as is the sound. I did not buy it for the in depth plot, just pure action from beginning to end.
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|This movie was so enjoyable!  We watched it together as a family and all enjoyed it.  It wasn't the deeply moving experience that NEMO was for me, but it is great entertainment with \\"meat\\". My boys (ages 3 and 5) loved the animation, the music, and some of the humor.  Thankfully, there was a lot of quintessential Jerry Seinfeld humor for us, as well as great stuff for the kids.  Yeah, it's far-fetched, but aren't most animated movies? It's got a good message,too - several of them.  It's real message is about the balance of nature and how our actions truly affect the whole of creation/nature.  It's also about finding your passion and pursuing it.  And lastly, it's about how sometimes you find true friends in the most unlikely places!  ENJOY!
0307263118|2.0|I have read several books by John Banville, and this one I think could have benefited heavily from some editing. The author seems to enjoy creating prose more than conveying any particular ideas or creating characters. This book seems like a scetch that leaves you with the impression that you almost see a picture, but when you stop to think about it it's just a few rough lines on a page torn out of a notebook.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I teach biology and earth science to 9th and 10th grade kids who are \\"at risk\\" for a lot of things, perhaps the least of which is never graduating from high school.<br /><br />I brought Planet Earth into my classroom at the beginning of this school year.  Every other Tuesday, my classes and I have watched 45 minutes of this incredible journey.  We began with Disc 1 and progressed through all of them.  We never got to finish any of them in one sitting but it didn't matter.  We just picked up where we left off the next time we Movie Tuesday came around.<br /><br />Perhaps not so surprisingly, I had no absences on Movie Tuesday after the first few showings--well, until recently when we ran out of Planet Earth discs.  Every single more-hardcase-than-thou student was present on the days we turned off the lights, turned on the TV and got incredibly detailed knowledge into the animals, biomes, plants and intricate biological interrelationships shown so clearly in these remarkable DVD's.<br /><br />It's been a great teaching tool for me.  The discussions the individual movies have spawned in my classroom have been of great worth.  These are kids who, mostly, haven't ever even been to a real zoo.  Now a few of them have dreams of becoming wildlife photographers or videographers, occupations they didn't know existed before watching this series.<br /><br />The cost of this movie to me was worth it ten times over, and not only because it motivated a few of my bada*s students (so they think) into dreaming about and beginning to plan for a life outside and away from the guns, drugs and violence they go home to everyday.
B000ASDFJU|2.0|Bought this as a Christmas present for my fiancee.  Upon finally completing the set, she noted that about 30% of the discs do not play everything on the discs, with some discs refusing to play at all.  At first, I thought it was because the DVD player she has is older, but after trying the discs in three others, none of them play correctly.  The discs themselves don't look to be scratched, but they don't play nonetheless.  HBO should replace all defective discs, instead of taking the \\"we haven't noted any problems\\" stance, refusing to exchange discs.
B00104QSOM|5.0|I'm a huge P.T. Anderson fan and, of course, was very excited when -- years after \\"Punch-Drunk Love\\" -- he reappeared with a new movie: \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" a two-and-a-half hour epic about oil prospectors at the turn of the century. I saw it the day it opened.    On my first viewing, though, I didn't know what I thought. I respected the film. I thought Day-Lewis was amazing. I knew it was a daring, challenging effort. But I didn't know if I actually liked it, especially that crazy ending. The whole thing seemed to contain very little of the P.T.A. that I liked so much.     I was so perplexed I went back and saw it again. And that's when it really affected me. That's when certain sequences -- an oil fire, a speech about schools and bread, even just the sight of a drifting cloud shading a desert camp, a dab of oil on a baby's forehead or the shapes of oil wells sprung up on the horizon -- became profoundly, inescapably moving.     This is a movie so rich and deliberate and limestone-dense that knowing what will happen in the end actually sharpens its impact. It's in a second viewing that one can fully appreciate the characterization Daniel Day-Lewis brings to the role of Plainview.     But other elements are just as strong or very nearly -- young Dillon Freasier, who had not acted before, is astonishingly potent as Plainview's mostly silent son; Kevin J. O'Connor uncannily mirrors and converses Day-Lewis' characterization; Ciaran Hinds does a lot with very little as Fletcher Hamilton, Plainview's tough but watchful and subtly tender right-hand-man. And much was written about the abrasive edges of Jonny Greenwood's string-heavy score, but it's impossible to listen to a piece like, for example, \\"Prospector Arrives\\" and not be moved; he's created a rarity of a score -- music that's absolutely inseparable from the film, and almost seems to have been created simultaneously with the direction.     The movie's biggest talent, however, is Anderson. Many directors have lately tried to channel Terrence Malick (for example \\"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\\" which is a beautiful, haunting movie -- but really not much more than a gorgeous ode to \\"Days of Heaven\\"). Anderson does evoke Malick, but he incorporates enough of his own style and voice that the film transcends imitation and becomes something else entirely -- possibly something greater even than Malick's own films.     ---    The double-disk DVD is taking flack for not offering a wealth of material. But I think it's a fine, handsomely presented package. I think the extra disk offers just enough background on the film without giving away everything.     A slideshow and through a 1923 documentary, \\"The Story of Petroleum,\\" offers many of the sources and much of the inspiration behind much of the movie, beyond what was drawn from Upton Sinclair's novel, \\"Oil!\\"      A fine deleted scene, \\"Fishing,\\" shows us that -- contrary to what Plainview tells a crowd early in the film -- he occasionally DOES lose his tools down the hole and has to spend weeks fishing for them. The scene is great to see -- and sheds a lot of light on the relationship between Daniel and Eli's father -- but it would've interrupted the flow of the final narrative, and I'm glad it wasn't in the final cut.    I'm also glad there's no alternate audio track. Yes, P.T.A. gives some of the most interesting commentary around, but I honestly appreciate that he's leaving hidden some of the mysteries hidden behind this strange and wonderful and beautiful film. It's not for everyone, I realize, but I think it's the best movie of this year and last year and possibly the year before that. It just took me a second viewing to figure that out.
1582701709|1.0|Positive thinking is good, yes.  The universe, however, does not react to our thoughts.  Wishes don't come true by wishing hard enough.  There's really nothing left to say about it.

B000035P5E|4.0|The Film: Ken Follett's WWII espionage thriller brought to the screen in 1981 by director Richard Marquand.<br /><br />The basic plot: 'The Needle' is a Nazi spy in Britain, ruthlessly stabbing his enemies as he races to stay a half-step ahead of quite-competent MI5 C.I. agents. In 1944, he must get information and get back to Germany to expose the Patton-Calais deception. Weather and circumstances strand him on remote Storm Island, where he must meet a U-boat.<br /><br />Acting: Sutherland's icy, reptilian qualities (think Backdraft and Casanova) are perfectly suited to the spy character--he's brilliant. Kate Nelligan delivers a sturdy performance as a plucky resident of Storm Island.<br /><br />Nice editing; compact, well-paced plot with some interesting twists. Interesting role reversals, sexual metaphors, and atmospherics.<br /><br />Production values were high; the film has no cheap effects or CG; it stands up well and looks good on the DVD.<br /><br />Personal enjoyment: The Brits are portrayed as ever-polite but in their own way, even the old gaffers and other common folk are as ruthless as the spy, and all are passionate about helping 'do their bit.'<br /><br />If you like WWII movies, spy thrillers, Sutherland, or ken Follett novels, by all means buy this little gem.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|This is one of the first series that has kept me waiting for next week in years. I was captivated by the understated tension Bryan is able to show so realistically. Good people are forced underground by devastating illness and of course medical expenses in this country, all the time. This forces you to look at it. Illegal substance production/abuse is never a black or white issue at the core, even though it's never the \\"right\\" choice, this shows us what happens when it seems like the \\"only\\" choice.     Keep up the good work!!
0790729644|5.0|The last western that can ever come to life on the silver screen. After it there will only be placebo westerns. The ultimate episode of the western wilderness just before it turned so sour that your blood would curdle in your veins and your brain would either calcify into a heartless stone or liquify into a tasteless brew. The solitary cowboy is the real judge and executioner, in one word that last fatal justice maker that represents the final fate of all crooked minds that meet with their destiny in front of the barrels of his guns just before he shoots them dead with no remission, no suspension, no parole, ever and never. Fatal lethal fateful fate of a big bang death of a few trashy men who thought their violence was god's law to all others. And God came down from his heaven in the shape of Clint Eastwood and he struck them dead with the flashes of lightning of his anger. Just before these hooligans learned that women had to be respected, that plain justice, fairness and humanity require strength, righteousness and forwardness. With only one star in sight guiding their steps, the star that leads to Bethlehem and the birth of a really humane world founded on the salvation of the innocent and the damnation  of the guilty, and not the reverse. Probably the acme of western films, the final touch to be able to close a long line of inspiration that has to come to its end since the audience has now lost their innocence. When justified violence is the angry redeeming tool of gratuitous and pleasurable cruelty. But that's also the end of a myth, the myth that there is a salvation of the innocent and the weak in this savage world that could not even think of existing if it were not brutal.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne,  University Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

B000FC130E|5.0|I first became acquainted with Neil Gaiman by reading \\"Neverwhere\\". This is fantastic fantasy adventure. I could not put the book down. Anticipation and suspense keeps the reader deeply involved with character and eerie landscapes aptly painted by Gaiman. I've read several other Gaiman offerings, but, to date none approach the mastery of \\"Neverwhere\\".<br />\\"Neverwhere\\" is down to earth fantasy that will take you to unseen places and will hold you there until the very last word is read. Excellent !
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I agree with all the critiques so far, but the executives at PBS/Masterpiece Classics should be horsewhipped for being so stupid as to think that Austen lovers would be content with 1 1/2 hour productions and convoluted changes. This adaptation is delightful with it's music, costumes, and choice of actors- I think I've fallen in love with J.J. Feild, but at times I also felt like I was on a run-away train. The pace is so fast that I shouldn't be surprised that the last 2 minutes left me shaking my head-that was our hero and heroine walking out of Church with their baby, right?? Who could tell with such a long, awkward shot across the grass. The ending was not well done.   However, the adapters did try to capture the wit, irony, and tone of Austen's characters- not easy to make fun of Gothic novels when one is writing exactly that-a Gothic novel.
159102594X|5.0|I was simply blown away by Joe Abercrombie's novel \\"The Blade Itself\\". Basically the story is a 500 plus page preamble to his next two books. This is not a criticism of this book; rather it is a must in this series, as Abercrombie needs this time to flesh out a diverse and vastly three-dimensional group of characters. Publishers Weekly points out that none of the characters are \\"likable\\", but I would contend that what makes them likable is Abercrombie's literary insistence that each character wear a secret face...or many secret faces, just like real people. Glokta a former soldier and world class fencer is a torturer hideously crippled by his own experience with torture.  Logen Ninefingers (also known as the \\"bloody nine\\") is a battle scarred (both inside and out) warrior from the barbaric north. Jezal a snobbish young nobleman who wins the cities fencing title, Bayaz the first Magi and Ferro Maljinn a former slave turned savage by her experience. There are many more characters and all of them it seems hold secrets.     The story takes place in a time when the south's power structures and political elite are threatened by a new regime from the North and an influx of vicious humanoid creatures nicknamed \\"Flatheads\\". Abercrombie pulls no punches with his descriptions of torture, warfare and hand-to-hand combat, nor does temper the language. This is not \\"The Hobbit\\" written by a grandfatherly old scribe, but a Matthew Stover-esque type of language that reflects the streets and the hard times that the characters find themselves in.     \\"The Blade Itself\\" is a great read for anyone interested in realistic, gritty fantasy. I have just purchased the next two books in the series and look forward with great relish to tucking into them.
0385720920|5.0|Theres nothing I can say that has not already been said but I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed this book.It was very entertaining from the beginning to end! I cant say I recommend it to anyone because everyone has completely different opinions and some people may see this book as sick but I really enjoyed it and it was worth the $14 and change I spent on it and I will continue to read everything else written by this author.Its unique and unlike anything I have ever read before.I think I will hang on to it and read it again and again.This is one that I just cant trade in at the bookstore.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I was late to the HD-DVD band wagon. In fact I didn't buy it until the price of the 360 add on was lowered to $50. Anyways, this is the reason I bought it. I wanted this in high definition, but did not feel like shelling out the hundreds a Blu-Ray player costs. It was well worth it at the end of the day. This looks crystal clear in high-def at 1280x1024 widescreen on my 22\\" monitor. Discovery channel also had their own version, but this is the better one. No one beats David Attenborough in narration.     In all it's 11 episodes, about an hour each. The first a brief overview of the entire globe, the following 10 going in depth on particular climates/areas of the globe. It is disappointing HD-DVD died so suddenly. But if you have no immediate plans for Blu-Ray. Planet Earth is well worth keeping the player around. The one issue I take is with the case the discs are held in. It can be extremely difficult to get the disc out.  Otherwise, this is well worth the asking price.
B000006SGT|5.0|This collection contains all of the recordings The Animals made with Alan Price on keyboards and is the essential Animals collection.  The Animals of these recordings were the premier British blues band of all time.  No other British band, and very few American bands, could touch them when it came to the blues.  Their renditions of songs by John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles, and other greats stand with the originals.  Eric Burdon's vocals, Hilton Valentine's guitar, Chas Chandler's bass, John Steele's drums, and especially the keyboards of Alan Price came togerther in Newcastle-On-Tyne and exploded on to the world stage.  There are several Animals collections available but in my opinion, if you have this you really don't need any other.

B00104QSOM|2.0|Hmmm There will be blood wasn't that taken from Saw 2? I personaly found this movie boring.I found myself reading Stephen King Duma Key hoping to be distracted but found myself reading more and more.Folks is this the best Hollywood has to offer.Ya know if its not a movie about Oil and Politics then they don't want to hear about it.Although Daniel Day Lewis was good maybe a little mummbly{you would think his speaking would improve over the years,Quick call his dialogue coach} but it hasn't.I wondered to myself if Brad Pit's character in Snatch and Daniels character here had a face off it would be garbled like they were ubder water.This thing STUNK!
B00154GEFU|2.0|I have to admit that I bought this Phoenix despite hearing the track samplings on Amazon. The musicianship is just as you would expect. Anytime Carl Palmer is on his drum kit, I am blown away. One review says that he is too much in the background. That's where drums and bass usually are since they are the rhythm section. Still Palmer sounds just as fast as he ever has and no one else would have displayed his genious in the \\"background.\\" Howe sounds as good as ever, especially when he picks up his acoustic guitar. Downes displays his excellent keyboards throughout Phoenix and Wetton sounds as good as ever. So why just two stars?     Simply said, the songs are BORING. The first listen was way worse than I expected eventhough after listening to the samples, I did not think that I was purchasing classics like Sole Survior. The second listen was definitely better, because I didn't listen to the songs as much as I concentrated on the music. I am 49 years old and I am supposed to like this slower stuff and I might would have but good hooks are a minority on this CD. Now if these guys remade Silent Nation, it would blow you away.     Anyway, I will put four or five of these songs on my iPod and file the disc away. I have always been a huge Asia fan eventhough I was never a huge fan of John Payne's voice when compared to Wetton. However, John Payne and Geoffrey Downes kept the melodies coming. Phoenix ends up sounding more like a bedtime listen than a drive home listen. It is too bad, because Carl, Steve, John and Geoffrey show that they can still play with the best of 'em.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This is a great romantic drama, with some comedy, set in 1903 where a playwrite is trying to write a successful play.  He comes upon a family with a mother and four boys who have been through some trying times and, through their daily interactions, he begins to write the greatest play of his life - Peter Pan - based on the activities of the boys.  His main obstacle in the process is to bring young Peter (Freddie Highmore) from an adult's life back to a kid's life and convince him that he can use his imagination and have fun again.  This movie does what a movie should do - it gets you wrapped up in the lives of the caracters and puts you right in the middle of the story line.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
6305014140|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Great fight scenes.  Loads of bloody action.  Never dull.<br />*Strong, memorable imagery.  Excellent art design and details.  The characters look smashing.<br />*Intruiging, straightforward storyline.<br />*Characters are awesome.  They are very well-developed, very deep, and very immersive.<br />*The bad guys are awesome too.  They have a lot of interesting powers/traits.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Very shocking (at least for the first viewing).  The violence is extreme (on the same level as \\"Kill Bill\\"), and there are a few graphic sex scenes.  Definately not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Definately one of the best ninja/samurai films ever made (in anime or otherwise).  It is a simple story that leaves lots of room for some very deep characters and a lot of awesome fight scenes.  The extreme violence and sex may drive some people away, but for those who can stand it, it is quite awesome.<br /><br />The 10th anniversary edition includes one 30 minute interview session and some information to read.  It is in both fullscreen and widescreen (although I think somebody said that the widescreen side is a \\"fake\\" widescreen, with the top and bottom of the frame cut off).  Still, the video and sound quality on this disc is excellent.  Earlier editions of this film don't appear to have any features.

B00005MAM2|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Loads of fantastic action.<br />*Fair (but notable) amounts of bloody violence.<br />*Despite the age, the animation quality is good.  Backgrounds are extremely detailed and artistic.  Video remastery has made the colors very vivid.<br />*Art design is great.  Even though the characters look a little weird, they are memorable.  Above all, the city stands out and the bikes are cool.<br />*Interesting story.  It's actually very thick with politics and far-out ideas, and may come across as convoluted at first.  It's good, because it keeps you thinking (could be bad too, because it may be confusing).<br />*Some deep themes to think about (about society and humanity, for example).  Lots of fascinating ideas.<br />*Interesting cast of characters, which are fairly well-developed.<br />*Although die-hard fans may prefer the original 1988 dubbing, I believe that the new English dubbing on this disc is great.  The voices match the characters better (Kaneda no longer sounds like a sufer dude), it's not as goofy (the General no longer growls all the time), and some phrases sound better.<br />*Bizzare (but good) music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Even with the new English dubbing, some of the dialogue is goofy or corny.  Some of it is laughable (could also be a good thing, because it's fun and memorable).<br />*The two main characters like to scream at each other a lot (\\"Tetsuo!!!!!\\" \\"Kaneda!!!!!!!\\").  It's kind of funny.<br />*As noted above, plotline can be confusing.<br />*Storyline is shortened for the film format, and is therefore different from the manga (albiet the movie is a good adaptation anyway; both the comic and the film were made by the same man).<br /><br />It is easy to see why this film stands out as one of the most essential anime films ever made; it is to anime what \\"Star Wars\\" was to live-action movies.  It is loaded with innovative action scenes; most of them still blow me away.  It is fast, furious, and completely unrestricted.  Above all, it has exceptional quality in all respects (art, story-telling, music, sound, etc).  The story may be hard to follow in some spots, and the characters may not be as well-developed as in other films (like \\"The Ninja Scroll\\" or \\"Berserk\\").  Still, it is wildly entertaining and somewhat thought-provoking.  I highly reccomend this film to anybody who is even remotely interested in anime (and doesn't mind seeing some blood).<br /><br />It is English dubbed (the new 2001 dubbing, not the old 1988 dubbing), but I am sure that it also includes the original Japanese dubbing with English subtitles.<br /><br />Disc one includes a cool subtitles track that translates background graffitti.

B000Q6GUTI|3.0|Mark Wahlberg gives a good performance but the movie is kind of sloppily put together. The story line is weak. All actors apart from Mark play their parts poorly. Much of the movie is quite not-believable.    I did like the (tiny) parts of the movie that had to do with judging distance, wind speed and projectile mechanics but the rest of the movie is too amateur. On the back of the DVD it says \\"Along the lines of the Bourne Supremacy\\" or something to that effect but this movie is like a poor cousin. Much like what the 'Go-Bots' were to the 'Transformers' - if you know what I mean. Avoid unless you're getting this for free.
B00005MNP8|5.0|This is the shining crown in Blondie's very impressive collection of recordings.  From start to finish, this album is a thrill ride and it rightfully cemented Blondie as the Kings and Queen of the New Wave.  There are so many hits it's practically a greatest hits collection in of itself - Sunday Girl, Heart of Glass, Picture This, Hanging On the Telephone and of course One Way Or Another.  The songs that weren't singles on the album could have been!  This album taught the world was NYC downtown cool was all about.  Parallel Lines sounds as fresh today as it did in 1978.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B00011D1RC|5.0|Grand Hotel is a classic whose genuine glamour, artistic refinement and admirable good taste are  still motive of discussion and admiration all over the world.<br /><br />The agile camerawork, the perfect illumination, superb edition, level performances and rhythm are easily carved in relief since the first shot.<br /><br />Greta Garbo in her role of the Russian dancer would seem to have anticipated her own signature for the posterity with that emblematic statement \\"I want to be alone\\" . On the other hand we may watch a raising promise of the acting as Joan Crawford, besides the consecrated Lionel and John Barrymore.<br /><br />A film that exudes that inimitable touch of class that has permitted it to live into a fundamental region of our affective memory with almost genetic profile.<br /><br />Don't miss one of the most relevant Academy Award films ever made.
B00127RAJY|5.0|WOW!  What an amazing work out.<br />I am definitely a self proclaimed fitness DVD addict - I just can't help myself!  As a result, my library is pretty extensive...<br /><br />But of all of them, this one is THE most effective and time efficient DVD out of all of them.  The other Biggest Loser DVDs are also great, but this one is just incredible!  I'm still not at level 3 yet, and I generally work out 3-4 times a week!<br /><br />I love the variety of the 3 levels - which gives you a choice of how hard you want to work... though all 3 are intense... which I can say even though I haven't even gotten to the last level yet!!  The exercises are simple to follow, and the time just flies by. No complicated motions here... just intense, incredibly effective motions.<br /><br />Great value for your money and time efficient - I highly recommend this workout.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|We enjoyed this as a wrap up to the last season of this show.  We are going to miss this show.  The Ark of Truth is not a movie caliber DVD and that is why it wasn't released in theaters (my opinion), but it is an awesome episode.  If you were as disappointed with the last episode of season 10 (good episode, but not for the end of the entire show) as we were, then you will feel better having seen the Ark of Truth.  If you haven't been following the series, this one will be lost on you.

B000K4WLXA|5.0|This is the sequel for Final Fantasy VII video game. It's made for fans so if you didn't play the game or don't know some of the game plot then you're probably gonna get confused and bored. You can catch up with the story with the Final Fantasy VII review included on the DVD.  Excellent for those who love CGI animation, this movie is extremelly well done even the reflects on the bike are great.  This edition includes a bit for everybody, it gets the movie and previews for new games for the Final Fantasy VII Saga. The pictures included are grate, they seem as actor pictures. Even the novel and the script covers for those who love read.  Enjoy!
B000EGF0QY|5.0|I read this book at the prompt of my English instructor after he read one of my own essays, he told me to read David Sedaris' books to get some tips and ideas.    The first book I picked up was this one after searching through the library for him.  I read the first story to my mother, who even though she is rather homophobic found it hilarious.   The book was so funny that it made me literally laugh out loud (which can draw strange looks if you are in a restaurant).  It is one of my most favorite books. Ever!!

After what Chris Cornell put into these vocals it's a wonder that he was able to ever speak again -- let alone record more albums.<br /><br />It's one of those special albums that come around all too rarely.

The band itself is incredible, but you really have to pay attention to the dynamics that are ever changing in each Foo CD to truly grasp what a genious he really is. Dave even branched out with the Probot metal CD that was very cool, kinda sounded like Skinlab. Speaking of Skinlab, their new SkinnedAlive CD is incredible as well........and they also grasp the role of dynamics in a song.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Yes, it's Amazon, but there is a reason I use Amazon. I've used it a few times which has been every single time I needed to order something online. I love it so much because they are efficient and so easy to use. My mom uses it and she doesn't even know where to exit out of a window! My favorite part though is that they always deliver earlier than they say. They say it'll come in 5 days, it usually comes in 4 or eve 3 days. For this U2 CD, I lost my other on the way to a trip to Disneyland--long story. But I couldn't find it anywhere, so I gave up. Fat chance getting me somewhere to buy it, so why no online? I only trusted Amazon and it came in 4 days. Pretty soon my craving was satisfied! Thanks again!
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I think that I am Legend is a very good action packed movie. It has a lot of parts were you do at least one of the following, jolt, jump or stop breathing. It's very funny at times and other parts it saddens your heart. If you're like me you'll like this movie. \\"Why\\" you ask, because it doesn't scare you to death, gets you to laugh and you figure out things could be more heartbreaking in your life. I would pay to watch this movie one hundred times and then pay to see it again. It's just that good. I wouldn't take a young child or someone who has nightmares at night to see this movie. If you like being scared and watching people die and go through tough times this movie is for you.   A scientist, Robert Neville (Will Smith) is living with his trusty dog Sam in the new and deserted jungle New York. There was an epidemic and everyone who had \\"Clear eyes\\" or \\"Good eyes\\" was sent out of New York. Neville's wife and daughter were killed in a helicopter on their way out of New York. Sadly almost nobody made it through the travel. In New York Robert Neville lives an everyday life. He goes to the movie shop and gets and returns movies, he lives in his house, eats food and works out. He also hunts the prey running around, like the gazelle. A thing that isn't an ordinary thing that he does is he captures these sick humans that have turned into mutant creatures. He does this so he can try to find a cure for them. The way he captures them is by spilling blood onto a blanket and sets up a trap. He uses blood because the creatures are attracted to blood. He knocks them out cold and then takes the creatures to his house, into his basement and ties them down onto a stretcher. He gives a vaccine of some sort. Then they go wild.   Many creatures have died while Dr. Neville tries to find a cure. As the Robert was driving around one day he sees his friend from the movie store \\"Fred\\", the manikin. Neville walks towards the manikin. He thinks the manikin is one of the mutant creature so he shoots at him with his gun. The manikin just shatters. As he gets closer he is swung up in the air by a rope and the taxi car near the side of the rode drops off the side of the road. It was a trap. He's knocked out and his dog Sam is barking at him. As it gets closer to dark he awakens and sees the creatures there inside the building about 10-15 yards away.   He cuts the rope holding him up but stabs himself on the way down. The creatures have mutant dogs that are waiting for the sun to be blocked. They have to wait because the sun kills them and that's why they live in dark places. Sam protects her owner but she is badly wounded. Neville tries to kill himself but is saved by a woman named Anna and a boy named Ethan. The next morning when he woke up the place he stab himself was stitched up. The next night the manikins followed the scent of his blood and a whole army of manikins come towards the house. Will blows up part of them and saves Ethan and Anna. They head down towards the basement to hide. Mutant Creatures soon appear and.......   You'll have to watch the movie to find out what happens!
B000H6SXMY|4.0|This item is of an excellent quality.The booklet is lively, colourful and indispensable to find the episode titles.  The only drawback I see is the fact that the 10 seasons are dispatched into only 6 'book-boxes' so you need the booklet to find one particular episode.  I have no regret anyway.I am spending great moments watching the episodes from the first one to the end.

0452289963|3.0|Nothing sells a book quite like informing the reader:    \\"Not everyone is ready yet, but many are, and with each person who awakens, the momentum in the collective consciousness grows, and it becomes easier for others. If you don't know what awakening means, read on. Only by awakening can you know the true meaning of the word.\\"    Heck, now I am all worried I may not be ready...and maybe everyone else is...and maybe I'll get left out! Oh no!     Oh well, nothing new here...repackaged Eastern thought for Western seekers. Reading a book about Buddhism will give you the same outline about \\"ego\\" without the drone of Eckhart Tolle going on for pages and pages, restating the same thing over and over and over again. In all fairness, I have not finished this book because it is more painful than stabbing myself in the eye with a pencil. But I can see how others, who may be just getting into reading about different types of spiritual thought may get hooked into it if they have not already read other spiritual or comparative religion books. And besides if Oprah says it's good, sheesh, it must be...in a sort of mass consumer way.

I haven't read the book, so I can't compare the two, but the movie is a wonderful and very poignant love story with great performances by Gerard Butler and Hilary Swank, as well as lots of lovable supporting characters. I thought it was very easy to sympathize with Swank in her grief. It is incredibly sad, though, and I cried almost from start to finish, so bring the tissues!

He was also a good friend of Booker T. Washington and Frederick Douglass, and helped inspire them in their own efforts to help America, a country then (as it is now) full of broken souls.<br /><br />Words fail me.

1400064287|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but felt like the authors' core ideas had been covered or predictable by the time I got to page 120 or so.  No doubt, there are compelling things in here.  However, I felt that the Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible Emotional Stories theme is something that could have been handled well in the context of a 25- to 30-page article.<br /><br />For my money, a better option is Cliff Atkinson's [[ASIN:0735623872 Beyond Bullet Points: Using Microsoft® Office PowerPoint® 2007 to Create Presentations That Inform, Motivate, and Inspire]].  Yes, I know what you're thinking...a book about PowerPoint is your preferred option?  No.  It's a book about storytelling.
B00154GEFU|4.0|with this album Asia continues to explore their past, as they have done on the recent tours.  We have two 3 part compositions one of which (parallel worlds) would fit comfortably on a king crimson album.  We also get the finished (reworked) version of a song started during the first round (Jodie/Alibis) as well as an excellent cover song (Orchard of Mines).    The album is more mature than previous efforts but does suffer at times with a lack of punch.  This is mostly due to the slow pacing of some of the songs (or song parts).    Great songs:  Never Again  Orchard of Mines  An Extraordinary Life  Vortex/Deya    Good songs:  Heroine  Alibies  Shadow of a Doubt  Wish I Had Known    Overall I am quite happy with this album and think that it fits well in my collection.
B00005ASGG|5.0|There are bad films, good films and a few masterpieces. This is one of the few.   We see: Liberty, economy, democracy... good words, great ideals, but from time to time, until now, these principles must be defended with a gun, a Colt 45: an human limitation, but resigning is poor. Not in vain stock market has the terms \\"Bull or Bear market\\". For me this signifies behind richness and wealth, there are an animal, irrational but unavoidable shadow at less until now: in this superb film that animal are Liberty Valance, and he menaces democracy, but there was an ignored man who killed him.  Ramson Stoddart is a good, able lawyer, he wants people in the Far West can be able to read, schools, laws.  But there's no law excepting these of the revolver. Tom Doniphon doesn't know much about paper laws, but he's strong and speedy with his gun. He knows the beautiful Hallie doesn't love him, and feeling all that, he kills the psychopatic murderer who is Liberty Valance, the gunman at service of the big,  oppressive cattlemen, and with that fact, he brings liberty, democracy while he retires voluntarily to a lone, sad existence: no doubt, democracy has a price. Doniphon is a  tragic figure, perhaps he don't understand ver well what he has done and why, but he's essentially a good man who believes in justice.
1427201439|5.0|Finding any sci-fi series that rivals this one is difficult.  Possible contenders are Stranger in a Strange Land or some of the early Asimov sci-fi novels.  Herbert has a gift for description as well as philosophy, but I would not advise reading the book for its message or its symbolism (which does seem to be thrown at the reader like a wrecking ball at times).  The simple fact is that it is a good story and it is an entry into an entirely unique universe.  Every sci-fi or fantasy novel that has succeeded this book seems to borrow something from it.  Yet modern writers often concern themselves more with the advancement of technology, where as Herbert dealt more with the advancement of humans.    I do not wish to discredit those reviewers who gave this 1 or 2 stars.  This book is not for everyone.  It requires a great deal of patience at times.  It is also not likely that the reader will grasp every element of the story on the first read because of the overall density  of the material.  That being said, this one has the potential to become addictive.
B00007KWHG|4.0|Made this purchase after seeing the broadway hit play  \\"Jersey Boys\\", and have really enjoyed the old songs.
078401213X|2.0|This is a short story dragged out for 81 mins. Thats right 81 mins and this movie was too long. The black and white picture didn't work at all for me. I dont understand why in this particular movie that they would use black and white instead of just regular color. The black and white picture made it hard to see what was going on in the very few action moments of the film. The movie for the most part was boring. The acting for the most part was pretty good which is probably the biggest upside of them film. This is not a movie you should buy but one you should rent if you must watch it at all.    Pros: acting and premise, which in the long run didn't pay off.    Everything else hits the con margin making this a two star movie.
0312330871|5.0|Agatha Christie is one of, if not the worlds most popular mystery writer, many of today's mystery writers have credited her as their inspiration. And 'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE' (aka TEN LITTLE INDIANS) is hailed as one of her greatest works, so I decided if I wanted to read something by one of the masters of suspense this was as good a place to start as any!<br /><br />'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE' is a mystery in its barest form.  There are no high speed car chases, no violent shoot outs, no glitz, no glamour.  Just the story of ten strangers lured to an island by a madman who is killing them off one by one.  What is the twist you ask?  The madman is most certainly one of the ten and it is up to them all to try to figure out who it is before they all fall victim to his whims.<br /><br />I love to read old books and I am so glad to have chosen Agatha Christie's 'AND THEN THERE WERE NONE' as my first aquatience with this acclaimed author. While I had my theories as to who this madman was the book definitely kept me guessing until the very last passage, where I found out that who I thought was the killer was completely wrong!  This is a must read for any lover of mysteries and good books.
B00002ND77|5.0|It was great and it showed how Malcolm X evolved as a person.  I loved it.
0385121679|4.0|After having read Stephen King's 'THE STAND' I could not wait to get my hands on some of his other classic works.  Before reading 'THE STAND' I had never been a huge fan of King's, I'd read a few of his books here and there but never any of the ones considered to be classics.  So after reading 'THE STAND' I naturally decided to pick up 'THE SHINING' next.  Having seen the Stanley Kubrick movie many, many years ago I felt a sense of de ja vu when starting this book which, unfortunately caused me to get off to a very slow start but once I got through the first hundred and fifty or so pages I was hooked.<br /><br />The story of the haunted Overlook Hotel is enough to scare any reader, especially if you read this book late at night, which I often did!  But also the story of the Torrance family who the hotel's ghosts tore apart so handily is also heartbreaking and King deals with all of their thoughts and emotions very well here.  While I do admit that there were parts of this book that dragged, overall it was a great reading experience, King can be a master story teller when he is on and he was definitely on when writing 'THE SHINING'.  And if you are, like I was,  worried that seeing the movie will ruin the book for you, I can assure you that the similarities are few and far between and the ending is completely different!  So don't let that tiny detail deter you from reading this classic!
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I haven't had the chance to buy and review the new edition yet except for listening to individual songs on JamsBio.com, but I was reading through the reviews and couldn't resist commenting. I listened to Thriller originally on 8 track and frankly I thought the sound quality was excellent even then. From what I've heard so far and reviewed of the Thriller song list for the 25th Anniversary, I think this is a great deal.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I have watched Supernatural from the first day it aired. It is truly a great show with great characters. The entire staff does an amazing job to bring fans (and newbies to the show) the best TV out there right now. It has a great blend of humor, horror, pathos, and family that really stands out, making this TV show truly shine.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|I love this album, it's snarky, confident and narcissistic. This is a totally change in direction from the dreadful releases she made in the past, I actually like this, it has attitude.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I got this DVD a few days ago and did it yesterday for the first time.  I absolutely LOVE IT.  I'm sore today.  Each workout is only 20 minutes long which I love.  The music is decent (music is a big deal to me for motivational purposes), she gives great direction, and she is motivating.  I'm excited to see the changes in my body.  And we all know she knows what the heck she is doing based off of her amazing success on Biggest Loser.    This DVD is highly recommended.  Especially for the busy person like myself :)
B000127LW2|4.0|Star Trek: Voyager, Season One is so-so. It has its good spots and has its bad spots. Like other reviews have already stated, it struggles with its consistency in some places, much like Star Trek: The Next Generation did in its first season. Good series overall though.    I probably would have given this 3 stars, but it appears the price has FINALLY been lowered, down to a level comparable to the other Star Trek series, and that itself makes it worthwhile.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Thank you Jillian!  I just did my first 20 minutes workout - level 1 of 3 level options - and I don't know if I can carry myself upstairs to bed!  Ha!  I'm even having trouble lifting my arms enough to type on the keyboard.  This is a dynamic, kick your butt into gear, workout and I KNOW I'm going to get results in no time with this DVD.  I just got back on a fitness kick late last fall after YEARS of getting fat and flabby.  I have been using a \\"Firm\\" Stability ball workout - which is great - but I wanted to try something different and I am so glad I picked Thirty Day Shred.<br /><br />First, I love the fact that there are three separate levels to this workout system.  I can start with level one and move on to two and then three when I'm ready.  They don't try to jam three levels into one workout.  Jillian gives you plenty of instruction along the way to make sure you are doing the exercises correctly.  Yea - a lot of the stuff is old school, but that's part of the reason it's easy to follow, no complicated dance movements here.  I'm not training for Broadway, after all.<br /><br />I also love the fact I can get a dynamic workout in just 20 minutes a day.  I don't have a lot of time in my day and it's going to be so much easier to motivate myself to put the DVD in and move my butt when I know it's only 20 minutes. The intensity packed into that 20 minutes had me begging for mercy after 10 minutes! I'm going to be crying in pain tomorrow, but I'll be back at this workout tomorrow night because I know it's working.

B0001GL3K4|5.0|This winning film starts out with the premise that, contrary to popular belief, the world is full of love, not hatred. By watching the lives of 8 different pairs of people in London, England, some of the many different types of love are explored. There's platonic, seen in the relationship of an aging rock star and his manager, and puppy love, as a young boy develops a crush on a classmate. There's unrequited, when Mark's best friend marries the woman he wants for himself, and the specter of infidelity, when a husband's eye is caught by his secretary. Throw in a couple of cases of loving from a distance, and a junket to Milwaukee to hook up with some of those hot American girls, and there's all sorts of mistakes and magic going on. The finale, though relying heavily on coincidence, is fascinating as all the main characters are brought together at a school Christmas pageant. No deep philosophy here, just good, engaging entertainment provided by a stellar cast and witty director/writer. A bit too racy for children.
0307387178|5.0|Krakauer did an excellent job on this book. It really takes you into the mind of McCandless about as well as any writer can do trying to piece together McCandless's journey. I read the piece in National Geographic Adventure and watched the movie before reading the book. I found in all cases that the writers and filmmakers were genuinely respectful of what Chris and his family went through.     Regardless of what your opinion may be of Chris's \\"foolishness\\", I came away believing that Chris was running away from a confusing childhood but was essentially an optimist and had no intention of never coming back. Sometimes the journey to finding one's self can be difficult and lonely (even on those around us), but I think McCandless was trying to find himself and in doing so would have eventually restored his faith in his family and humanity. Unfortunately, he did not get the opportunity.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|Watching this dvd was like deja vu for me.  Some of the houses I've lived in had some of these problems and we discovered them in much the same way the main characters do. I think Tom Hanks and Shelley Long were very believable.  This dvd is very entertaining and \\"scary\\".
0060594888|4.0|I believe this book can be very useful for anyone who want's to be successful in life, if you consistently practice the principles relayed within. However, it's true that (as one disillusioned reviewer stated) this book will not change your life. No book has the power to change your life, since a book is an inanimate object. But this book does have valuable information that can be used to expand one's awareness as to what works (and what doesn't) to get one what he or she wants in life.The only way a person can change his or life is through \\"decisions\\". And making the decision to read this book and actually apply the principles consistently can have a big impact on one's success in life. My main criticism of this book is that it does not provide one with a good \\"decision-making model\\" (or any decision-making model), as \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" (by Anthony Robbins) does. And since your destiny in life and the quality of your life is determined entirely by your decisions (other than things over which you have no control), a good decision-making model is imperative for any book that attempts to provide all that you need to know about how to become really successful and get what you want in life.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|For Stargate fans this is a good DVD. It did provide a venue for expanding on the TV series in a movie format yet continuing on with the concluding story line to an open ended ending. For Science Fiction, excellent DVDs are limited. This is one of those excellent ones. I hope more will follow.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I downloaded all 14 eps onto my Xbox360. After the first ep I was hooked! It was something fresh, and had a different feel.. Whatever it was, kept me coming back for more. I normally do not watch anything from TV. I have no cable. Only Internet. It was a step of faith so to say as far as spending money and downloading the first ep. But it was well worth it!<br /><br />I was extremely disappointed when I found out that, the series had been cut off short. Whoever made that decision wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed.<br /><br />Anyways, I guess we can only hope, that sites like amazon with there rating system, show how valued this series is. Maybe it will get picked back up?
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater 11 times; more than any other movie. In 1967 this movie totally captivated me. I even fell in love with the little Indian girl at the end of the film. And after purchasing this DVD, I'm still crazy about it 40 years later. Some of the catchiest tunes ever, and way ahead-of-its-time animation. Everyone in the family will love this Kipling and Disney classic.
0452289963|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that I am reading it again for the second time. Everything in this book resonated with me so much that it seems like I am regaining consciousness. It is simply an amazing book. I will be getting more of Eckhart Tolle's books in the near future.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I remember the excitement of this film's release. It had been years since Disney had given us anything of note from their animation department. Based on the Hans Christian Anderson classic, \\"The Little Mermaid\\" brought large audiences back to the type of Disney tradition millions had grown-up on.     With characters like Sebastian the crab, the evil witch Ursula, king Triton and Prince Eric, great Disney family storytelling was back on track. But Ariel \\"the Little Mermaid\\" with voice beautifully provided by Jodi Benson, truly is the star of this warmly touching cinematic delight. You truly feel for her, and her deep longing to become human. Such a lovable tale for all ages, which can even be a little frightening for very small children; especially towards the end when evil Ursula seems to have conquered all of the sea kingdom and everyone of its inhabitants. But most will be pleased with the extremely happy ending. Outstanding Howard Ashman and Alan Menken score.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Eddie Vedder can do no wrong.  His songwriting is pure genious.  I love Pearl Jam and had to buy this.  However this CD is unique, Eddie uses his own personality to create a whole body of songs that are genuine to the movie. I was pleasantly surprised at Eddie's solo work.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|To keep it short, this is an awesome album.  I find it very relaxing to listen to pretty much any time of day, especially after listening to death metal (which is my favorite).  I also like very much that Vampire Weekend uses many African beats.  Its different, and they use them very tastefully.
0375703764|5.0|Mark Z. Danielewski's \\"The House of Leaves\\" is certainly a rare find. It maintains to be funny, sexy, scary, amusing, and beautiful at the same time. A nice blend of Poltergeist, The Amityville Horror, The Blair Witch Project, and The Ring, with a style similar to famous authors Stephen King and Dean Koontz, it is, in itself, \\"a poetic labyrinth\\" with a story structure that is between an expository text/film review/journal/novel
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Now a lot of people didnt like this movie for 1 reason...shaky cam. I think thats unfair to judge it by that alone.It didnt bother me but I know it bothered a LOT of people and if you cant handle shaky cam thats ok , no big deal , but this movie is all shack cam throughout. But anyways this movie really is scary , a lot of mystery and suspence, Very cool to see a good monster movie. Very different movie than most out there...but thats a great thing.The only problem is that its too short.If you like scary movies with lots of suspence and mystery you should really enjoy this. I know I did.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I have never been this depressed in my entire life. Who wrote these lyrics, Hillary Clinton????<br /><br />\\"I'm drinking a soy latte, I get a double shot-tay, it goes right through my body and you know I'm satisfied\\"- It's worth it just to hear this line.<br /><br />\\"I'd like to express my own point of view, I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew\\"- Yeah, we pretty much figured that out, M.<br /><br />\\"Push the button, don't push the button\\"- Make up your damn mind, Madonna!<br /><br />\\"I'm not myself when you go quiet, I'm not myself alone at night\\"- (Don't ask)<br /><br />Yeah, don't blame her awful rapping attempt for this trainwreck. There isn't one good song on this at all. I actually got laughed at for trying to do the song \\"American Life\\" at Karaoke.<br /><br />I've tried so many times to like this CD. Really. If it hadn't been for \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\", her career would have been a complete and utter trainwreck. All the songs are contrived to the point where they sound exactly the same.<br /><br />Yup, this stinks pretty bad.
0783225857|5.0|There are not too many film versions of novels which \\"match-up\\" to the original in print. This one does a particularly excellent job. It \\"fleshed out\\" the characters of Atticus, Scout, Gem and others for me and it did, to me, portray the main storyline: the picture of a father's relations with his children, the community at large as well as contemporary societal issues.

B00001MXXH|5.0|FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF gave us numerable cinematic moments--all of them timeless.  The \\"Twist & Shout\\" celebration in downtown Chi-Town.  The Ferrari crashing through a plate glass garage.  Matthew Broderick's impish deadpan to the camera.  Ben Stein's monotone chant, \\"Bueller. . .Bueller. . .Bueller. . .\\"  All of the above (and more) made for one grand time when this film came out in 1986; all of the above continues to treat viewers to one grand time today.<br /><br />Writer/director John Hughes makes truancy downright charming as we enjoy the antics of laid-back Ferris Bueller (Broderick) and two of his buds cutting class on a delightful spring day.  Having suckered his parents (and the entire city of Chicago, for that matter) into believing he is sick, Ferris makes the best of his temporary freedom; he and his pals enjoy fine dining, a Cubs game, participate in a parade, go for a swim.  And all the while, Ferris is being pursued by his relentless, yet unlucky, principal (Jeffrey Jones is hilarious).  The administrator knows Ferris is playing hookey--he's just having one dickens of a time catching Bueller in the act.<br /><br />As humorous as this entire film is, it succeeds and flows and works because Broderick so aptly carries it.  Whether he's talking his best friend into \\"borrowing\\" the friend's father's sports car, or he's deadpanning to the camera any number of optimistic \\"Buellerisms,\\" Broderick is always charming, witty, and deliciously ornery.  Even after the closing credits have rolled, Broderick makes a hasty appearance to admonish his audience (\\"You're still here?  Go home!\\").  Broderick's been in several flicks, but here he's never been better; and next to \\"Caddyshack\\" FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF is the finest comedy the Eighties has to offer.<br />--D.

0618918248|2.0|This book aims to proof  that the Universe does not need God to be explained. The author is a renewed bio-scientist with many other previous publications on the subject. It is certainly interesting as an intellectual exercise, but it would be very naïve to think that such a book (or any other one aiming the same) could come to any definite conclusion about the existence or not of God! The best we can say would be perhaps \\"God is not necessary to explain the evolution of the Universe: for that all we need are the Laws of Physics\\". This is correct for sure! But someone could then ask the simple question: \\"Why are the Laws of Physics as they are? After all, if they were not as they are, there would be no Universe and we would not be here having this discussion. May be we need God to explain that!\\" This argument can go endlessly, with no conclusion.<br /><br />Proofing or disproving the existence of things is hard to do in Science, in general. In 1905, most of physicists were convinced of the existence of the aether. Did Einstein proof with his theory of Relativity that the aether does not exist? No! He proof that the idea of an aether was not necessary to explain some physical phenomena, and therefore could be discarded. Likewise, the idea of God may be unnecessary to explain physical phenomena, but physical phenomena cannot be used to proof or disproof the existence of God. We cannot use the Laws of Physics to proof why the Laws are as they are. We need something more fundamental, simply because we live upon the Laws of Physics (including our brains). It would be like using a watch to proof that time exists, or using a scale to proof that space exists!<br /><br />My particular view is that Science, as much as Arts and Religion, is only one aspect of human culture. From this point of view, science is not intrinsically better or worse than Religion or Arts and has no authority upon those branches of culture. We cannot use Science to proof or disproof an artist thesis, and so we cannot use Science to proof or disproof Religion thoughts. Many eminent scientists along History believed in God, including Einstein and Isaac Newton. And many other did not, like the author of the book. If Science could conduct to a definitive conclusion about the nonexistence of God, every scientist should be an atheist.

B000002J1S|1.0|This is widely regarded as a brilliant album from Genesis, but I never could figure out why. The only song I really like a lot is the title track. The album is overly lavish and artificially grandiose. The story makes no sense, the narrative is impossible to follow, and the music tries to be classical while remaining in a rock and roll realm. I'm not a huge fan of Peter Gabriel either; I prefer Phil Collins.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Finally! Whitney Houston decides to release an Ulitmate Collection of her greatest hit songs. I know she released her Greatest Hits package back in 2000, but we all know that was tragic. With all the remixes of her great songs. Now with this collection, it has all the original songs and all are remastered. Who can ever forget this woman, with her amazing voice. I've been there with her from the start with 1985's \\"You Give Good Love\\". Now the last 2 albums she has released \\"Just Whitney\\" and \\"One Wish\\", were not up to her standards. I am glad she did not include any tracks from those albums on this collection. The only flaw I have to this album is that it is missing a few Ultimate Hits, like \\"You Give Good Love\\" #3 hit,\\"All The Man I Need\\" #1 hit,\\"Miracle\\" #9 hit,\\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" #2 hit,\\"Love Will Save The Day\\" #9 hit,\\"My Name Is Not Susan\\" #20 hit,\\"I Believe In You & Me\\" #4 hit,\\"Step By Step\\" #15 hit,and \\"Count On Me\\" #8 hit. Besides those songs missing, this is an Ultimate collection by the one and only Whitney Houston. I recommend this album to you!
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|Not long ago I had just discovered a band called Lacuna Coil. This was really new music for me and I saw that Nightwish was listed as another artist I might like. I was able to sample some songs from this album and they happened to be NEMO and SIREN. When I heard SIREN I knew I had to have this album.  The album is quite good though I am not as into the over the top symphonic part of this music but that is part of what Nightwish is about. Since discovering this album I have also found some other artists who have a similar mix of metal and amazing female vocals.  The Gathering has an amazing mix of metal / electronic and sometimes ambient music. The vocals are amazing and albums like [[ASIN:B000CQO0WQ Mandylion]] and [[ASIN:B000UZ4E52 Nighttime Birds]] are really amazing. More recently their album [[ASIN:B000EQ5QA4 Home]] is more like Depeche Mode. Within Temption is a little more like Nightwish but perhaps a little more commercial (not that they are at all commercial really) and have that mix of metal and symphony but it is a bit more melodic. [[ASIN:B000TZ8Q9I Mother Earth]] and [[ASIN:B000ROALIU The Heart of Everything]]  really stand out as great albums. Two lesser known bands from the USA are worth a mention. Anti-M has released and album titled [[ASIN:B000UOFL1O Damage]]. The song RAGE has an eastern feel kind of like SIREN and a great mix of vocal melodies, hard rock and electronic rock. A bit of it even sounds like Rush. Collide's album [[ASIN:B000050YAK Chasing the Ghost]] is more electronic like HOME but is so melodic and mysterious.  I think if you like this symphonic / Electronic / Metal Genre you can't go wrong with any of these bands. ONCE is definately my favorite Nightwish, I have not yet heard the new album with the new vocalist.
B000002A46|5.0|Mariah Carey's classic Christmas album, released back in 1994. This is album has dated very well. It contains her Christmas classic \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\", I wait every year to hear it on the radio and very seldom I'll pop it into my stereo to hear it anytime. She has a great voice, and I am glad she decided to record this masterpiece back in 1994. The album debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 and has sold approx. 5 million copies in the U.S. alone and 16 million copies worldwide.Making it one of the best selling Christmas albums of all time. Other standout tracks include Joy To The World,Santa Clause Is Coming To Town,Silent Night,O Holy Night,and Jesus Born On This Day. Mariah Carey is a great artist, I have always enjoyed her music. Hopefully, she can make another Christmas album one of these days. Keep rockin Mariah!
B000IOM1Z0|5.0|This was the first Parsons album I ever owned. I was a Yes / Genesis fan at the time. The music here is a little bit pop a little bit progressive and a bit electronic. I have always enjoyed every song on this album but the instrumental THE GOLD BUG is a personal favorite.     It is nice to have the album remastered after all these years. The bonus material is subjective so I leave that for those who are into that kind of thing.     You can't go wrong with this album if you like Alan Parsons.
B000002LLC|2.0|When this was released back in 1990, I was a huge Madonna fan. She had just got through promoting her 1989 masterpiece \\"Like A Prayer\\" album and I was awaiting what she had in store for us now. I am truly disappointed in this album, the only reason for the purchase of this album is for the classic track \\"Vogue\\". Besides that, the album is total noise! The song \\"I'm Going Bananas\\" is odd, Madonna must have gone bananas to record that. I am still not sure to this date, why she released this album. The only other decent track on this album is \\"More\\", it's not a jaw dropping song but its decent. As for the other tracks they are not good at all. The song \\"Hanky Panky\\" is just plain bad. As I stated before, the only reason for the purchase of this album is \\"Vogue\\", and as of now, you can get that track on the \\"Immaculate Collection\\" album. Not a keeper!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I thought I was in good shape when I got this DVD. Jillian proved me wrong. The workouts are TOUGH. They cause most muscle groups to burn. Your lungs burn. Your shoulders and arms and legs will be sore. You will sweat. And it's awesome. I hear in the back of my head when I do this workout: \\"Hate me now, love me later.\\" I do hate her during the workout because she won't give me a break! Which is a good thing. But I love her now because I've only been doing this workout for a week and already lost an inch on my arms and can see a difference in tone everywhere.   Also, they have a funny feature where you can turn off Jillian's voice during each workout and just have the background music....are they saying you wouldn't want to listen to her while you work out? She is pretty intense, after all...
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|Britney Spears is a talented entertainer. But for the last 2 or 3 years. She has been more media attention than anything else. Her first two albums \\"Baby One More Time...\\" and \\"Oops I Did It Again\\" were catchy. Following that, things went wrong! I happened to borrow this album from a friend, to give a good listen. I gave it right back the next day. Every song sounds the same after every other. The only catchy track on this album is \\"Gimmie More\\". I believe she is a talent entertainer when it comes to her concerts, but as for making new music for albums. I can pretty much bet, that she will not make anymore catchy music. Hopefully her life does get back together of what it was before.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I was thoroughly impressed with X&Y by Coldplay, having spent my entire high school career writing off this band as too mellow for my taste. Wow, I cannot remember a CD that had me falling in love with every single track. The lyrics are beautiful, poetic, (and clean! surprise!), the music is incredible---it's good for yoga, by the way! For someone who used to bash Coldplay at any given moment, I now have \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" as the top-played song in my iTunes library. Worth the money!
0452289963|5.0|The author has the ability to communicate an essential aspect of contemplative experience to contemporary people.  You don't need a technical vocabulary, the aura of a distant historical period, an outfit from an exotic culture, or a preface by a Harvard scholar.  It's simple.  But it's real.  If you want to stay imprisoned in a nightmare,  read Ayn Rand.  If you think mysticism is about stupidity and nihilism, read Meister Eckhart, Plotinus, Richard of St. Victor, Hafiz, St. Teresa of Avila,the Baal Shem Tov, Jalal el-din Rumi, St. Bonaventure.  But if you just need to know the way out of the enchanted enclosure of the ego once in awhile, try this author.  Dare to feel thankful.
0979660742|5.0|This book has been around for so long, but always seems up to date. I just bought it for our college bound daughter, as our shelf copy is pretty old. Consider it required reading for everyone who wants to sharpen their writing skills.
B000OVLNII|5.0|This book was a page-turner.  There is not a false note or a deficient section or arrangement in it.  The author does an excellent job in telling Lincoln's story from cradle to grave, with the emphasis of course on his political years, but with enough background to inform and enlighten the discussion of the political years.  Even more amazing, the book weaves in substantial biographies of major figures like Seward, Bates, Chase, Stanton, and the Lincoln family.  This complex effort could have collapsed under its own weight, become plodding, or become confusing.  Nothing of the sort happens.  Instead, the pieces fit together very nicely and you feel yourself learning and sinking into the era as you make your way to the tragic ending.  The detailed research is impressive, as is Goodwin's ability to relay it in an engaging and clear style.  Abraham Lincoln came to life like never before.   I finished the book on April 15, the day he died, and found myself sad for his ending and grateful for the skill and dedication with which he led this country through a terrible trial.  I highly commend this book, and a visit to Springfield, to tour Lincoln's home and visit his tomb, to those wishing to learn about, and honor, a great man.
B001200K0C|5.0|The songs are great, but it really sounds dated. THe production has not held up and this thing desperately needs to be remastered and reissued.   I'd recomend you check out the new Fozzy All that Remains Reloaded cd as well!
1416914293|5.0|This book was as thrilling as the first one.  I can't wait for the third one to come out!!
B001200L3S|4.0|Awesome CD    Heavy, yet melodic......perfect combination and very unique at the time. I highly recomend the new Fozzy All That Remains Reloaded CD/DVD if you dig Skid.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|The perfect item for those who love movie scores and those who love LOTRs.  I've been dreaming of this exact set, and I've just bought all 3.  The music is gorgeous and in full clarity.  The DVD, although annoying due to its double-sidedness, is a great bonus.  My only quibble is that it doesn't have a stand-alone track for Annie Lenox's \\"Into the West\\" (it's somewhat buried and a bit muted in one of the last tracks).  Wonderful and worth the money!!!
B0013FDM7E|5.0|For this genre of movie, you wont find much better. I never felt anything was corny at any point in the film as i do when watching other scary movies. Will Smith is actually pretty funny in this movie at times: cracking jokes with his dog, and chatting with manikins... Its the kind of movie that makes you think 'what if this really happened?'. If you liked 28 days later, you will love this one. If you did not like 28 days later, you may want to pass.
B000NA2776|5.0|Most of the time when you come across music that's generally described as feel good, most of the time it's very self indulgent tripe, however, Mika has the magic touch with making you feel good with his music and you realise that he's not the typical musician that's full of his own compliments. Grace Kelly was the first time I'd ever heard anything of Mika's and to be honest without seeing the video or hearing any introduction of the song itself I actually first thought it was an old song by Freddy Mercury. Mika's vocals are very sound-a-like to Mercury, which I think is his whole appeal as some people would like to think that the sould of Freddy still lives on. Mika himself has credited Freddy as an inspiration for his music.<br /><br />We have a saying in the UK that it's Marmite music, you either love it or you hate it. I've met many people who purely hate Mika and his style of music, yet I've met people who can't get enough of his music. I'm a part of the latter group as I really can't get enough of his music. Mika truly has a bright future ahead of him as he's now given us a sound that is really his own, and the minute you hear a new song of his on the radio, before you're told who it is you know it's Mika.<br /><br />My Top 5 are<br /><br />Relax, Take It Easy<br />Lollipop<br />Grace Kelly<br />Big Girls, You Are Beautiful<br />Happy Ending.<br /><br />This is a really special album that I feel can lift anybody out of a bad mood and have them laughing and smiling again.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Holly Hunter will knock your socks off in her white dress.  You need to see Spencer Tracy in \\"A Guy Named Joe\\" to see where this movie originated.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|I am a fan of the Black Keys, I can't seem to move on to anything else.  Everytime I try something else, I am back to the Keys before long.  The Big Come Up grabbed me and sucked me in, no mediocre songs, a true 5 star album. I went through the other albums and though i have enjoyed them all Chulahoma is special.  The newest album Attack & Release is supposed to be a new direction with Danger Mouse production influences throughout.  That album is a new interesting direction, but good?  More time will tell.  It is for sure that the direction Chulahoma took was spot on.  A groovey bluesy achingly immaculate tribute to an underground legend in Junior Kimbrough.  Oh if only it had been a full album, alas six brilliant songs to make any blues lover gush.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This was a great movie concluding the Ori dillema that was present in the last seasons of Stargate. the service was reasonable and prompt.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|My sweetheart loves Christmas, so every year I am on the lookout for a new CD that might be nice to listen to on the rare chance we get to drive together. This CD ended up being played at home quite a bit this last Christmas, and here's why.<br /><br />While you might find any number of old familiar Albums, I get kind of tired of the stuff that my folks might have played in the 60's when I was small (well besides the Chipmunks... I mean that's classic). That leaves mostly three choices, Motown/ Rock and roll versions, Country versions (some of which are actually quite good) Or the Modern \\"Pop Diva\\" versions, and for me that is the worst, because they are more about showing how many times they can make vocal runs go up and down the scales, and I am just so sick of that.<br /><br />Well here is a pleasant alternative.<br /><br />The arrangements are simple and you can sing along, which is kind of the point with a Christmas CD, and the vocals are filled with such warmth and if I can say it right, a reserved (adult) enthusiasm. Again, Ms. Krall simply makes me believe her performance, and that is why I love this CD.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|What motivated R.E.M. to create such a short, sharp shock of an album ? Could it be a reaction to the reaction against Around the Sun ? A defiant middle finger to the band members' middle age ? No matter to me. All I can say is that the good news of an R.E.M. album that I instantly love, and that hasn't left my cd changer, is news I will happily share with fans old and new. Accelerate is exciting and intriguing. I knew they'd finally pull their heads out of their rear ends...
B00005N9CV|5.0|I have become so hooked on Diana Krall, simply becase she sings with such emotive warmth, she makes it feel personal,(no, not in a creepy stalker way... in a good way!)and it can make your less than perfect day seem just a little bit better. Album highlights are S'wonderful, Cry me a River, and Besame Mucho, but entire Cd is very good.<br /><br />The perfect music to unwind or romance to.<br /><br />Thank you Ms. Krall!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I watched this movie fairly recently. I had heard and read some good reviews about it, so I decided to purchase it for myself to see if it would live up to its hype. It ended up being slightly better than I expected it to be. I wouldn't necessarily say that it's my all-time favorite movie. It's not every day that a movie that is mainly about a rat chef can be as entertaining as Ratatouille was. It's hard to say exactly what makes it be so good. I'm thinking that one thing that made it better than some movies is the fact that it didn't have a sappy or predictable ending. All in all, this is definitely a movie worth buying if you haven't already done so. A true classic animated movie if there ever was one.
B000002H97|5.0|The self titled album by the mighty metal monster that is Metallica was, is, and will forever be, one of the greatest albums ever. Not only in the narrow slice of the music world that is 'metal', but in music in general. The sound is heavy, yet clean and crisp, and the overall feel is that of an album complete. Truly a testament to the superiour ear and skill of producer Bob Rock, who took the fast, wild, and savage sound of Metallica and turned it into this. Make no mistake, I am a huge fan of early metallica. Have been ever since I was a child, but the sound of the black album is phenomenal.    Then, of course, there are the songs. I dare you to find a single guitarist who doesn't know how to play, at least part of, \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", and any electric guitarist who doesn't know how to play \\"Enter Sandman\\". The songs on this album are all good, most of them great even. The solo in \\"God That Failed\\" is perhaps one of the best solos ever put on vinyl (or well, CD), and the riffs of \\"Sad But True\\" and \\"Enter Sandman\\" are biblically magnificent. It was this album, and this album alone, that opened up the treasure chest that is the wonderful sound of Metallica to the uninitiated world, and made fans of pop and rock listen to metal. It helped, in no small way, to bring metal as a genre out of the semi obscure darkness in which it hitherto had been laying, and out into the broad dalight of the charts. Many bands have followed, and they all have this album to thank for it.    The perfect album doesn't exist, but \\"Metallica\\" is really close. Highest possible recommendation.
B0013D8LOK|3.0|Well I must say the highly touted `Sweeney Todd', the musical romance about a wronged man turned cannibalistic serial killer is a rather tough review for me. On the one hand I want to reward the film high marks for its creative approach, imaginative sets and gothic flair. I'm also an admirer of Johnny Depp and his bizarre body of work so that would suggest a possible 4 ½ or 5 star rating.<br /><br />However on the other hand, I'm not a fan of the new CGI techniques ala `Sin City' and `Beowulf' so that definitely was not a plus for me. The storyline and violent visuals were also a bit too graphic for my particular tastes and the main characters though well developed and expertly portrayed were not likeable thus making the establishment of a personal, emotional connection with their plight rather difficult.<br /><br />Furthermore, since this is a musical one's like, or dislike of the performance numbers must be taken into consideration as well. I found the music to be somewhat tedious for the most part, lacking any real memorable songs that one would care to listen to outside the confines of the film.<br /><br />`Sweeney Todd' is definitely one of those movies you either fall madly in love with, or don't \\"get\\" at all. I guess I just didn't get it. My Rating: 3 ½ Stars-.
B000002UZ1|1.0|The copies are from either Brazil or Argentina, this is not stated in the product information.  The Vendor, Innuendo has not sent the requested return call tag, and has indicated that it will not give a refund if the product is un-wrapped.  It was never wrapped in a factory shrink with the tamper tape on top.  I suspect that the vendor may be selling bootleg and/or pirated copies.  Buyers beware of purchases made from Amazon and Innuendo.  This is product misrepresentation that isn't disclosed until the shipping invoice is sent. 'Caveat Emptor.'
B000FQJAIW|3.0|I purchased this DVD in order to get the origanl release copy of the movie. I like this DVD I just wish it had the extras on it. I can't understand why it wouldn't come with the extras. Shame on George Lucas and FOX studios for this oversite.
0143038419|5.0|I'm reading the reviews that have come previously about how supposedly Elizabeth Gilbert is self-absorbed and has any other number of negative character traits.  Well, here's my take on it.  One, it's a MEMOIR, which means it's about the person who is writing the story, what they are feeling, experiencing and interpreting.  Two, it takes guts to admit and embrace that you don't want a typical marriage/kids/suburbs life.  It's not for everybody.  But these feelings obviously tended to piss off a few readers of her book.  Personally I would love an opportunity to do what she did.  I found her experiences to be enlightening, funny, and profound.  One of the best reads in the last year in my humble opinion.  Elizabeth, thank you for sharing your adventure.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|I recently purchased the bluray 5 disc collector's edition, and after watching it, it's a must buy for anyone who enjoyed it in theaters. First disc is the director's final cut, which is my favorite, the plot, the ending, everything is more believable. Disc, 2 and 4 are dual layer dvds, the extra stuff, creation of blade runner, etc. Disc 3 has all 3 versions on it. So those who like the voice overs can enjoy them. Disc 5 is the workprint version. Subtlety changes, longer action scenes. The visuals on this movie is great, they did a great job restoring it. Highly recommended.
B0000636NQ|5.0|I have mentioned in other reviews, how highly I regard Alvin Lee. Many others have given you their long winded reviews of this musical offering. My crique is more simple and to the point. This CD/album changed the description of what is required of a rock/blues/jazz guitar player. Alvin is cemented into the top five rock & roll guitarist and to be truthful, he is actually in the top five axe players of ANY genre.<br /><br />I had the great fortune of attending TYA in concert, as the middle act on a three act show in 1970, where the great Muddy Waters was the headliner. Ten Years After stole HIS show! In truth, Alvin Lee stole the show. I was in total awe of this man with his fret speed. The ONLY other artist I ever saw that was in his league with speed, is/was Johnny Winter (another on my top five list). What is so unique about Alvin, is the clarity that he maintains with such speed. Many times, he is so clean and fast that his guitar comes across as sweet as a violin.<br /><br />This is as close as you'll get to hearing what Bill Graham and others found amazing as a live performer! Graham continued to use TYA at both Fillmores and at Winterland. TYA's album \\"Live at the Fillmore East\\" is a steal on Amazon MP3 download for $8.99 for the two disc set.<br /><br />If you are new to TYA, \\"A Space In Time\\" (in my humble opinion) is their best studio offering as a group.<br /><br />It appears I've found myself being long winded too. It is hard not to be when reviewing a LIVING LEGEND. Buy it and smile:)
B0014CQNTK|4.0|Sixteen-year-old Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) has just discovered she is two months pregnant.  The father is her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).  Her first thought, naturally, is to have an abortion.  But when she can't go through with that, she decides to find a nice couple to adopt it.<br /><br />Of course, finding Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) was just the beginning.  She also has to tell her dad and step-mother (J. K. Simmons and Allison Janney).  And she has to carry the baby to term while attending classes at high school.  How will she handle the next few months?<br /><br />If you are thinking about seeing this film, you should take the PG-13 rating seriously.  The movie, especially the first third, is filled with crude language and talk about sex.  I expected that going in, but it still made me cringe.<br /><br />Fortunately, once the movie gets going those things are kept to a minimum.  The story is only slightly realistic, but I got so caught up in it I really didn't care.  They even manage to throw in a twist or two to make the movie unpredictable.<br /><br />This movie works because of the characters.  You absolutely love them from the start and want things to work out well for them.  And the characters work because the acting is universally great.  Ellen Page deserved his Oscar nomination.  In my eyes, the other standout is Jennifer Garner.  You could actually feel her character's longing to have a child.<br /><br />The movie is a comedy, and I did laugh out loud.  Most of the time, however, I chuckled and smiled.  Still, it had a warmth to it that was absolutely charming.<br /><br />Some critics have argued this movie glorifies teen pregnancy.  Frankly, that is a risk any movie runs when it tries to deal with a sensitive subject like this.  While it doesn't dwell on the negatives of the situation (hence my comment about the story not being realistic), it doesn't make things rosier then they are either.  In the end, it is a life affirming movie that is about people taking the twists and turns of life and dealing with them the best way they know how.<br /><br />And for that reason, I liked this movie.  Yes, the first third had me cringing more then I expected to.  But it was a film well worth seeing.le taking the twists and turns of life and dealing with them the best way they know how.    And for that reason, I liked this movie.  Yes, the first third had me cringing more then I expected to.  But it was a film well worth seeing.
B000I2MRHE|4.0|[[ASIN:B000I2MRHE Lamaze Spin & Explore Garden Gym]]    My daughter received this when she was 1 month-old.  A little too young, but I set her in it periodically.  She is now 4 1/2 months-old and has learned to spin herself around and will stay entertained for about 20 minutes.  I have enjoyed it.  I was not good at doing tummy time with my older daughter who did not like her tummy and needed to be entertained during tummy time.

B0000A0DRY|5.0|1966 and 1967 were the peak years of Western pop and rock music, as far as I'm concerned. So much great music came out in a short span of just two years - the Beatles, the Kinks, the Doors, the Who, Jefferson Airplane, Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, the Beach Boys, and other groups put out a series of superb singles and albums. Right in the middle of this period, in February '67, the month the Beatles released their greatest single \\"Strawberry Fields Forever / Penny Lane\\", Jefferson Airplane released their second LP \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\", one of the landmark albums of the 60s. Airplane's two best and most successful singles \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\" came from this album.    \\"Pillow\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable mixture of harder and softer rock, with a Byrd-esque/Simon&Garfunkel-esque folk rock flavoring, but laced with psychedelic sounds and lyrics. The album starts off in grand style with the wonderful riff-based rocker \\"She Has Funny Cars\\", a title that has nothing to do whatsoever with the actual lyrics. The song alternates between harder verses of descending notes and lovely softer verses - and ends with a delectable explosion of psychedelic guitarwork (it's a pity this wasn't put in the middle of the song as well). Ten songs later, the album (i.e. the original LP) ends with the fabulous \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\" which sounds to me very much like a Simon & Garfunkel song that strayed into a Jefferson Airplane album - the singer could be Paul Simon, but it's Marty Balin.     In between, we have JA's two best-known songs (the hit singles I mentioned - and yes, they're both glorious!), a couple of beautiful ballads, one hard rocker (\\"3/5 of a Mile\\") and several melodious mid-tempo tunes. And then there are the bonus tracks, the most outstanding being the blues epic \\"In the Morning\\" and the sizzling rocker \\"Go to Her\\" - these songs are magnificent. In fact, this second version of \\"Go to Her\\" is probably one of the greatest rock 'n roll tracks ever recorded - amazing singing, amazing guitarwork! (The first version - on JA's debut album - isn't bad either.) And speaking of electric guitarwork, I don't think any group matches JA in this area.    There's also a short instrumental (\\"Embryonic Journey\\") which has been highly praised - for sure, it's nice acoustic guitar, but I prefer the much longer, darker, and eerier electric-psychedelic \\"Spare Chaynge\\" on JA's next album \\"After Bathing at Baxter's\\", another great must-own record. JA's debut \\"Jefferson Airplane Takes Off\\" is also indispensable. By the way, all three of these CDs (the 2003 versions) come with booklets with excellent liner notes and great photos.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|First the bad:    1) The packaging is horrible.  I think they are trying to save some oil in shipping costs!  2) The beginning of the soundtrack sounds like something stolen straight from the TV show Lost.  3) Ending feels a bit rushed.  4) Drags on in spots.    Now the good:    1) Daniel Day-Lewis deserved that Oscar!  Best acting performance I have seen in a long time.  2) Cinematography is outstanding.  3) The script is almost perfect.  There are no filler words.  4) Lovely descent into madness.  5) The more you think about the movie after you have watched it the better it gets.    Conclusion:    This is a movie for thinkers.  You get out of this movie what you put into it.  There is meaning in everything.  Daniel Plainview was a bad dude.  Watch this movie to see one of the best acting performances ever.
B000E1MTZE|4.0|What can I say about these films that haven't already been said. You either love them or at least hate the final 2 movies..The first film, The Matrix is a must see by any Sci/Superhero film lover.  The image quality is great on all 3 films and the sound is fantastic. At half the price this set is a steal.    Get it.
068987474X|5.0|Greg has soooo spared women the heartache of millions of women should they buck up and take his advice!  So many women make the mistake of making excuses for lame-duck relationships or would-be lame duck relationships, because of their inability to read the \\"red flag\\" warnings.    I found this book honest being reproach and highly entertaining.  I saw myself saying alot of these things in the past, and although I don't need the advice these days, I was more than happy to pass it along to someone who does!    Thanks, Greg!  You ROCK!
B00008Y3VA|5.0|I picked this compilation up on Amazon and am very happy with it. The 2 disc set is loaded with classic heep and it's all remastered and sounding better than ever. All the songs are full length and in cronological order too! If your not sure what albums you want to buy by the band or just want a really good wide view of them....this is the way to go. The set includes the hits as well as the deep album cuts.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|When I first heard that Johnny Depp and Tim Burton were adapting a violent, bloody musical for the silver screen, it sounded absolutely perfect. But could they pull it off? Well, the answer is a resounding.... yes!<br /><br />This is a violent, humorous, and delightfully odd tale of vengeance and madness. It has everything you'd expect from a Burton film: his signature dark, fantastical visual style, beautiful sets, great cinematography, and top-notch acting. But what about the singing? Well, it works just perfectly. Music usually plays a large role in Burton's films, so the step up to a musical feels almost natural. And who knew Johnny Depp could sing so well? He does such a fine job as the titular revenge-driven barber. He definitely deserved his Golden Globe win and Best Actor Oscar nomination for this stellar performance.<br /><br />From the opening credits to the breathtaking final shot (one of my favorite endings in cinema history), this film succeeds brilliantly on every level. It's quite possibly the best film of Burton and Depp's careers. And that's really saying something.
B00000DMJF|5.0|If you like the Beatles, this album is a must have -- the music is absolutely fantastic!
B00104QSOM|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis have collaborated to create something really special. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's definitely my favorite of 2007.<br /><br />The highlight of the film is the acting. I can't even describe just how good Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is. His Daniel Plainview is such a complex, engrossing character. I can confidently say that this is one of the finest pieces of acting I've seen, possibly the finest. He walked away with pretty much every major lead actor award for his portrayal of the greed-driven oil man and it could not have been more well-deserved.<br /><br />Also, Paul Dano turns in a great performance as the creepy young charismatic pastor Eli Sunday. His character's battle with Plainview is one of the most interesting parts of the picture. The two men are so different, and yet so alike. Each are ambitious in their own way. Daniel's methods are fairly straightforward; he wants to get at people's oil as cheaply as possible in order to gain power and to make a fortune. Eli's motivations are a little more complex; he wants to use his position as a \\"man of God\\" and a \\"faith healer\\" to gain respect, honor, and ultimately (like Daniel) a fortune. But we never clearly discover if Eli is a phony. Whatever the case, he's clearly a giant hypocrite.<br /><br />There are a lot of other themes and interesting things going on. Everything just works so well. The cinematography is gorgeous. Anderson's direction is superb. The writing is top-notch. Jonny Greenwood's innovative score sets the mood perfectly for this dark oil epic. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is simply a masterpiece.
B000Z66RSS|4.0|this cd was good.most the songs make u wanna get up n literally dance.i was impressed with the mix.and yes i would recommend it 2 others.thanks amazon for the great prices 2 on their cds n dvds too.

0307346617|4.0|I read this through in about a day. It's entertaining and action packed. I liked the separate vignettes and how they often wove together. Definitely worth getting or at least checking out from the local library.
B00005JPY1|5.0|A perfect representation of what Batman is. It's not just a comic, or an imaginary hero, but an idea of complete unselfishness. Beautiful.
B00154GEFU|3.0|Much like the review from Glenn O. Kirms, I must say that this album feels like a John Wetton solo album.  The music is OK but it never rises to the level of greatness we heard on \\"Asia\\" or, to a lesser-degree, \\"Astra\\".  There's just not enough of the hard-driving sound of \\"Sole Survivor\\" or any of the really great songs on \\"Asia\\".  Additionally, the songs have a too-similar sound and almost seem to run together.<br /><br />All in all, this is OK but just should have been so much more.
B000PHX8C0|5.0|Devil Driver's Cd's always somehow get even better than the one's before them. This Cd will be very hard to top, but let's enjoy it for the masterpiece it is. They are the best metal band going right now, and actually get increasingly heavy on each CD. If you dig DevilDriver, also check out Skinlab, the new SkinnedAlive live CD is incredibly brutal...[[ASIN:B0015RZAWK Skinned Alive]]
B000YDOOUK|5.0|I bought this album think I would like a few songs and then would try to justify the $11.99 price for those songs.  But when I popped this CD in, it stayed in.  This album rocks from start to finish and all you want is to play it again.  I can't say when the last time I heard an album the rocked the whole way through.  The energy is extremely high and you feel like you can bench press a freakin car after you've just listened to it.  This is a band truly dedicated to the meaning of Rock, nothing soft on this album, only for those who truly want to rock.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Sticky Fingers is close, but for overall quantity of good songs on one disc - this is probably it! Not \\"knocking\\" their other disc's (they have plenty of good ones), or individual songs on others - but overall, for number of good rockers/quality tunes on one album I like this one.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Got this dvd last week and did my first day on Monday. Let's just say 15 minutes into level 1, I had to sit down and catch my breath. I consider myself to be fit and typically workout 4-5 times a week for an hour, so I thought this would be a piece of cake but oh, I was sooo wrong. So if you want a short intensive workout that gets results get this dvd. I gave it 4 stars because Jillian does not count or give good cues.
B00154GEFU|3.0|This is a pleasant-sounding album and I'd say is \\"fine\\", but it, like Alpha, lacked the intensity and great hit singles that the debut album had in droves.      What jumped out at me was how laid back Howe was compare to the original album, and even compared to Alpha. His absence was a huge blow to the sound of Astra (not to mention lame writing), so I figured his return would be amazing and highly intense.  It wasn't.  A great guiarist still, but instead of being ALL OVER every song, again like in the debut album, he just seems to sit back comfortably for the ride.  I don't get it.    At least Wetton's voice 25 years later is pretty much every bit as good as it was then.    The remainder of this is an email my muscially astute friend sent me, and he hits the nail on the head:      \\"That first album they just had the perfect mix of progressive music but with a pop sensibility; good songs with a lot of subtle touches of ultra-fine musicianship that they didn't let get in the way of the song itself (which is a pitfall too many prog rock bands - nearly ALL of them! - aren't able to avoid; they get too self indulged with playing their instruments and forget that SONGS MATTER).    Since then though, they just seem like 4 really talented guys playing....  pop music.  I imagine there are some exceptions and they've got some decent cuts here and there, but for the most part, I would bet that 80-90% of their best songs would come from the debut.    Which to me, them copping out like that is worse than something like... Wham!  With Wham, that's the best those sissy-boys could do.  But when you have Steve Howe, Carl Palmer... the other guy {an inside joke here}, plus a voice like Wetton's and all you play is watered down pop.  Well... you should be tased.  Multiple times.\\"    Oh, and they messed up.  They didn't name the album with a word starting with \\"A\\"!  ;-)
B00003CXTF|5.0|I bought these two Vhs sets watched it from the beginning to the end.   It was a extraordinary movie of world war 11.I do not know why people put this movie down.Did they see what I watched? The Most Astounding Attack on our country.That will live forever in infamy.Also a heartfelt tribute to the men and women who lived it.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I love this music/sound: the old school jazz/motown/swing. I love it! He reminds me of Harry Connick Jr. because he remakes the songs of the \\"older\\" generation. He does a great job and this CD is really good. I love the song, \\"Everything\\" because it's an original but also because it makes me feel good. The covers he does are good too...so I highly recommend this CD.
B000002BQK|2.0|After watching American Idol tonight, and watching and hearing Mariah's newest release - a truly moving number - I'm ready to get back in her corner. It's been awhile.    As a huge Mariah Carey fan, I had always bought all of her albums, But this album, Butterfly, turned me off so much it took a long time to overome it. The opening song, Honey, was so bad, and the video so suggestive and vulgar,  that I was turned off for years, and haven't bought a Mariah album since.     I know that wasn't fair - though not unlike the downturn another favorite, Olivia Newton-John took for several albums. But she has matured in recent years, and is again one of my favorites. So maybe the Mariah I missed is back. I still cannot recommend this album - I believe it is by far one of her worst.    But Mariah is still an incredible talent, and \\"Bye Bye\\" is so good, I may give \\"Butterfly another chance!!!
B0001GL3K4|5.0|One of my favorite movies so I bought this for a friend for Christmas and she loves it! Great quality and good price. I highly recommend this movie/product!
B000YABYLA|5.0|Comedies like this are often forgotten about when it comes to Awards.  Of course, an award doesn't make a movie, but it's nice to show appreciation.  Little Miss Sunshine should have won Best Picture in 2007, just as this should have won this year.  More people can relate to this movie than they can No Country For Old Men or There Will Be Blood.    Ellen Page deserved Best Actress for this as well.  The role was so natural, you felt like she really was pregnant, really in love with Michael Cera (amazing performance as well).  When she was in labor, you felt like she really was in pain.  You don't get performances like this every year.    Also take into account that this movie indirectly closes some gaps between people who are pro choice and pro life.  This movie makes it that pro choice people aren't always for abortion, just keeps it on the table.    For a 5 star performance from every cast member, get this movie and get it now!
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is a brutal and disturbing tale about a young adolescent and his friends fighting together in gangs and how they disrupt society. The book takes place in the future where the main character, Alex, and his fellow \\"droogs\\" cause chaos and use their own invented slang throughout the book. Alex cannot help being violent, it is just who he is. He and his \\"droogs\\" go around beating people up, causing disturbance to the society around them, and rape. The book then takes a turn and Alex tries to change who he is and redeem himself; yet can you change who you naturally are? It offers the question of free will and the struggle between good and bad. It also shows the maturing and growing up into adulthood and change of mind. It is a page turner and a fascinating novel.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Some of the other reviews I've read about this product mention the shody packaging and lack of reference cards to point to a specific episode.  The product I received was in perfect order and nothing was broken.  I don't mind the layout of the disks, but I can see how it could be difficult to locate a specific episode (you must leaf through the folder-like disk holders and read the label on each disk.  I guess I don't mind because I have been such a fan of the series for so long that I somewhat know the order of the episodes by heart.  If I am looking for a specific episode from Season 5, I know generally where it is.  But, I can appreciate the complaint.  I do like the efficiency of the packaging.  It holds the entire 7 seasons' disks in a very small space.  Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you have an HD system with Blu-Ray player or PS3, you have to get this one.  The cinematography and narration are great. The only thing I would have liked to see would be more content, like the extras they had when the series was broadcast on Discovery last year.
B000FVNX2Q|3.0|I LOVE RPN and this calculator is a good one when it comes to doing calculations.  The downside is that it's not really well built at all.  The CLx key, used very frequently, now requires a very hard push to get it to clear the screen.  I called HP, and unfortunately, once it's out of warranty, they won't fix it, so this calculator is now one of the most annoying calculators I've ever had to use, pushing the CLx key hard every time makes me recommend that you skip this calculator and get something that is as reliable as the older HP's used to be.
B00000I07P|5.0|The mid to late 80's, 1986-87 in particular, was a great time for music. This album came along at just the right time for me, age 11-12, just when I was really starting to get ''into'' music.  I love almost all of the music from this time period, and this album is no exception.  A friend of mine had the cassette, and when I would go over to visit we would listen to the tape from start to finish.  At the same time, take the liner notes and work on memorizing all the lyrics.  I now have the newly remastered CD, and when I pop this in the player, I still listen from start to finish.  The new remaster is great, this album sounds better than ever.  This is pop-metal at it's finest.  From start to finish, all songs are  great.  To listen, brings back great memories, and is still great today, in my book. 'Wanted Dead Or Alive', 'You Give Love A Bad Name', 'Livin On    A Prayer', Never Say Goodbye', many great classics are here.  For me, there's nothing else I can add, just let the music do the rest of the talking.  Buy it, listen, and rock on!
B0010358D0|4.0|I'm not good at communicating in English; therefore, the following review and all of   my comments and writings you read herein probably won't make any sense or very  difficult to read and comprehend at the first place:  I just hope that no one would be  offened or feel bad by reading them.  I just wanted to express and share the good   feelings and enjoyment that I experiened watching this movie.      So, here I go:  I liked this DVD presentation package very much indeed.  As a product,   this nicely metal-cased Two-Disc Special edtion give us a high quality 3D anime movie   on our living room monitor screen without loosing its picture quality seen in a local   movie theater with the hi-def image and sound at their highest levels, all neatly packed   in an easy-to-store slim heafty metal case.  I thougt it looked really appealing felt nice  when you hold it in your hands.    The studio did the best they could to sustain its original quality with carefully perform-  ed the English dubs.  (Yes, I missed the original voice casts whom I liked very much   and I understand that some of the viewers commented how much they were dis-  appointed to find out the change.  Still, I was really impressed with those American/  Canadian engineers and voice actors' greate efforts and cares that had been poured   on to produce the English version, watching the surplimental materials.)    One thing that I could ask for was a documentary or commentary that showed or intro-  duced the behind-the-scene producton notes or materials, following/retracing the movie  with some interviews from the director, production staff members.      Otherwise, this is a great DVD set to purchase.
B000001FTJ|5.0|Tom Waits-Swordfishtrombones *****<br /><br />My relationship with Swordfishtrombones is as follows; there are days where I will feel that this album is Waits' best, then there are other days where I think it is just another one of Waits' great albums but certainly not is best. regardless of which day it is I do feel that it is among the elite in Waits' cannon. If it is not the best it is for sure one of the best he ever released, and is with out a doubt the second best he released during the 1980s, right behind the amazing Rain Dogs.<br /><br />This was a departure for Waits away from his almost crooner style he had created for himself. During the 1970's he was very much the musical equivalent of Charlie Chaplin. A tramp if you will. The lyrics are still the same; that whole beat writer meats Bob Dylan in the town cafe, but it is the music, the junkyard flavor of instrumentation that is so different. Instead of the basic jazzy out fit he lobbied for break drums, and glass harmonicas to name just a few. But more then that is the strange time signatures he used that would make even the great Frank Zappa scratch his head in amusement.<br /><br />Songs like the albums opener 'Underground' and 'In The Neighborhood' come like a complete culture shock almost to the fans of old Waits. The amazing title track sounds fresh and new yet it still holds on to the Waits material of the 1970's. 'Gin Soaked Blues' is a rough electric blues, while 'Soldiers Things' is downright melancholy. 'Franks Wild Years' was a sign of this and the next two albums, and 'Down, Down, Down' is pure bliss. But perhaps it is the genius of '16 Shells From A Thirty-Ought Six' that most makes the album. Eventually the great Bob Seger would cover this but not to the same accord. Waits' original version is cool, and chilling. The strongest track off the album easily.<br /><br />Swordfishtrombones was Waits' tribute album to the great Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band. He did a swell job I must say. This is truly for those looking for something a little different but still intelligent. Swordfishtrombones is a true classic.omething a little different but still intelligent. Swordfishtrombones is a true classic.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|An Irishman (Glen Hansard) in Dublin is a vacuum repairman by trade, but musician by heart and he plays his songs on the streets.  There he meets up with a Czech immigrant (Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;) they strike up an easy friendship over their love of music and of course, a broken Hoover.<br /><br />Over the next couple of days they share their music, write songs together, and then eventually record an album.  All the while they are building a friendship that borders but never crosses to romance because of his love for an ex and her rocky marriage.<br /><br />The music was written and performed by the actors and the result is magical.  As I sit here typing this review, the songs are happily playing in my head; memorable melodies and haunting lyrics. The credits had barely started rolling when I hopped online to order the soundtrack.  He plays guitar and has a voice that is sexy and powerful.  She plays the piano and has a voice that is sweet and angelic.  Together they are superb.<br /><br />There is something so sensual about really good music, the way every note and word can touch every inch of your soul and take over your heart.  I was literally moved to tears by a few of the songs in this film, not because they were sad, though some were, but because they were so beautiful, so perfect.<br /><br />Every ONCE in a blue moon I will watch a film that will captivate me from the start and stay with me long after it's over.  This is one of those films.  It touched me on so many different levels and evoked so many different emotions and thoughts.  I will watch this movie, listen to its soundtrack, repeatedly, and never tire of it, because it's just that good.<br /><br />The storyline is bittersweet and eloquent; a modern day musical about two people at a crossroads in their lives when they meet.  Each one gives the other one the shoulder and the shove they need to get on with and get what they want out of life.  A simple, but magnificent film with amazing music and actors; the result is unforgettable.  Brilliant.<br /><br />Cherise Everhard, April 2008Cherise Everhard, April 2008

0307120007|5.0|This is a true classic! I was read Pat the Bunny many, many times growing up. I recently bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it. The first time I read Pat the Bunny to her she was sitting in my lap on the floor.  We read it over and over and by the end of the day when her mom came to get her she was playing peekaboo and putting her finger in the ring.  The best part is whenever I pick up a book to read her, she climbs right back into my lap and that is an absolutely precious feeling.
B000YABYLA|5.0|This movie rocks!<br /><br />When it first started, I wasnt sure about all the funky lingo, but all in all a great movie.<br /><br />Ellen Page is amazing as Juno, this movie also has Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman in case you werent aware.<br /><br />Cheeseburger phones, orange tic tacs and a whole lot more.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended!!
B00004R9A4|5.0|Great product for children. Good old fashioned animation and wholesome storyline.  My child is two years old and prefers this to the newfangled cartoons of today.
0670018651|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much, but of course immediately looked for the ones that I wear, and couldn't find Armani's \\"Gio\\" nor \\"Acqua di Gio\\" (although I did find \\"Acqua di Gio pour Homme\\".

B00154GEFU|5.0|Everyone is comparing it to other CDs and other lineups. I have ben an Asia fan for 25 years. This is Asia. Steve Howe's guitar work is exemplary. John Wetton's vocals are right on the spot. I will admit  Carl Palmer appears to take a back seat as to the drumming.  Geoff Downes keyboards surround the CD. Keyboards have always played an integral role in Asia. I noticed that Wetton  wrote the majority of the songs. This is why his influence is felt more than the other  three. All and all it is  an atypical Asia CD. If you enjoy Asia you will enjoy this CD.  It is more mellow than previous CDs, however, just as enjoyable. Forget the  majority of the other reviews and simply listen to this new collection of the vintage Asia sound and production. The song No Way Back is one of the many standouts on the CD.  Welcome back Asia.
B000000H42|5.0|It's Amazing!! It's Exciting!!  It's Bigger than 2 Girls 1 Cup and The Soulja Boy combined!!  It's my 666th review, and naturally it only makes sense that King Diamond should fill this slot!<br />Oh yeah, the album is great too.  Oozing with satanic shrieks, it was ahead of it's time in the day.  To some it was actually considered scary and probably even threatening.  Satanic lyrics are very prevalent these days in metal bands, and come across about as evil and controversial as Don Henley.  King Diamond wasn't the first guy to write songs of the devil, but he may just be one of the first to really relish in it and shove it down the listener's throat.  It sounds a bit silly now, but his performance is still great regardless, and you can always remind yourself that most metal bands weren't really doing this stuff back then.  Musically, this band has talent and the muscle to back it all up.  Folks may chuckle at King Diamond's vocals and lyrics, but you don't hear many of them slamming the music, coz you can't really.  It's full of progressive touches and strong and solid riffs that hit you like Don Flamenco's uppercut.<br />A classic for sure, but you don't need me to tell you that.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's the number 2 selling DVD of all time on Amazon.  Even now, 5 years after the show's end, it's in the top 25 sold each day.  It is that good.  Even if you don't like science fiction, you will like this show.  While it's set in some far off galaxy, it's not about that, it's about people, plain and simple.  Great stories with drama, action and humor.  Please FOX or NBC or whomever owns the rights to this fantastic show, please bring it back.
1594489505|5.0|This book, though sad, is a good read. If you like fiction that  is a deeper than most, this book and the Kite Runner are good for that.  This book is a bit graphic and it's very sad, but it portrays  the  devastation war leaves behind. If you want to read something light this is not the book for you. I prefer novels like this which make you think and draw you in to the story. I recommend this book highly.
0805047905|5.0|My 7 month baby girl can't get enough of this book.  She loves the rhyming verse and the big color pictures.  I definately recommend it!
B00154GEFU|5.0|Asia's \\"Phoenix\\" holds up well when compared to their first three classic albums (1982-1985). This disc sounds and feels very 80's (in the best possible way) and gets more enjoyable with each listen. It's like a beautiful garden in the desert of modern music. As for the sound quality, it's pretty good, even though it's been mastered kind of hard.<br /><br />Carl Palmer said, \\"The new album sounds very Moody Blues.\\" I'd agree with that statement, but there's also a touch of ELO mixed in. But make no mistake, it sounds mainly like ASIA. If you're a fan of their original group, you will enjoy this disc as well.<br /><br />Thank goodness for bands like Asia (and Deep Purple) for not only reuniting, but also making quality new music.
0765318741|3.0|Well, I picked this book up after the movie came out and everyone was already talking it up.  The book is billed as \\"one of the greatest vampire stories\\" and while I thought it was good, it wasn't as suspenseful or scary as I had hoped.  The novel is very short and ends rather abruptly, and the majority of it is rather tedious.  It talks an awful lot about Neville's day to day activities, and the pacing seemed slow, especially for such a short novel.  I was irritated by how much liquor and glassware he wasted in the novel, it seemed he was constantly smashing his glass on the floor or the wall.  The part with the dog was the best part, really the first time I got in touch with the character.  The novel was decent overall, at least for the fact that it seemed much more realistic than the majority of modern vampire stories. If I had read this before all the hype was out, I probably would have liked it more.  I just was expecting something else.<br />I actually enjoyed the other short stories in the book better.  They were strange and often very confusing, with all the same outcome: is this person crazy, or is this stuff really going on?  Matheson does a good job at making the implausible seem real.  The book was worth it just to read a few of those short stories.
B0013K6WLM|3.0|After four albums with little production and raw blues riffs it was inevitable that TBK would spice things up with some new elements and a polished sound. Although I understand the change I definetly miss little blues numbers like \\"Run Me Down\\" and \\"Hurt Like Mine\\". TBK's first three albums were so good, all 4 1/2 to 5 stars, that I'm beginning to think not even TBK will ever be able to out-do themselves.     From what I've heard and read it seems like DangerMouse didn't get in the way of the band that much, but he was a big reason this album sounded different and it's obvious when his influence is heavy. In an interview I read, DangerMouse talked about which songs he had alot of input on, and those just happen to be the songs I like the least. For example,  \\"Remember When\\" Side A is the song I just skip on the album without question. I made myself listen and tried to give it a chance but it's just an experiment in production gone bad. \\"All You Ever Wanted\\" had a chance to be a great song if DangerMouse or whomever is responsible would have squeezed more out of the heavy ending and extended what was just getting interesting. Also there are a couple more effects DangerMouse added that just seem to be there for the sake of being there.    After making DangerMouse seem like the blues killer I should say there are a couple of things he did really well. I like that Dan's voice is more pronounced in most of the songs, he has a great blues rock voice and it should be a big part of all the songs. I think the piano and bango sound in \\"Psychotic Girl\\" and then the flute and production of \\"Same Old Thing\\" worked really well with the songs and made for two of the better songs on the album.     For me what makes this album a 3 1/2 star instead of a 3 is \\"Lies\\" and \\"I Got Mine\\". The sound and lyrics of Lies is bone chilling. Jus pure greatness. \\"I Got Mine\\" is a typical great Auerbach riff, and is the type of song I would play for someone who had never heard the Keys before. \\"Strange Times\\" has grown on me, but not what I think their single should have been.  \\"So He Won't Break\\" and \\"Oceans and Streams\\" are decent songs but I'm glad they didn't do more than two of these type of songs. I can't put my finger on it but they sound like a good Duran Duran song or something, that's probably a real bad comparision so someone comment and give me a better comparision!     One thing I would like to see TBK do on their next album is extend some of their songs and just groove a little bit. Also, I would like to hear a couple of strongs solos in the album. This band is awesome live and I would like to hear just a little of their spontaneity on an album.    Overall I like the album but I don't love it. Two songs that I love, 3-4 I really like, 3-4 that are ok, and 1 or 2 that I can do without.     ..I purchased a cd through amazon for the first time just so I could review TBK albums. I loath almost all modern music and until I was introduced to TBK I only consider myself a fan of bands that predated my birth. TBK is the real deal.
0618918248|5.0|Religion is MAN made, plain and simple. There are people who at one time lived on islands and never read (or could read at all) the Bible or knew of God, religion,etc. So, what does that say about religion? What about the Aztecs--who knew nothing of Jesus? Just because a group or groups of people set out to write a Bible does not mean that it is law or truth. It is and always was a way to control the masses. The operative word is Control--and it still works today by all MAN-made religions. Few people really understand the cruelty done in the name of God,religion, and Christ. Some of the most judgmental people on Earth are extremely religious and very controlling. All religions want to separate people into affinity believers. The world would be better off for people to believe in just treating others well instead of using their God to create an \\"us and them\\" atmosphere.  We don't need the Bible to tell us how to be good citizens, how to treat others well, how to care of our children, how to just be the best we can be. Dawkins is trying to point out that we are more intelligent than the Bible, the Koran,etc. or religions would have us believe. We are not sheep! The God of Man is just an ancient rule maker to subdue anyone who would THINK for themselves and perhaps challenge the status quo. Thankfully, some were brave and intelligent and broke away from that limiting behavior of the pack or we'd all be still siting around waiting for God to tell us how to get out of the rain.

I don't see why a 9 or 10 year old kid wouldn't be able to read it. It's not like a horror novel or something.
B0000025KI|5.0|The Boss at his peak. Surely, 'The River' has endured the test of time...I like it more now than I did when it was first released so many years ago. Like the work of artists he's always wanted to be like at least spiritually, Dylan and Van Morrison, 'The River' has never been easily digestible. All great work generally falls into that category...it takes repeated listening and sometimes years to grasp what the artist is presenting. And to risk the wrath of Bruce fans everywhere, I have to say that I think \\"Drive All Night\\" is the greatest song he's ever done. make yourself a Bruce mix tape or CDR and end it with \\"Born To Run\\", \\"Racing In The Street\\" and \\"Drive All Night\\". It does NOT get any better...

0060558121|1.0|I wanted to take some time before I write a review, just to calm down and sort out my thoughts. I know, I represent a small minority of readers. Why? Because I disliked the book. My personal description of the book is the dumbest book of the year 2007(I finished the book just before Christmas). I don't know why people like it so much.<br />I didn't like Gaiman's style at all.<br />The protagonist is a fool and you get tired of him 1/4 into the book as well as from others. There is no humour, the story and characters are flat and not interesting.<br />I just had to force myself through the story because:<br />a) so many people recommended it<br />b) to be qualified to judge the book<br />c) it was a long flight<br />I believe I am going to avoid Gaiman for quite a while. He is definitely not my cup of tea.

B0010X745K|5.0|This movie is the BEST Horror movie adapted from a Stephen King novel. The special effects are lively. The plot is suspenseful and full of twists. The acting is good.     What I like the most is it REALISTICALLY deals with ORDINARY PEOPLE'S psychology. For example, when it was clear anybody who left the supermarket would be killed, a lady asked \\"Who wants to escort me to my car? I need to pick up my children from home\\". All the men and women would not help her. It emphasized the fact that when death is lurking around, everybody is for himself.     From my interpretation, this film also conveys a message that \\"When human beings play God, the consequences are extremely unbearable.\\"    **** Warning. SPOILERS. Please do not read the comments below if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the movie. ****    There are two situations that back up the message above. First, the military experiments opened the window to the other world. That was when  the monsters came to town.     Secondly, at the end, the male character took the matters in to his own hand. Instead of letting other people decide their fate, he made decision for them. It turned out to be more disastrous than it should.    This mvie is on my list of BEST HORROR MOVIES of All Time.

B000WGWQG8|1.0|McCullough's excellent book is poorly treated in this mini-series. After watching the series you have no clue of what Addams or the founding fathers accomplished.     Addams and Hamilton are particularly poorly portrayed, you have have no clue to Addams fiery nature or Hamilton's financial dynamo and the impact they had on the creation of the country.    The series is ultimately boring because it give us no insight into the great accomplishment that was the lives of these men and women.     Much like the movie Ray at the end we have not yet seen what made John Addams great. Read McCullough's book or Ron Chernow's Hamilton, they give a sense of great adventure and accomplishment of these men.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|This was a fun movie. I'm not a big fan of horror flicks, so don't watch'em with any regularity. But, I do enjoy survival thrillers or whatever the specific label is that applies to \\"The Mist\\". (I can't remember right now. There is a well used label for just about every type of movie.) Anyway, I like this type of horror flick where you have people trapped, surrounded by some sort of monsters, they struggle to survive, fight the monsters, and then try to escape. The most interesting thing is the fighting that goes on between the people trapped together. Now, that is what works best in \\"The Mist\\" to me. The scariest monsters ultimately become some of the people your stuck with. And the movie is ultimately about us and our society. Well it's human nature too, that we are faced with, perhaps just as much as whatever has to do with America. The made-up monsters and nightmare scenerio in which a diverse group of people, a cross section of citizens -sometimes from very different backgrounds, becomes an exploration of real world social problems. Honestly, put me up against the monsters unleashed upon the town anyday, over some of the townsfolk(or city folk, to be fair). (I'm serious. You do NOT want to be trapped with Jesus Junkies if you want to survive.)<br /><br />Why the 1 Star deduction: Rating systems like this are kinda silly anyway, but 5 stars only go to works of perfection like \\"The Shinning\\" which is a perfect horror film classic. CGI is abused like hell by filmmakers these days and it's a shame. If they're going to use it I wish they'd use it well. You can tell when they cut corners and did not spend that extra time (and money)fleshing out the details of a creature. If you ain't got the funds to do it right, just leave more up to our imaginations please. Our imaginations are not all ruined by countless hours of video game play. A great idea is to still use puppets and models with CGI which can have incredible results. In several years all this CGI cr*p (&lt;-I don't know what words we can use on Amazon)is going to look much worse to us than it already does, leaving films of this period as dated as 1950s adventure films that used stop-motion puppets.hat words we can use on Amazon)is going to look much worse to us than it already does, leaving films of this period as dated as 1950s adventure films that used stop-motion puppets.

B000YABYLA|4.0|Teenage pregnancy is frequently a starting point for myriad philosophical arguments: some see it as a major problem, some see it as an argument for the need of early teaching of contraceptive technique and sex education, some see it as a reason for championing abortion, and some see it as a piece of life that confronts families in both positive and negative ways.  JUNO is a beautifully written (Diablo Cody) and directed (Jason Reitman) version of unplanned pregnancy offered by a splendid ensemble cast: it is a movie that could modify the sociologic outlook of many people in a very strong fashion.<br /><br />Juno (Ellen Page) is sixteen and talks her best friend Bleek (Michael Cera) into having sex: the result is a surprise pregnancy that Juno shares with her girlfriend Leah (Olivia Thirley) and the store clerk Rollo (Rainn  Wilson) even before informing Bleek, a likable  kid who seems fairly flat about the situation. After discarding abortion as a viable solution,  Juno informs her father (JK Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney) of her status, and tells them she is going to complete the pregnancy and give the baby to some loving and needy barren couple.  Her parents are at first flustered by the news, but quickly  become supportive in a way that tells us many things about the durability of successful families.  With Leah's help,  Juno answers an ad for 'wanted: baby' in PennySaver and visits the Lorings (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) who desperately want a child and embrace Juno's gesture of adoption with eager excitement. The remainder of the film follows Juno as her abdomen increases in girth, finding new respect for her parents and for Bleek, and inadvertently walking in the troubled waters of the Loring's marital discord.  Without giving the story away, the ending is so tender and free of  clich&eacute;  that it allows us, the audience, to appreciate all the vigor and sensitivity and humor and warmth of Juno - an example of developing maturity that is a fresh breeze compared to the usual teenage movies.<br /><br />Ellen Page does indeed deliver a pitch perfect performance, but her co-stars are equally fine: Simmons and Janney break away from their usual type cast roles brilliantly, and the other members of the cast (the entire cast) flesh out this well written story with great skill.  The mixture of animated graphics and the imaginative musical score enhance the flavor of the tale.  JUNO offers an unbiased look at the topic of teenage pregnancy and wins on every level.

B0009RJUVE|2.0|There have been many reviews of this book that point out the various flaws.  My biggest complaint is that the character of Chris is presented as a loving and caring one, but actually his treatment of Emily was  cruel.  Who dared her to go in the men's restroom when she was nine?  Who dared her to go down a ski slope that was too much for her, so she broke her leg?  Who kept pushing her to have sex with him at age 15 when she repeatedly said no?  And is it really love to let your best friend kill herself without trying to get help for her?  With friends like Chris, who needs enemies?  Chris comes across as an oppressive, possessive stalker, which might be the reason Em felt trapped.  This type of unhealthy attachment is what the two sets of parents should have noticed.

1582701709|1.0|P.T. Barnum said: \\"There's a sucker born every minute!!!!\\" This is verified in the five-star, sheeple reviews of praise for this excuse of a book. The \\"Secret\\" is a barely hidden sc*m which preys upon the most vulnerable. Those that fit that brand include the gullible, naïve, undereducated, wishful-thinking, lazy and feeble-minded.<br /><br />The \\"Secret\\" is harmful because its \\"advice\\" is neither sensible nor productive; it actively encourages degenerate values in the adherent/reader. Under \\"self-help\\" guise, this \\"book\\" misdirects its sheeple-readers not to work for goals but rather wish for them with stubborn fantasy. This is the root of its ills. It hamstrings the reader to actually not help himself, but childishly daydream about wants. Everyone who's attained success knows the root of that is hard work based on education/experience, yet this \\"book\\" decries said qualities. The \\"Secret\\" over-simplifies the alleged formula for success to such asinine lows that one has to question the author's audacity and the mental stability of the readers/adherents.<br /><br />The \\"Secret\\" is the law of attraction; this concept is misapplied with insanity and insolence. The shockingly idiotic claims are so ludicrous that adherence to them will retard the reader. The overly simplistic basis is that by emitting positive thoughts seeing oneself attaining what one desires, one will end up getting said desires because the \\"Universe\\" picks up this frequency, returning it. This asinine imitation of a thesis invites heavy-duty skewering.<br /><br />-Byrne doubtfully advises to dispel negative thoughts as they'll cause more negativity in a snowballing effect.<br /><br />This \\"advice\\" is cruel because it blames victims for mishaps that are beyond their control! I want the contributors of The \\"Secret\\" to tell 911 victims their loved ones were to blame for being on the \\"wrong\\" frequency! I want The \\"Secret's\\" contributors to tell Iraqis who are getting bombed by Al-Qaeda terrorists they're on the \\"wrong\\" frequency!<br /><br />-Byrne claims pretending to act like one's already received what one wants moves events to obey one's wishes.<br /><br />This misdirection is particularly noxious because it prods gullible people into delusion and something like schizophrenia (acting like you've already got results when they're not real!). Byrne abuses this \\"advice\\" to where she insolently forges a scenario in which she claims to have lost weight using the \\"Creative Process.\\" This sloganeering consists of ludicrously focusing on eating so one absolutely enjoys food. This will allegedly cause the person to \\"assimilate\\" food perfectly, resulting in \\"perfect\\" bodies!!!! Realistically, limiting carbohydrates and controlling portion size are the only ways to lose weight and keep it off.<br /><br />-Byrne purports that expecting things one wants and being grateful for one's present state manifest \\"good things\\" to come along.<br /><br />Assume someone has cancer for which there's no cure. No amount of Byrne-esque expectation is going to cure said terminally ill person despite the expectation that the cancer's going into remission. When someone's cells are devoured by cancer excessively, she dies; no expectation to the contrary's going to reverse that.<br /><br />Gratitude for something DOESN'T guarantee attracting more \\"good things.\\" Take the 110th Democratic Congress which was under the hallucination things were going their way after November's elections. Fresh from the euphoria of repossessing control after GOP rule, Democrats assumed they could manhandle Bush, especially on Iraq. What's occurred is successive victory for Bush regarding Iraq and laws relating to domestic surveillance despite the scant, Dem majority. The Democrats' gratitude for their November victory failed to result in prosperity; the opposite occurred with their approval ratings hitting the teens, lowest EVER for Congress.<br /><br />-Byrne alleges ignoring lack of wealth, pretending one can affordeverything, and visualizing checks builds wealth!<br /><br />This promotes relapse into role-playing, something destructive to anyone who wants to appreciate money, as an appreciation of money comes from hard work, education, financial literacy!!!! Byrne misleads the reader to fictionalize how swell things will be after wealth attainment; this ideology is the surefire way to remain underprivileged. One of the con-men \\"experts\\" (Schirmer) impudently advises readers to follow his doubtful path. His clownish \\"philosophy\\" was to \\"visualize\\" checks in the mail instead of bills! Based on this lame sc*m, Schirmer falsifies that today he gets only a few bills but mostly checks!<br /><br />-Byrne proselytizes that the reader IS God and the Creator.<br /><br />Byrne destroys any semblance of believability by her sacrilege. Her ploy is to pep-talk gullible readers into over-confidence. By this sacrilege, she's not only affronting religious people, she's also stretching credibility beyond feasibility. The contradiction is the reader who's desperately lured to this book due to struggles in life is brainwashed into thinking he's in a position of strength...ABSURD in the EXTREME!<br /><br />The book's presentation is censurable because the brainwashing should've been condensed into one paragraph. Instead, the book repeats the message (think positive to use the law of attraction to your benefit) ad nauseum to where it's simple-minded brainwashing. Byrne's cultivating a cult mentality in readers by repeating the same, hypnotic mantra in all chapters. This also is boring reading.<br /><br />I'll use The \\"Secret\\" against itself to wean suckers off this sc*m. I'm not thinking negative thoughts about The \\"Secret\\"--though I should--because they'll just boomerang to me. Instead, I will attract the desired result of getting the gullible readers to burn The \\"Secret\\" by wishing on it intently. I'm using the Creative Process to visualize my desired result of getting gullible readers to burn this book.

0201721481|5.0|First, I own the 2nd, 3rd and 4th editions of this book. I originally learned C++ from the 2nd edition in the early 90's (it's out of date). Later I bought the 3rd edition when the C++ standards were updated. Now, after a few years away from C++, I find that I have to catch up with the latest and greatest C++ idioms, methods, convential wisdoms, whatever.<br /><br />I started reading the 3rd edition and after 300 pages it became very obvious the 3rd edition was very encyclopaedic in its coverage and with its examples. The 3rd edition is an excellent reference, but for learning you need a month or more to read through the 1100+ pages. I don't have that much time. I needed something more concise -- so I bought the 4th edition.<br /><br />The 4th edition is still 800 pages in length, but the information density per page is less. The examples are cut back, but they are still good, and  tables are used to summarize different choices or variants to C++ syntax or libraries. These changes make the book vastly superior for learning C++ (relearning?). The examples demonstrate how to use the language and the tables convey the required information precisely. What a fantastic difference.<br /><br />The 4th edition does have a different organization, that is, the order the language is introduced has changed. The emphasis is on introducing templates and generic programming much earlier than before. The section on OO design and programming is excellent, but the emphasis on templates changes its relative importance.<br /><br />This may sound strange, but use the 4th edition to learn and use the 3rd edition as a reference.
0307265730|4.0|Recent Brooklyn transplant to a Seattle suburb near Lake Washington thirty-eight-year old Ruma (attorney-at-law), a twelve weeks pregnant stay-at-home mother of a three-year-old, lives with her non-Indian husband (MBA) who is away on business. Her father (PhD in biochemistry), who recently lost his wife and embarked on a series of group tours during which he became involved with a Bengali woman (PhD in statistics), stays with his daughter as a sort of vacation from vacationing. But the story of their relationship is overshadowed by unusual plot choices in statement or occurrence. Unlikely although not impossible (I looked them up): her mother's odds defying cause of death, the chances of taking a day trip to Victoria, B.C. with a youngster (over four hours one way), the fact that her exceedingly capable father can't locate himself a post office, and that he is forced to quit gardening one due to the presence of mosquitoes. As well, he writes to a friend (p 50) \\"no rain here [in Seattle] in summer.\\" Equally ridiculous are Ruma's ruminations related to her three-year-old son. She complains that he (p 10) \\"would throw himself without warning on the ground\\" and, not having told him about her pregnancy, \\"was convinced he'd figured it out already.\\" And although the adults use their hands to eat traditional Indian food, he's not allowed because: (p 22), \\"this was something Ruma had not taught him to do.\\" She even laments her father's grandfatherly care, complaining that (p 38), \\"He had not paid this sort of attention\\" when she and her brother (a Fulbright scholar) were growing up. Thankfully, things get better when the author moves to more familiar territory.<br /><br />Hell-Heaven, narrated by an Indian-American girl, is about an intelligent Bengali man (studying engineering at MIT) who is welcomed into her family and acts like an uncle to her. The girl's married infatuated mother becomes jealous of his relationship with a non-Indian student (of philosophy, parents are professors). In Choice Accommodations (my least favorite), an Indian-American man (managing editor of a medical journal, his father, an ophthalmologist) returns to the town where he went to an all-male boarding school to attend the wedding of the daughter of the school's headmaster. His non-Indian wife (an M.D.) accompanies him. Only Goodness (my favorite story because of its utterly imperfect characters) follows the relationship between Indian-American siblings: a young man's descent into alcoholism and the guilt-ridden, successful sister (masters in International Relations, Economics, her husband, an India born Englishman, has a PhD in art history) who believes she started him on that path. Nobody's Business, told from the perspective of a PhD candidate in Literature, tells of his infatuation with a 30-year-old Bengali girl (majoring in philosophy at NYU) and her Egyptian commitment-phobic boyfriend of three years (a Harvard Middle Eastern history professor).<br /><br />Part Two contains three related stories. The first, Once in a Lifetime, is narrated by one of two recurring characters, a 13-year-old girl (her Dad has a PhD), who, in 1981, is forced to give up her room for a month for the other recurrer, a 16-year-old boy, and his parents (Dad has a PhD in Civil Engineering), who plan to move back to the States. The last time they had seen each other was four years previously when her mother held a going away party for his family. Her mother is disappointed in the apparent change (for the worse) in his mother's behavior. The story ends with the revelation of a family secret. The second, Year's End, picks up a couple of years later, this time from the young man's view. He visits at Christmas and tries to fit in to a new family situation. The final story, Going Ashores, alternates between the lives of each of the two characters. She (a PhD) is visiting Rome while awaiting her wedding, an arranged marriage (to a physics professor at Michigan State, PhD). He (college grad) is also there. They meet unexpectedly through a mutual acquaintance and reestablish a relationship.<br /><br />Overall, the stories were excellent. I especially liked Only Goodness and those about Hema and Kaushik (except that the first was written as if Hema were speaking directly to Kaushik directly - and vice versa for the second). Unaccustomed Earth, although perfectly titled, is not as good as Interpreter of Maladies, but far better than The Namesake. Also good, A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry.here.

B000068FY1|5.0|I am not much of a music reviewer, but I just wanted to get my vote in.  I have owned this album since it was released and I keep coming back to it.  The songs are always fresh and leave me with a longing for other bands like the Jayhawks.  If a band can create an album like this just once in their career, they have done a great job.  I urge you to take a chance and buy this one, you won't regret it.
B00154GEFU|4.0|I have been a fan of Asia since the day that their debut album was released. I stayed with them through the John Payne years as well. Needless to say, this was one highly anticipated release for me. I picked up my copy less than an hour after it went on sale (could not wait for the mailman). Since I had psyched myself up so much, I was ripe for a letdown. Sure enough, on the first listen of the first six tracks, I was not blown away. I listened to the second half when I got to my office, and sure enough, the goosebumps came on the eighth track instrumental ending, Deya. By the time I got to An Extraordinary Life, I knew it was worth the wait.<br /><br />I would rate this release as much better than the garbage that pollutes the airwaves these days, and better than average by Asia standards. However, this is no 5-star effort in my book. This one can't top the first two, Asia and Alpha, or Aura from the John Payne-era. Therefore, it gets four stars after listening to it about six times these past two days. No, I did not listen to it that much because I went crazy over it, it's just that I only have 11 days to become familiar with this new material before I get to drive 200 miles to see them live again after 25 long years.<br /><br />The high points are the instrumentals Vortex and Deya, An Extraordinary Life (how can anyone NOT like that chorus?), I Will Remember You, and the second Steve Howe cut, Over And Over. If one were to ignore song titles, then I would say to get this CD for John Wetton's beautiful voice, who I rank right up there with Carl Palmer in his prime. The low points are the excessive repetition in places, especially No Way Back. Speaking of which, this song is sandwiched between two new-age sounding instrumentals, making it a long trilogy. Sorry, but this trilogy (Track 4) is NOT progressive, but is mostly annoying to this listener. The strong bass lines and keyboards backing the verses of No Way Back save this one from total disaster. I also don't care much for Alibis, and I find myself daydreaming once Orchard Of Mines gets started.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for progressive music, look elsewhere. If you are glad to see these four get back together, then this one is for you. As for me, I like both versions of Asia and my all-time favorite Asia cuts from the John Payne era outnumber the original version's by a margin of 2 to 1. Sure, this version will probably never produce anything as bad as some of the worst cuts from the Payne era (i.e. Boys Of Diamond City), but this foursome should have spent a little more time on some of these cuts. Gosh, any moron with a rhyming dictionary could write a better chorus than what is presented here on No Way Back. How about an aaba rhyme scheme for that one instead, with the phrase only allowed one repeat maximum?bis, and I find myself daydreaming once Orchard Of Mines gets started.

B000VI6T6K|2.0|I'm always interested in having the best audio version of any recording.  Therefore, when this new version was released, I picked it up and compared it to an older edition, the fourth disc of the Rhino [[ASIN:B000008IKZ Monterey Pop Box]], released in 1992.<br /><br />I was very unpleasantly surprised and dismayed to find the new disc does not have the clarity of the Box CD.  The drums & cymbals especially sound muffled.<br /><br />From a historical standpoint, it's interesting to hear the small snippets of Hendrix' conversation in between songs that do not appear on the Box disc, and yes, the new CD packaging & photos are excellent.<br /><br />However, it's no fun, after listening to the Box CD for the past 16 years, hearing a new version that has less clarity.<br /><br />I haven't heard the other versions of this show, released after the Rhino Box, but I sure can't recommend this one.
B000EWBKKI|2.0|In my mind when you are just slapping dvd auality on to a Blu-ray disk you are false advertising and ripping the public off.  No one needs or wants a blu-ray film simply for the disk itself but they want a better movie.  Sure they have the uncompressed audio but the picture quality sucks.  If you have the DVD keep it and foget this.    Great movie poor Blu-ray port
0375424474|4.0|This is really a neat little book.  It is very basic and should be an easy read for anyone with some anatomy education.  The author writes in a accessable manner, as if he is having a friendly converstation with you. My only criticism is I would have liked to see more detailed illustrations.   I recommend it if you want to get a glimpse into the evolutionary origin of the anatomic innovations that we take for granted, like having a head, two arms and two legs.
B00005JKHN|3.0|Very hard to find, unless the goofy Disney vault re-releases it. I had a problem with the sticker around the DVD hole as this was from a Utah library. It got stuck in my DVD player, had to open it and take it out. Other than that the movie plays fine.

But he keeps a journal, a journal not a diary, and best of all he keeps it in drawings.  Greg has problems with everything from pickup truck driving teenagers to girls like his geeky friend Rowley over him. Greg doesn't much care for Rowley but still hangs out with him whenever he can only because Greg's Dad wont let him play videogames at his house.  But when Greg does something unforgivable to Rowley and Rowley abandons him he realizes just how important having Rowley in his life is.  Now he has to do something really important to try and win Rowley back and still find a way to make it into the coveted spot in the yearbook of class clown.
0553296981|5.0|Great read, highly recommend for all jr. high and Sr. high kids. I read this book in high school (many many years ago) and wanted to read it again because of the movie \\"Freedom Writers\\" and it's integral part in the movie. I highly recommend it
B000E5KUK6|1.0|It's hysterical how the 1 and 5 star reviews are nearly equal on this pile of trash. Not that I expect anything else, as I believe 85%+ of people are idiots. The even split simply means that all of the 15% as well as 2 out of 5 idiots found this film to be the garbage that it is. That means the 4 and 5 star rating are from the dumbest of the dumb. And if that means you, please stop apologizing for bad films by saying dumb things like 'it's a popcorn movie' (popcorn isn't stupid) and 'why look for deep meaning in a film with with a giant lizard?'. This only proves how little thought these viewers use. The original 'Gojira' film had the giant lizard, too, and the whole story was an alegory on the threat of nuclear weapons. This one is an alegory on P.T.Barnum's most famous phrase (look it up). There is no reason an effects-laden action film can't also have some thought involved. Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich are overpaid putzes producing 'junk movies' for the braindead that walk among us. Lowest common denominator product. The rest of us expect more for our $10. This one insults you right to your face, and you thank them for it?

B000UFAURI|5.0|The Foo Fighters I predict will never issue a bad CD....the consistancy over the last 10+ years is beyond belief. Highly recomended for fans of all types of music. Similar to the new Fozzy All That Remains Reloaded on a song quality scale from start to finish. You must own these cd's
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Every song is packed full of energy and emotion, one is missing out if they do not give their ears this musical treat.
B0000549B2|3.0|This movie is only Ok in my book.  It has great production values, spirited performances and striking actors.  The trouble is the story isn't one that I come to care about.  The characters seem to be acting in their own space and rarely interact with each other.  It's hard to know whether Denzel Washington's character loves either of his women but you know who he is going to stay with because that woman is played by Spike Lee's sister.  The film in many ways is typical Spike Lee - long, takes place in New York City, etc. This time the variety of characters just don't jell as one whole movie.  It happens sometimes.  In other movies he's made the film comes together beautifully, in this one it just didn't happen as well.  That doesn't mean I haven't seen this movie more than once or discount it when talking of Spike Lee, I just think it is one of his lesser achievements.

B000N3ST9I|5.0|THis CD is like a great movie...the more you listen to it the more you notice new things each time. Brilliant band, and production.

Case in point the new Skinlab SkinnedAlive live CD, amazing CD with maybe the most crushing live recording ever captured...be sure and check that out as well!
B0015KO52S|5.0|Somewhere between [[ASIN:B000ION6DG Broken Boy Soldiers]] and \\"Consolers of The Lonely,\\" Jack White and Brendan Benson decided to toss the pop out the window and turn up the guitars. The distortedly wonderful result totally smacks down anyone who claimed the first album was a White Stripes Side Project or White helping out an old friend. \\"Consolers\\" makes the statement loud and clear from the first crashing chord and ringing snare drum on: The Raconteurs are a rock band.<br /><br />And like the Led Zep fixation that appeared on The Stripes' [[ASIN:B000OYC3J8 Icky Thump]], so goes this album. There are also more than a little salacious Stones jonesers banging (\\"Hold Up\\" being the prime love letter candidate for White's new friendship with Jagger and Richards, see his cameo on [[ASIN:B0013V2B2U Shine a Light]]). But there's also a sense that The Raconteurs wanted to expand wildly and delve into their classic rock collections, down to the old timey cover art's shades of The Band or Bob Dylan, who are also echoed in the country cool of \\"Old Enough.\\"<br /><br />Both White and Benson sound enthusiastic about these songs, something the more refined \\"Soldiers\\" was missing. Where BBS was all about the craft, \\"Consolers\\" is more about the feel. You even get to hear someone give directions (\\"double track this\\") during the title track, amping up the wall of sound until it pile-drives you into submission. This is an album that gets off on its power, and band seems more than eager to show off their chops and the new chemistry. Benson and White are often indistinguishable from each other as they trade vocal leads, that's how in-synch they've become and just how eager to play this album sounds.<br /><br />To that end, the rock may still be classic, but the detours are very cool and in context. The Spaghetti Western \\"Switch and The Spur\\" weaves a desert tale that seems derived from \\"Thump's\\" cover of \\"Conquest,\\" and the closing \\"Carolina Drama\\" is positively Dylanesque. The continual referencing the blues - Terry Reid's \\"Rich Kid Blues\\" cover in particular - give \\"Consolers\\" its gravity, all while incessantly driving from song to stylized song. It may be derivative, but it's my kind of derivative, and so far, it is one of this year's best.- Terry Reid's \\"Rich Kid Blues\\" cover in particular - give \\"Consolers\\" its gravity, all while incessantly driving from song to stylized song.

0743298039|4.0|This book continues the grand tradition of the classic gothic novels with crumbling houses, ghostly figures, mysterious disappearances, and tons of sepulchral atmosphere.<br /><br />The novel tells the twin tales of a enigmatic novelist and the biographer she hires to tell her true life story. Throughout the narrative we meet a small cast of characters, a couple of which come straight from central casting unfortunately. They all have important parts to play in this sweeping story, which plays out much like an archaeologist reveals the history buried in the dirt - one layer at a time.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale referenced in the title has to do with a missing story in a book by the novelist that everyone wants to know about. Her fans have been asking for ages about the story, and when some of them find out that the biographer is working with her, they try to get the biographer to tell them about it. It is a small but significant part of the book which speaks to the idea that life has many unknowns and does not always turn out the way we were hoping. Sometimes, try as we might, we all have a Thirteenth Tale that we leave unfinished.<br /><br />I listened to the audio book of this, and was extremely pleased. The two women reading the book did an excellent job differentiating the characters, not just by voice but by mannerism and personality.<br /><br />I took one star because, as I mentioned above, a couple of characters felt like they were lifted from other books. Setterfield does a good job making them feel somewhat fresh, nonetheless.
B00005JOA0|5.0|This movie is about people and situations that are not always what they seem.  A widow named Helen Graham--played skillfully by Tara Fitzgerald, along with her young son, move into an old estate and attempt to just live day to day, minding their own business.  The townspeople however, are very curious about the rather aloof newcomer and her overprotectiveness of her son.  Helen is a self dependant woman who sells her paintings to make a living, and does not wish to let strangers come too close.  One of the townspeople, Gilbert Markham--played by the ever handsome Toby Stephans, can not help but be drawn to Helen and wishes to learn more about her.  Helen hides a secret and eventually she shares it with Gilbert.  Helen is not the widow as she portrays.  She is married to a complete rake of a man, Arthur Huntingdon-played by the talented Rupert Graves, who has never been totally faithful to her. Arthur takes off months at a time to carouse with his buddies, leaving Helene alone to raise their infant son.  Later, when their son is a little older, the alcoholic Arthur and his band of goon friends force the boy to drink-which he promptly throws up-to make the boy become, \\"a man\\".  Arthur then hires a governess to teach the boy as punishment to Helen, keeping her away from the son she loves dearly, as she begins to despise what Arthur is doing to himself, their son and their marriage.  Finally having endured enough of Arthur's abuse and fearing for the safety and well being of her son, she, her maid and son make a mad dash to freedom and arrive at Wildfell Hall, where she assumes the dress of a widow to stay in hiding.  By the time Gilbert understands all that Helen has been through, Arthur has discovered where she is and brought her and their son back to their home.  There Helen stays, being faithful as always to her husband, and taking a stand against his abuse and infidelity.  Arthur is now gravely ill from years of alcohol and debauchery and Helen fires the governess, who was also an enabler to Arthur's alcoholism.  One of Arthur's friend's tries to put the moves on Helen, but she rebuffs him, telling him she made a promise to her husband to be faithful and for the man to never come back again. Gilbert comes to rescue her, telling her she is too good for her husband, but Helen is an honest, righteous woman, and though she cares for Gilbert, she can not, nor will not, cheat on her husband.  Eventually Arthur dies and Helen and her son return to Wildfell Hall.  ****SPOILER ALERT****  On the way to the hall, they spot a wedding reception going on in town and Helen sees Gilbert talking and laughing with a bride.  She assumes Gilbert got tired of waiting for her and married, and is saddened by this.  Gilbert is told by one of the guests at the reception that they saw Helen ride by in her coach.  He rushes off to see her and asks about her husband.  She tells him he has died and tells Gilbert congratulations on his wedding.  He explains that it wasn't he who got married but someone else.  So now these two, who have been growing in love, can now be free to be married.  I've watched this movie SO many times and I just love it.who was also an enabler to Arthur's alcoholism.

B00133KFGW|4.0|OK, I fell for it hook, line, and sinker. This is a lovely film, even though it comes perilously close to becoming \\"precious.\\" The cast is excellent -- Freddie Highmore continues to charm, and I hope he changes his mind about not continuing his acting career into adulthood. He is very, very good. As with most films these days, it could have been edited a little tighter, but otherwise -- let your cynicism go and enjoy.
0060989157|4.0|All you ever wanted to know (and maybe some stuff you probably didn't need to) in an account given by the band itself and a few other insiders.  A frank look into the lives of one of the most decadent bands in history. Impossible to put down.
B000X1N440|5.0|Yes, that's right, 5 Stars for a book about proper punctuation. I fully expected to get through this book only for my 2008 Challenges. In my mind's eye I saw myself reading a page or two and then falling sound asleep from boredom. I could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />Not only does Lynne Truss make punctuation interesting, she makes it funny. She knows just were little punctuation puns fit. Who knew there were 17 proper uses for the apostrophe?! There was, at onetime, a movement to have a special mark to indicate a rhetorical question. As is stated on the front flap, \\"Through sloppy usage and low standards on the Internet, in e-mail, and now \\"txt msgs\\", we have made proper punctuation an endangered species.\\" (not to mention proper spelling)<br /><br />I've given this book 5 Stars not only because I enjoyed it, but because I think all of us who have been out of the classroom for 10 years or more could use a refresher.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|Teeny tiny pseudo-spoiler lies ahead. But only a small one.<br /><br />Having seen this sanguine production on stage, off Broadway, I can tell you, it never reached its full potential until it finally made it to film. Sweeney Todd, the motion picture, has great music, great sets, great performances, but a thin plot hampered by film's limitations when it comes to its powerful, abrupt ending. Only in its conclusion is Sweeney Todd better on stage, simply because on stage the \\"killing\\" of the lights and the fall of the curtain made for a more dramatic exit around the kneeling form of Todd than a screen simply fading to black. In Burton's hands I also found Todd more villainous than anti-heroic, and I'm not sure I liked it better that way. Johnny Depp, though, was wonderful, as he always is, as were Sacra Baron Cohen, Alan Rickman, and Helena Bonham Carter. Also, as imagined in Tim Burton's gloriously dark mind, the twisted alleyways of London have never looked so brooding, so filthy, so pregnant with violent menace. The only thing missing was a score by Burton's de rigueur partner in crime, Danny Elfman, but of course I understand his absence full well. Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is not perfect, few films are, but it is still a deft exercise in macabre good humor that delights the inner demon in all of us.
B000F8DB4O|5.0|I've played guitar professionally for 40 years, only barely like HARDCORE jazz, like mostly rock and I think that this CD is the best CD of all time. I think it beats Sgt Pepper, Led Zep II even Wes Montgomery.   There are two things that make Pat great. His songwriting (or someone's anyway) and his what appears to be extremely high degree of improvisational thought. This last thing accounts for his arhythmic playing (he plays many, many phrases which don't follow the beat, but are more like human speech verbal phrases which don't follow a beat either). This is the height of genius.   I also know that his album 'Still Life' is almost as good as this.   This man's good albums (he has some stinkers) are the best things ever recorded that I've ever heard. Period.
184195425X|4.0|Life of Pi  By Yann Martel  Knopf Canada    By ANDREW B.             Yann Martel tells of an interesting story that shows how a young boy can have the courage to face very difficult situations.  He gives you a glimpse of dealing with some very extraordinary circumstances.  He tries to show readers that life is very delicate and the will to live can outweigh extreme conditions.   Martel traveled the world and saw many places.  While he traveled he read stories of religion and castaways.  In 2001he wrote Life of Pi and was later accused of plagiarizing Moacryr Scliar's Max e os Felinos.  The accusations were dropped when Scliar did not pursue legal actions.      This book sucessfully shows the authors purpose.  A few tangents are present but Martel captures the main idea, life is fragile but the will to live is strong. He shows this in many ways, including on a boat with wild animals, landing on a deserted island, and overcomming starvation to reach saftey.  As a reader it feels like you are the one on the boat and it drives your mind to think outside the box.   The book is very discriptive and enjoyable to read, keeping you on the edge of your seat.  The unique layout keeps you wanting to read more, and sends your mind racing in another world.  However some sections are stretched-out making you wanting to skip to the next chapter.  Overall the book gives a great reality-check and is a very good book to read if you are looking for a good time.
B00154GEFU|4.0|It is truly a great thing to behold, as ASIA returns to form, It would seem that Wetton & Palmer's brush  with death (Each having open heart surgery) have marked this band for the better. The Lyrics of \\"NEVER AGAIN\\" and \\"An Extraordinary Life\\" reflect this<br /><br />This CD is well worth owning for \\"Any\\" ASIA fan (Wetton or Payne)<br /><br />Yet I think before we start burning burning bridges on the \\"Payne\\" camp we need to mention the \\"GPS\\" project (which I think is the direction John Payne needs to continue with) \\"Window to the Soul\\" is frankly John Paynes best effort to date & should not be slighted, however to call the band \\"ASIA: Featuring John Payne\\" is a bit confusing to new fans of both bands, who may not know of the history behind the music.<br /><br />I have \\"Phoenix\\" and love it, I do agree that it sits somewhere between \\"ASIA\\" & \\"ALPHA\\" but well worth owning. 4 out of 5 stars to be sure
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Until I went to see this movie, I had never before witnessed half of a theater audience getting motion sickness from a film. Unfortunately I have now. I have to say this is the worst film I have EVER seen. For those who thought that Battlefield Earth was the worst movie in history, after you experience this film you will change your opinion. It is terrible.
B000M341QE|5.0|Movies don't get much quicker than this head-spinner. If you know the Whitey Bulger story from South Boston, you'll enjoy Jack Nicholson's twists. After you watch this, most other movies will seem slow and dull by comparison. Great soundtrack, as usual, for Scorcese, a music lover. But how many times can he recycle \\"Gimme Shelter\\"? The cat and mouse game at the movie's center is riveting, if silly. And the fake Boston accents by all except Mark Wahlberg, whose accent is real, will make you cringe if you're really from Boston. Even so, this one is a keeper.
0596007124|5.0|The promise they make on the preface of the book is true. The knowledge really sticks to your brain, part due to the examples and part due to the language the authors use along the text. Just one thing to record, the authors were too humble declaring it can't be considered a reference guide, yes it is, although fun, the book is an excelent reference guide.
B000002NG7|4.0|I am especially fond of this Albumn, not only because it's \\"album of the year\\", but has a dark pressence that creeps in and stays throughout the whole cd.. which I think is different from their earlier work.  Something about it is murky and mysterious, but I like it!  Favorite track definitley \\"Stripsearch\\".. It's the sexy side of Mike Patton at his best..<br /><br />yay!
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I never read the novel so I can't compare the movie to the book. I enjoyed Omega Man with Heston immensely. I thought this movie stood up well to previous movie. The movie started well. New York City never looked so desolate and it felt real. Will Smith was in a tough role and he carried it off well. Smith had the almost the first half of the entire movie focused on him. No one to talk to except a dog. He does an amazing job of engaging the audience. The relationship with the dog was great. The dog deserved the academy award. The death of the dog scene was truly horrifying.     The main problem with the movie was that the ending was rushed. Once the dog died, the movie quickly jumped to the final act. As if the director knew where he wanted to go, but did not know how to get there. Another problem is that the zombies were poorly done.     In conclusion, thanks to Will Smith I enjoyed the movie. The beginning was great. The middle seemed rushed. The ending was good, but strange.
B00008438V|5.0|This movie has all the essentials of a great teen comedy: a hot model(Kelly LeBrock), a bully older brother (Bill Paxton), a guy with three names(this one has two, Ilan Mitchell-Smith and Anthony Micheal Hall)and it's directed by John Hughes. Wierd science is a must have for anyone interested in a movie of this genre.
0618918248|1.0|Any true scientist would know that science actually proves there is a God.  The two are not mutually exclusive, but very intertwined.  The whole universe is balanced on a razor's edge.  There is no way that anyone can look at the world and think to themselves that there is no God.  The truth is inscribed on the heart of every man.  We all know that God exists and that we were created to Worship Him.  The fact that Dawkins is so adamant, there are so many reviews, and this is a bestselling book is evidence that atheists are rebelling against something that most people already know to be true.  Ninety-percent of the people that have ever walked this planet have believed in a god, how can one mere atheist tell the rest of us that we are wrong?  I don't agree, but I understand.  Because before I became a Christian, I also used to wonder if there was a God.  Hindsight is 20/20, I knew deep down that He existed all along.  Now I serve Him with everything I have.  Don't discount the Lord until you have experienced Him for yourself.  Like the saying says: \\"Try Jesus, if  you don't like Him, the devil will always take you back.\\"  I love you with the love of the Lord.  And will be praying for your salvation.  In Jesus' name.  Amen.
B000EXDS5M|4.0|This is an excellent movie that stars a young Paul Newman and Robert Redford.  The movie features good dialogue and action sequences.  This is not a typical Clint Eastwood shoot-em up western, but a good natured, fast paced adventure.  A movie that can be shared with the family.

The package include a redeem code for the Xbox360 that expired the 31.december.2007, therefore you cannot enjoy the Animatrix like the people before you did :(    The HD-material is great, quality of Reloaded and Revolutions are quite better than the first. But hey, the first movie is the best ;)    Sound-vice the TrueHD does play its part, and you should really enjoy this at a high volume so your next door neighbor does not bother you.     Almost 5 of 5 for me; drawback is grainy \\"filter\\" on the first movie and that Animatrix code did not work.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I've been a fan of Richard Matheson's 'I Am Legend' for many years.  It's not a story that fits with popular film canons, it REALLY isn't. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone, but suffice it to say, the novelty of the ending works great on the page, but would probably have people storming the box office to get their money back as a film.<br /><br />But every so often, seemingly about every 20 years, it gets made into a movie, anyway.<br /><br />So what can you take from the book that WORKS?  The desolation of a lone survivor in a great empty city.. the eerie beauty of that kindof place and what that life would be.<br /><br />For this viewer this film nailed it.  No, it's not a slugfest, an action-packed thrillride.. No, Will Smith is not chewing a cigar and firing off one-liners to no-one for 2 hours (thank goodness- one can only imagine how this film would have played like with Arnold Schwarzeneggar, the original choice for the lead).<br /><br />So, what it IS is a stoic, QUIET observation of one person and a dog against a vividly empty Manhattan.  I say vividly because the CGI erasure of people used in this film is one the nicest understated effects I've seen used in a sci-fi film in many a year.<br /><br />The vampires of the original story have been given a reasonable (if predictable) update, and CGI is used extensively to give them a jumpy, feral quality.  If CGI makes them less believable, it at least succeeds in making them very unhuman, and the de-evolution aspect of these creatures makes this vision more isolating (and genuinely sad) than perhaps it should be.<br /><br />Will Smith knocked me out in this film.  It's nothing more than a meditation on remaining hopeful and holding together, and he evokes a big range of emotion with hardly a word.  No higher praise.<br /><br />As a sci-fi enthusiast, I'd give it 5 stars, but there's no way to resolve the ending of this story.  The original ending is an ironic slap in the face to the reader, the Omega Man nails Heston/Jesus to a cross, and this film tries to find a hopeful middle ground, but it just doesn't satisfy... to their credit they had an alternate ending that gives the story a stronger humanist slant, and it's interesting, but even less satisfying than the one they chose to use.<br /><br />**EDIT** (I take my last comment back------I have since seen the blu-ray release with the alternate ending intact and feel it's a much better film, a better character study, and a better resolution.. though it raises more questions about Neville's motives for finding a cure that fall outside of the simple hero story)<br /><br />So, yes, it flops in the last 3 minutes, but it's the journey thru that stark beautiful city that you hope we don't live to see that makes it worth it.nails Heston/Jesus to a cross, and this film tries to find a hopeful middle ground, but it just doesn't satisfy... to their credit they had an alternate ending that gives the story a stronger humanist slant, and it's interesting, but even less satisfying than the one they chose to use.<br /><br />**EDIT** (I take my last comment back------I have since seen the blu-ray release with the alternate ending intact and feel it's a much better film, a better character study, and a better resolution.. though it raises more questions about Neville's motives for finding a cure that fall outside of the simple hero story)<br /><br />So, yes, it flops in the last 3 minutes, but it's the journey thru that stark beautiful city that you hope we don't live to see that makes it worth it.

On stage along with Alfa Anderson and Luci Martin and Tony Thompson.I think you will agree that this current version of Chic is good.But doesn't begin to create the magic of the original group.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Seems like some people may have been put off by certain aspects of the story or dialogue, but I was not, I thought the movie was electric, edgy, and heartfelt throughout.  I enjoyed being challenged by the rapid teen dialogue and the incredibly rich and swift pace of the film.  I loved how they explained her mother's role in her life as \\"she sends me cacti\\", that was an excellent summation of that whole relation.  Brillant bits like that instantly explained peripheral details while keeping the focus on the stories main characters.  A story that was ultimately highly hopeful as a teen (ok, so it was an uber-teen) navigates thru life.

0307387178|5.0|This book occurs at an interesting intersection. It is first and foremost the tragic story of an idealistic young man. However, intertwined in the main story are various autobiographical notes from Jon Krakauer, which parallel the narrative quite neatly. There are also many anecdotes and vignettes from explorers and writers who have encountered the vast adventures of the wilderness. The wealth of quotes scattered throughout the chapters serves as a fitting ornament to the book. It is fitting that the biography of such a complex young man is filled with such complexities itself.
B00003CWTI|5.0|&quot;Magnolia&quot; is the kind of film I instinctively respond to. Leave logic at the door. Do not expect subdued taste and restraint, but instead a kind of operatic ecstasy. At three hours it is even operatic in length, as its themes unfold, its characters strive against the dying of the light, and the great wheel of chance rolls on toward them.&quot; Roger Ebert<br /><br />Eleven people caught in LA who's lives intertwine during the film. A film of such magnitude that I had to stop and try to put pieces together. I have seen this film three times and each time am struck by the brilliance of director, Paul Anderson.  How did he keep all of these characters in place and put together?<br /><br />One life runs into another and another. Great performances all.  Need, love, humanness, forgiveness, anger, hate, joy, are all brought to the fore within these characters.  Tom Cruise in one of his best performances as the crude Frank- 'The Cock Has It'. Jason Robards as the drying man so loved and hated. Julianne Moore as his young wife, hooked on drugs and trying to find her place in life. Philip Seymour has the nurse who loves his patient and tries to do all he can to fulfill their last wishes. John C Riley, as the cop trying to find love and truth .  William Macy as the child prodigy quiz kid who never grows up. Phillip Baker Hall as the TV quiz master who has cheated and lied and wants forgiveness as he is dying. Their are other connections, the young quiz kid who wants his father to be nicer to him. The father who wants his kid to bring him fame and fortune. The young woman hooked on cocaine trying to forget her life. All of these lives come together and in the final minutes of the film the skies open up and all have their lives in front of them.<br /><br />&quot;Magnolia&quot;makes it three-for-three for writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson, 29, who follows Hard Eight and Boogie Nights with his most ardent and ambitious movie yet. Anderson keeps a tight lid on his work so that audiences can approach his character-based dramas with a sense of discovery. Fair enough.

B000XYEJ0U|4.0|After being a fan of Epictetus for a few years, I decided I wanted to expand my Stoic philosopher experiences. I chose to read Marcus Aurelius' \\"Meditations,\\" and quickly discovered that this classic book has many different versions. In all honesty, I am not sure that I picked the best version.     While I certainly felt that this version was a good read, I would be hard-pressed to call \\"Meditations\\" a `classic' just based on this version. I struggled to give this version a 4-star rating, but did so out of the overall value of the thoughts and wisdom of Marcus Aurelius. If you want to read a true Stoic's personal insights on and observations of life, death, integrity, goodness, and happiness, then you cannot go wrong with this version of \\"Meditations.\\"    What I did not like about this book was that I found it very wordy and repetitive. From the perspective of being a man's personal recollections, it may have been a very accurate and literal translation, but from a reader's perspective, I would have much preferred a more coherent and organized collection of Marcus Aurelius' maxims and musings. Out of respect for the accomplishments and reputation of Marcus Aurelius, I am compelled to read other versions of \\"Meditations\\" to see which version I like best.  (This review is about a previous \\"Penguin Classics\\" version translated by Maxwell Staniforth)

B000UBMSB8|5.0|I purchased the Four Disk regular DVD version.  The image quality and sound quality is excellent, especially for a movie that is multiple decades old.  Disk One is the new director's edition.  This disk contains three comentary tracks. The director  is on one; several screenwriters are on track two; they discuss how the screenplay went from the book through several good and bad rewrites; the final commentary is by several of the special effects workers.  I sampled a little of each, and it was quite interesting.  Disk Two is a documentary on making the Blade Runner. Disk Three contains the three previous versions:the original American and international cuts, and the one previous directors cut. Each of these has the same great picture quality as the new cut.  However, my version(U.S.) had no alternate language (english only and no commentary) on these archive cuts although the new cut does.  Final disk has several short features that seem to concentrate on Philip Dick's writings.  I sampled a couple, and they seemed really interesting.    I am not a Blade Runner fanatic, but I always enjoyed the movie since seeing it at the college union several years after the original movie release.  I thought this new cut does provide the best version. I sampled part of the original version and liked this one much better without the narration by H.Ford. I really enjoyed this collection. Amazon has a great price. I payed a little more when I picked it up at one of the big box stores in February 08.  The four disk version was well packaged also.  Its size is compact as it is only slighter bigger than an individually packaged DVD.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This is the album that started my love affair with old time, bluegrass, american roots and folk music. An excellent place to start and a must for the music library. There is only one tune I don't particularly care for but when in the mood I'll still give it a listen...Buy it.
0553381407|5.0|Wow.  I devoured this book.  I found it riveting, fascinating, absorbing - I couldn't put it down.  I am intrigued by books that help me understand how people work.  Why does my friend have these emotional issues?  How has a troubled relationship with her father affected the rest of her life?  This book does an amazing job of explaining the psychology of those questions.  Plus, it was an enjoyable read.  Usually books like this have a tendency to go over the head of the average person.  But this was written in an easy writing style.  I laughed and cried with the people who were featured as cases.

B000EOTAM6|4.0|Speaking as a viewer who in his past has seriously seen only one episode of the MTV Aeon Flux show, I was hesitant to watch a movie based off the source material. I never understood nor nor appreciated the original content.     Curiosity took ahold of me though when this movie came to DVD and I ended up enjoying it very much. I liked the cool color palette, the sensual nature of organic technology and the innovative methods of weaponry.     The story, though not entirely original, was entertaining and at times thought-pprovoking. I ended up enjoying it. And it's in the truth of this that I discover why many didn't like the movie. As a fan of the show Bewitched, I was devastated by what was done to the movie to follow it. The same I guess for this movie. Fans of the show have a generally disdainful view of this movie. If you have minimal prior knowledge of that which is Aeon Flux, you may be a good candidate for liking the movie, like me.

B00132D808|2.0|Doesn't sound like older P!ATD. You should give this a listen before you buy it thinking that it will be the same fast pop laden tunes as \\"A Fever...\\". The fact that Nine in the Afternoon was the first single of the album will undoubtedly lead a lot of people astray, as it is the only song on this album even closely resembling the older sound. Some people will argue that it is a more \\"mature\\" sound, but I would rather refer to it as \\"slow\\", \\"obnoxious\\", \\"disappointing\\", and most of all \\"pretty odd\\".     Some people may still get some enjoyment out of this but I think fans of the older album should give a good listen to see if this new sound works for them... it didn't for me.
B00005ASOI|3.0|So after much build up and reading great reviews I finally bought Susperia on dvd having never watched the movie before. The dvd quality is fine and I'd recommend this movie to any Susperia fan. My complaints are witht he movie itself. After the promising graphic and gory murder scene at the beginning of the movie, it tends to drag and falls into a slow lumbering pace (i.e. boring). There are a few more thrills like the person getting caught in the barbed wire scene but overal the movie was kinda lack-luster. I can see why it gets credits for its artistic style, but I was dispointed in the movie. Maybe it seemed a lot scarier and better when originally viewed in 1977 you might say...true but I still get scared watching \\"Halloween\\" and that came out in 1978 and Ive seen it over 100 times. I doubt Susperia will spend anywhere near that much time in my dvd player. That being said I do plan to watch it again just to see if I \\"get it\\" this time...better take a few No-Dozes first!   Enjoy!    Paul

B0000048CP|1.0|I feel bad leaving a one-star review for an album that really is great, but I have to echo the previous commenter about the poor quality of the Kraze Records album available here on Amazon. The production quality of this cd is extremely low: bad sound, poorly scanned art, no album information, etc. The sound is really inexcusable. I hope no other metal fan buys this album from Kraze. The albums available from Black Mark are the way to go. Bottom line: great album, but this version is the pits.
0060578793|5.0|This is a nice book for everything from scouting trips to real life survival situations.
0679746323|4.0|Like the style of this book or not, people have to take its content seriously. I went through many books on China in Barnes & Noble, not one (except this one) ever delves into anything remotely related to the unimaginable horrors Mao unleashed in China. In these other books, it's always a general summary of the anti-this or anti-that campaigns as if all Mao did was playing politics. Wake up! Mao's brand of politics is nothing like what is practised here in America. Most of the academics in America appear incapable of understanding the sheer magnitude of evil a human being like Mao can commit and often admire his \\"political skills\\". Mao's brand of politics was played with the lives of millions upon millions of fellow Chinese.  It' a politics (if it should even be considered politics) of class elimination through terror and lies! He is a master of divide and conquer, but when he conquered, anyone (millions upon millions) in his way lost their lives. He conquered not just in war times (against fellow Chinese), but more so in peace times! He conquered not just his enemies, but anyone with a few bucks or read a few books or have some relatives outside China or former comrades! They died like stray dogs or barely survided like slaves. Mao set China back by at least half a century and even today his brand of politis has poisoned the minds of the whole country! For Americans in particular, Mao costed the lives of probably about 50,000 Americans in Korea and Vietnam, as a payback for what America did for China in WWII, which is essentially a war defending China against Japan. America has to regret not supporting Chiang Kai-shek's fight against the communists!  We human beings are sandwitched between God and Satan, but among the tens of billions of souls ever inhabited this earth, very few are closer to Satan than Mao. One can even build a strong case that Mao is closer to Satan than even Hitler and Stalin!  Beyond belief? Yes, but it's true.

0684803356|3.0|this book is a drunkolgue. of course, it's very well written. the style, is a style of a superb journalist. but the characters' alcoholism is piercing. the choices they make are hardly romantic, rather they are tragic. the emptiness of the spirit hidden behind the spirit of alcohol pierces through. how so many mice and men have fashioned their lives after this novel puzzles me.
B000056NX5|1.0|I can think of one good thing about this production; it's the the feeling you get when it's over and you don't have to see it again.    Onto the bad things. Jerome Pradon spends the whole thing trying to sing out of his range, and squealing like a fool in the process. It's *awful*. Granted, as English isn't his first language I could go easy on him for sounding slightly mental, but there is no excuse for selecting such an inadequate singer for the role of Judas.  Glenn Carter's smug, \\"Love me\\" expression is not appropriate. It's not appropriate for someone even remotely related to an all-knowing God, and it's certainly not appropriate for someone with such a weak voice.  Rik Mayall is utterly embarrassing as Herod. The U-Boat captain that they cast as Pilate is equally as baffling. The funniest moment in his scenes would be where he's supposed to sing : \\"You innocent puppet\\", and ends up singing \\"You innocent Papayat\\".   If anyone knows what a papayat is, please e-mail me.    The rest of the cast is really too mediocre to bother with. Annas was amusing, I'll say that much.    This production was directed (obviously) by someone with a severe lack of understanding with regards to what made the 1973 film so awesome. They took away all of the human moments, and the subtelty, and turned it into a cartoon. With crap singing.  They deleted songs that might imply that Caiaphas and Annas were just doing 'what they thought was right for their country' and instead turned them into virtually moustache-twirling villains.    This DVD is aimed at the 30-50 IQ demographic. Steer clear of this if you like good music, played good.
B00005JPFH|3.0|The strengths of the first two \\"Spider-Man\\" films are what you'd expect from Sam Raimi - insane action with moments (and many of them) of characterization.  With all of the action, you never feel rushed or short-changed, which made his films sorta the \\"thinking man's action movies.\\"    The same could be said for Tim Burton's take on Batman in his first go-around with the character.  Unfortunately, he fell on his face cramming two brilliant villains in one movie making for a much malaigned hurried pace that ruined what could've been two good movies.  The lesson here is obvious - too many things can simply add up to too many things.    I had to think long and hard, obviously, about \\"Spider-Man 3.\\"  (It took me THIS long to fairly write a review!)  Because there's a lot to like - I'm not being sarcastic here - yet there's simply too much jammed into the movie.  I'm stating the obvious, seeing what other people wrote, but when you really want to love a movie and see it just coming in slightly above average, one hopes the criticisms will add up, thus keeping producers, studio heads, et.al., from being too \\"commercially ambitious.\\"    Attacking the thinness and rushed pace is easy.  Mentioning that it's a disappointment when you expected more is a given.  Instead, let's look at what makes us love this movie, warts and all.  There are still moments of characterization here that makes it more deep than a simple summer popcorn movie.  For example, the complicated relationship between Peter (Tobey Maguire) and the important people in his life.  Harry (James Franco, much underrated) and MJ (Kirsten Dunst, more than just a pretty face)get a lot of screen time here and none of it is wasted.  Harry blaming Peter for Norman's death isn't repetitive, it's refreshed anew by bringing in the traumatic amnesia that plagued the Goblin characters in the comic book (a good, not overstated, nod to comic continuity).  Harry's ultimate fate has that much more poignancy when it's played out because of this.    The shoe being on the other foot in Peter's relationship with MJ was also a tad interesting, because it complicates things and that's always good for a romance that will be played out in a franchise.  It also tends to display how different Peter and MJ are - when Peter's life is going down the tubes, he internalizes it.  MJ however lashes out at Peter whan she loses her role on Broadway.  Thus the issue arises - IS MJ \\"perfect?\\"  Nope.  She can be self-centered too.    A conflicted villain is also interesting, which is why I rather liked Thomas Hayden Church's Flint Marko/Sandman.  We see a guy just trying to make money to save his daughter.  Being made into a silicon-based lifeform adds just enough of the spice to make him tough and tender.  He may be a crook, but he's being a crook (now) for the right reasons.  That they didn't split up the villains for two movies - giving both of them their due - is more of the shame looking at Church's take on Sandman.    Topher Grace also deserved more as he was giving a good sociopathic charm to Eddie Brock BEFORE he became Venom.  At first, he's merely Peter's cheerfully obnoxious rival at the Daily Bugle.  However, we see hints of his delusional nature with how he inflates a \\"coffee\\" with Gwen Stacy (sorry I can't remember the actress' name right now, and that's another issue with too much in here - the new people don't have much time to shine) into a \\"fantastic night.\\"  But the problem here is HIS story is a bit too rushed.  Wasn't it possible to have just the Symbiotic Thing that Venom becomes with Eddie play an (interestingly) understated villain in making Peter \\"bad\\" in this movie, paving the way for an expanded, and thus much better, fourth movie?    Ah, but I'm being drawn into the negatives again.  While we're on that subject, I certainly hope there wasn't a real effort to rewrite Uncle Ben's death.  I hope not - Flint's flashback of the evening is left, I think deliberately vague, - because it'd bereally too weak.    The point overall is that \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is rather entertaining and really worth the buying.  But oh, what could've been.....

0307277887|5.0|Alright heres the deal.  Darkly Dreaming Dexter follows a Blood spatter expert for the Miami Police department but during the night he is not your friendly co worker you see every day, he's a serial killer with a set of rules called \\"the code of harry\\".  The book follows dexter to hunt a serial killer that is killing hookers.  Darkly Dreaming Dexter is one of the books in this world that will scare you and also delight you at the same time.  Dexter only kills bad people.  If you have seen the show Dexter on showtime you are missing so much.  The book has the same characters but a completely diffrent setting  and the ending of season 1 in dexter and the end of Darkly Dreaming Dexter are so different.  If you like crime fiction and horror stories THIS IS THE ONE TOO BUY!  One of the best books I have ever read.

B00005JLWN|5.0|A stylish action film with real actors.  Christian Bale's action sequences here are probably what got him the role of Batman.  This film is unfortunately compared to the Matrix too often, when it stands on it's own.  The movie contain much of the story line from Fahrenheit 451 and overtones of A Brave New World.  A futuristic glimpse at tyranny, a nod to classic literature, good actors, and a good action director make this film well worth seeing.  One of my favorites.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|Perhaps the most underrated film ever made. Barry Lyndon is one the most beautifully crafted films in any genre. The film is set in the 18th century, the Age of Reason. But personal feelings and motivations seeped up through the rationalist surface of that time. Barry Lyndon, more than any other film, captures the essence of the 18th century. The costumes, cinematograghy, and settings are all beautiful. Ryan O'Neal, who plays Barry Lyndon, is quite good in the title role. Some have commented that this Stanley Kubrick's most boring film. Actually, important and interesting things happen in every scene.  There's too many events, surprises, and turns in this film to write about them here, which would ruin it for a first time viewer anyway. Barry Lyndon is an Irish scoundrel who is determined to climb up the ladder of the strict British class system. He's not a perfect scoundrel and gets caught off guard several times in the film. The film has a subtle sense of humor like the duel between Barry and the fearful Capt. Quinn. The seduction of Lady Lyndon by Barry in and outside of a gaming room is wonderfully done. There's no dialogue in that scene at all, but if there was it wouldn't have been as effective. Bryan's (Barry's son) deathbed and funeral scenes accompanied by Sarabande music are powerful. When Barry was in the Royal Army he got into a fistfight with another soldier. His opponet was bigger and had the brut strength that Barry didn't have. But Barry was more cunning and quicker so he won the fight. The scene says a lot about the character and the plot. There's a lot more but you really have to see it for yourself.
B0011FXLCC|4.0|Listening to Seventh Tree leaves behind a certain kind of calm, the type you probably wouldn't find in Supernature, their last discoball effort. From the  haunting first single A&E that talks of suicide resonates on many levels. Continued listens of Tree reveal a more basal Goldfrapp stripped of the multi-layered colouring of their last effort, moving them a bit closer to Felt Mountain but not quite. The atmospheric Clowns with its melodious guitar strums open the album, suggesting a facet that withholds a melancholic interior. Most songs border on sounding depressing. Caravan Girl comes the closest to being a mood lifter. Though it may take some adjusting to a less gaudy Goldfrapp, they are never far from being best. (B+)

B0012KOCN8|1.0|This is sad. I have ordered five Opus Arte HD DVD discs relating to opera and ballet; three play very well (\\"Swan Lake\\", \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\", and \\"Die Zauberflote\\"--excuse the lack of umlaut. Two would not play: \\"Die Fledermaus\\" (since withdrawn) and now \\"Il trovatore\\". My Toshiba A3 and A30 both produce the error message: Cannot Play the Disc/Error Code: 408bcOOd. My LG BH200 lets the disc get past the copyright warning and then continues to play a one minute loop in which the camera pans across a line of canons in a red mist. There is no audio and there is no button that will break the disc out of this loop. No menu displays. Needless to say, this is VERY disappointing; I've been looking forward to this disc for months. I see Opus Arte is releasing La Boheme at the end of April. I was ready to order it, but I'll wait until I see a review that says people can play it. By rights, this disc should have zero stars. Naturally I'll be returning it to Amazon for a refund.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|I went to see this movie because it had such great reviews. It started off really slow and continued to move at that pace. You'd think it was about to get scary or exciting because the scratchy high pitched music would get louder and louder. But no, there was no actual build up to anything at all. The plot could only very loosely be called a \\"plot\\". There was no point. There was no moral. There was only a rambly story that meant nothing. When it was over, my friend and I couldn't move because we just couldn't believe that we watched the whole horrible thing. We actually started laughing because there was almost nothing at all to say. We were just in shock. I was then banned by my friend from picking out a movie ever again.
1592289444|2.0|I bought this book with great anticipation, having read and enjoyed other survival tales such as \\"Endurance\\" and \\"In the Heart of the Sea.\\"  I've been slogging through the uninspired language for the past month with great difficulty.  The lack of passion Rawicz brings to his writing is perhaps a clue that this is not a true story, as some have attested.  Or maybe it's a problem with the translation.  Either way, I don't find this to be the gripping tale it could have been.    I should add that I have been reading this under the assumption that it was true.  So discovering now that it may not be true has not in any way affected my review; I thought it was boring before then.  I wish I had known about the controversy and had picked a different book.  Other reviewers have stated that it is an exciting and remarkable story, true or not. I disagree.  If it is true it is a dull and lifeless transcription of a remarkable feat.  If it is fiction than the author has not only lied but written a boring book.

She is also telling a fictional story based of the story of a girl that got raped and killed by the same man who raped Alice Seabold during her freshman year of college.   The author of The Lovely Bones lived though her horrible experience and is now married to author Glen David Gold. After being raped Alice went through difficult times with drugs and court battles. These horrific experiences that no one should ever have to endure motivated her to write about a rape that did not turn out as lucky as hers did. Today, Alice lives a close to normal life with her husband trying to forget about the unhappy memories that haunt her.  Even though the book is dark and not the happiest story ever written, Alice Seabold gets her message across clearly. She does this by letting Suzie Salmon, the girl that was raped, tell her story from heaven. In heaven Suzie watches her family and friends wonder and deal with her death. Suzie watches her family fall apart right before her eyes. Many victim's families have a hard time dealing with the question, Why her?   Many times in the book there is very detailed descriptions of people Suzie knew and now knows in heaven. If a person who likes having a picture painted in their mind down to the very last detail read this book they would love it. It paints mental images very well because the great detail. To other people who are looking for action every second, they may be bored for a little while. This is until the action comes. This book portrays a wonderful courageous story of a perfectly normal girl that had her life taken from her in a matter of minutes.

B00026WU64|5.0|It took quite a long time - much longer than most albums, actually - for this to make its mark on me. But now that it has, I can safely endorse its mythic reputation. It's marred the slightest bit by some ponderous philosophy (\\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\"), and while some lyrics from \\"I Shall be Free\\" are priceless, the many explicit references to '60s pop culture date the song. Still, there's a lot to like, even to love, about this one. The mood of the album varies from humorous but thought-provoking satire (\\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\"; \\"Talkin' World War Three Blues\\") to love songs (the delicate, finger-picked \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\", the mournful \\"Girl of the North Country\\"). There are only two covers this time around, and they're both well-done: \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" (with brushed drums) is heartbroken, and \\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\\" is engaging and fun. The most hard-hitting protest by far is \\"It's a Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\", with bone-chilling apocalyptic imagery sung in a Biblical tone, though the biting \\"Masters of War\\" and dead-on anti-racism \\"Oxford Town\\" take home high honors as well. And even the generic blues \\"Down the Highway\\" is boosted by Bob's desolate delivery. I haven't even mentioned the record's most famous track, the Zen-like human rights anthem \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" - needless to say, it's a masterpiece, and one of the best songs in Dylan's entire career. The acoustic guitar and harmonica backdrop might seem a bit repetitive at first, but it's ample support for the words and vocals. The lyrics are, of course, as good as you've heard, and while Dylan's vocals aren't great from a technical standpoint, they certainly are from an emotional one. I know this is a clich&eacute;, but if you must have one acoustic guitar, harmonica, and vocals album, make it this one. You will not regret it.

160459201X|5.0|I was interested in learning more about the subconscious mind from a creative standpoint.  As a visual artist, I've always wanted to discover a way to really tap into the infinite wealth of creative possibility that I am convinced lies deep within all of us.  I stumbled across this book in a search on Amazon.  What a powerful book with powerful ideas, and even more that I expected based on the title.  I've been carefully studying this book for a few weeks, trying to absorb all of the lessons.  I feel certain I can read it over and over and find something new and profound each time.  I've really enjoyed other sources with similar lessons, including the Secret, The Success Principles, The Science of Success, Maximum Achievement, etc..  Nevertheless, this book really spoke to me on another level.  I'm not certain if this is due to Murphy's writing style and perspective, or if my understanding of the concepts has deepened on its own through continuous study and contemplation.  I already recommended the book to a friend and he has also found the material fascinating and helpful.  If you are interested in discovering the laws of mind for yourself as well as realizing the power of your mind to direct the course of your life as you see fit (in all areas), I would fervently recommend this book to you.  There are many great affirmations and stories about people who were able to shift their mindsets, subsequently changing their lives for the better.

1400063515|3.0|I became interested in this book after reading a review in the Wall Street Journal.  Unfortunately, I had a very difficult time slogging through to the end.  NNT should have stuck to his \\"day job\\" as a trader or hired a ghost writer, since he seems to have great difficulty in stringing together a coherent set of thoughts in prose.  As one reviewer has noted, a 10-page article written by an accomplished journalist would probably have sufficed to communicate the key themes of the book.  HOWEVER - I give the book 3 stars because of the subject material, which I deem to be thought provoking and worthy of further study.  Key points made in the book:  - Certain natural processes, such as the height to which we humans grow, are very well predicted by the normal, or Gaussian, distribution, in which the probability of extreme values is exceedingly low.  - As a consequence, and due to certain failings of human instinct, we attempt to apply the Gaussian distribution to all manner of domains to which it should not be applied, such as world affairs, finance, and investing.  - The result is a gross and dangerous underestimate of the risks from extreme events, the \\"unknown unknowns,\\" the \\"Black Swans.\\"  - What does that mean practically?  For one thing, for the individual investor it means that all those handy financial and retirement calculators that estimate your future investment results based on the average annual returns and standard deviations of various asset classes over the last 60 or so years are giving you a false sense of security.  In NNT's view, there is a very real possibility of a Black Swan event that swoops in and blows up your hard-earned portfolio.  Or in less dramatic terms, it means you may be eating dog food at age 70.  NNT pretty much leaves the reader to draw his or her own conclusions about the meaning of the Black Swan in their own affairs.  There is not much investing advice in the book - NNT made his money betting on Grey Swans - highly unlikely but predictable events - not Black Swans.  How do you place a bet on an event that cannot be foreseen?  The salvation of reading this book to the end was precisely that it made me think hard about what the Black Swan means to me as an individual investor.  My conclusion was that rather than modifying anything I am already doing, I needed to adopt a certain mindset.  I need to be mentally prepared for the fact that there is a very real possibility that some Black Swan event could occur in my lifetime that completely wipes out the portfolio I spent the last 27 years amassing.  If that happens, I don't want to find myself on a window ledge like many did in 1929.  With that in mind, I resolve to do the following:  - Diversify my portfolio (done)  - Own my home outright (10 years to go on a 15 year mortgage)  - Eschew debt (always have)  - Live below my means and keep saving something (check)  - Stay healthy (trying my best)  - If the dreaded Black Swan does happen, be mentally prepared, accept my fate, and move on.
B0010ZR160|4.0|Gone Baby Gone is a moody, atmospheric thriller set in Boston and starring Casey Affleck, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris and Michelle Monoghan. Oh, its also directed by Ben Affleck. Before you snicker and think of Gigli, I've got to tell you this is a good movie. Casey Affleck is fun to watch, and Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are always top notch. Michelle Monoghan is the only actor that seem's underused. From the first time I saw her, I thought she looked great as the gritty partner Angie Generro to Affleck's private investigator Patrick Kenzie. Yet it seems like they used the version of the script that had all her lines deleted. In most scenes she just stood there.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is based on a book written by Mystic River scribe Dennis Lehane. The book is great. I can't remember the exact details of the book, but I believe the movie has a different ending, one that is not as good as the book. In the movie, a young girl is kidnapped. Her aunt turns to Kenzie and Generro because she believes they can get people to talk to them that wouldn't talke to the police. That's true, and soon Kenzie has turned up some leads. Some leads work out and some don't and the ending leads to a perhaps a not so surprising twist.<br /><br />The great thing about this movie is the setting. The people and locations seem real. More importantly, the despair and desperation feel real. The mom of the kidnapped little girl obviousy cares nothing about her child, and horrible, selfish parenting of this mom is the theme of the movie. Kids can't choose their parents, yet the action of the parents often determine whether or not the child will lead a good life. This is a good movie. Watch the movie, read the book. You'll enjoy both.

B000002LMK|2.0|I don't know. I consider myself a pretty big Neil Young fan but this record is just plain boring. Nothing to really discerne one song from the next. Similar tempo throughout. Meandering guitar solos that really go nowhere. Truth is I might even like some of these songs if they were half as long. Disappointing in my opinion. Noy sure what all the hype is about on this one.

B000YKE87W|5.0|Like another reviewer, I bought this CD after reading the generally excellent review in Opera News.  And I wasn't disappointed.  If Pavarotti and Domingo are more silver and gold vocally, think of Kaufmann as a rich dark amber.  He has a lovely dark warmth to his voice, much like the late Richard Tauber (without Tauber's excessive vocal mannerisms.)  He does not have an open ringing Italianate top--in fact the top notes, although right on, are covered.<br /><br />  What he does have, besides a beautiful warm tone, is excellent musical artistry.  He breaks no ground in his musical selections, but gives a new and appealing interpretation to the music--more subtle and less bombastic.  Although he's good in the Italian and fine in the German repertoire, my personal favorites were the selections from French opera, which Kaufmann delivers with what I would call restrained passion.  (Sometimes less is more.)<br /><br />  The only misstep was a weird rendition of The Prize Song from Wagner's Die Meistersinger.  Despite the fact that he'd done a concert production of the opera to apparently great acclaim, he delivers Walther's big number almost diffidently, as if he were tossing off a little German folk song instead of singing his heart out to win the hand of the girl he loves from his detested rival.  Odd, and it doesn't work.  Other than that, however, he does just fine.<br /><br />  He gets excellent support from the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Marco Armiliato, and the sound quality is excellent.  I am very glad I bought this CD and am enjoying listening to it.
B000002MJC|4.0|this album was released in 1993, the height of grunge, where the styles of the 80's and all the wonders of synth pop were finally drowned out.

Here is where the band has finally incorporated a more organic sound to their music and guess what, IT WORKS!.  the first release \\"I Feel You\\" was a change of pace as a loud distorted guitaer kicks things off and many were surprised.<br /><br />in my own humble opinion Martin Gore probably has written some his strongest material.<br /><br />Many were expecting \\"Violator pt. 2\\" or something like that. had depeche mode done that, it would have been a let down and a major disrespect to their fans, as depeche mode have always progressed their sound on each album.<br /><br />stand out tracks are \\"I Feel you\\", \\"In Your Room\\" \\"Condemnation\\" \\"Get Right With Me\\", \\"Rush\\" and \\"One Caress\\"<br /><br />sadly the devotional tour would test the limits of the band as alan wilder left after the tour and dave gahan's struggles with heroin were in full swing.<br /><br />all in all this is a strong album and a must own for depeche mode fans.

B000W1TJWC|5.0|This is not only one of Rush's best albums, but one of the greatest progressive rock albums of all time. The mix & mastering are great, and the songwriting is incredibly creative. You can tell that these guys were really having fun and enjoying their creative work. This album also set the bar high for future works, some of which equal this album, but none surpass it.    Now for the songs:    FAREWELL: Intriguing opening with the classical guitar, great riffs into the verses, and a driving yet catchy chorus. Glad they included this on Chronicles and Different Stages.    XANADU: What can you say? This is the best song on the album, and perhaps their best song, period. It's certainly the best progressive rock song of all time, building from the soft nature setting to some of the best riffs and counter-melodies they've composed. Sparing use of keyboards accents the chorus parts perfectly. You really can't put it into words. It's an essential track for any prog-rock lover.    CLOSER TO THE HEART: Fun little song. Yes, overplayed, but for a reason -- it's great!    CINDERELLA MAN: A really driving song with a neat tempo-change in the chorus, and a really fun instrumental section before the second chorus. Rather experimental for Rush at the time, and they nailed it. Great song.    MADRIGAL: A love-ballad. Hard to tell if it was written to a woman, a homestead, or simply to a previous way of life (or all three!). Great change of pace.    CYGNUS X-1: The most incredible, not-to-be-believed song ever written by these guys. A space fantasy that really works musically (only these guys could have pulled this off so masterfully). The final vocals are so over-the-top, they actually work. Incredibly creative, fun, and never tiring to listen to again.    Progressive rock at its best -- easily 5+ stars.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Very cool action and special effects.  The movie's main concept makes for some very interesting, memorable scenes.<br />*Camermanship is very smooth, slick, and use some very cool colors.<br />*The storyline generally works.<br />*Characters are not bad.  Jessica Beil's character stands out very well; she is awesome.<br />*Good, original production design.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The ending!!! What happens next?! Are they going to make sequels or what?!<br />*Not sure if it's accurate to the original story (then again, every adaptation of PKD tends to be different for some odd reason...).<br /><br />I didn't expect much, but this film turned out to be very slick.  The action and effects are smashing, and jive really well with the central idea.  The whole movie is engaging, but not hyper or overdone.  The only bad weakness is the end (don't you just hate those endings when the main character wakes up and it turned out to be a dream? Ugh).  However, if they intend on making sequels, this would be a promising start.  I would gladly reccomend this to action or sci-fi fans.
B00005JPSM|3.0|I've seen better romantic comedies/chick flick then this one. This movie was billed as a romantic-comedy, but wasn't very comedic as it deals with death/loss/grief and other life issues. Overall this movie is predictable, which made it both boring and slow. Also, Catherine Zeta-Jones character is pretty flat and one dimensional.... I think there could have been more substance overall in the storyline to make this a better movie.
B000K15VSA|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Very good special effects, even to this day.<br />*Very strong, vivid imagery.  Excellent cameramanship.  Great, smooth, slick style (reminiscent of the film-noir genre).<br />*Excellent production value.  The sets are well-detailed.  The lighting is totally bizzare (in a good way).  The costumes are good and imaginative.  Much of it is interesting and artistic.<br />*Storyline is pretty straightforward, and leaves plenty of room for characters and themes.<br />*Characters are pretty neat.  I don't think they're extremely deep, but they are distinctive.  Much of the time, they leave you wondering who are the androids and who are the humans.<br />*Funky, imaginative music score.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Even though the basic story and characters are the same, there are many huge differences between this and the original book (\\"Do Anroids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" by Phillip K Dick; an awesome book!).  Could also be a good thing, because the filmmakers made it their own thing and came up with something original.<br />*It is a slower movie, based more on style and mood than on action.<br /><br />Film-noir joins forces with futuristic sci-fi to bring us a bleak but fantastic vision of the future.  With such great settings, strong imagery, and smashing special effects, it is easy to see why this film is such a classic.  It is very deep and artistic, and each new viewing presents something new to see or think about.  Some may consider it boring, but everybody should see it at least once.<br /><br />The two-disc special edition includes the final cut of the movie (which has no voice-over narrative, no happy ending, and many subtle changes), and the \\"Dangerous Days\\" documentary.  The four-disc version has these same two discs plus three other versions of the movie (the original theatrical cut, the international cut (with more violence), and the 1994 director's cut (which is much like the final cut)).  Disc four also has a number of additional featurettes and galleries.  The five-disc version includes the same four discs plus the workprint version of the movie (a rough cut, which is very different).the same four discs plus the workprint version of the movie (a rough cut, which is very different).
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I was raised on the Beatles and everything affiliated with them.  I loved the movie and I loved the soundtrack to no end.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|The Good Things<br />*Loads of slick special effects.<br />*Good cameramanship.<br />*Good production quality (good sets, costumes, designs, etc).<br />*Despite all the stereotypes and bad accents, the acting is passable.<br />*Storyline works and leaves much room for lots of upbeat adventure.<br />*There is a good number of nifty gadgets.<br />*Music is not bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The main monster characters are not very well developed, and conform more to their given stereotypes.  Dracula acts much like he did when Bella Lugosi played him.  Frankenstein is a total drama queen.  Wolfman is somewhat cool, but still shallow.<br />*The human characters are also not very well developed, and have incredibly hoaky accents.<br />*Van Helsing himself is a shallow Indiana Jones type character, and has very little to do with the original character from Bram Stoker's novel \\"Dracula.\\"<br />*Everything is extremely cheesy.<br /><br />The concept is corny in itself; a combination of the top three movie monsters (Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolfman) in one big brawling adventure.  As a story, it's mildly interesting.  The characters are very lacking, showing nothing beneath their cliched surfaces.  This film doesn't do any justice to the actors or the characters.  The best thing is simply the action and special effects.  It's simply better to turn your brain off, sit back, and enjoy the eye-candy.  Probably best viewed during Holloween.
B0010MTL8O|1.0|This was advertised as an SACD.  IT IS NOT.  It is simply a Japanese import CD.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Being past the age of the intended audience of this film, I have to say it's great.  I think it didn't get enough attention (especially for Joseph Gordon Levitt), and less critical praise than it deserved.  It's an intriguing murder mystery with false turns, and an ending that, while you were kind of expecting it, was beautifully done.  The film is appropriately sparse given that the main character is a teenage boy, and shot wonderfully.  Worth a view.
B00005RYL2|3.0|I remember Highlander from many years ago, always watching it from VHS.  Many memorable lines and scenes and all that great Queen soundtrack music.  Well it's many years later and the story is still there but like anything that's 20 years old, it shows it's age a little.  The fights seem tame to todays standards, but then again there is more to this movie than the fights.  Back then it was a 21\\" with VHS, today it's 91\\" with DVD.  Quite grainy and lacking, but again maybe an upconverter will help.  The price was right, but I probably was better off just renting.

B00006ADD5|5.0|The acting, music and cinematography of Lawrence of Arabia is absolutely brilliant. It's little wonder it was an award-winning film and remains a huge favourite. Unfortunately scriptwriters and directors sometimes take the liberty to distort historical accuracy for the sake of telling an adventurous tale about extraordinary people.<br /><br />Such is the case with Lawrence of Arabia. While the film does indeed follow the exploits of T.E. Lawrence in the Middle East during WWI, it must be noted that some characters are merely composites or fictional players used to create a story. Geographical details and events are contrived and sacrificed for the sake of storytelling. Even his brother, A.W. Lawrence on viewing the film in 1962 said, \\"I should not have recognised my brother.\\"<br /><br />Case in point, the words and actions of characters Dryden, Colonel Brighton, Sherif Ali and Jackson Bentley (not altogether Lowell Thomas) are constrained neither by historical fact nor specific plausibility; they are mere poetic license for screen writer Bolt's narrative more than anything else.<br /><br />The film suggests Lawrence was an oddity, exploited by the British and Emir Feisal for their political ends. In reality Lawrence was not the unwitting tool portrayed in the film. He had been closely involved in these issues as early as 1915. He probably had a more salient view than Allenby of British-Indian, French and Arab political objectives. In actual fact, Lawrence was a key adviser to Feisal, both during the Arab Revolt and at the Paris Peace Conference. Lawrence also devised a map of the Middle East demarcating separate countries for Armenians and the peoples of present-day Syria, Jordan and parts of Saudi Arabia in another state, based on tribal patterns and commercial routes; the map is presently on display at the Imperial War Museum in London.<br /><br />Another mistaken point in the film is that when Arab tribesmen went home with their spoils of war, Lawrence's Revolt afterwards operated under smaller Arab forces. This is not so. As the Revolt spread north, it took on tribal forces previously unused. The Hauran forces long known to be available, and finally called out in the last stages of the campaign, increased the Arab army to a far larger size.<br /><br />The film also projects the Arab Revolt as an meaningless victory. On the contrary, it had significant impact. The French and British Imperial Government in India feared its consequences would fan the flame of independence movements in the Middle East and elsewhere. With the British endorsement of the Revolt, it ushered in the respectability of nationalist rebellion and undermined imperialism, which Communists and President Wilson in his Fourteen Points had already addressed. Without the success of the Revolt and Britain's support for Hussein's cause, transition from Turkish Ottoman rule to the French and British Mandates in Syria and Iraq would probably not have been as smooth. Without the Revolt -- and Lawrence's involvement in it -- Arab  acquisition of self-government in these countries would have quite possibly taken longer than it did.<br /><br />Even the inference that Lawrence was homosexual is baseless. Those who knew him well have stated adamantly that he was not. In  [[ASIN:1569249954 T. E. Lawrence: The Selected Letters]] to a homosexual man, Lawrence wrote that he did not find homosexuality morally wrong, yet he did find it distasteful.<br /><br />As for the Ottoman commander (played by Jose Ferrer) whom Lawrence accused of whipping and sodomising him in Deraa, the Bey went on to lead a blameless post-war life without a trace of scandal. Modern biographers have also questioned whether the incident actually occurred. Firstly, there's a problem with the chronology of Lawrence's account, whose subsequent sex-life after Deraa revolved around male flagellation or masochism and a rigid programme of physical rehabilitation. Secondly, Lawrence's own statements and actionsconcerning the incident have contributed to the confusion;  while he mentions it in [[ASIN:0385418957 Seven Pillars of Wisdom: A Triumph]] he removed a page from his war diary covering the event in question.<br /><br />Despite the many, many historical falsehoods about Lawrence and the events surrounding his campaign in the Middle East portrayed in Lawrence of Arabia, I still love David Lean's film for its epic grandeur, Maurice Jarre's sweeping score and Peter O'Toole's superb performance. I suppose had it not been for these factors, I and many viewers would probably never have been introduced to Lawrence, let alone be interested in him or the Middle East. Having said that, I rate the film five stars for artistic merit; however, for its historical content, I give it 1 star. Sorry, facts cannot be rewritten.<br /><br />As for the quality of the one disc DVD, which  this review is based on, the wide screen format is sufficient for projecting the breathtaking panorama of the desert. The price is ideal too. If you want to wait and see more depth and clarity, I would imagine a Blu-Ray DVD would be the disc to get in the future.e confusion;  while he mentions it in [[ASIN:0385418957 Seven Pillars of Wisdom: A Triumph]] he removed a page from his war diary covering the event in question.

As for the quality of the one disc DVD, which  this review is based on, the wide screen format is sufficient for projecting the breathtaking panorama of the desert. The price is ideal too. If you want to wait and see more depth and clarity, I would imagine a Blu-Ray DVD would be the disc to get in the future.
032147404X|3.0|I found this book on the basics of digital photography with an SLR camera to be very useful and easy to digest. The author uses light humour and a very personal approach to inform without being pedantic. The format looks more like a magazine with some advertisements included and the liberal use of photos and useful hints makes it very readable for the beginner. For instance, the author recommends using a monopod at sporting events (tripods are banned at my ballpark)to get sharp closeup images.     There are other books available that cover the more technical aspects of photography but this is a good read for those who prefer to learn by just using their equipment without getting wrapped up with a lot of jargon. It can also be a good reference book (only 209 pages long)for someone who wants to improve their technique because each subject has a brief explanation which usually covers the point. As someone who has recently purchased a digital SLR I will make good use of this easy-to-read book on the basics of photography.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Oh my goodness...I just did this workout for the first time tonight and I could barely climb the stairs after I was finished.  I did the level 1 workout and it was really hard, but I felt so accomplished when I finished it.  The workout is a 3-2-1 circuit style...3 minutes of strength, 2 of cardio and 1 of abs.  This cycle is completed three times.  The warmup and cooldown are both very short.  Jillian is encouraging and friendly but cuts you no slack at all.  The moves are all very basic but the workout seems designed for efficiency.  I am going to try to do this for 30 days and we'll see how it works.  Great workout!
B000WC3AKI|4.0|I actually am a stormchaser, and this movie has inspired much laughter. I often joke that the only lines in the movie that make any sense are 'Go to the bathroom now, you may not get a chance on the road.\\" And that is fairly accurate (both about the movie and about one of the greatest challenges in stormchasing). But unlike most Summer action films this one at least tried its best to be realistic. They did use some phrases in hopelessly wrong contexts, and they often made up their own phrases when it moved the dialog along, but then this is Hollywood. What can you expect.     That said, this was a fun film the first time, and we have watched it in the van while chasing many times, mostly for amusement. The effects are very good, and the cast is wonderful. Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of the best actors in a generation and here you get to see an early incarnation of him, and see him seem to actually be having fun. Yeah, get the movie, don't forget the beers. See you in Oklahoma this May.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|Give it up... do as Madge says, give it up and let Madge have her way........What's in a name?  Madonna defines herself as a true diva in everyone's favourite Madonna album, \\"Erotica\\".  The diva herself made it quite clear to me, to address her by her god given name, one day at an autograph signing party.  I addressed her as \\"Mad,Donna\\" and she reacted with authoritative intensity.  She pointed her white crooked finger at me and remarked 'Hey!!...No one EVER calls me that.\\" and simply bypassed my cd waiting to be signed.  It was at this time I knew Madonna had arrived, in true dominatrix fashion, claiming her reign as \\"Mistress Madonna\\", which I hear is what she demands to be called in \\"certain circles\\".  This being said, \\"Erotica\\" showcases the tough, edgier, darker side of Madonna which no one had seen in full flair before the albums release.  \\"Erotica\\" became an instant classic in the gay club scene and became the urban young gay man's soundtrack during the early roaring ninties.  Some of Madonna's best are on \\"Erotica\\", including the title track, \\"Fever\\", \\"Bye Bye Baby\\", \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"Thief of Hearts\\", \\"Bad Girl\\", and \\"Rain\\".  All of Madonna's style, mystery, and sexuality climaxed during this rare time of fun, freedom, and sexual exploration.  It cannot be duplicated and you were privliged to experience this moment in time.
630542845X|4.0|An interesting commentary on humanities acceptance, or lack there of, of those who are different.  This has some aspects of the \\"paranormal\\" type movies, but is really much more of a social commentary.    Great movie for those who enjoy the classics.  Don't watch this expecting the X-files though.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|The movie starts off with a bang. A funny scene that sets the pace for alittle over half the movie. After that the movie starts to drag but ends fairly well.     The second half of the movie is what really stops this from being a classic but doesnt stop this from being a must see movie.    It's policaly incorrect and a lot of fun. A must see.
1400064287|5.0|When one business colleague suggests I read a book, I write the title down. When three tell me, I get on-line and order it. Made to Stick is contagious in its humor, specific in its principles, and consistent in its use of case studies to demonstrate practical application of Chip and Dan's sticky messaging theories. I've often grabbed the book, turned it over, and sized up an idea against the SUCCES qualities checklist on the back cover.
B0014CQNTK|5.0|Buy this movie. This is easily in my view the best picture of 2007 thats right better than No country for old men.  Juno was a heart warming story filled with laughs and even lighter moments. The movie is wonderfully written and directed. The acting is top notch.  Only once in a great while does a movie like this come out. A must see i recommend buying it.  Go see this movie.
0060594888|2.0|This is a fairly decent \\"quick and dirty\\" overview of the ideas many of the popular \\"success\\" gurus are selling, complete with web/contact info (which would have been fine at the back of the book, but they are in numerous footnotes throughout the main text, which is really annoying).<br /><br />Several good ideas are here, and all in one place, but you have to wade through a LOT of self-congratulatory passages from Canfield, and there are some glaring contradictions--in one chapter he talks about getting your financial house in order, even mentioning Kiyosaki's definition of an asset. BUT, like all success gurus, he is always pushing success being all about more money and more stuff (\\"doodads\\" in Kiyosaki's books).  Success is NOT necessarily about money and stuff, not to everyone.<br /><br />Canfield also talks about relationships and marriage, yet admits to having a prenup, which says something right there about how he truly feels about marriage.  Read up on many of these gurus and you'll see that many of them have been married more than once. Makes you wonder, doesn't it?<br /><br />The book serves as a decent compendium of several success principles, if you can get past the contradictions and the bragging.  I read it after reading Helping Me Help Myself by Beth Lisick.<br /><br />Buy used.
0307346617|5.0|World War Z differs from other 'zombie apocalypse' books mainly due to it's approach, candid interviews with survivors from all walks of life, all over the globe.  We aren't following one lone survivor, we catch a glimpse of the horror from many firsthand accounts.    Brooks covers a gamut of survivors, some tales are gripping blow by blow accounts of survival, while others play on the moral and political aspects of the war against the zombies.      I've heard this is being worked into a movie, if the film loses the journalistic/documentary approach of the book, I'll be disappointed.
B000FGG60W|4.0|The HD version of this film is better than the original DVD.  Vin Diesel does a great job of introducing Riddick for the following hair raiser with total destruction of the universe at hand.  The detail in the cut is extremely vivid and the sound is somewhat better than the original if your system can deliver it.<br />After watching this movie any kid and some adults would be afraid of the dark for the rest of their lives.  A great story is told as a passenger ship is taken off course by a rogue comet and runs into the debris which causes the ship to hemorrhage air and crash land on an unknown planet.  As if this is not exciting enough, the fun just begins as their adventure begins when the planet enters into a lengthy eclipse and night time becomes the normal way of life.  Hold onto your seats as only Riddick can really navigate through this environment.<br />Great Movie.
B00154GEFU|5.0|Downes, Howe, Palmer, and Wetton have given us an extraoridnary disc.  The production and engineering is crisp and clean.  The musicianship is masterful.  The vocals are powerful.  The songwriting is stellar and quite even throughout.  And the final cut, \\"An Extraordinary Life,\\" is magnificent.  All four are at the highest level here.

B000NQPZCY|5.0|Imposible to find here in Europe the DVD version of Revenge, I had the chance to get the Blu Ray Region Free Edition. Movie was filmed in 1990 but quality of video transfer is very impressive and crisp. PCM Uncompressed Sound is also great.  New cut of the movie by Tony Scott himself is shorter but even blooder than original, but´s a wonderful piece of romantic drama.  In my opinion it´s best work by Scott, Kevin Costner and beautiful Madeleine Stowe. Solid drama, creat acting, lovely landscape and a really outstanding music score by Jack Nitzsche.  Fully Recommended. Score 9.5/10

0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card tells a futuristic tale, yet it is only a prediction of what the modern world would look like. In Ender's Game, he explains the hardships of gifted children who are isolated in order to develop prowess.      Card is a writer of various genres including science fiction, fantasies, biblical works, and guides to writing. He also writes screenplays, which are possibly influenced by the encouragement of plays by the Mormon Church in his childhood. He writes commentaries in \\"Uncle Orson Reviews Everything,\\" a writing column which appears online, as well as giving his opinions on culture, politics, and the world. In fact, he offers writing assist programs, which are offered on his website.     Card clearly demonstrates the tales of Ender that he created and displays his goal throughout. As an example, Bonzo, an elder, Hispanic student, abhors Ender because he disobeyed Bonzo's orders and assaults him. A cornered Ender manages to overcome Bonzo and injures him. As a result, Ender believes he is a murderer like his diabolical brother Peter because he harmed others. Ender struggles himself because of his discoveries of possible similarities with his nemesis sibling. Unlike his brother, Ender does not take pride in destroying others and commits this action because he is often pushed into situations which demand physical defense. This portrayal and situation in the novel justifies Ender's actions. Card connects many readers to the feelings and situations Ender has to endure. In fact, people who read the book believe they are similar to Ender.             Although Ender's epic quest in the military academy as well as his hardships draw the readers' attention, the novel does not challenge them with difficult vocabulary or language. However, this is not the intent of Card, who instead exercises a simple array of vocabulary in order to allow his novel to be understood by many people, and this is part of the reason the book managed to achieve its success.

B0002YLC24|5.0|I stumbled onto Before Sunrise & Before Sunset on HBO late one night while I was sick.  I DVR'd them and watch them both a ton, and now I have bought the DVD's just in case I loose them on my DVR.  Both characters are so real and complex, and while in someways the same, in others they are totally different.  I love the way Celine's outlook on life and things changes so much over the years they are apart, but meeting Jesse again in France I think really centers her back to her true self.    I love both of these movies and they are in my hall of fame.

B000OIAMYC|5.0|I bought this book back in the early 80's and it served to explain and promote the mysterious C programming language. At the time, most languages were all trying to be easy to read and this seemed to be an esoteric and intriguing approach. The style is deliberate and detailed yet it doesn't overwhelm. It begins to promote thinking both from the high level and at the bit level concurrently--a notion contrary to the sensibilities of the time.<br /><br />Though there are more comprehensive books dealing with C and it's pumped up brother C++, this is still viable with its quaint innocent style which sums up a period when it was only necessary to know one language to be a marketable programmer.
0307265730|4.0|Ever since the publication of her mesmerizing, Pulitzer Prize winning debut collection, [[ASIN:0618101365 Interpreter of Maladies]],  Jhumpa Lahiri has established herself as one of modern fiction's most powerful voices.  The stories in that collection showcased what was to become Lahiri's trademark: acute psychological observations, eloquent writing, detailed descriptions, and a fiercely intelligent structure.  As in poetry, each word feels carefully chosen, yet the overall ease with which the narratives flow belies the effort that undoubtedly went into them.  \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" also served to debut Lahiri's dominant theme in that each story featured Indian characters struggling to adapt to new surroundings after immigrating to the U.S.  Her sophomore effort, [[ASIN:0618485228 The Namesake: A Novel]] expanded this theme into a wonderful full-length novel about the gap between a boy born and raised in America and his immigrant parents, who cling to their old traditions and ways of life.  Lahiri, who was herself born in London but raised in New England, has made a career out of telling stories of cultural displacement, and until now she never once faltered when it came to crafting a powerful story.<br /><br />\\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" marks Lahiri's return to the short story format, and while I had been looking forward to it with high anticipation, the product is surprising.  Perhaps Lahiri succeeded at the transition from short stories to novels a little too well, because suddenly it feels like she has much more to say in an all-too-limited page count.  The shortest story in the collection is \\"Hell-Heaven,\\" which at twenty-four pages would have been right at home in \\"Interpreter of Maladies,\\" and while it is one of the better offerings it feels clipped, as though there was so much more to say and not enough time to say it.  Instead, the stories in \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" verge on novella territory, allowing Lahiri to indulge in the slow-burn style she perfected in \\"The Namesake\\".  The last three stories interlock to tell a single story in three parts, completing this effect.  There aren't many authors who are at their best when they take their time, but Lahiri seems to be one of them.  But this is a minor complaint.<br /><br />I do, however, have more pointed concerns after reading Lahiri's latest work.  Firstly, she seems to have acquired a taste for the melodramatic that doesn't suit her elegant style at all.  Lahiri's writing is always very restrained when it comes to emotions, which is one of her strong suits, so when she indulges in plot contrivances such as alcoholism and abusive relationships it feels forced and more than a little jarring.  Quiet desperation is more apt for her style; it is what makes it feel so authentic.  Melodrama makes it feel theatrical.  The high points of \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" are its beginning and ending, \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" and the saga of Hema and Kaushik, which notably steer clear of these plot elements.  Luckily, Lahiri seems incapable of writing anything that doesn't maintain a grip on realism, but it still felt out of place to this reader.<br /><br />Secondly, Lahiri's characters are starting to suffer from a degree of sameness.  Perhaps that is why she infused the melodrama that I just discussed into the collection's middle section, but the fact that each character seems to have an ivy-league education and a doctorate and strikingly similar back stories still begins to feel stultifying.<br /><br />Despite these complaints, Lahiri remains one of the most psychologically astute writers out there, and her keen plotting and pointed observations make \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" tower head and shoulders above most other literary offerings.  And even though I feel warier about what direction her next book will take, I still have the utmost faith in her abilities and look forward to it with the same degree of anticipation that I waited for \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\".<br /><br />Grade: B+ake\\".

B000N3ST9I|2.0|If you got hooked onto Machinehead with either Burn My Eyes or The More Things Change, then is not the album for you.  It is a vast improvement over the middle part of their career, but still lacks the edge they had in the beginning.  I could only listen to the album twice before it was put on the shelf forever, never to be played again.  Through the Ashes is better than this album ever had the potential to be, but even that was lacking in writing and production. The only way Machinehead will become the metal tyrant like the days of old is to get Logan Mader back on lead and reapply the thrash/hardcore stylings again.
B00004S367|5.0|It doesn't happen very often but there are some albums I listen to that leave me at a loss for words. I struggle for ages to find the appropriate words to use to describe them in a review and in the end, I often just give up.<br /><br />This gem from 1972; the first of five albums widely hailed as Wonder's \\"classic period\\", is a typical example. (Wonder's 1974 album, [[ASIN:B00004S35Z Fulfillingness' First Finale]] was another. I did attempt a review some time ago and ended up babbling for a scant few lines about how listening to it was like being like a \\"spiritual journey\\". Sometimes I feel like going back and deleting the review but it's an accurate reflection of how I felt about it, so I leave it be).<br /><br />And in case anyone is wondering, the other three albums from the period are [[ASIN:B00004S36A Talking Book]], [[ASIN:B00004S363 Innervisions]] and, of course, [[ASIN:B00004SZWD Songs in the Key of Life]].<br /><br />\\"Superwoman\\" was the popular single from this set, the song most folks remember and the one so many people have covered but people unfamiliar with the album might be surprised to learn that the song is by no means the best thing on offer here. This is only my personal opinion but the incredibly funky tunes \\"Love Having You Around\\" & \\"I Love Every Little Thing About You\\" and the mid-tempo \\"Sweet Little Girl\\" (with it's awesome, mellow, nice & easy refrain) and the ballads \\"Happier Than The Morning Sun\\" & \\"Seems So Long\\" are much more memorable, much more soulful and much more satisfying.<br /><br />Produced by the man himself and largely written by him too (he wrote a few with Syreeta Wright, although the CD inner-sleeve notes credit her as \\"Y. Wright\\"), the work is described as \\"virtually the work of one man\\". Buzzy Feiton plays a guitar solo on \\"Superwoman\\" and Art Baron a trombone solo on \\"Love Having You Around\\" but every other single instrument is performed by Wonder himself. Including the vocoder, a device Wonder was using way before Herbie Hancock or Roger Troutman (although never to modify or enhance his lead vocal) and a device that seems to be back in vogue these days. \\"The sounds themselves come from inside his mind,\\" state the inner-sleeve notes. It's entirely possible he performed all the backing vocals as well. Listening to the album, it's very hard to believe (especially listening to the upbeat \\"Keep On Running\\", the other single from the album) but no backing singers are credited so, unless someone knows different..?<br /><br />If you love Stevie, if you love soul or if you just love good, real music, then you either have this already or you need to check it out.<br /><br />(Phew!

B000NQRV4O|3.0|Plenty of reviews of the movie already, so either you like it or you didn't.  I couldn't really see any reason to have bought this in Blu-Ray.  There were no alternate endings or anything, it's just a drama, so the graphic impact of the upgraded player are minimal....  This seems like a waste of money when a regular DVD would have done just as well.

044024238X|5.0|After reading \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" by Sophie Kinsella, I wanted more. I got this book, and when I started reading it, I could not put it down.  I was drawn in by the character's law firm job and thought the description of that life is accurate.  The book just kept getting better, and I lost sleep because I needed to finish it before I went to bed. Kinsella tells a great story, and kept me intrigued the whole time.  It starts with a woman completely immersed in her law firm career, with no time for other things, such as family.  The book has some turmoil, some humor, and some romance, and in all, and I loved it. I highly recommend this book, and will be checking out Kinsella's Shopaholic series next.
B000N6TYLW|2.0|Lets see. This season wasnt that great. I blame the writers. Not that they weren't terrific i just think that it was too much for them to handle. They just werent ready for this. The only good events were all the stuff with Lane and Zack, everything having to do with Rory though sometimes i wanted to put her through a wall and just leave her there, and the very last episode. The moment that i most cheered about was when Lorelia and Chris divorced. I jumped, literally jumped out of my chair when that one happened. Either way it's still worth owning but serously lacks something, oh wait i know what it was that's right spunk, the fire went out in this season my friend. It went out and not in a nice subtle way but in a BAM there goes the fire kind of way.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|As some of you may know (though it'd be impossible to miss considering the lib media's all over it), Gore recently won the questionable Nobel Peace Prize for his manipulative work on climate change, climate change which, ironically enough, is totally debunked as being manmade in Chris Horner's masterpiece, the Politically Incorrect Guide To Global Warming. As a result of Gore's doubtful win--mainly by a Nobel committee which is ideologically leaning to the left by far--this has boosted his visibility and also that of the products he hawks, such as this Inconvenient Truth DVD. However, this is where I come in.<br /><br />I'm concerned about folks getting ripped off by a charlatan such as Gore, especially now when Democrats are unrelentingly moaning and charging that real income's down despite Bush's tax cuts. So, my review is expressly intended as a caution, a warning and an alert for all the gullible consumers out there who may misjudge and unwisely buy this DVD just because of Gore's political/ideological Nobel win.<br /><br />What many of you impressionably gullible people may not know about Gore's DVD is that the REAL, INCONVENIENT TRUTH is an English judge recently ruled that Gore's propaganda-film is not science but political, emphasizes alarmism and exaggeration over science, and now should come with a disclaimer for teachers to balance Gore's partisan opinions. This is what you indiscriminate and submissive customers are buying when you actually give your hard-earned money to Gore's propaganda: not a film based on facts, but a radicalized, liberal demagoguery planned to further the cause of socialism based on increased government regulations to increase control over the private sector. Is this really the ulterior motive that you environmentalists and Gore-sheeple want to support????!!!! Ruefully yes, despite all the demerits to your cause.<br /><br />Since I care about you gullible Gore-disciples parting with your hard-earned money, I'll now outline in painstaking detail EACH OF THE NINE untruths in the Inconvenient Truth DVD.<br /><br />They are:<br /><br />1)  Gore infects Inconvenient Truth with forgeries about the unprovable urgency of levels of devastation caused by the rise in sea levels due to insignificantly melting ice caps. Gore fabricates this rise would be in the near future, yet the consensus is actually millennia away.<br />2)  Gore falsifies that some atolls in the Pacific had already been evacuated, yet a closer look totally solidifies that this imaginary \\"evacuation\\" has in fact not at all occurred.<br />3)  Gore manipulatively shows two charts relating to carbon dioxide levels and temperatures over the last 650000 years and alleges they're an exact fit. This is plotted to further fan the alarmist flames of manmade global warming. However, the British judge in the case contemptuously rebuked Gore by branding this misuse of the charts as an overstatement of his case.<br />4)  Gore hysterically purports that the Gulf Stream--which warms up the Atlantic ocean--will shut down, and this is (pathetically and emphatically) disproved by the International Panel on Climate Change's own assessment. This group itself is partisan and favors an interpretation where global warming is believed, yet their own report tarnished Gore's Gulf Stream claim as \\"very unlikely to happen.\\"<br />5)  Gore disingenuously blames the mediocre drying of Lake Chad on climate change, yet Chad's drying is more reliably blamed on less sinister causes such as population increase, regional climate variability, and overgrazing.<br />6)  Next, Gore cunningly blames the apparent loss of Mount Kilimanjaro's snows on--anyone want to take a wild guess?--climate change, but in actuality, the judge reprimanded Gore for there not being a direct link that the scientific community could find.<br />7)  Similarly, Gore mindlessly holds climate change accountable for Hurricane Katrina (instead of blaming the chronically inept, Democratic state/local governments of Blanco and Nagin for its mishandled aftermath!!!!), yet there again, the scientific community has no consensus linking that to climate change.<br />8)  Gore fiendishly plots to tug at the heartstrings of liberals by contriving that those poor, defenseless creatures called polar bears were actually drowning in their hopeless struggle of finding some icy habitats within all that melting from \\"global warming.\\" However, the judge could only find four bears which died after a storm, also not caused by climate change.<br />9)  Gore underhandedly blames coral bleaching on--c'mon everyone, take another wild guess!!!!--climate change, yet the judge ruled that separating direct impacts of climate change on coral beaching from other factors was difficult, if not impossible.<br /><br />There you have it, Gore-sheeple. I've confronted all of your ideological yet undeserved trust in Gore and discredited it using widely available facts. After this absolute, irrefutable debunking of your ideologue, Gore, you Gore sycophants have no further excuse for buying this DVD propaganda!!!! If you truly want to contribute to something positive, spare the money you'd give to Gore and instead donate it to some dependable, American charities that follow their money. To do anything else at this point would be mortifying and reduce you further to laughingstocks.t there again, the scientific community has no consensus linking that to climate change.  8)  Gore fiendishly plots to tug at the heartstrings of liberals by contriving that those poor, defenseless creatures called polar bears were actually drowning in their hopeless struggle of finding some icy habitats within all that melting from \\"global warming.\\" However, the judge could only find four bears which died after a storm, also not caused by climate change.  9)  Gore underhandedly blames coral bleaching on--c'mon everyone, take another wild guess!!!!--climate change, yet the judge ruled that separating direct impacts of climate change on coral beaching from other factors was difficult, if not impossible.

B000VLE3IS|5.0|Last fall I was in Borders, and they had all of the studio albums on sale, and I really though about it, and then I tried to justify it financially, and that day I couldn't make it work out in my mind that I deserved to buy them all, and I didn't want to get just one, although I did have Zorso in my cart, I put it back.<br /><br />Then around the end of the year, the week before the big concert I saw this set, and couldn't resist. When I opened it, I saw the sweepstakes ticket for a chance to see the show in London, and again tried to think if I could even get my passport up to date... I just decided to settle for listening non stop for a week and reminisce about the old High School Parties that all of this music was a soundtrack for during the Mid 70's.<br /><br />Truly, although we had a lot of other favorites, in those days, when Led Zeppelin was still making music it always had the heaviest rotation on our turntables and 8trac's.<br /><br />Listening to these CD's after all these years, it reminded me how on the Vanguard these guys were, innovative and memorable. These songs set the standard for what is Classic Rock<br /><br />If you (like me) haven't had this music since your 8-trac died, this set will take you satisfyingly down memory lane like it did me.
B0013FBS20|4.0|This movie is great.  Good acting from Will Smith and company.  Warner Brothers could have done more with the package design and special features.  Also Warner should create more movies using 7.1 DTS HD.  Will Smith fans deserve the best since he gets paid alot for his movie and music.
B000VSBX34|5.0|It has been a long time since I saw Help, but thoroughly enjoyed just as much this time as I did the first time.  Absolutely worth buying.
B0002V7O3I|4.0|I give this a 4 instead of a five, because it did not hold the children's attention the way I like to see of a movie.<br />And my son said to me, \\"Mom what are you watching? It looks wierd.\\"<br />4 is a good number, though, because it is cute with good messages woven in for the younger set.<br />There is a point in the movie when it seems that the writers don't know where to go with the story.  That's when the costumes come in and are really extreme and distracting, from my point of view, but<br />The kids loved that part.
B0000542D2|5.0|The last time I saw this movie was when I was 12 and sat thru it 15 times with my best friend... I enjoyed it this time just as much (Only with no screaming)
0765348780|3.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES.  Now that i've got that out this book was very difficult to get through. not alot made sense it seemed a book that started in the middle and ended in the middle. To be perfectly honest the only way i made it through this book was the fact that i was locked on an 8 hour flight with somebody asleep blocking the aisle. now the book isn't totally without merit I love the characters the dark pathos of anomander rake and the tiste andii the wily quick ben and the deadly kalam (both of which see a lot of developement as the series progresses)not to mention captain paran who I in turns hated and loved. But to those of you looking for a spectacular fantasy series this weak book is but the iron door leading to spectacular wonder. The later books are in turns spectacular and heart wrenchingly human every character from the gods to the lowliest soldier has human motives and is painfully real. Later books in the series had me in tears because of the power of emotion and imagery hear. So i beg you read this story make it through then read the rest you'll thank me.
B000OONTFU|4.0|No, not once did I ever think that Neo (Keanu Reeves} was in any way, shape or form Jesus Christ like so many have made that analogy.  If I had to compare Neo to any other entity, it would be Paul Atreades (Mordib) the messiah like character portrayed by Kyle MacLachlan in the David Lynch movie \\"Dune\\". That's where any similarities end. When I saw the first installment in \\"The Matrix\\", I was more fascinated by the special effects than I was of the plot, but now having seen all three installments, I see how really important \\"The Matrix\\" was in setting up the next two installments.  Kudos to the Wachowski Brothers in making a worthy sci-fi trilogy, one you can watch again and again throughout your lifetime.  The \\"Ultimate Matrix\\" collection is a must have for any collector. There's a fourth disk going into the making of the trilogy.  The HD DVD presentation is fantastic and preserves this collector's edition for all time.  The detail is  phenominal in that it reveals things I missed completely in the dvd version even though they weren't important in the telling of the story. I gave this movie four stars instead of five because political correctness was evident in every scene, and there were underlying political messages that tried to seep through from time to time.  I would give this movie four stars for the movie itself and five stars for the technical presentation.
B000X7SC1O|1.0|I bought this dvd for exactly the same reason as the other person reviewing it; when I read that review, I thought I had written it. I wanted to be familiar with the plot and dialogue before seeing the show on Broadway. To that extent, it was worth it. But the quality is atrocious--fuzzy and jumpy. It almost looks like a flip book of stills. The movie itself is quite good, and exhibited in 1935 many of the characteristics and scenes we're familiar with in The Master's later movies: a quirky hero, the edgy-funny-sexy pairings, the climax in the theater. If you're interested in this movie, spring for the $29.95; this cheapo-cheapo edition is a waste of money.
B000E1MTY0|4.0|Batman has been my favorite superhero for over fifty years.  I have seen every Batman movie a number of times and even though they were campy and  fun, I wasn't completely satisfied with any of them. I wanted Batman to be darker, sinister and more complex, more like a vigilante outside the law, and I didn't want Robin and Batgirl tagging along either.  When I saw \\"Batman Begins\\" on opening day in the theaters in 2006, I was  pleasantly surprised.  Christopher Nolan had given me the perfect Batman portayed by Christian Bale. The supporting cast was outstanding. Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as Gordon, Katie Holmes as his childhood love, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman to round out the cast and all gave superlative performances. The story was fitting for a superhero, and the Batmobile was an added bonus. Even the background music track was excellent. This movie surpassed all my expectations.  My only criticism is the editing; all the rules of continunity were broken and some of the shots were so brief that it was hard to grasp what just happened, but somehow they made it all work. The HD rendition is superb, revealling little things I missed on the dvd version.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I am a Beatles fan. Always have been . But I wonder whether this was a necessary trip. Yes It takes several songs, meshes them together with other lyrics and sound that can be best enjoyed under a 60's drug haze. Parts were good and as a fan I welcome anything with the Beatles. But it seems to me that this collaboration seems only to serve the Cirque de Soleil. Good for a listen, but you might be more confused. Why mess with a winning formula?
B000P0J05G|2.0|When I saw this HD DVD featured on Amazon, I thought it was a recent movie.  I purchased the movie and upon watching it, realized I had rented it several years ago, 1993 I think.  The date the manufacturers are putting on the box is the day it became HD, not necessarily the year it was produced. Yes, you can package something HD and it will look better for all intents and purposes, and this one does, but nevertheless this one is very forgettable.  The plot is a different spin on a \\"Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" by Mark Twain.  Bruce Campbell plays a manager in a department store who is catapulted in vintage Pontiac back to the days of Camelot.  The plot involves a book that unleashes dead zombies that attack the castle and the plot gets sillier and sillier. Adding profanity, including the \\"f\\" word in an attempt to make this asinine infantile excursion into something more adult completely missed the mark. This performance by Campbell is probably why he has been relegated to second and third tier supporting roles in subsequent movies.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Like all Attenborough productions, this is well worth watching; again and again and again.  The Diaries are a fun and funny look at the side of wildlife photography we never see.    I am disappointed, however, that David Attenborough has jumped on the global warming bandwagon and I could not even watch the entire fifth disk.  But the first four disks are well worth the investment.
0425166805|5.0|This book was so interesting that I couldn't put it down.  IT was easy to read and all encompassing.  It arrived quickly and well protected from the elements.  You'll love this book.  Was earth visited by ancient astronauts?
B0013FDM7E|2.0|SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />I honestly thought this was going to be another Will Smith blockbuster movie, but I'm still wondering what happened in the middle of shooting this film??  Was there a tiff between Smith and the director, or the direcor and the producer?  Who knows.  The first half hour of this film is typical Smith action movie.  You are reminded of movies like Independance Day and War of the Worlds right off the bat.  It's an empty city and Smith is the only survivor.  Can you imagine the possibilities for this film??<br /><br />How the story presents itself is through flashbacks.  Smith is a Military Commander and he apparently is in charge of finding the cure for this deadly virus that instead of curing its patients, is practically killing them.  But that's not all of it though.  Apparently, some humans are not dying, but turning into bloodthirsty vampires who only live in the dark and have supernatural strength apparently.  Sounds crazy huh?  Well, the movie still deserves a chance despite that ridiculous premise.  I gave it a chance, but could only find myself counting the flaws and holes in the plot all throughout.  The issues I had with this film were certain holes that were in the story and certain things that were left out that were critical to making this a believable story.  It's hard to believe, but with a story so complex as this, this movie should have been over 2 hours.  It's not, it's well under and leaves a lot more to be desired.<br /><br />The one scene that perplexes me is the scene with the mannequin that was placed as a trap.  Smith flips out that a mannequin that he saw at the video store was placed somewhere else in the city.  Now here's where it gets fishy.  Smith has acknowledged that the vampires have lost all human abilities, yet for some reason that trap was set up for him in front of that building.  I was asking myself, who set it up, the vampires or Smith himself?  And if he set it up himself, why would he forget about it and go crazy as a result?  The better answer was that the vampires weren't that primitive afterall, but intelligent and were setting the trap to catch Smith and eat him I guess.  My question is, why didn't they run with that story, why didn't they play the cat and mouse game after that?  Instead, the film takes the direction of Smith's paranoia and depression in a lonely world until miraculously 2 people come to New York to save him.  They briefly manage to get into an argument about God of all things (hidden message), and what results is a failed rescue attempt by 2 people who really wouldn't have the courage to drive all the way down there to find Smith in the first place.<br /><br />The ending is quite abrupt and provides no closure to the story.  Aside from the first half of the movie and various special effects, this movie is a huge bust in my opinion.  This could have been a thriller movie as man versus monster, but the story is about man versus conscience and man versus duty that ultimately plays out as a dull narrative as how one man reacts to the isolation around him.<br /><br />D+he better answer was that the vampires weren't that primitive afterall, but intelligent and were setting the trap to catch Smith and eat him I guess.

B0002J4X1Q|3.0|In the never-ending effort to find new material for movies, the industry has gone to a whole host of new media over the past 2 or 3 decades to include graphic novels, video and computer games, and even theme park rides.  Perhaps not surprisingly game adaptations have been perhaps the least success of all the films based on new sources.  Almost without exception movies based on console or computer games have been unspeakably awful.  RESIDENT EVIL, while not a great movie, nonetheless manages to be perhaps the best that the genre has produced.  It has, moreover, provoked two sequels that are both arguably better than the film that started it off.<br /><br />I have not played RESIDENT EVIL (apart from RPGs like Dungeon Siege and Elderscrolls and especially MMORPGs like Asheron's Call and World of Warcraft I generally avoid games), so I don't know how closely this film adheres to its storyline, but you constantly feel the restrictions of a highly predetermined story line.  The entire film -- unlike the sequel -- feels as if it is progressing via a formula.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich has managed to build a career playing strong, heroic women.  The first film most people know her from is THE FIFTH ELEMENT, but she later went on to make THE MESSENGER (about Joan of Arc), also with Luc Besson at the helm (over the course of his career he has constantly made films featuring female action heroes).  She does a creditable job in all three as someone who manages to be heroic despite attempts at the Umbrella Corporation to manipulate her for their own purposes.<br /><br />This can be a fun movie if gone into with rather low expectations.  There is a low of gore, some pretty tense moments, but not a lot of plot.  As usual in these movies, greedy corporations are ultimately the enemy (something even truer in real life, yet why don't we remember that in real life?).  If taken for what it is -- slick fluff -- it can be enjoyable.  But if you start interrogating the plot and trying to make sense of it, you'll get frustrated quick.<br /><br />I first saw this several years ago.  At that time the only cast members I knew were Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez.  On this rescreening I was pleasantly surprised to see Eric Mabius in one of the main roles.  He is best known today as Daniel Meade on UGLY BETTY.  And while he doesn't quite make it into the sequel, his character sorta, kinda does.ll get frustrated quick.

B00139B39E|3.0|If I could only have bought Disc 1, I would have been happier. But for the price I'll go with it. I've always preferred their Darker side.<br /><br />So pretty much, with an embarassment entitled \\"Systematic Chaos\\" out, the Theater needed to release a compilation called \\"Greatest Hit... and 21 Other Pretty Cool Soongs\\". As much as I like Disc one (which is really all they needed to release), I can't say the same for disc 2, which is almost an entire CD of Ballads (hence \\"Light side\\"). The remix of \\"Another Day\\" is completely unneccesary- Release the original one, already! Granted, one advantage is that Kevin Shirley, the producer of my all time favorite band Iron Maiden, remixes it. Example- Hollow Years- which is the all time low for the theater. It's painfully slow, and doesn't move at all!!!<br /><br />Granted, disc one is pretty awesome. Some more agressive stuff, Classics like Take the Time, Pull me under, and Sacrificed Sons. Now THAT'S the compilation we want.<br /><br />So overall- worth it if you're a newcomer, but if you're a die hard, then you might wanna stay away.<br /><br />DISC 1: 4 STARS<br />DISC 2: 2.5 STARS
B0002KQNZO|5.0|THIS IS ONE TRULY GREAT RECORDING, WITH A GREAT BAND. CURTIS FULLER, WAYNE SHORTER, FREDDIE HUBBARD, CEDAR WALTON, REGGIE WORKMAN. WOW!  AND ART BLAKEY IS ON FIRE. IF YOU ENJOY LISTENING TO THE HARD BOP SOUND, THEN THIS ALBUM IS A MUST-HAVE FOR YOU.  ANOTHER GREAT BLUE NOTE RECORDING FROM THE EARLY 60'S.............
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|\\"Transamerica\\" is worth watching solely because of Felicity Huffman's performance. The terrific actress plays Bree, a not-quite-yet woman waiting for the final sex-reassignment operation. However, a couple of days before the operation, Bree gets a phone call from NYPD, informing her she has a son and that she needs to get there and bail him out. Bree reluctantly does that, but instead of telling her hustler son she is his mother, she tells him she is a missionary and offers to drive him to California, where he wants to become a porn actor.<br />This is a movie with real people and real problems. On the way to the East Coast, there are many twists and turns awaiting Bree and her son, and it adds to the humanity of these two, well, unique people. A very admirable aspect of this movie is that it never treats transsexuals as jokes - and Felicity Huffman always plays her character with respect. It is truly an Oscar-worthy performance. Another outstanding performance here is by Kevin Zegers, playing Bree's problematic son - and just you wait 'till you see the background story. All in all, a movie to watch at least once, and an actress to cherish.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|If you want a story that is close to accurate with the splendor of actors and extras instead of CGI, this is the movie. What a story! They just do not make them like this anymore and the two main actors are right on!

038073186X|4.0|I've known of Dennis Lehane for a while.  Noticed a few films had been adapted from his works, so I thought I'd give him a shot.  I picked up Shutter Island because it isn't a movie (yet, it's coming), and thus I would be able to come to it objectively.<br /><br />Right from the start I liked his writing style.  There's a plot, but it isn't aggressively pursued in the beginning. Instead we kind of ease into the very strange island, and it's inhabitants.  Gradually the plot becomes stranger and stranger, with plot turns making it less and less clear what exactly is going on, rather than slowly narrowing it down.<br /><br />If I am being vaugue, it is because I really don't want to spoil anything.  Suffice to say, I like mindf--k stories, and found this one to be a very satisfying one.  I didn't know where it was going, and by the end I stopped trying to guess and just enjoyed the ride.  I would suggest this book to people who like a good shake-up of traditional Noir and mystery.<br /><br />Agatha Christie on Hallucinogenics!
0670018651|4.0|Despite his professed dislike of Nabokov, Mr. Turin shares with him a particular talent for scintillating, veracious appraisal, as well as definitive dismissal.  One can have worn and loved Acqua di Parma's \\"Colonia\\" for years and understand that Mr. Turin is right on in his lukewarm appraisal of it.  The author of Lolita held that \\"Style and structure are the essence of a book, great ideas are hogwash.\\"  Turin and Sanchez save their highest praise for perfumes that are artistic and original and consistently poke holes in creations that are middling and bland, yet pleasant.  A perfume like \\"Terre d'Hermes\\" that many find strikingly original is simply \\"harmless\\".  This is a book that will truly make you think about what you smell.  Perfect.
038073186X|5.0|Shutter Island's only inhabitants are the patients in a mental institution and the instution's employees, and Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels was sent to the island to investigate the highly unlikely disappearance of a patient. While on the island Teddy cannot tell if the puzzles he encounters are clues to solving the case or if they are all an elaborate setup to keep him from ever leaving.<br /><br />For a long time I read nothing but mystery/suspense novels because it was only within their pages that...well it was only these books that could challenge me. Some authors in the genre are so good that the books become almost interactive. As the main character tries to sift through the case, I am a puppet on a string. There is nothing better than a good thriller that makes you sit up in bed and talk to yourself while you read. This was that type of book.<br /><br />Dennis Lehane's Mystic River was a pretty good book, but I would not really compare the two. Shutter Island was much more intense and in my humble opinion, a much better book.<br /><br />The book is short and a lightning fast read and my recommendation to you is to read it in as few sittings as possible. Lehane weaves a web of intricate and minute details and fewer sittings will hopefully allow you to enjoy seeing how each detail is important. If you have to, or even prefer to, read the book more slowly, the overall thrill of the book should not be lost on you at all. I really liked this book and I hope someone out there has some suggestions of books like it for me to read.
B000ZLFALS|4.0|My whole family enjoyed this movie. Started watching this movie and did not expect much, but it pulled me in quickly. I ended up buying the CD which we listen to a lot.
B0000640SA|4.0|I give it only four stars because even after watching it three times I'm still fuzy about how to connect the dots. It's nearly impossible to understand the first time you watch it, and you must pay very close attention and piece together scenes to understand it by the time the credits roll. This is also a good thing, though, because you can watch the movie several times without it ever getting old.
0743496736|5.0|The used book was like new except for a couple pages that were still glued together.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Above the likes of Metallica, Kid Rock, System of a Down and many others Green Day triumphs in releasing simply the greatest rock album of the past 10 years. This mixes political satire with a thoughtful and powerful message of how we all must band together as a society. This is very anti-establishment and as Green Day have stated publicly very anti-War on Terror. They live up to their \\"punk\\" label in my eyes as they spread the word of anti-establishment and not believing everything you're told or buying into this media frenzy and this notion of celebrity. Some people will always criticise a successful band such as Green Day, but the fact is they make music that makes us think, and personally I see nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />One of the best songs on the album is Jesus of Suburbia, for a number of different reasons. It is not just a song but more of a story about, well... a Jesus of Suburbia which is simply believed to be the saviour of the rebels of society. The song runs just over 9 minutes long which lead to it being cut down for radio air play. It's literally a short story told in song and it's told in 5 parts.<br /><br />I. \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\"<br />II. \\"City of the Damned\\"<br />III. \\"I Don't Care\\"<br />IV. \\"Dearly Beloved\\"<br />V. \\"Tales of another Broken Home\\"<br /><br />The story is about Jimmy who is the saviour and also known as Saint Jimmy which we see in the video for the song.<br /><br />The most special thing about this album is that is seems to follow an entire story and focuses around this Jimmy character. It's something that is unprecedented in any album I've ever heard and yet seems to go unnoticed by many people.<br /><br />My Top 5 are<br /><br />Jesus of Suburbia<br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams<br />Holiday<br />American Idiot<br />Wake Me up When September Ends<br /><br />Buy this album, you won't be disappointed
B000001EHS|5.0|It's not a surprise that they would call this cd the Def Leppard Vault.  They put most of their greatest songs in there.  I know all the songs and it's hilarious, because I stick it in my cd player in my SUV and sing right along everywhere I go...(when I'm not busy jamming out to Rob Zombie or Nine Inch Nails)  Quite a difference from what I usually listen to, but I grew up with this music.  The leaf doesn't fall far from the tree.
032147404X|5.0|I bought my first SLR camera a month ago.I was looking for a good reference book on how to use it and take full advantage of my camera. THIS is the book; very easy to read understand and practice. Also Scott Kelby is giving amazing tips for any budget So YES digital photography is also for people with limited budget. It is a great book if you are a beginner in SLR photography or a beginner in digital photography in general.
140120306X|1.0|What you have here is just one big mess. I still cant figure out what the whole idea is here. It feels like the story is going along well, then it turns in page after page of Alan Moore just pulling silly League tales and other assorted messes out of thin air. The text ranges from readable to downright blinding in atrociousness. Theres actually pages with no punctuation and no paragraphs, which I'm sure some literary genius finds impressive but to most of us its just a big mess of nonsense.    Moore manages to take the characters and turn them into shadows of themselves in a convoluted mess of a tale that probably amuses some people but will probably turn off and bore half of the fans of the series. Lets face it, there is simply no other explanation for this tale than it being an excuse for Moore to indulge himself with 100s of literary easter eggs that even a well read English Professor would find utterly silly and over the top.     The movie was probably more in kind with the first two novels than this mess of a graphic novel. Its very expensive for what it is and I think anyone who wanted more of the same kind of tales we got in the first two books will be shocked at how far a stretch this is from that. Simply read the positive and glowing reviews here and they are enough to deter you from buying this book. Just listen to some of that utter nonsense and realize that there isn't enough time in your life to do enough drugs or take enough college English classes to find it in yourself to understand or enjoy what Moore did here.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|It has much better coverage of the war in Europe and Russia than American documentaries. However, American documentaries such as \\"War in Europe\\" and \\"War in the Pacific\\" do a more detail job covering the American side of the war. All three of the mentioned documentaries add up to a good library of WW2.
B00154GEFU|5.0|As a follower of all the various forms of Asia over the years, this CD met and exceeded my excitement and expectations from the band.  Asia has had many talented musicians come through their doors, but I fell in love with the band that I heard in the early 80's.  These original 4 members have come to define \\"Asia\\" for me.  Excellent CD, guys, well worthy of the Asia name... and a 25 year wait!
0743486285|5.0|I was introduced to this book when I was buying the Heroin Diaries Soundtrack and decided to buy it at the last minute. Since receiving it I have read it four times and am still enthralled. The story Nikki Sixx has to tell is fascinating and I want to read it again and again. I think this book appeals to many people-those suffering from addiction, and those just wanting a good book to curl up with.
B000001EGA|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of Elton John.  It is nice to have it back in my collection.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great video for beginners all the way up to advanced. It will be especially great for starting out or lower level workouts b/c it starts with an easy 20 minute routine and then allows you to progress to the more advanced 20 minute routines. For really advanced people you could do 2 or all 3 20 minute routines for a hard core workout. Not too hard on the joints and incorporates plenty of ab work within the workout so your not stuck trying to do abs at the end.

B000002OVJ|5.0|The Who was an enigma with a psycho-genius at the song writing front.  In other words, Pete Townshend is well...Pete Townshend.  He is leader, guitar god, poet, drive, focus, chief cook and bottle-washer of one of the truly great rock bands of all time.  They used to hold the Guiness World Record for the loudest concert.  Their music is raw, heavy yet pop-ish, silly and at the same time deeply serious.  They are pure English with some heavy American R&B influence.  John Entwistle (along with John Paul Jones of Led Zep and Jack Bruce of Cream) is the quintessential bassist.  Rogery Daltrey's vocals are phenomenal and are an instrument in it's own rite.  Keith Moon, arguably the best drummer in rock history, is fanatical; playing in series of riffs and is mesmerizing to watch.     This is an excellent live album.  Do NOT be fooled or taken in by bad reviews.  The cd is essential along with the primarly essential 'Who's Next'.
B0009RJVI6|5.0|Wow - this was a riveting book.  While it was quite dark, I loved the author's use of language and her creative twists in the story.  I couldn't put this one down - highly recommend it.
B00000IQW3|4.0|This movie will take you back to the 80's when video games were king and kids couldn't put enough quarters in them.  The movie is pretty good considering the time period.  It has that kind of TRON feel to it, the way most of the Sci-fi movies of the time were.  Overall, I recommend it to add to your collection if your trying to round out your 80's movie collection.
0375842209|5.0|When I started this book I was worried it would be too 'arty' and clever but instead I was introduced to a very tender and realistic novel that is softened by the light relief that is detailed at the beginning of each chapter. Although narrated by 'Death' it is by no means depressing. In fact I found it a very warm and optimistic novel.<br /><br />The story portrays the war from a German point of view, especially the working class Germans who lived on Himmler Street of which Leisel was one. We meet her Papa and Mama, her best friend Rudy, her neighbours, a Jewish man whose father knew her Papa and the Mayor's wife along with a spattering of others along the way. Someone we don't quite meet but who is important to Leisel, is her dead brother (who will always be six). When she needs courage he stands by her and gives her encouragement.<br /><br />Although we encounter the hatefulness that feeds wars. We learn so much more from the people who aren't filled with hate and who value loyalty kindness and humanity.<br /><br />Looking at death from 'Deaths' point of view enables us to see the second world war as we know it, but differently. The concentration camps are mentioned but not focused on. Instead 'Death' tells us...<br /><br />\\"...the sky was the colour of Jews.<br />When the bodies had finished scouring for gaps in the door, their souls rose up. Their fingernails had scratched at the wood and in some cases were nailed into it by the sheer force of desperation, and their spirits came towards me, up into my arms. We climbed out of those shower facilities, onto the roof and up, into eternity's certain breadth.\\"<br /><br />'Death' in this novel reminded me very much of God...or how many of us faced with death or bereavement would like to think of God.<br /><br />I found this book very moving. Even though 'Death' tells us more than once that certain characters will die...when we witness this for ourselves it is no less shocking.<br /><br />A book I strongly recommend, with a strong and interesting story and an intelligent ending.ding.
B0014DBZT2|2.0|I have been a Nick Cave fan since the Boys Next Door.  I wanted to like this.  And I've given myself time for repeated listenings before writing this.  But unfortunately, I just don't Dig it.<br /><br />The first song wouldn't sound too out of place on Grinderman.  It's kind of innocuous but fun.  But on too much of this, the band settles in to a comfortable mid-tempo groove in which it becomes all too apparent that the songwriting is just not up to snuff.  We Call Upon The Author being an exception.<br /><br />Ever since Nocturama and the departure of Blixa from the Bad Seeds, Nick has been on a mission to \\"lighten up\\".  And unfortunately he seems hell-bent on trying to recreate Lou Reed's Walk On The Wild Side by hook or by crook.  There have now been 5 or 6 songs that use that song, along with 88 Lines About 44 Women & All Friends Who Died, as a blueprint.  And it's just not successful, even if the occasional amusing line does pop up.<br /><br />Missing is any of the brutality of songs like The Mercy Seat, Loverman, Oh My Lord, Do You Love Me, et cetera.  Also missing is any of the tender sentimentality of songs like The Ship Song, Straight To You, Are You The One That I've Been Waiting For, et cetera.  Gone too are the unique arrangements that often placed the Bad Seeds far outside the standard rock-type music.  And none of what's missing has been replaced by anything more melodic, catchy, groove-oriented...  it's just middle of the road.<br /><br />It's usually a bad sign when an artist does a \\"concept\\" album.  It usually signals an artistic drought.  Such is the case here, where the story rambles through the entire album, and thus makes the songs very impersonal.  It's a cerebral album with no heart, no soul, and no songs.  Hopefully next time they will Dig deeper.<br /><br />POSTSCRIPT: my fears have been confirmed: Mick Harvey (songwriter, multi-instrumentalist extraordinaire) has left the Bad Seeds.
B0014ERKO0|4.0|Just finished watching the DVD. I have not kept up with the last three season of stargate, so I watched the \\"extra\\" refresher to bring me up to speed. Though there are a few minor \\"roll your eyes\\" moments I was very pleased with the movie. It flowed well, the effects were well done and the ending was satisfying. I am looking forward to the next Stargate DVD. This DVD may have pulled me back into the fold.

0316001821|4.0|The Lovely Bones, written by Alice Sebold, is an astonishing tale about the importance of family and love in a time of pure pain.  It teaches the significance of moving on when it seems almost impossible to do so.  It shows how you can find comfort and stability in your family, even while feeling a sense of complete loss, terror, and anger.<br />When fourteen year old Susie Salmon was brutally raped and murdered by her neighbor, a guiltless serial killer, it sends her family into a downward spiral as their entire world seems to fall apart.  Each of them handles their grief in different ways, some more self-destructive then others.  Susie's father tries extremely hard not to let the pain he feels inside affect his family.  Her mother completely loses it, has an affair, then runs away to California.  Her sister is clearly affected by Susie's death, but doesn't let it define or run her life.  Somehow though, they all help each other to overcome the death, and eventually move on as the happy, strong family they used to be.<br />The most interesting thing about this book is how it's narrated.  As readers we're used to the same old style of books either being narrated by a main character, or the story being told in third person.  What was great about this book was that it was narrated by Susie while she's in heaven.  It's told through her reactions to what she sees going on with her family.  You get to see her reaction to her father falling apart while the rest of the family isn't watching, and how she deals with knowing about her mother's affair.<br />If you want to read a uniquely written book, with great characters and a fantastic plot, then i strongly suggest  The Lovely Bones<br /><br />**If you are easily disturbed by *graphic* novels, SKIP chapter one.

B00110K62U|2.0|Frankly, I found this product can do little but disappoint.  The singing is, of course, superb; however, this is a CONCERT, not a real production.  Seeing the actors standing on a stage in front of microphone can't possibly do the work justice (especially after having seen the musical on Broadway).  Personally, I think purchasing a recording would be far more effective since it won't provide the negative imagery of the characters standing on stage not engaging each other in any meaningful way (not to mention the recordings of this performance can be found at far more reasonable prices).
B000084T18|5.0|I wasn't going to write anything but I'm sorry this album should be no less than a 5. Are you kidding me? This is 50 at his best. This album IS a classic. Yea its gangta so what. He talks about killing and sex and violence and all that but so WHAT! This is hot. This is classic. This is 50 at his hugriest and grimeyest. This is DMX's first album feel me. You can hate 50 as much as you want, but you have to give this album credit for what it is. If a man has been shot 9 times...and his mother was burned alive...or whatever happened to her, what kind of music you expect this man to make? We are the world records? Or intellectual records? Come on cut me a break! This is HARD

0307275639|4.0|Tuesday's With Morrie is a masterpiece written by Mitch Albom. Mitch Albom explains what he thought life's greatest lessons were in the book Tuesday's With Morrie. He tells how his life changed once he started meeting with his favorite old college professor, Morrie Schwartz after he realizes Morrie was diagnosed with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Albom expresses the lessons he was taught in the final class taught by Morrie Schwartz.    Mitch Albom started writing when he became a sports columnist on the Detroit Free Press newspaper. Mitch Albom was a guest on some Detroit radio talk shows that focused on sports. Mitch Albom has also started three charities in the Detroit Area. The three charities include \\"The Dream Fund\\" which helps underprivileged children get involved with the arts, \\"A Time to Help\\" in which volunteers unite to help out with various projects around Detroit and \\"S.A.Y. Detroit\\" which helps fund shelters for the homeless people living in Detroit.   In Tuesday's With Morrie he reveals how his life changed when he revisited his dying professor. Morrie Schwartz was a truly remarkable person. He lived his life the way he wanted to, but still managed to not offend anyone. Morrie Schwartz was a sociology professor at Brandeis University. Being knowledgeable of sociology, Morrie was able to invent aphorisms while lying in his study when he lost control of his legs due to ALS. These aphorisms are what he would teach Albom plus more. Mitch and Morrie had fourteen sessions together in which they conversed about subjects Mitch had overlooked after graduating from Brandeis University. All the subjects Mitch overlooked were topics that many people in today's society fail to notice.  This book explains many life lessons that people need to be reminded of when living their lives. Mitch Albom would record his sessions with Morrie so the details and quotes in the book are exact. If you can accept that even you have overlooked the subjects covered inTuesday's with Morrie, this book should become one of your favorites.
B00005A0V0|5.0|For any Brit who was in his or her teens or twenties in the late 60's/early 70's and who had a discerning ear, this album probably rates very highly.  The two tracks that \\"bring it all back again\\" for me are the title track and \\"Golf Girl.\\"  The \\"Canterbury Sound\\", with its combination of whimsy and serious commitment to art, stands out from the banality of much of the era's popular culture.  Beyond Hastings' and Sinclair's whimsy are engaging melodies that are replete with interesting time signatures supported by subtle harmony.  Although their eponymous first album has a raw creativeness that perhaps surpasses this album, \\"Gray and Pink\\" is perhaps the Caravan album I would choose if I were only allowed one on my desert island.  This is a must have album for afficianados of the \\"Canterbury Sound.\\"
B0013FBS20|3.0|It's okay. Decent character development and action. Worth watching.    Its delivery is a bit bland though. It really doesn't stand out above of the original. As a remake, I was hoping for more vibrance in the characters (especially among the infected who pretty much just come across as generic \\"movie zombies\\") as well as hoping for greater intensity in the plot to describe the struggle to find a cure for the virus.

B000005RFQ|4.0|The first 4 Ozzy albums are heavy metal classics that influenced many of todays rock and metal bands.  the next 3 werent as great, but its hard to meet the standard you set sometimes.  They experimented with new sounds, which was a great idea.  some great tunes but not as good. I am not a big fan of Dio due to his egotistical and self serving ways.  The union of Ian Gillan with Sabbath was brilliant.  allegedly agreed to after a night of serious boozing, Gillan added his killer vocals to the music that made black sabbath the best in the business.  instead of repeating the song reviews, i'll just say that this is a fantastic rock album.  i gave it a 4 instead of a 5, becuase its not Paranoid or Master of Reality.  if this was any other band, it would be a 5.  also, having heard some bootlegs of the tour after this albums release, Gillan sounds downright evil on this material.  Plus he gave spine tingling vocals to Black Sabbath, War Pigs and Iron Man.  Dio's contribution was good, but he couldnt sing the Ozzy stuff.  Gillan could.  and yes, Sabbath closed the shows out with Paranoid giving a segueway into smoke on the water.  i highly recommend this CD.
0452287588|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's New Earth goes far beyond informational, in his own words it is a book about \\"spiritual awakening\\". I found myself so curious and interested about his perspectives and pointers towards awakening and being. Through the pages Tolle provided the keys for me to discover that the voice inside my head is not me and that awareness has been illuminating my days in different ways. Another book that also has transformed me is [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]], Ariel and Shya's short stories have supported me into being and experiencing the miracle of life regardless of the circumstances. Their book opened my eyes to stop identifying with the past and \\"my story\\" where things were stale and gray and to start living truly in the present moment instantaneously, allowing myself to be supported by life in each moment, where life is fresh and new. If you want to discover the freshness of the moment, these two alternatives give you the opportunity to create a magical life right here, right now.
0618918248|5.0|I picked this book up on a bit of a whim. I'd barely heard of Dawkins but I was intrigued. What I found was one of the most exciting, inspirational books I've read in a very long time. Admittedly, my concept of God had already grown very nebulous over time because it had to in order to deal with all the inherent contradictions in my faith. After having to ignore, compromise, downplay and spin so many aspects of my faith it all started to feel a little pointless. But what was the choice? In my family (especially extended family) Atheism was on par with Satanism. Even when I grew older and knew this to be false, the impression was already made and hard to shake off.<br /><br /> The God Delusion was like a stiff breeze that blew the sad little cloud of what was left of my religious beliefs away. And only after did I realize what a heavy burden that cloud was.<br /><br />I'd also recommend checking out the audio book, which is incredibly entertaining to listen to as Dawkins and his co-reader (his wife, talented actress Lalla Ward) are very gifted orators.<br /><br />Perhaps what is the most amazing aspect of the book is that Dawkins is thorough without ever lingering on a subject so long he might lose his audience, but often encourages further reading on subjects should the reader wish to do so. He also explains scientific concepts that-on the face of it-could be considered fairly complex in a straightforward, easily understood way.<br /><br />I think Dawkins does a creditable job of examining what the other side has to say, and debunking their points one after the other. At the end of the day, will this book \\"convert\\" those readers whose beliefs lie firmly entrenched in religious ideologies? Possibly not, because they'll probably be encouraged not too by their religious leaders and peers. It is a shame, because while Dawkins can be very cutting he is always careful to back up his assertions with facts and reasoning.<br /><br />The power of the book, in my estimation, does not lie in its negation of religion-as effective as it is. The truly inspirational part of the book is that Dawkins provides an alternative to religion. Atheism is revealed for what it truly is-far away from the fearful, whispered connotations I grew up with. I think Dawkins makes a great case that a life lived without God cam be just as moral, meaningful and inspiring as one with a God. In fact, it is more so because a true understanding of the brevity of what it is to be a living being means that life needs to be lived as fully as possible. The intricate complexity of the world around us becomes so astonishing as to be moving.<br /><br />I'd consider myself an artist and a creative type first and foremost. But this book has rekindled my interest in science as a whole and has given me a large measure of hope for what the human race might be able to achieve without the superstition of the past and emboldened myself to proudly say that I AM an Atheist.as effective as it is.

B00151HZME|5.0|I bought Saturdays=Youth on the first warm day after a brutal winter and listened to it at work.  Now, I really like my job - but by about the 5th track, it was impossible for me to fight the overwhelming need to spend the rest of the afternoon walking outside aimlessly with headphones on.  That's the best way I can describe the album - the warm synths, great 80s-inspired vocal lines and overall huge sound feel like the first day of spring.  Open up all the windows, blast this and feel awesome.    *I like almost all the songs, but Skin of the Night and Until the Night is Over are my current favorites.

B00005JPTK|4.0|i kind of figured that even for Will Smith being the primary and really only human character.  It might be hard for him to take on but that wasn't the case at all with I Am Legend.  As he plays a viriologist being the only survivor in the city he lives.  There are the ones infected by the virus that basically started because a doctor proclaimed to have a cure for cancer.  But that \\"cure\\" came at a very precious cost wiping out the majority of life all over the planet.<br /><br />While the creatures that he encounters aren't especially frightening (will not after the first couple times at least).  It still manages to create a tension and excitement throughout the movie.  He has a German shepherd that his only real source of compassion and family as something terrible is revealed later on in the movie.<br /><br />While not overly long, I Am Legend managed to keep me interested and watching.  Primarily because of Smith's character and the struggles he goes through with being the only person alive in the city.  He frequents a video store filled with mannequins and carries friendly conversations with me (which could be considered weird).  But i found it kind of quirky all while picking up the next video to watch that helps him pass the time.  The movie holds up throughout and while not as fast paced as the first hour,  i enjoyed the rest of the movie and an ending that leaves all kinds of possibilities for the future.<br /><br />Take an opportunity to watch this and judge for yourself.
B000002BBY|5.0|Very few bands are able to create an album that defines a moment (the Britpop era) in the way that Oasis did with this 1995 near-masterpiece. While it may not be one of the greatest albums of the Rock era, it's hard to imagine how it could not be counted in the top 50!
B00008G9JN|5.0|According to the liner notes, Ian Anderson had just moved out to the English countryside, and was given a book by their manager Jo Lustig on British folklore and legends.  These two events combined to influence Anderson to write a more folksy, rustic, and earthy album \\"Songs From The Wood\\".  To say that this album is good is an understatement, it's phenomenal.  From the opening \\"Songs From The Wood\\" we are prompted to enter this rustic English countryside and partake of the wonders thereby.  \\"Jack-in-the-Green\\" is an ode to the English figure, 9 feet tall and covered with green leaves and flowers, to whom an annual celebration is held in England.  \\"Cup of Wonder\\", while a weaker track still manages to maintain the momentum till we come to \\"Hunting Girl\\", a naughty tale.  \\"Ring Out Solstice Bells\\" became an unusual Christmas song.  \\"Velvet Green\\", in my opinion is the strongest track on the album.  The middle part of this song, with Anderson's darker vocals raises goosebumps, it sounds so good.  \\"The Whistler\\" is a lighter, happier tune and the fife playing by Anderson is awesome.  \\"Pibroch (Cap in Hand)\\" seems to least fit into this album, but it's a good track nonetheless.  The closer \\"Fire At Midnight\\" ends the original album perfectly.  The two bonus tracks \\"Beltane\\" and the live version of \\"Velvet Green\\" are great additions.

0743496736|5.0|After reading My Sister's Keeper, I was very eager to read another one of Jodi Picoult's books.  In Nineteen Minutes, Picoult is trying to portray the horrifying effects of school bullying and happenings that can add up to as tragic an event as a school shooting.  Picoult is trying to make a lasting impression on readers about a catastrophic event and shows how the truth behind it can be surprising.  She gets into the minds of the main characters and how something secretive can be going on right under their nose without them ever knowing.  This book can make any person think.     Jodi Picoult has written many books and is a very popular author.  Nineteen Minutes had a strong impact on the way I think about things, which was one of her goals.  Picoult's goals include providing a common, everyday situation that turns into a nightmare.  She also was trying to give readers a good sense of how situation may appear to be one way but, in reality, be something totally different.     Picoult does an excellent job making readers feel like the characters and the situation is real.  Some mornings I expected to get up and see a story about the Sterling High School Shooting on the news channel on TV.  She also gives us a good idea of who the characters really are and how they really feel about different situations.  The characters were a little bit cliché, but this choice was just to better depict the high school situation and apply a general feeling for who these people might be in our everyday situations.  I know that at the high school I attend, I can think of people who would be the equivalent of Josie, Matt Royston, and even Peter.     This book did drag on a bit in the middle and during some of the parts about the court system.  Some of the readers who did not like this book said that the characters were too cliché and it did not bring anything new to the table.  While I agree that the characters were cliché, it was just to prove the point that this was a normal high school.  In Josie's case, what appears to be might not always be the case.  I really liked how Peter, the monster and murderer, was represented as more of the victim and most of the people that have written reviews feel sorry for Peter.  I think that this book pretty accurately depicts high school life and it is a very good read for adults or teenagers alike.

B000TGELLY|3.0|Judging from the initial reactions of purists, this writer included, many viewers were generally offended by Wolfgang Petersen's 2004 interpretation of the epic tale of Achilles, Hector, and Helen of Troy.  Clearly, it is not Homer, well, not exactly.  But then the various intertwining stories that introduced me to this wonderful tale as told by my Greek grandfather were not pure Homer either.  Petersen took great dramatic license and mixed Homer (not without a good deal of exclusion...the gods and goddesses, numerous characters such as Hecuba and Cassandra) with Virgil and a good deal of Hollywood for his film version of \\"Troy.\\"  Having just viewed the \\"Director's Cut,\\" I must admit that Homeric purity set aside, it works pretty well as a retelling of the tale, despite some alterations in story that simply warrant a shake of the head.  And yes, this cut is better than the theatrical version, certainly more graphic in every sense.  Brad Pitt's Achilles is really remarkable, Eric Bana as Hector is fine, Sean Bean's Odysseus \\"the sacker of cities\\" is first rate, Diane Kruger's Helen worked for me, Peter O'Toole is a heart-rending Priam, and most of the rest of the cast is certainly serviceable.  The production is grand, and even James Horner's last minute replacement score (underrated) works well.  Despite the complaints, Petersen gets some of the scenes just right, especially the \\"fleet footed\\" Achilles both in battle and particularly later in his touching scene with Priam.  And some of his touches from non-Homeric works such as Virgil are quite clever at times.  It all ends with an ironic touch, not the funeral pyre of Hector \\"tamer of horses,\\" but that of Achilles which actually accentuates the point that this is still primarily the story of Achilles, not of Helen of Troy, and this Petersen gets right.  I don't know if \\"The Iliad,\\" \\"The Odyssey,\\" or even \\"The Aeneid\\" can ever be produced adequately on the screen, but this is a worthy effort in hindsight, even if it is not quite a Homeric one.
B000002OZY|5.0|This is the masterpiece in The Who cannon. I know some of you will say Who's Next or Quadrephenia. I could accept arguments for Who's Next, but I still give Tommy the nod because of its ambition and abundance of good melodies and good playing. Quad is way too ambitious to be enjoyable. It is as exhausting to listen to as it must have been to make. Tommy signals the end of the 60's ethos. The hippie thing had become commercialized and enlightenment would have to be pursued individually, not en masse. For the youngsters who don't get it, well, we're gonna leave you behind with the kids are alright!!  You had to be there and if you weren't, this is as close as you'll ever get.

B0009RJVI6|5.0|Well, this is about as good as it gets.  This finely-crafted, intricately-woven novel blew me away.  If you are considering this for a book discussion group, the discussion will be endless...there is so much to talk about.  The author gives the reader all the information on this \\"problem child\\" and then allows the reader to draw their own conclusion, including the possibility that there is no definitive conclusion.  The author's ability in this book boggles the mind.
B000002B1M|4.0|I remember the first time I saw the video for \\"If I Ruled The World\\". The beginning of that video has a scene where Nas and Cormega are sitting in a sick S-Class Benz in front of the projects in Queens. In the background I noticed a beautiful \\"spanish\\" guitar arrangement that I just knew would be on the album.    At that very moment I thought, \\"Illmatic 2\\". I just knew it would be the second coming, but it turned out to be something different. Not in a bad way, just different.    The album starts out in classic Nas fashion, respecting the past, specifically, the trials of his ancestors, but it doesn't come off the way he intended it to. All in all, it was awkward, but hey, it's all good.  Next up is \\" The Message\\". I think the beat is absolutely bananas and the lyrics are solid, but what disturbed is the way Nas begins to delve into this shootout scenario towards the end of the song. That was never really his M.O., but it was standard fare for the times, so I could dig it.    Nas then plays into the mafioso lifestyle in full with \\"Street Dreams\\". He did it just as well as Raekwon would have, but this song has never been one of my favorites. \\" I Gave You Power\\" reunites Nas and DJ Premier. This song is still dope to this day as Nas describes another day in the life of a gun. As a metaphor driven composition, this is probably the best song I have ever heard. \\"Watch Dem\\" is pretty good and the message is simple. Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer...    The next few songs are decent, but none of them are home runs. Nas caught a lot of flack for \\"Nas Is Coming\\", but he went out on a limb rhyming over a West Coast beat provided by Dr. Dre in the middle of the East/West turf war, when in reality, he should have been commended. \\" Affirmative Action \\" was a very good posse cut until Foxy failed miserably in her attempts to explain drug mathematics to the world.    \\"Black Girl Lost\\" was an excellent track in which Nas points out the traps set for women who try to live the fast life. JoJo from Jodeci adds some dimension to the song with good effect. \\"Suspect\\" and \\"Shootouts\\" were good, but I have feeling that the production let him down a little. Also, it was reported that Method Man was supposed to be on the latter, which I am sure would have been a winning combination. \\" Live N Rap\\" was just Nas and Mobb Deep getting busy on a track.     The album ends with\\" If I Ruled The World\\" featuring Lauryn Hill. Nas really caught some criticism from the purists for this one, but Nas still delivers some strong messages, something that you would NEVER hear on the radio today unless it was Common, and only Common.     All in all, this is a 4 star album because Nas spreads himself a little thin in terms of the image he attempts to portray and because the production sometimes did not match his incredible rhyme cadence. Still a good album to cop though.
0517147688|5.0|What a DELIGHTFUL anthology of all Jane Austen's novels! I was especially impressed with the beautifully embossed midnight blue and gold leather binding of this edition, gilded pages, and the sewn in ribbon book mark. This certainly is a worthwhile addition to anyone's library. In fact, I've already recommended it highly to several other people. (This is precisely the new volume Grigg purchased in the hit film \\"The Jane Austen Book Club\\"!)<br /><br />Included as a bonus are the original pen and ink illustrations charmingly rendered by Hugh Thomson, which are both witty and expertly drawn. They capture the essence of the time period and the stories superbly. In addition to all six well-loved Jane Austen novels, the lesser-known \\"Lady Susan\\" is also present in this comprehensive volume. To purchase this entire edition, with high quality paper and such a beautiful binding for under $20.00 is unbelievable! By all means, purchase a copy immediately for any Jane Austen lover you know. They will treasure this volume forever![[ASIN:0517147688 Jane Austen: The Complete Novels, Deluxe Edition (Library of Literary Classics)]]!
0671799320|5.0|This is a great book, period!  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this history of the oil industry.  It shows the incredible power of Oil, the primary reason we have grown and become so affluent as a country....imagine a world without Oil...where would you be?  Should be considered required material in high school so that all students learn about a very important aspect to their daily lives.  I work in the oil industry and I learned a few things about my industry.  I try to read everything written by Daniel Yergin, including his Russia 2010 and The Commanding Heights, exceptional writer.
0743298039|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield is a treasure of a book on so many levels. The language is wonderful and engaging - detailed and specific. Each main character, Margaret Lea and Vida Winter grow throughout the story, becoming more open and more engaged to each other. The secrets in the story are so creative and fascinating. The primary focus of the importance and value of books is a treat for those of us who decorate heavily with bookshelves!! I just loved this book.
B000VECAC6|5.0|The life of Brian - blu-ray, is the clearest and near ost complete version of the film I've ever seen. I'm not going to review LOB here, since it is a true classic. I will, however, point outy that DVD has included the reading of the script by the cast they performed back in 1977; his alone is worth the price of the dvd. Also included are the radio ads that ran on the BBC back in the day - wonderful as well. The movie, itself is perfectly clear - obviously cleaned up and remastered for this effort. I've noticed dtails (and sounds) I hadn't in other reditions.  Buy this bu-ray by all means.
B000W00Y0Y|4.0|This is one of the best sound in a disc, from a group that made hystory!

B0011HOEY4|5.0|Great real life, old school, gangster. I really enjoyed this movie and the story line from beginning to end. If you like movies like \\"Blow\\" you will enjoy this one as well.
0810994739|5.0|My son loves this book.  I always have him read 30 minutes each night before bed.  Every night I have to remind him to read and after he starts reading he asks if his times up every 5 to 10 minutes.  With this book he asks me if he can read now and when I tell him times up, he asks if he can read for a few more minutes.  There are two books in this series and he loves both.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I don't write many reviews and they are always short but the editorial review posted for this alum is just not right.  John Mayer is a genius and to have that text come up everytime searches out this album on Amazon, well it's very misleading and wrong.  The album is unbelievable but the only way to know this is to gamble your $10 and find out for yourself.  Then you can move on to the other greats like side two of \\"Any Given Thursday\\" (breathtaking) and of course, \\"Heavier things\\" and \\"Continuum\\" - both fantastic!!
B00005JPSM|3.0|Hmmmm....I went to see this movie at the movies because of its rating. Big mistake. The language was a bit off for a pg rating! The romance just wasn't there. It was a silly movie with no depth. What were the characters thinking? It just felt like they threw this movie together. I think it could have been WAY better.
B000Y179KO|1.0|I listened to both CDs at a friend's house and heard one good song....How Long.  Not worth buying the whole thing so I went home and downloaded the song from LimeWire.  Thanks for the freebie, Donny!
B0010ZR160|3.0|I liked the story. It was very interesting and had lots of potential.It could have been a WHOLE lot better without all the bad language! The acting was okay but nothing great.<br /><br />The premise of the movie makes you think and rethink and question things about parenthood.  A child is kidnapped and drowned but that is only the beginning of this story. The twist that developes is inescapable.<br /><br />I can't recommend it for every one because it has such bad language.
B0017M413M|5.0|I love Stargate the TV show so it is no suprise I liked the movie. I was a little bit worried it might not be very good because not all TV shows have made great movies. I felt that if you have been watching the seires this movie really answered a lot of the unfinished plot left over from the show. I am sad that it had to be a hour and a half movie instead of a 11 season but the fact that they got a two movie deal helps make the end of a great series less of a bumber.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|I have found this series spellbinding. I don't agree at all with reviews that say this is 'not real life'. I think it really delves into and exposes the relationships between men and women and the importance of every person's relationship with their parents. I say it is spellbinding. I don't deny that some of it is 'over the top'. Such as Alex delving into Paul's private life and Paul not kicking him out and refusing to treat him anymore. Alex acted psychotic. But besides some perhaps 'unreal' things about the series, it IS a Drama! We are Supposed to be interested!     I think this drama succeeds on all kinds of levels: Acting, writing, complexity of characters,love, yearning, complexity of friendships. It does this Much More than most any TV drama has done so far.
0446401307|4.0|There is no such thing as a bad Michael Connelly novel. The Overlook does nothing to change that fact. Harry Bosch is once again the central character & FBI agent Rachel Walling is around again. The novel is shorter than most of M. Connelly's, mostly due to the fact that it was serialized in the \\"New York Times Magazine\\". Actually this may be a good thing, the pace is fast & there's not a single slow moment in the story.    The story involves a murder of a man that has access to cesium, a radioactive material that's used to treat some types of cancer. It's dangerous stuff, though, when not used properly. Because cesium is a radioactive material & could possibly be used to create a dirty bomb, not to mention that the victim was on a watch-list, the FBI gets involved because it's viewed as a possible terrorist activity. Inadvertently, Bosch & Walling are brought back together on the case but their last experience (Echo Park) left them bitter & disillusioned with the other. The FBI views the case as a heist, their main concern is to recover the cesium & get the terrorists. Bosch views it as a murder investigation & therein lies the conflict of the story.    This is a very good book in the Harry Bosch series. If you haven't read any of those you're in for a treat. Though it's not necessary, I would recommend reading the books in order of release (duh).
1428166556|4.0|Very interesting subject and worth reading, although the not especially well written and the author gets arrogant and annoying at times.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|This is a great series. Only downside is the lack of bonus features. Overall the quality is great (although some parts are better than others) and the content is amazing.
B000YABYLA|3.0|I bowed to public pressure and bought \\"Juno\\" when it came out on DVD.  I watched it last night and today am marveling over the fact that something could make me hate Jason Bateman.      He was very poorly cast in this movie.  So was Jennifer Garner, as a matter of fact.  I was not impressed with any of the characters, except Juno's best friend.  Isn't it sad that she was the only character I really liked?  She seemed realistically witty, not forced comedy like the other people seemd to have.  Like many of the people who rated this movie below 5 stars, I felt the dialog was forced, and not at all realistic of a 16 year old's.  I am 37 and I found that some of the things they talked about were more from my era, not from someone young enough to be my daughter.    I would suggest just borrowing this movie if you want to see it.  Don't spend the $15.99 at Target to buy it.  I probably won't watch it again.
0670018651|5.0|Tired of wasting money on over-rated perfumes? Ignore the flashy ads and buy this book! A quick and accurate education: what makes a scent a classic; what is \\"quality\\" in perfume; what are the ingredients and how do they react in the bottle and on the skin?   Not to be missed - as much as for the information as for the writing! Hilarious, laugh out loud, and dead-on in most cases (I admit I tend to agree with LT moreso than TS...). An absolute pleasure to read!   Buyer beware: you may be inspired to go on a perfume spree!
0321544080|5.0|The Moment It Clicks is about how a great magazine photographer makes pictures, about light and lighting on location, and about what makes a picture great. It is also about the photographer's need to take better pictures, to show them, and to have people appreciate them.    Joe McNally writes about asking publishers for assignments, and then about being  asked to take assignments for magazines including Sports Illustrate, National Geographic and Life. The outstanding pictures in the book are accompanied by the interesting story of how it happened and what made this image great.     This is supposed to be for intermediate photographers. I believe the more professional you are, the more you will get out of it, and at the same time a beginner will find it interesting and inspiring.    Scott Kelby urged Joe McNally to write this book after attending some of his classes. Each lesson contained one sentence, one thought, that the moment it clicked made the whole lesson worth whatever it cost, and suggested the title.     The Moment It Clicks is a coffee table book and a joy to read. Each story about a photograph contains that one sentence, The Moment It Clicks. Then there are other  stories for you t enjoy about being a photographer.
B00004SCS1|4.0|this album is the kind of cd you can annoy your neighbors with and enjoy it. its got interesting guitar riffs and a signature sound not many bands can match. my favorites are suite-pee, sugar, suggestions, spiders, war, darts, and PLUCK. enjoy this classic album. i sure did (even though it took a few years).
0307275639|4.0|I had been given multiple recommendations from friends and family to read this simple, but heartwarming book, and I didn't decide to sit down and read it until recently.  The author decided to take his career as a sports writer, and use his writing to tell the words of an inspiring man.  Mitch Abom wrote sports highlights in the Detroit Free Press, and tried to write novels about sports instead.  After not becoming successful with his first few novels, he decided to try a different type of book.    Tuesdays With Morrie is  about Morrie Schwartz, a retired history professor at Brandeis University who is dying of ALS, which is more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Diesase.  A former student of his named Mitch Albom hadn't seen his old professor in years but he saw the old man on Nightline.  Albom decided to visit Morrie.  After a few visits, Morrie and Mitch decided to meet every Tuesday to discuss the meaning of life and how to embrace life.  More specific things like family and love were discussed and to be honest, hearing a dying man say such things was a little depressing.  However, the morals that Morrie taught made me think more about life and how to live it to its fullest.  In reading this book (which was a quick read by the way) I learned an interesting viewpoint on life.  Considering the fact that the book is about a dying man, you can figure out how it ends, but it surely finishes strong, and with a powerful message.  The writing was easy to understand, but at times, the book became tedious and depressing.  Overall, the message overweighed the depressing parts of the book.    Tuesdays with Morrie was published ten years ago, yet it was a multiple award winning novel.  The story of Morrie Schwartz has been and will continue to be remembered by many.

B0015HS5TA|4.0|***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br /><br />Amy Adams ([[ASIN:B0011U52EC Enchanted]]) is becoming a powerhouse actress. From her earliest work in [[ASIN:0780628306 Drop Dead Gorgeous]] to [[ASIN:B000BYRCQU Junebug]] and now here in MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY, Ms. Adams' excellent character pieces leap off the screen. This is pretty ironic for Miss Pettigrew, as Ms. Adams is not the title character, yet shines brighter than any other actor or actress in the film.<br /><br />Amy Adams plays Delysia Lafosse, a wannabe stage and screen star living in pre-WWII London. But this isn't where our story starts. It starts with Miss Guinevere Pettigrew (Frances McDorman, [[ASIN:B000EOTAM6 Aeon Flux]]) who loses her job as a nanny and comes calling on Delysia (Adams) even though Miss Pettigrew's agency never sent her. In fact, Miss Pettigrew is a bit desperate for a job and thieves a note from her boss' desk that allows her access to Delysia. And as soon as Delysia and Miss Pettigrew meet, the comical clashes and subterfuges begin.<br /><br />Delysia is a bit loose with her sexuality and this becomes Miss Pettigrew's first \\"job\\" as her new \\"social secretary.\\" Deflecting boyfriends, lovers, producers, and the owner of the flat where Delysia now lives occurs in rapid-fire succession.<br /><br />Delysia's entire motivation behind her sexual exploits, however, are aimed at procuring her lead spot in a new play being put on by the son of a successful playwright named Phil Goodman (Tom Payne V). But in her way is love, true love, with a man of very little means named Michael Pardue (Lee Pace, [[ASIN:B000MXPE7O The Good Shepherd]]). The battle between business success and personal fulfillment cause the greatest uproar. And Miss Pettigrew is in the middle of all of it. But not just for Delysia. Miss Pettigrew has a love of her own that surprises her with the name of Joe Blumfield (Ciaran Hinds, [[ASIN:B000F1IQN2 Munich]]), an important clothes designer in England who tires of the deceptive lives surrounding him and yearns for something real.<br /><br />Although Frances McDormand plays the title character, it is Amy Adams who pulls this story along, and makes you laugh, cry, and generally involved. Her upbeat and giddy performance makes the entire film watchable. The other actors and actress are `okay' but never come up to her level.<br /><br />The other bonus for the film is that the period is well represented. The costumes, cars, buildings and sets easily harken one back to the 1930s. The undercurrent of the impending war is also felt quite nicely as London prepares its air-raid sirens and launches waves of airplanes for training.rns for something real.

0307341550|3.0|Camille Preaker is a fragile being. She's like a three-legged chair trying to keep its balance, and barely managing to do so. Then, she's asked by her editor (and unspoken surrogate father) to return to her small town, the source of her fragility, fear, scars, and demons, to hunt down the story behind the deaths of two girls. What she encounters are lots of people she doesn't like, including members of her own family. She's suggestible to manipulation, craves love, but friendly attention will do, but mostly wants to please her boss.<br />The author mocks small town life to create the dark, nasty, vindictive and secrets-bound environment which helps create the story's suspense. The antipathy Camille opines about almost all of the people led me to almost stop reading the novel, so much of downer about human beings, their motives, and behavior it depicted.<br />The story is a sad one: of the boredoms, and petty, and not-so-petty  cruelties, of small town existence. It's also sad in its depiction of cruel, harried and ignorant parenting.<br />Ms. Flynn wrote a tale of sharp pictures and scenes, a sympathetic protagonist, and of love turned dark, ugly, warped, or in little evidence.<br />The story's last sentence feels like it was added to leave the reader questionably uplifted.<br />And, I will look for Ms. Flynn's next novel. She's got a gift, but one that shows more potential than what shows up in this novel.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|When I first saw this most recently released Bond, I felt that the first third was silly, and that Daniel Craig was adequate in the roll.  But that overall it was a pretty good action movie.  On a whim, and because of a great price, I decided to buy the DVD--and was astounded by how much I enjoyed it.  I still think the chase scene at the beginning is silly, but fun; but the rest of the film really engaged me.  I believe the producers have made a very wise choice in both Daniel Craig, and how Bond is updated.  The old bond seems as dated as watching the original Rat Pack in some of their films--- fun, and certainly reflective of the time, but very dated.  I'm actually looking forward to picking up the story in the next outing!    Even if you're less than enthusiastic about the Bond franchise, give this one a shot.
B000VWYJ8Q|4.0|I am glad that HD DVD lost the HD format war. The HD DVD combo format was such a flop that I cannot understand why Universal and Warner continued to issue then. The only reason I bought this US combo version and not the UK non-combo version was the fact that the US version had a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack. I have seen this movie a lot and the movie freezes at almost the exact same place, around 1:27 when the bad guys are chasing Bourne in the parking lot, and I am getting tired of it.    However, the movie itself is simply amazing. I didn't like it at all when I saw it in the theater. I think it was because I sat too close to the screen. This HD DVD version is so good (other than the horrible combo stuff described above). The picture and sound is really great. I have come not to like too much the computer manipulated colors on various other releases, like Spider-man 3 and the latest Harry Potter. The natural colors and saturation on this release is so great, full of detail. The sound is equally great with really good dynamics and space created by my five speakers. It is a very engaging sountrack, the basses are deep and the details are clear.    I haven't returned this because I know that all combo format HD DVDs are the same (I have the same experience with American Gangster, which I bought in a local shop where I live, and am considering buying the UK version to get a non combo version) and I can get around it with some fast rewind. What seems to work when the movie freezes is to rewind a couple of seconds and play the sequence again. Ever so often the playback continues past the point it froze. Like I wrote above is this the only version with Dolby TrueHD, so I have chosen to keep it.  Anyone considering buying this version should consider buying the UK version instead if the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack isn't that important to you.
0753820250|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind was a book I randomly picked up ages ago. I have no idea what drew me to it, but I recently discovered it on my shelf, took it down and figured I'd actually read it. By the time I turned to page two, I knew I was in for a treat.  I can only read in English, so I have no idea if the original Spanish is as elegant as the translation, but I was immediately wrapped in language so wonderful that even if the story had turned out to be mundane, I knew the experience of reading the book would be a delight.  In the end, the story captured my imagination to such an extent I could hardly put the novel down to take care of the daily things one needs to take care of.  I found myself wandering off into day dreams thinking about the characters I'd left on my table at home. I pondered where the story could go. I marveled at each unexpected plot turn.  Finally I finished the book, closed it and, unbelievably, I wept.  Something about the story, the language and the experience of reading this book so took hold of me that I was emotionally drained upon closing it for the final time.  Pick up this book.  It is a rare treat.
B000GW8OAA|4.0|This a fun movie for anyone who enjoys car racing and the import tuner culture. While there is some misinformation and some of the lines are very cheesy, the movie is still fun and by far the best in the F&F series. The HD-DVD version looks stunning and the audio is also excellent. A \\"guilty pleasure\\" as some other reviewers have stated and I have to agree.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|One of the best movies ever. Now that it's on Blu-ray makes it even better. Amazon was one of the first to sell this movie.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I consider myself a Star Trek viewer rather than fan (though I actually started watching the original Star Trek series way back in its first run in the mid-60's).  The only one I haven't seen except in passing is Voyager, so my opinion doesn't include that one.  The things I personally liked about the Star Trek series (again, as a viewer, not a die-hard fan), I found in greater abundance in the Enterprise series.  So, even though I've already seen almost every episode of Enterprise in the current ScFi go-around, I bought all four seasons anyway. One of the episodes in season 3 - Similitude - was, in my opinion, the best Star Trek episode of all the Star Trek series.  It's even a shade above The Inner Light from TNG, which up until I saw Similitude was my all-time favorite.  Both of these magnificent episodes focused, not on special effects or any other specifically sci-fi aspect, but on the purely human aspects.  As such, I would stand these two episodes alongside any episodes from any series I've ever seen.  If for no other reason than Similitude, Enterprise is a great series, with the most \\"life-like\\" characters of any of the Star Trek series.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|My kids and I have tons of fun watching this movie over and over again, despite my wife's puzzled objections over the slapstick style.  Stephen Chow is a genius, and literally does it all - running the gamut from directing a hodge-podge of action, comedy, musical, period piece and even romance, to being the star of the show.  The pacing reminds me of James Cameron's directing, with never a dull moment.  The Hong Kong style action is awesome and beautifully choreographed.  The comedy, albeit slapstick and dependent on high school level humor, nevertheless tickles our collective funny bone (again with the exception of the wifey). We especially love the sequence where Bone, the sidekick, keeps stabbing Sing in Pigsty Alley in a comedy of errors, and Sing ends up running from the Landlady a la Road Runner, using the knives stuck in his shoulders as sideview mirrors. Those who liked \\"Shaolin Soccer\\" are definitely in for a treat.      Feature-wise, the blu-ray disc is loaded with content, including a revealing interview with Chow.  You'll get a kick watching the movie in the original Chinese and reading the subtitles, since the translation was not exact in the English version.  Picture and audio quality are adequate and are slightly superior to the DVD counterpart.    I hope Mr. Chow never gets corrupted by Hollywood, and continues to churn out more movies like this gem.
0143038419|3.0|I read the book based on a friend's recommendation. I'm glad I read it before seeing the reviews. All the \\"negative\\" reviews are right: the book is self-centered. BUT, I think the point was missed by the readers.  It plainly states that it's about One Woman's Search; if you were disappointed, it's your own fault. This is NOT a self-help book or instruction manual on how to live vicariously through Gilbert in order to find your own self-awareness. It's a book of entertainment. I'm actually buying it for all my girlfriends so they can learn it's ok to be unsure, to be irrational, and to laugh at yourself. That's something you can get out of this book.
0684847248|5.0|I have accidently found this book and read it, This is an extraordinary book with great insight on the Life, conscience growth and Love. If you haven;t read this then you are missing lot of great insight which has been provided in the book. 5 star from my side
B0000AQS0F|5.0|firefly is just one of those shows that got killed off before its time.  The studio never really gave it a fair shake, in my opinion.  The DVDs are well presented, play fantastically, and the special features are nice.  I wish there was more to it, of course, as I'm a big fan of the show.  The menus load a little slowly, but that's the only real downside to the set.    Show: Perfect  DVDs: Great.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Would purchase CD again from Vendor - quick service and CD was in wrapping - never used....
B00009AOBI|5.0|the movie was new, and in mint condition. they mailed to me and i got it in three days using just the regular shipping.
B000UR9T82|3.0|...since the movies in the trilogy deserve their own reviews and have been done to death already.  The low cost (even lower by $10 since I bought it) is what motivated me to buy this blu-ray disc set.  I already have the special editions of all three Spiderman movies on DVD, so I wanted to see what blu-ray would bring to the home theater table, having recently bought a PS3.  True, the picture quality is awesome and the audio certainly will blow you away.  However, there are hardly any special features - only the third disc has any to speak of.  This is an underwhelming effort, considering the massive amount of space availalble on blu-ray discs. Compare, for example, the featurettes and even mini-movies on \\"I Am Legend\\".      One thing I discovered about audio selection: if you choose PCM and your receiver is not capable of processing uncompressed signals (my Onkyo only does HDMI pass-through), all you'll get is simulated surround (e.g. Dolby ProLogic).  So I ended up with 5.1 and although it may not be true HD, it's good enough for my 7.1 setup.  But if you're an audiophile you would have known about this already.      My summary - HD picture quality: a strong 4 stars, audio quality and options: 4 stars, special features: a dismal 1 star - hence the overall 3 star rating.  I guess for the price, this set is not too bad, but considering the wealth of possibilities for the Spiderman franchise, it fell short of my expectations.
B00005JPTK|5.0|I just finished watching the alternate version of I Am Legend. I have yet to see the theatrical version, and have had severe reticence in doing so. I am an avid fan of the original novel and felt through descriptions of friends who have seen the movie that this was so far from the novel, it should not have been given the same name. I heard slightly better things about the alternate version and have just learned otherwise. I am a fan of the movie, but the movie in its own right, as its own story, not in relation to the novel. I am also now eager to see the theatrical movie, and hope to find it as thoughtful and humane as the alternate version, because to me I Am Legend isn't just some zombie killing spree its a story with vivid imagination and inspiration to go outside the traditional lore of zombie-vampire creatures and enters you into a world of new-found deviation from traditional mythos. The alternate movie did, in its own right, have a similar feeling. If the theatrical version has a similar feeling with its different storyline, I will find myself to be entirely pleased with a trio of Legends to remember.    The 'hits' and 'misses' have already been stressed by so many people, but I've only seen in one review so far the perfect description for what the alternate version of the movie really succeeded at, even though it is almost entirely separated from the core plot lines of the original novel, it does such a great job of capturing the feeling. While fans of the novel will surely be disappointed if looking for a direct adaptation, and many newcomers to the story may be disappointed by the monsters themselves, the movie, through lead actor Will Smith, portrays such depth of feeling that one cannot fault it for its break from its predecessors. It just needs to be taken out of context of the original, watch it as if it was a brand new story. Then, if you haven't, read the book. It is a story to remember.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This is a really well presented set.  The box is awesome, to begin with.  The menus are simple and load in the blink of an eye.  The presentation looks great, sound is good, picture is top notch.  The extras are pretty extensive and there is new stuff over the previous releases.    Recommended for any Serenity, SciFi or Western Fan.

B000WO251Q|5.0|This book is a must have, must read, hard to put down book because you want to know what happens next. Come on now Nicholas Sparks is the MAN what an amazing author I can't imagine giving his books anything less than 5 stars. Dear John, The Notebook, The Wedding, The Choice, True Believer... I recommend any book by Nicholas Sparks.
0753820250|2.0|Aside from the obvious Marquez rip-offs and the heavy-handed purple prose (lots and lots of shadows, mists and blown-out candles), this novel also suffers from extraordinarily shallow characterizations. Is it a parody of a (bad) gothic novel? But there's no real irony going on that I detected. For all the plot intricacies, I still struggled to finish it. Why oh why is every female such a flimsy (though, of course, exquisite) shell? And why is the villain so very very thoroughly demonically evil so as to be silly? Finally: I thought this was supposed to be about \\"the power of books\\" -- but it was more about a young man's obsession with the mysterious author of a rare book, which is a very important distinction. Very little in this novel made me think about literature, aside from the cutesy flourishes the author brought in to prove he is well-read (a cat named Kurtz, for example, and a boorish boyfriend named Buendia).
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is an awesome workout...three awesome workouts.  They get progressively more difficult and higher impact as you progress.  The level three workout is just a wonderful workout.  I end up doing more than one to get a full workout for they day and I feel great after finishing, by great I mean sweating like crazy and my muscles are quite sore.  Definitely worth purchasing.
1416955070|3.0|I really struggled to get into this book for the first half but I was determined to make it through and give it a fair shake. There were some issues with pacing, the dialog often didn't flow naturally (seemed forced at times, unrealistic at others), and the prose itself was often oddly worded - strange metaphors and similes that made me do double-takes and re-read because they just sounded weird.<br /><br />However, I'm glad I stuck with it because I enjoyed the last half more than the first. The character interaction didn't seem as stilted and I liked the character of Simon quite a bit, though the protagonist, Clary, could use more development. I never felt like I had a clear grasp on who she was and some of her actions made no sense to me (like when she slapped Jace I was like \\"what?\\" \\"hunh?\\" Where did that come from? I can't see many 15-yr-olds doing that). Jace's constant arrogance and snarkiness got on my nerves in the beginning but it seemed to mellow out as the story progressed and then made more sense as details of his past emerged.<br /><br />I saw parallels and overlaps with stories such as Star Wars (as other reviewers have pointed out) but they didn't bother me. Being a huge Star Wars fan myself, it was kind of nice in way to see a few similar themes played out. I understand why other people would be bothered by that but I didn't mind.<br /><br />And I suspect the big \\"twist\\" at the end is a red herring but only the sequels will tell.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a decent first novel. Not mindblowing but it shows promise and I did see an evolution in the writing from the beginning to the end. Or maybe I just got used to her style - I'm not sure. I will read City of Ashes and hope to see the author progress in her craft. I always want to see new writers succeed.
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle was an intriguing and thought-provoking book, but it was rather dark.  Throughout this book, author Kurt Vonnegut shows his morbid view of the world, including a dystopia and a ninth ring of hell.  The story is about how the narrator, an author who is writing a book about the atomic bomb, meets the children of one of the scientists who helped build the atomic bomb.  Little does the author know that the scientist had created something much more dangerous than the atomic bomb.  His fate becomes entwined with the children, a midget, an introspective genius model builder, and a clarinet prodigy, and he witnesses the end of the world as the powerful weapon, ice nine, freezes all the water in the world.    Vonnegut comes up with brilliant ideas as well as sneaking in his own advice on living through the holy man Bokonon, whose self titled religion has poems, songs, and scriptures throughout the book.  The author vividly shows his prediction of the future in this book, and through his eyes, there is no hope for mankind.  As a warning, this book might disturb more sensitive readers and is most definitely not a children's book.  Also, Vonnegut has the bad habit of going off on a tangent that is not always necessary.  Vonnegut uses the narrator/author named John as a representative for himself, such as both of them went to Cornell College and were members of the Delta Upsilon fraternity.    Kurt Vonnegut was a soldier and prisoner of war in World War 2, and was one of the survivors of the Dresden bombing, which was the theme for his other book, Slaughterhouse-Five.  His mother also committed suicide on mother's day when he was 22, which might have helped give his writing the macabre twang it has.

0670034711|3.0|The vicious condemnation of this book's author by so many reviewers reminded me of the Salem Witch Trials where innocent people burned at the stake for imaginary crimes.  That was 1692 and this is, what, 2008?      I ask: if you hated this book so vehemently and are distraught about the time and money wasted on it, why spend more of your presumably valuable time writing a savage attack?  To quote Shakespeare: methinks the lady (or possibly man) doth protest too much.  There must have been something else that rankled you. I'm guessing it wasn't Elizabeth Gilbert's style (which is charming), or her writing ability (which she clearly possesses), or her intelligence (which she aptly demonstrates).  I'm guessing it's because--like those rebellious women in 1692--she dared to step out of the crowd and take the road less traveled.  She dared to be the main character of her story instead of someone's sidekick! She dared to leave a husband whom she felt was suffocating her! She dared to travel around the world in search of herself!      Where does it say that a woman is not entitled to be self-seeking and spend her time developing herself?  Where is it inscribed that if a woman doesn't marry and have kids she has to be a nun or act like Mother Teresa?  Why can't it be okay for a woman to be Calamity Jane?  (It certainly was okay with her.) If a man is single and self-seeking, he's an entrepreneur, a bachelor, an eccentric, or at the very worst, a recluse.  Why is it that women are seen as evil or selfish if they are not somebody's helpmate?  Pardon me for saying so, but that is so 1692.    Virginia Woolf wrote last century about a woman's need to have some place away from the constant demands of being wife and mother, a space, physical and temporal, where she could put all her attention on developing her self and her talents.  She eventually had her own room; perhaps it was the melancholy that occupied too much space in her head that caused her to fill her coat pockets withstones and drown herself in the river.      Women are lucky enough in this age--especially for those who live in places like New York City--to be able march to a different drummer, and we do--vibrantly, deliciously, exuberantly.  Each woman should be free to choose whatever life she wants for herself without fear that someone else--especially another woman--will attack her choice as subversive, narcissistic, and selfish or, on the flip side, ordinary, boring, and predicable.     When I was 13, I anguished about not fitting in; I felt like a freak and a loner.  Luckily I found Ralph Waldo Emerson's \\"Self-Reliance\\" where he exhorts those with courage to march to a different drummer. Without thinking I chose to cultivate my individuality; my expression and opinions were based on personal choice rather than societal obligation. But Emerson's warning---that the price of non-conformity is hostile retribution--was chillingly prophetic. Somehow I braved the heat I got.  It's a sad commentary that in a nation created by rebels breaking away from the pack, we crucify those who do not conform.  But for those of us who don't care, or are courageous enough, the price we pay is small compared to the rich lives we discover off the beaten path.    Elizabeth Gilbert's book did not promise to cure cancer, end world hunger, or uplift all the unfortunate people in the world.  It was her account of trying to find relief from her misery.  Misery does not have be on the level of genocide to be authentic or horrific--it can be a crippling bout of depression. (For those unacquainted with it, read William Styron's \\"Darkness Visible\\".)  She admits to being addicted to men.  For that she should be drawn and quartered?  Shouldn't she be given some credit for her awareness and the desire to change her behavior?  Should she have worked in a sweat shop for 10 years to deserve a trip around the world?  For those tear-down experts out there--and there are a nation full of them--consider building something positive instead of pouring gasoline on what's already a raging fire.

0783226888|4.0|Bruce Willis as a bad guy? Yuppers! Bruce drops his, \\"Die Hard\\" hero hat and becomes a totally cold-hearted hitman known as, \\"The Jackal\\". Bruce is a really creepy, cunning assassin that few people have ever seen and live to tell about it.  Richard Gere, playing an former IRA terrorist who is now in prison, is one of those rare people who can recognize the Jackal.  He cuts a deal with the FBI to help find the Jackal before he kills an important, unknown ( so far ) target.  Jack Black also stars as a techno-geek with great weapon building skills who meets a rather grisly end at the Jackal's hands. This movie had me guessing continuously as to who was the Jackal's target, ( I was way off when I found out ) and the action and suspense had me hooked. I enjoyed it very much.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|I don't know if the one disk version has the same quality as two disk version. From my eye the one disk version has low image quality. The first disk I received stopped at chapter 23. I found a black ink on the disk, and it's not removable. The second disk I received had a black dot on the disk also! I had to use my lens brush to clean it up.
B0012K1ILW|1.0|I usuallly listen to Ms. Badu and enjoy her music.  I struggled to understand what her intentions were behind this piece.  I will listen to it again, and hopefully enjoy it.
B00005QAPH|5.0|I remember a time around jr. high school when there was a spate of kids writing homework papers about how they couldn't write the paper. They always had a ring of authenticity and sometimes some humor but usually very little else.  This movie is about a film director who is making a movie about not being able to make a movie.  The difference here is obviously that Fellini is a genius and his creative effort turns out to be splendidly brilliant and entertaining unlike those jr high school papers.    There's so much to say about it.  It's like life--where do you approach it?  Obviously some folks won't like it and that's understandable and fine.  No one likes everything. For those who want a linear plot and everything spelled out for them, forget it. For those who can let go of logic for a little while, ascend into a space where  where dreams and reality, the past and present intermingle, this film can be deeply rich and satisfying.     I saw it when it came out and was dazzled.  In those days, style was big in my book and this film had all of the elements that impressed me and my friends. It's always a risk for me to re-view those films that I fell in love with so long ago...sort of like meeting a first love  again in middle age...will he still charm? This film stood the test.  I was still wildly entertained by the surface beauty but this time I think I understood the basic story a little better.  It's part of the value of this film that there is more to it than style. It has psychological and social validity as well.       I won't recount the story as so many others here have done that.  A psychiatrist could have a field day analyzing Guido's neuroses. I did actually have a hard time believing the final resolution--it seemed to come a little too easily after the long \\"display\\" of the problem.  But what comes across, finally, is the joy of it all.  Fellini may escape into a dream world to avoid his adult commitments but he does come back again...just like Guido escaped from his car up into the stratoshere, but was pulled down by the cord tied to his ankle.  We are asked to believe that these descents or ascents into his dreamworld have helped him to resolve his conflicts.      There is a very touching interview included on the second disk with Sandra Milo, who plays Guido's mistress in the film.  She was Fellini's mistress for 17 years and her comments are not to be missed.  I don't know if Fellini's actual conflicts were resolved as Guido's seem to be, in the film.  But the joy and beauty of the film along with the honesty of the self-revelation give this great magic.          Some of my favorite scenese are those remembrances from Guido's childhood-- like playing in the wine vat and then  being adoringly wiped off by the loving mama.  And the unforgettable scene on the beach of the schoolboys jumping up and down for joy as the town prostitute does the rhumba.  The sheer exuberance and joy of these scenes make the film worth watching.  And the music...!! I give it 8 1/2 stars!
B00008OWZC|2.0|This is a very mixed up set in terms of quality of version.  Some of these it's like, \\"Yeah, this is alright.\\"  Some are like, \\"Eh, whatever.\\"  And some are like, \\"No, that was bad.\\"  Like the acoustic songs, Robert Plant sounds kinda like he's bored!  Now maybe its just me, but I don't like it when they drag out Whole Lotta Love.  It's one of those songs where it's just fine at the length that it is. The only REALLY good song here is Immigrant Song.  If you want to get it, go ahead, but  don't really recomend it.
0743297334|5.0|Written in sparse, simple language, you might be tempted to dismiss the work as banal. But Hemingway, like his friend Picasso, knows the value of pruning so that less is more.<br />The story is set in Paris between the two great wars. There we find a group of attractive, young, well-educated ex-patriots. Our narrator, Jake, is in love with the beautiful Brett. But Jake's war wound makes him unable to satisfy Brett sexually. Their unhappy predicament spawns an unusual love affair. Jake, in effect, becomes Brett's pimp. Just as fish can be lured more successfully with artificial flies than real worms, the lovers use Brett's exotic looks to lure men for \\"artificial\\" love affairs. While never overtly stated, Jake and Brett play their game under strict rules. Brett never falls for any of her \\"lovers.\\" Jake never denies her choices. Jake is always there for her when she needs him. Like Picasso, Hemingway is a master of the double entender. At the Bullfights, we learn that steers are used to calm the wild bulls; it's a steer that leads the bulls to slaughter; bulls get slaughtered, but the steers get to live another day; a great bullfight is one where, at the climax, the bull and matador are one. At the bullfight, like two Greek gods, Brett and a handsome young matador are inevitably attracted to each other. Jake arranges a meeting and then leaves them. After a brief tryst, the young Adonis leaves Brett because Brett won't marry him. Penniless and alone, Brett calls Jake to her rescue. It's not your typical love story, but it makes a swell book.

B0013FBS20|5.0|I didn't see this movie in the theaters (Even though I wanted too) but couldn't resist when it hit blu.  I found the story to move well for Will Smith being about the only person in the film.  This is one of his best performances in my opinon, he has really grown as an actor in the last few years.<br />The Blu Ray transfer is amazing 1080p looks great.  The picture is increadably clean.  I would recomend this to any Sci-Fi fan out there, it deffinatly wasn't the movie I thought it was going to be.
B00005OWEG|2.0|This movie ought to go down in history as a perfect example of a \\"director's cut\\" that should have stayed on the cutting room floor.  The original film is a masterpiece.  This is a mess.  I would recommend this movie ONLY to film students-- in order to learn how you can take the same footage and turn it into a masterpiece, or a mediocrity    The basic problem with \\"Redux\\" is that it just moves too far into \\"surrealism.\\" The original film was surreal, but, hey, to any G.I. in Vietnam, everyday reality was \\"surreal.\\"  But this version of the same film adds a bunch of very, very surreal stuff that completely destroys any suspension of disbelief.    It's like Coppola lost a bet and had to \\"ruin his movie\\" to pay up. What a mess!  Reading some of the reviews here reminded me just how bad this is.  The whole thing about the missing surf board?  Goofy.  The Playboy models as prostitutes?  Silly and salacious.  It takes the best part of the whole \\"Playboy\\" idea and destroys it-- the fact that there is no actual sex but plenty of commercial \\"Sex.\\"  Well folks, now there is actual sex-- not healthy, maybe, but there it is in full color.  Dumb.    Then there is a visit with some French \\"settlers\\" who provide us with some completely inappropriate whining about losing some prime real estate in Southeast Asia.  Cry me a river!    I could go on and on about the flaws-- what a waste of fine film.  The original \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is a five-star landmark in the history of film.  This ought to be made into a permanent memorial of what NOT to do.

B000002VCU|5.0|I think there is one reason why this album is so popular. I know people who find 'I robot' inaccessible, since some of the songs are not so 'pop' orientated, indeed a couple of instrumentals are very hard to like. I also know many more who consider latter albums, like 'vulture cultrue' to be too pop and soft rock.   This album is the transition of both styles, it continues in the prog rock vein, keeping the original fans happy, but is all welcoming to a new audience in its melodic accessibility.  I find side 2 to be a near perfect musical suite, far far better than the often raged about 'abbey road'. This really is a beautifully crafted suite of ideas, starting with the lush and beautiful title track, where Chris Rainbow shows why he is one of the best vocalists of our time. The track continues with Chris on lead for the more rocking and also strong 'snakes eyes', which shows diversity, while still being appealing. The medieval instrumental is nothing short of brilliant, it is so atmospheric. 'Nothing left to lose' is Eric Woolfson at his best. This is an atypical Eric lead song. It is so melodic and gorgeous. Snake eyes is reprised with a nice rock solo, then the record closes out with a reprise of the first track of side 2. It is a musical masterpiece.  The first side of the record couldn't possibly be as good, but it does contain excellent tracks, most noteably Eric's other and simply sublime lead vocal, 'time'. He sings like an angel on that one.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I just can't get enough of the bad-@$$ Winchesters, the hot rod, the music, and of course, the plot thickens and boils over.

B0001XAS1W|5.0|This is the album that put Al Stewart on the charts.  In a way it's an odd result, but the title song took the radio world by storm and Al reaped the benefit.    As I listen to this album, and I must have heard it several hundred times now, I try putting myself into the place of those who hadn't heard of Al before those listeners heard the title song on the radio.  Many must have thought the album was worth a look (or an ear) and then they discovered something far from mainstream music in the other songs.  Historical references, philosophies, and poetic license existed where love songs and sapiness did not.  What a novel concept.  Whatever the result, Al soared in popularity and America had something other than traditional pop/rock music to listen to.    Al's songwriting is crisp and his melodies flow well.  His backing band never misses a beat.  But the main focus is the lyrics.  With the advent of ipods and other personal stereos, the listener has the perfect opportunity to take full advantage of Al's songwriting skills.  This album is a can't miss.  After hearing the title song, Flying Sorcery, Broadway Hotel, and others, the listener will realize there is so much more than stupid love songs.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|This first season of Supernatural is by far the most important of all, it sets the stage for the intense storyline between the characters, and incorporates 'scary stories' and 'urban legends' to create a cinematic experience.

The picutre was outstanding, vibrant colors, sharpness, detail, it all was there in spades.  This is now the blu-ray I compare others to.<br />I highly recommend this, not only for the fantastic movie it is, but also for the blu-ray experience.

0307275639|3.0|Mitch Albom documents the final days of his favorite college professor, Morrie Schwartz.  In Tuesdays With Morrie, Albom discusses the acceptance of dying and appreciating loved ones.  Morrie poses as both the model of acceptance and a coach to Mitch on life's greatest challenges.   Albom is a former student of Morrie Schwartz.  He drifted away from the professor after college.  Albom became a journalist.  He wrote for various newspapers across the country and got caught up in a materialistic world.  Then, Albom saw a Nightline episode where Morrie was being interviewed and decided to reacquaint himself with his old professor.   Morrie Schwartz has ALS, and there is no question that Mitch knows he is going to die.  Therefore, the inquisitive Albom asks about dying and other tough questions.  All of the points are insightful and important.  They connect to the main idea clearly.  Morrie often discusses creating a personal sub-culture.  He believes that the modern world's culture is materialistic, and those who follow it have their priorities mixed up.  In a sub-culture, a person surrounds themselves with loving relationships and creates their own personal values and beliefs.  \\"Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.\\"  Morrie was making the point that when he found out he has ALS and was going to die, he began to focus on the \\"essentials\\" in life.  Instead of worrying about his \\"purchasing power\\", Morrie spent time with friends and family, and therefore began to learn how to truly live.   Tuesdays With Morrie gives insights into some of life's deepest questions and challenges.  There are chapters on the Nightline interviews and stories between the friends demonstrating Morrie's humorous demeanor and lightening the book's mood.  The book has numerous examples and stories to explain Morrie's points, with only a few being redundant.  The book offers a collaboration of Ablom and Morrie's insights and has an endearing way of presenting them with utter honesty.
0060090383|4.0|I love how Marian Keyes can take serious subjects and also inject humor into the situations.  This book is no exception.  This was a really fascinating look into the life of a middle class, sexy, single woman who doesn't believe she's an addict, but a harmless recreational drug user.  Her lifestyle will be familiar to other readers, I think, who also would believe they are only a recreational user.  It is riveting to watch her go through all the stages of denial, anger, shame and ultimately acceptance and forgiveness that leads her to finally live her life fully and with joy.  We hear about people going into rehab all the time, but the average person doesn't know what that entails and that is what I found to be so educational.  Making it especially interesting was seeing the other stories that played out along side Rachel's stay in rehab.  I think everyone will learn some things about themselves and people they know regardless of whether they are addicts.  This was an extremely satisfying and informative book that, as usual with Marian Keyes, was fun also.

1577314808|5.0|This book will change your life.   A previous reviewer said that Eckhart Tolle wraps language around complex ideas in a way that is practical and deeply engaging.  I could not agree more.  This book was a start for me.  His next book, \\"The New Earth\\" is mutually as griping.  It will cause you to be more aware of the dialogues in your head and help you to realize how influenced we are by our ego.  My life has changed since reading both of these books.  In my opinion  Eckhart Tolle is the Einstein of Spirituality of our day.   Thank you Mr. Tolle for a fascinating and life changing book!
0525948023|4.0|The concepts in this book are not new but are timely. We invest ourselves into petty distraction because of our egos. Our egos are frail and we defend them at every opportunity. Mr. Tolle leads you away from these useless encounters and does it in a succinct manner clearly illustrating the wasting of ourselves through our ego driven responses to life and the egos of those around us. Very instructive work and it is an easy read.<br /><br />Leon McBrayer

But as the war in Iraq has dragged on I've become increasingly concerned that McCain will be more of what we've already had too much of over the past 7+ years and, without sounding too cliche, it's time for a change.  Btw, that's coming from a guy who twice voted for George W. Bush...a decision I've grown to deeply regret.<br /><br />So how about Obama's The Audacity of Hope?  Has he won me over through his New York Times bestseller?  Not necessarily.  As I read this book I could see any of the candidates saying much of what's presented here.  I didn't find any one thing that jumped out at me as the key reason why I absolutely must vote for Obama.  The book is well written and I feel it gave me a glimpse of the man, his life, family, etc., but I'm hard-pressed to say it's a vote-getter.<br /><br />Obama is clearly an extremely bright man and I'm in tune with his thoughts on investing in education, technology and a health care system that provides for the needy.  Then again, who wouldn't be?!  If you close your eyes and think about it, doesn't that sound like any one of the other candidates talking...from 2008, 2004 or perhaps even earlier?  To be fair, the book was originally published two years ago and the political landscape has changed a bit in that time.  Anyone interested in studying Obama's stance on the latest and greatest issues would be better served by visiting his website or following his blog.<br /><br />I definitely feel this book was a worthwhile read.  It added some depth to the superficial candidate dialog and bickering that makes the six-o'clock news every night.  It's hard to believe we have seven more months of this ahead of us...<br /><br />P.S. -- At this point, Obama probably has my vote.  But that's as much the result of my lack of interest in the other candidates as it is my heartfelt support for Obama.  While that's not exactly a ringing endorsement, I don't think he'd be any worse than the guy I voted for the last two times.ng endorsement, I don't think he'd be any worse than the guy I voted for the last two times.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|This is the first Blu-ray documentary title I have purchased.  Although it's actually produced in 1080i format rather than 1080p as erroneously stated on the packaging, it is nevertheless a documentary worth buying.  It is apparent the BBC crew had gone to great length and risk to film all the never before seen places on earth.  Had the document been produced in the 1080p format, the sceneries would be even more awe-inspiring. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who's interested in learning more about the natural world around us.
0593057023|3.0|Contrary to what many reader's believe Lee Child is British, but moved with his family from Cumbria to the United States to begin a new career as an American thriller writer. What probably fools a lot of people is that is rare for a British author to be able to write American thrillers with any kind of authenticity. He has won a number of awards with his books and he lives just outside New York City with his American wife Jane. The couple have a grown-up daughter, Ruth and when Lee is not writing he shares his time between music, reader and supporting the New York Yankees.     I am a big fan of Lee Child's books but I found this one very difficult to get into. I don't know whether it is the fact that the character of Jack Reacher is starting to wear a little thin or the fact that I didn't think the storyline was as good as the author's other books. Having said that the book was perfectly readable, it just did not come up to my expectations.    Jack Reacher, Lee Child's main character is a footloose and fancy free former army cop, hard as nails when it suits him and not afraid to wander outside the law if it suits him or is going to get him results. Trouble follows him around like a bad smell, jack can never fathom out why, it just happens. Basically it is always Jack Reacher against the world and today is no different. In this new novel it is Jack Reacher against a whole town. He has just entered a sleepy Colorado town and they don't just want him out, they want him dead . . .

Just like the normal sixaxis this one is perfectly balanced to sit in your hand comfortably.

B00000AFHM|5.0|Boy with the Arab Strap isn't a perfect album -- Sinister is more consistent, but it's definitely a lot more varied instrumentally than its predecessor.  Unlike Sinister, there's actually a buildup, and then a letting go, along with some looser-sounding improvisation at the end of \\"Rollercoaster Ride\\".<br /><br />This is the first album which included songs not written by Stuart Murdoch (Chickfactor, Seymour Stein, A Space Boy Dream, Is it Wicked to Care?).  Although they're not of the same quality (no offence to Isobel and company, but Stuart sets the bar pretty high!), they fit very well in with the rest of the album.<br /><br />It's important to view TBTWAS as an album... On their own, the songs aren't as attractive, but the fact that Space Boy Dream and Seymour Stein are right before Dirty Dream #2 makes them all the better for it.<br /><br />B&S are special, somehow.  The songs don't actually refer to anything, but really you know what they're talking about. The arrangements are quiet, yet intricate, and everything pulls together in a way such that they can use a bagpipe and weird electronic sounds, and yet none of it sounds out of place...<br /><br />Some people like B&S, other's don't.  In any case, they're a band that really grow on you. This album, along with Sinister, I swear I appreciate more every time I hear it. I'd advise anyone who is new to Belle & Sebastian to start with Dear Catastrophe Waitress in order to get a feel for their sound, and then move on to some of their older records.
B000YDOOUK|5.0|Thank God!!    Finally classic aussie  pub rock is back....The great aussie bands of the past, like The Angels, Rose Tattoo, Midnight Oil I thought it was all lost....Airbourne has revived the Oz rock scene.    There is nothing special about the music, but that is the point of pub rock, just good old hand bangin, beer drinking music, nothing more and nothing less.    I grew up in the 1980's many a night was spent at The Sands at Narrabeen,  rocking out to bands named above. Fights in the carpark, blood flowing that is what 70's 80's oz rock was all about.    I live in Little Rock Arkansas now but I relive those days at The Sands like it was yesterday.    Airbourne has breathed new life into the music scene especially all the crap stuff played in the USA.
0553381687|5.0|As refreshing and new as I am sure Tolkien was when he was first published, IMHO the genre has become somewhat stale.  For the most part if you have read a series of scifi fantasy books (be it Jordan, Goodkind, Brooks, etc.) you have read all of them.  Sure those authors put some derivation in each of their series, but typically they are full of black and white characters, who are wholly good or wholly evil.  Many start with teenaged or early 20s characters, who were orphans and have a secret background, longing for adventure, etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />Along comes George R.R. Martin, to revitalize the genre with his, thus far, superb series A Song of Ice and Fire, the first volume of which is A Game of Thrones.  Martin has created a world, not comprised of black and white, but rather gray.  The characters are complex, fallible and realistic in their humanity.  A Game of Thrones is centered around a family named Stark and while the Starks in large part play the role of protagonist in this volume, in later volumes members of the Stark family do things that will make you cringe and cast them in a darker light.  At the same time there are characters in A Game of Thrones that are despicable and commit horrible acts for whom in later volumes the reader may come to have some respect, identify with or even find themselves cheering.<br /><br />The books are narrated from multiple points of view, e.g. one chapter may be told from the point of view of Eddard Stark, while the next is told from the point of view of Jaime Lannister.  This technique further emphasizes the gray and realism of the story.  Just as in life, every story has different sides.<br /><br />An Arthurian epic with a touch of the supernatural (undead evil and some mysticism) and a whole lot of gray.  Martin provides a welcome fresh breeze to a stale genre.
1416550518|2.0|First of all, I am probably not the best person to review a book by a woman - especially one of this subject. I tend to not fully engage with the female author or her style. It's a guy thing, not a chauvanistic thing....But here I am. However, I do like period novels and I do like a bit of mystery served up to me.     This book provides both, so I tried it.     It's well conceived and put together. The author has apparently spent some time researching the era and has created a book with characters she obviously cares about.    On the whole I think the story is fine, if not a bit light. It seems forced at times.    If you're looking for a bit of pleeasure reading while you lounge by the pool this summer, you could do a lot worse.

B00003CX8N|5.0|I had never heard of Helene Hanff until about two years ago when I chanced upon this little gem of a movie that has stayed with me ever since. I have watched this movie often since then, and find delight in it every single time. Also, I have read Helene Hanff's book of the same title, and it makes for a wonderful read indeed.<br /><br />84 Charing Cross Road is a love story of sorts - of two people brought together [though they live on separate continents] by their love of books, it is also a love of the old-fashioned way of correspondence, through letters, and a love of the written word. It also heavily alludes to a strong affection felt by the two leads for each other - Helene Hanff as portrayed by the wonderful Anne Bancroft [aka Mrs Robinson of The Graduate], and Frank Doel, the manager of the London bookstore at 84 Charing Cross Road [played by well-known thespian Sir Anthony Hopkins, a much younger Hopkins at that].<br /><br />The story focuses on these two characters who lead different lives on different continents - one in NY and the other in London, yet who share a mutual love for books and the written word. Ms Hanff, a struggling writer finds it difficult to obtain obscure works of English literature in New York ['doesn't anyone read English Literature in New York?] and decides to send out a plea for help to an English bookstore, Marks and Co.. Frank Doel, the manager of the store seems delighted by the request and obliges Ms Hanff with a few volumes as requested, and thus begins a wonderful friendship that lasts almost 20 years.<br /><br />What I loved about this movie was the contrast between the two leads - the New Yorker with an acerbic wit who is always very vocal, and the mild-mannered English gentleman. This is done with such finesse that you don't feel like its a cliche at all - thanks in large part to the wonderful 'chemistry' between the two leads, and their acting prowess.<br /><br />A story of true soulmates, brought together by a mutual love of books. This is a movie that will appeal to all bibliophiles and Anglophiles [and Ms Hanff is certainly both] as well as those who have a penchant for literary movies. Though the quality of the DVD leaves much to be desired [the picture quality, lack of features], the story itself is worth viewing and I can't recommend it highly enough!f books.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Cloverfield was the first media sensation of 2008 and an excellent case study in canny marketing. A teaser trailer appeared in theaters months ahead and featured a few, brief, tantalizing scenes of chaos in Manhattan with no mention of a title or who was in it. The only thing that was certain was that J.J. Abrams was somehow involved. Fans speculated about possible similarities to his TV show [[ASIN:B00005JNOG Lost - The Complete First Season]] or the possibility that he had masterminded a new kind of monster movie. This teaser trailer sparked intense interest on the Internet which the studio brilliantly exploited with snippets of information staggered over succeeding weeks. The marketing paid off and the buzz resulted in a strong opening weekend and decent critical reaction.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Matt Reeves. He starts off talking about the genesis of the project and how he got the gig. Reeves says that he resisted the urge to have a lot of obvious edits in favour of long takes or invisible edits in order to mimic a film actually shot by an average person who was there. To that end, he points out that the style of the film was meant to suggest that anyone could have shot it. This is an engaging and informative track with very few lulls.<br /><br />\\"Document 01.18.08: The Making of Cloverfield\\" takes a look at how the film came together amid a shroud of secrecy. The use of hand-held cameras is examined and how it gave the film an authenticity. The on-the-set footage shows how it was filmed, mostly on a soundstage which is amazing because it doesn't look it in the film. We see several scenes being shot and it is fascinating to see how they pulled it off.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield Visual Effects\\" examines how they virtually destroyed Manhattan with CGI effects. The fore and middle ground of scenes were real with practical sets while the background was a mix of CGI and good ol' Matte paintings. This featurette takes us through the major SFX set pieces and shows us how they did them.<br /><br />\\"I saw it! It's alive! It's huge!\\" J.J. Abrams was inspired by Godzilla and its iconic status in Japan and he wanted to do that for America. This featurette takes a look at how the creature was designed and why it looks the way it does.<br /><br />\\"Clover Fun\\" are outtakes and bloopers as the cast blow their lines and goof around.<br /><br />Also included are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Reeves. There is more footage from Rob's farewell party and more of him and his friends in the subway tunnels including more from the aftermath of the attack there.<br /><br />There are two alternate endings with optional commentary by Reeves.

And Keith still is just KEEF!!!! again the old tale of some sort of ginger vision appearing at a concert insisting he could play better than the fill in drummer is trotted out and the nonsense about The Who being banned permanently from Holiday Inns is back again.    2nd disc is excellent should have been more like this.    you should get this however if you don't have Kids, Live at leeds,  the Isle of wight DVD and Dark Side of the Moon (book) get those first. then this. ok?.

It is easy to say that almost all Asia fans (of the original band) will enjoy this album. The surprising part is that this may be their best album. This talented group has created something very new while still being the Asia we knew and loved. It is great to have them back and a collection of songs that capture the 20+ years since their last collective album.    I recommend you try to get to see the band live - they put on a great show with lots of energy.

B00005MP58|5.0|This 2-disc film series is extremely well done, casting seems perfect, sets and scenes delightful, much dialogue comes directly from the book, \\"everything charming\\" and as true as can be to the period in which the book is set.  Several scenes, not in the book, provide very interesting \\"background\\" for the condition of Mr. Darcy during which time he is absent from Bennett scenes of action.    Anyone who sees this movie would be advised to get the publication, \\"The Making of Pride and Prejudice\\", which tells how the film was made, scenes and settings found (with map of southwest England), costumes designed, and includes comments from actors.  There are hilarious characterizations here (Lady Catherine de Bourgh; Mr. Collins; Mrs. Bennett), a romantic story (or two), all excellently done.  Mr. Hurst has practically no spoken lines, but his expressive physical presence in several scenes provides sight enough to make his character \\"speak\\", especially the scene in which only his satin-breeched form lies sleeping in the center.

After the first song, the rest didn't sound very distinctive. Like others, Sara's music reminded me of Fiona Apple, which made me like this album less, because Fiona is far superior.

B000ZN802W|5.0|I was familiar with Krakauer from his previous book, Into Thin Air, about the ill-fated climb on Mt. Everest, so I was interested to see how a film based on this book would turn out. I haven't read the book, but I did enjoy the movie, and found it memorable in many ways, although some liberties were taken for artistic reasons.<br /><br />All the main players turned in superb performances, and Hal Holbrook (who I almost didn't recognize as I hadn't seen him on-screen in probably 25 years), was a joy to watch; he turns in possibly his greatest performance in a long, distinguished career as the aging preacher. He must be about 80 and looks pretty darn good for his age. He turns in a thoughtful but forceful performance as a man, who, although nearing the and of this life, has found the peace that Chris unsuccessfully seeks.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch is outstanding in the lead role as Chris, in which he's portrayed almost as a mythic adventurer of old setting out to test himself against the elements. He's charismatic and collects many friends and admirers along the way. Cris is convinced that he must purge the \\"evil within,\\" why this is, isn't really explained, except that Chris had fallen under the influence of authors such as Thoreau, and others who had exhorted the importance of living apart from society in order to live the solitary life and reflect.<br /><br />The cinematography is also one of the film's great strengths. You'll enjoy the many stunning vistas of Alaska, which is still largely an unspoiled and unexploited land. Let's hope it stays that way.<br /><br />Overall the film is a dramatic and beautiful portrayal of a young man's quest for meaning, allthough it ultimately ended in tragedy, Despite some departures from the facts (Chris was not the charismatic character that was portrayed in the movie so much as a loner), it's still a fine film and one worth seeing for the other aesthetic qualities it brings to the screen.<br /><br />While we're on the subject, I wanted to make a few comments on another topic. I've read several Alaskan's comments who were very critical of Chris and what he tried to do, saying how foolish it was and how it showed little respect for the wilderness and the sort of skills and learning it takes to survive under those conditions, which can only be gleaned from many years of experience, and preferably under the tutelage of an experienced backwoodsman.<br /><br />That is no doubt true, and it's certainly true that Chris made some serious mistakes that an experienced backwoodsman wouldn't have made. For example, he failed to bring a map of the region that would have showed an area about 25 miles upstream where it spread out into some wide shallows, where the river could have safely been forded. There was also a hand tram only about a mile away from his camp that would have enabled him to escape. And he brought inadequate food and wasn't experienced enough in plant identification to live off the land, which led not only to starvation but poisioning when he misidentified a toxic plant that looked like a safe plant and that often grew right next to it.<br /><br />However, I would point out that those same people still buy their outdoor gear at REI, or some such, and have many modern conveniences that frontiersman or tribesman of old didn't have, which dramatically reduce the amount of labor and skill required and enhance their chances of survival. Not to mention the skillset of a late period Paleolithic hunter, who had to make his own spear tips and spears, bow and arrows, his own clothes, and virtually everything else in his toolkit himself. Even a modern woodsman's skills would pale by comparison to that.<br /><br />Recently I read a great biography of Daniel Boone and of his exploits in the new territories to the west. Of course, even he wasn't a Paleolithic hunter, but he was certainly one hell of a woodsman for his day. Equally impressive was the description of his wife. While Boone was off for several weeks wandering in a new area of the wilderness, leaving his young wife at home, she first proceeded to cut down the trees on their new plot of land. Then she built a small log cabin from the felled trees. Finally, she had their first field plowed and the crop sowed on the now cleared land by the time Boone got home. :-)<br /><br />Today, few people, even the vaunted backwoodsmen who criticized Chris, are the equivalent of a Daniel Boone, let alone a true Paleolithic hunter.

1400032717|4.0|Mark Haddon is a novelist known best for his book, The Curious Incident of the Dog at Night Time, in which he won the WhitBread Book of the Year Award.  His book is about a boy named Christopher who has Asperger's Syndrome, a mental disorder, in which people have difficulties in social interactions.  He fears strangers and new places, and screams when people touch him.  Yet, he has an amazing memory and is mathematically gifted.  His perspectives give the reader a different way of viewing events taking place.   He sees things logically and takes words literally.  As a young man, Mark Haddon worked with autistic people and was motivated to write about one.  He is also an atheist, and he uses the character to get some of his views/points about God across to the readers.   In his novel, one night Christopher discovers his neighbor's dog along with the garden fork used to kill him.  He is seen holding Wellington, the dog, in his arms and is arrested.  He is determined to find out the dog's true murderer and learns more than he intended.  The secrets he discovers are too much for him to handle, and he runs away to live with a family member.  While on his journey, he must face situations in which he can no longer close himself off from the world around him.  While his investigation and journey is taking place, he is influenced by one of his school teachers to write about the mystery and his adventure.  Hence, the story is written from Christopher's point of view and tends to be simple in its style.  Also, the reader figures out some clues before he does.  As for myself, I truly enjoyed reading this novel and recommend for all to read it, for it was entertaining, informative and some times funny.

Wonderful ending for fans. I still miss Richard Dean Anderson. Can't he and Samantha get married now that the world is safe and he's retired?

B0013FBS20|5.0|Will Smith does it again. I Am Legend [Blu-ray] is a must have. The PQ is crystal clear and the audio is just as great. Special effects and design is pretty cool in depicting a deserted New York City. I love the original theatrical version, and the alternate ending adds an interesting twist. So whether you're a Will Smith fan, wanting a Blu-ray title to show off your new HDTV, or your simply a fan of the movie you can't go wrong picking this one up.
B0010X745K|1.0|The mist, is without a doubt Stephen King's worst punishment to his fans since Rose Red.<br /><br />Now, I know that the people in horror movies are supposed to be on the stupid side or otherwise no one would die and it wouldn't be much of a horror movie. But this, my friends... Is ridiculous! I don't know if breathing in the mist somehow effects your brain, if so, they certainly didn't mention it in the movie, but you'll watch the character's in this movie continuously make the dumbest mistakes possible! So dumb in fact, that it ruins the entire movie!<br /><br />The ridiculousness starts at the beginning of the movie, after a tree crashes through the main character's window during a storm, he starts to drive to the store with his son and next door neighbor. As he's driving down the road, he sees several trucks full of soldiers headed in the direction of his house, but rather than thinking this odd and turning back, he just keeps right on going.<br /><br />Fast forward to when he's already inside the store after everyone sees just how dangerous the mist is and how after anyone goes into it, you hear lots of screaming and ripping noises, and the person who went in doesn't seem to come back. Hmmmm... Could this suggest that there's something bad in the the mist and that the reason why there's so much screaming when somebody goes in and doesn't come back is because whatever was inside killed them??? Aparently not, because when the generator that powers the store stops working and the main character tells them not to go outside to try and fix it because a moment ago he saw something banging on the garage door, they all accuse him of imagining it. Then one of the teenage workers offers to go outside and fix it, and guess what? He gets killed by some sort of huge tentacled monster just seconds after opening the door. *GASPS* Didn't see that one coming...<br /><br />Fast forward again to later in the movie, it's night now and after what happened to the teenage boy everyone has piled bags of dog food, charcole, fertilizer, etc against all the doors and windows. (Yeah, that oughta keep 'em out...) They've also come up with the grand idea of soaking the heads of mops in buckets of kerosene to use as torches! (Bravo!) As well as rigging up an emergency lighting system of heat lamps powered by batteries.<br />Now here's where the main character becomes just as dumb as everyone else and stops being the voice of reason in the film... One of the characters is sitting by a window with a lanturn, and suddenly a large insect-like monster with a huge stinger lands on the window. More people show up with there lanturns to investigate, and more bugs fly onto the window. Anyone else here know what attracts insects? Well, after standing there for what might as well have been an hour, our sharp-as-a-tack hero realizes that the bugs are being attracted by the light. (Once again, if I realized the minute that the first bug flew onto the window that the lanturn attracted it, then how dumb are the people in this town that it took them that long to figure it out?!) By the time our brilliant hero has uncovered the mystery of what has attracted the bugs, the guys in the back of the store figured it was the best idea to turn on the emergency lights and point them at the front window! A big gargoyle-like thing crashes through the window, the idiots light their torches and one of them procedes to trip over the buckets of kerosene that they left lying in the middle of the floor for easy access, thus burning himself alive & catching the store afire!<br /><br />Now, I should've stopped watching here, but I drove on...<br />Later that night, they put out the fire, and saved the guy who lit himself and the store on fire. A woman who can no longer take the fear, commits suicide that night by swollowing a handful of pills, and the idiots carry her body to the window. (I was surprised at that point to see that they didnt break open the window, put her body on a grillas some form of funerary pyre, and have a fan blow her roasting fumes out the open window.)<br />After that, the idiots decide to go next door to the pharmacy to treat the guy who cooked himself. More people die and the dumb guy is dead by the time they make it back.<br />Next, the crazy overly-Christian lady starts a cult inside the store and pretty much everyone joins, then they sacrafice a young army cadet for the sins that brought this horror upon them.<br />Our hero, his son, the babysitter, the lovable old lady, and the nice old man escape, get into a car and attempt to drive beyond the reach of the mist.<br />After awhile, the car runs out of gas and they decide to commit suicide by shooting themselfs with their gun. (Now, with all the wrecked cars lying around them, you'd figure that they would just siphon some gas, but aparently killing themselves was a better idea...) 4 bullets, 5 people... Our hero shoots his son, the babysitter, and the 2 old people. He then gets out of the car and screams his head off at the horror of what he has just done.<br />Seconds later, a tank and soldiers show up with several trucks filled with survivors, and the soldiers procede to use flame throwers to burn down these large cacoons that were hanging from the trees. After the cacoons are all burned, the mist dissipates... Then, the movie ends...<br />And to think, if the main character had've gotten out of the car to siphon gas, one of the other survivors could've covered him with the hand gun, then they could've gotten back into the car, and before they could even turn the key they would've seen the army.<br /><br />So, in the end, it was a dumb movie, with dumb characters, that had a dumb ending because they were dumb...<br />Now normally, I would've thought that our beloved scare master Stephen King had purposely made everyone so dumb as some kind of moral to the story, but alas... It wasn't presented in that way. It was meant to appear as a tragically ironic, \\"Oh, if they only had've waited another second...\\" ending.<br /><br />Also, as a Stephen King fan, I wasn't fond of the teaser within the movie...<br />At the begining, the main character is drawing a painting of Roland from Stephen King's \\"The Dark Tower\\" series with a rose at his side and the fabled tower in the background. Then later, you find out that the main character draws movie posters... Now, if that was only a fan teaser and Stephen King never makes The Dark Tower into a movie, then that's just cruel...

B000060OFT|2.0|I suppose credit has to be given for the attempt.  To recreate anything Shakespeare is a risky proposition, but to do so with a modern day twist is a concept that simply fails.  Don't get me wrong; the actors make a valiant effort.  In fact, the actors' shared abilities are the saving grace for this film.  Even the love-at-first-sight connetion between Romeo (Dicaprio) and Juliet (Daines) is obvious.<br /><br />Aside from the actors, however, this movie simply irritated me.  I appreciate the beauty and style of previous pieces too much to truly like this this version.  The previous movie adaptations stuck to the medieval nature, the sword-fighting days of old, and the classic tale of star-crossed lovers.  This travesty, on the other hand, made no such effort.<br /><br />Guns, fireworks, pool-halls, neon signs, a red-headed guy with a box haircut, and a cross-dressing Mercutio?  It's just too forced and out of place; the anachronistic nature is just an impossibly big pill to swallow.  The combination of style and time-period for this historic piece feels like the Geico cavemen commercials; except, those commericals are intended to be funny.<br /><br />Seeing modern day actors in contemporary settings and clothing while holding true to the original prose of Romeo and Juliet may have a cinematographic appeal to it, and I'm sure it introduced the arts to a generation with just enough attention span for a music video saturated with strobe-lights and special effects, but to me this movie is the proverbial elevator in an outhouse.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Machine Head made an amazing entry into the world with their first album a long time ago.  Subsequent albums lost something along the way, perhaps with various changes in line-up, changing music scene, whatever.  I thought the glory years of Machine Head were in the distant past.  Damn, I was wrong.  This album takes you back to \\"Burn My Eyes\\" and maybe even surpasses it.  This album is heavy!  It should have won a Grammy.  What is apparent from the first song (\\"Clenching the Fists of Dissent\\") is that this album is a roller coaster.  A single song can be heavy, slow, driving, quiet.  All of it is awesome headbanging fare!  Songs are long - two of them are 10 minutes long, and the shortest is just under 5 minutes.  But if you want to be pummeled, it should be done right and the length of these songs helps dish out the pain in the proper way.<br /><br />There is some truly awesome lead guitar work on this album, with numerous harmonized lead guitar parts, back-and-forth/dueling leads that are reminiscent of Judas F'in Priest, and generally no concern about throwing down the guitar gauntlet and not being afraid to work all six strings until they break.  \\"Aesthetics of Hate\\" has some awesome guitar work (maybe no coincidence since this song is defending the memory of Dimebag, and that will guarantee your best licks are going to come through).<br /><br />There's a lot of politically oriented stuff here, Machine Head is mad as hell about the world we live in.  It doesn't matter if you agree with their political views or not, that energy made one of the best metal albums i've heard in years.  If every band has one chance to make their \\"Master of Puppets\\" this might be Machine Head's.  IF YOU ARE METAL, YOU MUST GET THIS ALBUM.  YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.

As far as the movie I can't say enough good things about it.  I'm a huge fan of \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and that's why I bought this movie.  I like it even better which is saying something.  The acting is great, fight scenes are great, storyline is great.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD as I like to workout in the mornings before work, so I needed something fast and effective.  I'm convinced I found it!  You don't have to buy expensive equipment either, what a bonus.  Just light weights and a mat (if you prefer) - and you are off!  I could barely make it through level 1 and I could feel the burn after about 3 minutes (yes, shortly after the warm up).  I love that you quickly move from one workout to the next so you don't do one move for too long.  And even when the 3-2-1 rotation starts over it's all new moves so you don't get bored or frustrated.  While working out my husband said, that doesn't seem so hard - but it looks like it's kicking your butt.  And it was!  The moves are basic, but every second is working multiple muscles and it BURNS!  And the best result - for the first time in weeks I feel full of energy and ready to face my day - I don't feel like crawling back in to bed for 10 more minutes of sleep.  If you have ever considered getting a personal trainer like I have, I think this is a great substitue for a lot less $$!  She explains how to do these basic moves so you aren't hurting yourself, and once you know the moves well enough you can turn her off and just listen to music - WHAT A GREAT IDEA!   After the 30 day challenge this will definitely stay in my rotation at least a couple days a week for good muscle toning and burn!  She is motivating and not as forceful as she seems on TV, which was one of my concerns.  I'm am very impressed and looking forward to great results!
044024238X|3.0|I guess even the great Sophie Kinsella can write a clunker once.  Having dearly loved the Shopaholic books plus her other two free-standing ones, I was anxious to read this.  Happily, it did have her trademark humor and slightly unrealistic situations up to a point.  I am more than willing to suspend reality when reading chick lit and relish the pure joy of the situation, the humor, and the romance.  But in the last fifty pages of this one, the writer lost me both emotionally and intellectually.  Samantha Sweeting ceased to be the high-powered London lawyer who through goofy circumstances became a domestic in the English countryside.  She became an utter fool. I always pass on Sophie Kinsella's books to my twenty-something daughter who loves her work as much as I do, but I will put a warning label on this one...happiness is not available to only the poor.  Career women with fast-track and highly responsible jobs can also find happiness and romance.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that REMEMBER ME, her next free-standing book, is excellent and on a par with the incomparable Shopaholic series.  I'll continue to always read her books, but this is not one I could recommend.

0307237702|3.0|Reading this will give you a sense of the man Obama. He demonstrates a high level of reasoning while considering various sides of complex problems. But, you will also find a simmering distrust just below the surface. Reading in the book that the title is taken from the title of one of Obabma's favorite sermons of Rev. Wright perhaps reveals a different meaning of the title. Who believes who has the audacity to hope? Considering that Rev. Wright authored that phrase it just does not seem as hopeful. But all in all, a good read, especially after reading Newt's book for comparison.
1400032717|3.0|This book was written by Mark Haddon.  Haddon was born in 1962 in Northampton, England and attended Oxford where he studied English.  Haddon wrote this book about an autistic child.  His knowledge of autism comes from working with autistic people as a young man.  Haddon won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award and the Commonwealth Writer's Prize Overall Best First Book for his work on The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.    The novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is an excellent portrayal of a child with autism.  In this novel autistic Christopher Boone in on a quest to discover who killed his neighbor's dog, Wellington.  His autism is apparent as he finds out who the killer is, and goes through his daily life.   The entire novel brilliantly captures how an autistic person lives his life through routine and how he is very intelligent as well.  Christopher says, \\"In the bus on the way to school the next day we passed 4 red cars in a row, which meant it was a Good Day, so I decided not to be sad about Wellington\\" (24).  He also says, \\"My name is Christopher John Francis Boone.  I know all the countries in the world and their capital cities and every prime number up to 7,057\\" (2).  These two quotes show how people with autism need consistency and routine as well, and they also show Christopher's intelligence.  Christopher hates the color yellow but loves the color red, which is why he has Good Days and Black Days.  When there are many red things in a row, he deems it a Good Day, and when there are many yellow things in a row he deems it a Black Day.  During Black Days Christopher talks to no one and eats nothing.  He sits in a corner all day and mopes.  He also has a photographic memory; he can memorize perfectly the scenery of any place he visits.   Despite the fine portrayal of an autistic person, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is somewhat boring at parts.  For example, I lost interest when Christopher is trying tofind the train station and when he is trying to get to his train.  The reader will most likely skim through these portions and not catch some of Haddon's main points.  If he attempted to liven up the story a bit he would engage the reader, get the reader more interested and in doing so would be able to convey his ideas more effectively.   Besides this, Haddon still excellently shows how an autistic person lives his life.  With great detail, he describes as Christopher's senses go into overdrive.  When this happens Christopher starts to groan somewhat like stimming.  He also shows how other people, such as Christopher's parents and aide, interact with him.   This novel is much like the movie Rain Man displaying how autistic people have poor communication skills.  In Rain Man, Raymond repeats himself and other people over and over again.  He also can't comprehend their questions very well.  In The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time Christopher doesn't understand complex human emotions.  He only understands simple emotions like happy and sad.  Christopher also has to ask people what they mean when they say something or make facial expressions.   This wonderful portrayal of autism provides a lot of good information.  It demonstrates how an autistic person lives and how other people interact with them.  Haddon had an excellent understanding of autism when writing this novel.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|A visually stunning and captivating finale to the Ori storyline.  Its packed full of jam, as Vala would say.  The special effects are brilliant and exceedingly detailed.  The soundtrack is equally remarkable.  It maintains a pretty fast pace throughout- this is not a single episode drawn out into a movie but more like a feature length uber-episode.  The producers/writers managed to preserve the classic Stargate feel while still making the show refreshing and entertaining.  There is an optional introduction for those who have not seen the 9th and 10th seasons, so if you're a little behind with the series you can still follow the movie (though I highly recommend watching the seasons if you haven't).  All in all, I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I bought this DVD as soon as it came out, having heard raving reviews of the movie. To say I was bitterly disappointed is a supreme understatement!! There was absolutely NOTHING i liked about it.<br /><br />It was altered dramatically from the beautiful funny and heartwarming book Jane A wrote, into a commercial, inaccurate, and brash Hollywood version. I felt like every bit of character Jane A infused ito the book had been bleached out. Perhaps the most disappointing thing was the casting of Keira K as Elizabeth. There was very little of Elizabeth in her performance in fact I really disliked her character (and I love Elizabeth!!). I suppose after watching the A&E verion the standard is very high and this scraped the bottom of the barrel!!!

0786867973|5.0|There's no way I could resist buying this cookbook when I saw that it had a giant cupcake on the front cover!  I am pleased to say that it delivers on all accounts.  I bought the paperback version and am quite happy with the construction.  The binding is thick but does not pose difficulty in keeping the book open (and I've had no problem with the binding breaking or cracking).<br /><br />The recipes are divided into 9 chapters including cakes, cookies/scones/muffins, pies, desserts, chocolate, children, xmas, bread & yeast and the domestic goddess's pantry.<br /><br />The font Nigella chose is clear and easy on the eyes and the ingredient list for each recipe is in bold so I have no problem finding the ingredient list on the page when going back and forth from the list to what I am doing.<br /><br />The pictures are absolutely beautiful.  They are glossy, colorful and very well presented and each chapter is divided with sparkling gold pages.<br /><br />The recipes themselves are nicely chosen and are evocative of both the English country-side and the glamor of London (and beyond).  Examples include:<br /><br />Chocolate cherry cupcakes<br />Pain-au-chocolate pudding<br />London cheesecake<br />Gateau Breton<br />Fairy Cakes<br />Carrot Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting<br />Peach Cream Pie<br />Espresso Cupcakes<br />Granny Boyd's Cookies<br />Snickers & Peanut Butter Muffins<br />Jam-Doughnut Muffins<br />Fresh Gingerbread with Lemon Icing<br /><br />Finally, the best aspect of the cookbook is the fact that Nigella includes a little paragraph with each recipe.  If you've ever seen her cooking show, you will know that she is quite sensual, a quality that is also very evident in the recipes and the accompanying, mouth-watering descriptions she provides.<br /><br />For anyone who loves to bake, I'd recommend that you add this to your library of cookbooks!

Yes, you do get a fast-moving insider account of Jobs's impressive accomplishments, and learn fascinating facts about the development of Apple's signature products, including the ipod.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I realized with a movie like this that you either hate it or love it, especially when I spoke to many of my friends who saw it. Most of them loved it and the other few couldn't stand the movie. I personally absolutely loved this film!! It's unique, unlike the comparison to the Blair Witch Project which to me doesn't even compare, it is incredible from a filmmaker's point of view. I saw it twice and I still jumped at every creepy part, even as a 21 year old guy. Within the movie lies a back story we don't get to see, but it makes you think long after the movie is over. The fear these people go through, what would you do in this situation? The realism of the camera allows you to almost play a character in the movie, as you live every scare, every dark alley, explosion, attack, it's all so amazing. I can't wait for this release, I haven't been this excited for a long time for a dvd release. Please check it out, and you can decide, If you love or hate the adventure that is CLOVERFIELD...
0446402389|5.0|This non-stop train-ride of a crime thriller will seize your attention from the first twenty emotionally wrenching pages and keep you hanging on for dear life for the remaining four hundred pages.  Set in Moscow in 1953, when Communism controlled every aspect of daily life, and government officials believed that \\"there is no crime,\\" the novel recreates the turmoil in the life of a State Security Force official who begins, reluctantly, to question the \\"facts\\" before him.  Leo Stepanovich Demidov, working for MGB (Internal Security), is drawn into an investigation of the death of a four-year-old, supposedly struck and killed by a train.  The child's family believes he was murdered, but Leo conveys a not-so-subtle warning to them not to question the state's findings regarding the child's death.<br /><br />Because each community certifies its own causes of death, Leo can only regard the death of this child as a single instance of a mysterious death.  When he is relocated to a more remote village and discovers that there has been a similar death there, however, he begins surreptitiously to investigate.  Always, he must hide his reasons for asking for information.  He cannot afford to be labeled as a doubter--he has a wife and parents to protect.  Soon he has created a map showing dozens of similar crimes.<br /><br />As Leo is trying to identify a serial killer, he must also deal with internal politics within the security service, including his own demotion and loss of reputation.  A fellow MGB officer will stop at nothing to bring him down.  At the same time, however, Leo is still a party man, and he plays by the book in his other investigations, including the interrogation, beating, and eventual execution of two men he knows to be innocent victims of the system.  Torture, the use of informants, constant spying on each other, and the manipulation of records, are public policy--\\"Terror protects the Revolution,\\" the party believes.<br /><br />Author Tom Rob Smith's accomplished debut novel is filled with carefully drawn and vivid characters, all of whom convey their complex personalities within the structure of their communist society.  His creation of Moscow life feels realistic, and his inclusion of maxims which could be part of a communist handbook adds to the sense of realism--and horror.  Comparisons with Martin Cruz Smith (one of my favorite mystery writers) are inevitable, and this novel is at least as good as the best of Cruz Smith.  In some ways--notably his ability to recreate the emotional milieu of the communist society--he may be even more successful.

Comparisons with Martin Cruz Smith (one of my favorite mystery writers) are inevitable, and this novel is at least as good as the best of Cruz Smith.  In some ways--notably his ability to recreate the emotional milieu of the communist society--he may be even more successful.

B000WMFZNS|4.0|Finally and at last a quality dvd version of this excellent \\"knight in shining armour\\" epic spectacular starring the late Charlton Heston in one of his very best and most memorable roles. And of course the same can be said for the very beautiful Sophia Loren in one of her very best roles. They both give excellent, believable performances in this tale of heroic idealism that was so very typical of the President John F Kennedy era. Indeed it is said that this was one of President Kennedy's favourite films! And yet despite their utterly convincing performances it is also said that Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren privately intensely disliked if not hated each other even though they respected each other's talents. Great acting indeed!    This was producer Samuel Bronston's biggest box office success (1961) coming within months of the qualified success of his previous production \\"King of Kings\\" with Jeffrey Hunter in 1961 (King of Kings was not as popular as EL CID but still a substantial enough success after a while). EL CID was both a critical and commercial success perfectly encapsulating the idealism of the President Kennedy era in this tale of a chivalrous knight who risks his wife, his position in society and his loyalty to his king by putting his greater loyalty to his country above all else. This was a role perfectly fitting the acting talents of Charlton Heston as he had established a reputation for playing such larger than life characters (eg. Moses, Ben Hur) and he is reported to have very enthusiastically wanted to play the role. Strangely, in his autobiography, he admits that whilst he was very proud of the film he was unhappy with the editing of the finished version stating that the battle scenes weren't edited vigorously enough, the drama tends to drag at times and that Sophia Loren's character does not age like she's supposed to as his character ages throughout the film (maybe part of the actors' reported mutual dislike of each other). He also speculatedthat EL CID could have been a slightly better film if William Wyler of \\"Ben Hur\\" fame had directed El Cid and Anthony Mann (El Cid's director) would have produced a nearly as successful version of \\"Ben Hur\\" if Mann had directed \\"Ben Hur\\". Heston was a veteran of these epic spectacular films so his opinion is very interesting indeed.       However most people regard this film fondly because of its idealistic heroism and its very spectacular settings. I suspect that there is a fond nostalgia for this type of heroic idealism that typifies the President Kennedy era. Producer Bronston wanted absolute accuracy mainly in the locations but there is speculation that most of the scripts for his movies contain historical inaccuracies and EL CID is no exception. He did however strive for geographical & architectural accuracy in most of his productions but this was especially necessary with EL CID as General Franco's government in Spain wanted him to make an epic film in Spain about Spain itself and indeed Spanish characters. He did build large, impressive, architecturally & historically accurate sets in Spain but was also able to use the actual castles of Spain to great effect and shoot on location as these settings were virtual perfect replicas of the original settings where the events took place (eg. the city of Pamplona in Spain  was a virtual carbon copy of the medieval city of Valencia where the final sequences of the film are set). Director Anthony Mann was renowned for his directorial technique of integrating his characters into very spectacular natural landscapes and also handling personal relationships sensitively and he was the ideal director for this film.     In short, a great, spectacular historical epic with believable, human characters that appeals to most people due to its idealistic hero but perhaps not for all tastes as the idealism of the President Kennedy era has long since vanished. I only give it 4 out of five stars because of some of the story's historical inaccuracies and Sophia Loren's hollywood film star youthful appearance throughout the entire story when her character should have aged somewhat when the story moves forward several years later. These however are only minor criticisms of a truly great film.     By the way this film & \\"The Fall of The Roman Empire\\" LIMITED COLLECTOR'S EDITION versions are THE DEFINITE VERSIONS to get as all the extras in these LIMITED EDITION versions (lobby cards & reproductions of the original souvenir programs) are sure to be worth much, much more as movie memorabilia once the LIMITED EDITIONS sell out. As the title implies a LIMITED EDITION is limited in the quantities made and once sold out cannot become available again making these limited editions a rarity. A truly great investment at $27.99  If these films sell in sufficient numbers the ultimate blue ray edition is inevitable which will show the magnificence of the set design & cinematography of these films to their fullest extent.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Here's the deal, this movie and soundtrack is AWESOME!  For those who expect a \\"Hollywood\\" A-lister movie, you wouldn't get this one. It's one of those movies in that every time you watch it, it gets better and better.  My advice for those who don't get it is keep watching!!
B00005V1B1|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - The follow up to Camel's debut album, Mirage prooves to be a much more cohersive and astonishing, comprehensible album than its predecessor. In this case, the progresive rock seen is much more compelling, profesional, and correctly prepared and arrange, with subtle, rhythmical jazz expressions (\\"Freefall\\") and exponential, infectious, elongated riffs (\\"Lady Fantasy\\", which may stand as their magnum opus), the album has become one of their classics and most loved. The problem of their satiric and insipid improvisation is obvious in the customized prog pieces \\"Earthrise\\" and \\"Nimrodel\\", but as far as it goes, music is down to earth, and the classic lineup plays for the first time in a fine manner, but still they were not into any concrete fashion.
B00154GEFU|5.0|A huge fan of Asia from the first time I heard \\"Heat Of The Moment.\\"  Their first release was one of the first CD's I ever purchased.  You gotta remember that home CD players were just coming onto the scene in 1982.  Anyway, before I get too sidetracked...  I am also a big and longtime fan of each member of Asia.  I have pretty much all of each artist's releases from the earliest of their days on the music scene.  I say all of this to say I have relevance in saying this is Asia's best work.  Period.  If you really are a fan of Asia, you will not be let down by Phoenix.  It's a great recording job, too.  I hope they stay together long enough to put out even more music!  Long live Asia!!
B000035Z1Z|5.0|I love this movie !!  I've bought multiple copies, told lots of friends about it, and continue to laugh at Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline everytime I watch it.  Watch Kevin Kline closely, his humor is constant & subtle. Meg Ryan is at her comedic best. Chick Flick, yes, but when you want a funny romantic bit of time to share with someone special it is perfect.
0743289692|5.0|I am one of those people who would insist, in conversation, that Islam is Really a peaceful religion. After reading this book I have definitely changed my opinion.  The book, Infidel, reads more like a novel than a memoir and should be required reading for all young people.  The book recalls Hirsi's personal journey, it also recounts the history and tribal battles of Somalia and other countries in the area.  She takes the reader on her travels through Islam and also the Quran.  Infidel gives the greatest insight into why our battles in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan have not been successful and an understanding of the teachings of Islam. She explains why she believes that many Westerners have problems understanding Islam due to their misguided feelings of \\"political correcness\\". The book is a MUST read for anyone who wants to enlighten themselves on our ongoing terrorist fight and an undestanding of the terrible treatment of women in many parts of the world.
B00006F83Y|4.0|one of the best things about queens of the stone age is that it's really difficult for me to liken them to any other band.  they do what they do really well and it's always refreshing and different.  i actually prefer era vulgaris to songs for the deaf, despite the fact that dave grohl's drumming on here is superb.  overall though, this album is excellent.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|This was my first Phil Collins album as a child, yes folks i'm young!... but I still remember listening to this at about age 10 or 12.  Even now it is one of my must have albums.  Great songs and great work!  Every hit you could ever want by phil's solo work.
B000GFLE86|5.0|This cd is delightfully lyrical with songs I enjoy even while reading.  Not too intrusive, the music lingers, however, in one's memory.  I have played it frequently, sometimes listening to the lyrics and other times, reading..  I heard Ms. Peyroux while shopping in a local health food store.  Asked the sales person who the singer was and then I ordered it from Amazon.  End of story.   Anna Seidler....
B000XPU5NY|5.0|With this double disk live set I was far impressed givin the age of these guys. I was really upset however when I first bought \\"Turn it on again tour edition\\" I was expecting at least a couple of live tracks. But, They fully fixed that with this cd set. This album will keep you on your feet and will bring it all back to you, for you older folkes. There isnt a complaint about this album, They even fixed the silence from track to track, as the way we walk had. (yay!) So anyone even thinking of buying this album, it's a must do. You won't be disappointed!
B00154GEFU|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album!  If you are a fan of the original Asia, don't hesitate to buy this.  And for those who think this is more a John Wetton solo album, that's ridiculous because having Wetton back at the forefront is the very reason this is worth getting.  It's still a band effort and it's great to see Steve Howe contributing a song or two that stand out in the bunch.  I was never a fan of the \\"other\\" Asia, so for me this is Asia coming back to how they should be known.    My favorite tracks keep changing (which is my litmus test for a great album), but the track \\"An Extraordinary Life\\" should very well be a hit song on par with any of their previous hits.  Don't expect that though, unless it gets placed in a commercial or movie.  Pick this one up NOW!
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|Shooter, starring Mark Walberg, brings to life Bob Lee Swagger, a character featured in many great books by author Stephen Hunter.<br /><br />Shooter opens with Swagger and parnter Donnie Fenn on a mission in Etheopia. Fenn is killed and Swagger returns home to a life of solitude. Men in government need a sniper to help them prevent an attack on the president of the United States. Swagger is the man for the job. He's the best there is. Something goes wrong and soon Swagger is a wanted man being pursued by law enforcement every where, including the shadowy group that originally hired him.<br /><br />Swagger has no where to turn except to Sarah (Kate Mara), Fenn's widow. Michael Pena also stars as Nick Memphis, a rookie FBI agent who actually believes Swagger could be innocent. Danny Glover does a great job as the villian. He is menacing yet stupid enough to believe he is above the law.<br /><br />This is a good movie. The action is great, the acting is superb and the plot holds up. While the bad guys may be involved with politics, this movie doesn't make a political statement. It sticks to the thrills. This is a movie where you'll get what you pay for, a straight forward thriller.

0385522401|5.0|The plot of this book is pretty well-publicized, so I hope I'm not spoiling it for anyone when I say that it's about a newly married couple in 1962 on their honeymoon, and the troubles they have with consummating their marriage.<br /><br />When I picked it up, I was astounded by how small it was. But like Susan Minot's Rapture, it is indeed a full book, despite the short page count. It has some other similarities to Rapture. It tells the story of a relationship in one sexual encounter using flashbacks. In the case of Chesil Beach, these are long, detailed, almost minute flashbacks. A few went on too long, but others broke my heart with their perfect, glowing moments.<br /><br />Both books illustrate that we can be as physically close as it is possible for two people to be, while having experiences that might as well be happening on differing continents for as much as they have to do with each other.<br /><br />The reviewers talk a lot about a novel of time and place, assuming that only in this genteel, quaint past could a couple not have slept together before their wedding night. I suppose that is extremely rare today. One review talked about the sexual silence of the day, the lack of a vocabulary that this couple could have employed to talk their way through this initial stumbling block and into happiness. And it's true that this couple is sexually innocent. What do young people know now, i wonder? Is anyone innocent to the degree this book portrays?<br /><br />But I still have to ask, is the book really that simple? Is it really just about how people didn't know what to say to each other about sex in 1963? I don't think so. if it were, it would have ended like Rapture, with the two people at the end of their attempt. Instead, it follows the young man into middle age, into time and experience and finally, a consideration of who he was, who she was, and how much he loved her. That part of the book is intensely bittersweet.<br /><br />Another part of the book spoke to me sharply. The young woman is a musician. She is pulled towards the world of her quartet, where \\"friends work together to solve difficult creative problems.\\" She wonders why that can't be the case in their marriage, why they can't pull together, but his pride is so damaged, his anger so self-righteous, that he has no sense of partnership with her at all.<br /><br />And there's this part:<br /><br />Whatever new frontier she crossed, there was always another waiting for her. Every concession she made increased the demand, and then the disappointment. Even in their happiest moments, there was always the accusing shadow, the barely hidden gloom of his unfulfillment, looming like an alp, a form of perpetual sorrow which had been accepted by them both as her responsibility. She wanted to be in love and to be herself, but to be herself she had to say no all the time. And then she was no longer herself. She had been cast on the side of sickliness, as an opponent of normal life.<br /><br />I don't know why this particular passage rang me like a bell, but it did. And it makes me believe that this book is about so much more than a lack of sexual vocabulary.usician.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|Excellent return for Evanescence!  Just the best female fronted band today.  Highly recommended!
B00154GEFU|4.0|What do you get when you mix together some Icon, a bit of Yes (Drama-era), a touch of ABWH, a smidgen of ELP, and a (sparse) amount of classic Asia?  You get...some Icon, some Yes, some ABWH, some ELP, and some Asia, thrown together on one album.    The classic Asia, which is what I and probably most other fans were hoping for, is scattered sparingly across Phoenix.  Only one complete song (Never Again) really sounds like something from the original album.  You get a few notes from The Smile Has Left Your Eyes in Heroine, and the middle part of the first trilogy, No Way Out, could have fit somewhere on Alpha - and that's about it for classic-sounding, driven, hard-rock/progressive Asia.    Wish I'd Known All Along sounds like it was imported from Drama, while Over and Over reminds me of a shorter piece from the original ABWH album.  Neither is too surprising, since these are Steve Howe's writing contributions to the album.  They're OK, but as one reviewer put it, Steve's musicianship trumps his songwriting.  Personally, I could have done with more of Howe's guitars throughout every song in place of his writing.    The second trilogy (Parallel Worlds/Vortex/Deya) sounds to me like John Wetton stepped in for Greg Lake in an ELP record.   Geoff Downes does an admirable facsimile of Keith Emerson in the Vortex portion of this piece.    The rest of the album could have been packaged as Icon III - and I probably would have been very happy with these songs in that context.     Taken as its own piece of work, this is a fine album.  The effort is clearly there, the musicianship is magnificent on all counts, and Wetton's voice has aged more gracefully than virtually every one of his contemporaries still putting out albums.  But I think we were somehow expecting this quartet to recapture the magic of the early days, and it didn't quite happen.  They need some more driving, \\"wall of sound\\" pieces, and Steve Howe's guitar needs to permeate everything more thoroughly.    I reallyhope these guys stick together for at least one more album, and try to capture that lightning in a bottle again.  They seem to be enjoying this time, touring more in the past year than I think they ever did in the glory days, so I hold out hope that they will find it in them to put their minds together one more time and truly give us a 1982-worthy bookend to their extraordinary careers.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|***I think it goes without saying that the five star reviews are for the movie and that this DVD release is 1 star.***<br /><br />Ghost in a Shell 2 (GIAS2) is spectacular eye candy but sadly the subtitles on the official release don't cut it forcing people to source better versions elsewhere. If you manage to get better subtitles then you will experience the full adventure of GIAS2.<br /><br />This is a very good sequel and makes especially great use of CGI combined with hand animation. Some of the scenes are rendered lavishly. While fans of the original may say that the story should have ended with GIAS1, GIAS2 doesn't really include much in reference to 1 except for some character backgrounds. Apart from that it's a whole new story.<br /><br />GIAS2 is about cyborgs' finding their implants being hijacked by what seems like criminal elements. Detectives investigate the crimes to uncover a conspiracy. The end twist is actually a knockout and makes it worth seeing. Some of the action sequences are mind-blowing. If you like Manga and are a GIAS1 fan, don't worry. GIAS2 far from disappoints. This is great entertainment and high calibre science-fiction through and through. It is not so often that you find the imagination so splendidly displayed on the silver screen.
0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert went through a heinous divorce and disastrous love-affair, then picked herself up and came up with a plan.  This book is the story of her plan: to live in three different countries and explore three different pursuits - pleasure, prayer, and the balance of the two. It is not meant to be an objective study of the places she visits, the situations of the people she meets, or the standard, socially accepted path to enlightenment via selfless charity.  It is just as it says it is: one woman's search.  Though Gilbert has flaws and struggles, she acknowledges them, and writes with honesty and humor, even about subjects that might make the more cynical reader squirm.  The result is a book that is hilarious, insightful, touching, and delightful.<br /><br /> First she goes to Italy and indulges her love of eating good food and her infatuation with the Italian language, trying to re-connect with personal pleasure.  Then to India for a stay at an Ashram to pursue her desire for peace and a closer relationship with God.  Finally, she goes to Indonesia, to learn from an ancient medicine man how to balance pleasure and spiritual peace.  During the year she progresses from sad and wretched to whole and healthy, traced in such a way that the reader feels it themselves.  Everything, with the exception of flash-backs to give some background, is about events as they happen, allowing the reader to go on the journey themselves and giving the book immediacy.<br /><br /> In fact, it is difficult to write about this book objectively.  At times the author's honesty is unnerving, as she discusses everything from thoughts of suicide to masturbation.  For those who are skeptical about the idea of God or very set in their ideas about spirituality, her in-depth examination of her beliefs and spiritual journey could be uncomfortable or silly.  Those considerations aside, it is still very difficult to discuss this book objectively because it is so affecting.  The pages are simply brimming over with good wishes, healing, and yes, love.  Personally, I enjoyed this book immensely, and found many of the author's personal demons and struggles to find peace to be the same as my own.<br /><br /> Gilbert writes about her search so well that she carries her readers along, just as so many others helped carry her.

0792839234|5.0|Don Coscarelli's intensely dreamlike \\"Phantasm\\" is a very original and startling horror film from the late 70's. A lot of horror classics were produced in the 70's, but this one in particular stands out because it is the only one that does not hearken back in some way to earlier established archetypes. All the details are more or less original.  The main baddie is an exceptionally tall undertaker from another planet, for starters. His dwarf slaves are essentially zombies (reanimated dead people he has crushed \\"down to half size\\") but in their behavior and appearance do not really resemble zombies from other myths. This is a movie trying to be as different as possible, with the goal of keeping its audience (that's us) unsettled and entertained.<br /><br />All the strange elements and images here add up to a high-octane creepy sense of the bizarre that, in my opinion, has never quite been matched.  But if you find yourself chuckling at the absurdities here and there--or just straight-up laughing--that's no accident.  There are some very funny moments (\\"Yahhhhh!! My FOOT, man!\\"), and these tend to hone the fine edge of the film's unpredictability.<br /><br />In the opening scenes, we see that spooky shenanigans are going on over at that Morningside Mortuary, including murder, appearances of strange hooded dwarf creatures, and kid-hero Mike (Michael Baldwin) riding his motorcycle around in the cemetery, apparently for kicks. After just a few minutes have elapsed, \\"Phantasm\\" is already a tapestry of weirdness, and it generally gets stranger as it goes along. The youthful hero Mike, in order to save his older brother and their friend Reggie from the eerie monsters invading their home town, is ready to jump into the action and fight.  Will the Tall Man, with his hordes of undead minions, be conquered?  With a villain this strange and this powerful, the efforts of our valiant 70's-macho heroes may not be enough.<br /><br />Not surprising that it was a big theatrical hit when it came out originally. It was totally unlike any other movie, and audiences could see clearly that this low-budget oddity was bending over backwards to deliver its roller-coaster-style entertainment.<br /><br />Excellent on DVD with its stereo-surround remix and special features.

But the original first film establishes the ambiguous myth in a pure, inspired way, and is the most perfect of the series.ly.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|With all that has been written on these boards and elsewhere,and now  excellently packed into the second disc of this DVD for instance the sheer scope of insights offered by lovers of this movie,it is becoming more and more difficult to add anything of substance that has not already been put forward as a means of explanation or reason for nearly every scene within the story.  However as an individual one great thing is the fact that however many times you see this brilliant DVD you will ask yourself new questions,and ask yourself what so many things contained within Donnie Darko actually mean or represent to you as an individual.  To myself this is one of the biggest joy's of the DVD,  I and i am sure many others come away with differing patterns and tracks of thought each time that it is viewed,even if it is viewed only once,  making it impossible not to become involved intimately with the script,words,and sights that you are exposed to each time you see this brilliant movie.

0307275639|5.0|Tuesdays With Morrie  Danny Cubberly  One could describe Mitch Albom in many ways.  He's a good listener, a good student, and an emotionally deep human being.  But most importantly, he was the student of someone he described as \\"a man who loved dancing and having a good time.\\"  This man was Morrie Schwartz.  Mitch Albom wrote down the lessons that Morrie would talk to him about every Tuesday.  Through those inspiring life-lessons came this story that teaches us all to live life to the fullest.   All the lessons in this book were inspirational.  Although Morrie was slowly wasting away with only months to live, he never felt depressed about his condition because he knew that this was his time to die.  There were several half-page chapters that could be interpreted as meaningless in others, but if one reads between the lines, they can interpret the message being sent by Morrie.  For instance, in one chapter, Morrie told Mitch that if he could be any animal, it would be a gazelle because they are \\"graceful and fast.\\"  This message can be interpreted as Morrie wishing that he could still have that energy he possessed before his diagnoses.     This book has several strengths, but with it come a few weaknesses.  Anyone who loves tear-jerkers and philosophical books should consider picking up this one-of-a-kind book.  This book will make anyone think back and remember that one special person who influenced them the most throughout their life.  Still, young people would most likely find this book sappy and dull, as it does not connect with the young, but more with adults and the elderly.  Whether it be the healthy or the unhealthy, the young or the old, this book will convince anyone that life is something that we need to love because it is all we have.  As Morrie's most famous quote says: \\"When you learn how to die, you learn how to live.\\"
0743289684|4.0|Infidel by Ayaan Hirsi Ali is the perfect out-look into a very different, intriguing life-style. Ayaan Hirsi cleary illustrates what her life was like growing up and living as a Muslim woman.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali is now known as a woman who has received threats for her life after she openly left the religion of Islam behind her, and argued about Muslim ways. However, after reading Infidel, it is evident that she wasn't always like this. In fact, you might be surprised at how religious Ayaan Hirsi Ali was growing up. She was a strong follower of Islam in her youth, she prayed to Allah five times a day, facing the holy city of Mecca. During her teenage years, rules of Islam were drilled into her head. For example, she learned that she in no way was superior to any male, and that she needed to cover her body, because if she didn't, she was committing a sin by tempting men with her looks. She was at first afraid to deny her religion. The Quran that she believed in told her hell was, \\"sores, boiling water, peeling skin, burning flesh, dissolving bowels, the everlasting fire that burns you forever, for as your flesh chars and your juices boil, your form a new skin. These details overpower you, ensuring that you will obey (Ayaan Hirsi Ali).\\"   After reading this book, there is a certain insight to Ayaan Hirsi Ali's life. It's clear that there are reasons for how she is today. In Infidel, the most interesting part of the book was when she went into depth about how she was treated. She told the brutal truth about every aspect of her life. After reading this book, it was so easy to respect her. She had so many difficult times in her life, from being outcast from her family for not marrying someone, to being beat so hard her scull was cracked. Although the book was very well written, there were some parts that didn't seem to work well in the book. For example, Ayaan Hirsi Ali included several insignificant details that did not deal with her main ideas. This made it difficult to read, along with the fact that she jumped around a lot, and had so many characters that it often became unclear who she was talking about. In the end, Infidel was definitely a book worth reading. It will change the reader's look on their life and the world in general.

B00000DGUG|5.0|When i first heard Alanis Morissette, it was in 1995 when \\"You Oughta Know\\" played on the radio.  My first reaction to Morissette and \\"You Oughta Know\\" was not positive. Most of the \\"bubble gum\\" and synth-pop of the 1980s was beginning to fade, yet Morissette's anger just seemed too raw for me to absorb at the time. However as the subsequent singles from Morissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" album were released, I soon began to see more than an angry young woman.   When I listened to \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" in its entirety, I realized that this album lived up to all of the hype.  When there is a monster album, expectations are usually through the roof for a follow-up album.  Thus there was a great deal of attention for Morissette's follow-up, \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" to continue the formula that worked so well on \\"Jagged Little Pill\\".   Instead of following the formula, Morissette would change the rules and go in a whole direction for \\"Junkie\\".    The result is that \\"Junkie\\" would not sell as well as \\"Jagged Little Pill\\".  However this is not a reflection of quality as Morissette once again hits the ball out of the park.    There are two big influences on this album.  First is the influence of Indian music.   Prior to the making of \\"Junkie\\", Morissette made a pilgrimage to India.  This trip to India might be the most significant one in music history since George Harrison's pilgrimage.  While some songs demonstrate an major Indian influence (such as \\"Baba\\"), I think the Indian influence is felt in one form or another on almost every track.     The other influence is that, Morrisette \\"turns things down\\" a notch.  While \\"Junkie\\" has a darker feel to it than \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", we find Morissette less angry and more conciliatory at times.    Glen Ballard,  the co-mastermind with Morissette on \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" once again returns as producer and collaborator (songwriting and instruments) on this album.   Ballard once again does a  very effective job as a producer and gets the most out of Morissette on each of these tracks.    Here is a track by track synopsis:    \\"Front Row\\": Great track and an underrated one in the Morissette portfolio.  The Indian influence is felt in the mantra-like feel to the whole song.  Listen to how beautifully the electric guitars blend in.    \\"Baba\\": The title of this song immediately shows an Indian influence. (I believe Baba means 'father').   Musically the song does have a Rock edge with some great electric guitars.  The lyrics here probably have more of the Indian influence than the musical sound - but subtly it still has a Indian rhythm.    \\"Thank U\\":  Great track that was a hit single from this collection.  Here we see a more concilitory Morissette as she issues many \\"Thank U\\"s.  Not only does Morissette thank India, but the mantra-like beat to this song showcases the Indian sound.    \\"Are You Still Mad?\\": On this song, we get to hear Morissette move away from her trademark raspy vocals with a more softer feel.   While Morissette isn't as angry, on this track she challenges her lover with \\"Are you still mad\\" while at the same time saying basically what amounts to \\"I told you so\\".  Great orchestration sounds close the track.    \\"Sympathetic Character\\": Another great track.   Here's another track with a mantra-like sound that shows some of the Indian music.  An innovative electric guitar solo highlights things at the end.    \\"That I Would Be Good\\": Showcases the softer Morissette again and gives Morissette to real demonstrate good vocal ranges.  While not angry Morissette finishes the song \\"I Would Be Good - whether with or without you\\"    \\"The Couch\\": The most interesting thing about this track is how there isn't a true chorus - despite the hooks in the melody.  The percussions definitely show some of the Indian influence.    \\"Can't Not\\": This song has an edgy alternative Rock feel showcasing some of Morissette's trademark raspy vocals.  This song has a bit of the mantra-feel, but listen tohow the song \\"switches gears\\" with some nice bridge midway into the song.    \\"UR\\": This track is a bit of a throwback to \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" with the use of the harmonica.  This track takes a bit, but it does grow on you.    \\"I Was Hoping\\": Morissette sings this song in the form of a story.  Not a strong Indian influence, but the beat does have a mantra-feel to it.    \\"One\\": Great song and another overlooked track.   It has a mantra-like feel and I think there is more Indian sound in this track than one might think.  Morissette also shows the conciliatory tone by singing \\"I have abused my power forgive me\\".    \\"Would Not Come\\"  Almost a cross of alternative rock with some Indian influences (mantra-like near chanting like lyrics and some percussions).   Some more great electric guitar work on this song.    \\"Unsent\\": A simple acoustic song, but lyrically genius.  No chorus on this one.  On this track, Alanis writes letters to her former lovers.  It's softer stuff, so no anger here. Great stuff.    \\"So Pure\\": Again a mantra-like feel to it and while it does have some Indian influence, it almost transforms itself into a near Irish folk sound toward the end.  Another great track.    \\"Joining You\\":  This is another great track.  I didn't hear as much as an Indian influence, but on this track Morissette gets the opportunity to showcase some great vocals, but this time against a harder guitar sound.    \\"Heart of the House\\": A softer sound with Indian and Orchestral sounds.   This is a good track, but not a great one.    \\"Your Congratulations\\":  While not the most exciting track, it's another opportunity for Morissette to show some great vocal ranges that aren't in her raspy voice.  Good string arrangements on this one.    The liner notes include all of the lyrics.   This album is definitely a worthy follow-up to \\"Jagged Little Pill\\".    If you overlooked this album, it's definitely worth checking out.  Highly recommended.

B000NDIAWY|5.0|I initially bought the CD, The Story, by Brandi Carlile because I was interested in only one song.  I had not known of her before.  I will say that I was extremely surprised at how much I enjoyed all the music on this CD.  Brandi has an exquisite voice with a wide vocal range.  I would recommend this CD to anyone.

1582701709|1.0|The Law of Attraction, concerning  \\"The Secret\\" is laughable at best. I am a firm believer of the power of positive thought but to imply that the Universe awards people with items, clothing, power, and money, simply because they think of them, is ridiculous.  With all the impossibly illogical and blatantly false religions that still occupy mainstream society, do we need another Cult of Stupidity? Buy this book for a good laugh, not for self improvement

B0013FXWU6|5.0|I was grinning with delight even before the first images of this incredible film appeared on the screen. The musical score -- an impressionistic mix of half-musical screeches and mechanical noises -- was an overpowering presence throughout the film. So much so that its occasional absence was jarring and unnerving. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" features a tour de force performance by Daniel Day Lewis as the monomaniacal oilman Daniel Plainview -- a man whose singleness of vision matches his surname. Indeed, Plainview has but one aim -- to become wealthy beyond imagining, to work devilishly hard to get there and to let absolutely nothing get in the way of his dream. Plainview is the epitome of the American character -- driven, relentless, brutal and dismissive of societal niceties, except insofar as they help him achieve his aims. His chief antagonist is Eli Sunday, the preacher son of a poor farmer. Sunday and Plainview each seek their own means to riches, and quickly become locked in a vicious pas-de-deux. Sunday needs Plainview to finance his church; Plainview needs Sunday's approbation to persuade his congregation to cooperate in his ventures. The tension between these two men becomes so overwhelming at times that I started to wonder whether there was an allegorical element going on -- religion v business -- or perhaps a commentary about the unholy alliance between commerce and the Cross in American culture.<br /><br />But TWBB is extraordinary on so many levels. The acting is superb. DDL molds his character into a natural force. His growling voice, perpetually sweaty face and cold eyes convey menace even when expressing the most banal of sentiments. The writing is phenomenal; the recreation of the turn-of-the-century Southwest is more than a little convincing. The depiction of the early, grueling methods of extracting oil from the ground is fascinating. The plotting never gives away the story arc, as periods of intensity and frenetic action are juxtaposed unpredictably against periods of reflection and preternatural quiet. There are many star performance in the film, but aside from DDL, kudos go to Dillon Freasier as Plainview's young, laconic son, H.W. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a masterpiece, an original, and tremendous ride through one man's personal obsession to succeed.eriods of reflection and preternatural quiet.

0316166685|5.0|Susie Salmon was as good as dead. She knew she was going to be murdered after the crime George Harvey had committed. At the tender age of fourteen, she was brutally raped by her adult neighbor and is promptly murdered and dismembered. At already the second chapter, we follow Susie up to heaven and watch the living world through her eyes.   In Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones, Sebold captures the terror and despair of being raped. Susie wasn't as lucky as Sebold, who was raped at the age of 18 during her freshman year at Syracuse University.   In The Lovely Bones, Susie is unable to tear her eyes away from her family and watches their lives unfold and crumble as a result of her disappearance and murder. Her father is deemed crazy for accusing George Harvey of killing his daughter and for attacking a girl in an open field at night. Her mother, Abigail, avoids her deranged husband and finds comfort in an affair with the policeman assigned to their case, Len Fenerman. She eventually leaves her family and moves to California. Susie's little sister, Lindsey, tries to break free of this spell Susie has cast on their household and tries to make people know her as `Lindsey Salmon' instead of `the dead girl's sister.' However, she finds it hard to just abandon this mystery and sides with her dad, eventually breaking into Mr. Harvey's house, desperately wanting to put this case to rest. Buckley, the youngest, tries to deal with a life without his mother, and he tries to put up with his father's obvious and never fading grief.   Susie watches. She watches Mr. Harvey as he lives as a quiet serial killer, and the reader watches with her. This tragic yet compelling book allows the reader to read through the eyes of a dead girl and watch as a guilty man gets away with murder.   Though the book is, overall, amazing and very well written, the ending is a bit foggy. It is unclear to the reader exactly how it ends, and if Susie stops watching her family or decides to continue on with her viewings.   Otherwise, it is a masterpiece. No doubt this was hard for a victim of rape to write, but Sebold clearly gets across what is going on in a victim's head at the time of the attack, and it is heartbreaking to be inside little Susie's head when this horrible crime is taking place.    Though Sebold describes the experience and aftermath more clearly in her memoir, Lucky, she uses The Lovely Bones to whisper the same message secretively to the reader, who walks away with knowledge that he never thought of receiving.
0316153907|1.0|This is a great book (as are all Michael Connelly's books).  This version is a big disappointment.  It is listed as a 1st edition hardbound book - but it appears to be a mediocre quality reprint - with no outer paper jacket sleeve, and a plastic coated hard bound front and back.  Save your money and buy it elsewhere.
0783231202|4.0|Historically accurate this in your ganeckdagazoink. It is like the intellectuals who pan 'Troy', either 1. because its not accurate historically,or 2. because it was a travesty to have Brad Pitt play the greatest warrior ever. That is neither here nor there, however magic comes sometimes when you least expect it. I believe firmly, that in the movie industry it is hardly ever about how talented you are, you can always, for the most part, hone the craft, but more about luck, as most professional actors (or struggling ones for that matter) will tell you. The right place, the right time, the right look, the exact moment you make a gesture in the hallway waiting for your 3 minutes to read two lines for a Dial Soap commercial and the casting director just happens to see your brow go up a certain distinct way, and Monday morning your agent calls you and you have the gig. Luck, hmmm it came crawling my way one brutal winter in New England.<br /><br />It was around five months after my return from film school in Manhattan, a good one too, I was arriving at 4:25 in the morning in my town I had lived in for 2 some-ard years, for make-up. Of all the movies I could have been in, of all the places I could have been that year, (I travel a lot), of all the names I would have loved to have graced the screen with, and of every director I would have love to have sat in awe and watched, I, (and it could have been eternal bliss from there if it were the last), was going to be in a Speilberg film. Clich&eacute;? Eh? Well I certainly hope so.<br /><br />It is very hard to detail to words the feeling on my skin, the way my shirt felt against my chest that day, the way my heart would actually sing as it beat inside my cocoon, walking up the long spiral staircase in the old city hall building which was made into a court house, knowing that on top of that building, somewhere in the oogles of background extras and the crew, lights and stands and sticks and gaffers and goffers and the like, I was in my element. I didn't tell anyone I went to film school, and that I had my DVD collection at home alphabatized by directors last name (lol), what did it matter, it didn't. But I Knew them all. Janusz Kaminski was on set, (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan cinematographer), Kate Capeshaw (Indiana Jones) Speilberg's wife was there, Debbie Allen, and her husband Norm Nixon, of course Matt McConaughey (who was unbelievably professional, it was stunning, as I was watching him in character prepare before entering for a movement take; wow it was as if he had left the physical and whoosh to another place al together, now that is preparing), Morgan Freeman (who was utterly rude to EVERYONE including the poor make up girl), David Paymer (Searching for Bobby Fischer) Stellan Skarsgard, and of course, mostly standing on the ledge overlooking Newport Harbor with a cig swinging from his fingers, was the elegantly voiced, Pete Postlethwaite. Oh Pete, I thought to myself, my shining star, that wonderful bliss that I was so young routing for you at the Oscars for In The Name of the Father, how much I was passionate about his craft.<br /><br />I will never forget one scene, and if you are familiar with the movie you can relate, when Jjimon Hounsou, the leader of the Africans slaves aboard La Amistad, has to rise above the orderly law and back and forth rebutalls, to say in English, 'I'm free, I'm free'. We must have did that take 30 or 40 times, probably five or six hours, and the mood in the courthouse was so intense, so amazing that everyone was simply stunned by the power of a few words, and when he had all the camera angles he needed and Djimon finally nailed it, Kate was in tears as was Debbie Allen and Speilberg, in a room filled with a silent hush that seemed to last for days, was the solitary word of 'wow'.<br /><br />As a principle extra for two months, not only in RI but also in CT, there was one moment in particular I would like to share with you, when the AD jetted all the non principals out of the courthouse, I somehow remained behind. My beard was designed in a pork chop way, where I sort of lingered behind with the principles and no one shoed me anywhere, and while Janusz and his crew reset the lighting for the next take, Matthew walked over to him in a poster size rolled tube, and he opened it slowly from the top, placed the white top cylinder on the old courthouse table, and opened a fairly large print of 'Empire of the Sun.' I almost gasped aloud. That too, was my favorite film of all time, that too ss what set me west young man, go west, and eventually to waiting tables and studying the craft at night waiting for the big break back in NY. He handed Steven a black sharpee and he signed away on the top left corner. I wonder all these years later, nearly 10 years plus, if it sits atop his mantle in his home in the hills or somewhere in the country. I was there that day, I was with some of the most brilliant minds in the film industry. I too, wonder if Matthew was inspired to be an actor from Empire. The Speilberg haters (which is the most ludicrous bunch of whack-jobs imaginable) can have their spew and vitriol, but being part of something tangible like that, and having someone like Steven as a mentor, albeit unknowing my whole life, made it something I will never forget for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Amistad alone tells a story, and one that is very difficult to relate to its audience. The courtroom scenes are tiresome and rough for a lot of movie goers, but if you can look past that for just one moment and see the raw, pinnacle acting that only someone that directs giants could produce and the immaculate word salad at the end of the film, that only Hopkins could achieve. The brutal, opening sequence alone, is enough to set you up for the often jaded slowness the movie can provide, but all in all, there are scenes where life itself can spew forth and invigorate all of us, like it did so many years ago, for myself,courthouse, I somehow remained behind.

0452289963|4.0|This is a good book, but I have only had a chance to read about 45 pages of it so far.....I therefore feel that I cannot justifiably review a book that I have only just begun.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!    The visual effects in this movie were very good, and once the action gets going, it never ends.  What this movie REALLY lacks is one original idea.    A group of young adults are video taping a very scary event.  Blair Witch rip off!  A monster destroys New York City.  King Kong rip off!  The monster has alien tick like beings which lay eggs in humans and rip their stomaches out from the inside.  Alien rip off!  The Statue Of Liberty's head is flying down the street.  The Producer admits he ripped this off from an Escape From New York poster.    The Producer takes the \\"Cloverfield\\" exit on his way to work everyday.  He couldn't even come up with the name on his own.      I especially liked the scene where the guy's cell phone battery dies, and they go to an electronic store to get a new one off the shelf.  \\"Hey genius... That one's not charged either!\\"      In the theater, I frequently found myself saying \\"take the Lincoln Tunnel, take the Tunnel out, and run to Pennsylvania!\\"      Gee, it sure seems like it didn't take that much time to mobilize a Military command force on Manhattan Island complete with tanks, troops in full body armor, and full aerial support on a weekend.      The Military scene leader just let's them go, and tells them when the last helo out will be?  I don't think so.    This movie runs for about an hour and a half.  Most camcorder tapes are only 60 minutes.  The movie should've been a LOT shorter.      On that note, the Human Race tends to be survivalistic.  In a crisis situation such as the events in this movie, I really doubt very many people would maintain the presence of mind to video tape the whole thing when their personal safety is at risk, especially the moron who was doing all the taping.  Example:  A big monster is about to eat you... Do you zoom in and adjust your focus, or do you throw the camera at the monster and run for your life?  I'd pick option B.      While we're on topic, why is it always New York City that gets destroyed in all the movies.  Why can't aliens destroy Dallas?  Now I'd pay to watch Dallas/Ft. Worth destroyed.  We've destroyed NYC in earthquakes, military attacks, aliens have destroyed it with an alien super weapon, monsters of all types have had their way with the island, floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, and Howard Stern have all reduced the city to cinders, and New Jersey seems to come out unscathed EVERY TIME.  We've seen this city destroyed so many times, that when it really was attacked, it just seemed like something else on TV during a 24 hour news cycle.      This movie had good acting and great production values.  I just thought it was very obvious that most elements of the film were ripped off from other films, and at times, it was difficult to watch because the camera was too shaky, and it randomly would skip over to what the event was taped over.  Cute idea, but I found it far too distracting for this type of movie.  That said... The action does tend to suck you in, and the visual effects and sound were well produced.  All in all, this would be a great rental.  I wouldn't feel my DVD collection was incomplete without this title.
B00005MCX2|4.0|I picked up many of the original Hawkwind albums on vinyl back in the day and found most of them enjoyable if rarely transcendant---too garagey despite their art/space rock pretensions.<br /><br />I heard from a pal recently that this is their peak so I got in the right mood and cranked it on the good headphones. All in all, certainly unique and occasionally masterfully weird and intense. But Floyd or Genesis or Yes this is not, in all the wrong ways.<br /><br />I'm sure the live spectacle was quite a trip, but the music alone is rather amateurish at times, sounding like a mediocre pub rock band more than once or twice. The lead guitar is laughable, in fact Lemmy's bass playing is the real highlight here at many moments, and even that is merely meandering. The background keyboard and delay-laden guitars make this work, when it does. Atmospheric weirdness is its strong point, not fine musicianship.<br /><br />And man do these guys depend on phasing almost every instrument for their \\"trippy\\" sound! All that phasing gets rather phasing at times.<br /><br />Some of the vocals are truly poor (often flat) but some are rather humorous, and Moorcock's lyrics and poems can be very amusing. They tend to diminish the peaks of the music by adding a comic book feeling, but taken in that light this is actually a very unique and entertaining collection of cartoonish visions of a space utopia. The poem on space itself is hilarious (\\"space does not love, space does not hate\\"). No one else ever made anything quite like this, so that in itself is an achievement in a world of cookie-cutter bands. These boys had imagination in spades, gotta give them that. Too bad the riffs and changes are so pedestrian.  Above all their tunes lack memorable melodies, which is why they are not as well-appreciated as Floyd, Crimson, Yes, Genesis, and a handful of others. I love some of this music but I really need more melody to get off completely than Lemmy, Dave and Nik can muster.<br /><br />I would however LOVE to see a dvd of these shows! Guess that won't be happening...but you never know what's in whose vaults. It's a shame if there is no video, these guys were true weirdoes at this point, in a mostly good way, and reached for the stars in their own warped fashion.<br />That's worth a lot in our little plastic world.<br /><br />This is certainly worth a properly modified listening session at substantial volume. Crank that sub!! Guess that won't be happening...but you never know what's in whose vaults. It's a shame if there is no video, these guys were true weirdoes at this point, in a mostly good way, and reached for the stars in their own warped fashion.

B000002UB3|5.0|What's not to get? Yes, Maxwell, and Octopus are a bit silly!  If you know their histort and you know where they were during this particular period, you'd understand that they needed a bit of silliness!  John was busy being '....Heavy\\" w/ Yoko and the peace movement; Paul was melting down, George wanted out, and Ringo wanted everyone to just get along.  There is not ONE piece here that if you listed to it, you wouldn't walk away humming.  This album is the epitome of the Beatles's Magic! It is just too bad it was the last of it.    \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" are two of George's best songs ever (and \\"Something\\" may be the single greatest love song ever)  \\"Oh Darling\\" is a bluesy masterpiece with Paul screaming with the best of them and showing why he will always be one of the best singers of all time.  The one who didn't really give his best effort was John (& I say that with love, as John Lennon has been a huge influence on my life!)   \\"Come Together\\" has a great riff, but he ended up getting sued over the lyrics by Chuck Berry (& I thought they were friends!)  \\"I Want You (She's so Heavy) again has a GREAT riff...slow and hard...driving and whirling to an abrupt end....but again....John...where's the Lennon wit??? (\\"I want you so bad it's driving me mad\\")  Mean Mr. Mustard is kind of cool, but seems like he cut it short to please someone else (Paul? George Martin?)  \\"Because\\" however, is an absolutely beautiful piece of work w/ some of their best harmonies ever...(which by the way are really showcased on this album very well)    Abbey Road is less about individual songs and more about the whole product: Less about the lyrics and more about the harmonies. And musically (both instrumentally & vocally), one of the greatest albums of all time!    But, again, it all just fits together...this is what a group should be about!  Where John didn't have his best day, Paul & George rode in on the white Horses.      I was very young when the Beatles broke up (10), butI do still miss them!
1582406723|5.0|Volume 1 (of 8 so far) collects 1-6 of Robert Kirkman's ongoing series for Image Comics.  I had been recommended this book by many people so I snagged the first 4 trades cheap and ate them up like a plate of warm brains.  Zombie humor.  Of course, there is really no humor to be found in this series.  It's gritty, rough and deeply interesting.  This book is not so much about the zombies as it is the human condition - and how quickly it corrodes under apocalyptic circumstances.  As is typical of Kirkman, the writing is excellent, building suspense and establishing characters while moving the story along at a satisfying pace.  If you read the first trade, you'll want at to have the next few handy.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Rush is a truly amazing group. Don't let the fact that they do some sequencing fool you! These are 3 of the best musicians in the world.  And I can say that knowing that it is nearly universally accepted as true!    \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" shows us an older, wiser, and kinda pissed off Rush!  With just enough humor of themselves to let you know to take them seriously, but not too seriously.  This is their best overall recording...(ah who am I kidding?) album since \\"Moving Pictures\\"  Gone is much of the 'restraint' they had shown on 'Counterparts' and they clearly don't care to write 'hits'.  The focus of each of these pieces is the form of each individual song.  Some people might think in parts they were too restrained because there was no guitar solo or the instrumentals (Malignant Narcissism) were too short....Again, they fooled you! Alex broke out with several different guitars and a couple rarely used instuments and he only has solos where the songs NEED them. Nothing is forced here!  Geddy's not screetching, but he doesn't have to...and there is not only fine melodies, but very interesting and unusual harmnonies. His bass playing is, well....as Geddy as ever!  Neil still gets off maybe even more than before, but he does it in short bursts; not all at once.  I should single out some other pieces;\\"Far Cry\\" is my personal favorite mostly because it rocks, but also because it sums up my life (one day I feel I'm on top of the world and the next it's closing in on me!)  \\"Armor & Sword\\" is probably the album's epic piece, There are 3 instrumentals which I found to be VERY intriguing; they had never done that before!  Working them Angels, Spindrift, and Faithless are all very well constructed songs. Everything you ever loved about Rush is here....they just don't announce it.  And after 35 years, they don't need to!
0064407667|1.0|I just read this in anticipation of it being an interesting series for my kids.  However, in this book, the children are abused, mistreated & at every turn there is no hope for them.  The lesson of this book seems to be that you cannot trust adults because they are so stupid and mean.  This book is not for adults or children.
0843176881|5.0|I am a nanny and the 6 year old boy that I take care of loves these books.  All the \\"Mr.\\" books are great.  My kids loved these when they were young too and that was 25 years ago!
0618680004|1.0|In his own words, Richard Dawkins' portrays himself as an intellectual elitist.   In discussing his role in EXPELLED Dawkins describes his interaction with Stein ...      \\"I still hadn't rumbled Stein, and I was charitable enough to think he was an honestly stupid man, sincerely seeking enlightenment from a scientist\\"  (source: [...]     Gag!!!       Incidentally, the 'honestly stupid' Stein graduated with honors from Columbia in 1966 and was valedictorian of Yale Law School (he graduated w/ Hillary).  He also served as a law professor at Pepperdine for 7 years, served in the administration of a former POTUS, is a featured writer for Yahoo finance, and has written 27 books.     The book is swiss cheese and Dawkins is an arrogent intellectual.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|you know whats crazy about this show is it really was my life. i mean i loved this show so much. it made me understand myself to see my self. if you never saw the show SHAME ON YOU!!! if you werent born when the show came out ok maybe you have an out but still SHAME ON YOU!!! i received this as a 26th bday gift, i cried like i was 15 again. It to this day is one of the best gifts i have ever gotten for my bday.     the show is truth, love, anger, hate, acceptance and above all understanding how maybe why it is the way it is. you are really able to see why you did what you did why we did what we did. its just your so called life.
B0012F9VS4|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old took great interest in this book from the first time we read it. He's still not quite putting together the fact that there is a baby in mommy's belly, but he seems very excited to be a big brother now. He definitely likes the distinctions of what he can do that the baby will not be able to do.
B0013FBS20|4.0|What a great movie! I can't believe the blu-ray version looks better than when I saw it in IMAX. Great movie, people really need to start getting more blu-ray movies for their collection. Ever since I saw I AM Legend in Blu-Ray I will never buy a regular dvd again
B0013FBS20|5.0|This is a great movie, and Amazon.com shipped it fast. I had it within 5 days of purchasing it, and the prices are great. At any other store I would have paid $30, but with Amazon.com I only paid a little over $20 including shipping!
B00005JMYI|4.0|Anchorman is the story of Ron Burgundy and his legacy as an anchorman on the channel 4 news time that frequents the number one spot in the ratings. His news team includes the sports newscaster, Champ Kind, the investigative reporter, Brian Fantana, and the weatherman, Brick Tamland. In this era of newscasting, only men were allowed to read the news. So what'll happen when Veronica Corningstone enters the picture? A woman who has the experience and the dream of becoming a network anchor. Will that dream come true? As Bob Dylan said, \\"the times they are a'changin'.\\" Anything can happen and it's something you're going to have to deal with.<br /><br />Reviewing Anchorman is more difficult than it looks. While it's one of my favorite movies, it's so incredibly random. There is a plot, but it takes a backseat to the memorable and hysterical one-liners from the film that had to be improvised at times. With a movie that's this spontaneous, it's a bit hard to comment on things like the story since it's kind of minimal in a movie like this. The actors who make up the channel four news team portray these characters pretty flawlessly in the film though. They're pretty absorbed in these roles and that's a good thing. It makes this ridiculous movie somewhat believable.<br /><br />Now I've been a Will Ferrell fan for quite awhile now. He's made some pretty hilarious movies in his career, but this one was the last comedy he did that I really enjoyed. Every comedy he's done after this followed the same kind of formula; little plot and a lot of random one-liners and jokes that seemed to come out nowhere. It's funny the first time around and decent the second time, but after that it gets really redundant. People may find that flaw with this film, but I personally enjoyed it. The movie has almost a cult status for its ridiculousness alone. It's not only a film that continued my appreciation for Will Ferrell, but made me a fan of Paul Rudd as well.<br /><br />Anchorman isn't really a movie for everyone. If you're looking for a film that has a good story, a lot of character development, or a steady buildup towards anything worthwhile then this isn't the movie for you. This is the type of movie that is designed just to make you laugh. You're not really supposed to think about what's happening or why it's happening. You're just supposed to have fun with it and enjoy the moment at hand. If you can follow something like Family Guy and laugh at the humor in that, then you shouldn't have a problem with Anchorman. You'll enjoy the comedy for what it is and like it says in the narration at the beginning of the film, you'll probably wind up thinking...one anchorman was more man then the rest. His name was Ron Burgundy. He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo. In other words, Ron Burgundy was the balls.'re looking for a film that has a good story, a lot of character development, or a steady buildup towards anything worthwhile then this isn't the movie for you.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|I got this as a gift for my brother and does he love it ...it sure was a hit with him...i watched it also and it was great....you can't go wrong with these gals they are just great....
B000BGR0OM|3.0|I am a Eurythmics fan to the max.  I have listened to them for so many years.  I have most all of their recordings.  The reason I did not give this collection 5 stars is because I think if you are a collector like I am you would be better served to buy the origional albums so you get many other songs that are not on this cd.  (All my old collection is on tape so its time to get a new collection on cd)  But if you just want a sample of them the collection is fine.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|I am a military fanatic I am all for our troops I love all movies that suggest military anything. This movie was a great movie some might think its slow though and not a great story line but it was a good \\"blowin **** up\\" movie :)
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I must say that when I saw this, and probably still to this day, Brick was one of the most outstanding films I had seen in years.  The storyline, character development and music are just some of the finer points.  If youre into noirish outside of the box stories, then definitly check it out.
1592332803|5.0|This is the best BAKING book I've ever seen, much less Vegan baking. Colleen has so many wonderful helpful tips for each recipe to make sure that they turn out the best possible. After taking a cooking class from her while in San Francisco, we couldn't WAIT for her cookbook to come out and now eagerly await her next cookbook.  We tried to buy it right away but they were SOLD OUT instantly and we had to wait for the next order.  Colleen is an inspiration and a wonderful creative cook. I have made over 20 recipes from this book already and every one has turned out perfect and had rave reviews.  I used it for all of my holiday baking for non-vegan family and everyone loved it.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I looked forward to this DVD release ever since Stargate SG1 regular series ended.  It did not disappoint.    The only thing missing was Jack O'Neill, and then the movie would have been perfect.      That aside, the story pulls all the ORI threads together to a satisfying resolution.  The CGI effects are especially impressive.    I was a bit puzzled with the introduction of a second \\"bad guy\\" storyline, and would have liked to see more of the cool Asgard technology.    But, I've watched it two or three times now. You can tell the cast and crew have a wonderful time working together, and have built long-term relationships.     Because they have fun, we, the viewers, have as much (if not more) fun watching.
0060578793|5.0|Simply put, this is the best survival guide on the market today. Bar none. I am a veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Army. Even the US Army Survival Manual is not as comprehensive as this guide.
0452289963|5.0|Great reading that makes you think about your life and the choices you have to make it a beter life!
6304493681|4.0|I'm not a big fan of anime, but I am a fan of Sci-fi. This film is very good. I reminded me of \\"Blade Runner\\". One of my favorites. I've heard comparisons to the \\"Matrix\\" films. I guess because of the whole cyberpunk aspect. Humans \\"jacking\\" into a computer with the use of an interface plugged into the brain, has been used in literature for years before this film. All things considered, this film is a treat for ears, eyes, and brain. It's thought provoking, and beautifully rendered. There is some nudity, and gore. Not intended for children.
B0006J28BO|5.0|Based on other reviews of this, and knowing Miyazaki was not at the helm for this one, I was a bit worried about its quality.  But it's the only Ghibli movie we didn't have, so we got it for our son's b-day.    Other than the awkward transitions from scene to scene (the screen goes black for a few seconds, as if it were about to cut to a commercial (!), the movie was quite up to the normal Ghibli standards.  The animation was good (nothing IMHO measures up to \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" as far as animation goes) and the story was remarkably good.  It was a very uplifting story.  People on IMDB are always complaining about the English dubs of Ghibli films, but we thought the voices were fine.  We don't speak Japanese anyway, so we'd never really be able to tell if the voices were dubbed \\"wrong\\" or whatever.    Highly recommended.  We all liked it much better than \\"Whisper of the Heart,\\" which was the first Ghibli movie featuring the \\"Baron\\" cat character.  This movie is not a sequel - other than the Baron, nobody from \\"Whisper\\" is in it - and contains its own good story.
B00003CWPL|5.0|It has always amazed me that this film was made (over a period of 5 years) back in the early 1970s. David Lynch was just a kid! The utter darkness, dread, and black humour he captured is incredible! Henry Spencer (Jack Nance), with his mountainous hair and dire expression, embodies the cold emptiness of a world laid waste. He roams the rotting, rusting landscape like a ghost, drifting from place to place, uncomfortable no matter where he winds up. Henry is anyone who has ever felt completely out of synch, out of place, out of time. He represents my own insecurities, fears, and general unease. Ever felt like you were on the wrong planet? Welcome to Henry's world. Parental responsibility (curse of the mutant offspring), family (dinner w/ the x-family), passion (the affair w/ the hot, dangerous neighbor), etc. are all just hideous pieces of the terrible whole. Henry is a soul in hell, a man trapped in a mobius-strip of nightmare. Filmed in black and white, the atmosphere is palpably toxic! ERASERHEAD should only be seen by those who enjoy their comedies blacker than tar! To me, it's a bloody masterpiece...
