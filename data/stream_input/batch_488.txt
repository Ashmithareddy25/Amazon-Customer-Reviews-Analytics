B00000K3CR|4.0|Tom Hanks is the grown-up man with the 13-year-old mind. As aboy he makes a wish in front of a carnival fortune-telling machine to be big, and his wish is granted (physically but not mentally). He goes on a search to find the machine to change the wish; in the meantime he gets a job with a toy company. Basically the movie then becomes one long joke about a \\"child\\" in the adult world, but it tends toward other issues, too - the loss of innocence and that surface honesty that is so prevalent in childhood and then disappears in adulthood. Hanks, of course, is a hit at the toy company (what 13 year old wouldn't be?). But he falls in love with a co-worker, which makes the decision to go back to 13 again at the end more heartrending. Hanks is very good in this child's role. Worth a watch.
B00003CXV4|2.0|I'll admit that I am not one for love stories. I watched this because of Keanu Reeves. I was untouched by Sara's and Nelson's (Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves) romantic interlude.  Sara's and Nelson's relationship starts off with them being at odds with each other and then it,eventually, develops into one of friendship and love. Charlize's character is that of a dying woman who is trying to live the last of her days by developing a relationship with a man a month and then sending them on their way. She does not want Nelson to be a part of her dying because she wants him to remember their relationship( and her) as one that was beautiful and happy. I did not find that to be touching. I saw it as an act of selfishness and unbelievable. Keanu Reeves' character ( Nelson) was one of a high strung, uptight, money making executive who later adapts the unconventional, bohemian lifestyle of Sara's out of love for her. I found Reeves to be out of his element as an actor, and his performance as a romantic fell flat. In her efforts to portray a free-spirited, uninhibited, happy-go-lucky person,Theron comes across as silly and extremely irritating. Her character is unbelievable as she gives Nelson's expensive clothes to a homeless guy and gives Nelson less expensive casual duds that belong to her gay friend. In my opinion, I feel that Reeves and Theron both did a poor job of portraying their characters, and I simple disliked the movie. I gave the movie  2 stars, only, because I find Keanu Reeves to be very handsome, and I enjoy looking at him. There was nothing else about this movie that I liked. It was difficult to get through.
B00003CXC6|5.0|A nobleman and his wife are attacked by a bandit deep in the forest; the woman is raped, the nobleman killed (or is it suicide?). The bandit, the wife, the nobleman's ghost, and a woodsman who discovers the aftermath (or witnesses the whole thing?) tell their version of the crime, and each is very different from the others. Kurasawa is exploring what truth is and to what extent will someone twist it to protect oneself. It's a great idea, but what really makes the picture work so well is that through each version of the story the characterizations deepen and become multi-layered. Only the very ending, which seems to be more about selfishness than truth, might their be a misstep; otherwise the movies is perfect. Deservedly a classic, and devastating in its message of mistrust. Definitely worth a watch.
B000069HKH|2.0|Anyone who thinks Bruce Springsteen is talented must be tone death or must think 1st Grade Poetry is great. That said, \\"The Rising\\" is a thoughtful rock anthem that brings Bruce back to his glory days. \\"Mary's Place\\" is also decent. Unfortunately, this album smells like a desperate attempt to exploit all the 911 victims.
B00005NVDF|5.0|A Woody Allen movie set in San Francisco? Not in NYC? A sure-fire signal that something unusual, maybe even special, is in the works. Allen tries to emulate tough guy Humphrey Bogart to win over women after his wife divorces him. Diane Keaton plays the wife of his best friend who tries to help him along, and they end up falling for each other. The scene where Keaton comes over to Allen's apartment where they are to be introduced is absolutely hilarious, with Allen at his bumbling best. The finale has Allen giving Keaton up in a fog-bound airport, just as in CASABLANCA. As was becoming typical by this time in his career, Allen spends much of the picture ranting about his anxieties and failures, and the self-deprecating humor, especially in the slap-stick routines, is a riot. Definitely worth a watch.
B00008S2VG|3.0|Anybody who thinks Madonna is not talented should get a hold of her \\"Reinvention Tour\\" DVD when it comes out, which, judging by her decisions recently, might be eight years from now. That said, \\"American Life\\" doesn't live up to my defense of Madonna. In fact, she almost gives into her idiotic critics by singing in her chirpy voice, writing insanely childish lyrics, and..oh my gosh...rapping! The cd also has it's gems as well. \\"Nothing Fails\\" is the most beautiful song Madonna has performed since \\"Rain.\\" \\"Intervention\\" is a well written song and \\"X-Static Process\\" is tear jerkingly beautiful. \\"Easy Ride\\" could have been a classic, but the computer bleeps ruin this otherwise great song. I can only hope that Madonna learns from the mistakes she made on this record to produce a classic album like she's used to, hopefully soon.
B0007OCG56|5.0|This movie is refreshing to watch. If you enjoyed As Good As it Gets, you will enjoy this one. You will laugh, cry, and taste a bit of bittersweet.
B000001Y42|5.0|This disc is one of my favourites. Lot's of great tunes on here. I would reccomend pre ordering the new album (The Unquestionable Truth Part One) as well as this. If you want to hear a new track that will be on the album head over to limp bizkit's website and listen to \\"The Truth\\". Amazing track.
1573223085|5.0|Dan Pink's book \\"A Whole New Mind\\" has joined my `must have' list for my MBA students. It joins \\"Cluetrain Manifesto\\", \\"Rules for Revolutionaries\\", and \\"Crossing the Chasm.\\" <br /> 5 star reviews that have preceded me, have explained the outline and thrust of the book quite well. I concur with them. <br /> One highlight item that I would add, is when Pink went to India and met brilliant MBA's that make $14,000 per year, and enjoy a lifestyle at relatively 10x in many measures to the US worker at $25,000. <br />It is refreshing to have a journalist put names, and faces, and dreams to some of the emerging high middle class of India. <br /> <br /> Pink is not being a 21st Century `Cassandra' by detailing his three \\"A's\\" of Asia, automation, and abundance.  His early chapters lay out the threat and opportunity of Asia creating tens of millions of middle class workers and entrepreneurs, in India and China particularly.  His general data and postulations for automation and abundance are spot on. <br /> <br /> But rather than write a book like Reich or Thurow, demanding protectionism, Pink devotes roughly 2/3's of his book on what a thoughtful US or EU citizen should do, or assist their children in doing or learning to do. <br /> In the later half of the book, Pink outlines and defines how Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, and Meaning will give \\"First World\\" citizens the acuity to respond to globalization, rapid technological change, and changing demographics. <br /> <br /> I was very fortunate to meet Dan Pink in Phoenix, the week beginning his book tour. His speech for 80 to 100 Phoenix based designers and graphic artists, was terrific. <br />His line of the `MFA is the new MBA' was the key tag line, that caused many of the artists in the room, and all the `quants' in the room to recognize they have a `designed' and collaborative future together. <br /> It is my hope that this book will have the wide audience that Alvin Toffler's `Future Shock' had, decades ago. Pink's device of the `Conceptual Age' following the `Information Age' might just earn him a citation in the pattern of Tom Wolfe, who labeled the 1970's as the \\"Me-Decade\\". <br /> I highly recommend the book.  As a graduation gift for high school, college, and graduate students, I recommend it even more.
1401201911|5.0|I am not a fan of  \\"Elseworlds\\" books, they usually fall flat.  This one however...<br /><br />...is GREAT!  \\"Superman: Red Son\\" is compelling from beginning to end.  Mark Millar had a tall order with this, re-imagining the Man of Steel as the poster-boy for socialism.  The story heads in directions that you wouldn't expect, Millar adds several great twists.  Johnson and Plunkett's concise, beautiful artwork serves the story well.  They cleverly depict several alternate versions of DC heroes and villians.  There is a great  \\"sketchbook\\" in the back of this trade paperback, showing the evolution of some of these characters.<br /><br />I couldn't disagree more with the \\"spotlight review\\" by Antonio Nunez.  To discuss the plausability of any Superman book is ridiculous.  His entire existence is implausible.<br /><br />Order this book, you'll love it.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This album is a mixture of various types of music (latin, prog, jazz, rock, funk, etc.). It takes a few listens to fully appreciate it, but it is well worth it. Highly recommended for those who like prog rock with a distinct flair!
B000066NW0|1.0|Warning: This review is intended for mature audiences only. ... OK, now that all the seventh-graders have left... I only had to read three or four reviews to gather proof that pretty much only the twelve-and-under crowd: a.) actually like this garbage, and b.) take the time to review this garbage. Actually, a thirty-something friend of mine actually bought in to Avril's \\"teen pop-punk-wannabe-princess masquerading as an angst-filled adolescent\\" so-called \\"music\\"(shame on him) and he burned me a copy just to let me hear it. I decided, OK, I'll be fair, let's give it a chance, see what it's like. After six or eight songs in I ripped that evil disc out of the player and chucked it out the nearest window. What a load of crap. I'm 99 percent certain that some slimey record executive (who would have to be a marketing genius to have successfully foisted this little twit upon us) knew that the world wouldn't want another Brittany or Christina (guess I was wrong, we got Jessica and Ashley), so he invented this weird \\"persona\\" for Avril just so she could sell. And sold she has, as in sold-out. Just look at how many magazine covers her face has graced. No matter what you call it or how you dress it up, it's just a bad product. Stay as far away from this one as humanly possible.
0800141806|5.0|When watching a movie like PHILADELPHIA, one can't help but awed by the talent involved in this devastatingly excellent film.  Director Jonathan Demme has assembled a cast to die for and with an intelligent, provocative, and thoughtful script, he has given us one of the best \\"message\\" films ever committed to celluloid.  Whether or not you are heterosexual, homosexual, a gay rights activist or an out and out homophobe, you can't help but be impacted by the power of this movie.<br /><br />Of course, Tom Hanks shines in a brave role, a risky role that Hanks elevates to heights of greatness.  Hanks has given us so many outstanding performances through his career:  Big; Saving Private Ryan; Cast Away; Forest Gump; Apollo 13; Road to Perdition; Green Mile; etc., etc.  Tom has the ability to not only portray a character, but to inhabit him as well.  Tom's soliloquy while listening to the beautiful piece by Maria Callas is devastating; his faltering moments in the courtroom are heartwrenchingly real.  It is truly an Oscar worthy performance.  Equally impressive is Oscar winner Denzel Washington, crimefully neglected at Oscar time for this one; I think it's Denzel's most powerful and controlled performance.  Initially a diehard homophobe, he is able to arrest these reservations and work hard to help Hanks win his case.  His reactions during the aforementioned Hanks soliloquy prove how good actors don't need to say a word to show what they're feeling.  And what a marvelous supporting cast:  Joanne Woodward is superb in her small but wonderful performance as Hanks' mother; Antonio Banderas, eschewing his pretty boy persona with a direct and honest portrayal of Hanks' lover; Jason Robards hiding behind his own homophobia and judgmental religious fervor; Kathryn Witt in her small role as the aids-infected lady who wasn't fired because it wasn't her fault she had AIDs.  The entire cast down to the smallest of roles is mesmerizing.  The actors playing Tom's family are marvelous.  The musical score by Howard Shore, and the Oscar winning title song by Bruce Springsteen complement the movie tremendously.<br /><br />PHILADELPHIA is one powerful movie; one that will make you examine your own prejudices; Hanks was really being tried for his lifestyle; his final scenes with his family and especially Banderas are beautifully done, and the movie proves what a remarkable actor we have in both Hanks and Washington.  Truly a classic for our times.usical score by Howard Shore, and the Oscar winning title song by Bruce Springsteen complement the movie tremendously. <br />PHILADELPHIA is one powerful movie; one that will make you examine your own prejudices; Hanks was really being tried for his lifestyle; his final scenes with his family and especially Banderas are beautifully done, and the movie proves what a remarkable actor we have in both Hanks and Washington.

B0006213WG|5.0|This CD is absolutely amazing. The other Sum 41 Cd's had a few songs on them that were good, but this Cd is completely good. Every song is very good, and I must admit that the song \\"No Reason\\" is perhaps my favorite. It has a catchy chorus and just a great song in general. Plus they have a few ballads on this album that are absoultely wonderful. This Cd is definitely worth it. If you like Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\" I definitely would recommend you check this out as well because they both go hand and hand.
B00000AFFI|5.0|After delivering what many would consider to be the most prominent album of her career, PJ Harvey fled from the spotlight and lived for three and a half years in virtual isolation on her parents' farm in Yeovil. The album she produced when she resurfaced lacked the bluesy punk-riffs and tongue-in-cheek lyrics of her earlier albums, utilizing instead experimental fuzzy guitars and synthesizers. It was brief, complex, evasive, and rife with subtly rendered emotional distress. It was also, in my opinion as well as (I have read) Ms. Polly Jean's, her most finely-crafted album ever. <br /> <br />1. Angelene-A slow, folksy ballad that seems to be about a wayward woman who gives herself over to many men while secretly pining for an overseas lover. It features Harvey singing plainly and simply in a husky voice. Some of the lyrics are thought to pay tribute to a J.D. Salinger short story entitled \\"Pretty mouth and green my eyes\\", which is directly quoted at one point in the song. <br /> <br />2. The Sky Lit Up-This song is very short. It seems to be about someone enjoying a happy night on the town and yet at the same time, there seems to be something awry about it. It ends with PJ Harvey wailing, \\"the sky lit up\\" in a high-pitched tone. <br /> <br />3. The Wind-A very quiet song with verses told in hushed whispers and a chorus that is delivered in a haunting tone; very ominous. <br /> <br />4. My Beautiful Leah-Another short one. This song has these weird fuzzy guitars playing in the background which, in conjunction with Harvey's drone, give it a numbing atmosphere so that one can almost envision her stumbling around on a dark night trying to find the girl she is looking for. <br /> <br />5. A Perfect Day, Elise-An incredible song. There is something about the explosion of trippy chords at the beginning of this song which always makes me want to get up and dance (and no, I'm not trained in that discipline so I resist the urge). This is one of those songs that I can listen toover and over again. The most intriguing thing about it is that it seems to be such a happy song but if you listen closely to the lyrics, the main character actually commits suicide in the end, rendering the whole song almost sarcastic. Allegedly, this song is based on another J.D. Salinger story entitled \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\". <br /> <br />6. Catherine-Another incredible song, only this one is dark and full of yearning, probably the broodiest song on an already broody album. One cannot help but love how the tension builds as Harvey moans, \\"I envy the road, the ground you tread under...\\" in what I am told is classic Billie Holiday style, only to culminate in the curse, \\"Til the light shines on me, I damn to hell every second you breathe...\\" This song contains some lyrics that resemble quotes from Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS. <br /> <br />7. Electric Light-This song was harder for me to get into. It is very quiet and the lyrics are delivered in a sort of murmur with those fuzzy guitars humming in the background. The lyrics are somewhat powerful yet delivered unassumingly. I like this song just not as much as a lot of the others. <br /> <br />8. The Garden-PJ Harvey returns to her biblical roots with this song about a liaison in a garden of good and evil. To be honest, this is another one that I didn't get into as much, but it's still decent. <br /> <br />9. Joy-A very difficult song, delivered in a screechy wail that is almost impossible to listen to yet demands to be hard all-the-more. The instruments in this song include more off-beat guitars as well as rattling drums that sound almost like broken pipes or other industrial equipment. This is certainly a disturbing song, allegedly, it pays homage to a Flannery O'Connor short story. Not one of my favorites, but still desperate to be heard. <br /> <br />10. The River-One of the most powerful tracks on the album and the longest as well. One cannot help but feel psychological cleansed as PJ Harvey repeatsagain and again, \\"Throw your pain in the river\\". It ends with a haunting brass instrumental part. This song also is supposed to be based on a Flannery O'Connor story of the same title. It was this song which inspired me to buy this album. One of my favorites. <br /> <br />11. No Girl So Sweet-For me, this is the most harrowing song on the album. It starts off with weird squeaky beats and then has PJ Harvey singing in a fuzzed-over, anguished roar/wail. I think everyone can identify with lines such as: \\"How much more can you take from me? I'd like to take you inside my head. I'd like to take you inside of me.\\" This song is yet again thought to be inspired by a Flannery O'Connor story. Another one of my favorites on the album; quite disturbing, but great. <br /> <br />12. Is This Desire?-The final, titular track on the album. For the first twenty seconds all you can hear is a very soft humming noise, then gradually Polly starts singing and the song slides into gear in a manner that is both elusive and seductive. I cannot tell if this song, with its references to Joseph out in nature has any Biblical allusions, but it is certainly menacing and questioning at the same time. An apt conclusion. <br /> <br />When I first bought this album, I was somewhat disappointed. Now, I think it is my second favorite album of all-time. My advice would be not to give up on it easily. No, it is not initially as striking as some of Harvey's other works, but instead it will subtly slip under your skin until you find yourself embedded in the madness of the world Harvey is creating. This album is supposed to be Harvey's tribute to literature and judging from the number of derivations from classical works, not to mention the incredibly broody, morose nature of this album, that would certainly make sense. This is PJ Harvey in third-person, no longer revealing personality traits but whole people. One of my favorite things about this album is how so many of the songs seem so ordinary and serene yet if you listen closely, you realize there is something not quite right about them. In fact, there is something horribly disturbing and depressing about all of them. <br />
B0000700KL|5.0|Never in my life had I sat with my eyes riveted to the screen, so afraid to miss one second of the visually stunning imagery that I didn't even want to blink.
B0007Q6QVO|5.0|Since I live in the US, I don't have the album yet and I'm not sure when I'll get it, but I'm writing my review using the 1 minute clips on her official site of all 12 songs ([...]) Anyway, Melanie C is back and better than ever with her third album Beautiful Intentions, produced by her new record label, Red Girl Records, which she made after being dropped from Virgin after the flop of her second record Reason. This album just may be the one to put her back on the map and show everyone what she's capable of.  <br /> <br />1)Beautiful Intentions- The title track opens with a hard guitar riff and really brings you into her new hard rock sound. This song is about being able to see whether or not someone likes you. \\"So blind that I can't decide if you knew I harboured beautiful intentions for you/So cruel that I never knew truly if you harboured beautiful intentions for me\\" 5/5  <br /> <br />2)Next Best Superstar- The first single off this album, which talks about the whole Pop Idol/American Idol phenomenon and this song really takes a bite at the whole pop culture. \\"Make a joke, do the show, where does all the money go?/You're living your dream/Crack a smile in denial, throw your morals on the fire/You're living your dream.\\" 5/5  <br /> <br />3)Better Alone- The first of very few ballads on this album, which shows the more mellow, softer side of Melanie that we saw in her Reason album. 5/5  <br /> <br />4)Last Night on Earth- The kind of fun rocker song on the album (all of them are fun, but this is the funnest of them all) that makes you want to rock out. 5/5  <br /> <br />5)You Will See- Getting deeper and deeper into the rock sound, You Will See is another one of my favorite songs. \\"Cos it's only a matter of time til it finds you/Try to run for your life, you'll still feel it behind you/You will see.\\" 5/5  <br /> <br />6)Never Say Never- One of my favorite songs on the album, this song has a great rocker sound and Melanie's vocals are really good on this. 5/5  <br /> <br />7)Good Girl- When I first heard this, it was one of my least favorite songs on the album, but after several listens, it's beginning to grow on me. This is another ballad and has a very mellow sound to it and Melanie's vocals are pretty good on this song too. 4/5  <br /> <br />8)Don't Need This- After having heard Lisa Marie Presley's new CD, this sounds like it could have been on that record as well, but it fits very well on here. \\"Now I'm planning my attack and I will surely rise again/Running from yourself isn't gonna save you.\\" Great rocker song and another of my favorites. 5/5  <br /> <br />9)Little Piece of Me- Yet another favorite song of mine and it's a great rock song. Melanie sings very well on this song. \\"All you want me to be is a little souvenir/Of a night you won't even remember/It's not because I'm worth it, not cuz I deserve it/You just want to get your hands on a little piece of me.\\" 5/5  <br /> <br />10)Here and Now- A haunting melody begins this song and then moves into a more mellow ballad. It's another song that may take a while to grow on me. 3/5  <br /> <br />11)Take Your Pleasure- We move back to the rock sound into my final favorite song on the album. This song is about someone taking pleasure from Melanie's pain. \\"You take your pleasure from my pain, inflict your damage/I expect your delusion is part of you hating yourself, so take your pleasure from my pain.\\" 5/5  <br /> <br />12)You'll Get Yours- The final song on the album is a beautiful ballad which really shows off Mel's vocals well. \\"If you turn the pages and look inside, there is nothing of me I feel that I have to hide/If you turn the tables and look at yourself, is there something you fear that you would have to confess?\\" 4/5  <br /> <br />Overall, this album is one of the best I've heard in a while, not only from Mel but from the whole music industry. Having written all but one track (Next Best Superstar), Melanie is definitely showing off her lyricism and it really seems to be improving from album to album. It shows she has put so much work and effort into this album, crafting it to be the best. I can't wait to get this album.
038572179X|5.0|Something happened at my work recently in which someone really scrwed up. I was reading this novel at the time. The approach of the novel suggested I try to imagine my co-worker's behvavior from his perspective. I did, and it really helped me in dealing with the clean-up of the mess and in confronting the person. There is often a narrative that explains actions that seem to have evil intent, but don't. This novel gives us a rich canvas on which we can explore this message and many others.<br /><br />Thank you Ian McKewan for writing a novel that changed me.<br /><br />The audio version read by Jill Tanner is fantastic!

B00028HBKM|2.0|Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" was probably one of the most controversial films of the year 2004. The film had many critics of all stripes praising or damning the work for a variety of different reasons.  <br />   The most common criticism concerned Gibson's treatment of the Jewish authorities who demanded Jesus' death. This being a cinematic version of a \\"Passion Play,\\" staged shows depicting the suffering and crucifixion of Jesus, presented around Easter during the Middle Ages on. These productions were notorious for placing the blame of Jesus' death on the Jews and would reportedly lead audience members to track down Jews with harmful intent. Many feared the film would reignite the same sorts of emotions early passion plays had. <br />   I'm not sure if I feel qualified to judge the film on the grounds of whether there were undercurrents of antisemitism in its images and portrayals. Others also stated how the film was a sort of sadomasochistic torture fantasy revealing more about the demons in Mel Gibson's mind than any insights into Christ's sacrifice.  <br />   While these were all valid criticisms, not many of the mainstream reviewers seemed to really critically focus on the theology of what the film was centered around. This, for me, was where the real problem with the film lie; in the theology it was celebrating. <br />   At the heart of traditional and popular Christian belief, is the idea that Jesus came into this world with the purpose of living a sinless life so he could offer himself up as perfect sacrifice for everyone's sins. As popular and as accepted as this theology is, it is warranted a closer inspection. <br />   It basically suggests that God, in order to forgive us and restore us to Paradise after our \\"fall from grace\\" as it were, needed a perfect sacrifice as we could not hope to make such an offering on our own. This blood offering was needed or we would all be under God's impending wrath. Culturally, this may have made sense over 2000 years ago, but does it do so now? <br />   As Darwin's theory of evolution shows, we were never perfect to begin with, we're not finished, to paraphrase Bishop John Shelby Spong. This is probably partially why the theory is such a threat to so many fundamentalist believers, as it implies that we didn't need a \\"saviour\\" to restore us to grace. Though, I should point out that many feel evolution and traditional Christian theology surrounding the atonement are compatible, I have never fully understood it. <br />   It paints God as an angry and cruel parent wanting the blood sacrifice of his own son in order to spare us his wrath. As one writer notes, its almost as if Jesus dies to save us, not from sin, but from his own Father. Seen through that lens, one gets the sense that this image of God is more bloodthirsty than loving. <br />   However, the film is a no holds barred portrayal of that form of atonement in action. Before Jesus is scourged, he lets his Father know his \\"heart is ready\\" for what will happen. Therefore, while being whipped (endlessly) I almost felt that the scourgers were mere pawns as God himself was directing this abuse towards his own son.  <br />   Many feel a sense of love when contemplating this view of Jesus' death and thus will not like the view I have taken. That's fine. I simply feel the view I have shared was not expressed by critics enough, and felt a need to share it myself.  <br />   The film itself is gorgeous to look at with great cinematography and a moving score. The actors all handle their dialogue and characters effortlessly, which must have been difficult speaking in another language.  <br />   But, the film's emphasis on gore and showing it \\"how it was\\" really numb the senses. Its hard to focus on much else when all one sees is whips striking Christ's back over and over again.  <br />   In the end, I left the theater asking, why would an almighty and all powerful God, with powers and abilities beyond our comprehension choose the most violent means by which to transact grace and forgiveness. This strict absolutist image of God only puts him in a corner and a narrow one at that. <br />

Have been blasting in my car stereo ever since. There's some really good tracks at the moment it's repeat on Get your number! What a hot track! Good on you Mariah!  I'm getting sick of some of the wannabe divaz out today so it's good to hear a familiar voice again. <br />I definitely recommend this album!!
B00005JNEW|5.0|Most sports fans claim to follow sports because it gives them an escape from the hum-drum routines of daily life.  \\"Friday Night Lights\\" tears that cliche to shreds as it proves that to too many people - both the athletes and the fans who adore them -- sports are the primary focus of daily life. <br /> <br />Simultaneously obeying and transcending the traditions of the football movie, Peter Berg's \\"Friday Night Lights\\" follows the Permian High School football team through its 1988 season. (\\"FNL\\" is a slightly fictionalized version of the best-selling non-fiction book by Buzz Bissinger -- and the deviations are relatively minor.)  Odessa, a busted oil town in the sun-blasted plains of west Texas, has nothing going for it except high school football.  Thanks to the complete absence of opportunity in Odessa, the town is full of dreamers -- the kids who dream of a better life outside of Odessa, and the adults who dream of the kids' winning a state championship. <br /> <br />Indeed, the town is singularly focused on winning the 5-A Texas state title.  The high school football coach (played with excellent reserve by Billy Bob Thornton, the only \\"star\\" in the movie) is the highest-paid employee in the school district.  The football stadium is, by far, the most expensive building in town, holding 20,000 people (every business in town closes during games).  And the players are gods, with high school girls literally falling at their feet. <br /> <br />Several sub-plots involving specific players captivate the audience during the march to the state title (which commences with brutal two-a-day practices in the 110-degree August sunshine).  Two of the most riveting sub-plots involve Boobie Miles and Don Billingsley.  Boobie, the star running back with dreams of the NFL, may be the best player in the state and the history of the high school, but thanks to a cruel twist of fate has to come to terms with the fact that his destiny is more likely entwined with riding the back of a garbage truck than playing on TV on Sundays.  Don Billingsley has to confront his own athletic limitations -- he's never going to get a Division I scholarship -- as well as his drunken, violent father (played surprisingly well by country singer Tim McGraw).  There are other excellent stories told by this movie, as well. <br /> <br />The football action scenes are shot very well -- these are real collisions rather than CGI special effects -- and at all times we believe we're watching the actors play football rather than stuntmen, even for the most brutal tackles and blocks.   <br /> <br />\\"FNL\\" does not limit itself to the perils of sports.  Look for some surprising moments of redemption as the squad moves closer and closer to its Holy Grail, the state championship -- I lost count of how many times the players and coaches were exhorted to \\"win state\\" by the townsfolk . . . and sometimes with more threat than encouragement.  <br /> <br />By casting a bunch of virtual no-name actors, \\"FNL\\" creates a sense of realism that makes the stories that much more powerful.  The young actors' lack of a pedigree does not diminish the truth contained in their performances -- like \\"City of God,\\" \\"Friday Night Lights\\" proves that young, talented actors can be plucked out of thin air and work magic on the screen.   <br /> <br />The best sports movies, including \\"Hoosiers,\\" \\"Bull Durham,\\" and \\"The Bad News Bears,\\" contain wisdom that cannot be found in other tales because sports, like it or not, dominate the American lifestyle.  \\"FNL\\" reminds us of the extent of this domination, both the bitter and the sweet, and that our devotion to sports comes at a price while paying some dividends as well.  A must-see for the high school athlete and the parents of the high school athlete.    <br /> <br />

B0002IVN9W|5.0|The Arcade Fire consists of husband Win Butler and wife R&eacute;gine Chassagne. They pack emotion into this album including such incidents as Chassagne's grandmother passing away in June of 2003, Butler's grandfather in March of 2004, and bandmate Richard Parry's aunt the following month. This album portrays the pain and suffering one goes through when struggling to go on with the death of a loved on.<br /><br />\\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\" In this song, Butler introduced the neighborhood where he grew up with many problems. A young man's parents weep in the room next to him, and he wants to get away to the town square to go meet his girlfriend. They plan an adult future that they think they understand, but in reality, is incomprehensible.<br /><br />\\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\" is about a young individual who struggles through a sense of suicidal desperation. The albums centerpiece, \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" is about Butler's poignant assertion of exasperation and his emotional call to arms. \\"I went out into the night/ I went out to pick a fight with anyone\\"<br /><br />This album is just incredible and among the best ever produced. If this review is interesting at the least bit, then i highly recommend you to purchase this album. And when you do, study the lyrics and when you listen the emotion will squeeze inside of you as if you wrote the album yourself. It is a masterpiece, and every music lover should stumble upon it.

B000001ELD|4.0|In 1978, at the height of KISS's popularity, rather than release a new studio album, all four members simultaneously released a solo album. Although critics have often called this nothing more than a gimmick, there is no denying the quality of these recordings. All four albums are well written and crafted. All four members of KISS really put their heart and soul into this project and made a solo album that really reflects their personality.  KISS was like a stew, made up of four separate ingredients. The KISS solo albums of 1978 really let you see each member and what it is exactly they brought into KISS.<br /><br />The Gene Simmons album is probably the most musically surprising and diverse of the four. By looking at the album cover, of Gene with the demon makeup, with blood dripping down the mouth, you might expect to hear a no-holds-bar heavy metal album. But if that what you are looking for, you'd be better off listening to the Ace Frehley album. The Gene Simmons album is really a grab-bag of styles and makes for a very interesting listen. Despite the eclectic nature of the album, everything works and it's a great collection of songs, except for the unwise inclusion of \\"When you wish Upon a Star.\\"<br /><br />This album is surprisingly mid-paced. The rockers on this album, \\"Radioactive,\\" \\"Burning Up With Fever,\\" \\"Tunnel of Love,\\" \\"True Confessions\\" \\"Living In Sin,\\" are all somewhat tepid, but still interesting. There is also a surprising amount of a Beatles influence on the Gene Simmons album. \\"See You Tonight,\\" \\"Always Near You/Nowhere to Hide,\\" \\"Man of 1,000 Faces,\\" and \\"Mr. Make Believe\\" sees Simmons either playing homage to the Beatles (like in See You Tonight) or at least has an element of the Fab Four. \\"See You in Your Dreams\\" is really the album's only fast-and-heavy rocker. The female backup singers in that song are a nice touch. My only real complaint is the album closes with \\"When You Wish Upon a Star.\\" It's a pretty corny song to begin with and doesn't really fit the mood or vibe of the album. But despite its inclusion, it doesn't end the album on a sour note.<br /><br />All, in all, this is a good, solid collection of songs and shows the creative/Beatles side of Simmons.e mood or vibe of the album.

0060977493|5.0|Orangelemon drinks, rivers holding lifelong stories, beautiful metaphors, and a whole lot of creativity, are all molded together to form this story written so well by Arundhati Roy. Throughout this account of the lives of Esthappen and Rachel we see their struggles through life and their journeys in India.  These twins are spiritually connected in so many ways, and they experience the loss of loved ones, a variety of discoveries, and encounter family situations and experiences that consistently throw small conflicts into this intricate story. Estha and Rachel grow up surrounded by their mother, aunt, cousin and her parents, all of whom are memorable characters. This book does a beautiful job of displaying some factual aspects of India's culture when we see some of its effects on the characters in the story. We see this all in combination with the fictitious childhood and adult stories of the characters that allow us to connect them to our own experiences with growing up, the death of loved ones, and fighting against greater forces.  <br /> <br /> At a glance this book poses a confusing plot and tangled mess of pasts and histories that explain the lives displayed in this story. Roy's unique style of writing and her freedom with words puts up a challenge for the reader as well as a lovely escape from the ordinary. I thoroughly enjoyed this read, and the images my mind created in response to the words on the pages. I would recommend this book to more mature readers with a true appreciation for creative writing. The intriguing storyline, characters, and true talent of the author definitely earned this book it's win of the Booker Prize in 1997. So the next time you're looking to get away and get wrapped up in the life of someone you'll never meet, this exotic novel is a definite must read.

The KISS solo albums of 1978 really let you see each member and what it is exactly they brought into KISS.<br /><br />Ace Frehley's solo album has been universally hailed as the best of the four KISS solo albums.  It is also the best selling of the four. Although it's always been highly regarded among classic rock fans, it is pretty much the only album of the four that has received any kind of appreciation from music critics. The songs Frehley wrote for his album are easily up-to-par with the best of the material he wrote for KISS.  Frehley's voice may not be as smooth or as powerful as Stanley's, and is a little rough-around-the edges, but it fits the songs perfectly.<br /><br />Ace Frehley's album is the heaviest of the four albums. The album starts off strong with the no-holds-bar \\"Rip it Out\\" and never looses momentum. Each song is fast and heavy, with a good infectious hook and at least one killer solo. It's difficult to pick out a highlight, because really the entire album is terrific. But if I had to pick a highlight, I'd go with the ferocious \\"Rip it Out, the spacey \\"I'm in Need of Love\\" or the catchy \\"New York Groove.\\" But there really isn't any filler, it's just a great rock n' roll album.<br /><br />Ace Frehley's album is easily just as good as anything KISS has ever released. It's a classic and one of the best rock albums of the 1970s.
0743454529|3.0|In college I was a philosophy major, moral and ethic philosophy being what I focused on.  I was naturally drawn to the subject of this novel and for 95% of the book, the author really held me, with her multiple points of view and how the personal conflicts of the all the characters play out. <br /> <br />And then - as other reviews here have stated - she cops out at the end.  Did the author feel that a surprise would intrigue the reader?  Perhaps, but I know I didnt think so.  I was so annoyed that as it happened I found myself yelling \\"you must be kidding!\\" out loud.  I felt, as the reader, that I had been cheated of the ending I was being prepared for. <br /> <br />After I was finished - and still annoyed - I found myself going back to the beginning of the book.  It was there I found something in the Prolouge that suggested that this was not a surprise for the author (unless she added the prologue later).  For the epilogue and the prologue are a set (note the font).   <br /> <br />I also want to add that while the way the characters interact is completely believable and filled with depth.  The way their own thoughts read is too poetic, too \\"deep\\" at times for me, making me aware of the author, not the character.  <br /> <br />Overall good, but some flaws that seemed quite glaring.

B0007GAERG|4.0|This album sounds far better than her last two albums.  Mariah Carey sounds better with new producers the Neptunes, Kanye West, Scram Jones and others as well as longtime producer Jermaine Dupri. I love It's Like That, To the Floor, and the one she sings with Jermaine that samples the Illusion song from 1982. The ballads are nice and have a live feel here.  The voice is still here, as Mariah still sings with strong range. One of the few to still hit those high notes 15 years later!  Though competition from other female singers like Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Ciara, and others have affected Mariah, this album has the chance to bring the attention back to her! There's a lot of potential hits here.  I don't skip the CD on songs like I did with Charmbracelet. This is consistent all the way through! And she sounds like she's having fun on the songs.
B0007PALSE|1.0|Fox is ridiculous. They're doing this with three films I know of: The Day After Tomorrow, Man on Fire and I, Robot. The problem is, of course, that these films were all very, very recently released on DVD for the first time. If they were truly interested in the interests of the Consumer, they would have released the two-disc editions the first time around - not one or two months later. <br /> <br />The second problem with all this is that the \\"new\\" special features really aren't worth an upgrade. I don't see anything new on \\"I, Robot\\" save a movie ticket to see \\"The Fantastic Four\\" and an extra documentary. (By the way, the European release had all of these extras already - except the movie ticket - because they were kind enough to release a one-disc rental copy and a two-disc special edition SIMULTANEOUSLY.) <br /> <br />I'm not a huge contender of special edition re-releases. I've shelled out the cash for them before, and in many cases I love when films (such as the upcoming Casino, Stripes, etc.) are re-released with new special features that weren't available on the original DVDs. (Because most of the time they were released at the turn of the '90s when DVDs were fairly new and not known for their expansive features.) <br /> <br />However, to release special edition DVDs of films that have just been released on DVD to begin with is a real crime in my opinion. I'll probably buy \\"Man on Fire\\" but I will not buy \\"I, Robot\\" or \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" - or, for that matter, Focus Features' re-release of \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" (which only contains four extra features, all of which are supposedly very poor.) <br /> <br />These companies need to wise up. <br /> <br />As far as the film \\"I, Robot\\" goes - it's better than I thought it would be. A pretty good brainless action blockbuster, good fun, nothing more. <br /> <br />Not worth spending over $40 on once you own both DVDs, though.
0767803434|4.0|One of Harrison Ford's better and least appreciated performances, Air Force One is a thrilling film that makes the most of its action hero star and his unique bond with movie going audiences. In Air Force One, Ford plays the role of President of the United States. In the same way that it's near impossible to envision any other actor in the role of Indiana Jones, it's difficult to envision anyone else as president for this film. Ford projects the image of such a strong, honorable, and likeable leader that the audience is immediately rooting for him.  <br /> <br />Originally released in 1997, Ford plays President James Marshall, a Vietnam vet turned president who makes it clear in a stunning speech at a Moscow dinner that America will now pursue a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy on international terrorism (sound familiar?). Boarding Air Force One for the return flight home from Moscow, Marshall is joined by his wife Grace (Wendy Crewson) and his daughter Alice (Liesel Matthews). He's also joined by a contingent of Eastern European journalists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman). <br /> <br />Unbeknownst to the President and his fellow Air Force One passengers, the group of men aren't journalists at all, but instead an elite team of terrorists bent on taking the president hostage. With a Secret Service agent (Xander Berkeley) collaborating with the terrorists, Korshunov has intimate inside knowledge of the procedures and safeguards deployed to protect the president on Air Force One. When Secret Agent Gibbs (Berkeley) opens the onboard weapons cache of Air Force One, his terrorist friends carry out a methodic plan to eliminate the president's security circle. <br /> <br />At the sound of gunfire, President Marshall is hurriedly raced below deck to an escape pod so as to avoid his capture. With the pod jettisoned, Korshunov is enraged that the original plan failed. But his original goal remains intact, and the terrorist decides that the president's family and the remaining passengers will make do as hostages. Negotiating with the acting Vice President (Glenn Close) in the President's absence, Korshunov demands the release of General Ivan Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a communist hardliner who Korshunov believes will bring back the Soviet Union and restore the intoxicating glory of its empire years. With a well laid and executed plan, Korshunov's demands are met and arrangements are made to release General Radek. But what Korshunov doesn't know is that President Marshall is still onboard, having jettisoned an empty escape pod, and he's intent on freeing his family and kicking the terrorists off his plane... <br /> <br />Filled with action and some memorable one-liners, Air Force One is a classic Harrison Ford action thriller along the lines of Patriot Games and Clear And Present Danger. In addition, prior to filming Air Force One, the producers were given unprecedented access to the real thing. The result is a film that displays the inner sanctums of Air Force One with stunning accuracy, providing the audience with a glimpse into the actual traveling life of the most powerful man in the world. Overall, this a must-see movie that you won't want to miss... <br /> <br />The DVD Report

B0001I561E|5.0|Anxious to follow up on the massive commercial and critical success of Beauty And The Beast, Disney created another animated masterpiece with Aladdin. Although not nearly as successful (in terms of critical acclaim) as the aforementioned film or later Disney creations, The Lion King and Finding Nemo, Aladdin is nevertheless just as entertaining and probably the funniest of all the animated Disney features. With the voice of Robin Williams leading the way, the film is a non-stop foray into the fantasy world of A Thousand And One Arabian Nights spliced together with the rapier-like wit and quick-fire humor of one of America's most talented performers... <br /> <br />The film takes place hundreds of years ago in the windswept sands of the kingdom of Agrabah, where a young street urchin named Aladdin spends his days wandering the streets, stealing and hustling for survival, with his loyal companion Abu - a clever and enterprising monkey. Yet, in stark contrast to the poverty in the streets below, the brilliant facades of a massive palace tower high above the background of Aladdin's life. Inside, the Sultan of Agrabah lives a life of luxury with his beautiful daughter, Jasmine, and a cunning, evil adviser named Jafar. <br /> <br />Forced to spend her days inside the palace walls (against her wishes), the headstrong Princess Jasmine sneaks out in order to experience life on the outside. While scouring the dangerous streets of her kingdom, the girl befriends Aladdin who is immediately awestruck by her beauty. But when Princess Jasmine's escape becomes known to Jafar and her father, she is quickly rounded up, and Aladdin is put in prison. Hoping to seize the kingdom for himself, Jafar enlists the aid of Aladdin in an effort to obtain a fabled magic lamp, the purported powers of which are unlimited. Because legend has it that only a \\"diamond in the rough\\" is capable of retrieving the lamp from the Cave of Wonders... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
0783219695|5.0|I will always remember those tense three days in April 1970 when the Apollo 13 astronauts seemed suspended in space, and this was well before the days of 24-hour coverage by CNN and Fox. For those who have yet to purchase this movie on DVD, the tenth anniversary two-disc set is a must-have for any adventure film-lover, especially for those like myself who were obsessed with the nation's space program in the 1960's and early 70's. Ron Howard, the director, came of age with this thrilling recreation of the aborted Apollo 13 mission, as defining a moment in NASA's history as the tragic Challenger explosion. The 1995 movie was a faithful depiction of what went wrong with the flight and how the mission changed dramatically to one of saving the three astronauts from being marooned in space forever. One would think that knowing the ending would rob the viewer of the suspense factor, but Howard does an amazing job in making the story feel fresh by guiding us through the heroic acts both in the capsule and at NASA's Mission Control in vividly realistic detail. He also evokes the atmosphere back then with emotional and visual accuracy, showing how anti-climactic the mission was perceived in light of Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon just the year prior. A rupture in the oxygen tank changed things completely as the movie illustrates a desperate attempt at survival with computer systems turned off, the capsule moving toward freezing temperatures and the three men relying on their gut instincts to maneuver the capsule home.<br /><br />What I appreciate most about the movie is that Howard does not derail the basic story with unnecessary subplots or flourishes of melodrama. He realizes the real story is more than enough to engage the viewer and that the attention to detail, often technical in nature, is not off-putting.  Howard even creates blood-pumping suspense out of the ground effort to jerry-build a scrubber to clean carbon dioxide from the capsule's air supply.  This kind of film is all in the details, even the more predictable home scenes where family members try to confront their increasing sense of fear. The movie has a solid testosterone-heavy cast - Tom Hanks stalwart as always as Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell; Bill Paxton as Fred Haise; Kevin Bacon as last-minute substitute Jack Swigert; Ed Harris as determined flight director Gene Kranz; Gary Sinise as grounded astronaut Ken Mattingly; and bravely leading the homefront is Kathleen Quinlan as Lovell's wife, Marilyn. Even though the move is full of familiar suspense elements and the characters' interactions are often just officious, there is hardly a wasted dramatic moment in the entire film, pretty impressive given its 140-minute running time. This is a superbly done real-life adventure film and docudrama and aside from Philip Kaufman's 1983 adaptation of Tom Wolfe's \\"The Right Stuff\\", probably the best movie about the space program.<br /><br />The smoothly edited, 116-minute IMAX version (produced in 2002) is on the second disc, and the widescreen orientation coupled with the enhanced sound makes for great viewing as well. There are three documentaries included spread across both discs: the comprehensive making-of feature, \\"Lost Moon: The Triumph of Apollo 13 - The Making of Apollo 13\\", which has interviews with Howard and the cast, as well as insight into how the space shots were created; \\"Conquering Space: The Moon and Beyond\\", a 48-minute general overview of the race to the Moon and the exploration of Mars, produced mainly for the uninitiated; and a twelve-minute NBC Dateline feature called \\"Lucky 13: The Astronauts' Story\\", which contains interviews with the astronauts and members of Mission Control for the Apollo 13 mission. There are two alternative commentary tracks, the first with Howard who is extremely knowledgeable and highly infectious in his descriptions of the shoot, the other with Jim and Marilyn Lovell providing valuable insight as to how it really felt as the events were unfolding. A truly excellent package.e unfolding. A truly excellent package.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|D12 is a fun band to listen to, they're not trying to be legitimate hip hop pioneers and they're making the best of their time on the spotlight. And for the most part the songs here are ranging from mediocre to good. Let's start with the good. 'how come' has the members reflecting on losses of friendships and eminem drops his best verse since about a year. 'my band' is the first single and it's love it or not, I think it's catchy. 'loyalty' is good featuring a cameo by Obie Trice. 'good die young' is a highlight, as well as 'commercial break' and 'bugz 97,' (though the beat needs to be worked on). <br /> <br />The low lights: 'get my gun' is plain pointless, and the lyrics don't work with the bouncy beat-they have an overdose of skits, and most of them aren't even funny, with 'bizarre' being the only exception. 'git up' has marshall violently explaining a night in the club over the tune of the name game. those two shouldn't go together. and 'u r the one' is a rehash of 'i'll be damned' <br /> <br />Still a decent purchase. but how did it take three years to come up with this? <br /> <br />here's hoping (eminem's lyricism will improve) <br />snikdawg

0316172324|3.0|I enjoyed the book and found it to be well written overall, though there was a bit too much handholding at times.  I will certainly never be able to look at margarine or tall men the same way again and my interest in investigating human facial expressions has been irreversibly piqued.   <br /> <br />Given his discussion, both in the book and in interviews, of being mistaken for a criminal -- a rapist, and on 14th Street -- I can't help but think that Gladwell should have drawn a larger parallel between his own situation and that of Amadou Diallo (who worked on 14th street and was mistaken for a rapist).  He instead opted, perhaps with a nudge from an editor or his mother, to look at that parallel through a very broad lens and wrote Blink when a different book should have emerged.   <br /> <br />That being said, Gladwell is to be applauded for providing in chapter 6 the most sober, intelligent and considerate explanation I've read for what happened to Mr. Diallo on that fateful night in the Bronx.  In this final chapter, he brilliantly gives us an all-too-salient real world example which illustrates so many of the elements that he describes throughout the book.
B000003CMB|5.0|the allman brothers band have always been the best southern rock band, and the least political of those groups.  They had a resident guitar god in Duane Allman, who is also famous for being a session musician, and they were famous for their southern style jams on live albums like this one, which is universally considered their best album overall.  terrific guitar work and licks abound, the band pulling off one of the best live sets ever recorded in rock music.  If you are a fan of live music or rock in general, you have to have this.  If you like southern rock you already do; if you don't you can't possibly be a real fan yet (Lynyrd Skynyrd, while good, aren't as classy or classic a band as the Allman's.  You should get both in your collection).  Also get Eat A Peach, their best studio album overall.

B000002NJS|5.0|I had heard the poppy and peppy stuff that Madonna made in the 80's and I didn't like it, but I must admit that this album is really cool and basically a 180 degree turn of sorts.  That she was able to bring in album concept like this and make it her best one yet says something of her talent.  I do agree that there is some kind of weird mysto-self-centered aspect to the songs on here, but the songs are unique and more interesting then most people her age can come up with.  I was especially intrigued by the electronica that dominates the whole album, quite a change.  This album is all about changing, growing up in a way.  It doesn't work all the time (\\"candy perfume girl\\" always annoyed me) but there are very strong aspects to all of the songs.  This cd is definitely worth your time.  Go get it!

She's had her bad times, but at the end of the day, Mariah is a genuine DIVA. This album assures us of just that. No one will ever replace Mariah Carey or take her place in the spotlight. This album gives us new material for her. Mariah has not forgotten roots in ballads and shows us with the ones on here. People like to say that when she does hip-hop influenced songs that she is selling out. Well, if Mariah wants to sell records, she has to keep up with the times. The songs aren't bad, either. My rundown: <br /> <br />IT'S LIKE THAT: The lead-off single and a good choice for one. Sets the tone for the whole cd. I like the beat. 10/10 <br /> <br />WE BELONG TOGETHER: I think this is her next single and it a good one. This is my second favorite song on the entire cd. It is beautiful and a ballad with a beat. Great vocal production. 20/10 <br /> <br />SHAKE IT OFF: This is a hip-hop influenced song and it works well with her voice. It is my favorite song on the cd. The beat is great and everything about it is great. 20/10 <br /> <br />MINE AGAIN: Another ballad. It isn't one of my favorites, but is showcases that wonderful instrument Mariah calls her voice. 7/10 <br /> <br />SAY SOMETHIN' F/SNOOP DOGG: A song produced by the Neptunes. You can hear Pharrell's voice in it. Snoop's verse is great and he is a great addition to the song. 9/10 <br /> <br />STAY THE NIGHT: Has an old school flavor to it. Very nice, laid back song. Her voice is beautiful on it. 8/10 <br /> <br />GET YOUR NUMBER F/JERMAINE DUPRI: Not one of my favorites. In my opinion, the worst track on the album mainly because JD does the chorus and it is annoying. 5/10 <br /> <br />ONE AND ONLY F/TWISTA: A mid-tempo hip-hop song. Twista adds his bit and it goes well with it. They compliment each other very well in it. 9/10 <br /> <br />CIRCLES: Throwback Mariah right here. Allof those who loved her back-in-the-day ballads will love this one. One of my favorites. 10/10 <br /> <br />YOUR GIRL: A nice song about wanting to get with a guy. It seems a little short for such a great song. 10/10 <br /> <br />I WISH I KNEW: I like the concert feel to this song. Mariah speaks on it and my sister thought it was Alicia Keys talking. I had to remind her that most singers that sing high have rather deep voices. A beautiful song that will sound great if she sings it live. 10/10 <br /> <br />TO THE FLOOR F/NELLY: I really hate it when rappers sing, but Nelly amazes me when he does it sometimes (ex. Over and Over). He and Mariah make beautiful music. A club song and is very fun to just dance around to. 10/10 <br /> <br />JOY RIDE: This song is beautiful. I love it. Bordering on ballad. The piano is beautiful and Mariah's voice never fails to amaze. It reminds me of a song off her Butterfly album called CLOSE MY EYES. That is the most beautiful song I've ever heard her sing before. 20/10 <br /> <br />FLY LIKE A BIRD: Mariah always seems to have a gospel like song on her albums and this is it for TEOM. A song about her emancipation. It is great. 10/10 <br /> <br />This album is great for all Mariah fans, new and old. I promise you will not be disappointed when you hear this album. It is her best since Daydream in my opinion. Please add this great album to your collection. It really lives up to the hype and its title.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|...that's the thrill of this album! From the ashes of At the Drive-In, one of the most relevant and important punk bands of the last 20 years arises the three-headed hybrid Frankenbeast of Mars Volta. If you thought \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\" was out-there, it is Backstreet Boys next to \\"Frances the Mute\\". You can sit back, stroke your wispy chin hairs and ponder if mad geniuses Omar and Cedric put this album together to throw a humongous middle-finger to the mainstream; essentially throw a chemical dirty bomb into a marketplace full of media (...) and squeaky-clean rockers. Let's say this album looked so incredibly out of place at number 5 on the Billboard charts in its first week. And of course it fell about fifteen places the week after...  I've been listening to this album for two solid months now and there are still not enough words to properly describe the album's journey. Let's just say if you don't have 77 minutes to devote exclusively to this album, you will hate it. Even if you have 77 minutes, you might still hate it. You can assume that the Mars Volta made an album so impenetrable that only the most intrepid souls would make the trip, and you would probably be right. But let's just say this: in this musical atmosphere, full of \\"singers\\" hawking their marginal talents (I'm looking at your daughters, Joe), and rock bands continually watering down Nirvana's borrowed sounds decades after the fact, it is a breath of fresh air to see a band take enormous risks with their music with absolutely no regard for how many copies it might sell. Right now, these guys are one of the best bands in the world, and that's no lie. Even better live! Viva la Volta!
B000777J2S|5.0|this has to be one of the most beautiful and searing albums i've ever heard.  I'm a fan of 'unusual' voices and artists, and Antony's vibratto, though yes a bit suspect at first, won me over within seconds.  The vocal comparison to Nina Simone is fitting.  Not very many artists get compared to one of the world's greats.  The lyrics are dark yet inspiring at once, and you can feel the weight of Antony's words in his voice and delivery.  Fantastic from start to finish, but be warned...this album is not for the faint of heart, or emotionally unstable.  It may send you over the edge.  It had me shedding tears within minutes.  I Am a Bird Now is truly a stupendous work of resonating genius.
038533348X|5.0|This book is one of those rare gems that you stumble across by accident and end up loving for your entire life! I was 14 when I first read this and now its practically an annual event.<br /><br />I love the standard Vonngeut canon (which is, in order of \\"must read\\"ness: Slaughter House 5, Breakfast of Champions and Bluebeard), but none of those titles had quite the effect on me that Cats Cradle did. I won't spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that this apocolyptic satire of religion and science; predestination and free will; ice and ice 9; is brilliant throughout. There's a reason that this book holds cult status with Vonnegut fans around the world; read it, you'll get it!<br /><br />Reading the rest of the Vonnegut catalogue now just crushes me, because nothing lives up to his big three titles. It was as though he spent himself on his masterpiece and then there was nothing left. Nothing except this one diamond in the rough.<br /><br />All I want to know is: who are the reviewers giving this book less than 5 stars?? I just hope that you didn't put your real addresses on your wishlists....
B00000AFWW|5.0|again, hole has made me aw at their talent and musical ability. i love this cd. i dont know which of their cd's i like the best because they are each good in thier own way.<BR>this cd is more soft then the others but it is still great.
0517548232|5.0|Economics in One Lesson is an older book of economic lessons that build on each other, one after the other.  The presentation, that is, the style of the writing and the pace of the book reveals its age.  This is, however, not a bad thing per se. <br /> <br />The construction of the lessons is great.  They move at a great pace, and expose the key concepts of economics clearly. <br /> <br />I do recognize that some of the reviewers take issue with its advocacy of laissez-faire capitalism and its criticism of government intervention, but that is a valid point of view in economic theory, and Mr. Hazlitt espouses it well. <br /> <br />I really like this book, and I think you will too.  Get it.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey has laid out a new path and vision for herself with \\"The Emancipation of Mimi.\\" This is her most reassured and confident work in years. She puts probably her best song to date on \\"Mimi,\\" \\"We Belong Together.\\" Words can't really describe how exquisite this song is. One of her most flawless vocal performances. But it doesn't end there. \\"Mimi\\" has something for everyone: R&B, Hip-Hop, Pop. If you're a Mariah fan or a new one, I wouldn't hesitate to pick \\"Mimi\\" up before they're all gone.
B00023B1LC|5.0|This is a great action movie - it has a plot, a point and a human element that adds to the drama. The chemistry between Matt Damon and Franka Potente is amazing, and who knew sweet little Matt could kick ass AND be a romantic lead?! The action is exciting without being full of gore, and you actually care about how things turn out for Jason Bourne, who seems to be a good guy in a bad situation. The dialogue and the plot are entirely realistic despite the somewhat exotic idea of a trained assassin with amnesia.
B000002NHN|5.0|The entire \\"Book of Secrets\\" by Loreena McKennitt is wonderful, but my favorite on the album is the Mummer's Dance. It was this single song which caused me to seek out her music, and to purchase both this album and \\"The Mask and the Mirror.\\" If you like Enya, you'll love Loreena.
B00000K19E|5.0|as far as action movies or sci-fi movies go. Tons of comic book-style violence, but it's engaging enough to pull you into the story. Keanu is perfect in this part - his personal quirks fit the character of Neo so well you'd think the part was written around him, Carrie Ann Moss kicks ass, as does the rest of the cast. My advice is to see this movie then stop - don't see the other two. The end of this one is perfect, and the other two just wasted the potential that this one created.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is just an incredible great album. I am glad i bought this album and i'm lovin it. <br />I was never a fan but the song \\"it's like that\\" got me thinking..which i can prettie much relate to. <br />I greatly recommend this album and please look for the following tracks when you do. <br />*GET YOUR NUMBER(THE TRACK I REPEAT MOST EVERYTIME) <br />*TO THE FLOOR <br />*STAY THE NIGHT <br />*FLY LIKE A BIRD <br />*WE BELONG TOGETHER
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I warned you. Don't see this movie - it ruins the whole concept. Instead of being the great liberator, it turns out Neo was nothing but a software upgrade. All the same violence, all the same villain, all for nothing but a sunset. Ugh. What a rip off.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|This is a strongly evocative film.  Closer is an adult themed movie with strong language, superb writing and achingly beautiful acting by Jude Law, Clive Owens, Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts.    The movie moves seamlessly, touching the beginings and endings of the duplicitous and self-serving relationships that entangle the four main characters.  The roots of the movie are the deep scars the characters take into their relationships, using themselves and their partners in very contemporary deceitful, duplicitous and self-rationalized ways.  The characters are desperate and deft and truthful and dangerous.      A movie that is not for the faint, but is truly rewarding.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Matt Damon is back with a vengence in this very dark - literally and metaphorically - sequel to The Bourne Identity. (See it first, so this one will make sense to you.) While the first had a love story interwoven with the action, this one is pure chase scenes and shootings. There are LONNNG stretches of time where there is no dialogue at all - just music and car crashes, with maybe a line or two of Russian (with subtitles) here and there. There's a nice, surprisingly tender end to the journey, then they leave an option for a sequel. Keep your fingers crossed - this could be a nice little franchise - like Bond only better, because there's no attitude and Bourne has an actual conscience.
0446310786|5.0|Most of the people who gave this book one star said they were being forced to read it for some sort of school assignment. Perhaps they couldn't enjoy the book just because it was given as an assignment. Then again, maybe they just didn't like it.  <br /> <br />I think To Kill a Mockingbird is an excellent book. It is easy to read without being boring and I enjoyed all of it. And yes, I too am reading this for a school assignment, and in my opinion it is one of the best books I've ever read in school. My friends also agree. I highly recommend To Kill a Mockingbird.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|on the promise of The Matrix. Whereas the first movie was as good as it gets, this one was a disappointment. The whole industrial-primitive society they developed was so far from anything the first movie even hinted at that it didn't work at all. They tried to work more sex into this one, but it was forced, and the story went nowhere. They should have stopped with one movie.
B000000183|5.0|Though, in my opinion, this is not Sonny's greatest recording, it is perhaps his most influencial and definatly his greatest herald, listed often as one of the 10 greatest albums of jazz. I've read some reviews claiming that other sax players far surpass Sonny's skill, names like Stan Getz and Trane. However, once you listen to this album you'll see why Sonny is called by almost all music critics as the greatest improviser on any instrument in any style of all time, he was actually voted almost unanimously to this title by Down Beat, Jazziz, and Jazz Times in the 90s, as well as perhaps jazz's greatest virtuoso. Not simply for his raw technical ability or immense understanding of harmony and melody, but his flawless ability to make even the most dense and esoteric music seem ever so familiar and listenable in any context. Blue 7 is a monumental example of Sonny's skill, many people don't know that the 'melody' is completly improvised, and though it may not seem, it is a forward look at just how far Sonny will play outside the changes. This is a great starting point for those who want to here the master of melodic improvisation and I highly recommend listening to The Bridge and On Impulse after this record as well.
B0000399WI|5.0|Shawshank redemption tells the story of a man who is wrongfully accused of the murder of his wife after he catches her cheating with another man. It is based on a short story: \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\" written by Stephen King.<br /><br />Right from the beginning you can feel the injustice done to Andy Dufrense (played expertly by Tim Robbins)and find yourself rooting for him. Morgan Freeman is also very good as Andy Dufrense's  friend  and fellow cell mate \\"Red\\" Redding. Morgan also lends his voice as the movie's narrator. Both actors are at their peak and deliver a great performance in the movie.<br /><br />Set in the dark halls of a fictitious Maine state penitentiary called Shawshank. It is a story about redemption and hope against incredible odds. Andy's character suffers every injustice you can imagine occurs in prisons but never gives into the circumstances and tries to rise above it. You will not be the same after watching this movie. So \\"get busy living\\" and rent this one now.
B000002UA0|4.0|The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn (1967.), Pink Floyd's first studio album<br /><br />'The Piper at the Gates of Dawn', Pink Floyd's first studio album, released in 1967 marked the birth of one of the most influential and experimental bands of all time. Formed in the mid-1960's, getting their band name from musicians Pink Anderson and Floyd Council, Pink Floyd were very much an up and coming innovative band and quickly gained a good underground following. Having achieved pretty good successes with their first two singles ('See Emily Play' and 'Arnold Layne'), Pink Floyd decided to concentrate their efforts thereon purely on album making and so early in 1967 went to the recording studio and cut this impressive debut effort.<br /><br />I don't think I've quite heard an album that is as off the wall as this one - if you're expecting the 70's sound that Pink Floyd had, you will not find it on this album. Pink Floyd are pretty much the wacky, psychedelic band with this album, but it is no way inferior to their later work. This album is also an exception to the other Floyd albums as it is the only one whose songwriting is dominated by Syd Barratt, the original Floyd frontman. Syd Barratt was a one off as a songwriter and musician and for me he was the pioneer of Pink Floyd's greatness as he gave their music the original alternative directions which ultimately put the band in a class of their own. Eventhough he was to be thrown out of the band during the second album (Saucerful of Secrets) recording due to his LSD addiction, his influence on the band lived on - 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' is a document in real terms of just how much a genius he was, even if the music is totally bizarre. This is why, for me, this album is more than just psychedelia - it doesn't just embody the style of the time, it also incorporated sound effects, atmospherics and keyboard styles that other bands had never thought of even trying to add to their music but the Floyd did and it works a treat! 'The Piper at the Gates of Dawn' like many of Pink Floyd's works attracts a lot of criticism from people who don't give the band a chance. Although I would never recommend this to a new listener to Pink Floyd - I will always advise to never pass off this work as incoherant rubbish, as some people have. What this album is about is not catchy, melodic tunes BUT instead is a great piece of experimentation with the aim to make the music thought provoking to the listener. There are many dimensions to the music in Piper (a fact that is true for a lot of Pink Floyd's music) and this makes the album a new experience every time you listen to it.<br /><br />So prepare for something different from the very start. 'Astronomy Domine' opens the album - it has a very futuristic and space style, with some great experimental playing on the guitar from Syd coupled with some blistering effects on the keyboard from Rick Wright. 'Lucifer Sam' is a bit darker in complexion, with lyrics about a siamese cat over plenty of scratches, wails from the guitar and dissonent riffs which are very effective. The whole thing slows down with 'Matilda Mother', Syd sings with his fairytale style lyrics - something which is common in the stuff he penned. 'Flaming', starts with the effects of a train running out of a station - the lyrics on this one are quite babyish and again fairytale like but again it works with the instrumentation. 'PowR TocH' is a great track - with plenty of wierd voice overs from Syd with some jazzy piano playing from Wright - its quite amusing to listen to. 'Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk' is the only Roger Waters effort on the album - a bit of a sing along with some slap dash drumming from Nick Mason but its a fun listen. 'Interstallar Overdrive' is the most experimental piece on the album though, starting off actually quite tunefully, it becomes very wacky - you cant tell it in words. 'The Gnome', 'Chapter 24' and 'Scarecrow' are all solid tracks with more fairy story lyrics from Barratt. 'Bike' closes the album, a final sing along from Barratt on this album were he sings about bikes, mice and gingerbreadmen - all the simple things in life! It rounds off with bells chiming and then the honking of geese!<br /><br />'The Piper at the Gates of Dawn' was very ahead of its time and more importantly was a great debut effort from Pink Floyd even if it is completely bizarre in parts. As a big fan of Pink Floyd, I really enjoy listening to this album, it has grown on me over the times I've listened to it with its unique style. Pink Floyd might have started here but I would certainly not recommend this to any new listener to Pink Floyd. 'Dark Side of the Moon' and 'Wish You Were Here' are the places to start but any fan of the band will love this album and will enjoy journeying into Interstellar Overdrive!s the album, a final sing along from Barratt on this album were he sings about bikes, mice and gingerbreadmen - all the simple things in life!

B0000019PA|5.0|The heart of the Elephant 6 group of bands nay not be around any longer, but the music lives on with this fantastic album. Aeroplane is everything that was right about the Athens, Ga sound in the late 90's. While the underlieing disidence may not be to everone's liking; the influance of this band can be seen in alot of bands begining to gain prominance, not just from the Southeast but all around the world. If you Lke Neutral Milk Hotel also try Olivia Tremor control, Of Motreal, Sunshine Fix, Elf Power, and Count Kellam.
0884271153|1.0|I worked for a high-tech company of around 300 people in 1996.  The president of the company purchased and loved \\"It's Not Luck\\" so much that he required all the people in the company to buy and read it.  At this time, his company was well-financed and very high-profile. <br /> <br />The president implemented Goldratt's recommendations, and the company proceeded to spend the company's money on all the wrong projects.  He overfinanced his pet projects and pushed breadwinners out the door before they were ready to ship.  The company's products sold progressively more poorly, and the company finally declared bankruptcy and went out of business two years ago. <br /> <br />If you're going to read a business book, you should read a business book written by a guy who knows how to do business.  Goldratt is a consultant who's out to sell books, not a guy who's actually done the things he proports to know how to do.  Check out [...] if you think that's not true. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, if you want to know how to run a company, go read \\"My Years with General Motors\\" by Alfred Sloan.  While Sloan's book also involves drawing bubble diagrams, it does not suggest that you can run a company by drawing pictures alone.
B000001ZSE|5.0|This compilation spans across 7 studio albums and 1 live recording made during the period of 1976-1991. Obviously, it's next to impossible to pick a dozen of \\"best of\\" tracks from that much material, so that everyone would agree upon the choice. However, \\"Images\\" does a nearly perfect job of giving a taste of each of Jarre's albums made in the first 15 years of his working, presenting a couple of tracks off each of them. As such, it is a good place to start getting into Jarre's music, and a good compilation to choose which album is worth buying. Jarre's music is normally meant to be listened to for the duration of the whole album. This fact shows these individual pieces' compositional strength, as they stand quite good on their own, being separated from their respective album's concept. <br /> <br />The compilation also includes 3 previously unreleased tracks. Normally I hate such inclusions, because, frankly, they are nothing more than an attractor to force people who already own every studio album to buy the compilation. Also, such tracks are normally sub par to the \\"best of\\" material. But with \\"Images\\" these new pieces don't fall out of context. Especially \\"Globe Trotter\\" is good, with its cautios staccatto synths and a chilling melody. <br /> <br />With its drawbacks, \\"Images\\" is a very good compilation. If you're hesitant where to start with Jean-Michel Jarre, you are advised to buy it.
B0002X314C|5.0|I first to begin to really get into this man called legend when I saw him in concert live opening for the legendary Ms Alicia Keys. I must admit he was phenomenal, I then went to purchase get lifted. From song one all the way to the end this man is a master piece within his own right. It doesn't matter if you like R&B, Hip Hop or Jazz it has it all. This album can speak volumes to anyone it comes in contact with. Some of my favorite tracks are Ordinary People, Live it up, So high and Number one. I can honestly say this is the first CD in a while that I have been able to put in the player and listen to and enjoy from the beginning to the end without hitting the skip button. It is an investment in anyone's music collection.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|I don't have any problem with Jesus being played by Jim Caveziel---those who think that they know what Jesus looked like (light-skinned or dark) are simply indulging in fantasy: no one knows how a Galilean of that period would have appeared. I don't have any problem with someone wanting to tell some version of the Gospel stories with a measure of cultural accuracy: that is an interesting idea, and perhaps timely. I have no problem with the writer adding mythological elements of his own: that is to be expected, and anyway it is in accord with biblical mythology. I see no merit in the claims of anti-Semitism: only the leader of the Sanhedrin is really blamed for Jesus' condemnation, and it is clear that others disagree. There is no uniform antipathy directed towards the Jews in this film.  <br /> <br />And yet I find this film one of the most despicable exercises in sadism that I have ever witnessed. There is not a shred of genuine religious feeling here, just a terrible desire to turn the gospels into a fantasy of cruelty beyond anything that is actually written. Yes, the Romans were capable of great barbarism, but what we see here is beyond all belief. (Strange that no Italians have risen up in protest: they have far more cause to complain than those who are Jewish.) This film is not a testament to a Christian faith, it is a testament to a sickness of soul that, by the tone of many of these laudatory reviews, is now horribly shared. And finally, those who took children to see this film, knowing what it is like, lacked judgment to a degree that I cannot fathom. What were you thinking? I hope it was worth all the nightmares.
0440180295|1.0|Kurt Vonnegut's  SlaughterHouse-Five    Slaughterhouse-Five is about a World War II veteran who is struggling to understand people, time, and what people think of time.  This books protagonist is Billy Pilgrim although Kurt Vonnegut wants the readers to know that he himself is part of the story.    Billy Pilgrim has experienced many difficult and abnormal points in his life during and after the war.  He sees his life as a never ending timeline where he skips back and forth recounting events that made him feel a certain way.  Maybe, Vonnegut wants readers to know the feeling of emptiness and confusion that war veterans face or wants us to see life in a different way, a more happier way. Either that or Vonnegut wrote a really good anti-human/war book.  However, Vonnegut does begin the book with establishing that war on earth is inevitable.     The book starts out as Kurt Vonnegut's own account, he is in 1967 and is visiting the slaughterhouse where he was once held captive by German soldiers during World War II.  He's with a friend also from WWII.  Later, Billy Pilgrim is brought into the story and is said to be \\"unstuck in time\\", meaning Pilgrim has the ability to move from time period to time period.  For now he is in 1968 and has survived a plane crash... I think Vonnegut adds an 'alien' encounter in the story for us to further understand the timeline we live in and are not bound to.  Its always easier to explain how human life is when you look at it from the perspective of 'aliens'.  In the part where Billy Pilgrim is abducted by aliens, the aliens teach him how life is just many accounts of good and bad memories and people should pick out the good parts and enjoy them.  While recuperating from his plane crash, Billy's wife dies.  Billy becomes more and more obsessed with how he sees life differently and he begins to share it via the media.  His adult daughter begins to think that he's going insane.  Billy moves back and forth from when he was captured by German soldiers to post-war with his family.  In his memories of war he remembers himself feeling like 'The Three Musketeers' with his friends- this being an example of Vonnegut showing Billy only remembering the happier time in life.    \\"So it goes\\"... I still have to finish the book even though I don't want to because I can't understand the point nor relate to it.  All books need a point, Vonnegut goes back and forth.  'CHANGE the world' and 'changing the world is POINTLESS'.        This review is in dedication to Mr. C and his fantastical job at teaching.
B000068MFS|5.0|This is a sweet little romantic film that grows on you after the first half hour and has your full attention by the end. Kate Beckinsale is charming as the British girl John Cusack meets by chance at Christmas while shopping. They spend the evening trying to find out if destiny brought them together, only to lose touch, leaving clues behind to see if it is fate being played out. There is very much a 1930's feel to this film, as it definitely is a story harkening back to many films of that era.    John Cusack does a fine job in this leisurely paced film that ultimately really does have something to say. Jeremy Piven as Cusack's best friend and obit writer gives great support, especially in the last half of the film when Cusack is on his quest to find her again before it is to late. The backdrop of New York and especially the outdoor ice skating rink at night serve to enhance the romantic atmosphere.    Piven gives his buddy Cusack encouragement when he is about to give up by telling him how the Greeks believed to be truly romantic you should expect to be ridiculed and end up looking like a fool. He explains to Cusack how they had no obituaries in ancient Greece but only asked if a man had passion.     This is a movie that encourages us to have passion and go for what we believe in our hearts, no matter what others may say about us. In Piven's words: \\"Look like a jackass!\\" John Cusack plays this like a real guy we can identify with and Kate Beckinsale is full of charm and gives a sweet luminous performance, reminiscent of a Margaret Sullavan.    This is a really nice film that ends well and surprises us. I would encourage anyone to buy this film. It has a quiet charm all its own and has a little something to say along the way.
0140042520|5.0|The Dharma Bums, by Jack Kerouac, follows Ray Smith, a character based on Kerouac himself, through an amazing physical and spiritual journey. In the story, Smith meets Japhy Ryder, an eccentric mountaineer who is fascinated by Eastern literature and religion. Japhy inspires Smith to begin his career as a meditating, rucksack-wielding `Zen Lunatic'. Smith is led to a deeper understanding of his Buddhist faith through scaling mountains, sleeping in silent deserts, and meditating for hours on end deep in the woods. He travels all over the United States, meeting innumerable different characters as he goes and learning more and more about the truths of existence itself. <br /> What shines through in The Dharma Bums isn't so much the plot of the story, but the way in which the story is told. Jack Kerouac has a knack for making the ordinary seem extraordinary, and impressing upon the reader how something seemingly mundane could impact him in a profound way. The narrative has a wide-eyed romance about it, making every experience Ray Smith has seem new and fresh. People, places, and events in the book are described with a prose that is practically poetry, painting a vivid picture in the reader's mind. In reading The Dharma Bums, I wasn't concerned as much with what happened as I was with how it happened. <br /> The Dharma Bums isn't a book that everyone would enjoy. Some would find it pointless or long-winded, or difficult to read. For someone who likes a lot of description and feeling in a book, however, I strongly recommend it. This book is also a necessity for any enthusiast of Beat literature, and even those interested in Buddhism would appreciate it as a serious philosophical work. To anyone else, The Dharma Bums is bound to add inspiration, excitement, and a new perspective to any open mind. <br />

I liked that the book was an easy, yet highly interesting read. The parts that took place in Italy were extremly detailed and highly acurate and made me visualize that I was actually there. Overall this was a great book that made for an easy, yet interesting read.

0446677450|1.0|Like others have said, the author simply lists logical steps to becoming wealthy that might as well be common sense to most people, such as saving more than you spend. He takes a couple of simple ideas and keeps on talking about them throughout the length of the book, without any real content...he seems to just be talking for the sake of talking. I tried to read as much as I could but simply could not swallow all the drivel.<br /><br />As for Kiyosaki himself, you need simply go to these websites and learn a bit more about him before you pluck down your hard-earned money to buy this book.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]
1401301010|5.0|I am a huge RHCP fan and when this book came out I bought it right away... and I couldn't put it down. <br /> <br />This book really gives you a look into every aspect of sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll as a whole. Anthony Kiedis goes through every detail that accompainied him as the Chili Peppers rose to fame. He talks about losing some of his closest friends to drugs and how he had to continuously deal with the bad choices he made early in life, and the fond memories of making some of the greatest rock ever.  <br /> <br />If you are a Chili Peppers fanatic like me... this book is wonderful.
0393035158|5.0|After listening to an interview with Sam Harris on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, I went to my Local Public Library to borrow the book The End of Faith. (being semi retired I only buy a few books a year...) 241 people had requested it before me, but I waited patiently and last Saturday, after 6 months waiting, my turn finally came.  <br />A few pages into the book, I went to buy my own copy. This is a book I must own! (This also allowed me to return the borrowed copy to the 243rd person on that extensive list...) <br />It has been a long time since a book like this came into my hands. It is somewhat unsettling to see one's innermost beliefs on paper, but now supported with many facts that I ignored, but suspected. (I have read very little of the Bible, and almost nothing of the Koran!). Worst of all was to read an author, reflecting one's deepest fears. But, alas, there is also some hope in its pages! <br />The previous age of terror, instituted by the Inquisition, was brought to task by a single powerful document: the 95 Theses of Martin Luther, nailed to the door of the Wittenberg Cathedral in the early 1500's. From there came the Reformation, and with it the Renaissance and all that entailed to modern civilization! <br />Risking the danger of falling into hyperbole, please allow me to preaface my comments with \\"in my humble opinion...\\" But to me this book has the potential to start the next Reformation.  <br />It even has within its possible solutions the seed for the next Renaissance, this time not of a scientific and artistic nature, but a political one: \\"We need a world government. How else will a war between the United States and China ever become as unlikely as a war between Texas and Vermont?\\" (page 151). Could we please call that \\"Thesis Number 96\\" and start working, not tomorrow, but this evening, towards its achievement? <br />There are organizations dedicated to place a Bible in the hands of every person on the planet. I imagine the Muslims musthave a similar organization to spread the Koran. I will contribute a \\" thite\\" (10% of my modest income, I think that means...) to any organization that starts the project to place a translated copy of \\"The End of Faith\\" in the hands of every human being in this blue planet of ours...
0553573403|5.0|Let me just say that I read the first three books a year ago and have been anxiously awaiting the 4th in the series for some time now. So with this I am judging the first three at once. And I have to say that this is the best fantasy series that I have come across. I think that I have read over a hundred fantasy, not science fiction, books in my time and none of them compare in the over all sweep of imagination that Martin hands us here. Robert Jordan, Tolkein, et all... these authors could learn a thing or two from Martin.<br /><br />I just want to caution the prospective reader because these novels unfold gradually. Martin is not in a hurry to resolve the plot lines or take us from one action scene to the next as quickly as possible. Instead we become more and more acquainted with the main characters and when suspense calls, it is all the more terrifying for the interludes.<br /><br />Also I don't think that Martin knows how this series will end. I think that he might have had an idea and that it is evolving as he writes it. Which is great because instead of taking easy endings he is not only introducing new main characters into the story line but also drastically eliminating a few of those that have become too dear. So you just wont know what direction this series will turn next, and that is very refreshing. I think that this is a primary reason that these books succeed in becoming more engaging with every turned page.<br /><br />Pallisners 'Quincunx' though it is a historical novel and seen through the eyes of one character instead of a myriad of them would be the one book that I would recommend if you were looking for something similar to this series. I say this because the plot of 'Quincunx' is so incredibly complex (as is this series) it becomes a tour de force in many ways.
B00003CY5J|5.0|Until this film, I'd never heard of Edward Norton. He is an exceptional actor and I have since discovered him in \\"Primal Fear\\" (even better than \\"The Score\\").  <br /> <br />DeNiro and Norton make the perfect team; young turk vs. old pro, combining their talents to pull off one last major heist. The story line, the exceptional acting and the superb use of understated music and sound make for an outstanding thriller-drama. Don't even hesitate buying this (or anything Edward Norton is in) on DVD.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This movie is so funny it hurts,LITERALLY!!!!I thought I was going to die when I saw both the sex and the vomit scenes.I had heard about how funny the scenes were and I thought that they could'nt be as funny as everyone said they were,but little did I know.I should've known better than to doubt the genius of Parker and Stone.They really outdid themselves on this one and it shows.If you thought South Park,Orgazmo,Baseketball or Cannibal were funny,you ain't seen nothin' yet.If I were you,I'd be the first in line to get this on dvd(I will be) THIS ONE KICKS @$$!!!!!!
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|When this cd first came out I was a bit skeptical because i was a huge fan of SONGS FOR THE DEAF and I wasn't sure if they would be able to top it, but I was dead wrong, when I finally started to actually listen to this disc.  It reminds me of R which to tell you the truth is my favorite QOTSA cd, but this one is tied as my favorite QOTSA disc.  All the songs are well written and produced very well, they are still great live I recently saw them at the vic and was impressed with there show so thats when I decided to give LULLABIES TO PARALYZE another chance and I'm glad I did because it is now up there with R and I can listen to it over and over again without skipping any of the songs.  I agree there are filler tracks but not to many which makes this a great cd.  So far I'd have to say this is the best of 2k5 but I'm not sure because I'm waiting patiently for the new AUDIOSLAVE and SOAD cd's.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin Degraw is a very spiritual, down to Earth artist.  He speaks from his heart and lets his emotions pour as he sings like it's nothing.  When I first heard one of his songs, he touched my soul deep within me.  You know he's a good guy and he's endured many obsticles in life. Love is something so special that is priceless that words can't always describe.  In the \\"Chariot\\" soundtrack, Gavin DeGraw, expresses himself really well and the words flow just right.  You know he has worked hard to be where he is know, mentally and physically.  He is a one of a kind original artist and deep in my heart he deserves a five!!  Good luck in life!!
0898705525|5.0|G. K. Chesterton's \\"Orthodoxy\\" is a timeless text defending the orthodoxy of orthodoxy. Using his personal journey from intellectual atheist to intellectual Christian (no, that's not an oxymoron) as a roadmap, Chesterton brilliantly traces the rhyme and reason for belief in the historic, orthodox doctrines of Christianity.<br /><br />Amazingly, his descriptions of the intellectual climate of his times reads like a weatherman's prognostications for today's weather conditions. Writing fifty years before the supposed advent of post-modernity, Chesterton's defense of Christianity as the one true meta-narrative addresses post-modernism powerfully, relevantly, and effectively.<br /><br />Combine this with the poetry of his prose and his experiential honesty, and you have a book without peer in addressing the crying need of our day. I highly recommend \\"Orthodoxy\\" not only for the thinking (and perhaps doubting) Christian, but also for the seeking agnostic.<br /><br />Reviewer: Dr. Robert W. Kellemen is the author of \\"Soul Physicians: A Theology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,\\" \\"Spiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,\\" and \\"Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Leagcy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\\"
B000002LEU|5.0|I was pretty young when Joy Division were working.  Growing up in suburban America among \\"nice people\\" who thought any music after the Beatles was a travesty, if not a sin against heaven and earth, I was pretty well along in life and in the development of my musical tastes before I found this band.   <br /> <br />By that time, thankfully, I'd branched out a little to discover some of my other faves -- The Stone Roses, Jesus and Mary Chain, the Pixies, etc.   <br /> <br />When I first heard Joy Division, my original thought was \\"this sounds like everything else I listen to.\\"  It was only then that I realized that Joy Division predated all of the rest by about 10 years.  Even today, I listen to a band like Interpol and it's hard not to hear echoes of Ian Curtis' tortured vocals and Martin Hammond's groudbreaking production. <br /> <br />This album is a great collection of some remarkable music.  If you've never heard anything from Joy Division, this is a great place to start.  And start you must, because if you like any \\"rock\\" or \\"electronic\\" music at all that's not mass-produced crud, odds are it owes some debt to Joy Division.
B0006FO8RA|1.0|Honestly the only good tracks are Toxic & I'm a Slave 4U. The rest is junk. To have a greatest hits this early in the game is ridiculuous. That's why \\"greatest\\" cannot apply, also for the fact that the songs stink. To compare her to Madonna is even worse. The problem with Britney is that she a manufactured paper doll. She's cute, but her vocal are severely weak. Like Janet Jackson, she mumbles most of her lyrics and is extremely nasal. It's hard to see any sincerity in her music since most of it is written and produced by factories.  <br /> <br />As much as I love Madonna's music, she does not make the weak \\"Me Against the Music\\" any better. Making alliance with this girl can only hurt Madonna's career.  <br /> <br />Maybe the greatest hits package is the final chapter in her less than impressive \\"career\\". Let's hope she makes a better mother than a singer.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Thank God this album came out actually. I was really waiting for that big break where Mariah would've come through. The Emancipation of Mimi is really one of Mariah's best albums to date for me here. since her last few albums I think this is her ground. Glitter and Charmbracelet were okay. But this is something different instead of tormenting us with her screechy vocals like in Glitter and Charmbracelet. This in turn is more subtle and gentle to the ears. I like that. Instead of her traditional formula for her albums she just mixed it up and came up with this one which the sounds very new and lovely to grooe along to. A very big well done to Mariah herself.  <br />    I knew she would come through. And she doesn't go all high pitched and screams like anything. But she uses it as a beautiful tool on this album. Especially her new single \\"It's Like That\\" which really shows that Mariah has changed to a new sound. Indeed I can safely say that \\"The Voice\\" is back. Give this album a spin and see for yourself guys. The choice is yours.
0380820846|5.0|This was another winner.  Finally, Mrs. Whistledown is revealed in <br />this book.  This book gets 5 stars alone on one scene where Colin &  <br />Penelope embark on an afternoon delight.  I believe a mirror is <br />mentioned.  That was the hottest Julia Quinn love scene I have read to date.  I honestly don't know what else to say, I think the other reviewers have said it all.
0684803356|5.0|I had put off reading this book because I felt it would be \\"boring.\\" I was so very, very wrong! Granted, I have not read everything Hemingway has written, but I find it difficult to believe he could have written anything to surpass this novel. I am thankful that I read \\"A Farewell To Arms\\" and \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" before reading this book, as it would have set the standard too high. <br /> <br />In the previous books by Hemingway that I've read, he didn't seem to develop the characters fully and many of the scenes were only the sparcest of details. It seemed much had to be filled in by the reader. But 15 years after writing \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" Hemingway breaks through with \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls!\\" In this book, Hemingway gives depth to his characters - the reader comes to know, understand, and identify with each character in this book. Hemingway also provides a wonderful description of the area. One can almost envision the mountains and villages and the bridge, which plays a central role. During the scenes involving fighting, the reader can almost hear the gun shots and watch the anguish of those injured or killed. Even in the quiet times of the book, the reader can easily place themselves at the same table as the characters and truly feel they are a part of the story.  <br /> <br />The ending is easily figured out, but that doesn't seem to matter. Even though the reader might suspect or even know what is to happen, the events leading up to it keep the reader enthralled. <br /> <br />This book is a real page-turner, and Hemingway at his best. This is not just a \\"guy's book\\" - not at all! This is a story for both genders. Treat yourself to a literary masterpiece! You will not be disappointed!
B00062ZE3U|4.0|Like many people, I liked Evanescence's single \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" but found the rest of the album somewhat lacking. Imagine my surprise when I found the rest of the album here, on Within Temptation's \\"Silent Force.\\"<br /><br />I grabbed this CD on a whim and was pleasantly surprised by how much I listened to it, with it rapidly finding a place on my \\"most listened to list.\\" I hipped my Evanescence-listening friends to it as well and, to a person, they thought it was great as well.<br /><br />So, while longtime fans of WT may call this a sellout, I just found it an enjoyable listen. Why this didn't enjoy the rampant success of \\"Fallen\\" is beyond me, as this is a considerably more accomplished CD.
0385336810|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's nothing groundbreaking, but a nice guilty pleasure. Funny that the book is titled CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET? since none of the characters in the book can! The book revolves around Emma, a woman in her mid 20s who is unlucky in life. She's finally given a chance to prove herself and get a possible promotion while on a trip overseas, but she mucks it up and goes back home. On the flight she encounters a man and she tells him every little secret that she has. Unbeknowst to her, he is her boss! Feeling so embarrassed by revealing so much, she tries to avoid him. He starts to romance her and she ends up falling for him, only to find that he's exposed all of her secrets to everyone! Mortified she shuts him out of her life, but this proves to be too hard. Overall it was a great, fun book to read.
B000028U0Y|5.0|When i heard this album on an 8 track cassette in 1975 i was stunned by the good singing by Johnny Cash.  Now that i got it on an cd complete it is even better.I love the song \\"Greystone chapel\\" written by Glen Shirley.What an amazing good performance Johnny is doing on this,an perfect gospel song.Buy it you won`t regret it.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Van Helsing is a movie that is about average. The plot to the movie is nothing special. I think it was a cross between enjoyable and cheesy. I would also like to say that I saw this on the big screen and it was much better there. <br /> <br />There is action in this movie, but at times it is simply boring. Also, it is very hard to 'get lost' and not understand what is happening. The movie relies heavily on special effects, and those special effects are nothing special.  <br /> <br />Overall, this was an enjoyable movie, but I would recommend simply renting it over purchasing
B00000IAU3|5.0|This is a great albumn to listen for a rainy day. That's just the feel I got from listening to this albumn. Most of the songs in there are cold and even sad. And Dido's voice is perfect for those songs, a little detached, and a little cold.  <br /> <br />The surprising thing is that most of the songs are even quite catchy. After listening to the albumn a few times, you would be able to sing along with it.  <br /> <br />This is definitely an albumn worth buying. <br /> <br /> <br />Purple_Garden <br />
078681859X|5.0|This book was truly amazing: it is a book that one can read over and over again and yet not grow tired of it. The author, Jonathan Stroud, take a plot of high originality of magicians and fantasy and places it in modern-day London.  <br /> <br />This book is magical full of lies, betrayal and deceit: a combination that makes a great book! There is a very strong series of character development (the characters' personalities shine though clear!). The plot is strong and highly original, even for the modern-day fantasy genre. <br /> <br />It is full of a heavy plot along with some severe twists that are really unexpected. I would also like to remark that this is not for those of lower reading level; there is some `upper' vocabulary. This is a `young adult' book, but I would recommend it for all ages (with the exception of those of lower reading level) <br /> <br />I would strongly recommend a book. I bought it, bought the sequel, and await the third in the trilogy. To be honest, I rate this way up there will Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. IT'S THAT GOOD! Great for kids and adults alike. In other words, it's one of my favorite books ever!
B0007GAERG|5.0|This lady has proven to be the real talented singer one more time, this album is one so cool, catchy, highly recomended! <br />Her voice sound amazing, the club songs (we missed those) are back! <br />MARIAH CAREY THE #1
B00005JNRB|5.0|Last night I saw Sahara...the first movie that came to mind was National Treasure. While they are both similar with the 'treasure hunter' style/concept and the group of characters, I think they are both great.     Sahara is one of those rare movies that are appropriate for most age categories. The plot is a bit shaky. It goes back from one thing to another, and the end came quickly with some rushed 'tie-ups'.    There is a decent amount of action in this movie as well as mystery. Not orthodox suspense, but getting there. The movie starts with a bang, which really catches the viewers attention.    I think that I also liked this movie because of the humor in it. One of the characters is those funny/stupid personalities that really fits. For example, they're being chased by boat. One character gives the other a flare gun. The man replies To signal for help?....of course not! To shoot the guys with guns! See what I mean?    overall, this movie was great. I would definitely classify it in the category of National Treasure (also a great movie). If you liked National Treasure, you'll like Sahara.    I'd suggest seeing it on the big screen, while available. I think the price of admission is completely worth it.
B0002X314C|5.0|After listening to this CD I understand why it got such rave reviews, It posesses all the things a excellent CD has, it talks about real life situtations that most people can relate to, it has phenomonal music, powerful lyrics, and last but not least a powerful and brillant voice behind it all.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Presence is my second favorite 'sit down and listen through' Zeppelin CD, after their first album.  I appreciate Zep's harder, faster side, and this album keeps rocking!  I would rate 'Achilles Last Stand' as Zep's second best song, after Stairway.  It is the perfect rock n roll song, with fast guitars and mean drumming.  The guitar solo by Page is one of my all time favorites (from any band!), and reminds me emotionally of Gilmour's solo on 'Time'.  After reading other reviews here I am delighted to see that I'm not the only Zep lover who thinks that 'Tea for One' is a fantastically awesome song!  I wouldn't describe myself as a huge blues fan, but Zeppelin does it perfectly, and 'Tea' shows it - I feel it to the core of my soul on every listen!  Other personal favorites here are 'For Your Life' and 'Nobody's Fault'.  Zep rocks!!
0440237688|1.0|Well I read this book when I was in 5th grade, exited that it would be a good book from reforences my mom had. <br />I absolutly hate it!!! it is confusing, sad,and for me was an unnessisary read.  I loved the authers writing stile and I liked number the stars I just don't think it a good book and would HATE to have to read it again!  I would not recomend it for any one under 7th grade thinking about it that would have been abetter time for me to have read something as nerv-rakking as that,when I was reading the book my Mom picked it up to read a few pages and stumbled upon the very sad part where they kill imperfect babys
B0007OCG56|5.0|I'm still in shock and so pleased that Hollywood produced a movie in which a possibly illegal Mexican maid says no to a wealthy Anglo chef, though both clearly have romantic love for each other, because, \\"When you have children, there are some mistakes you do not make.\\"  WOW!  Not only did she say no because it was a bad example for her child--she called the temptation to give in to lust (aka romance, love) a mistake!  Bravo.  Yes, the chef's wife had cheated on him.  Yes, the maid is single and innocent and did not try to seduce him.  Yet, it would still be wrong to embrace the affections of a married man--and the maid (Flor) won't go there. <br /> <br />The other climatic scene has Flor rejecting a scholarship for her daughter to attend an exclusive college prep academy because she believes it will rob her daughter's soul and identity.  The star struck daughter is devestated and publicly scorns her mother.  Full of patience, mother lets her stew for awhile, then gently queries, \\"Do you really desire to be so different from me?\\"  Daughter ponders, and finally hugs her mother, realizing that to have a champion parent that is so strong and devoted is a far greater advantage than the \\"right school amongst the right people.\\" <br /> <br />Bottom-line:  This film offers interesting cross-cultural insight and humor, fun and adorable acting that is indeed chick-flickish, and very sound morality.  This is indeed a diamond in the ruff--something people of faith are longing to see more of in Hollywood movies!  BRAVO!
B00005JJX8|5.0|I have been chided for saying this, but Grace Kelly in this movie is a stone cold fox. Just peep the cover!<br /><br />Great movie by the way. Cary Grant is super cool. Beautiful scenery. Lovely camera work. Oh, and Grace Kelly is a stone cold fox.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I first heard the song \\"All the Things She Said\\" on the radio, I was addicted at the age of 12.  Now I am 15 and I finally got around to buying it recently.  I also loved the song \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\", which was also popular and is also uncluded with this CD.  The two songs I mentioned above are some of the best included, and a couple others I enjoyed were \\"Clowns\\" and \\"How Soon Is Now\\".  I have to admit that \\"Malchik Gay\\" was a little weird, but it's wasn't as weird as some of the Disney songs kids are listening to now.    Julia and Lena (the members of t.A.T.u.) are from Russia and have the prettiest voices I have ever heard.  I definitely think I spent my money well.  Please don't let the fact that they are seem Lesbian keep you from buying this, because their music is just as good as it would've been if they were straight.    This CD also has a music video of \\"All the Things She Said\\" included.  Hope I could help!
1881273156|4.0|This book has been helpful in understanding the different needs of people...it not only helps marriages, it helps other relationships too...friends, family, etc.  A good read.  The questions in the back are somewhat open-ended which can be a little intimidating, but nonetheless helpful.
B00006IU73|5.0|Until a few days ago I had never heard of Porcupine Tree, much less this CD.  Thanks to internet radio, I discovered the band as well as \\"In Absentia\\" and I was floored.  I absolutely love this disc!  Coming from a progressive rock background, but incorporating heavier rock influences as well as soulful ballads into a single package makes this one of them most interesting and enjoyable listening experiences I've had in a looong time!  I've been unable to stop listening to it and absolutely recommend it!
0553274503|4.0|This story is ingenious and realistic.  I've never read a story even similar to this one before.  It is one of those stories that just brings out every emotion.  This original novel by Daniel Keyes receives my highest recommendations.      This is the story of a mentally disabled man, named Charlie, who is given a second chance to live a normal life.  After an experiment on a lab rat greatly improved its intelligence, Dr. Strauss is convinced that Charlie should be the first human to undergo the same operation as the rat, Algernon.  Every day Charlie must write a progress report on what happened each day.  After the operation, these reports rapidly improve.  The grammar, spelling, and punctuation get better with each progress report.    After a while, Charlie is allowed to look after himself.  He gets a job at a bakery and even rents his own apartment.  As the operation aimed to do, Charlie now lives a normal life.  Throughout the story, Charlie reflects on his not so great childhood, and what it was like, while he discovers his new, improve.    This book is moving, and causes you to discover a newfound great respect for the mentally disabled, who are just like anyone else, except with the misfortune of a life-changing disability.  This is definitely a novel that I encourage anyone to read.  By Tyler H.
B00030590I|2.0|This film does indeed look good, sound good, and has some nice aspects to it.  But, come on.  All of these glowing reviews ignore the fact that this movie is a rip off of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It is shown to us in slow motion (most of the film is in slo mo). It also is basically a propaganda film spouting communist themes (\\"one land\\"...\\"one party\\", sound familier?).  Jet Li's character won't kill this terrible, brutal tyrant, because a united land under a evil dictator is better than 7 different kingdoms?  Get real.  This is one boring movie, and all the wire fighting and color schemes in the world won't change that.  See this movie for what it really is, mellodramatic cheese.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Almost all of the 1200+ reviews are in praise of this show.  I won't be any different.  It is superb.  I disagree with negative feedback that says that there is too much disbelief to suspend.  At first the anachronistic quality of bullet firearms and the juxtaposition of cowboy/pioneer frontierism seems overwhelming and odd, not to mention the peppering of Chinese in the speech and Eastern clothing popping up, but this discomfort passes quickly when one realizes that it is genius.  The actors, the writing--especially the dialogue, the graphics, the music and the story arcs are all so good and compelling.  It was a travesty that this show was cancelled.  Thank God the film is being made.  You will not be disappointed by purchasing this set.
B0006GAI6Y|3.0|It wasn't bad, I just hoped for more I guess.  There were a few scenes that came across as plain silly and ridiculous thus making it hard to watch at times.  Richard Gere tries hard but I thought Lopez's performance was best, really quiet and understated.  Susan Sarandon's role wasn't very challenging, for an actress that talented, you'd have thought they'd have given her more.
0345451325|4.0|When I first saw the series of 3 Halo books, I took a pass.  They had all the hallmarks of the chronically bad \\"novelizations\\" of popular movies, especially science fiction movies.  Microsoft even owns the copyright, which seemed like a harbinger of doom.<br /><br />Anyhow, I played my way through Halo 1 and got hooked, so I picked up the three volume set.  While Nylund isn't exactly John Grisham, or even David Weber, the book was a surprisingly good read--the pacing was pretty quick, considering how many years are covered in the book, and I found myself feeling like I understood the characters in the game (particularly the Master Chief and Cortana) better.  The plot is plausible, as far as science fiction stories go, and the characters are pretty well-defined.<br /><br />In fact, it was the departures from the game's storyline that left me a bit puzzled, although the differences are subtle enough that you really can't call them contradictions.  For one thing, it's pretty clear in both games that the Master Chief is the last of the Spartan-II supersoldiers.  That gets fudged more than a bit in this and the subsequent two novels.  Other minor details were annoying but not really hazardous to the book's health.  For example, in the book, Cortana spends time inside the Master Chief's suit, and was intended to go there.  The first game, however, implies pretty strongly that Cortana's never been inside the Chief's \\"head\\" before, and that the transfer of the AI to the Master Chief is an emergency measure only.<br /><br />That said, it's probably too much to expect a novel that's a prequel to a video game to be 100% consistent with the video game's story line (and it's a testament to Bungie, the makers of Halo, that there was so much story line to work with and work around).  If you haven't played the game, you're unlikely to buy this book (or to have read this far in my review, for that matter).  If you do have the game, you'll enjoy this book and the two that follow--just make sure you finish Halo I before you read the second two books.low--just make sure you finish Halo I before you read the second two books.
B00005JLPK|5.0|I have seen Frida five times at the cinemas, and got the DVD as a gift. I must say that this is by far the most visually stunning, inspirational, and emotionally impacting film I have ever seen. Before this movie came out, I went the Vancouver Art Gallery to see some of Frida Kahlo's paintings and saw the documentary of her life. I was very fascinated by several of paintings, but I didn't get to see The Two Fridas or the paintinngs with the monkeys. I was moved to tears by the documentary of her life, and I instantly became a fan. I then bought the novel based on her life, and read it before the movie came out. I was dying to see the movie.<br /><br />This beautiful biopic is directed by the Julie Taymor, whose film Titus was an equally visual feast. It's a dream come true for the Oscar nominated Salma Hayek, who had spent more that seven years trying to get this movie made. It was a good thing that Madonna and Jennifer Lopez didn't get to do it, because they wouldn't be suitable to play Frida. Salma Hayek gave the performance of her career, and she actually hadn't done anything great before this movie, except for In The Times Of The Butterflies, which also costarred Mia Maestro who played her sister in both movies. Even though Salma lost the award to the overrated Nicole Kidman(The Hours), Frida still won two out of the six nominations. The music composed by Elliot Goldenthal trully capture the spirit of Frida and Mexico. Some of the songs are sung by Lila Downs, and Chavela Vargas. Burn It Blue heard at the end of the film is so beatiful. I even bought the soundtrack. Salma Hayek had more than fifty costumes here, designed by Julie Weiss on a shoestring budget. She made Hayek looked stunningly beautiful and striking, especially the photo shoot for the Paris Vogue cover, and the scene when she steps into her painting The Two Fridas.<br /><br />This movie chronicles the life and times of Frida and Diego Rivera(played by the underrated Alfred Molina), a womanizing fellow artist, mentor, and husband. Frida had endured a great deal of physical, emotional, and spiritual pain, and she survived, because she was strong and self-absorbing, and she transcend her life's most unforgetable moments onto the cavas in the form of surrealism that's autobiographical. From the bus accident that left her crippled for life to her stormy marriage to Rivera, to miscarriage, to international stardom, to heartaches of failed marriage and distant from her parents, to betrayed by her sister....and then there's the self-destructive behaviours(alcohol addiction and promiscuous sex with men and women). Life without Diego was meaningless to her at times. She intensionally had an affair with Leon Trotsky(a Russian Communist in exile played Geoffrey Rush) to provoke or repay Diego for his infidelity. She still loved him even when they were separated for a period of time, leaving her financially and physically devastated, that's when she painted her best work including The Two Fridas, which was one of the high points in the film. The reconcilation and remarriage of Frida and Diego was a heartfelt experience.<br /><br />The supporting cast are all superb. Alfred Molina was overlooked by the Oscar, he should've been nominated for best supporting actor, even though he doesn't look a whole lot like the actual Diego Rivera. I thought Valeria Golino was very good too. She played Diego's ex-wife, and she stole scene in this movie. Mia Maestro was great as Christina Kahlo, she was seduced by Diego to bed when she posed for his paintings. The affair broke Frida's heart. I also enjoyed Patricia Reyes Spindola's portrayal of Mrs. Kahlo. She was always negative about the choices Frida made in love and career. As for the big-star cameros which including Antonio Banderas(David Siqueiros), Ashley Judd(Tina Modotti), and Salma's ex-boyfriend Edward Norton(Nelson Rockefeller) who co-wrote the screenplay, I loved Judd's performance the most. Her sexy \\"lesbian\\" dance number with Salma Hayek was quite a treat.<br /><br />Salma Hayek gave a mesmerizing and multi-layered performance, and she was in every scene. She trully transformed herself in all aspects of character and showed the world that she's not just a bombshell, but a great actress to be taken seriously. I cried during several scenes including the scene when she got dumped by her first boyfriend(Alejandro/Diego Luna). I was also moved a great deal by the miscarriage, and the scene when she was devastated and started to cut her hair and got very drunk. The most powerful scene was when she was drinking and crying while listening to an old lady(Chavela Vargas) sang a ballad to her, and she went home and stepped into her painting(The Two Fridas).The music, cinematography, acting, art direction, editing, and direction all worked together to achieve a very memorable experience. The special features has some very good materials included, and I really enjoyed the interviews on Julie Taymor, Salma Hayek, and the singers and composers.<br /><br />I loved this movie and worship Frida. I admired her life's work as an artist, and her endurance of pain and struggles, and ultimately her relentless passion for love and creativity. I also collected the soundtrack, the Frida screenplay with photos of many of the scenes from the film, the postcard book, and a wall fabric drape painted with Frida and the Monkeys.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a must-see for artist, art lover, fashion lover, music and cultural fans, and of course all Salma Hayek fans too!er with Salma Hayek was quite a treat. <br /> <br />Salma Hayek gave a mesmerizing and multi-layered performance, and she was in every scene.

B000002MUN|5.0|I absolutley love this album.  Tom Petty became very popular with me when I first heard this album in the 5th grade. I have allways enjoyed putting it in and rockin' out.  As I was thinking about it, I can not pick out a song that I like the most, I like them all, well love them all, not one of them do I not like (which is rare in any album).  It is has a very up-beat, positive, go-with-the-flow, hippie feel on every track, it's great!  Tom Petty's best album and possibley the best album of all time.  It is a true gem!!
B0006A9FMI|2.0|Having programed on the visual systems they used for GITS2, they did a great job......being a political science major who enjoys philosophic debates.....not bad.....but unfortunately i am also a sci-fi fan and the plot gets really bogged down about half way into the movie......the biggest problem for me and a real annoying feature that i wish AMAZON would correct is tell us when something is a NON-ENGLISH soundtrack.....unless you understand Japanese you have to have subtitles......this is unfortunate that dreamworks did not create an English version as they did in Ghost in the Shell 1 or its tv version \\"stand alone complex\\"........so i have to down grade it for that because to keep up with the story you have to keep pressing the pause button to read the dialog and then go on.....shame on you dream works and shame on amazon.com for not warning us with a warning label.....
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain debuted on the country music scene in 1993,but there are no tracks from her debut album on this one. Let's give the credit to her husband,producer Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange for keeping his wife's career strong. FROM THIS MOMENT ON from 1997's COME ON OVER does not have Bryan White joining her as he did with her on that Grammy winner. It's basically the same recording but minus White's vocals. Also there's THAT DON'T IMPRESS ME MUCH,also from COO,but in dance form,ideal for nightclub play. Other COO tracks are the ass-kicking MAN! I FEEL LIKE A WOMAN!,YOU'RE STILL THE ONE,HONEY I'M HOME and DON'T BE STUPID. From 2002's UP!,is the title track,FOREVER AND FOR ALWAYS and I'M GONNA GETCHA GOOD. From 1995's THE WOMAN IN ME is YOU WIN MY LOVE which kicks ass. New tracks include DON'T,I AIN'T NO QUITTER which is rockabilly-flavored,and two \\"party\\" songs,one each with a different guest artist. The other tracks are great!

B0006A9FMI|5.0|Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence: is extraordinary.  Director Mamoru Oiishi has done the seemingly impossible in surpassing the first Ghost in the Shell.  Fans of the first film will be mesmerized by Oishi's vision of a desolate urban-mecha society where organic life is the minority.  The music fits the movie excellently, echoing mournfully into the vast city so full of life and yet so lifeless, a cry that goes unanswered.<br /><br />In this postmodern sci-fi anime, interesting questions are raised such as \\"Why are humans so obsessed with duplicating themselves?\\" and \\"How exactly do you define a human?\\" Here most people have input devices on the back of their necks with which they can share information.  Even the most organically human character in the film, Batou's partner, reaches over and plugs in as if he were reaching for his wallet.  I tell you, it is unsettling.<br /><br />Innocence does not have bodacious cyborg-babe Motoko, who was the central character in the first movie.  Any fanboys wanting cheesecake or fanservice had better look elsewhere.  Motoko is in the film, but not until the end, and only as a voice.  The hero in this film is Batou, the cyborg who has been living the last three years without his love Motoko, when she disappeared into cyberspace.  Motoko and Batou have one of the most touching love stories, and I am hoping desperately for a Ghost in the Shell 3.  Innocence is a buddy cop picture, as almost 100 % cyborg Batou is paired with a \\"family man.\\"<br /><br />This futuristic world is not a place you would want to visit, but you cannot tear your eyes away from it.  The animation is simply a visual feast.  All scenes are so realistic, most in 3D animation.  In a way, it watches like a video game.  You feel as though you are in the movie, especially during shooting scenes, as Batou is taking out Yakuza or martial-arts wielding girlie robots dropping from the ceiling.<br /><br />Ghost in the Shell 2 is for hard core anime fans only.  This is not for someone who is just being introduced to anime, or has not seen any serious series such as Neon Genesis Evangelion.<br /><br />The DVD has director commentary as subtitles only.  There is no English dubbing available.

B00005OM4K|5.0|Even if you're not a hardcore CCR fan, you should get this box.  As I've found over the years, CCR has so many great songs that simply aren't on greatest hits compilations and retrospectives.  This set has EVERYTHING they ever recorded, in chronological order from when they were writing chintzy pop through their classic period all the way to the end.  Two live sets are included as well, which were released after Tom Fogerty left the band and CCR continued as a trio.  The sound is great as the whole catalog of songs was remastered.  My one complaint is that their set from Woodstock wasn't included, nor was a retrospective live DVD.  Oh well, I'm probably just being greedy.  Additionally, with the exception of Credence Gold, this set is the only place you can find the full, awesome 9 minute version of Susie Q as well as the complete 45 Revolutions Per Minute (Parts 1 and 2).  All in all, well worth the investment considering what you're getting here (it's cheaper to buy this than all of the albums individually!).
0743454537|4.0|I enjoyed most of this book.  In the study questions at the <br />end, Jodi Picoult says that there was no other way to end this <br />book.  I completely disagree.  She simply went for  <br />sensationalism and a Hollywood script ending rather than <br />how things work in real life. The true ending that normally occurs with families with sick or terminally ill children: <br />The parents divorce with Mom keeping the sick child.

B000002UJQ|5.0|This CD is one of the best in the past 10 or so years.<br /><br />There isn't a bad track and the production brings back a spirit that has been lacking in modern music.<br /><br />Great music doesn't come much better than this.
B0007GAERG|4.0|This is a Mariah CD that has gone back into what works for her and her fanbase. It's not that \\"the voice\\" went away (although it does seem like her voice has changed in the past few years), but that the fans of her work in the 90s didn't like the direction she was taking her music into starting with \\"Rainbow\\" to \\"Charmbracelet\\" (her voice sounds improved since then, but still far from what sounded effortless in the 90s,and I'm not talking about the high octaves).  <br /> <br />She's now a \\"veteran\\" performer 15 years on, and is at the age where the MTV audience sees her as the \\"old guard\\". What was once seen as detrimental to her career is what will keep her on the radio: the collaborations with rappers. It's now normal to hear collaborations, where when she did \\"Fantasy\\" with the late ODB was considered unusual at the time.  <br /> <br />I think that she has a defined style and brought a lot of 70s and early 80s R&B to the table than she has in a long time. I think that this sound gives the entire CD a warm familiar sound through it.  <br />   <br />The pluses: <br />The ballads are more soulful than sappy.  <br />Most of the collaborations are good.   <br />It's something that you'll listen to without skipping over songs.  <br />  <br />The downside of the CD is bringing up stuff like having a house in Capri and packing her Louis Vuitton bag. I thought it was a little silly... The track with Snoop Dogg was good, but I thought he owned the song and would fit better on his CD, but was not her own strongest song on there. The other down side was that the cover was a little too close to Beyonce's solo CD (which I think was done by the same people..not to mention Jay-Z runs her label...)  <br /> <br />But overall, if you're a fan of Mariah, you won't be disappointed. If you liked her and moved on in the past few years, this one is definitely for you to bring you back to her...but if you didn't like her to begin with, this won't convert you.  <br /> <br />Regarding the\\"limited edition\\" version, other than the different cover and a foldout picture (why the 2 promo videos which were in the can before putting this out is beyond me), I don't think that much else is all that different, and more for those that \\"have to have everything\\" by her.  <br />
B0007Y4USW|5.0|After reading the other posted reviews, I wanted to add my 2 or 3 cents worth. It has now been one full week since I purchased Mariah's new CD and my overall opinion agrees with most of those posted so far: THIS IS A GREAT CD!! <br />Emancipation of Mimi (EOM) may be Mariah's best overall CD ever topping her debut CD from 1990 and Butterfly (her previous best) from 1997. <br />What makes the CD is its STRUCTURE. The song selection and order creates a CD that one will not tire of for a long time. I've always felt most Mariah Carey CD's had way too many ballads especially toward the end so that I lost interest in the CD. EOM is paced beautifully going from outright jams to mid-tempo pop to heartfelt ballads and back again like a 600 thread count comforter. Also, the length of each track is just over 3 minutes long. Perfect for maintaining our attention. This CD should cause radio to remove Mariah from their blacklist. EOM cannot be denied. <br />With that said, here is my review of the tracks: <br />1. It's like that is an out of the box smash and gets stronger each time I here it eventhough I loved it immediately from the start. <br />2. We Belong Together is vintage Mariah and sounds great on radio. My only regret is that this is the second single and I worry that it may get lost after a few spins because its melody sounds TOO MUCH like Lover and Friends by Lil Jon featuring Usher etc. which is currently falling off the charts. <br />3. Shake it up has a nice pop sound that's very catchy after a few plays. It flows like a summer breeze. <br />4. Mine Again is pure Showtime at the Apollo RnB power ballad.One of Mariah's best delivered vocals on a CD with with overall great vocals. <br />5.Say Somethin' with Snoop Dogg may be Mariah's best crafted track in year's. Radio should listen to this!. This Neptune produced track reminds me so much of the Windy and Lisa era of Prince and the Revolution. I would love this to be a single. <br />6.Stay the Night is Mariah's bestvocal performance on the CD. I never get tired of this midtempo track. <br />7. Get Your Number with JD (is Nelly uncredited on this single 'cause the recited hook sounds more like him than JD?) took a couple of listenings and is now in the Top 4 of the best of the CD. You will be nodding your head on this one. <br />8. One and Only with Twista was the first outright smash that jumped out at me. I never wanted this track to end as I fell in love with the slow bass groove that reminded me of a 1970's urban jazz concert. If promoted right, this could be a monster single that has HIT written all over it. There is nothing on current radio airplay that sounds like this track. <br />9. Circles is Mariah's second best vocal performance and could easily be a 4th or 5th single pick. This midtempo tune is very catchy. A great overall track. <br />10. Your Girl is my least favorite track but it is no dud. It grows more and more on me. <br />11. I Wish You Knew with its pseudo in-concert feel remings me so much of Diane Ross' performance on Ain't No Mountain High Enough.  Great lyrics. <br />12. To the Floor (or as Nelly says To da Flo) is a jam that is musically well put together. Another Netune produced track. <br />13. Joyride is a beautiful ballad and may end up being one of the best tracks on the album.  <br />14. Fly Like a Bird ends the CD and sounds just like a finali after an encore. Mariah's spiritual arrival that connects EOM with Butterfly. <br />In conclusion, I would recommend EOM as one of the best that 2005 has offered so far and I see Grammy nominations in its future.
B0007GAERG|5.0|First of all, this is truly an enjoyable album! I have found all Mariah's album great (yes, even Glitter and charmbracelet; actually, I can't see what the fuss is all about), but this album is greater than the other albums she has released so far. This album has definitely made it to my top 3 Mariah Carey albums, along with Butterfly and Glitter. I actually smiled  broadly when I first listened to this album. She is back! After a <br />little disappointing Charmbracelet, in which she sort of makes me tired with her whispery voice (the songs are good, though), she finally comes back with full force in her voice. <br /> <br />Even the songs are better than usual! Take \\"It's Like That\\" for instance, it is a very likeable song with catchy beat and playful lyric. \\"We Belong Together\\" is a perfect for-the-broken-hearted song. The way she soars to the higher octave in the outro really sends a chill to my spine. While \\"Mine again\\" and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" makes me drop my jaws and feel like giving her a standing applause! \\"Stay The Night\\" is really nice, something about this track makes me want to hear it over and over again. \\"Say Something\\" and \\"To The Floor\\" are her collaborations with The Neptunes, which result her strongest beat to date. The other R&B oriented songs are \\"Shake It Off\\" (with funky bass sound, a soon-to-be-hit), \\"Get Your Number\\" (I found J.D's rap very amusing) and \\"One And Only\\" (like listening to a sprint tournament, both Mariah and Twista sing extremely fast; nice though). Meanwhile, the ballads \\"Circles\\" and \\"I Wish You Knew\\" have the soul vibe, which is a pleasant change from the usual big and sweet ballads Mariah is well known for. However, the stand-out tracks are definitely \\"Your Girl\\" and \\"Joy Ride\\". The former has a funny background sound and Mariah sounds very playful in this track; while the latter is a slow jam that will make you have a very very good dream if you listen to it before you go to sleep. <br /> <br />This album has a flaw, of course. Any album has. However, the only flaw I could find so far is how short some of the songs are. Songs like \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Your Girl\\" make you wonder why such a great song end so fast. These tracks will do much better with a nice bridge, like in \\"Joy Ride\\". <br /> <br />Finally, this album is really satisfying. I have read some other reviews and I am really confused with the bad critics, especially the one-star reviews. Have they really listened to this album and not only to the previews? Because previews only give you the shortest bit of a song and you surely can not judge anything from it. Some even claim themselves as \\"a former Mariah fan\\". Ha! Like I'm going to believe it. I'm pretty damn sure they are actually J-Lo fans (or as bad, Britney's) who pretend to be \\"a former Mariah fan\\" to give the effect that Mariah has lost most of her fans. It doesn't work for me, though. I believe Mariah still has lots of fans who are still eagerly waiting for her other releases in the future. And with an album like this, Mariah will surely get a lot of new fans. I bet on it.
B000957O82|4.0|With no offence to any American, I must say this movie is very American. It is rooted in the Capitalistic-American culture, at least in my opinion. <br />You see, it seems to me that the basic consept of this film is that anyone, anyone, can get to the top. Even if you are a fat nerd, you can go for the hottest star in Hollywood, and you have the same chance as anybody to get her. <br />It reminds me of the Capitalistic idea that anyone can get to the top. Since I disagree with this ideal, I disagree with the basic principal of the movie.  <br />You see, although you can find some poor people that have become reach, most of the poor stay poor. It's not their fault, there is a varaity of reasons. Just the same, most nerds don't get the cutest girl around, because that's the way the world works. Only if you are on the right side of life, you have the privilige to get to the top, or to get that girl, and to think that anyone can do it, because you did. <br />Not to mention the fact that there wasn't an avrage looking girl in the entire movie. Hollywood doesn't want you to desire the avrage. You'll go for the top, or for nothing. This I call the creation of a beuty ideal: causing both men and women to look for a certain beuty ideal, created by the media, and so, eventually, every person they choose to spend their lives with, would be a compromise. <br />And here is the double message of this movie: on the one hand it claims anyone can get any girl. On the other hand it serves that very ideal that prevents any guy to get any girl, and vice versa. <br />As a movie it was nice. It was funny and charming and exciting, although it could've been shorter, in my opinion. However, as the light turned on, the illusion faded to quickly, and that's the main problem of the film.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|I thought it was part Dr. Phil, part Osbournes, part Spinal Tap, part \\"Let it Be\\".  <br /> <br />First,a lot of \\"real\\" Metallica fans have to be upset with this, but face it, after the \\"pop metal Black Album\\" cutting their hair, Lollapalooza, symphonies and Napster, a lot of their fans bailed on them. This was originally going to be a \\"reality show\\" a la \\"The Osbournes\\" which started out because Jason left (because they took a \\"my way or the highway\\" attitude), but when Hetfield went into rehab, things really changed.  <br /> <br />What \\"The Osbournes\\" does to Ozzy's fans, this film does to Metallica. It takes them down a peg or two with the hardcore fans of the first 3 albums who want to remember them as how they were.  <br /> <br />I would recommend watching \\"A Year and a Half\\" before or after watching this to compare the change in the band (and showed how annoying Lars was long before Napster and that Hammett is the  glue of the band that keeps the conflicts between Hetfield and Ulrich somewhat stable), as well as \\"Cliff Em All\\" to see them as young guys trying to prove themselves to the world. I also recommend \\"Paradise Lost\\" about the West Memphis Three which features Metallica music and the directors of \\"Monster\\" had worked on prior.  <br /> <br />The highlights are the sitdown with Dave Mustaine and Lars. Hammett and Ulrich seeing Newsted in his new band and looking totally defeated, esp. when their producer sees a lot of their guys working for \\"the enemy\\". Towards the end, the fan appreciation day and bass player tryouts (a lot are well known) are interesting. That they wanted Trujillo as a full fledged member who deserved his fair share and not a bassist for hire shows that they are a true band and not having one person get the lion's share, which occurs with a lot of bands. It's funny to see the counselor give excuses to hang around longer than he should, and that when James comes back, the cracks are already showing when James comes back and has to work for a few hours, to the dismay of the other guys. On one hand, it led to more energy, on the other hand, it may have been a reason why the album didn't do as well as the others, even though it debuted at #1 in many countries.  <br /> <br />It does remind me of \\"Let It Be\\"... The Beatles had used a huge soundstage, Metallica had tried out Army barracks, and you really could see the same things going down, except the Beatles were far more polite on camera (but revealed themselves a lot more on the audio tapes). They both wound up doing it over in the studio, with their producer Bob being the bass player (not too different from what George Martin did). Where the Beatles took to the roof, Metallica took to San Quentin of all places,but unlike the fate that would happen with the Fabs, Metallica ends the film with them in concert.   <br /> <br />I liked James opening up about his childhood on the extras and life on the road in the film, admitting that he was not exactly a good husband, but is working on it. It's great that the directors had access to a lot of old footage to be able to show the band formerly known as \\"Alcoholica\\" that was known to get drunk on stage at almost every show. Lars' dad seems to figure in his music and life a lot, more than he should (his dad was a tennis pro as was Lars before Metallica...). Lars also shows a lot of sadness of what has happened between him and James over the years from kids having a love of music to drifting apart as friends over time. Napster is brought up, but mostly as a news clip. But it also seems that the time that James was in rehab drove Lars to be obsessed in that whole thing.  <br /> <br />You can tell that the late Cliff Burton is still a sensitive subject with the band, something that came up when Jason supposedly considered coming back. Their collective mood changed when they talked about it.  <br />  <br />As far as documentaries go, this is by far one of the best insights to the workings of a successful band at apoint in their career that the end was a real possibility,and James' therapy could have led to the end of Metallica. But their discussion about letting the therapist go as a mutual decision was a sign that this isn't the case.  <br /> <br />Overall, it's a great documentary whether or not you like Metallica's music. It's open, uncut, and shows them as they are, even though there is an awareness of the camera crew.  <br /> <br />But I do think it gives a renewed interest in the \\"St. Anger\\" CD, and an optimistic look towards the future.      <br /> <br />
0689865384|5.0|Tally can't wait the three months until she's sixteen and her surgery transforms her into a pretty. She is sooooo sick of being an ugly. In the meantime, she daringly travels from her dorm in Uglyville to New Pretty Town in order to see her best friend, Peris. When she finds him, newly pretty Peris seems annoyed, asking why Tally couldn't wait the three months to see him. Just as troubling, the tiny scar on his palm matching hers, from their rite of blood brothership, has vanished --- replaced with perfect beautiful skin. <br /> <br />Escaping from New Pretty Town, Tally meets Shay, another ugly waiting to become pretty. The two become great friends, hoverboarding and plotting practical jokes together. When Tally shares her choices for her upcoming transformation (she favors a sultry Cleopatra look), Shay amazes her with her attitude. Shay hasn't even bothered to decide how she'll look as a pretty. <br /> <br />Tally buys the party line taught in school: a world of pretties is the only way to make everyone equal. It solves the long-ago problems of judging people by appearances and waging wars based on skin color. Besides, everyone wants to go through the rite of passage. <br /> <br />Shay persuades Tally to sneak into the restricted area outside the city where she discovers a wild stretch of white water, mountains, trees, and the ruin of an old city. Shay confides that she hopes to meet a mysterious person named David here. Shay's talk troubles Tally. Shay maintains that she not only doesn't want to become a pretty but that the operation is in fact unnatural. She even swears that she and Tally are not freaks as uglies. <br /> <br />As Tally approaches her sixteenth birthday and her transformation, Shay invites her to travel to David's home, the Smoke --- a place where everyone lives together in freedom, where there are no uglies and no pretties. <br /> <br />Naturally, Tally refuses to go. But when her long-anticipated operation day arrives, she is confronted with the frightening Special Circumstances team. Her life takes an unexpected turn when she learns that she must spy on runaway Shay in order to become pretty. Tally plunges into an amazing quest in which the ante constantly ratchets upward, plunging her into one impossible situation after another. <br /> <br />With extreme makeover shows like \\"The Swan\\" transforming people into pretty clones, Tally's world seems creepily not all that far-fetched. UGLIES is not only timely food for thought, but is a breathless, can't-put-it-down read, leaving readers impatient to get their hands on the second book in Scott Westerfeld's trilogy, PRETTIES --- immediately. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com)
B00009MGR6|4.0|This album, compared to other bands and albums of the late 80's, stands prettty tall. The classic thing about AC/DC is the fact that thet never really changed their style, and that is why this album is so good. This holds up well against othe 80's efforts (though no back in black, hardly any come close to that). Just about each track has memorable riffs, and brians voice sounds amazing on this. This is also the last album were he helped write the songs. <br />Track listing <br /> <br />1. Heatseeker - cool riffs, brians sings really well, but there are better on the album 7/10 <br />2. That's the way I wanna rock n roll - very cool track, my fav on the album, bluesly but with a hard rock edge 10/10 <br />3. Meanstreak - A slower track with a good beat, funny lyrics 7/10 <br />4. Go Zone - cathchy tune, not bad but not the best 7/10 <br />5.Kissin Dynamite - my least fav on the album, because I can never remember how it goes 6/10 <br />6. Nick of time  - excellent fast paced track with cool lyrics and guitars, on the best and most memorable 9/10 <br />7. Some Sin for nuthin'  - a good track with a catchy chorus 8/10. <br />8. Ruff Stuff - Great, extremely catchy and memorable, one of my favourite AC/DC sex songs 9/10 <br />9. Two's up - Another good track with great riffs, all the instruments mesh together nicely, but i dont like how the first verse is about gamblin and the second about a threesome, should have kept it about gamblin the whole way through. 8/10 <br />10. This means war - good fast paced track with cool changing riffs, although to me seems a bit like filler 8/10. <br /> <br />It aint the best AC/DC album, but very close to the most underated. Buy this before The Razors Edge.
0385513755|5.0|I was not brought up in a religious house so I have always been a little skeptical when it comes to church doctrine. This is why I found this book so appealing, it gave me the readers digest version of church history and the controversy that surrounds it. It may be fiction, but it's more interesting than plain history/religion.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever recorded, and the one that changed everything that was to come, for better and worse. I liken this one to The Doors' debut in that a majority of their songs to be on future CDs were written by the time this came out. 1/4 of \\"Use Your Illusion\\" were recorded around this time as well as most of the acoustic part of \\"Lies\\". \\"Appetite\\" had a different cover which caused a lot of controversy at the time, and I think that the original cover can still be found.  <br /> <br />Once upon a time, Guns N Roses were a band that caused a storm and were the biggest band out there. Unfortunately, changes were to occur and were never the same ever since. The \\"Use Your Illusion\\" CDs were big hits, but were more sprawling epics than they were great rock songs.  <br /> <br />I think they were classified as a \\"metal\\" band in the beginning (mostly due to their look), but their ties to bands like the Stones were far more obvious,and their roots to punk were probably more closer (even more obvious on their \\"Spaghetti Incident\\" CD).   <br /> <br />Overall, the songs are dark and uncompromising, yet a song like \\"Sweet Child O'Mine\\" winds up in there, kind of like how Eminem will put that one radio-friendly song to draw you in to a far darker world...    <br /> <br />But the band itself is the engine to what propelled this album into being a classic, not just one person. Each of them have a distinct sound on there that can be heard through the entire thing. There are times they might have tried to sound like mid 80s metal (keep in mind Metallica were just starting to be headliners around this time and bands like Motley Crue were riding high), but where most bands were singing about over the top stuff or just having a good time, GnR were talking about personal \\"devils\\" they were facing than most bands were doing.     <br /> <br />There are a couple of songs that some might consider \\"filler\\", but included in this collection of songs it fits just right.  <br /> <br />The only thing I can suggest is that the demos from the sessions, outtakes, the MTV \\"Live at the Ritz\\" and the promo videos be included as part of a \\"Deluxe Edition\\" CD/DVD.  <br /> <br />With or without extras,it's a bona fide classic and a must own.
B000000JO3|5.0|These guys missed the bus a bit in making punk but this cd is definately harder, faster, and more thought out than the stuff the stooges did. These guys have influenced all walks of music and have been a definate cornerstone in DC music. The fact they were all from DC makes up for the fact that Henry Rollins was also from DC. Very few DC artists stay true to their scene i.e. Dj Spooky, Henry Rollins, Hive, ect... The guys who still live here i.e. Thievery Corporation, Dave Grohl, both have nothing to do with this area. The only ones who stay true are Ian Mackaye and Chuck Brown. Kudos to you guys.
B0002NRRAG|1.0|I bought this on the strength of the glowing reviews here, and I can't figure it out.   <br /> <br />This is an awful recording.  Ms. Peyroux has no musicality whatsoever, is often off key, has no sense of phrasing... <br /> <br />The band is competent, not great, but vastly superior to Ms. Peyroux.  But I don't buy a vocalist's recording to listen to the band. <br /> <br />I cannot fathom how this artist has received the reviews she has.  Her voice may be an attempt at a carbon copy of Holiday, but she has none of the depth, and none of the empathy for the material, of the original. <br /> <br />Save your money.  This one joins Jane Monheit and Stacy Kent in the \\"huge disappointment\\" category.
B0002858YS|4.0|I am always seeking bands with different sound, and this band is indeed that. In a way it sounds like the eighties, but they also have their own style which makes the band sound even better. Somebody Told Me was good, but I worried about buying the c.d. because there are always bands with one hit wonders that do not have any better songs than that one hit. Then Mr. Brightside came on the radio and I totally loved it. That song is one of the best I have heard in the past few months and got me to finally buy the c.d. I hoped there were other great songs on there as well- and I was not disappointed. This band is no one hit wonder. I think this band could go quite far.  <br />There are one or two songs on here that I skip that are kind of boring, but most of the songs on here get high approval for me. <br />Other favorite songs of mine that get As are Smile Like You Mean It, All These Things That I've Done, Andy, You're a Star, On Top, and Midnight Show.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0062502182|4.0|Paulo Coelho puts his own views of life and love into his well-written novel The Alchemist. The book begins in a small village inside of Spain's broad grasslands. Santiago, a young man full of ambition, takes his personal legend to find himself and to discover the best way to live his life. On his way to his legend he meets many royals and finds a love of his own. Santiago unravels many views of life long lessons passed to him from his elders and it puts his perspective of the world into a whirlpool of thoughts. Although the story allows Santiago to feel the strong believes of others, in a way the author makes the reader realize this journey is not only for Santiago, but also for them. <br /> <br /> The shepherd boy (Santiago) leaves the grasslands of the Andalusia valley to try and uncover what his reoccurring dreams mean in the views of a boy. He starts his journey by giving up his work with his sheep and rides along the horizon of the mountains covering the grass. He then finds a strange marketplace, and he gets a job to have enough money to buy a camel for his ride through the Sahara desert. On his journey through the desert he meets up with the alchemist and they trot along together until Santiago finds his way of life. Even with the road of treacherous terrain Santiago once more had enough energy to laugh about his personal legend in the desert sands. <br /> <br /> I found The Alchemist to be new and original for an otherwise heart-warming story of phenomenons. I could tell the author didn't just write his story, but he felt the emotions of a lost and lonely boy in the desert. The Alchemist would be a great read for any type of person interested in mystery or phenomenon. I would recommend anyone trying to find an answer to life or confidence in him or herself to read this book. I am glad I had the opportunity to have read The Alchemist and I now know to listen to my heart in times of trouble.  <br />

B0008JFMEC|3.0|I agree about the price.  I'm going to have to think twice about paying over $20 for a UMD - and I'm unlikely to buy it if I already have the DVD version.  I'm either going to buy one or the other.  I think the sweet spot is $14.99.  I supposed if I just bought the DVD and made a 'copy' for the PSP that would probably work better for me overall.<br /><br />Hopefully SONY will price them decently and not let greed overcome them.  I have bought House of Flying Daggers and Hellboy at Software etc. and pre-ordered National Treasure and Hero from Amazon so I'll have four already.  We'll see how this plays out...
0694524441|5.0|The Alchemist is about a boy named Santiago who follows his dream and destiny. Santiago gave up everything he owns and became a shepherd to travel all over the beautiful country with his sheep. He has a strange dream about a hidden treasure at an Egyptian pyramid so he decides to go there though it is far away. He is having a hard time making a decision about his destiny. But there are many people to help and make him realize his own destiny and how it is really important. Santiago's journey with many different individuals teaches him about life and what he really needs to know about the \\"Soul of the World.\\" This is time he can succeed in his dream, but if he misses it, he won't be able to succeed in his dream ever again.  <br /> When I started this book, I was expecting something really dynamic. The reason that I thought this story would be dynamic was because of the title. The alchemist makes gold and does really interesting things. However, this book only talked about a boy named Santiago, who is just traveling to find his treasure and to realize and follow his destiny. I was a little disappointed that the story about alchemist was so minor. However, I finally realized about the book's deeper meaning which is about the people who are afraid to suffer in order to follow their dreams. We should listen to our hearts, what we really want to do for our lives, what we really want to do for our future. During Santiago's journey I started thinking about my own dreams. Do I have confidence in my dream that can follow it for rest of my life, or is there something that I really wish to do but am afraid to try? <br /> I recommend this book to everybody except those who really like action stories. This book is telling us to think about our dreams that will affect our whole future. If you give up your dream, you are giving up everything you had. Just listen to your heart and hear what is best for you and find out what was your real dream for this whole life. <br />

B00003CXB4|1.0|I may be the only person on the planet with this opinion, but I did not like the message of this movie. The story is paternalistic in the extreme, displaying an overt and highly conservative agenda. I couldn't believe it. The Lions are a dictatorship supported by the animals in the jungle with a Nazi-ish zeal. A male child is born and seen as a savior? Where's the mom in all this? Where are the females at all except to giggle and bat their eyes, and to create male heirs?
B000084T18|1.0|Rappers have no talent what so ever. Why can't any of you people see that? And no im not one of those stupid kids who listens to death metal like all this modern music (...). <br /> <br />Real music is Rock from the 70's and late 60's.Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin really found the point of music. And no this isnt a racial thing, Jimi Hendrix is black, and hes one of my favortie musicians. Not to mention he was a hippy, and one of the greatest guitarist of all time. <br /> <br />My theory is this whole rap phase will end just like in the 80's with Hair Metal and 60's with the Psychedelic era. Each phase started its own culture, excatly like rap, and died within 5-9 years. Rap will be dead soon, and classic rock will return,  <br />                             FOR GOOD!
B00004YYDI|1.0|This movie sucks .. The professional is the most unprofessional hitman ever ... the girl is one damn precocious teenager ...the idea of a hitman teaching a frail kid to be like him is laughable .. and the way leon fights hundreds of policemen at the end and picks off 6 guys at the beginning show him as some supernatural killer ! The way Leon gets into the police HQ and shoots around is ridiculous ..I thought such stuff was only NEO's ( as in the MATRIX) preserve. The only redeeming aspects are the last shootout in the hotel and the villain when he pops his pill and cranes his neck .. man that is creepy. Even his character is almost reduced to a buffon when he starts talking rubbish about Beethoven and Mozart. <br />In other words , STAY AWAY from this lousy movie. Spend the evening watching any Chow Yun Fat movie instead.

I have not read such a great manuscript since Dale Carnegies, \\" How to win friends and influence people.\\" In I'd say this book is even better it's not just about business it's about life. <br /> <br />Do the right thing, just buy it and go for it! The book takes you through logical steps in starting up a new business, charity or not for profit organisation by firstly detailing the ground work necessary to do first whilst explaining why things are important, this book does not preach to you on terms of do this then do that, it talks to you like a friend would giving genuine advice. <br /> <br />It's obvious when reading that Guy's teaching is born from real life experience. Only when the fundamental \\"why\\" is explained in detail does Guy explain the \\"when\\" and \\"how\\" - like I say a true masterpiece. <br /> <br />The titan endorsements say it all too, Michael Moritz and Steve Jobs to name just two. <br /> <br /> I'm sure time will prove that Art of the Start becomes a classic as it provides the blue print on how to make your dreams a reality by giving practical (& I mean practical grass roots) advice on how to get things done! <br /> <br />If you have a dream and the desire to see it come true, if you want to start anything, a business, a not for profit, a charity and you have a desire to change the world, read this book. It will give you the tools and real world guidance you been looking for. <br /> <br />If you read this review Guy, I have three words for you. \\"Thank you friend\\" <br /> <br />ENDS
B00005JNQQ|5.0|And almost completely free of trite moralizing, this is one funny, exciting and visually stunning little movie. The story is deceptively simple: the young robot Rodney Copperbottom goes off to the big city to make his fortune as an inventor. However, he discovers that the object of his quest, Big Weld Industries, has been taken over by a corporate mama's boy who wants for force expensive upgrades on all the denizes of Robot City. Since spare parts are no longer being manufactured, all of the cobbled together robots will be allowed to fall to pieces which just so happens support's the Evil Momma's smelting factory! Rodney had been taught: \\"if you see a need, fill it!\\" which gets the story rolling to its happy conclusion.<br /><br />Fender, Rodney's side kick is played by Robin Williams, who is in fine form. Ewan McGregor is OK as Rodney, and the rest of the cast supports this gleeful madness with aplomb. My 5 year old was literally on the edge of his seat for the whole thing (as opposed to The Incredibles, where he was bored at the talky bits and wanted to go home) and my 12 year old loved the little smatterings of naughtiness (farting, urinating jokes). I love the Robin Williams verbal riffs, as did my husband. Fun for all!

Now theres Syd, the original main man, and heres Roger, our new main man. See how i like BOTH?!? <br /> <br /> Pink Floyd are a truly amazing band. Each one of there albums sound almost nothing like the one they did before that.....example----compare Wish you were here with Animals, or Meddle to Atom Heart mother.  ALL OF THEM are insanely awsome. I dont make any controversy over...oh this is Roger...or ohh this is all Gilmour!

B0007WZUMO|3.0|OK - this album is mostly what you'd expect from NIN/Trent Reznor - it has lots of harsh industrial rhythms, searing synths, overdriven guitar riffs, pain-inducing vocals, and generally lots of sonic assaults that will resonate with you if you are feeling very angry or alienated - and will give you a headache if you felt peaceful before the album came on.  But then Trent has a few flashes of melodic, wistful soundscapes woven into tracks like the opener and then yields the best NIN song to date with \\"Right Where I Belong,\\" which has a minimalist feel with very thoughtful lyrics and a haunting melody, which makes the album worth a few stars.  This album should please NIN fans, as it covers much of the same musical ground as previous efforts.  I find the industrial-metal sound that has dominated NIN later albums to be pretty repetitive, unoriginal, and hard to listen to for long.  Thus, I mainly give a satisfactory review for this album due to the one song that made hearing this album worthwhile for me.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have been a Mariah fan since about 1993....I have loved every album she has released since then (with the exception of the Glitter soundtrack)--but I have to say, this is probably her best album since 1997's Butterfly.  Her voice has not sounded this hot in ages and I happen to be very pleased that \\"the voice\\" has returned.  The album starts off with the track that totally hit me of guard upon hearing it for the first time \\"It's Like That\\"--it's not exactly your typical Mariah track---which makes it that much hotter.  In my honest opinion, the gem of the album, is the second track--\\"We Belong Together\\"  In this track, Mariah is using her vocal abilities 110%..she sounds as hot and fresh as she did on 1995's \\"Daydream\\" album.  This album does contain some collaborations with rappers (Snoop, JD, Nelly, Twista)...not something that I mind, but I know some people prefer Mariah's R&B flavor...more so than her hip hop side, but honestly, the rappers do not eclipse Mariah's talents, as I felt happened on the Glitter album.  I really do enjoy this album, and I feel like mariah really put some hard work into this album, and I would definitely recommend anyone who is a fan of the \\"Daydream\\", \\"Butterfly\\" album BUY THIS ALBUM!!!! It is really good!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|What a project.  If you look back in the 90s, you will see the music industry trying to catch on to as many trends and styles as possible.<br /><br />There was Ska, there was Swing, there was Latin Pop and other World Music.  And due to several factors (Enya's popularity, Clannad's TV clip causing a riot of people to find that song from the VW commerical, the Titanic's soundtrack which featured Irish Music, and of course Riverdance) Celtic Music became the next trend.<br /><br />But when the new century came, the industry had moved on.  Pity.<br /><br />Until now that is.........  David Downes should be congratulated for bringing about this event. He has done it, again!  Also kudos go the angels who performed on this disc: Lisa, Meav, Orla, Chloe, and Mairead.<br /><br />Honestly, this CD had to grow on me, as I didn't get to see the special on TV.  Eventually I began to really enjoy this disc.  Standout tracks for me:<br /><br />\\"Last Rose of Summer/Walking in the Air\\" sounds like an angel lost in a cathedral.  Just gorgeous!  Lilting and atmospheric.  A new Charlotte Church is found!<br /><br />\\"May it Be\\" is sung slightly different from Enya.  Where Enya sings with high airy delicateness.  This is sung with strength tempered with softness.  Very beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Siuil a Run (Walk My Love)\\" is an old song.  It is sung from the point of view of a woman whose love has gone to war.  Her voice is sad and beautiful at the same time.  Some of the men from the Irish Brigade had gone to fight in France, around the 17th century.  They were known as the Wild Geese, and sadly, they never came home.  The only other version of this song that measures up is by Clannad, on their album DULAMAN.<br /><br />\\"Orinoco Flow\\" is of course another Enya song.  A march of music set to words about wind currents and exotic places.  I laughed at this version on CELTIC WOMAN... at first.  Only because the choir of voices singing the chorus surpirsed me.  This has grown on me, and I love it now.<br /><br />\\"Harry's Game\\" is a Clannad track.  A gaelic proverb dedicated to the strife of mankind, and the conflict of Northern Ireland.  This version is sung without harmonies and the single voice is plaintive and poetic.  A wonderful cover.<br /><br />\\"Nella Fantasia\\", \\"Danny Boy\\" and \\"Ave Maria\\" all sound beautiful in this Irish setting of voices.<br /><br />In conclusion, CELTIC WOMAN explores the mysterious quality that is found in the lost legends of the emerald isle and the atmospheric voices of the Wild Irish Goddesses.  Enjoy!me, and I love it now. <br /> <br />\\"Harry's Game\\" is a Clannad track.  A gaelic proverb dedicated to the strife of mankind, and the conflict of Northern Ireland.

B000002IOJ|5.0|This album kept me sane 15 years ago as I attended High School. I spent an entire year with this tape stuck in my walkman. As I listen to it now, I'm still in awe of its power.  <br /> <br />At Thrash Metal's peak, when bands moved past the fastest-riff-ever and gothic tones to more meaningful topics and much more mature music, PWYP stands out in a small cluster of releases by an even smaller cluster of artists that to me, truly defined the power of the music and the message it could convey. I miss those days.
B00003CX9E|2.0|I kind of agree with all negative reviews about Citizen Kane. However, it is not the worst film ever made like many people say. It may not be a good film but I give credits for the attempts they try to make this boring film look like a masterpiece. It fails in every aspect.
B00000JG41|5.0|\\"California\\" is a stunning record-- breezy, harmony laden, off kilter music, embracing and disgarding dozens of genres.  In many ways, it also for me appears to be the most heavily influenced by Mike Patton.  His penchant for theatrical and somewhat overblown (not necessarily a bad thing) comes out pretty heavily in this one.  Mind you, I approach this from a drastically different standpoint than many others-- I came to Patton from John Zorn and am a huge Beach Boys fan, and in many ways, this sort of sounds like the two of them were the peak influences.  Take \\"Air-Conditioned Nightmare\\", with its syncopated, vocal driven rhythms, bringing up and disgarding genres with an ease that only John Zorn seems to manage well. <br /> <br />Overall, the album feels like a psychotic lounge record-- its a number of ballad forms that dominate the record, but they're all really engaging and worth repeated listens-- check out \\"Sweet Charity\\", the brilliant \\"Retrovertigo\\" (if Patton's singing at the chorus doesn't stop you in your tracks, I don't know what will), or \\"Pink Cigarette\\".  Mind you, the emphasis on ballads shouldn't distract from other great song fomrs, the album dives into the totally bizarre on pieces like \\"None of Them Knew They Were Robots\\" and \\"Golem II: The Bionic Vapour Boy\\", maintaining a stunning level of quality. <br /> <br />As if this wasn't enough, the Brian Wilson influence exerts in the production too-- the album has that same sort of Phil Spector/Brian Wilson lush wall-of-sound genius production vibe that you really don't get anymore. <br /> <br />In the end, the record is brilliant, start to finish.  Its a shame we'll probably never see anything else from this ensemble (details are sketchy, but my guess is that Patton and Spruance are unwilling or unable to reach anything resembling common ground on either a personal or musical level anymore).  Highly recommended.
B00005TT77|1.0|This is piece of filth.  Beatles songs should not EVER be covered--especially by this untalented menagerie of \\"performers.\\"  The ghoul who sanctioned this album should be tracked down and psychologically evaluated (and imprisoned with a life sentence).  I would never wish the trauma associated with listening to this garbage on my worst enemies.  The songs are butchered beyond belief and some are almost unrecognizable.  I shouldn't have expected any better based on the quality of the film and cast.  Any true Beatles fan will be horrified by how badly these treasured songs were brutally maimed.  I honestly get nauseous when seeing the track listing.  I have never even heard of most of these singers (for good reason, obviously).  So please do EVERYONE a favor and buy the original Beatles albums if you want to hear the songs the way they were meant to be heard.
B0006957SA|5.0|This album was first shown to me by my high school band teacher, and thank god he did.  He opened my eyes to a totally cool band with probably one of the most revolutionary sounds to ever hit the earth.  Traditional sounds with pounding energy and extremely poetic lyrics, MacGowan and the rest of the Pogues deliver a sensational album.  I just warn about not playing it in front of little kids, as some of the songs are a little suggestive for their age group.  But all that aside, this album is one that shines above many and joins the rank of \\"CD that never leaves the player.\\"
B00006JJ51|5.0|\\"Straight Outta Compton\\" created a revolution in gangsta rap; influencing countless acts to follow in their footsteps. It's a common misconception to think that this was the first gangsta rap album ever. The album was originally released in 1988. Shocking narratives of ghetto street life were in full effect at this time, originally brought forth by Ice-T, and Schoolly D in 1987. But \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" is arguably the best when it comes down to history in the making. The stories held within are frightening, and riveting; thought provoking and unapologetic. Main members, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube (founder), MC Ren and Eazy-E, paint a vivid picture of L.A.'s rough and tough Compton ghetto. You really feel the empathy of the life that they live through their brutally honest delivery of pain, anger and the need to be heard. The lyrical content provides powerful images of poverty, guns, violence, police, bi***es and the overall mindset of living in the ghetto.<br /><br />The record sounds insanely fresh and perfect; which is quite a feat, since production value in hip-hop has come a long way since 1988. The beats sound funky, innovative and most importantly, they serve as a winning template for their engrossing lyrical flows. Although you wouldn't know it by the tones in their voices, their is a fair amount of comic relief to balance out the record. A lot of these same things can be said about other classic gangsta rap albums, but this one clearly broke the mold, reaching kids in the middle of suburbia. There is a large amount of shock value involved, especially for pre-teen white kids. If only on tape or CD, this album was the introduction of these frightening concepts to many of these kids. From beginning to end, these guys show you just where they come from, right down to the philosophy of every day life. There would be several wannabe MCs to follow, but none of them possessed a fraction of the skill held by the likes of Ice-T or N.W.A. In fact, this record runs a lot like the early hardcore rap style of Public Enemy (without their message). Ice Cube left the group in late 1989 to pursue his solo career. Dr. Dre left the group in 1992, after their last album \\"Niggaz4life\\", to pursue his soon to be legendary solo career, and record label, Death Row Records.<br /><br />If you listen to rap music, you were in some way influenced by this album. \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" may be their seminal work from the late 1980s; but the presence of N.W.A. was captured throughout the 90s; since Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, Eazy-E, and The D.O.C. all had successful solo careers, based on of the success of this stunning masterpiece. Comparatively, they're a lot like the Beatles, as far as rap music is concerned. \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" is a raw, beautifully crafted, unprecedented masterpiece.

0375751513|4.0|Back in a world where vanity is a good trait to have and beauty is worshipped. This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.<br /><br /> Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.<br /><br /> Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.<br /><br />  With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.<br /><br /> Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot. Broaden your mind and reflect on your morality. It is time to rediscover your path.ough there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot.

B000001EHS|5.0|It seems that fter going through a long phase where I listened to soft rock and adult contemporary (ie, Barry Manilow and The Carpenters), I have finally fallen back into the hard rock that once dominated my record collection. In the last few months, I've purchased cds by Aeromsith, Heart, Kiss, Billy Idol and Van Halen (though I love the soft rock stuff just as much).<br /><br />Def Leppard's \\"Vault - Greatest Hits\\" is the latest cd in my hard rock spree. Def Leppard is without a doubt one of the quintessential hard rock bands. From their volatile looks to their thrilling songs through brilliant instrumental skills (including a drummer who could play with only one arm), they had it all.<br /><br />\\"Vault\\" is a 15 - track cd that collects all of Def Lep's biggest songs, which include the rock standard \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\", the eerie ballad \\"Love Bites\\", the turbo charged \\"Armageddon It\\" and \\"Let's Get Rocked\\", the tender \\"Two Steps Behind\\" and the rock radio staples \\"Photograph\\", \\"Rock Of Ages\\" (I love that gibberish line before the intro), \\"Animal\\" and \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\". All these songs are true rock classics, along with the others I haven't mentioned. Especially great is the power ballad \\"When Love And Hate Collide\\", the new single from the album when it was released in 1995.<br /><br />Bottom line: this cd is essential for any fan of classic rock or any type of music for that matter. If you don't like it than, in this reviewer's opinion, you have no taste in music.
B0007P3582|5.0|OM3.... Wizzup??? Why y'all hate on mah dog 50? He is a TR00 Musician & rapper!!!! Best album of all time!!! I now like him more than Chizzingy since mah dog from da east coast 50 now gets SUPUH HATE!!!!!!!!!!!! I got to kiss his d**k once :). Man he is fizzine!!!!!!! Candy Shop is the Best... Best... BEST song to exist!
B00004ZD69|5.0|This cd is without a doubt the first musical masterpiece to grace the 21st century.  Each song is between 15-25 minutes long, and although to some people that may seem a bit excessive, listen to this cd and you will see why the length is required.  I do not recommend this cd for anyone with a closed mind, for it is nothing like most of the popular music available today.  If you are completely closed off to everything except one genre of music, or you believe one band to be completely superior to all others, this may not be your cd.  But if you truly love music for the beautiful, expressive art form it is, then i highly recommend this emotional experience captured in cd form. <br /> <br />The first cd has two songs on it: <br />1. Storm  (8/10):  this is a very slow starting song, yet it builds up to be almost triumphant by the end.  it is a wonderful way to start everything off. <br />2. Static (10/10):  a totally amazing burst of energy!  it starts out very slow and melodic, and then gives a weird creepy tone with the words of a preacher, but it keeps building and building into a massive angry explosion.  Truly a masterpiece! <br /> <br />The second cd also has two songs on it: <br />1. Sleep (15/10!!!):  without a doubt the most moving Godspeed song to date!  it starts off with Murray Ostril talking about his experiences on Coney Island, and then the violins pull this song into almost a dream-like state.  tragedy strikes about halfway through the song, and it ends off with an absolutely beaufitul violin solo.  A complete stroke of musical genius! <br />2. Antennaes to Heaven (8/10)- after Sleep, there is no good way to ever end any cd.  that song is absolutely amazing, and this one doesn't do it justice for the end.  although it is beautiful in it's own aspects, it doesn't compare.
B0000029AP|2.0|Aerossszzzmmmiittthh r just as bizzad as Van Gayf*glen (with DLG & SG). Luckily tey became better wit 9 Lives & the mizzasterpiece Just Push Plizzay. Avoid they 70s & 80s (...) at all cizosts though!!!!! I bet you'll hate it as well, dude!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is my favorite. It works as an entire piece or song by song. As weird as Yorke's voice might seem at first, it's just a powerful combination of the right sounds that create a unique experience.
B00007BK2N|2.0|24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way.  <br /> <br />My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste.  <br /> <br />Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into.
B0000057C5|5.0|Rammstein have become legends in their own field, creating music that's not industrial, or metal, yet a cross-breed of both. If you like heavy, head-bobbing music, you'll like Sehnsucht, and basically any other Rammstein album. Don't be turned away by the german vocals. They are what makes Rammstein, who they are, and translations are available if you look for them...
B00004TL21|5.0|Hell yes! This album finally sees Deftones reaching damn near sonic perfection! I liked Adrenaline, I VERY much enjoyed Around the Fur, and I LOVE this album. This album is filled to the brim with everything I love about this band! \\"Feiticiera\\" is brilliant...did you notice how the song has no chorus, but it flows so well, you don't even realize it at first?? This is a very easy album to get totally lost in. Chino's voice sounds better than it ever sounded before, the guitars grind, blister and blugeon the ears, while trippy synth washes and strange soundscapes interweave themselves into the songs, the bass is deep and rich and the whole album has a very subtle and hypnotic intensity to it. Although it's considerably less in-your-face than Adrenaline and Around the Fur, I think White Pony is in some ways, even heavier than those albums. The guitars here are about as sludgey and razor-sharp as they always were, but in terms of mood and atmosphere, this is one hell of a heavy, heavy album. I remember when I bought this album...it was at the beach one summer. I went out and bought this and came back to relax in the sun and listen to it. It was a GREAT experience...This is perfect blasting VERY loud on lazy hot summer days. Just let it play and don't worry about skipping any tracks...they're all good. Actually \\"Elite\\" is the only track I get a bit tired of sometimes, but it's still a good song. If you get one Deftones album, get this one. It's filled with more great, smart musical ideas than most alternative metal bands have EVER thought of in their entire careers.
B00065MDRW|5.0|In the Court of the Crimson King is one of the greatest debuts of all time, especially for a prog band. Tremendously inventive, sporting ethereal mellotron, evocative lyrics (courtesy of Pete Sinfield), and everything from freakish, heavy jazz-rock (21st Century Schizoid Man), to one of the eeriest love songs ever (Moonchild). Sure, it's pretty hard to be unimpressed with In the Court of the Crimson King, but that doesn't mean it's an easy album to like. First things first, if you don't like progressive rock, don't even consider this album. In fact, if you're beginning to explore progressive rock, pick up Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Brain Salad Surgery, or Yes' Fragile before diving into King Crimson. This band is not for the faint of heart. Buy this album, but don't be ready with comparisons to other prog bands - King Crimson was one of the first, and certainly one of the most original. 21st Century Schizoid Man leads things off with a heavy metal styled introduction before morphing into strange, rapid-moving jazz-rock. I Talk to the Wind is another great song, led by flute and Greg Lake's amazing vocals. Epitaph is about as dramatic as things get, as we return to the classic Crimson sound. Moonchild is the only problem - the first two or three minutes are great (and incidentally, very disconcerting), but the rest is aimless jamming that is only barely listenable. It saps the album of all its momentum. Thankfully, the closer title track is the finest thing on the album, and remedies that mistake.
0783225849|5.0|There are no words to describe how excellent this film is. Im 22 years old and this was my first time ever viewing this film. I saw the sequals before the original. Ive seen almost every other horror film out there and loved Pyscho 2. Wasnt that impressed with 3 but I eventually saw Pyscho and I am blown away. Any fan of psychological horror should see this. It is truly one of the greats and Hitchcock is an amazing director. This has to be in the top 3 best horror movies ever, if not the best. Story is about a young man named Norman Bates. He runs the Bates Motel. A woman named Marian Crane happens to run into him while trying to find a place to stay for the night after stealing 40,000 dollars. Wont tell you what happens from there but the film just keeps getting better and better till the great ending. Amazing performances by all. Anthony Perkins gives one of the most memorable performances in film history. Also contains a theatrical trailer with Hitch giving the audience a guided tour through the bates house/motel. Collector's Edition has The making of Pyscho original documentary, Interviews with Hitchcock's daughter and more.- Censored scenes, production drawings, unforgettable shower scene with and without music, news footage and production photographs. Highly Recomended. One of the greats! Enjoy.
B0007CNXUK|1.0|This movie is excruciatingly slow-moving. The pacing is glacial and not much happens...Even diehard anglophiles will do well to stay away from this stinker.
B0007GAERG|5.0|As I sit typing this I begin to think about how an artist can ever outdo a certain album. Take note: Prince never could capture the essence of \\"Purple Rain\\" again nor Michael Jackson could ever outdo his flawless \\"Thriller\\". Mariah Carey has had many albums (this is her tenth) and when we Mariah Carey fans look back at her catalog of music she scored not only with her debut but with 1997's \\"Butterfly\\". \\"Butterfly\\" was the album to end all Mariah albums... hence the word WAS. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" has surpassed everything that Mariah has EVER done. The title is a little childish, yes, but taken from a nickname it just seems that Mariah is trying to hard to pull a Madonna (remember, she wants to be called Esther?). But after listening to the album, the nickname has some heavy meaning. Mariah has finally, though she has said many times, has freed herself. On this new effort, Mariah has done the album of a lifetime. The hip-hop/R&B tunes with countless guest rappers are not ghetto fab, the ballads not the familliar run of the mill high note extravaganzas, the songs on here are controlled, simple but have a way of being so good that oversinging (or overrapping) is not the case. Mariah takes control of her instrument and uses it with class, she never splits the ear and she never throws down that \\"Hero\\"-esque vocal but she still sends chills up the spine. Even the guest rappers (Snoop Dogg, Nelly, Jermaine Dupri and Twista) don't get too \\"crunk\\", they are just as controlled as Mariah and come off as some very fine lyricists.  <br />\\"Emancipated\\" starts off with the infectious first single, \\"It's Like That\\" which has a great little beat, funky flute and a piano driven bridge. The lyrics are funny and clever like \\"Those chickens is ash and I'm lotion\\" and \\"I'm feeling so hot tamale\\". You sing it girl! The slow tempo groove of \\"We Belong Together\\" is up next talking of a failed relationship and how Mariah wants to rekindle the flame. Nice singing and very nice arrangement. \\"Shake It Off\\" is funky and upbeat and oddly, to me, sounds like another Jermanie Dupri produced track \\"Confessions\\" by Usher...still the song holds its own. I like the way Mariah sings in this one and some more clever and cute lyrics like \\"So I packed up my Louis Vutton, jumped in ride and took off\\" Oooh, drama! The big band backing of ballad \\"Mine Again\\" turns this song into a 70's love groove song, I like the whole horn arrangement plus Mariah sings outstandingly. Okay, my favorite song has got to be \\"Say Somethin'\\" which is produced by the wonder kids, The Neptunes (Man, there good!) and reunites Mariah with Snoop Dogg. The song is techno influenced with electronic keyboard sounds and hard hitting drum machine. I love everything about the song, the lyrics, the beat... just great! My new favorite rapper, Kayne West helps Mariah with the slow jam, \\"Stay The Night\\" which features beautiful vocals from Mariah and a great backing of piano man Ramsey Lewis's remake of \\"Betch By Golly Wow\\", another winner. JD produced \\"Get Your Number\\" samples from the theme song to the 1986 hit movie FX called \\"Just An Illusion\\" by a group called Imagine (Loved the original song-whatever happened to them? lol). The song is mega hot with JD singing the chorus and has a great club beat to it, should be another hit for Mariah. \\"Circles\\" is up next, another 70's ballad type song that has great backing keyboard and vocal gymnastics from Mariah while \\"Your Girl\\" has cute girly lyrics to it and \\"I Wish You Knew\\" features Mariah doing some controlled and light notes. The Neptunes and Mariah churn out another great collabo, this time with Nelly on \\"To The Floor\\" which will literally get you groovin' \\"to the floor\\". Love the vocal arrangements and the chorus. \\"Joy Ride\\" is a slow-tempo jam that has Mariah yet again using her instrument and this song she hits those impossible high notes. Nice little ballad. Then the ballad to end all of Mariah's ballads (Sorry, \\"Vision Of Love\\" and \\"Hero\\") \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" is just simply GORGEOUS!!! I mean, it starts off slow then picks up into this wild gospel frenzy that is so timeless! You've got to hear it for yourself. It sent chills up my spine! I practically stood up and applauded after this song went off. Very inspirational and outstanding. Worth one star alone! Mariah is flawless on this! <br />\\"Emancipation\\" is Mariah's best if not best ever, she is simply flawless on this, not oversinging ANYTHING and maintaining some tight beats and funky rhymes. The whole album is nothing but a journey of good music, I did not skip anything and I always put it on repeat. EVERY song on here is excellent! And that's hard to find with albums these days. This album makes every other Mariah album (excluding her debut and \\"Butterfly\\") take a step back and it shows that Mariah is going on a whole new level with her work. I hope she continues down this route, but I'm not sure if she can recapture this but we'll see! Emancipated Indeed!  <br /> <br />Though the whole album is just phenomenal, I have my top 5 and it was hard to choose! (I excluded \\"It's Like That\\" because its already a hit and everybody has heard it) <br /> <br />StarSprinkles Top 5 <br />1. Fly Like A Bird <br />2. Say Somethin' (feat. Snoop Dogg) <br />3. Get Your Number (feat. JD) <br />4. We Belong Together <br />5. Shake It Off (tie/ \\"Mine Again\\")
B000002KHH|5.0|Before I get to this album. Bozo and the Bandwagon of Poop, how dare you call Black Sabbath frauds. Man if you think Korn started metal in 1994, you are seriously on crack. Sabbath started the whole metal thing back in the late 60's. GET A LIFE MOTHERF**KER! Go back and listen to your crappy nu metal cds, and let us listen to what we want dumbass.<br /><br />Now onto the album. Black Sabbath's Paranoid is a metal landmark, and it's their all time best album along with Master of Reality. The best three songs on here being, War Pigs, Paranoid, and of course Iron Man are without a shadow of a doubt metal classics, and they all have some of the most memorable guitar riffs ever. If you're getting into the legacy that is Black Sabbath, Paranoid is a great place to start along with Master Of Reality. Get this landmark classic now. DEATH TO FALSE METAL! HAIL BLACK SABBATH!<br /><br />Now here's the rating for the songs<br /><br />1. War Pigs/Luke's Wall: 5/5<br /><br />2. Paranoid: 5/5<br /><br />3. Planet Caravan: 4/5(Not as good as the Pantera version, but still good)<br /><br />4. Iron Man: 5/5<br /><br />5. Electric Funeral: 5/5<br /><br />6. Hand Of Doom: 5/5<br /><br />7. Rat Salad: 5/5<br /><br />8. Jack The Stripper/Fairies Wear Boots: 5/5
B00001OH7N|5.0|Overall, this album has a much more \\"classic\\" blues-based, folk rock sound than any of David Bowie's other material. It's not too far off from the kind of music typically heard on classic rock radio. But thanks to Bowie's phenomenal creativity (not to mention the fantastic band - basically a proto-Spiders from Mars) the music often reaches far beyond this \\"classic\\" style, the bedrock for most of these songs. Sometimes it's quasi-psychedelic, sometimes it's just straight-up rock and sometimes it's altogether unclassifiable.<br /><br />Each song features meltdown guitar playing from Mick Ronson. The lyrics aren't really that deep but they're quite entertaining and sometimes pretty thought provoking none-the-less. My favorite track - the soaring case for insanity \\"All the Madmen.\\" Least favorite - \\"The Supermen\\" with those \\"George of the Jungle\\" drums.<br /><br />For a rock n' roller, Bowie had real vision. Not only that, he had the courage to pursue his vision. Bowie was very good at manipulating his image and one could say his decision to wear a dress on the cover was calculated to shock (something he loved to do). But he also did what he wanted and seemed to genuinely like wearing dresses. Consider this quote from 1971: \\"I went to America to promote THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD and, as I was going to Texas, I wore a dress. One guy pulled out a gun and called me a (...). But I thought the dress was beautiful.\\" On the other hand: \\"I was always sort of a throwback to the Beat period in my early thinking, and when the hippies came along with all their funny tie-dyes and things, it seemed naive and wrong. It didn't have a backbone. I hate weak things. I wanted to hit everyone that came along wearing love beads.\\" (1976)<br /><br />Not to brag or anything, but I must say I'm quite happy with my RYKODISK remaster. It's worth seeking out for the excellent bonus material, especially the supercool \\"Holy, Holy\\" single.
B000002KE2|5.0|I know alot of people will prefer Paranoid or Master Of Reality as Black Sabbath's best albums, and that's okay, they're both great albums, but Vol.4 is in my opinion Sabbath's very best album. This album has some of the band's most catchiest songs ever including the awesome addictive 8 minute opener Wheels Of Confusion which shows some of guitarist Tony Iommi's catchiest riffs ever, and of course lead singer Ozzy Osbourne gives out one of his best performances on here. Other great songs include Tomorrow's Dream, Changes, Snowblind, Supernaut, Cornucopia, and of course the beautiful instrumental Laguna Sunrise.

0688170528|4.0|\\"The Pact\\" is a fine novel from writer Jodi Picoult.  Ms. Picoult tends to favor controversial subjects and courtroom scenes.  Don't expect another John Grisham.  Her writing is more character-driven and less legal drama.  Although \\"The Pact\\" is good, it's clear from Ms. Picoult's writing that she can do better. <br /> <br />Emily Gold and Christopher Harte have been neighbors all their lives and everyone, their parents included, expects them to eventually marry.  Until Christopher is discovered with a loaded gun and a dead Emily.  Was it a suicide pact and if so, why is Christopher still alive?   Was Emily suicidal and if she was, why? <br /> <br />The story follows Christopher and the two families as they deal with the loss and the resulting trial.  Flashbacks are used and even Emily's point of view explains missing elements.  <br /> <br />The novel can be awkward.  Using Emily's viewpoint seems the easy way to explain her reasoning and interrupts the story.  Also, the question of sexual abuse is handled clumsily and should have been developed better or deleted.   <br /> <br />I recommend reading \\"The Pact.\\"  Ms. Picoult is a superior writer and I have yet to read a book from her that I wouldn't read again.
0345446798|4.0|Its like a dog/human version of \\"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\\". The book cites a lot of research into the behavior of canids and primates and helps to bridge the differences in thinking. There are practicals throughout the book, although it isn't a step by step training guide. I have to agree with another reviewer who indicated that it is a bit too politically correct. The author teaches against physical punishment. Admittedly, I'm not a professional dog trainer, but its hard for me to imagine training a rambunctious young dog without an occasional, non-abusive slap on the rear. Overall, a very interesting and informative book which made a positive difference for me and my dog.
B0000C0FJB|2.0|I'm deaf in one ear so at first I thought it was just something people could hear in Stereo that I could not, until my all-ears friend listened to it, and said it sounded like a horrible bootleg someone attempted with one of those old tape players you buy at Radio shack. <br /> <br />It was just horrible, too much base, I tried to lower the base, change the treble, play with the EQ, no luck, still crappy god awful sound.  The first poster was spot on the money, I'm just re-affirming that this is by far the worst Rush live album I've ever heard.   <br /> <br />I'm sadly disappointed with Rush on this, they were the ones that signed off on this project, if a partially deaf guy can point out how awful the sound is, I have to ask, did Rush even LISTEN to this album?   <br /> <br />Okay to be fair here, what's good about the album.. the art work is pretty, the set list is arranged well, the CD's are nice and round with no jagged edges, other than that there are far better live albums out there.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I'm not really a Madonna fan, but decided to give this cd a listen, now that the negative hype has died down. Needless to say, I was really impressed. \\"American Life\\" is a great, catchy tune that is ruined by a rap at the end. I'm not sure if Madonna was trying to be ironic, but it just doesn't work. The next track, Hollywood, is her most catchy track in years. The best song on this album is \\"Nothing Fails,\\" an amazing gospel song that even blows \\"Like a Prayer\\" away. It's sometimes weird to hear Madonna singing about \\"Jesus Christ,\\" but she does it wonderfully on \\"X-Static Process.\\" People really  need to listen to this cd before they judge it as the \\"low point\\" of Madonna's career.
0618526412|3.0|I found the storyline too meandering with not enough substance. It was not a gripping page turner. The characters were oddballs and not terribly interesting oddballs at that. I'm very surprised this was one of Oprah's picks. It was definitely one of the more tedious choices from Oprah's list. <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|1.0|How desperate does a fading diva become when she has to pay Fox News to hype this album. If you don't believe me, talk to someone who works at Fox news. People are fuming over there about it and the fact that their \\"entertainment reporter\\" still has a job. Ok..the album..completely disgusting. How does a diva with the greatest voice in musical History turn into an   R&B (...) who sings like a dying elephant? \\"It's Like that,\\" the first flop single, is the most desperate thing any aging diva has ever done. \\"To The Floor\\" is the only good song on the album. Unfortunately, Mariah has to pimp Nelly for this one. She pimps a different rapper on every different song. Poor woman!
0440237688|4.0|Beginning this book as a class assignment, reading a huge success was not one of my expectations. I envisioned a boring, hard to understand and relate to book. I got the extreme opposite. I discovered Jonas, a twelve year old boy living in a world where sameness was the game. Imperfection was disposed of and impractical things vanquished. Jonas' journey in the book was one like no other. He fought everything he had believed in and all because of his \\"assignment\\" to be a reciever of memory. He recieved memories from times before sameness took place in the community. Memories of snow, and Christmas. As to his dismay, memories of pain. He realized through these memories that everything he knew was not realistic. It was all a plan. he was not an individual, but a robot living in a world of sameness.<br /><br />  Lois Lowry amazed me in this true story of faith and uniqueness. No book will ever compare to the story of \\"The Giver\\". So, bravo! Mrs. Lowry. You have created a masterpiece. I recommend this book for all ages. It is best for middle schoolers, but would be good for teens as well.

This is a great story that deserves four and a half stars of recognition.the reason for this high rating is it has non-stop action, suspense, mystery,and what am i leaving out ... oh yeah everything else you would find in the perfect book.i can find no reason all or even half a reason why Harry Potter or Lord of The Rings are more popular it is also  a mystery why i have not discovered this book sooner.Pullman is a unique author who to me is the best in his field since Mark Twain(who i highly recommend to anyone who can read)so please send your hate mail and death threats to VIXXER282 at yahoo.com
B00030590I|4.0|Action + Classic Narrative + Philosophy = a martial arts film with a brain.<br /><br />I picked up this film as a little light entertainment while lying on the couch recovering from an injury.  I was pleasantly surprized!  Yes, it has its share of typical martial arts action (i.e. people flying, walking on water, doing unbelievable stunts, etc.), but it is all tied together by a story line that makes sense and even causes the viewer to think afterward.  The film started a little slow, then quietly hooked me before I realized I was watching something with substance.  If it were not for the slow start I would invite friends over to see this film and discuss it.<br /><br />Now, for a tough question, is it better for a people to be bound together by even a bad government than for everyone to have the freedom to be a law unto themselves?  We see the question everywhere around us . . .<br /><br />1 Roman Catholic Church or 34,000 Protestant Churches?<br /><br />1 evil dictator or multiple warring tribes?<br /><br />Federal rights or States' rights?<br /><br />Should Taiwan and Hong Kong exist apart from China?<br /><br />Watch the film, then decide.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Like all instruments, playing the guitar is an art form. It takes a lot of time and patience to understand and learn. Many try, but few succeed. Those who do succeed have either learned from someone else, or they are simply born with \\"God-given talent.\\" \\"Dimebag\\" or \\"Diamond\\" (as he was known then) Darrell Abbott definitely mastered his art due to both of these.<br /><br /> Diamond Darrell and his brother, drummer Vinnie Paul formed a band while they were still in high school. These cowboys from Hell (or Texas, as they'd lead you to believe) were a cover band before anything else; until the early 1980's, when the Abbott brother's dad convinced them to start writing their own music. They formed a band, Pantera, that released their first album when Diamond was only 17. They continued releasing \\"hair/glam\\" metal albums until 1990.<br /><br />\\"Cowboys from Hell\\" is the group's major label debut (as well as their second album with vocalist Phil Anselmo and the last album before \\"Diamond\\" Darrell changed his nickname to \\"Dimebag.\\") Starting with this album, Pantera turbo-charged their sound, making their metal ten times heavier. Some believe they aborted their original sound (in favor of a more vengeful one), because they were signed to a major label. Others believe they did it because the `90's were a new era and hair metal was no longer popular. I, however, only partially believe both of these theses. I think Pantera aborted their `80's style of music because of the influence Diamond/Dimebag Darrell had on the band. In the early days, Dime was influenced by such artists as Ace Frehley of Kiss (thus explaining Pantera's hair metal sound), Eddie Van Halen, and Randy Rhodes. But as Pantera aged and released increasingly heavy albums, he cited influences among his contemporaries such as Kerry King of the extreme metal band Slayer.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, there's no disputing that Pantera changed its sound for the better. It's a good thing that \\"Cowboys from Hell\\" was Pantera's breakthrough album, because if one of their hair/glam metal albums had been a hit, Pantera probably would have been tempted to continue playing that kind of music, and hair metal isn't what Pantera was meant for. Phil Anselmo, Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul Abbott, and bassist Rex Brown were put on this earth to play heavy as f*ck heavy metal. It's like Phil says: \\"We had to decide where our musical hearts were. After short deliberation, we realized our intention was to be the most devastating 'hardcore-heavy metal' band in the world.\\"<br /><br />There is also no denying that Pantera were backed by one of the strongest rhythm sections in metal. Sure, Vinnie Paul's drumming and Phil's howling were both top notch, but Dimebag Darrell's unbelievably powerful, talented riffing and wonderful solos were the biggest reason why Pantera were the heavy, influential, famous, and all around great band that they were.<br /><br /> \\"Cowboys from Hell\\" has lightning fast, cascading riffs at the beginning and a winding guitar solo near the middle. Not much can be said about this song that hasn't already been said. It's an instant classic that defined Pantera.<br /> \\"Primal Concrete Sledge\\" is a short, sludgy song with lurching riffs.<br /> \\"Psycho Holiday\\" has more classic, thumping Pantera riffs and near the end, the guitar changes speeds and turns to a fast chug. The real highlight here though, is the 45 second-long, wailing guitar solo that has three parts to it. These solos would become renowned worldwide and a trademark of Dimebag. I've always really enjoyed how Dimebag could riff fast and hard, pause briefly to lay down a solo, then go back to the great riffs.<br /> \\"Cemetery Gates\\" is the semi-ballad of the album. Phil sings about his longing for a loved one who has passed away and, even though the song gains momentum and speed, the theme of this one is much slower than the other songs. It begins with light, spacey guitar notes, has a solo in the middle, and endswith really high-pitched falsetto screams, which are matched by high, harmonic guitars.<br /> After the album's semi-ballad, Pantera pick up where they left off with maybe the heaviest song on the album. \\"Domination\\" has guitars and drums that thud thunderously. The beginning is really fast, similar to another Pantera anthem, \\"F*cking Hostile,\\" with great back-and-forth work between the guitars and drums. It has another great solo near the end, and the song's last few seconds are slow chugging, booming riffs.<br />Machine gun riffs and drums occupy much of \\"Shattered\\", making the song so fast it almost sounds like it's vibrating. When Phil's vocals begin, he lays down some Judas Priest-esque screams that are so high, it almost sounds like he's squealing.<br />\\"The Sleep\\" begins slowly, with acoustic guitar licks. The song then turns to a galloping beat, with punching guitars and it's rounded off by not one, but TWO more superb solos.<br /><br />  Dimebag's virtuoso guitar work also makes \\"Cowboys from Hell,\\" like all landmark metal albums, stand the test of time. At the time, \\"CfH\\" was about as heavy as heavy metal got. 15 years later, it's nothing short of a classic. Like Metallica's \\"Kill `Em All\\" or Slayer's \\"Show No Mercy,\\" \\"Cowboys from Hell\\" is not the band's best offering. But, it's a great album that's essential for all metalheads. Plus, since this was Pantera's most thrashy-sounding album, it's essential for 1980's thrash fans, too. The bottom line is if you like heavy metal, you should be sinking your teeth into this album.<br /><br /> If you learn from the best, you'll be the best. He has Eddie Van Halen and Randy Rhodes to thank for it, but Dimebag was the best of his generation. Thus, as the best, it was his job to influence a new generation of guitarists. Even though Dimebag is now deceased, his legend lives on through younger, aspiring guitarists. There's only one Dimebag Darrell Lance Abbott, but there will surely be many more people coming our way who have mastered the art of guitar shredding...and they'll have Dimebag to thank., which are matched by high, harmonic guitars.

0060934913|1.0|As a former cook and restaurant worker, I thought it might be interesting to read about the experiences of someone who's still working in the field.  I've moved on to journalism, government, and the law, but I look back fondly on the energy, friendships, and fun of restaurant work.  Anthony Bourdain, however, gives a bad name to both writing and cooking. He is a boring story teller with a foul mouth. He is unrelentingly crude and hyperbolic.  He's such a swaggering show-off that it feels as if you can't trust a word he says. Although I got all the way through the book, I felt as if I needed a shower after reading this guy's ego-driven \\"confidences\\".  Do yourself a favor and don't even think about buying this book, written by a second-tier cook, a third-rate writer, and a fourth-rate mind.

I thought for sure this movie was going to go down as the best ancient era movie ever made. But its just another great movie that does not get the respect it deserves . With bad asses like brad pitt and erik bana in it and a great story line and good length who could say its a bad movie and its mostly the people that critisize it for being  off topic or not sticking to the real story . Well guess whats its holly wood what the hell do u expect this movie wasnt meant to be very true to the real story its just an amazing movie with a great story 2 back it up
6300214028|5.0|A particularly antagonized review cuts this film off, tauting it as liberal pro-Communist romance, full of lies and Hollywood evil. The review concludes that films like Reds don't get made anymore. To that remark I agree, though my attitude towards Reds, Hollywood, Beatty and film making of this stature is completely different than said review.  <br />This is an amazing film. Epic in nature and intimate in quality, it beautifully weaves togather the World War I era in America, Socialist political machinations, so-called Leftist radicals (and their views, anger and work), friendship infused with national urgency and a dynamic love story of distinct personalities coping with their place in history and each other. <br />Praise was granted Beatty, in the form of an Academy Award, Directors Guild, and Golden Globe for Best Director, but this is a film which ought to be regarded with greater esteem.  <br />Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson and Maureen Stapleton give incredible performances. Beatty, the lead as John Reed, journalist and activist, revolutionary and lover is also quite funny and thoughtful. Keaton, as Reed's love, Louise Bryant is fiesty, angry, empassioned, and sublime as she witnesses and fights for John, searches him out and brings calm to a chaotic life. Nicholson as playwright Eugene O'Neill is awesome. With the beauty of doing so very little, he is scathing, vicious, heart broken and poetic. Nicholson is in command here like never before. Rather than the working class characters he played in The Last Detail, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, or The Postman Always Rings Twice, he is an intellectual, a poet and artist, a captain of words and emotion, beset by the pain and horror O'Neill put on stage.  <br />But the performances are one aspect of this film. Vittorio Storaro's (Apocalypse Now, The Last Emperor, The Sheltering Sky)cinematography is stunning, capturing darkened smokey meeting halls and low ceilinged cabins, expansive Russian palaces,the streets of New York City, deserts of the Middle east, and snowy Russian tundras.  <br />As well, this film deals with the touchy, and for the time (1980-1981) very dangerous issue of Communist Russia, Socialism in America, Capitatistic rule, American unionization and the significant struggles therein. <br />For people to drop a film like this in the bin of Left Wing Propaganda is trite and ignorant. Surely Beatty's politics were in play here, but there is a far deeper and interesting story to be told. While the revolution in 1917 in Russia marked the 20th Century, this tale of a man and woman's becoming, his expression and fight for ideas, the difficult fight for equality or political regard, the challenge of maintaining a private relationship while working for a different world, and the scope of humanity's need to better ourselves by challenging dominant paradigms and establishments, this is an important and successful film.  <br />It hopefully will be available on DVD, and would be wise to include supplementalinformation which surrounds the circumstances and history of this story.  <br />
B0001BKAEE|4.0|Well this is it the last of the most original and creative stories of all time. And here we go again more haters tearin this movie apart for no reason. YA it was a little slower than the second and first but WHO CARES if it got a good story who cares, what the hell did u expect to happen since the first movie they talked about the final war between man and  machine so thats what they showed us  , my only complaint was that i did want to see more of neo kickin some ass like in the reloaded which is the best chapter in the trilogy but revolutions is second best for sure . And what fight scene can beat the final fight with neo and smith that was the best fight i EVER saw in a movie in my life it was sick. So ya for all you haters who cant apreciate a good unique movie like this then thats your loss its a good movie with great action and the best fight ever to end the movie, it would get a perfect 5 if there was less war and more fighting inside the matrix with neo and it does fall a little short from matrix reloaded but its still a very good movie with amazing graphics
0671027387|4.0|I enjoy Dan's writing style. He writes in a way that keeps you wanting to learn more while several things are going on at once and then it all ties in at the end. Interesting concept of NASA vs politics. Some technical stuff hard to follow.
0425152251|3.0|John Doe walked to his mailbox, and found the following letter from an unknown person: <br /> <br />Sophie's World: <br /> <br />This book is no different than what everyone else says. It is essentially an EXTREMELY basic philosophy textbook stuck into an EXTREMELY basic novel. The extremely rudimentary language of the novel (possibly due to a poor translation from the Norwegian) and the slightly less than average plot (an unknown philosopher sends Sophie letters that cover the history of philosophy) make it worth wondering: why am I not just reading biography or philosophy web pages about each of these philosophers or, better yet, just read a philosophy textbook? Had the history of philosophy been woven into this book more fluidly, it might have turned out better. It seemed to me like the plot was an excuse for the meat of the book, the philosophy. This book does have some redeeming qualities, however. The philosophical matter is, for the most part, very interesting and worthy for everyone at any age to consider. The only problem with this novel is that it is a novel at all. It reads like an episode of \\"The Magic School Bus,\\" where the fictional part of the story is merely a gimmick to keep one's attention. If I had not needed to read it for school (International Baccalaureate Theory of Knowledge - an advanced high school philosophy-ish course), I would have skipped the plot and just read the philosophy part, which is conveniently differentiated from the rest of the novel by the use of a different font. <br /> <br />Who knows, maybe I just missed the point, but it seems like an extremely contrived novel with the information part just jammed into it. If you don't mind poor writing and want to read a little about philosophy, go for it. If you do mind poor writing and want to read a little about philosophy, go for it and skip the plot part. The plot part, though, is very useless except to serve as an excuse to bring up philosophical questions such as \\"why are Legos the most ingenious toys?\\" Why does there have to be a plot? <br /> <br />John wondered: what the heck is this doing in my mailbox, and who is this person? Tune in next chapter for more reviews and a little more plot! <br />
0061015725|4.0|Once again, Michael Crichton has amazed me.  Crichton has gone above and beyond what a good book consists of, time and time again.  Prey is focused on nanotechnology; the study of small particles.  These particles have the capability of doing all matter of chores that are given to them.  When things go wrong, Jack Forman must find a way to save his life, save his children, and save civilization from ruining itself with the new technology.  While Prey was not Crichton's best book, it was one that I enjoyed immensely, and had a hard time putting down.  It was a fast-paced thriller, with a solid warning in place.  Even in the light of discovery, some things aren't meant to be played with.   <br />Following the rest of his books, Crichton's theme is deep, and backed up by bone-chilling possibilities and endless problems that could arise with this source of technology.  Like in Jurassic Park, Crichton uses terror and discovery as a way to show the reader just how far science could go, and how far it should never get.  The plot was intense, though I had a hard time understanding the very specific technology related to the book.  The book was so detailed, that at points I did not follow completely.  However, I really enjoyed Prey and read the message loud and clear.
B000000HTL|5.0|I'm glad you like the band and this ablum, but as far as Guy Evans being just moderatly competent your showing very little knowledge of drumming. While he may not be as tight as Bill Bruford, he makes playing in odd meters with multiple changes look effortless in the DVD. Just being able to play this music is worth more than that. Also Jackson plays some of the most creative sax and devices I've ever heard. Your review just seemed like a backhanded compliment to me. <br />
B00005JLR8|5.0|In America is a brilliant film about an Irish family who moves to New York in search of better opportunities for themselves. While this sounds like a cliche, the story and characters are anything but, and because of this, they resonate deeply with the viewer. Instead of a hackneyed family-getting-to-know-America story, we get people dealing with real issues, struggling not only to fit in in their new home, but also to fit in in their own family. <br /> <br />The Sullivan family moves to New York, and they are basically flat broke and with no prospects for income. The Sullivans consist of father Johnny (Paddy Considine), mother Sarah (Samantha Morton), and their daughters Christy and Ariel (real-life Dublin sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger). They are dealing with the loss of their son Frankie, who Christy believes is watching over them, and will grant their wishes when they really need them. Johnny and Sarah have been dealing with the loss in different ways: Sarah would rather just be able to forget her son and concentrate on loving her daughters who are still alive, but Johnny has never been able to distance himself from Frankie. <br /> <br />They move into an apartment in a house filled with junkies, and a downstairs neighbor who often screams quite loudly. They eventually meet this man, Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), and discover that he's actually quite an amiable man, though Johnny is hesitant to accept him, suspicious of his motives. The girls develop a fondness for Mateo, as he plays games with them, and when Sarah becomes pregnant again, Mateo assures her that good things will come with the new baby. However, Sarah learns that if the baby will have health problems if it comes too soon, and she herself will have health problems if it's too late. However, the girls become worried when Mateo's health begins deteriorating, and when their father becomes increasingly distant as he struggles to keep his family afloat in America. <br /> <br />Director Jim Sheridan co-wrote thescreenplay with his daughter Naomi based on their own life story, and it's clear from the outset that this is a perfectly realistic portrayal of a family with hopes and dreams that often exceed their means. This is not a fairy tale story of American opportunity and success; instead it is a story of personal pain and the difficulties we have in coping with the loss of family members taken from us at an early age. <br /> <br />The acting is phenomenal by everyone involved. Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton both give wonderfully nuanced performance in difficult roles: they have to be loving parents and spouses, yet detached and melancholy at the same time, and they pull it off. The young actors are excellent as well: Emma Bolger infuses Ariel with sprightly vigor, and Sarah Bolger creates the character of Christy as a young girl who's been forced to grow up faster than she'd like, but taking it all in stride. And Djimon Hounsou, who is usually cast as some sort of African barbarian, finally gets an opportunity to play a character that is not just a stereotypical role. Mateo is at first unsettling, but Hounsou's charisma allows us to believe in the size of Mateo's heart and his raw passion for life. <br /> <br />I cannot say enough good things about In America. It is a tale filled with wonderful characters, and it manages to bring across its theme of hope without using sentimental sap, but rather by investing its story in its characters and not the other way around. We feel their sadness and can relate to their feelings and actions, though we might not always agree with what they do or say. But that's life: we don't always want to act a certain way, but sometimes it's not up to us. You just have to trust in your loved ones to carry some of the load for you.

B0002V7OI8|5.0|Immersed in the purest tradition of the disaster films category that literally covered a wide spectrum in the American cinematography of the early seventies (From Airport, The Towering Inferno, Poseidon Adventure and Earthquake among the most representatives) the story maintains certain force due the intriguing of the script. A comet recently discovered will collapse unavoidably with the Earth unless the mankind made something for avoiding it. In this order of ideas, the picture runs for three different movements. The initial drama in which the President of the United States will inform to the citizens and the rest of the world about the imminent fact and the personal ethic conflict of the female journalist. The second Movement concerns with the mission itself, the presentation to the Press and the encountered feelings of the members of the mission with Robert Duvall as the most experienced of them: Excellent cynicism when Duvall answers them: \\" It's not a video game\\". Finally the long Third Movement presents in its own a \\"Theme with Variations\\" . the breakthrough of the expectations when the mission fails despite all the efforts. Personally I found this sequence something cold in its dramatic resolution: it lacked emotion , the second variation is the reiterate Presidential message announcing the failure and the explanation for this neo Darwinian selection process of the one million human beings considered to live during two years in a modern Noah's Arc in an underground city built in Missouri caverns, the dramatic sequences derived as a natural consequence of the imminent collision will interweave all the secondary lines with absolute veracity.<br /><br />Additionally you will be invited to presence an admirable cast with Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell in little roles but so convincing and well portrayed , Tea Leoni is surprising in her role she is nowadays one of the ten most beautiful actress in the world and makes a worthy performance but in the case of Robert Duvall to my mind, was wasted in an insignificant role. Duvall is much more than a great actor; he is a living legend and his stature by itself did not deserve that treatment. Freeman and Cromwell as solvent as always give to this film a particular bright and it will be remembered for the future generations without any shadow of doubt.Duvall to my mind, was wasted in an insignificant role.

0375432302|5.0|First, I'd like to say what a huge fan I have become of this fantastic writer.  Since Brown's first book actually.  Brown is hard to top in this exciting genre, in my opinion.<br /><br />THE DA VINCI CODE, is a fast-paced, roller-coster ride taking the reader on a historic journey they will think about for a long, long, long time to come.<br /><br />Fantastic, unique, page-turning, thought-provoking, is what The Da Vinci Code is all about.  I loved it.  The story as written by Brown offers the reader a lot to think about (fiction or not), I, for one, couldn't put this book down, and I was sad when it ended.<br /><br />I can hardly wait for Brown's next novel to hit the bookshelves!<br /><br />(I give The Da Vinci Code My Highest Recommendation!)

0790729628|1.0|The movie is great the quality of this DVD is horrible. It appears to shimmy and shake as if someone were sitting in a theater with a camcorder. Very displeased with this purchase - should be sold in the $1 bin not as a $10 item. You would be better off with VHS or perhaps LaserDisc. Wait for the rumored forthcoming \\"definitive\\" DVD release by Ridley Scott the director.
B000286RKW|5.0|This is director Martin Scorese's best film. It is the best film about the mob you can watch. The cast and story line give the viewer a front row seat in the life of a modern day mobster. Following Ray Liotta's character Henry as he grows up in the \\"family.\\" A wonderful film to watch, even at the 2 hour and 45 minute running time, it doesn't even feel that long.
0062502182|4.0|Brazilian author Paulo Coelho tells a fable like no other. Through the course of The Alchemist, Santiago, an Andalusian Shepard boy, takes a shot at following his dreams. So he sets out on a courageous adventure in hope of someday finding the treasure in the pyramids of Egypt, and meeting the Alchemist.   <br /> <br /> Beginning in Spain, he follows his heart. Having to travel across the desert is not the only obstacle Santiago is faced with. He's befriended by a thief in who his money leaving Santiago no choice but to find a job. His salvation is found through a crystal merchant, who was able to give him enough money to continue on with his journey. Farther along the way, he runs into an Englishman who is astonished with Santiago's courage and ability to follow his dreams. Also along the way he is faced with one of the most difficult decisions in life. That is, falling in love with Fatima. Loving her, he soon comes to realize that his love for her is the most important thing in the world.  <br />On the last step of his journey, Santiago is welcomed by a very peculiar character that we have been dying to meet. For it's the Alchemist. Through the Alchemist, Santiago learns the ways of the language and life of the desert. <br /> <br /> Through the journey of this book, I learned that dreams can be fulfilled if you have the courage, spirit and mind to follow them and to take chances. This book teaches you how to trust your heart. Its intensity and tension is dramatic, yet it's a charming fable for people of all ages, especially for teenagers. I enjoyed reading this wonderful, loving story, and if you give it a shot. I'm sure you'll love it to. <br />
B00062IVKS|5.0|This is the best sports film you will ever be privied to. Robert Deniro is at the top of his game here and it makes the film all the better. The story of an aging and faltering boxer is the most humanistic story you can find in any sports film. <br /> <br />Scorese hit the nial on the head here, it is quite possibly his best film, and may remain so for years to come. The casting by Corman was great and every character was perfect in their interations with Deniro, it looked so natural!! It was the best film of the 1980's according to AFI and deserves that recognition.

B00008BXJF|3.0|I'd recieved \\"Larks Tongues In Aspic\\" about twenty years ago through a music club, and didn't care for it. Years later (just a couple weeks ago) on a UK Internet radio station that plays progressive and psychedelic rock, I heard an entire side from the \\"Lizard\\" release, which I thought was rather interesting. I looked up the CD on Amazon, and then one way or another came into contact with information on \\"The Power To Believe\\", and based on the reviews figured it might be a good place to reintroduce KC to myself, and see if my musical pallette had changed over the years -- that perhaps I simply wasn't \\"ready\\" for KC music those twenty odd years before.<br /><br />Being a Pink Floyd music fan, and in general, liking well made thematic concept albums, I thought TPTB might be a double treat. I pop the CD into the player and here comes the title track -- a corny digitized voice of Adrien Belew (I'd only previously known of him from a song titled \\"Oh Daddy\\" back in the 80's) singing \\"She carries me in days of apathy ... she watches (or washes) over me. She changed my life, in a matter of speaking, when she gave me back the power to believe.\\" So the questions arise: who is \\"she\\"? how did \\"she\\" change his life? and what was it that he previously didn't believe or lost faith in, before \\"she\\" came along? I suspected that in the content of the CD, the identity of \\"she\\" would be revealed, and perhaps clues to the other questions might be given.<br /><br />LEVEL FIVE, starts off with an explosion of guitar whaling that designed to startle and astound the listener and to prepare them for the rest of the track. However, I expected it. I thought as the first track played \\"I'll bet the next track will come on like gangbusters\\" and sure enough, it did. And all the worse, since I expected it, the effect was lost. I only felt a slight contempt for the musicians, for not being smarter than me. The music continued with an electronic sinister brutality that I found rather interesting, though I kept hoping for a small break, perhaps some human voice mixture in order to actually heighten the tension, but none came. The song ran way too long, and was so relentless and repetitive that it just became grating, uninventive. A few lessons from Mike Oldfield's \\"Tubular Bells\\" would be in order here. In all honesty I thought it sounded like what some teenage boy with a mix program on his computer might render and present to a rave club.<br /><br />EYES WIDE OPEN offered a more radio friendly type tune with some pretty cool jazzy stuff going on.<br /><br />ELECTRIK I think is one of the better electronic sounding songs I've heard -- catchy and sometimes creepy.<br /><br />FACTS OF LIFE is just another attempt to throw some seemingly disturbing images into my mind and then to wax philosophical. Eh, whatever.<br /><br />THE POWER TO BELIEVE II (and including all the other versions of this song) is out of place. This isn't a concept album at all, dammit! It's just a rehashing of this silly grouping of words and music that have no connection to the rest of the tracks. I'm feeling cheated now.<br /><br />DANGEROUS CURVES is barely memorable -- an electronic tune, like a train, on a track, trying to make it to a desination but never arriving. Slightly reminiscent of LUCIFER by The Alan Parsons Project, but nowhere nearly as good. A disappointment.<br /><br />HAPPY TO BE WITH WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE HAPPY WITH comes on and I can dig the sarcasm! I'm gonna repeat the cho-rus!!! Heheheheh. The only problem with the song is the insertion of the title. What the heck does being happy with what you have to be happy with, have to do with lousey soundalike rock bands that permeate public radio waves? Maybe he's now being sarcastic to the folks who buy the lousey soundalike rock band CD's? If so, then I get \\"it\\" -- if not, then I don't.<br /><br />THE POWER TO BELIEVE parts III and IV. Yawn. Pink Floyd legitimately did this with Another Brick In The Wall, but this is just ridiculous. And yet, with another Floydian influence, the album ends the way it begins ... and that's a problem. The CD ends EXACTLY the way it begings, so instead of hearing something cool, like a heartbeat fading out at the end, looping and fading back in an eternal circle, as in Pink Floyd's \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"The Wall\\", what you get is indeed, the exact same song played twice in a row. Egad!<br /><br />Overall, coming from someone who is not predisposed to liking KC music, I have to say that this is a boring album and it's no wonder to me why I hardly ever (actually I've never) run into anyone saying \\"Yeah, my favourite band is King Crimson\\". Though the CD is not a total loss, I'm not too thrilled about having spent my hard-earned dollars on it. Thankfully I bought it used for $6.99. I may or may not keep it. However, in all fairness, based on the music from \\"Lizard\\" that I head on the UK radio station, I'll probably buy that CD.is is just ridiculous.

B000088E6D|5.0|Wow.  This guy can really sing, not just pretend to.  As a college student, there's no way I can have this CD on while studying--I end up singing along or just closing my eyes and listening.  Much recommended tracks--\\"Fever\\" (my favorite) and \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love.\\"  Marvelous CD!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Franz Ferdinand plays like the return of glam rock, and this time with a brain.  Art gallery videos where the band prances like mascara-ed Beatles helped propel Franz to prominence.  Both drumlines and basslines throb insistently and infectious hooks are de rigeur song after song:  Disco + Rock?   <br /> <br />This self-titled album is a \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" for the 21st century, directing its love songs at both sexes and playing its rock music with campy glam.  At their undeniable hooky best in \\"This Fire,\\" \\"Take Me Out,\\" \\"Forty Feet,\\" and \\"Darts of Pleasure\\" Franz pull off the extremely tricky feat of fusing catchy syncopation of house music with the propulsive drive of rock.  As for their themes, the band sounds like art school kids on a weekend in the city, open-minded to whatever adventures, cinematic or sexual, they may fall into.  On a fine line between gay and straight, quirky and mainstream, dance and alt rock, unapologetic hedonists Franz Ferdinand pour their Weimar glamor into the best album of the year.
B0007WZUMO|5.0|With Teeth is INCREDIBLE!  A word to the wise:  Don't expect to be kicked in the gut by pulsating industrial beats and machine clatter, if you're looking for another Downward Spiral or another Fragile, well, this is no the place to look.  Think of this along the melodics of Still and the raw energy of And All That Could have been.  While [With_Teeth] is brutal in it's own way, and beautiful at moments, this albums is a full on pop rock.  I recently listened to Bleed Like Me by Garbage, and this sounds also a bit like that, except Trent managed to make this sound great.   <br />This is a concept album continuing with what The Fragile left unfinished, and it's about opening your eyes to new possibilities and expanding you horizons, as long as you remember that sometimes taking a step back is actually taking three steps forward.  If you've come to love NIN for it's angty music, you can still find solace in this, only the self destructiveness is gone, and Trent let's loose of his vocal abilities (he does sound amazing, and experiments with different vocals).  There is also lyrical self reference to other songs like Even Deeper, Down in It, and the persisting \\"Nothing can stop me now\\" mantra is still here, but now the context in which they are placed are quite different. <br />Music wise, no longer feeling to hide behind a wall of dissonance , this album is much more jam like than engineered into a twirp-beep-slash of downward spiral.  The beats aren't as assaulting as they are inviting, and the overall tone is that of Still, tracks like The Line Begins to Blur scrunch and buzz untill the chorus comes along with an ethereal guitar riff. <br />So here's a track review: <br />\\"All the love in the world\\":  Builds up like Somewhat Damaged or Into The Void.  Starts of like Piggy until it becomes an incredible \\"why do you get all the love in the world?\\" chant which is quite dinamic and upbeat. <br /> <br />\\"You Know Who You Are\\": This is more classic NIN, sounds like somethingfrom Broken, really aggressive and easy to head bang to. (5/5) <br /> <br />\\"The Collector\\": Reminescent of Please or No, You Don't, great rock track. Nice bassline, distortion and vocals \\"swallow it all, swallow it all!\\" (4/5) <br /> <br />\\"The Hand that Feeds\\": Great song. Go to NIN.COM to watch the video, if you haven't already.  This is not the strongest song in the album. (4.5/5) <br /> <br />\\"Love is not enough\\": Think \\"looking foward to joining you, finally\\" meets Burn. Need I say more? (5/5) <br /> <br />\\"Every Day is Exactly the same\\":  This was somewhat as a surprise, the best song on this album.  Electronic pulsating synths layered by Trent's emotional singing and breaks into a beautiful chorus \\"there no love here and there is no pain, every day is exactly the same\\" and Trent's singing is very touching, there's nothing on the NIN catalogue that resembles this. (10/5) <br />\\"With Teeth\\": Sexy bass to furious drums, again Trent singing differently.  Not exactly the best track, but it has yet to grow on me.  good song, just not amazing. (3.5/5) <br /> <br />\\"Only\\":  Another pleasant surprise.  This is a 80's pop arrangement with a driving distorted funk bass, and spoken lyrics. This is a conversation between him and his depression in an attempt to break away from it \\"there is no you, there is only me\\".  Another great track (10/5). <br /> <br />\\"getting smaller\\":  Fast and punk like, and don't forget aggressive. Great riffs and some of the best vocals.  Think March of the Pigs. (5/5) <br /> <br />\\"Sunspots\\":  Starts up like \\"LFTJU,F\\" and moves into a synth rock extravanganza.  Great song, just give a minute or two.  this is reminds me of the best moments of The Fragile. (4.5/5) <br /> <br />\\"The Line Begins to Blur\\".  Overcompressed percussion and Trent screaming, develops into a gorgeous, numbing Still like moment. The sense of frustration and false commodity get through as the  spine chiling \\"just how far down can i go, i don't know, i don't know\\".  10/5 <br /> <br />\\"Beside you in time\\"  This contains the sample in the With Teeth teaser release last year. Listening to the lyrics you can understand why this album was formely named Bleedthrough.  An abstract track. 4/5 <br /> <br />\\"Right where it belongs\\"  this another beautiful hurt-like song, but think of lennon's imagine.  the production on this song shifts from one sound to another, very touching track.  Don't expect hurt 2, though, this is not downward spiral, and a brutal album need a brutal closer, and it's more about realization than obliteration.  Beautifull, this could have been in Still or Things Falling Apart. 10/5 <br /> <br />\\"Home\\" Trent sings his heart out in this.  A slow emotional song, also outstanding.  Those modular synths are quite the nice. I don't know why they didn't include this in the american release. 5/5 <br /> <br />This, as are all NIN albums, and outstanding record. It's melodic, it's hard, it breaths, it screams, and at moments, it even cries.  Don't miss this, but it's better to keep an open.  This is a new step for nine inch nails, they've not made any breakthroughs with With Teeth other than to experiment with good song writting and even better singing and performing.  This is suble, not brutal, beautifully raw and inspiring.
0783227434|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite zombie, horror movie and at the same time it's one of those movies that made me laugh also the most. No, this is not another zombie cheap flick (when I say cheap I mean horrible) it's one of those films that will give you the chills and will make you spill your drink, if you're having any, due to the laughter that will be inevitable.  <br /> <br />If you have seen 'The Evil Dead' then you're on the right track to start this one since it is the sequal. Bruce Campell's character goes to the midieval age to try to find a way back to the present, modern time. But in order to do that he must go into a journey fighting the dead itself. You will see how the can guy can screw up and will make you laugh alot and also how he kicks zombie ass in this movie, which all scenes showing are truly original.
B0006284JQ|4.0|I have to admit that I am a fan of Britney Spears, and that is mostly because I was at the ideal age of 14 when she hit the market. It would be fair to say that I kind of grew up with her. However, looking back at tracks like \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and the especially horrible \\"Sometimes\\" I have to wonder what I was thinking (Thank God I did not see Crossroads). Then again there were the Spice Girls, various boy-bands, and other equally atrocious artists that ascended to the top of the charts. We all have our dumb moments and jump on these band-wagons; it just so happens that in doing so we make no-talent teenagers and media tycoons rich. But they are quick to fade, and in Britney's case she has a lousy husband and a baby to keep her company (along with all the money she could need). I guess the moral of the story is that she should be grateful for 5 successful albums, because some much more deserving people never get that satisfaction, and 6 years is an eternity in the pop-world. <br /> <br />There are a few good tracks here: Toxic, Crazy, Slave, and Boys are worth their weight in stainless-steel.
0790729652|5.0|Dark, mysterious, intriguing is what Batman is characterized in this film. Basically everything that should of been taken consideration for the Dark Knight himself is all here, with director Tim Burton converting finally what was a long wait from the great comic book hero into one of the most acclaimed films based on heroes.<br /><br />This is one of Michael Keaton's (Bruce Wayne, Batman) best work, aswell with Jack Nicholson (The Joker) who gives one of the best evil geniuses characters based on a book come to life.<br /><br />Director Tim Burton knew from the start how Batman should be shown on screen and he couldnt have done it more perfect. He does it again with 'Batman Return' which is also extraordinary like this one.<br /><br />To own indeed.
B0006I0SEO|5.0|From what I can tell, this is Charlie Kaufman's take on the philosophy of Love and Memory. Kaufman handles it with an incredible level of creativity and Michael Gondry (the director) renders his words with equally incredible beauty.<br />This is a smart love story. It isn't just about two people getting together under some strange circumstances and falling for each other and some string of conflicts tests their relationshop and it all works out at the end. No, this is Charlie's Kaufman's love story, of course it's nothing like that.<br />It's brings up so many different ideas concerning relationships and memory, and how Kaufman ties it all together is, can't say this enough, incredible.<br />The cast also does a fine job with their respective roles.<br />If you've ever seen any of Michael Gondry's work, you'll know what to expect here. If you haven't, it's deliciously clever stuff.<br />The extras are okay. I would've loved to know more about Kaufman's and Gondry's creative process, you know, see them discuss their ideas more in-depth, but as it is, it's not bad.
B00004Y6NU|4.0|I got this CD becuase Telegraph Road was new and I thought would <br />be my longest song ever! They did their greatest work at the end <br />of that song. And it suddenly grew on me and I like it a whole lot. It is fourteen minutes and seventeen second song. Very long. <br />Other than that Private Investigations is the weakest song on the <br />entire CD. I have not checked any of the other tracks out other than those 2. So you might as well get this album as much as Making Movies & On Every Street. <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|OK, OK OK OK. Mariah, Mariah, you have totally changed how I felt about you from your past 3 albums. This album is like listening to you alll over gain, when i was 5 when you came out with Vision Of Love. You are great. I like, I mean, I love every damn song, gosh. I dont know what to say, but listening to this, I dont expect no less then this album. Fantasia and Mariah. It is you guys's Year.
B000957O82|5.0|I don't belive this. This my first to review this now. This is great. I getting this DVD. His movie is fun and funny. One man who tried to date the woman. One man who help him. Will Smith dcan help. What kind job is this? A Date Doctor? That smart isn't You got to learn how to date women. Will can do everything went to date the women. You have to listen what he said from the begining of the movie. One guy wents to married the one women who is in charge. Get it or tried it by yourself.
B000009EAD|5.0|WOW! This was the first Iced Earth album I bought... and after buying and listening to the rest of their catalogue I have to say this one is my fave! I played it through about three or four times the day I bought it and memorized pretty much all of the lyrics that day; these songs are really catchy... anthem-like, if you will.<br /><br />Their mix of heavy rockers and power ballads on this album will either \\"Rally the Troops\\" or \\"Bore them to death\\"... depends on the listeners taste... However, no one can deny the intense Something Wicked Trilogy!!<br /><br />Favorite song from the album: Melancholy (Holy Martyr)
B0006399FS|5.0|I came in hoping for a repeat of ATYCLB, and frankly was disappointed at first.  Beig a fan of almost every U2 album old and new (only october rates mediocre to me)I don't prefer a specific style to another, so no bias from that.  I listened to it once, thought it was vaguely interesting and descent but that was about it.  A few spotty listens yielded the same results, but upon purchasing tickets to their concert in anaheim I listened more and more to learn it, and you know what... it grew on me. <br />     Other than the rock-single power of vertigo no song is indiviudally a standout, it is more a note in consistency.  The first half of the album (tracks 1-6) are its strength, but the only one of the 12 tracks (with the bonus track) I don't care for is the boring one step closer.  So, if at first you don't like it, listen a few more times before quitting on it, you might be rewarded.
B00005TT77|1.0|I accidently heard this and think it is a terrible album.  Why would anybody in their right mind want to listen to bad cover versions of classic songs by mediocre \\"artists?\\"  Why not listen to the originals? Nobody should be allowed to touch The Beatles' music. Ever. The horrible versions of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and the masterpiece \\"Let it Be\\" are especially heinous, but they are all terrible in their own ways. Some are almost insulting.  The people contributing to this soundtrack can only wish that they'll be remembered and relevant in 40 years. Maybe I'm sounding harsh, but if you are truly a Beatles fan, you will probably agree with me.  Oh, and the movie was terrible too.
B0007GAERG|4.0|One of the things I've always loved about Mariah is that she always delivers a compilation of good songs.  I wish she would pay more attention to the way she dresses these days.  For the past 6 years, she's been dressing like a hoochie.  Her look is the hoochie type but her songs are not.   <br /> <br />This is a great album which I honestly favor over her last release which was CHARMBRACELET.  My favorite Mariah album would be RAINBOW which was released in 1999. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a good album and I recommend purchase.
B0007GAERG|5.0|One word...Marvelous.  I have never been a fan for Mariah, but now I am her #1 FAN.  Every song will be a hit, and if she doesn not get a grammy, I am going to picket outside the award ceremony.  I curl every night, going to sleep with her songs on her mind.  She is probably the \\"QUEEN\\" of R&B.  Move over Whitney, step aside Alicia, Beyonce...who???  Enough said!
B0007DAZW8|5.0|On my first listen, I thought to myself, \\"Bollocks! What the heck is going on here?!\\" On my second listen, I ended liking a track or two. By the third listen, I couldn't explain it, but I was hooked! I am predominently a trance and house person, so I really enjoyed the previous Daft Punk albums. This is a great departure from their previous works but surprisingly, the more techno-esque feel to the album works! It is bold and I love the noise and the organized chaos they have encapsulated in the songs... <br /> <br />My only real qualm with the album is the \\"Make Love\\" track which appears randomly in the middle. The change in tone and pace disrupted my listening groove!
B00006LIRI|3.0|Toward the end of RATTLE AND HUM, Bono announced that U2 would disappear and come back a different band.  We hear these kinds of promises all the time and so no one took them all that seriously.  But they did change.  Their Christian, Pacifist do-gooder image was turned inside out and Bono turned into this \\"Fly\\" character in greasy hair and sunglasses complete with a sweaty, creepy aura that was intended to repeal as much as his earlier image attracted.  The bass player (the openly non-Christian in the group) getting busted for cocaine at the airport helped things along.<br /><br />Thus a disconnect was achieved-in some ways all too well.  If for one generation U2 came to its creative apex with JOSHUA TREE, for this next group of youth ACHTUNG BABY said it all.  For those coming of age in the 1990's, the U2 of the 1980's was just a little too precious in its earnest mysticism of OCTOBER and THE UNFORGETABLE FIRE.  Meanwhile, early fans of the band tended to find the band's new pretense of decadence and excess masking an even more earnest social awareness just a little bit too obvious and boring.  Individual songs could shine; but the albums themselves were not that memorable.  Early fans found themselves not giving a damn.<br /><br />U2  THE BEST OF 1990-2000 & B SIDES will not help.  It is a confusing mish-mash of hits, re-mixes, new songs, re-mixes of the new songs, movie soundtrack songs and I suppose what stands in for \\"B-Sides\\" in this age of digital.  30 cuts over two discs is an awful long listen and for my money I could have lived without half of it.  I do quite enjoy \\"Electrical Storm (William Orbit Mix)\\" and have put it into the mix of songs I keep for personal listening pleasure.  But \\"Mrs. Sarajevo\\" and \\"The Hands That Built America\\" are sonic turds of the worst of rock in movies.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the world burns.  Bono runs to the U.N. to beg for compassion and then the band flies off to some godforsaken corner of the earth to play \\"Beautiful Day\\" to the uncomprehending and unfortunate natives.  All is meant well and good is done.  Maybe that is enough.  That still doesn't mean this album is any good.  Bits and pieces are good.  As a whole it is a drag.ful Day\\" to the uncomprehending and unfortunate natives.  All is meant well and good is done.  Maybe that is enough.  That still doesn't mean this album is any good.

B00005JMAH|2.0|A very weak adaptation, poorly acted, major plot points omitted ... the heart of the book is completely missing from the big screen. <br /> <br />Contrary to Cuaron, I never viewed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban as a \\"coming of age\\" book or story for Harry & Company.  That is more the province of Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix.  Prisoner of Azkaban is the book in which we get the \\"backstory\\" on James Potter ... without that backstory, the character of Sirius is never revealed as trustworthy, honorable, and wrongly accused of murder.  There is no explanation at the climax of the movie as to why Harry all of sudden buys Sirius' innocence and turns on Pettigrew and Snape. <br /> <br />Cinematography on this movie, while interesting, makes Hogwarts look most forbidding and like no place I'd like to visit.  Hogwarts from the books and from the first two movies is presented as a magical place ... Cuaron's Hogwarts looks like Azkaban.  Wait, maybe that's what he thought he was designing ... perhaps he thought \\"Harry\\" was the prisoner of Azkaban.  It's understandable considering that I doubt poor Cuaron even read the book, so much is missing. <br /> <br />I simply could not get past the omissions and Dan Radcliffe's embarrassing performance. <br /> <br />Don't waste your money on this one.  Let's all hope that Goblet delivers ... if it doesn't, I'm finished with these movies.
0393035158|5.0|For over seventeen hundred years the powerful male dominated institutions of organized religion have perverted our inherent spirituality and kept us divided and often even at war with each other over disagreements about petty and largely unprovable points of religious dogma. In realizing this truth, Sam Harris has accurately perceived the fact that our religious institutions have never worked for us and in fact, have been the singular cause for the failure of our spiritual progress. Sam makes a rational and compelling argument for the idea that we need to reexamine what we believe and how we came to believe it as a means of transcending the childish and superstitious notions of religion that have promoted most of the intolerance and bigotry among us. His reasoned and thoughtful insights will resonate with all who are on a spiritual quest and who by now have realized that religion is not the answer. For those spiritual seekers who have felt the gentle urging to move on but still haven't let go or haven't yet found a new direction, \\"The End of Faith\\" is for you. It will be a valuable step in your spiritual evolution and may compel you toward the discovery of other numerous titles that have also addressed the need to reexamine our religious beliefs. \\"The End of Faith\\" joins recent titles such as \\"The Trouble With Islam\\", \\"Why Christianity Must Change or Die\\", and a soon to be released book titled \\"Lost, The Rescue of Spirituality From The Perversions of Organized Religion\\" and many other titles now forming a groundswell of spiritual rediscovery. I strongly recommend this book to all true spiritual seekers everywhere.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0425152251|5.0|This book has easily become one of my favourite books. It is the first book I read of Mr. Gaarder and highly recommend it to anyone, especially teens. Sophie's World as many people have said, put philosophy in an extremely accessible medium. The language used is simple as Sophie (the main character) is only 15. The idea behind the book, I found, though it was not believable to be extremely unique and exciting. After reading more of Mr.Gaarder's work, you can easily see a trend in his writing and gain a better understanding of why Sophie's world was written the way it was.     I hope that, if you are looking for a nice summer read for the beach that you will pick up this book. If anything, it will provide you with a brief idea of our history's thinkers and leave you thinking for yourself.
0786880708|5.0|I've been looking for information on meditating for quite some time and thankfully I finally found this book. I can't believe it took me as long as it did since this book is a classic. <br /> <br />The book is broken up into three parts. The first part explains what mediation is, and what it isn't. The second part describes how to go about meditating. Finally the third part describe what you can expect to get out of meditation, and what you can't. <br /> <br />This is one of the most insightful books I've read on just about any subject. If you are just looking into mediation or have been doing it for years, I'd highly recommend this book
0553296981|3.0|The diary of a young girl<br /><br />The Diary of a young girl is about a little Jewish girl who is in hiding from the Nazi's. It's all about the 1940's holocaust, and how she has to live her life and adapt to the new rules and ways of living. Ann Franks diary shares tells us all about who she had to share the attic with and how she had to act with people and how people are always arguing. The holocaust was probably a scary thing to experience, but now that it's all over it's an exciting topic to learn or read about.<br /><br /> All though most people like to read about the holocaust, not everyone would like to read this book. It's a really good book, but it seems more of a book that only a girl would like to read. She does like to talk about boys every so often, and how her and her mom are always having a problem with Mrs. Van daan.<br /><br /> People may expect to hear \\"and they lived happily ever after\\". In so many stories or biographies, they show how people have improved in life, kind of like a big turning point in life. But not everything goes the way she wants it to go in life. I really think that it was written excellently for a little girl who is only about 10 or 12 years old. So yea over all it's a really good book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a diary book.

0385512104|3.0|This book starts out as a murder mystery novel through the eyes of a sixteen-year-old autistic boy named Christopher. Extremely smart when it comes to Math and Science, but lacking in understanding of other people and common sense. The plot is interwoven with puzzles and diagrams that help explain his complex way of thinking.  <br />   Christopher masters his everyday routine and has his days planned out to the minute, but when he finds himself in an unusual situation, he must use all of his brainpower and bravery to get through what to us seems like just an average rain ride. Fearful of strangers, disliking yellow and brown, and betrayed by his own father, Christopher gives the readers a greater understanding of the autistic mind, and is guaranteed to stay in the hearts and minds of all who read his story. <br />
0767817710|1.0|I don't write many reviews, and only a few are negative.  But I feel compelled to spill my guts on this \\"movie\\". In one word, \\"AWFUL!\\". <br /> <br />My wife wanted to see Russell Crowe (what's he got that I don't?). Crowe's performance was excellent even though the movie sucked. (He's done some great movies and some terrible ones such as this, but his acting is consistently very good.) <br /> <br />At first I thought \\"..the Dead\\" was a satire or parody.  Unfortunately it was neither. It was contrived and not believeable (not a fantasy either).  The acting was terrible except for Crowe and to a lesser extent for Hackman.  The story had no substance, and the drama and suspense were as deep as Jacques Cousteau diving in a wading pool. <br /> <br />Sharon Stone was terrible. (Did she finance this film? It's the only explanation I can think of.) <br /> <br />Even the costuming was comical.  In this dirty, dusty, (and muddy) town some of the attire looked like it came straight off the rack from Saks.  How Sharon got so many clothes on the back of her horse is beyond me! <br /> <br />A leading actor or actress should have at least some quality going for her such as being attractive, strong, sympathetic, mean, intelligent, witty, sexy, ugly, weak, stupid, intriging, something, anything!; Sharon Stone had none in this movie.  Off the top of my head, Sigourney Weaver, a young Sophia Loren or Marilyn Monroe, or even Rosie O'Donnell or Hillary Clinton would be better personalities for the Sharon character. <br /> <br />Hackman was good, but every time he spoke I couldn't help but think of the villian and comical character Lex Luther (from Superman).  The dialogue was very similar.  His character was  contrived and shallow. <br /> <br />DiCaprio was ok given his part, but what's a prissy, GQ, preppy sort of guy, with a perfect complexion doing being the son of of the bad guy in a dirty little town where the average person bathes maybe once a year? And yet despite their relationship, there was no chemistry and little dialogue between them.  Casting DiCaprio in this part is like casting Michael Jackson to play Kobe Byrant in a non-comedy. <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but I'll conclude with two other comments.  The scenes look like they're done on a set, and just one set at that.  And if there are any \\"special effects\\", I must have missed them - except for Hackman doing a backflip! <br /> <br />Oh My, What a Terrible Movie!
0790729628|5.0|I just have to defend this film quickly: as the previous reviewer stated, this was one of the VERY First major movies released on DVD when DVD's were just coming out (1999 I believe), so that is why the transfer is so crappy. It essentially looks like an old VCR dub but on a DVD disc. You can almost consider BR a \\"prototype\\" DVD if you will. The kinks hadn't been worked out yet and the superb technology that companies like MGM, Kino, and Criterion have to restore and do beautiful digital transfers had not yet been mastered. Hopefully WB will give this a new release (like they did Unforgiven and Batman) or maybe it will get the Criterion treatment.
0671015206|1.0|This book gives the reader some good food for thought regarding the benefits of living below one's means and the differences between wealth and materials, but it turns out to be unrealistic. The authors suggest not spending more than twice your income on your home, but in my area - and many others - that is just not possible for the great majority of people. They also continuously discuss the success of small business owners in building wealth, but downplay the fact that most small business owners don't succeed with their businesses. There is also lots of \\"filler\\" material relating to the mathematics of wealth that is just unnecessary and overly drawn out. What is the point of calculating the price of a car by the pound? That certainly isn't the best measure of a cars value and is much less important than safety, reliability, economy, utility and performance.  If you are a doctor, lawyer, or a business owner that likes to spend more money than you make this might be a good eye opener, but this book isn't targeted at the average person and I just didn't find it to be useful.
B0006GAI6Y|3.0|Shall We Dance- surprised me it was far better than, I expected it to be given the fact I'm not much of a Sarandon or Lopez fan. But, Shall We Dance was something I can relate too-<br /><br />John Clark is on of those suburbanites who has been pressing the snooze button throughout his life, he looks sedated and depressed unable to take happiness in the things people tell us to take happiness in. Suddenly when he sees Lopez standing in the window of a dance studio looking the way on the outside as, he feels on inside he decides to take up ballroom dancing classroom. A brief life changing decisions in which he finds new friends, happiness, and a new zest for life. Decidingly John decides to hide this new passion from his family. Only problem is John's wife and daughter have been noticing the late nights at work and his new happiness. Sarandon thinking he is having an affair tracks down a private eye to follow John to only find out he is hiding dancing. Well, Sarandon and her daughter show up at a competition to watch John dance.<br /><br />When this movie finished I felt myself relating to John's new love for dance- for all of us have to find hidden passions for ourselves that make life barable. I was unable to understand why John tried to keep this a secret from his family. I also totally didn't see the connection between him and J-Lo there seemed to be no attraction or friendship between the two.<br /><br />But, what really keeps this movie going is Richard Gere he is so sweet and lovable as John Clark I found myself wanting to hug him as I watch him dance. His little two steps and ballroom dances make this movie well worth watching in his most charming performance since Pretty Woman.<br /><br />All in all rent this movie and ask the person beside you- shall we dance?
B0007Y4USW|4.0|I have to say that I was a bit hesitant about buying this album.  I read several different reviews and decided that, ultimately, I have to let my ears make the final decision.  All in all, this album has to be one of the better ones since her Columbia days, with GLITTER being the absolute worst.  Her voice on this outing seems fuller.  She is belting out the notes like we know she can, as opposed to trying to whisper-breathe all of the lyrics.  On the past couple albums, it seemed that Mariah was afraid to let her voice out or something, and I am frankly glad she is getting over that!  The best songs on this disc are IT'S LIKE THAT and FLY LIKE A BIRD.  If Mariah could always sing like she does on FLY.. there would be no stopping her!  The woman has a great talent, and she should use it.  I deducted a star because she needs to ditch the guest rappers.  She doesn't need them!  Her voice, and her music, stand much better when they are done on their own. I hope this will be the start of many new and exciting things for Ms. Carey. Stay tuned!
0783219733|4.0|This was one of my favorite movies as a kid and now even as an adult I see all the magic that made me enjoy it when I was younger. After watching this movie even the person in your family who is not an animal lover will want to go out and adopt a St.Bernard!<br /><br />It starts when Beethoven is just a puppy by narrowingly escaping a pet store robbery Beethoven wanders the streets until he enters the lives of the Newton family. After Emily Newton the youngest member of the clan awakes in the morning to see a cute little fluffy St. Bernard puppy in her bed \\"I dreamt I had a puppy and my dream came true.\\" George and Alice Newton are besides themselves on what to do with the dog- they can't keep it is George's first reaction. It will ruin the yard, destroy the house, it will grow to be enormous, and then it will die and we'll have to replace it and start the whole process all over again. Well George despite, being an a non-dog person decides to keep it for the sake of the kids \\"It's just temporary\\" he says. But, soon Beethoven the lovable St.Bernard becomes a member of the family- dealing with all childhood crisises from bullies and to first crushes- as this happens he also gets REALLLY big creating huge messes that George Newton reluctantly puts up with! Well, Beethoven is a very special dog with a remarkable love for his family sensing danger for the Newtons from saving George from the finical ruin of his company to the near death drowning of little Emily. But, suddenly Beethoven finds himself in the grips of an villianious vet who wants to use him to test out a new gun anumition on- only problem is the Newton family isn't going to give Beethoven up with out a fight! Even George loves the creature now.<br /><br />This movie made my eleven year old host sister roll over on the floor with laughter. And seeing it made me want to go out and adopt a St.Bernard puppy. Charles Gordin is HILLAROUS as the anti-dog loving George in this movie his facial expressions and tone of voice reminded me of my dad's dealings with our family pet. Charles Gordin totally carries this movie. The animals also make this flick really endearing-<br /><br />All in all this is a movie to rent or buy to watch with your kids over and over again!

B00003CXBK|5.0|This is the probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. True, it is a little gory and bloody, but the plot is amazingly creative and interesting, although a bit confusing. I loved this movie and watched it six times. The characters were well represented and the storyline is very interesting. However I thought the name \\"princess mononoke\\" was kind of corny because it only appears once in the whole show and was probably just used to give it a good and attractive title. this movie is very interesting and good anime, and i would highly recommend it to anyone, although the bloody scenes may not be great for little kids.
0783227434|4.0|I don't know about the specific special release or bonus packages for this movie (so maybe I should be careful how I rate this), but the movie itself is top notch. Unless you're a hardcore afficonado, I'd recommend buying one copy of this movie and leaving it at that.
B000000WCV|5.0|If it's not, then it's gotta be near the top. Daft Punk's Homework is a masterpiece and despite what many people have said, there is NOT a single track on this album that isn't absolute perfection. Around the World, Da Funk, Hi Fidelity, Oh Yeah, Revolution 909, Burnin', Indo Silver Club, Phoenix...classic, classic, classic, classic, etc. Alive is probably my favorite song on the album, blast that song and you will go crazy. And I agree with what Y. Kim says about Rollin' & Scratchin'. Many people think this track blows but honestly this is one of the best songs on the CD, all you need is a little patience to appreciate it.  <br /> <br />This is Daft Punk's best work, by the way...Discovery is almost as good but Homework beats it.
0385513755|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is a stunningly captivating and astoundingly well written novel. Robert Langdon, Sophie Nevue, Leigh Teabing, and the multitude of other characters appear to be truly existent and not simply wavering apparitions. As the journey unfolds, the pages of your book seem no longer like pages, but corridors, the letters become the figures moving around you. The theories, so carefully constructed, become reality. This epic tale will immerse your every being in, and encompass you in a sense of realism I have yet to find in any book, article, short story, or any piece of literature I have read thus far.<br /><br />  Robert Langdon, an American symbologyst is attending a conference in France. Little does he know that what is about to happen will change his life; his very soul forever. A man named Jacques Sauniere invites him to dinner. Jacques Sauniere is the curator of the world renowned Lovoure art museum. Sauniere never shows up to dinner. Langdon soon finds out that Sauniere has been the victim of a grisly murder. Stripped naked, spread across the floor on his back with a bloody pentacle traced on his chest. Captain Bezu Fache heads the investigation to find Sauniere's murderer. His unknowing suspect is Langdon. Through a mist of clues and double meanings, Langdon flees with his counter part Sophie Nevue. They race not only to save themselves, but to reveal to the world several truths which would incinerate the Christian churches over night, but would liberate the souls of innocents killed. They must also fear and elude the servants of the church. The members of Opus Dei, a radical antidisestablishmentarianistically motivated group will stop at nothing to prevent the truth from coming out. History is not what it is perceived to be and the future is even less certain. With forces closing in like walls from all sides, this race for truth is truly a race against time, which will lead to a final plot twist so immense and unanticipatable, it will leave you dumbfounded and possibly confused. A truth will be revealed that could never have been thought possible before.<br /><br />  The realism presented alongside the theories in this book combines to form a series of new ideas that bend the passages of what we know. Whether or not these theories are true is irrelevant. The realism, accuracy, and tedious attention to detail that has been applied to this book is unmatched by anything I have yet read. This book was a very quick read, not because of a low page number or low difficulty level, but because of the difficulty I found in putting it down. As pages become corridors, and letters become figures, and as you become enveloped in the story; it becomes real. Slowly the mist subsides, the letters are letters and the pages are pages. You wish you can go back to when the book was unread, but you know you can not. By remembering the books theories however, you may walk those corridors once more.umbfounded and possibly confused.

6304698798|5.0|When I saw this, I had to wonder if it was supposed to be a Western movie or a spoof of Western movies.  After all, shooting the hangman's rope does seem more than a little silly.  And so do many of the other scenes.  But it is a real Western; the music by Ennio Morricone is excellent, and the acting is superb.<br /><br />It is a long movie, and this is definitely the long version.  But it's worth it.
B0008JFMEC|2.0|Some people are going to buy a 512MB or 1gig memory stick and download movies thru a p2p. Yes you have to encode the movie to mpeg4, but there are encoders available for free for the psp savvy that will bother to find them and they are not hard to find. In fact this downloadable feature could backfire on the umd. Now I am willing to buy the umds because I'm a collector, a fan of the box art and the entire package. But $13-$15 is about right. $20 and up is out of the question considering the unit's main function is games. I can't see paying $30 for a disk that is for me, a secondary function. I'm saving that money for the games.
B00005U8EM|5.0|How would you like to live the same day over and over?  Well, for some of us, it feels that way occasionally.  But in this fantasy, our hero does just that.  He keeps living the same day over again, trying different things each time, learning from his mistakes, and getting more and more talented.  It's a great concept for a movie, and it is a great comedy.<br /><br />One minor change I would have made in the movie is this: I would have had some indicator so the audience would know just how many times our hero had gone through the day.  Early in the movie, that number might read 1, then 2, then 3.  But later, it might be a hilariously large number.<br /><br />Now, is there a profound concept behind all this?  Um, I don't think so.  If I had to live through thousands of similar days, would I try to get better at music or art?  Maybe!  And sooner or later, I might start phoning up all sorts of scientists, find out what theoretical problems they were working on, and, eventually, solve them.  After that, I'd be phoning those scientists to tell them the answers to their problems, on the spot.  I'd also be finding a way to do all sorts of computer searches each day, systematically looking for needle-in-haystack kinds of solutions to problems.  Eventually, I'd find some interesting stuff.  And it would be easy to prepare an absolutely unbelievable chess opening book (although one would have to memorize it).  Oh, there is plenty even one person could accomplish, given enough time.  If you watch this movie, you'll find that you'll wonder about what you might do with so many chances to live a day over and over.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Since other reviewer's have already defined the good, bad and ugly of this film, all that is left for me to say is that I enjoyed it and thought it good fun. The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed and shot. Just enough \\"humor\\" injected into them to take the edge off the brutality and add that little touch of \\"tongue in cheek\\" that QT is becoming famous for. <br />Like Sam Pekinpah's movies, QT's seem to fall into two catagories, either ya love em or ya hate em. Not much middle ground. Good movie, worth watching more than once. Recommend this one.
B00003CWNR|4.0|The Cider House Rules is a compelling film for the very reason that other posters have dismissed it.  Its characters are human in that they are fallable.  All of the characters are tainted in some way or another by their own actions.  <br />The story follows Homer (Tobey Magiure) on his journey discovering himself outside the orphanage in which he was raised.  Dr. Larch (Michael Caine) is an ether addicted, abortion performing doctor who also runs the orphanage.  Dr. Larch has taught Homer everything he knows and would like for Homer to be his successor at the orphanage.  Homer has never attended Medical School, but Dr. Larch has and insists since he has imparted all his knowledge to Homer that Homer must too be qualified.  Homer has other ideas. <br />Homer leaves the orphanage with a young man and his girlfriend who have come to the orphanage to engage Dr. Larch's services.  He sees it as a chance to see the world, and he does, to a degree.  He sees two things of note: the ocean and beautiful Charlize Theron.  He begins an affair with her while her boyfriend is at war and works picking apples for cider.   <br />The characters here are all wonderfully developed except for the orphans and all of the characters are tainted by some deed they have done.  Dr. Larch has many vices, and Delroy Lindo plays a father guilty of incest, Homer falls in love with his friend's girlfriend, and vice versa.  But these characters are never absolved for their sins.  They are never forgiven.  They either have to live knowing what they have done or die with the knowledge that they cannot change it.   <br />There are pieces of this film that are too sweet to mix with the dark tone hovering over it.  The feel good ending nearly takes the bad taste out of your mouth, which would be tragic, because th epoint of the story is that all of us have done something to make us ashamed.  We are just normal people capable of unforgivable acts, and these mistakes will shape our lives and guide them toour deaths.  It is a bitter pill to swallow, which is probably why the filmmakers coated with sugar and gave it the feel good ending.  But all in all it is a very good film with characters rich and real enough to make us care what happens to them, even we hate them for what they have done.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Usually sequels leave a lot to be desired, but this one got it right. Most of  the questions left over from Vol 1 were answered, including my favorite, What happened to Elle's eye? I knew there was a good story there, and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Since most of the technical praise has already been given by other reviewer's, and much better than I could, let me just say that I thought the actor's, all of them, gave outstanding performance's. It's too bad the Academy doesn't award movies that were just meant to entertain. This is a very good movie, well worth watching... but you have to put your serious side in the closet for awhile. Highly recommend this film and Vol 1.
B0007P3582|1.0|I've got nearly 300 hip hop cds from old school new school and underground so I have alot to compare this cd too. And the fact that this cd even sold 100 copies is just sad. 50 is and has always been hot beats over lazy hooks.  And now that Dre did only 2 beats it shows.  <br /> <br />The only thing sellin his albumn is his image, which means nothing to me. His diss track \\"Piggy Bank\\" is hot not because of what is said but who hes dissin.  I mean seriously are you gonna put 50 in the same \\"hemisphere\\" as Nas and Jada. Disco Inferno and Candy Shop is jus something to play in the clubs tap your feet to and move on.   <br /> <br />The funniest thing about this albumn is that hes singing throughout the cd when he was getting at Ja Rule for doing the same thing. I don't like both of them but I prefer Ja's singing over 50 if I had to choose.  Don't let me get started on some of his other tracks like \\"Ghatman and Robin\\". Get Rich or Die Trying was officail but that was then this is now. The only hot songs on this Lp were \\"My Hood\\" and \\"Hate It or Love It remix\\". I took time out of my day to tell you whats really poppin. Go buy a Mobb Deep or Jay Z cd or something. Pleaaaaassssse!!!!!!!!
B00000K19E|5.0|Well, to start this off, I have to say that the Matrix <br /> <br />&lt;marquee>WAS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!!&lt;/marquee> <br /> <br />The plot to this is the strongest I have ever seen in a movie, and the whole concept of \\"the matrix\\" is truly amazing and original: basically our conciousness, this reality, isn't real. It's artificial. We are really in some tube somewhere, being used by machines as energy sources. You see that computer screen in front of you? It's not real. <br /> <br />While this movie is rated R, I don't think it should be. PG-13, yes, but R?! For action violence? Really. There ARE A lot of guns and action, but not enough to really get it it's rating. <br /> <br />I have to say this made my personal all time best list. I would strongly suggest renting this, if not simply purchasing it.
B000286RKW|5.0|Without a doubt, this is probably one of THE definitive mafia movies in cinematic history.  I put this on a different level than \\"The Godfather\\", only because this is actually based on a true story where the Godfather is fictional, However, I intend no disrespect to the Godfather (lest I get whacked LOL).    <br /> <br />What makes this special edition DVD so awesome is the special \\"narration\\" versions of the movie which features Henry Hill and Ed McDonald (the agent who got Henry into the Witness protection program).  They basically talk over the entire movie about the things that happened in each scene  and how true they were and what really went on.  That alone was worth the price of the this DVD, I highly recommend it!!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Definetly a easy 5 star.  If you dont believe me listen too it entirely without interupption and you will be *enlightened*.  The opening \\"sarcophagi\\" portrays a powerful beginning just like \\"son et Lumiere\\" in de-Loused.  Definetly not as listenable as de-loused or tremulent but amazing none-the-less
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Even though I thought Sean Penn did an excellent job in \\"Mysic River,\\" it's a shame that he and Bill Murray couldn't have shared the Best Actor Oscar that year. Murray gives the best performance of his career in \\"Lost in Translation\\" as Bob Harris, a middle-aged actor who's stuck doing whiskey commercials in Tokyo. Bob is bitter about the fact that he decided to go for the easy money in Japan instead of doing something more rewarding for his career, like a play. During his stay at a Tokyo hotel, Harris befriends Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a 25-year-old girl who's just as lost as he is. Charlotte is in Tokyo with her photographer husband who has no time to spend with her. Despite their age difference, Bob and Charlotte share a connection unlike anything either of them have experienced before. \\"Lost in Translation\\" is a beautiful almost-romance about two people who are very different in some ways but soul mates in a world of their own. Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this beautiful movie, and Murray and Johansson both give exceptional performances. This is definitely a must-see film.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I will admit to giving up on Mariah over the last few years..I just wasn't feeling her anymore.  So when my sister told me her new project was slammin'...I was skeptical.  To prove it, she let me borrow her copy and I only needed to listen to it once.  I immediately knew, I wanted to purchase my own copy!<br /><br />Her CD will pull you in and hook you! Its like hot flowing liquid lava and cool refreshing spring water co-existing  on a musical island!  She gives you some booty-shaking, pulsating, thundering, snap your head back, down in the gutter beats..and then she lifts you up and carries you over the arc of the rainbow with her soft, powerful, angelic octave on other fierce songs!  I don't believe it is necessary to break the CD down song by song because each one is worthy and easy to listen to! I enjoy the entire project, not just pieces of it!<br /><br />I must give Ms. Carey her props...because she came back with hollow tip, piercing vocals and guns blazin'...good for her!
B000294SFW|5.0|Compare Motorhead with Metallica since 1991:  Metallica had studio albums in 91, 96 (Load and Reload were from the same sessions), 98 (Garage Inc. was old and new), and St. Anger from last year (puke).  That's it.  Motorhead had studio albums in 91,92,93,95,96,98,00,02,and 04.  They also had a great live album in 99.  Each one of those albums rock - better than anything else out there.  It's a CRIME that this band doesn't get the respect it deserves.  Inferno is their all time best work.  And I know my Motorhead - all the way back to 1975.Go do yourself a favor and \\"discover\\" this band.  Take your time.  Then one day it will hit you like a ton of bricks.  You'll say to yourself: \\"These guys really are the best!  Nobody can out play them.\\"  Lemmy will tell you why:  It's because Motorhead is a blues band.  Without the blues, hard rock is flavorless.  Motorhead has the hardest flavor of anyone.     <br />

B0007OCG4W|1.0|After the ads I had seen with that great romantic song, I was expecting this movie to be a romance. Boy was I wrong! It's the opposite of romantic. If you want to watch four very beautiful people do ugly things to each other, this is the movie for you. With no character development and random clips strung together, it's really hard to generate suspension of disbelief for most of the plot (such as it is) like...photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) hooks up with a guy who thinks he had e-sex with her on an internet porn site(Eew!), then leaves him to get together with her stalker. Hey, it could happen.
B0002EXH5O|4.0|if its possible that there is anybody that hasnt heard megadeth before,for these people i write this review <br />for the most part,megadeth sucks.they where always regarded as one of the super powers,along with metallica,anthrax(which suck also),and the much much superior slayer,in the thrash genre. <br />this particular album,however,doesnt suck.some of the riffs are actually pretty cool and heavy.mustaines vocals are still unbearably whiny,but the music is pretty strong. <br />so,if you are wanting to check them out start and end here. <br />the 4 star rating is taking into account we are talking about megadeth.under any other name it would be 3.0/3.5 stars
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Sometimes there truly is a diamond in the rough!  This CD has some of the most beautiful harmonies and chord changes of any CD this year.  I would place Arcade Fire into a wide category of musicians, including Flaming Lips, Wilco, Modest Mouse, perhaps some Ween. Individuals from the group had just lost some loved ones, and \\"Funeral\\" is a tribute to them...and what a magnificent tribute.  From the CD cover, it's hard to tell how many individuals are actually in this group, but the music, lyrics, and singing indicate very creative energy gathered together.  The dramatic voice may be more powerful than some of the lyrics;  my heart swelled with \\"Then, we tried to name our babies; but we forgot all the names that we used to know\\". Why?...the power of that voice and the accompanying music.  \\"Funeral\\" blends in gloriously with those obscure CD's that appear to be the beginning of continuing creative genius.  Please, no more death, but many more CD's.  Thank you, Arcade Fire!
B00005JMUA|5.0|This movie does not have all the action in it but it does have some which is great plus if there was more fight scenes the movie wouldn't have made much sense so they did a great job by adding more story to this great movie.

B000001F9E|5.0|Most would credit those such as Elvis(obvious), the Stones, Beatles, & Van Halen as being the best of all time. They may have been great, but I have news for the world in 2005! I, myself, obtained my first copy of Jailbreak at age 25(2001) & while I was brainwashed most of my life by just commercially known outfits, I was born again and saw the light with Thin Lizzy and the late(1/4/86), greatest Phil Lynott. We all know \\"The Boys Are Back In Town, but this is just the beginning. While Downey, Gorham, & Robertson fit the mold of the long haired, blonde stereotyped looking rock star, Philip Parris Lynott of Irish-Brazilian dark & curly haired decent was a legend & (Black Rose) to look up too. How ironic after all this time that this one was the best all this time*
B00005R2M3|4.0|It's the first CD of Shakira that I've bought. <br /> <br />She's a true artist, she writes and composes her songs, she sings really good, she's an engaged singer. <br /> <br />I put only 4 stars because there are not many songs (only 10 original songs) and that it's not as good as her older CDs in Spanish. <br /> <br />But it's a great CD, all the songs are different, sometimes rock, sometimes pop, sometimes arabic. <br />Good purchase.
B0007O38F8|5.0|Even if you don't like the words that much, almost every single track on here has a hot beat. Really, I love rap as much as the next guy and it's about the beats. There's only so many times and way you can talk about money, cars, and sex. It's gotta have a hot beat and The Massacre sure does accomplish this.  <br /> <br />Gatman and Robin is one stupid song but it's super hyper beat is cool. My personal favorite changes from day to day depending on my mood. It's that kind of mix that no matter how you are feeling, it has a song to get you going.  <br /> <br />Just a Lil Bit has a super nice beat and the words make you wanna roll down your window and ride with a gangsta lean!  <br /> <br />Everyone's heard Candy Shop and it's good but overplayed. It gets old. There's plenty of fresh stuff on here for you to listen to. I had my doubts about 50 but like all good rappers, they never let you down and he sure doesn't. If you like Get Rich, BUY THIS NOW. If you didn't like it, you probably won't like this one. His style is the same but the beats on this one is sicker than Hell. It's worth every penny.
B000002BQK|4.0|Mariah Carey's Butterfly took off because of the many singles and standouts.  Not quite a classic, but damn near.  As she continues to dazzle us with her range.  \\"My All\\" was just that for myself with the production and Mariah showing off her strengths on a slow jam.  That leads me right to the Prince remake of \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" featuring Dru Hill.  Usually remakes don't compare, but together they may have beaten its originator's version.  She got a little more outside help to attain a more harder/hip-hop feel on \\"Breakdown\\" featuring Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and \\"The Roof\\".  The instrumental feel of a live band on \\"Fourth Of July\\" made it even more fireworks fly.  \\"Close My Eyes\\" sounds like it could have been featured on a movie transferring its feel to a silent part and or scene.  This release by Mariah should have been entitled Breathtaking!
1592246087|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.k it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|The music scene nowadays is very disappointing.  There is hardly anything out there that is worth buying anymore.  It is very rare that a band comes out that actually impresses me.  Avenged Sevenfold has done just that.   <br /> <br />I can't get over just how great this band is.  They combine elements in rock and metal music to create an assault of razor sharp riffs within a massive wall of sound.  The guitarists are the main players on this record.  They demonstrate their solo skills with perfection.  The lead work is a force to be reckoned with.  The song writing is also very interesting.  You'll be jamming to an almost black metal assualt of vocals and guitars and it will suddenly turn into a disco beat (Eternal Rest).  A lot of these songs hit the six minute mark, but always remain interesting and fun.  Do yourself a favor and check these guys out.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah has found the formula.  People have spoken poorly of her most recent studio releases (Charmbracelet and Glitter (bad movie, great album)), but no one will be able to ignore that Mariah Carey is back. <br />Not only has Ms. Carey returned to us stronger than ever, but with a wonderful mix of the mid-tempo, ballad, and club-bangers.  Urban and honest, Emancipation has Mariah leaving lovers and returning to love too-soon forsaken, eschewing drama for a good time and taking us through all the permutations of her love.  <br />Mariah has distilled all the major aspects of her recording career into one studio album that any Mariah fan is sure to love intimately.
B00003CWNR|2.0|Unlike some of the viewers here, I found the plot, characters and acting were all executed well. I haven't read the book, but it seems that Irving has cut down on the eccentricities that mar his other works (with the small exception of naming a character \\"Rose Rose\\"). However, the themes of abortion and incest which run through the film are very harrowing and difficult to watch. I can't believe this didn't get a R rating --this is NOT a movie for young ones. <br /> <br />However, I found the morality of the film problematic. This goes way beyond the issue of abortion, whatever your stance on it. The message of the film seems to be that the ends always justify the means. This is totally epitomised by Michael Caine's Dr. Larch. Whether engaging in illegal abortions, forgery, falsifying records or substance abuse, it seems that this guy thinks that anything is OK as long as he gets the results that he wants. In the end, young Homer does become his successor to this kind of life. This is held up as heroic, somehow, when it is actually tragic.  <br /> <br />This aspect of the film is the most problematic for me -- the total lack of a moral and ethical center. For this reason, I'm not sure that I would recommend the film, but it can certainly spark a lot of discussion if viewed with a lot of discernment and if you don't fall for its false heroics.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|What can I say about Absolution? Well I bought it three days ago and I can't stop listening to it. I listen to the whole CD about ten times so far everyday. I live in Nashville and when they came to town a couple of months ago, the tickets for the show were sold out in like a hour. I was so disappointed when I heard it was sold out cause I didn't get to go. <br /> <br />There music is just one of a kind. Soft and slow music to hard alt. music. There isn't much to say but WOW and everyone needs to get there CD and give them a chance. Listen to the whole CD and I bet you that you will atleast like five songs or more or even the whole CD. Take the time and listen to it all.
B000002MP2|5.0|I'm tired of how everyone is always puttin down Green Day. Just because they signed with a major label doesn't mean they sold out. Sure, they might not be that original, but I think they're pretty talented musicians nonetheless. Just because you don't like a certain type of music, doesn't mean you have the right to say it sucks. Different people like different music, not everyone's alike. I'm also sick of how people are always writing reviews without getting their facts straight first or basing them on other people's reviews without checking it out firsthand. How many times do I have to say this, the lead singer is not trying to imitate an English accent, that's just the way he sings. He's always sang that way, ever since he was a kid. If you don't like how he sounds then that's your problem, but don't go around giving people the wrong ideas about a band you're not even that sure about. Also there are many different types of Punk, it's not just based on one specific style. In fact, I thought the whole idea of Punk was to be an indivisual and not care about what anyone else thinks of you. This is Green Day's main attitude towards life on and off the stage so even if alot of their songs aren't exactly traditional punk, they're still punks themselves. Heck, they even wrote a song for their new album in memory of Johnny Ramone (It's called 'Wake Me Up When September Ends')and just so you know, I happen to be a very big Punk Rock fan and I think it has already been killed by bands like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan. Wow, that was the longest review I ever wrote. Come to think of it, it wasn't a review at all. Anyway, I have all the Green Day CDs and I think that 'Dookie' and 'American Idiot' are the two best ones they've ever made. Oh by the way, 'American Idiot' is the most original CD they've ever made(I'd advise you to get that one too).
B00005NWM3|4.0|first track is a killer-eye opener. second track to the end keeps the rock flowing. buy it, listen to it, feel the intensity and emotion of this timeless album
B0000041DF|5.0|Wow, after all the superlatives expressed and accolades showered on this CD by so many reviewers, I'm not sure I can add anything else but I'll try.  I just want to share simply how I felt about it although I'm not a strictly classical music person.  <br /> <br />When I first heard this CD, I ask myself what's all the fuss and hype was about.  What's with the great reviews and even personal comments I've heard like \\"this is awesome, man!\\" - this coming from a total stranger who saw me buying it in the music shop.  The Rach 2 I've heard and loved, but I've never came across the Rach 3 before in all my 50 years.  My immediate reaction on hearing the CD on a modest hi-fi set-up was pure disappointment.  Initial impression I get is that the Rach 3 sound like a mangled mess of musical notes, filled with seemingly loud, meandering and unmelodic banging on the piano.  It seemed someone possessed, even mad was playing the music!  Frankly, I don't know what to make out of the music, of what it was all about, particularly why it has been described as romantic when it doesn't evoke the slightest bit of romanticism in me.  I considered the experience one mainly of confusion and the music a lot of \\"sound and fury signifying nothing\\". <br /> <br />Feeling dissatisfied and frustrated after listening to the CD a couple of times, I borrowed the high-end audio system of a friend and played this CD again late one night.  This was then that I got a \\"revelation\\" of the Rach 3.  What beauty, what passion, what wonder that lies in this piece of music!  How thrilling, exciting, exhilarating the performance was.  To me, it was like I was standing in the conductor's rostrum, listening to every beautiful note, every captivating sound, coming from both the piano and the orchestra.   I can feel the atmosphere of the concert hall as the music float, soar and swirl into space.  Musical notes upon musical notes produced by a pair of magical hands was coming out fast and furious - the high and low,soft and loud, slow and fast, simple and complex, harmonious and discordant, converging and diverging, agitated and soothing etc.  Everything was full, rich, detailed and warm.  Overall, it was all moving, evocative, and passionate.  I was transfixed, fascinated, mesmerised by the music - or possessed by it if you will.  I could not pull myself away until the very end of the concerto, until the final climax, until the last note has died away.  With no offence meant, the experience wasn't so much like a wild orgy, as someone described it, but more like great love making with an earth moving climax.  Or put another way, the music invokes in me the sense of great and mighty rushes of water flowing down a mountain relentlessly and inexorably to its final destination, culminating in a awesome waterfall (Niagara?) - all these remind me of  human passions sometimes.  Interspersed in between are the swirls and twirls of whirlpools and undercurrents, as well as quiet moments of tranquillity, peace and reflection.  Now I can understand why some people find classical music so addictive and all consuming.  This is what great music is and should be - music that touch, move, inspire and communicate with the listener.   <br /> <br />I believe this experience was possible mainly because Martha Argerich is such a consummate yet sensitive master at the piano. Only performers like her appear to disappear into the performance and let the music come to life.  Virtuoso performers who have big egos and think too highly of themselves tend to draw attention to themselves (see how great I am!) rather than to the music. I find their performances tend to be technical, cold, distant and uninvolving (regardless of how brilliant some think they are) betraying hints of aloofness, disdain, indifference to and even contempt for the music that's being played.  Not so here.  Here, the music comes through loud and clear to make direct contact with us at the right places, the heart first and then the mind.  <br /> <br />Since then, I have listened to about fifteen other recordings of the Rach 3 by great artiste like Horowitz/Reiner/RCA/1951, Janis/Dorati/LSO/Mercury/1958.   Some may be technically brilliant but leave me cold, disinterested and bored.  These tend to emphasise more about the virtuosity/virtuoso than the musicality/music as mentioned earlier.  This CD is neither the greatest nor the best but it is among the top 3 and is a MUST BUY.  Get this and also the one by Byron Janis.  Together, they form an ideal collection, offering comparisons and contrasts - one is a live performance the other is not, one is by a man and the other a woman, one approaches the music in a relatively more noble, controlled manner the other more in a free and abandon-like manner etc.  Both are superb even if Byron Janis is the better, in my opinion. <br /> <br />Lastly, one word of \\"caution\\" - do not listen to the Tchaikovsky Concerto immediately after the Rachmaninoff on this CD.  Don't be mistaken; the Tch 1 is also one of the best around, although it is not as good as the Rach 3 in terms of recording, not performance.  This Tchaikovsky is also an ideal addition to that by Van Cliburn/Kondrasin/RCA/1958.  It is just that immediately after feasting at say a grand Chinese banquet, I can guarantee that you will be too satiated to enjoy a grand Japanese banquet next.  The Rach 3 will still be swirling inside you such that the Tch 1 will appear relatively bland and flat!  So space things out and slowly savour and enjoy the quite different experiences! <br />

0714834491|5.0|This book is essentially a very inteligent scrapbook.  <br />It is amazingly researched, apparently a lifetimes worth of storing away snippits of information, quotations and facts. <br /> <br />Fantastic to dip into, I keep my copy on a shelf in the bathroom and often find myself staying in there a bit longer than I ought to. And this is the ultimate toilet book. Not challenging but insightful, friendly, very well designed, satisfying, very long (it'll last years of daily use), uplifting and it also atempts to change your perceptions. <br />Personally, because of this book I now face backwards in trains as the view dosn't race past. It is such small things as this that makes this book enjoyable.
0064407667|5.0|The world we live in has vast amounts of tragedy in it and unfortunately we encounter lots of nasty characters who might try to do us harm. My criticism of Snicket, and I think it is a strength of the tale as well, is that the story stresses that the Baudelaires have only each other. The children are constantly dismissed when they reach out to adults for assistance, even as their lives are at stake. They are gradually learning (it seems it will become a theme in the series) to not trust others, and the others are always adults. For me, as a young adult it is heartbreaking to realize that children should not reach for help from strange adults, and they must quickly develop the ingenuity to save their own skins in case you might not be their to help them (as the Baudelaire's parents died), or even more tragically, if you ignore them yourself. <br /> <br />While I would like to see fiction foster a world that is always ready to greet children with warm rooms and adults who are excited to learn from them I know that is not representative of the world we live in. So while I wish The Bad Beginning gave us one competent adult who didn't dismiss the children, that is not the case, especially in the welfare system, which is where the Baudelaires find themselves. <br /> <br />One appreciates how Snicket's tales illustrate the sanctuary children have when they defend each other, and actually risk their own lives to help the group. What is also fantastic is the Baudelaires do not act on a whim - Violet (hurray its a girl character) is very interested in science and engineering and she logically invents contraptions that get them out of jams while Klaus's photographic memory retains random pieces of knowledge to help get the plans off the ground. <br /> <br />The Baudelaires camaraderie is refreshing and in a way it exists already in the rebelliousness of youth - how we refuse to get each other in trouble - we'll all take detention rather than rat someone out, the substitute teacher is the common enemy. But wouldn't it be fantastic if it didn't disappear into our adulthood? Then Snicket wouldn't have to tell us the nightmarish tale of the Baudelaires. Because the first adult to hear their story would have put a stop to the anguish they were facing and brought them into fantastic home to nurture Violet's inventions, Klaus's reading, and baby Sunny's biting.
B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers' \\"Hot Fuss\\" is definitely a solid rock album that, while not exactly standing out in the indie/new-wave/dancy/fashion/punk/quirky/garage rock wave, definitely hold its own.  There are at least 5 great songs (Smile Like You Mean It, Mr. Brightside, Somebody Told Me, Change Your Mind, Believe Me Natalie) that I dare you not to start singing, or at least humming' along with.  Yet, this is not to say that the rest too be discarded.  I often listen to it straight through with pleasure (execpt for maybe the last song), which is an achievement in itself.   <br /> <br />But I wouldn't be surprised if the emergence of The Killers marks the point of critical mass where this (uh, kind of) new type of rock, that burst out with The Strokes and The White Stripes, stopped \\"emerging\\" and started forming a bubble. Bubbles eventually collapse, and someday all those cool new bands will be forgotten.  No doubt, there will be more good albums and good bands to emerge from this niche of rock, but oversaturation is taking place.  Will the Killers, along with Franz Ferdinand (the only sure bet) be left standing?  Maybe, \\"Hot Fuss\\" is certainly a good first step. <br />
0375422307|5.0|Satrapi's parents were radicals who fostered a deep sense of curiosity and independence in their daughter. She is deeply inspired and concerned for their safety as her parents protest together in the streets of Tehran and host parties with Communist leaders in the student movements. In the battle for ideology God wins out each time Satrapi overhears of the the Shah's army killing protesters, or when her friends tell her their fathers are away on a trip - something the children tragically discover means the men were executed. When tragedy strikes her own family Satrapi has her final vision of God. She banishes him from her dreams screaming he does not exist. \\"Get out of my life!\\" she shouts at God. <br /> <br />Satrapi's deeply inquisitive childhood complements the history of Iran, a small chapter of that history is a second narrative in Persepolis. The book was named for a noted city-center in Persia, the city of Persepolis was founded around 500 BC. Many texts were discovered at Persepolis documenting hundreds of years of Persian history before the city's founding as well as many volumes of Persian poetry.  <br /> <br />It is not right to gloss over 1,000 years of history but Iran remained distinctly Persian throughout numerous Arab invasions and the expansion of the Ottoman Empire in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries - I have even heard that Persian influence was evident in languages as far west as Austria a few hundred years later. Because of such preservation of Persian language and identity a strong nationalist history survived in unique poetry and history texts - like some of the most ancient that resided at Persepolis. <br /> <br />Persepolis radiates this legacy. Satrapi's remembrances both offer the reader with a history lesson missing in my American generation as well as a firecracker of a girl's take on events. The memoir radiates literary tradition distinct to the region, not only in Satrapi's writing but also in her stark black and white illustrations that portray our heroine even more warm and endearing than you could imagine a photo to be. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|Ever since the bloated, over-hyped album that was \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", I've been awaiting a new U2 album with mixed feelings: now that the previous album re-established them as a credible force (especially live on the excellent Elevation tour), would they repeat the formula? Three or four decent songs (including one that was so overplayed as to become irrelevant) with a bunch of filler? Uh-oh, they scrapped the original sessions with Chris Thomas...can that be good? Even the reviews from magazines like Blender deeming \\"A Man and a Woman\\" as \\"Motown soul\\", or the album as their \\"best yet\\". Yeah, we heard all that before, and that album was not so great. <br />The fellas at mags like Rolling Stone probably looked like fools when this album was dropped: they already claimed ATYCLB was U2's third masterpiece, they can't change their mind now and deem this the real third masterpiece! Because as a long-time U2 fan, I can say that this is easily their best effort since \\"Achtung Baby\\" (not to knock on the sublime \\"Zooropa\\" or the lyrical genius of \\"Pop\\") and quite possibly U2's third masterpiece. Whatever pretense you might have, you cannot argue that U2 bring serious melody and hooks on this album, and at least five of these songs stand up with their very best: a high compliment for a band of their ouerve.  <br />Some reviews will knock U2 for making the songs \\"boring\\", but I don't see that: sure, there isn't as much fire in their bellies as 21 years ago on \\"War\\", but can you expect that? The boys are beyond millionaires, they're rock royalty, and any move they make will be adored by everyone. Bono donates a chunk of his time to fighting AIDS first-hand, you can't expect too much of his activism to seep into his music. After all, U2 is a rock and roll band: the music has to be entertaining to sell and keep Bono in the spotlight with enough credibility to promote his causes. I couldn't be happier with this album: anytime a band in its third decade can releasetheir 13th album and claim it as one of their very best, it is a special band you are talking about. That band is U2.
B0008JFMEC|5.0|Shop around and find a good price, its not hard, with a brand new format that is just getting off the ground I don't think $20 is highway robbery. I remember the days when DVDs cost a lot more than they do today, once the market picks up steam and PSPs become more prevalent prices will go ever lower.<br /><br />I picked Kill Bill up today and I love it. The transfer is flawless, the action is so crisp and clean on PSP its just beautiful, even in the middle of the craziest action, no artifacting in sight. The audio is excellent as well. I can copy movies onto a memory stick but they won't hold a candle to this in terms of anything.<br /><br />This is very well done UMD: nice animated menus, subtitles, scene selections, a \\"Making Of\\" video as well as some music videos by the 5,6,7,8's. An excellent addition to your PSP collection!
B0006U4UAU|4.0|After years of hyping DFA Records through noted production work and several classic singles, James Murphy finally decided to put his money where his mouth is and release an LCD Soundsystem album to the masses. Kudos to him for adding a bonus second disc with the amazing early singles: that disc alone makes this an essential purchase. As a matter of fact, if the second disc wasn't included, this would be a rather underwhelming and ultimately disappointing purchase. The new material cannot hold a candle to the old songs as of yet, and I highly doubt any of the nine songs ever will. \\"Daft Punk is Playing at My House\\" and \\"Never as Tired as When I'm Waking Up\\" are the two best songs on the first disc, but they pale compared to \\"Yeah\\" or \\"Losing My Edge\\". If ever there's two discs to play on their own merits and not compare to the other ones, it's this collection by LCD. One of the year's best so far, but hardly for all the right reasons.
B000031WD9|5.0|Nominated for zero Academy Awards, American Pie is a lewd, crude teenage comedy that's probably the funniest movie of 1999. In the tradition of Animal House, Fast Times At Ridgemont High, and other such comedies, the film makes its mark as one of the better written screenplays in the genre. The clever one-liners and memorable scenes are so abundant that few seconds of the film lack one or the other. If you can't laugh at American Pie, then you've got serious problems. Along with Office Space and There's Something About Mary, it's one of the best comedies of its time... <br /> <br />Jason Biggs plays the role of Jim Levenstein a normal high school student in American suburbia. Together with his friends Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), he makes a pact to lose his virginity by prom night. Seeing that it's senior year, the task calls for immediate attention, and the four friends find that it's not as easy as they had originally planned. <br /> <br />Kevin's task seems to be the easiest as he is involved with long-time girlfriend Vicky Lathum (Tara Reid). Meanwhile, Chris joins the chorus (discovering he has an unknown talent off the lacrosse field) where he falls for Heather (Mena Suvari) who initially wants nothing to do with him. Finch relies on self-perpetuated rumors to make his personal stock rise, while Jim comes close to doing the deed with the beautiful foreign exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). When Nadia is sent home, Jim's hopes rest on band camp survivor Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan). As prom night closes in, each must determine his own fate, while wondering what the final outcome was for his friend... <br /> <br />In American Pie, Eugene Levy steals the show as Jim's father. His monotone, straight-forward attempts to be hip and to befriend his son are gut-busting in nature. His feeble attempts to explain sex and his encounter with Jim and the pie in the kitchen are some of the funniest scenes in the movie. That's saying a lot, because American Pie is a hilarious movie with lots of buzz words like \\"M.I.L.F.\\" and quirky characters like Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott). That said, only a certain age demographic will find American Pie to be among their film favorites. <br /> <br />Scenes such as the Internet cam with Jim and Nadia will be forever famous, and the movie lacks any sort of a slowdown. From beginning to end, the laughs are truly non-stop. Following its release, American Pie became an instant cult classic, influencing its target generation and pioneering the depths of the young adult vocabulary. Because of its utterly hilarious scenes and prominent role in the teenage comedy genre, American Pie ranks as a definite must-see movie... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00005N919|5.0|Basic Instinct is a guilty pleasure. I love this film, and have had the Unrated Director's Cut on VHS for many years. I bought the so-called Collector's Edition (included the ice pick pen) a while back and returned it because it missed quite a bit of footage. Recently, I tried again---and this time it was ice pick bingo! (Who needs the pen, anyway?) The Unrated Director's Cut is listed on Amazon as an unrated special edition (Special Edition - Unrated) which \\"contains scenes the director was forced to cut.\\" There is no image available. You can identify the DVD as Artisan's release, ASIN B00005N919. Make no mistake, THIS IS THE VERSION TO BUY. I also highly recommend the soundtrack on compact disc. Jerry Goldsmith's music is haunting, and one of the best scores ever composed for film.
0783219695|5.0|Nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture, Apollo 13 is one of the best movies of its decade. Despite prior knowledge of the historical outcome, it's guaranteed to keep viewers steeped in suspense. Director Ron Howard creates yet another fantastic picture, solidifying his transformation from Mayberry's favorite son on Andy Griffith to one of the most accomplished director/producers in all of Hollywood. Standout performances by Gary Sinise and Tom Hanks (on the heels of their Oscar-caliber portrayals from Forrest Gump) make Apollo 13 especially enticing to the movie connoisseur. Based on the true story of the Apollo 13 mission, the film stirs emotions of all types - hope, fear, and patriotism among them. In the end, it's one of those rare movies where the characters are able to intimately connect with the audience. In short, Apollo 13 provides a true glimpse into the lives of those who defined history... <br /> <br />Tom Hanks plays the role of real life astronaut Jim Lovell, member of the three man crew of Apollo 13 - the 1970 lunar landing mission. Accompanied by fellow crewmates Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), Lovell rockets into space in pursuit of his dream of walking on the moon. Unable to make the flight, fellow astronaut Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) reluctantly remains on the ground. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Americans show little interest in this latest lunar mission despite the fact that barely a year has passed since Neil Armstrong's famous words. Apollo 13 is perceived as \\"routine\\" and the flight gets little press coverage until Lovell utters some famous words of his own, \\"Houston, we have a problem\\"... <br /> <br />When things go horribly wrong on Apollo 13, the mission changes from one of moon landing to astronaut survival. Lovell, Haise, and Swigert feverishly work to uncover the problem. Meanwhile, in Houston, flight director Gene Kranz (Ed Harris), bumped crew member Ken Mattingly, and the legions of NASA ground control work around the clock to maintain contact and bring the astronauts home safely. As the minutes pass, the entire world holds its breath in anticipation of the outcome... <br /> <br />Following on the coattails of Tom Hanks back-to-back Academy Awards for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump - Apollo 13 hit the movie theaters with widespread anticipation. The monumental expectations of movie goers were not without merit as the film's multiple Academy Award nominations will attest. But what makes Apollo 13 such a strong and emotion-driven epic is its connection with the historical record. The events that unfold happened for real, and at the time, no one knew the final outcome. Unlike today, traveling to space was not routine (or at least not as overlooked as it is now). The men who flew the Apollo 13 mission were true heroes in every sense of the word. <br /> <br />And although they failed to reach the moon, the astronauts of Apollo 13 are immortalized in history in ways they never would have been had their flight gone off without a hitch. Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and their colleagues do justice to this classic story of man's triumph over adversity. Compelling, suspenseful, and filled with drama, Apollo 13 is an unforgettable film - and a definite must-see movie... <br /> <br />The DVD Report

B0000A02TZ|5.0|Arriving on the scene in 1978, Animal House is the blockbuster frat house comedy that rewrote all the rules and created a generation of filmmakers hoping to replicate its comic genius. Original Saturday Night Live cast member John Belushi turned in a breakout film performance that made him a comedy rock star, propelling him to further fame with the release of Blues Brothers (1980). Tim Matheson also has his breakout role in the cult classic which features appearances by actors Mark Metcalf (\\"the Maestro\\" from Seinfeld), Donald Sutherland, and Kevin Bacon. <br /> <br />The film is set at fictional Faber College in the 1960s. Two incoming freshmen roommates, Larry Kroger (Tom Hulce) and Kent Dorfman (Stephen Furst), visit the various fraternities on campus in an effort to find a good group with which to socialize. But the two get more than they bargain for when the meet the guys of Delta House - a ragtag bunch of beer-swilling, womanizing, party animals. The group is the complete opposite of another campus fraternity, Omega House, headed by the snide, condescending preppies Greg Marmalard (James Daughton), Doug Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalf), and Chip Diller (Kevin Bacon). Favorites of Dean Wormer, the Omega House continually taunts Delta House and conspires with Dean Wormer to have the members of Delta expelled and their fraternity banned. <br /> <br />Leading the charge for Delta House is John \\"Bluto\\" Blutarsky (John Belushi), ladies man Eric \\"Otter\\" Stratton (Tim Matheson), and Donald \\"Boon\\" Schoenstein (Peter Riegert). Pledging Delta House, Larry and Kent are given the nicknames, Pinto and Flounder. Brought into the fold, they witness the true diversity of characters they are now brothers with. Otter seduces Dean Wormer's wife, and Bluto spits egg on Greg Marmalard while Boon and his girlfriend work through their problems.  <br /> <br />Things go well for the men of Delta House until Dean Wormer calls them into his office and places them on \\"Double Secret Probation\\".With Omega and Wormer aligned against them, Delta House is kicked off campus and its members expelled. But the great men of Delta refuse to go down without a fight. With the Homecoming parade set to begin, they unleash a fury of revenge on Wormer and company... <br /> <br />At the conclusion of the film, we learn of the whereabouts of all the various characters. The timeless humor of this film makes it no wonder that it has ascended to cult classic status. An original and witty comedy wielding a trailblazing influence on teen/college comedies, Animal House has earned its place in the hallowed halls of American cinematic classics... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
0975991477|5.0|Well it's about time!  For those of you who have been plagued by the dogma of DNA (genetic determinism or fatalism) will find this book beyond inspiring!  We have been told by western biology that the DNA is the at the heart of who we are, with the DNA in the cell nucleus being the brain of what activates and makes the cell function and control the rest of the body's activities.  From this model (actual called the 'DOGMA OF DNA' in Biology teachings) ALL life is DNA in motion and we are genetic beings with all our diseases and traits  (physical &amp; mnetal) pre-determined.  This model/paradigm has become a key part of the very structured and defined mechanistic biological pharmaceutical medicine we see domniating the West today (sigh).<br /> BUT in this book Lipton has flipped this notion upside with the profound discovery that the DNA in the nucleus is in fact is NOT the brain or determining factor of the body.  Lipton deconstructs the dogma by showing the mem-BRANE of the cell is the brain that is driving and determining the cells activities which equal the rest of the body and its functions.  The key here is the signals that are recieved by the cells mem-BRANE.  These signals consist of input from the environment but mainly the thoguhts of the individual.  He shows that when we become response-able and can pro-actively use our thoughts to cohere with the cells activities we have profound influence over their behavior.  THOUGHTS INFLUENCE BIOLOGY, now who chooses your thoughts??  When one controls the signals they control the cells and this changes everything we thought we knew about cell, the human body and ultimately dis-ease. <br />I found this book to be an important piece of the 'beyond the BLEEP' new science information that truly shows how 'our thoughts control our reality'.  The BLEEP opens up the dialogue but with not much advice on how to now engage this perspective.  Lipton's book is a beacon for it truly shows how this revision of perspective can radically empower YOU to know how and why you are able to change your life.  Unlock the power of your mind as it is a key piece of opening up to higher levels of operation inetranlly and exteranlly.  <br />The Biology of Belief is almost beyond belief as it is apart of the next phase of the new sciences that are dogma shattering.  This book is a leap forward :  <BR>knowledge is power - <BR>self-knowledge is self-empowerment - <BR>all you have to do is believe it!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Nominated for eight Academy Awards, and winner of four Oscars including Best Picture, A Beautiful Mind is one of the premier dramas of the decade. The brainchild of popular director Ron Howard (Opie from The Andy Griffith Show), A Beautiful Mind debuted to widespread critical acclaim due to the depth of its screenplay, the brilliant performances of Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, and the in-depth portrayal of a victim of mental illness. Based on the true story of John Nash, a schizophrenic mathematical genius who overcame his illness and went on to win the prestigious Nobel Prize for his \\"Game Theory,\\" A Beautiful Mind is one of the best films of the decade... <br /> <br />A young mathematical genius, John Nash (Russell Crowe) enjoys the early success of a budding career in academia. Able to complete mathematical formulas that baffle many of the greatest minds of his time, a young Nash stands on the brink of profound discovery with a limitless future and seemingly inevitable fame at his doorstep. Meeting a beautiful girl at an evening party, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) would later become Nash's wife. The two seem destined for a life of bliss. But Nash's problems were not confined to the mathematical arena... <br /> <br />Suffering from schizophrenia, Nash develops an acute sense of paranoia, decoding encrypted non-existent Soviet spy messages from comic books and newspaper advertisements. The reality in which he lives does not exist, and it threatens to tear apart his marriage, his career, and the very life which he holds dear... Can Nash overcome his debilitating disease and pursue the course of excellence to which he once seemed destined? The cast and crew of A Beautiful Mind allow us to see a whole new world through the eyes of suffering genius... <br /> <br />Russell Crowe's follow up performance to smash hits LA Confidential and Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind is an unbelievable journey into one man's reality. Russell Crowe's brilliant portrayal of the schizophrenic Nash and Jennifer Connelly's standout performance as the woman who loved him form an onscreen synergy that continually drives the screenplay of A Beautiful Mind. Exhibiting quality direction from Ron Howard, the film stands as an eternal testament to the beauty of the human mind and the durability of the human spirit to overcome obstacles and shine at its brightest.  <br /> <br />A fascinating film which successfully blurs the lines between John Nash's imagination and the world of reality, A Beautiful Mind vividly illustrates one man's struggle against great odds. As Nash's paranoia and hallucinations collude to blot out the genius of a beautiful mind, the power of the human spirit rallies to great heights - achieving a Nobel Prize and even the immortalization of one's own life in film! Nash should be lauded for his triumph against a paralyzing disease, and Ron Howard should be praised for delivering a cinematic masterpiece that shows us the true beauty of one man's plight. For these reasons and more, A Beautiful Mind is definite must-see film - perhaps one of the fifty best films of all time... <br /> <br />The DVD Report

B00003CX8Y|5.0|Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Beauty And The Beast is one of Disney's greatest animated achievements. Its massive success reinvigorated the Disney animation juggernaut which had lay dormant for decades, launching the release of smashing blockbusters such as Aladdin, The Lion King, and Finding Nemo. Taking home two Oscars for Best Music (Original Score and Original Song), the film launched a trend in Disney animation by blending musical numbers (with cartoon choreography), an aspect that would become a staple of film after film for the remainder of the decade. In short, Beauty And The Beast is a landmark production just as remarkable today as when it was first released... <br /> <br />Following the Disney tradition of transposing well-known fairy tales from the pages of a book to the sparkle of the big screen, Beauty And The Beast follows the life of Belle (Paige O'Hara), a beautiful bookworm maiden who captivates her town's most eligible bachelor, Gaston (Richard White). Dissatisfied with life in her small French villa, Belle grows especially tired of the conceited and self-absorbed Gaston (who is unable to fathom the idea that Belle does not welcome his affections).  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, The Beast lives in solitude in a long-ago abandoned castle, having had a spell cast upon him because of his inability to love. The spell turned the handsome prince into an ugly beast, and it turned all of his servants into dinnerware, candlesticks, and other inanimate objects. When Belle's father, Maurice (Rex Everhart) makes a wrong turn, he inadvertently unites the lives of Belle and The Beast. After spending much time with Belle, the bitter and hardened Beast begins to soften. He and Belle fall in love, but Gaston and his fellow village marauders arrive at the castle walls and demand the return of Belle, threatening to kill The Beast... <br /> <br />The highlight of Beauty And The Beast is the musical number \\"Be Our Guest,\\" which featured an entiredining hall filled with dancing teacups, plates, and eating utensils. The sequence forged the way for similar scenes in Aladdin (with \\"A Whole New World\\") and The Lion King (with \\"Hakuna Matata\\"). Directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise not only create a perfect transition from song to story, but they also manage to introduce innumerable humorous lines into musical sequences, especially with the early song bandied about by the rival for Belle's hand, Gaston. <br /> <br />One of the top films of all-time (from any genre, not just animation), Beauty And The Beast remains one of Disney's most heralded creations. It tells the classic love story of the beast with a good heart and does so with vivid characters, a world-class musical score, and animated visual images that would make Walt proud. Critically acclaimed and extremely successful at the box office, Beauty And The Beast is a true blockbuster in the traditional sense of the word. An awe-inspiring film that launched a new generation of animated Disney masterpieces, Beauty And The Beast is the quintessential must-see film...  <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0000CDL93|2.0|When this movie came out everyone was talking about it.  It was up for Best Picture against Silence of The Lambs, Bugsy, and Beauty And The Beast.  Looking back at 1992's Oscars, JFK should never been in there.   <br />  The Acting, from great actors, is over the top like in so many of Stone's films.  Not everything is supposed to be like a Greek tragedy!  Too many cutaways, and too many half assed historical \\"facts\\".   <br />  Stone's best work will always be Platoon.  That movie had it's over done scenes, but, it never went overboard like JFK, Nixon, Any Given Sunday . . . well, all his flicks since 1987's Wall Street. <br />  For anyone foolish enough to still retain affects from the conspiracy talk . . . it's  just a movie from a bad director.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Nominated for eight Academy Awards, and winner of five including Best Picture, American Beauty is one of the best films of all time. Exploring the depths of the American Dream - a good job, a nice house, the perfect marriage, etc. - the film is dripping with symbolism and satire. A cinematic study of societal dysfunction, American Beauty will affect a broad range of emotions within its viewing audience, and it'll make you laugh as well. This is a great movie, and although some people will shy away from it, everyone should see American Beauty at least once so they can form their own opinion... <br /> <br />Kevin Spacey plays the role of Lester Burnham, a middle-aged suburban resident who seemingly lives the American Dream. He and his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) have a nice house, a beautiful daughter Jane (Thora Birch), and successful careers. But things aren't always as they seem. In reality, the Burnham's are the definition of dysfunctional. They fight over everything, screaming at the dinner table about ridiculous things such as vegetables. Carolyn is engaged in an affair with rival real estate broker Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), and Lester is suffering from a creeping depression/mid-life crisis.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Jane is developing an infatuation with the strange boy who recently moved in next door, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) - a drug dealer/homespun director with a homophobic Marine Corps father, Frank. When the source of Frank's homophobia bubbles to the surface, we learn that - just like the Burnham's - most of the neighborhood is living a different life from that which shows on the outside... <br /> <br />Kevin Spacey follows up his amazing performances in The Usual Suspects and L.A. Confidential with his Academy Award for Best Actor in this film. Some of the funniest scenes in American Beauty involve the depressed Lester Burnham and his mid-life crisis meltdown. The way in which Spacey walks out of his job is utterly hilarious, and his weed-smoking,weight-lifting regimen in an effort to get pumped up and impress his daughter's friend is classic. But Spacey's performance is not alone. His brilliant role is complimented by Annette Bening's Oscar-caliber transformation into Lester's bitchy, cut-throat real-estate broker wife, Carolyn Burnham. Together, the two can stage an onscreen fight like no other fake married couple in cinema history, and it's a true pleasure to watch. <br /> <br />American Beauty is further strengthened by Chris Cooper's role as the Burnham's homophobic neighbor (October Sky, The Patriot, Seabiscuit) and Mena Suvari's role as the big-talking school girl Angela Hayes, object of Lester's desires (Kiss The Girls, American Pie). American Beauty is a film bursting with stage talent, one that benefits from solid direction, a well-designed screenplay, and superb dialogue. Odds are, you'll either love it or hate it. But irrespective of your final take, American Beauty will invoke passion one way or the other. That's why this film ranks as a definite must-see... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is by far Mariah's best album next to her debut. For me, it's about a tie. I would actually give \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" higher marks because I think putting out this album was a little more challenging. It's different when you debut for the first time because no one knows who you are and there aren't as many expectations. Mariah really has a lot riding on this record and she doesn't disappoint. It's difficult after having a phenomenal 15-year career to comeback with something equally as compelling and masterful as your debut which even Mariah herself will be measured against. Just when I thought nothing would ever top \\"Vision of Love,\\" \\"We Belong Together\\" is an easy first-place contender. I didn't even think Mariah could become better, but she found a way to improve in all aspects. Nothing is holding her back this time. I feel sorry for the people still spamming with 1 star because this album WILL debut at #1 on the Billboard 200 this week. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" deserves Album of the Year consideration. This is one Mariah album that you don't want to miss. Her voice has the power and presence that so many others lack. Only Mariah could make a comeback with such poise and distinction. The verdict is in: Mariah's back!!!
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Hands down, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is the best Christmas comedy ever filmed. I make it habit to watch this movie about ten million times between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. Even after seeing the film so many times that I can recite it word-for-word, Christmas Vacation remains as hilarious and entertaining as the previous holiday season. More than just a seasonal film, it's one of those rare comedies that it near perfect from beginning to end.  <br /> <br />Following the ongoing exploits of Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) and the Griswold family, this particular rendition of the classic Vacation movies is arguably the best. As in the previous films, Clark's goal is to create the perfect vacation for his family. Only this time, instead of hitting the road for Wally World, the Griswolds stay at home in suburban Chicago. <br /> <br />Julia Louis-Dreyfus (mere months away from signing on to play Elaine on Seinfeld) makes several appearances as Clark's annoying, yuppie neighbor Margot - a character accompanied by her equally yuppie partner, Todd (Nicholas Guest). Randy Quaid makes a return appearance as Cousin Eddie (playing the same role from the original Vacation film). As Clark's less-cultured relative, Eddie is a man whose \\"heart is bigger than his brain\\". Beverly D'Angelo also returns in her previous role as Clark's wife, Ellen. <br /> <br />When Clark vows to create \\"the most fun-filled old-fashioned family Christmas ever,\\" things naturally go awry. With the Griswold family and their in-laws living under one roof, the relatives constantly get on each other's nerves. Clark sets out to decorate the house for Christmas, and his quest culminates in a 25,000 light extravaganza that cover every square inch of the house. In the process, he nearly breaks his neck several times and knocks out Todd and Margot's window with a flying lance of roof gutter ice. <br /> <br />The laughs multiply several times over when Cousin Eddie arrives uninvited and parks the family RV in the Griswold driveway. He brings his wife Catherine, their two kids Ruby Sue and Rocky, and their lovely dog \\"Snots\\". The crescendo of disaster steadily increases as Christmas Day approaches with the agony compounded by Clark's failure to receive his annual Christmas bonus. Clark's big Christmas surprise for the family is that he's putting in a pool, but in order to start work as soon as the ground thawed out, he had to put down a hefty deposit which his check won't cover without the Christmas bonus. <br /> <br />After a Christmas Eve in which the turkey explodes, Aunt Bethany's cat electrocutes itself, Uncle Lewis burns down the tree, and a squirrel gets loose in the house, a late night knock on the door gives Clark hope. A deliveryman hands him an envelope which fell between the seats - the fabled Christmas bonus.  <br /> <br />But when the bonus turns out to be a membership in the Jelly-Of-The-Month Club instead of the cash he expected, Clark goes nuts. He extensively curses his boss, Frank Shirley, and tells the family that a nice Christmas gift would be Shirley wrapped in big red bow. Wanting to do something nice for Clark, Cousin Eddie takes the request literally. He kidnaps Mr. Shirley and delivers him to the Griswold house where Mr. Shirley reveals he cut out Christmas bonuses this year. Clark confronts him, and Mr. Shirley agrees that it was the wrong thing to do. He reinstates the bonuses, and tells Clark to add twenty percent. The whole family erupts in celebration, but their Christmas party is soon crashed by a SWAT team which takes the house by siege. <br /> <br />Originally released in 1989, Christmas Vacation has surprisingly little content that makes it look \\"dated\\". As such, it's certain to be a holiday viewing tradition for generations to come... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am not a big sci-fi or western fan and this show has both genres. Nevertheless, I love this show. It has something for everyone who likes good character development and a fast paced plot. My husband and I have only one more episode to watch and then we will have seen the whole series. We are already feeling a loss over that (only 1 more). Great show that you will love. It seems that all the good stuff gets cancelled and the total junk stays on forever.
B000055Y0X|5.0|One of the most interesting films of all time, Dr Strangelove is a farcical look at the insane underpinnings of some of the Cold War theories regarding Mutual Assured Destruction. With the Soviet Union and the United States threatening to utilize the tools of nuclear war (sanity began to sink in following the Cuban Missile Crisis) - each to prevent the other from dominating his realm - a brilliant satire on the situation was inevitable. Highly regarded director Stanley Kubrick (of A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey) rose to the challenge. Despite the four decades which have passed since the release of Dr Strangelove, the film retains its place as a masterpiece of social commentary. And regardless of one's political ideology, Dr Strangelove is outrageously funny... <br /> <br />Gathering a collection of oddball kooks, paranoid wackos, and outright insane individuals, the characters in Dr Strangelove bring the world to the very edge of destruction - without batting an eye, and all the while inexplicably protecting their petty fiefdoms from the greedy hands of their perceived enemies. After all, what if some bombs are left over after the nuclear war and the other side uses them to strike at our cave dwellings - to seize our caves!!!! In short, Dr Strangelove is a film beyond description. One just has to see it for himself... <br /> <br />When U.S. Air Force Colonel Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) goes completely insane, believing the communists are conspiring to poison the 'bodily fluids' of the American populace, he orders his squadrons to attack the U.S.S.R. and drop a payload of nuclear bombs. The lone renegade sparks U.S. military action against his stronghold and a top level meeting between US President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) and his top advisors. Conversing with Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky (Peter Bull), the president tries to put an end to the crisis and avert nuclear war. But he learns instead that a nuclear strike by the US would automatically trigger a Soviet 'Doomsday' machine which will destroy all known life on Earth. <br /> <br />Desperate to save the world, the president must deal with a drunken Soviet Premier, the warmonger General 'Buck' Turgidson (George C. Scott), and listen to the droning monologues of former Nazi-scientist, turned genius advisor, Dr. Strangelove (Sellers). Sellers is hilarious in this role as well as his others. Overall, this movie is a hilarious series of laughs with an endless number of one-liners such as \\"Gentleman, you can't fight in here! This is the war room!\\" <br /> <br />Hilarious to the end, Dr Strangelove is a modern satire that would make Jonathan Swift proud. Nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Picture, Dr Strangelove nevertheless went home from the Oscars empty handed. But the picture's legacy only seems to grow with the passing of time. Standout, Oscar-worthy performances by Peter Sellers and George C. Scott strengthen every aspect of the film, and the end of the Cold War only witnessed the rise of a new war against Islamic terrorism - with some similarly ridiculous ideas emanating from Washington's power brokers... Overall, this is a funny movie that puts the world political stage back in perspective. Its enduring success makes Dr. Strangelove a definite must-see film... <br /> <br />The DVD Report

B00005JM02|5.0|Winner of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, Finding Nemo continues the Disney tradition of producing high-quality, blockbuster films that entertain audiences of all ages. Featuring the wonders of the Pixar animation technology, the film is a breathtaking window into the future of animated pictures, with borderline 3-D visual effects and the introduction of original animated film techniques certain to influence future masterpieces. Boasting a slew of talented voiceovers such as Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould, Willem Dafoe, and John Ratzenberger, Finding Nemo is certain to maintain a place in the hearts of children of all ages for generations to come... <br /> <br />The epic story begins somewhere in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Australia. A clown fish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) lives a wonderful life in a peaceful underwater colony of fish and other fascinating sea life with his wife. That serene setting is demolished, however, when a vicious predator attacks their home, killing his wife. Distraught, Marlin takes comfort in the egg left behind which forms into his son, Nemo (Alexander Gould).  <br /> <br />Because of his trauma, Marlin is extremely overprotective of Nemo. He follows a step behind him everywhere he goes, makes him stay in the house whenever possible, and remains quite apprehensive about his son going to school. Marlin's fears are realized when Nemo is captured on his first day of school and taken away to live in a dentist office fish tank. Intent on freeing his son, Marlin sets out on a bold and daring quest to retrace the path of the scuba diver's boat.  <br /> <br />Wandering through the ocean depths, he meets up with Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) - an absent-minded, yet friendly - fish who remains determined to help her new friend recover his lost son. Together, they encounter a pack of sharks with whom they eventually make friends as well as a countless array of diverse and fascinating underwater creatures. <br /> <br/>Meanwhile, Nemo is plunged into a dentist office fish tank overlooking Sidney Harbor where he meets a number of new and exciting friends. The other aquatic life, long confined to the tank themselves, initiate Nemo into their fraternity, revealing their numerous attempts to escape from the tank. Enlisting Nemo as their point man (or fish), they concoct a number of schemes such as clogging the tank's filter so they can make a break for it when the dentist takes them out to clean the tank. With the threat of the dentist presenting Nemo as a present to his nerdy niece, the stakes are raised for our young hero and time is of the essence. <br /> <br />While Nemo carries out his own plans of escape, Marlin continues his search. Along the way, he meets up with some surfer-dude sea turtles who aid in his trek. Discouraged at times, Marlin finds out that he's made of much more than he thought, and he and Dory find their way to Sidney where they encounter a newly liberated Nemo... <br /> <br />Sporting one of the best written animated screenplays of all time and an breathtaking original score by Thomas Newman, Finding Nemo is a pleasurable affair for both parents and children. The writers pull off an admirable job of combining adult and kid humor throughout the script in such a way that it doesn't detract from the experience for either age group. With a number of likeable characters, the audience will find itself rooting for Marlin, Nemo, and all their friends to accomplish the task before them. Overall, this is a must-see film for all age groups, not only because of the great story and artful performances, but if anything, simply because the animation is a wonder in and of itself... <br /> <br />The DVD Report

0783231202|4.0|Another Steven Spielberg cinematic triumph, Amistad garnered four Academy Award nominations - among them, Best Music Original Dramatic Score (John Williams) and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Anthony Hopkins). Based on the true story of the 1839 slave revolt on the slave trade ship Amistad, the film provides a dramatic visual glimpse into the horrors of 19th Century slavery. Just as Spielberg's masterpiece Schindler's List created an onscreen record to account for the Nazi atrocities of the Holocaust, Amistad stands as a testament to the evils of the Atlantic slave trade with the United States of America. Be prepared to watch a film with graphic portrayals of human bondage and mistreatment... <br /> <br />When Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) is lured from the safety of his African village and trapped like a wild animal, slave traders place him in bondage and board him on a large ship set to sail for the Caribbean. Chained to the floor, side-by-side inside the hull of the galleon, hundreds and hundreds of kidnapped Africans are brutally packed together like sardines. They are rarely fed (and very little when food is given), and they must use the bathroom where they lie, be sick where they lie, and some even die while chained to the others. The conditions are a literal hell on earth. <br /> <br />These opening scenes, just like Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, are the most vivid and powerful - creating images that will stay with you forever. Chained together, one-after-another, the slaves are punished when one of them is thrown overboard, dragging the others to the bottom of the sea.  <br /> <br />However, one slave aboard Amistad decides to fight back. When the opportunity presents itself late one night, Cinque sparks a revolt against the slave traders. He and his fellow countrymen take the ship by force and kill their captors. Now free, the men attempt to set sail for their native land, but in the darkness of night, they end up sailing to America instead. <br /> <br />Thegrounded ship gains national political interest when the survivors of the Amistad are treated as slaves. Even President Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) takes an interest in the matter. When young and idealistic lawyer Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) and freedman Joadson (Morgan Freeman) take up the task of representing Cinque's interests in an American court, the case becomes larger than life. Cinque tells the tale of his capture, the island sorting facility for future American slaves, and the mistreatment of human beings in the pursuit of monetary profit. When the case goes before the Supreme Court, former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) enters the picture in an attempt to win a victory for freedom and individual rights... <br /> <br />One of the most dramatic and important films of the decade, Amistad will open your eyes to the mistakes of our past. It will make you angry at the past injustices of preceding generations. But more importantly, Amistad serves as a reminder to the current and to future generations that freedom is not to be taken for granted. It is the birthright of all men, and it is our obligation to fight for it whenever we can. This important message, and its historical lessons, make Amistad a definite must-see movie that no American can afford to miss... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0002OERI0|4.0|A welcome return for a great rock band sees Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool experiment a little by creating a rock opera. Before you instantly dismiss this as being a huge mistake, it actually works. Ok so the story is near enough impossible to follow but you get the feeling that Green Day are trying to tell a story with this album. Some of the songs also show Greendays hatred for a certain American President, not to name names. Here is a track by track analysis of the songs. <br /> <br />1:American Idiot <br />The first single that was released in the UK, and a fast upbeat dig at american culture. The lyrics ring out about a nation of fools led to believe things by the media. A good start to a good album. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />2:Jesus of Suburbia <br />The fact that this track runs for about 10 minutes doesnt stop the fact it is one of the finest tracks on the album. The five parts of the song could all be songs in themselves if they were added to. (especially City of the Dead) that chapter could be a song in its own right. Listen to this song all the way through and you wont be disappointed. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />3:Holiday <br />The second best song on the album, a fast upbeat piece of punk rock that has a riff that you will be humming for weeks to come. Ther clever lyrics also strike out at Mr president and his ways of ruling the world. This is a song to listen to at high volume at a party. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />4:Boulevard of Broken Dreams <br />Just clinches best song on the album. This song could easily be an Oasis number with its catchy verses and hooky chorus. Definetly a song to listen to at high volume while driving.  <br />10/10 <br /> <br />5.Are We The Waiting <br />A slow, short and sweet number, that perfectly suits Billie Joe's singing style. Slightly too short for my liking, also a bit depressing with no hooky guitar riffs. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />6.St Jimmy <br />This song suffers from its own speed, it tries to be a fast addictive rocky piece but ends up going too fast for people to sing along to, but on the whole it works well after two slow songs. Definetly a song to listen to when your angry. <br />5/10 <br /> <br />7.Give me Novacaine <br />Third best song on the album. Starts off slow and builds up to a great chorus. The music doesnt drown out the vocals and theres even a hint of nostalgia for me when i listen to this song, reminds me of being out on a friday, towards the end of the night when everyone is drunk and falling around in the bar. Youll know when you hear it. And even includes a mini guitar solo. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />8:Shes a Rebel <br />The most GreenDayish song on the album. And it works, catchy short sweet guitar riff. Mini guitar solo and repetitive lyrics. Greenday at their old school best. Its just there new stuff is better! <br />8/10 <br /> <br />9:Extraordinary Girl. <br />Again classic Greenday,  but nowhere near as good. starts off sounding like Indian tribal music, the chorus is good, but not much else is unfortunately, the unlucky winner of worst song on the album.  <br />5/10 <br /> <br />10:Letterbomb <br />Strange opening. good addictive lyrics that also have meaning. another song thats much better when played loud. A short sweet song that is the final heavyish song on the album. Not bad, but not the best <br />7/10 <br /> <br />11:Wake Me Up When September Ends <br />A tribute to September 11, tries to be Good Riddance(Time of your life). Fails. Enough said really. starts off well but bringing in heavy guitar was a mistake, once acoustic always acoustic. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />12:Homecoming <br />Another 10 minute belter of a song, unfortunately cant meet up to the standards set by Jesus of Suburbia but a good song never the less. Tre Cools little rock and roll bit is highly amusing but the song never really takes off <br />8/10 <br /> <br />13. Whatsername <br />A good end to a fantastic album. This song is perfect Greenday, sounds a bit like Brain Stew. A good closer but not good enough to be the worthy last track on the album. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />Overall <br />8/10 <br />The album starts off fantastically but slips at about track 6, it begins to look up again towards the end but it never really does go up as much as it should.  <br />A great comeback nevertheless. Good Job!
B0000A98ZP|5.0|One of the defining movies of the 80's decade, The Breakfast Club remains an entertaining film which evokes nostalgia among many viewers. Inevitably, any foray into the cinema blockbusters of the 1980s will evoke a number of titles, such as Back To The Future, Beverly Hills Cop, or The Goonies. The Breakfast Club is certainly one of those films, and it's almost universally cited as one of the preeminent films from the era. If you enjoy relationship films, it's easy to see why, because The Breakfast Club is a movie built solely on the strength of its characters and the conflict surrounding them... <br /> <br />Shermer High School principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) oversees the Saturday morning detention of five high school students from differing backgrounds. Confining them to the library, he fails to relate to them as individuals with a future or a purpose. Making up the cast of misfit characters are Andy Clark (Emilio Estevez), Brian Ralph Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), John Bender (Judd Nelson), Claire Standish (Molly Ringwold), and Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy). Forced to spend their Saturday together, the five students strike up a conversation (with the exception of the muted Allison). For the most part, their conversation consists of picking on each other and making jokes at each other's expense. <br /> <br />Continually butting heads with Principal Vernon, the teens help pass the time by uniting against Vernon and by engaging in conversation with the infinitely wise janitor, Carl (John Kapelos). Eventually, each student (including Allison, who eventually opens up) comes to understand the plight of the other. The pretty princess Claire doesn't have a perfect life. Neither does the popular wrestling champ Andy. Brian and Allison have their own problems just like anyone else, and John puts up a front to look tougher and more hardened than he really is. In the end, the five develop a lifelong bond - with Claire and John igniting a budding relationship... <br /> <br />Sporting a smash hit soundtrack headlined by Simple Minds' \\"Don't You (Forget About Me),\\" The Breakfast Club attained instant cult classic status. The 'brat pack' came to define a generation and made its mark in Hollywood. A light-hearted comedy, blended together with a series of relationships between different people, The Breakfast Club's true strength lies with the ability of its audience to relate to the issues at hand. The characters recount stories from their lives that in one way or another are easily relatable to most every American who attended high school. <br /> <br />It's this universal familiarity with the themes depicted by The Breakfast Club that make it a classic adored by millions. Despite the longings of teenagers throughout time to forge unique identities and set themselves aside as revolutionary, in the end, most high schools sport the same cast of characters, and those various roles have remained unchanged for most of the last several decades. As one of the most memorable films of the 80's decade, The Breakfast Club is a definite must-see movie... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00004RJ71|5.0|Blood In Blood Out is tied with Scarface and Do The Right Things as my all-time favorite movies. There is so many great qualities about Blood In Blood Out, I don't know where to begin. The cinematography is phenomenal, with outstanding use of Los Angeles locales. A good chunk of the movie was also filmed in San Quentin State Prison, and almost all of the men you see in the penitentiary are real-life inmates, giving this film a powerful sense of gritty realism.  <br /> <br />The plot follows the exploits of two half-brothers and their cousin, Miklo. Miklo is a mixed ethnic heritage. His mother is Chicano, while his father is white. Miklo is a true rubio (a fair-haired, blue-eyed person) who passionately embraces his Chicano roots, but finds that his Anglo features are a disadvantage in the Latino world he seeks to be a part of. I feel that this identity crisis and struggle is one of the stronger elements of the plot. Personally, I can relate to much of what Miklo is going through. <br /> <br />The major theme throughout this movie is the issue of identity. Miklo, Cruz, and Paco all face difficult trials and tribulations, which shape their lives and identities. Paco, fighting a horrific back injury and heroin addiction, finds his life calling through his creativity and art work which depicts Chicano life in the barrio. Paco's life takes a 180 and he dedicates his life to serving the Chicano community as a police detective. Miklo, on the other hand, finds his inner-strength as a member of La Onda, a Chicano prison gang. <br /> <br />If you love action flicks, this one's for you. There is non-stop action for the full three hours. However, the film is extremely violent so be forewarned.
B000068CNX|5.0|Along with Seinfeld and Frasier, Friends dominated the must-see TV of the 1990's. Winner of innumerable television awards, the show features the lives of six friends in their late-twenties/early-thirties living in New York City - Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry).

B00001OH7T|2.0|Lets get to the point here - I give this album two stars each for the two hits  (the title track and Fame). However both of these tunes sound out of place  when compared to the rest of the album that sounds like demo versions of songs not yet fully developed. While Bowie might have been fascinated with the R&B scene of America to the extent that he secured the services of a top flight backing band fluent in the genre (Alomar, Weeks, Newmark, Vandross), the full potential of this lineup didn't manifest except on the two hits leaving listeners to wonder what went wrong with the rest of the album. It certainly wasn't a question of talent of course. Also consider that Fame was cowritten with Alomar and Lennon though its the former's work with James Brown that enabled this song to take off as it did.  Given the authenticity of backing band its a mystery as to why the rest of the album sounds so thin in comparison. Since Bowie was at the helm then he'll have to bear responsibility for that. <br />
B0002F6BRE|4.0|This Christmas, discover your inner elf... At least, that's the tagline for Elf, one of the funniest films of 2003. Packed with a cast of Hollywood all-star talent, Elf is guaranteed to make you laugh. The touching story about an adopted elf who discovers he's really a boy is sort of a bizzaro-Pinocchio story that opened to such widespread critical acclaim that it unanimously swept zero Oscars at the 2004 Academy Awards ceremony! Nevertheless, Elf is worth the price of admission. Although Christmas Vacation still holds the title as the top Christmas comedy, Elf is still a great night's entertainment... <br /> <br />Buddy (Will Ferrell) is an oversized elf working away at the North Pole. Always wearing a smile, he dwarfs his comrades and never seems able to find his niche in the toy-making arena. Eventually, Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) is forced to reveal the truth to Buddy. He's actually a human. He's not really an elf at all. The elves love buddy just the same, but Buddy feels the need to strike out on his own and try to find himself - and maybe even his family too... <br /> <br />Scouring the streets of New York City, Buddy must learn the urban rules of life. In due time, he manages to track down his biological father, a successful publishing executive named Walter (James Caan). But despite the prodding of his wife Emily (Mary Steenburgen), Walter is reluctant to start a relationship with the over-eager grown-up child... <br /> <br />In the meantime, Buddy spends his days working at Gimbel's department store where he stars as a department store Santa's elf and a Christmas season decorator, creating a magical wonderland that thrills customers and employees alike. Striking up a relationship with fellow employee Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), Buddy's life is slowly transitioning from elf to human... But will he be able to survive in the big city? Will he be able to rekindle a relationship with his father? Elf thoroughly entertains us while we find out... <br /> <br />With a great cast of writers, Elf manages to keep the laughs rolling throughout the entirety of the film. Although lacking in some areas (it's not one of the greatest comedies of all-time), Elf is a hilarious movie in its own right. Will Ferrell turns in an amazing performance as Buddy. Like Tom Hanks in Big, he's actually believable as the innocent man-child roaming the streets of New York City. It's this farcical innocence that provides Elf with the charm necessary to keep the audience involved in the story beginning to end. Because of its laugh factor, and the surprisingly small number of decent Christmas-themed movies, Elf is a definite must-see film... Check it out this Christmas! <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B000005Z0G|4.0|2Pac 2nd album has every 2pac cd has great lyrics but suffers bad outdated production, but hey 93 pac is better than anything today on the radio so it is still enjoyable with great cuts, some of my favs include Holler If Ya' Hear Me (my favourite 2pac song ever because of the lyrics, hook and banging beat), Point the Finga is another great song, i like the beat on this one, Last Wordz consists of Pac,Ice T and Ice Cube, deadly alliance right there, great song. Souljah's Revenge,Representin' 93, Keep Ya Head Up, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z, I Get Around and Papa'z Song are all great songs, Keep Ya Head Up,I Get Around and Papa'z Song are most likely considered to be the classics from this album. Good album by Pac but would get a whole better on his next album.
B00000K3CR|5.0|The film that propelled Tom Hanks to superstar status, Big is one of the funniest and most friendly films to ever hit the big screen. Harboring its own unique charm, the movie wraps a unique and compelling storyline around a cast of likeable characters to create a film audiences will never forget. Director Penny Marshall became the first woman to direct a film grossing over one-hundred million dollars when Big was first released in 1988 (that's an actual Trivial Pursuit question I ran across that might come in handy someday)...<br /><br />When a young suburban boy named Josh (David Moscow) attends a local carnival with his family, his young life is turned upside down when the girl he has a crush on is allowed on a rollercoaster while he learns that he is still too young. Distraught, the boy makes a wish on an antique magic wish arcade machine. He wishes he was big, and the machine spits out its answer on a small piece of cardboard, \\"Wish granted.\\" Josh thinks nothing of the reply until he wakes up the next morning as an adult version of himself (Tom Hanks).<br /><br />Run out of the house by his own mother, Josh turns to his best friend Billy (Jared Rushton) for help. But after convincing his friend, who's only ten-years-old himself, Billy can't provide much help except a small bit of cash and advice on getting a job. When Josh rents an apartment in New York City, Billy comes to visit him periodically. Playing guns in the toy store FAO Schwartz, the two run into MacMillan (Robert Loggia) founder of a toy manufacturer. MacMillan hits it off with Josh (the two men step dance a Chopin tune on a giant foot-operated piano in an extremely memorable and famous scene), and the toy titan immediately hires Josh to work for his company in the area of toy-related research.<br /><br />Climbing the corporate totem pole at MacMillan because of his vast insight into the toy preferences of kids, Josh befriends Susan (Elizabeth Perkins), a top-level executive hoping to learn what makes Josh such a master of the boardroom. But Susan's pursuit of Josh is not looked upon favorably by her colleague Paul (John Heard) who's spent his entire career kissing up to MacMillan only to have the inexperienced Josh appear out of nowhere and become the boss's favorite. This conflict, coupled with the breakdown of Josh and Billy's relationship, causes the adult kid to wish he could be his young self once again...<br /><br />One of the best scenes in the film is when Susan reveals to Josh that she can't believe she's considering sleeping over at his home. Josh replies by saying he does it all the time and gives her the option of the top or the bottom bunk! Hanks really comes off as a kid trapped in an adult's body, and that's why Big works so well. So well, in fact, that it became an instant comedy classic...<br /><br />Prior to Sleepless In Seattle, Forrest Gump, and Saving Private Ryan, Tom Hanks took Hollywood by storm with his charming performance in this larger than life movie. Big is a feel-good comedy without any foul language, gratuitous violence, or endless explosions. It simply retells the timeless tale of a young boy who wishes he were grown and doing grown up things - only in this instance, the kid gets his wish. As one of the biggest blockbusters of the 1980s, Big is a definite must-see film. Don't hesitate to see it...<br /><br />The DVD Report
B00009V8Z9|4.0|I had really enjoyed the single \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" and it prompted me to go out and get the album.  Boy was I shocked, it might be the second best album I've heard from this year.  I can't stop listening to it, very loving and emotional.  With hints of rock, pop, R&B, it just pulls at your heart with the melodies.  The lyrics in fact don't stand out, rather become easily blended within the piano playing and rest of the music, making each rising chorus all the more powerful. <br />Personally I enjoyed \\"Follow Through\\"'s playfulness, \\"Chariot\\"'s uplifting ability, \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\"'s defiance and \\"More Than Anyone\\" the most with its emotional cries.  You'll definitely want to pick it up, as it is instantly addicting and something that will keep popping up to the top of your collection.
6305609705|5.0|Nominated for eight Academy Awards, Apocalypse Now is one of the more controversial films of its time. Based on Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, the film illustrates the worst of human nature and catalogues the horrors of the Vietnam War. Hollywood legend Francis Ford Coppola is the brains behind this portrayal of one man's descent into the depths of hell and his confrontation with the demons around him and within himself. Sporting a Lord Of The Flies theme, Apocalypse Now is an unforgettable film every movie buff should see at least once... <br /> <br />Martin Sheen plays the role of Captain Benjamin L. Willard, a top-tier Vietnam soldier tasked with a mission of entering Cambodia in search of a renegade Green Beret, Lt. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando). With orders to \\"terminate with extreme prejudice,\\" Willard enters depths of the sweltering jungle where he and his crew become captive to the wild and untamed jungle, seduced by the allure of drugs - fascinated with the Darwinian nature of the world around them. One-by-one, Willard's men are picked off until he alone is left to face down the infamous Lt. Kurtz. <br /> <br />Having formed his own army from U.S. military deserters, Kurtz lives among a local tribe where he has set himself up to be God incarnate. Willard must learn to walk into the devil's lair and defeat his opponent without becoming subject to the same laws and temptations which drove Kurtz mad in the first place. Will Willard successfully carry out his mission, or will Kurtz have the last say? Apocalypse Now leaves its audience in the grips of smothering suspense in anticipation of the final outcome... <br /> <br />Marlon Brando makes one of his more memorable cinematic appearances as the rogue Green Beret who is the focal point of the seek-and-destroy mission. His reputation as a master of the big screen is solidified following a career which boasted of such masterful films as The Godfather (also a Francis Ford Coppola production). In addition, Brando's performance is complimented by a younger Martin Sheen who does well with an extremely complicated role. And notable brief appearances by Harrison Ford (Colonel Lucas) and Dennis Hopper (a photojournalist) help to make Apocalypse Now a cult classic among those who study the careers of Hollywood stars. <br /> <br />With the passing of time, Apocalypse Now only seems to grow in stature among the ranks of the film elite. Many reputable critics rank the film in their top 100 of all-time, and the film is certain to provoke emotions in one direction or another. With a first-class director, great writing, and an all-star cast, Apocalypse Now is a film that lives up to its hype. The synergy of its parts makes the film greater as a whole, and that's why Apocalypse Now is a definite must-see film... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0007OCG4W|2.0|Like a plot...Like some believable characters...Like an ending. <br />This wasn't really a movie as much as a bunch of clips strung together without any real, clear meaning.  I could say it was foolish, sophomoric, vapid, and devoid of meaning, and all that would be true.  But to be truly accurate about it, I guess I would have to ask Mike Nichols why he thought enough of this to direct it.   <br /> <br />Some of the scenery was striking and with what they gave him to work with, Clive Owen was very good, hence the two stars.  If you don't see this you won't have missed a thing.
0767836286|3.0|Winner of the Nicholl Fellowship Screenwriting competition sponsored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Arlington Road is only the sixth winner of the award to actually make it onto the big screen. Sporting a star-studded cast, the film creates an aura of tension and suspense that keeps the audience glued to the screen. With a thought-twisting and surprising plotline, Arlington Road reinforces the post-September 11th (even though it's a 1999 movie) mentality that terrorists lurk around every corner. Tim Robbins puts in his best performance since appearing in the critically acclaimed Shawshank Redemption, and Jeff Bridges turns in a memorable performance himself. Both are fitting, since Arlington Road is a memorable movie... <br /> <br />Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a college professor who specializes in studying homegrown terrorists in the United States. A resident of Northern Virginia, his FBI agent wife died in the midst of a botched Ruby Ridge-style government raid. With a ten-year-old son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark), to raise, Michael becomes an expert on the mindset and methods of terrorists such as Timothy McVeigh. Studying the terrorist threat becomes the central focus of his life, and its domination of his thoughts causes Michael to develop an acute form of paranoia. <br /> <br />But when the Arlington Road (the street where Michael lives) house next door is purchased by Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack), Michael's life begins to change for the better. The friendliness of his new neighbors creates new inroads in Michael's ability to coup with the loss of his wife, and Grant becomes best friends with the Langs' son Brady (Mason Gamble). Things are going smoothly between the Faradays and the Langs until Michael catches Oliver in a petty lie. Immediately, his paranoia kicks in, and as the Langs continue their strange behavior (such as hiding a set of blueprints from him), Michael's fears get the best of him. <br /> <br />Investigating the background of the Langs, Michael finds out that they are not who they claim to be. In fact, Oliver is actually known as William Fenimore. Convinced that the Langs are planning an attack on the FBI headquarters (one on par with the Oklahoma City bombing), Michael attempts to convince his son, his colleagues, and anyone who will listen. But no one seems to understand. Will Michael convince the FBI before it's too late? Or is he only a delusional madman living out his paranoid fantasies in the aftermath of his wife's death? <br /> <br />Wrought with suspense and peppered with hair-raising moments, Arlington Road is a unique and compelling film. The premise is befitting of a post-September 11th terrorist film, and I wouldn't be surprised if Hollywood remakes the film using Islamic terrorists instead of the homegrown brand from this movie. With a surprise ending which will keep you guessing until the end (and probably afterward since the whole thing tends to stretch the limits of reality), Arlington Road is a fun and interesting film. Possessing a well-maintained level of suspense and an interesting set of characters, Arlington Road is a definite must-see film... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
6304493681|5.0|I have seen this movie both on TV and on DVD, and it's still one of my favorite anime films ever. People keep conparing it to the Matrix series, but it's NOTHING like the Matrix. It's a sci-fi/mystery story instead of a crazy sci-fi saving man-kind form the obvious forces of \\"evil\\". Instead it deals with human psychology and with mystery. It follows the two main characters(the Major and Batu)as they try to hunt down a new hacker calling himself \\"The puppet master\\" who has been cyber-brain hacking cyborgs all over the place. The story is really good, and the art is incredible. Ghost in the Shell is one of those anime cult classics(much like Akira or Macross) that leaves you breathless everytime you see it.  <br /> <br />The action scenes are very well done, and very smooth. The scenes where characters are talking(and let me tell ya, they talk a good amount of time) are informative to the plot and the background of the world these people live in. If you want jsut wild shoot 'em up action, then I would suggest something more like Akira. This film has a good amount of talking, and a good amount of action. <br /> <br />All in all, this is still one of the best films ever made(I like anime and live action films) that i've seen. On a scale of 1-10 it gets a 9.5(only because it was a little too short).  <br /> <br />If you enjoy this movie, i'd check out Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. It's a good series that follows the exploits of the Major, Batu and everyone else at Public Securtiy Section 9. Great show, great movie.....great series in general. Check it out.
078322611X|5.0|Receiving a 1990 Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, Field of Dreams is as close to perfect as a movie can be (character \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson's right-handed batting stance is about the only flaw that can be found). Director Phil Alden Robinson turns in a Frank Capra-esque performance with his brilliant adaptation of W.P. Kinsella's book Shoeless Joe. A rare, family-friendly movie that will captivate and inspire adults both young and old, Field of Dreams is a must-see film for any lover of life. <br /> <br />The story begins with a narration by Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) of his life up this point - his father's love of baseball (especially \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson), his estrangement from his father at a young age, the upheaval of the 1960s, and finally, Ray's love affair with his wife Annie (Amy Madigan). In their mid-thirties, the couple takes a bold step when they purchase an Iowa farm and settle down with their daughter Karin. <br /> <br />In the opening scene, one of the most famous movie lines in history is hoist upon the audience. While Ray tends to his cornfield, he hears a mysterious voice whisper, \\"If you build it, he will come...\\" Realizing that he is the only one who hears the voice, Ray struggles with the idea that he is going crazy. That is, until one night when he looks out his bedroom window and envisions a baseball field in his backyard. Believing that if he builds the baseball field, \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) will come to play upon its surface, Ray acquires the blessing of his wife and sets out to make his dream a reality. <br /> <br />Plowing up his cornfield and building a full-size baseball diamond, the whole town thinks Ray has gone nuts. After an uneventful year passes by, Ray begins to believe them. He and Annie are struggling to keep themselves together financially when Karin points out that a man is standing on her daddy's baseball field. Ray turns on the lights and goes outside to greet him. The man he meets is \\"Shoeless\\"Joe. Immediately, Annie and Ray agree that they will keep the field at all costs. \\"Shoeless\\" Joe brings other ex-ballplayers out of the mysterious corn to practice and throw the ball around, when Ray hears the voice yet again... \\"Go the distance,\\" it says. <br /> <br />Pondering the intent of this latest voice, Ray determines that he must go to Boston to meet with Terence Mann (James Earl Jones), an influent 1960's writer whose books are being considered for a ban by the local school board. Winning over the reclusive writer, Ray and Terence travel to Minnesota to find Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham (Burt Lancaster) whose name they saw emblazoned in the scoreboard lights at Fenway. When a young Archie appears by the roadside to join them on their return trip to the corn-carved ball field, truly magical things begin to take place. <br /> <br />Karin's life is saved by a ghost thankful for his chance to live out his long lost dream, and the farm is saved from foreclosure when Ray's brother-in-law Mark finally realizes the true value of the baseball field and thousands of visitors are drawn to its magic from parts unknown. With an emotional surprise ending sure to touch most audience members, Field of Dreams is a film for the ages... <br /> <br />The DVD Report

B00005JN2Z|4.0|Nominated for two Academy Awards, Collateral is an electrifying, high-energy drama about a paid assassin who kidnaps a cab driver in order to carry out his work. With a high quality performance by Jamie Foxx, Collateral is a movie that draws viewer interest with relative ease.

One of the most action-packed movies of 2004, Collateral is an unforgettable glimpse into the world of professional assassins. You won't want to miss it... <br /> <br />Los Angeles taxicab driver Max (Jamie Foxx) is an easy to get along with guy, a guy with big dreams of owning his own company and vacationing on a beautiful Caribbean island. When he picks up an unusually beautiful fare, an attorney named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), the two hit it off real well. Before Annie leaves, she hands Max her card and the two agree to go out on a date later. However, Max's next fare has other ideas in mind... <br /> <br />When Max picks up the silver-haired, well-dressed Vincent, he thinks he's got himself just another paying customer. But Max is actually a highly trained professional hit man, and he wants to utilize Max's services for the entirety of the night - as he takes out each of his allotted victims.

As Vincent commits each of his killings, the police follow up with an investigation of their own. Slowly, they put the pieces together. Past killings similar in nature occurred in LA in years past and were always topped off by adead cab driver at the end of the evening. As the cops chase after them, the fate of both Vincent and Max become intertwined. By means of Vincent's manipulations, Max becomes a tool who's enlisted to act in other capacities besides driving. <br /> <br />As the night wears on, and Vincent approaches the conclusion of his killing spree, the identity of his last victim becomes glaringly clear...

With some the best performances of Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise's respective careers, Collateral is a definite must-see film... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0007CNXUU|4.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed Finding Neverland. I thought the acting and story were wonderful and well played. However after doing some research I see again that Hollywood likes to manipulate the facts. Although its True Barrie had a strong connection with the boys in the story, the true story is far more tradgic. Many would liken Barrie to Micheal Jackson in that his love for children may have bordered on paedophilia (a controvery that has surrounded Barrie for a long time), although the boys all denied it and nothing was every proven.  <br /> <br />Tragically one children the oldest, George was killed in WW1, six years later Micheal drowned mysteriously, with his hands were tied to those of his best male Rupert Buxton. Some speculate that the two were gay and commited suicde together, although no one knows for sure.  Peter Davies always resented the character he had inspired and drank himself to poverty and ruin, eventually killing himself by jumping in front of a tube train.  <br /> <br />Other controvery surrounds Barrie. One major one that is not noted in the movie is that Barrie himself forged his name into Sylvia Davies will replacing his name Jimmy with the name of Jenny, a sister of the nurse Mary who looked after Sylvia.  <br /> <br />When Barrie died in 1937 he cut the two surviving brothers (Jack and Nicholas) from his will.  <br /> <br />There is more but find out for yourself if you are interested..... <br /> <br />The more you learn about the truth behind James Barrie the more you see how truely flawed the new movie is. Although dont let this stop you from enjoying it and the story it tells. However out of respect for the real characters involved be sure you understand that this movie is very much fictional and that the real story is far less enchanting, a bit disturbing and truely tragic. However make sure you do your own research and draw your own conclussions!
B0000696ID|5.0|Nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture, E.T. won four Oscars and took the nation by storm upon its release in 1982. A box office sensation, E.T. formed long, around-the-corner lines of fans waiting to get into theaters and propelled child star Drew Barrymore to superstar status. One of director Steven Spielberg's greatest triumphs, E.T. supposedly symbolizes and illustrates feelings of loneliness from the Hollywood icon's youth which resulted from his parents' divorce. A touching story about spirits from differing worlds, E.T. is fun for the entire family. With an original soundtrack (composed by John Williams and winner of an Academy Award), E.T. is a film that thrills its viewers by every means at its disposal... <br /> <br />While visiting Earth late one evening, a spacecraft carrying a group of alien botanist researchers is startled by the approach an elite government task force. Disappearing in a flash, one of the aliens is left behind. As the task force searches the forest for signs of the creature, he appears inside a young boy's tool shed in search of food (such as Reese's Pieces - a product spot way ahead of its time). Discovered by ten-year-old Elliot (Henry Thomas), the extra-terrestrial is nicknamed E.T. and befriends Elliot, his older brother Michael, and his younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore) - all of whom are suffering as a result of their parents' impending divorce... <br /> <br />Hiding E.T. in his room, Elliot successfully manages to hide the secret from his mother, while E.T. slowly learns the customs and ways of the earthling. Building a communication device that will allow him to \\"phone home\\" for help, E.T. begins to run short on time when he catches a deadly disease and his hiding place is discovered by the government task force, which cares only about its ability to study him and not about his life. With Elliot's health now intimately connected to E.T., he begins to suffer as well. Can Elliot and his friends come to E.T.'s aid? Will E.T. escape the clutches of his government captors and return home a healthy, smiling alien? The journey to find out is simply magical... <br /> <br />A true blockbuster and a pop culture phenomenon in its time, E.T. continues to bring joy and inspiration to each new generation of children who see it. Like Spielberg's film The Goonies and the contemporary Harry Potter films, E.T. creates movie magic by unleashing a world of endless imagination where children are the true heroes. In doing so, it unlocks a whole new world of fantasy for the children who watch it... <br /> <br />Easily one of the best 100 films of all time, E.T. is a cinematic masterpiece by any standard of measurement. Spielberg deserves all the praise and accolades he received both then and now. With its widespread, universal appeal and ingenious combination of cinematography and Williams' inspired musical score, E.T. is a definite must-see film... Don't overlook it! <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00005M91K|5.0|This is what Koyaanisqatsi and Chronos grew up to be.  A more mature and diverse film, it is rich and full and makes a magnificent statement.  If you keep an eye on the theatres, you may see the new prints that have been made circulating - at least in Seattle it has played locally in recent years and is not to be missed on the big screen, but even on your TV, prepare a time when you have at least 30 minutes after the film completes to steep in it.  This is great art.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Winner of six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Chicago is a brilliant big screen adaptation of choreographer-director Bob Fosse's 1975 Broadway musical. The story's ingenious jabs at tabloid fame and the fleeting tastes of the popular mindset, omnipresent in the 1920's (the movie's setting) and the 1970's (the date of its writing) is just as relevant today in an age where O.J. Simpson, the Menedez Brothers, and Scott Peterson dominate the pop culture airwaves. Set in Capone's backyard in the midst of the Roaring 20's, Chicago turns in an all-star Hollywood cast and breathes much needed life (i.e. box office success) back into the big screen musical. Viewers won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />Chicago stars Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart. Roxie, wife of sweet, boring Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), has an affair with furniture salesman Fred Casely (Dominic West) who she thinks knows the right people to get her a gig as a singer at a swanky nightclub. But when Roxie finds out that Fred is just using her, she shoots him dead right there in her bedroom. When Amos arrives, he sticks up for Roxie, telling the police that he shot the intruder. At least, until he finds out that the dead man is Fred Casley, the man who recently sold them their furniture. Retracting his story, the police arrest Roxie for Fred Casely's murder. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, sexy songstress and half of a famous Chicago nightclub sister act, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), sits in jail herself awaiting the day of her trial for the murder of her husband and sister (who she caught performing their number \\"the spread eagle\\"). Roxie asks Velma for help, but gets the cold shoulder. But at least one person in the prison is willing to help Roxie. Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton (Queen Latifah), overseer of the woman's prison, will do anything for anyone for the right price. For fifty bucks, she places a phone call to the greatest defense lawyer in modern-day times, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). But a phone call onlygets her in the door. Roxie's husband Amos must come up with the money to pay Billy, which he does prior to being quickly forgotten. <br /> <br />Manipulating the media to the best of his ability, Billy turns Roxie into an overnight celebrity - the hottest sensation to sweep Chicago since, well - since the next one that will come along... Velma Kelly fades from the headlines, and the two rivals compete with each other for the public's and Billy Flynn's attention. <br /> <br />Chicago is a refreshing escape the drudgery of modern day box office blockbusters with its insightful peering into the mob mentality of the public psyche and its colorful characters. Queen Latifah steals the show with her portrayal of Mama Morton in a film packed with knockout performances by Hollywood mainstays. All of the stars sing their own numbers, and the soundtrack is simply spectacular. Broadway purists may be critical of the final product, but no one can doubt that Chicago is as big a hit on screen as it is on stage. Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch this one... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00005JNTV|5.0|After much hassle, I at long last go to see SIN CITY, the movie version of the classic Frank Miller graphic novels. I sit through 20 minutes of previews, including one for HITCHIKER'S GUIDE <br />which I'm excited about (I dig Doug Adams), and the tedious STAR WARS 3 : SITH HAPPENS, which revolted me to no end. <br /> <br />The movie begins. (WARNING: I don't give much away in this review, but at this point I do give away small clips). <br />Love the opening. Great mini which sets up the feel of the city and hence, the feel of the movie. <br />Love the tragic Bruce Willis short. Glad to see Nick Stahls working. <br />Then, we get right to the good stuff: MARV. <br /> <br />The Marv segment steals the show for me, hands down. I love anti-hero stories, I love intense violence and gore, I love insane cannibal stories and I love Mickey Rourke (good to see him in a bigger role again). This segment had it all and then some! Whoever thought Elijah Wood could be scary? Better yet, who ever thought there would be a flick where Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood brawl!?! Marv is a superb anti-hero: he's mean but to the right people, he has self-loathing and a disorder, he reflects on the old days when he kicked everyone's assess, one of his only pals is a lesbian, and he goes nuts when anyone roughs up a woman.  <br />But although he easily takes the cake here, let's not overlook the other goodies. <br /> <br />The next act, featuring the incredible Benico Del Toro, Brittany Murphy and some bloke named Clive who I've only elsewhere seen in I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD (which sucked while I watched), was good but I didn't care for Clive. He was too bland for me. Too David Duchoviny. Other than that, it was smokin'. Benico shined bright as always. <br /> <br />Bruce Willis returns in a wonderful grand finale. I was particularly fond of Nick from IN THE BEDROOM as Junior/Yellow Bastard. What a sickeningly good show he put on. He looked like what would happen if John Malcovitch and Big Bird had a child together and then locked it in a fruit cellar for thirty years. <br /> <br />The stylish noir of the film is genius, the stark B&W with the touches of burning color. It's hypnotic and gorgeous.  Rodriguez redems himself for the hilariously bad ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO. The hard-ass saving the dirty angel theme runs throughout the film but doesn't get old <br />or stale, the violence is over the top and splendidly brutal, and the gore and T&A is aplenty, pleasing the heck out of a depraved maniac like me. <br /> <br />This film gets stars all across the board from me. Although the casting of that  bland bloke Clive in the hooker showdown tale was a bad move, and although Bruce Willis plays an old man and yet nobody thinks to slap some old man make-up on him (even when he ages during the course of the film), the movie over-all is stunningly good and Miller's brillance was wonderfuly transported from the page to the screen. <br />The real stroke of genius here was letting Frank Miller co-direct the movie. Rodriguez (and Tarantino, somewhere) aided with the techincal and camera direction aspect  but Miller repainted the mood of his graphic novels. This is why it came out so  good, unlike the bastardized versions of comics which hit theaters without consultation <br />of the original creators (doody-tanks like THE PUNISHER and THE HULK). Rami did great on the SPIDER-MAN films because he was such a hardcore fanboy, but normally such dedication to the original artisty isn't present and directors think they have ways to improve the original story, and then they, in the end, ruin them. <br /> <br />BATMAN BEGINS was originaly based on Frank Miller's BATMAN: YEAR ONE. While BATMAN BEGINS still looks to have some promise, it likely would have been better if they had worked with Miller on it. Miller was one of the best things to ever happen to Batman. We'll see if Christian Bale cuts the mustard or if he simply cuts the cheese. <br />So far, I have mixed feelings about it. It looks good overall, but Bale looks so much like Kilmer in the suit. This seems like a bad omen. Don't get me wrong, I like Bale. AMERICAN PSYCHO was great! But <br />Bale as Batman? I don't know about that. <br /> <br />Anyway, SIN CITY was the best movie I've seen in a very, very long time. I highly, highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys crime, noir, horror and overall fun movies. <br />
6305736650|5.0|One of the greatest, and certainly one of the most quoted, films in cinema history, Casablanca brings all the essential elements to the big screen - adventure, romance, intrigue, suspense, and of course, evil Nazi bad guys (if you doubt this last one as an essential element, then reference the success of the Indiana Jones films). With a director and cast second to none, Casablanca makes a strong case for consideration as the best movie ever made - cementing its status as a must-see film.<br /><br />The story begins in a place called Rick's, a popular watering hole in Vichey controlled Morocco on the outskirts of Nazi dominated Europe. An important travel hub, Casablanca plays host to innumerable colorful characters with any number of varying agendas. Arms dealers, spies, and revolutionaries walk side-by-side through streets littered with pickpockets. But at Rick's, everyone seems to enjoy themselves. Owner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) seems content with his life of serving customers and making money until she walks in - Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), the love of his life.<br /><br />A couple of years earlier, as the Nazis moved into Paris, Rick and Ilsa fell in love. But in the act of fleeing the Nazi advance, Ilsa sent Rick a note at the train station informing him that she could not go with him. She offered no explanation. Now, she was appearing in his establishment with her husband - fugitive and Nazi resistance leader Victor Laszlo.<br /><br />As the hours unfold, and the Nazis search for Laszlo in an attempt to cut off his escape, Rick learns the whole story. When he met Ilsa in Paris she was married to Laszlo, but she thought he was dead - a victim of the Nazi regime. But before she could flee Paris with Rick, she learned that her husband had escaped a Nazi concentration camp. She stayed behind to care for him.<br /><br />Needing help to aid her husband's escape to the United States, Ilsa appeals to Rick. It is clear that they still love each other. But will Rick use his influence and connections to help himself and Ilsa or Victor Laszlo? Will his idealism prevail over his hard pragmatism? The Third Reich is closing in on Victor Laszlo and only Rick can save him...<br /><br />The DVD Report
B00009V7P8|5.0|Like I said in this title, this cd is simpily beautiful. From the acoustic guitar picking and strumming, to the violin's being beautifully bowed, to the song \\"Cheers Darlin'\\" where a clarinet is cleverly played ending with a piano that is played as if it were sad. The vocals on this cd are beautiful as well, Damien Rice and Lisa Hannigan's voices mingle together almost in a sexual way seducing your ears while you listen gracefully. The last track of the album almost seems maybe kind of ordinary until Doreen Curran wailes in opera, fitting perfectly as if the last piece of a beautiful puzzle picture. All in all this cd samples a vast variety of music genre's and almost creating a new one all at once.
B00003CX95|5.0|Long before The Passion of the Christ, Mel Gibson directed another cinematic masterpiece - Braveheart. Filmed against the backdrop of majestic mountains and rolling meadows, it tells the historically-based story of William Wallace, a common man's warrior who led the Scottish people in rebellion against King Edward I \\"Longshanks\\".  <br /> <br />Set in the 11th Century, Braveheart catalogues the struggle Scottish serfs faced under the brutal oppression of England. Against this backdrop, William Wallace (Mel Gibson) falls in love with Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack). Insistent that he will not share his wife (proclamation by the king gives local rulers first-night rights to new brides), Wallace secretly marries Murron in the dark of night. But when an English knight assaults her, Wallace sparks a fight. Fleeing the village, Wallace thinks that Murron has escaped and will soon meet him in their secret rendezvous point. But Murron is captured and put to death the king's emissaries. <br /> <br />Angered at his wife's murder, Wallace starts a small rebellion, slaughtering all of the king's loyalists in the village. The rebellion quickly grows with more and more men joining each day. Distraught, Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan) dispatches the Northern Army to destroy Wallace and his followers. Wallace delivers a stirring speech to rouse his men, and he employs an ingenious battlefield trick to defeat the king's cavalry. The Wallace rebellion continues unhindered as York is sacked and the rebels approach the heart of England. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Longshanks sends his daughter-in-law, Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) on a peace mission to meet with Wallace. On the king's behalf, she offers him gold, land, anything he wants if he will only stop the rebellion. She and her servants are greatly impressed with the sophistication displayed by Wallace, who speaks fluent French and does not resemble his barbarian myth. <br /> <br />Wallace turns down the offer made by Princess Isabelle, but he knows that he can not win Scottish freedom on his own. He needs the support of the noblemen. The leader of the nobles is Robert the Bruce (Angus MacFadyen) who struggles against his own idyllic view of the world and his father's pessimistic pragmatism. After much struggle, Robert decides to work with Wallace, but remains unaware that his father has betrayed Wallace into the hands of Longshanks. <br /> <br />As Longshanks lies on his deathbed, his daughter-in-law whispers in his ear that the child she is carrying belongs to William Wallace. In the courtyard outside the king's room, the executioners encircle Wallace. He is brutally tortured, but refuses to swear allegiance to Longshanks. Instead, he issues the clarion call of \\"Freedom!\\" inspiring his countrymen to fight for and win their independence...  <br /> <br />With a brilliant array of costumes, vivid battle scenes, and a noble hero at its center, Braveheart is more than just a movie. It's a part of history. It's call for freedom and belief that some things are worth risking life and limb for strikes a cord within every viewer. In fact, the movie led to a revival in nationalistic pride that fueled the successful Scottish independence movement of the 1990s. A thousand years later, the enduring legacy of William Wallace is still transforming the European landscape. And Mel Gibson captures the passion of Wallace with an Academy Award winning masterpiece of a film... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0002S947K|5.0|Ray LaMontagne has got himself a voice indeed. Acoustic guitar with a soulful voice makes this cd. The lyrics are pretty good and heart felt as well. I found out about Ray from watching Late Night with Conan O'brian and he was performing \\"Trouble\\", I then researched Ray on Amazon, listened to some samples, and that was enough for me to buy this wonderful album. Get this album it's great. Oh yeah, and find Jesus to.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I'm not as familiar with this story as the other reviewers here, but I have read all the classic Greek myths when I was little. So even I have forgotten most of the stories, but part of the stories are still in my mind, and it helped me understanding the storyline of the movie. Fortunately, my favorite character, Achilles, is the one that I still remember. I remember after he was born, his mother, Thetis, wanted to make him immortal. She held him by one heel and immersed him in the river Styx. Since her hand held his heel, the magic water did not touch it. Therefore, his heel remained mortal. In order to kill him, one had to hurt his heel.  <br />The Trojan War lasted about 10 years, however, in this movie, they seemed to have shortened the war in just a week or so. I don't know if Achilles was a handsome guy. But after watching this movie, I believe he must have been. Brad Pitt was charming and he was also a leading man in this movie. I enjoyed watching him fighting and talking. But the love story between him and Briseis was lame. I don't know how a man as charming and proud as Achilles would fall in love with her. At first, I thought he was just flirting because he was bored. When I saw the end, Achilles died for the reason of this woman because he was looking for her in order to save her while the city of Troy was smashed down, I thought that went a bit too far and was not believable. A woman shouldn't be the reason for his death. He should have died for a more glorious reason. <br />I also liked Hector, played by Eric Bana. Hector was a loving, responsible son, father, husband, brother, and Prince. Eric Bana made me believe he was Hector.  <br />They have excluded all the Gods that originally were in Homer's Iliad. I think it's better to do it this way. It makes it more historical; makes it like it had happened 3000 years ago. Otherwise, it would become another Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. I liked it more than Gladiator. Gladiator was too violent. Originally, I thought this movie must be too, but it turned out not so bad. The fighting was quick and not too bloody. It focuses more on love and passion.  <br />
B00005GL0P|5.0|George said: \\"Rubber Soul was my favourite album, even at that time. I think that it was the best one we made; we certainly knew we were making a good album. We did spend a bit more time on it and tried new things. But the most important thing about it was that we were suddenly hearing sounds that we weren't able to hear before. Also, we were being more influenced by other people's music and everything was blossoming at that time; including us, because we were still growing.\\"     I couldn't agree more. Rubber Soul has everything I look for in an album: 3 John's masterpieces which in my opinion are among the best 10 songs the Beatles ever recorded (\\"Norwegian Wood\\"; \\"Nowhere Man\\"; \\"In My Life\\"), beautiful ballads (\\"Michelle\\"; \\"Girl\\"), a great rocker (\\"Drive My Car\\"), Paul's 'nasty' anti-love songs (\\"You Won't See Me\\"; \\"I'm Looking Through You\\"), the first 2 essential George's tunes (\\"Think For Yourself\\"; \\"If I Needed Someone\\") and the funky, first 'flower power' song ever (\\"The Word\\").     I love this album so much that I even did a whole web site about it:     [...]     Honestly, I think that Rubber Soul fans will enjoy this site.
0425170349|5.0|I loved the book.  Clancy spends a lot of time setting up the story, but with action all throughout the story, you hardly notice it.  This is definately my favorite of Clancy's books. I've played the video games and just can't get enough of either the book or the games.
B0008JFMEC|3.0|Unless Sony does several things to make this much more enticing. First they need to drop the price.  Ten to fifteen dollars seems good for a no frills version of a movie you might already own on DVD. I also recommend DVD/UMD packages for new releases. I for one would not mind paying 29.99 for both the DVD and UMD version together in one package. This way its not like paying twice for the same film, instead you're saving money so that you don't have to buy the movie on UMD. Sony obviously didn't think this idea through because the Memory card can hold movies, as cumbersome as that process is, and sooner or later someone is going to come out with re-writable UMD's so that you can burn it on your comp and play it on the PSP.  <br /> <br />So let's review. <br /> <br />1)Drop the price. <br /> <br />2)Create DVD/UMD bundles <br /> <br />3)Create re-writable UMD's.   <br /> <br /> Wake up sony we already own these movies and we aren't itchin to double dip on versions of the film that don't come even come with features. If you don't make this feature more interesting and fast the UMD film idea will die faster than laserdiscs.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This is the brilliant 4-part tv miniseries 'Lonesome Dove', caught on DVD.  It is the story of a group of cowboys, led by long time best friends Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call, trying to push a herd of cattle across the United States, from Texas to Montana.  With stars such as Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, and Angelica Houston, you are sure to have a quality movie.   <br /> <br />I won't deny it -- I'm not a Western fan.  But this movie has changed my entire perspective.  I would have to say that this is my all time favourite movie.  It has all the basic elements - action, adventure, comedy, love, drama... combined to create one of the most amazing films of our time.  I never really knew much about the heart of american history, the wild west, until I saw this movie.   <br /> <br />In some ways, I compare this film to the 'Lord of The Rings' series, in that most of the movie is literally gripping (other than the slow start at the beginning - in both movies), and at the end of each part, excluding the last, you feel very compelled to watch the next.  I have yet to meet someone who stopped watching the series part way through.  Other Westerns give this movie a bad name.  My joy gets a little more crunched every time I hear someone say that they hate westerns, therefore they would hate Lonesome Dove.  This is the way a real western should be.   <br /> <br /> <br />Words cannot express how great this movie is.  I cannot stress the fact enough, and though I keep recommending this film to my friends and family, I wish everybody had the opportunity to experience the joy...  This is not a very well known movie, and I do not understand why -- I've seen hundreds of movies, and this old classic is still #1 in my books.  I guarantee that you will enjoy it, if you give it a chance.

0385504209|5.0|I'm glad I follow my friends' suggestion to read this book. It was a revelation for me :) The idea and statement forwarded in this book is the first for me. Although some people say that not all of the info is true but just the whole idea is provoking and plausible. I'm going to check them out on ther books. Well, you can not read the Bible (specially New Testament) with the same light now.<br /><br />Dan Brown has managed to bring the data and not just made it in boring essay but into a thriller and mystery.<br /><br />But this book is not perfect. Actually I want to give this book less than 5 because the main characters need to be worked up a bit because of their inconsistency response to problem at hand. Specially agent Sophie Neveu that I felt too slow at the beginning for a French CIA's agent but nearing the end, suddenly to self confident. If that was used to array the clue from Langdon, I think Mr.Brown could use another method than slowing her down.
0385510454|3.0|I not only like Grisham's books, but I admire Grisham. He doesn't manipulate his readers with the sleaze, sex and gore other writers of thrillers seem to think is requisite to a good story. Grisham's books always have a point, which is up to the reader to devine and appreciate, or not. While I think he got off to a good start with this one, and had a few inventive twists going at times, it almost seemed as though he just gave out at some point and got tired of writing. All his elaborate setup just collapsed. I had my mouth open near the end, thinking, \\"That's it? But....\\" Still, I don't regret a minute I spent reading the book and will buy his next one hot off the press.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones is a touching novel about grief, love, forgiveness and moving on. 14 year old Susie Salmon is brutally raped and murdered by a disturbed neighbor, and goes up to heaven. From her heaven (where everything is just what she wants it to be), she can watch her family, her friends, and even her killer and their actions after her death. She watches painfully as her killer tries to befriend her father, and the falling apart of her family, each as they try to deal with their own grief. The novel is also filled with flashbacks, as Susie remembers her family in the past (when she was with them) and comparing it with the present.  Whilst her family cannot let go of her, she in turn cannot let go of them, and Alice Sebold tells the story in a way that makes Susie's situation seem completely believable.  <br /> <br /> The author Alice Sebold, who was raped whilst at University, has known a lot of grief and torment, and illustrates this in the Lovely Bones, her first novel. It is unlike any other text, and has an extremely original approach, written from the point of view of a dead person. It has many themes, the main one being that of grief. It explores how different people deal with their grief, caused by the same event, and the way in which they try to move on. Susie's father goes on a desperate hunt to find her killer, her mothers withdrawal from the family and begins an affair in attempt to separate herself from reality, her sister matures at a startling rate and almost becomes the support pillar of the family, and one of Susie's friends enters the world of the spirits, believing she can once again make contact with her (Susie) in this way. The novel looks at relationships within the family, and shows typical situations of affairs, parents breaking up, and the affect this has on the children.  It also explores forgiveness, at first through Susie and how she feels about her killer, and then through her father forgiving her mother so that they once again cantry and be a whole family. Love is a big theme in the novel, and the author is trying to get the point to her audience that only through love can people truly move on, and she shows this by that until the family can learn to love one another again they can not let go of Susie.  <br /> <br /> The style in which this book is written is blunt, simplistic and unsentimental, though at the same time painfully moving. As it is written \\"by a 14 year old girl\\" it  often merely states the facts and does not have much emotional language, though the events it describes are very emotional. At times it is humorous however the book can sometimes travel at quite a slow pace, and the flashbacks mixed with reality can sometimes be confusing. The characters are all very realistic, and none are perfect, the faults of each shown clearly throughout the novel. At its beginning the book seems quite tragic as it just shows sadness through a probably preventable death although by the end all the characters are happy, and almost too happy for the general tone of the text. <br /> <br /> This book could be quite a good one to be studied by a class, as it has very clear themes which could be studied at different depths. It is not an extremely challenging read, but it is not easy either (and quite long). As it is from the point of view of a teenager, it has aspects which class members could relate to (especially family relationships). However, though it has strong themes and is a book with substantial depth, the themes are not quite the debatable ones which are ideal for a class novel. It would be hard to take a \\"stance\\" on any particular theme in the novel, except possibly the quick look into the \\"spiritual world\\".  <br />  <br /> Overall, this book is a very original, moving and interesting read. Though at points it is slightly confusing, and can move at quite a slow pace, it is unlike almost any other book and so would be good for readers of all ages for a view of life from a different perspective.  <br />
6305428352|5.0|Most people are shocked when I rank this as one of my all-time favorite movies.  I am shocked when I find out how few have seen this movie!  It is such a great film.  I cry at three points in the movie, it never fails.  You know you've found gold when you've seen a movie twenty or more times and still cry at the emotional scenes.  EVERY TIME.  It's a true sign of brilliant acting and directing. <br /> <br />This movie is extremely realistic, although it can be a bit cheesy sometimes.  But the corny parts are not so sickening that you want to turn off the movie... they are endurable and even cute.
B0007GAERG|1.0|If you're hoping for the style of music that made Mariah Carey famous, you're going to be tremendously disappointed.  It appears that Ms. Carey has forever sacrificed her talents to the wishes of some rap producer somewhere, and settled for song after song of mindless drivel, set to the unoriginal, monotonous beat of a drum machine.  There is virtually nothing redeeming or remarkable about this album, and the hoopla you're hearing about it is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the recording studio to sell as many copies of this as possible, before the word gets out about what a stinker it is and people quit buying it. <br /> <br />To Mariah Carey I offer this sage bit of advice: fire your rapper managers and producers and go back to singing ballads and happy songs with a peppy beat.  Anyone and their brother can rap, and it's a colossal waste of your talent to keep making such drivel as this.  Get Walter Afanasieff back on your team and stop trying to prove anything.  Sing, dammit!
B000059PPN|5.0|When i first saw this film on video way back in the early 8os, i thought it was a pile of smudgy ,worm infested pile of crap.It lured me in with it's lurid poster on the video shops shelf among all the great tacky films we love today.So whats changed?  Firstly, the video version was full screen and worn and cut. Now that it is on dvd we can all see it in widescream digitallllly mastered and uncut. It is like watching another film, and i must say, i think it is one of Fulcis best films. Full of poetry, atmosphere and creepy menace. Yes it may be tacky in parts and some scenes tend to rely on over the top gore, but this is what makes this film so unique. It's unpredictable and has an almost homemade feel about it that you just don't get anymore from films. Maybe Jess Franco. but he never made a film like this. A film that could only have come out of Italy at that most cherished of times the 80s, and offering somthing that America could never duplicate with all it's millions, and for that it should be appreciated. Go seek it out.
B00003CXC7|5.0|This is a wonderful film, brilliantly cast, top to bottom! It works so marvelously well, in so many ways! <br /> <br />First, it conveys SUMMER! The heat is palpable.  <br /> <br />It is a beautiful portrayal of a functional neighborhood. The courtyard of Jimmy Stewart's building circumscribes the lives of its inhabitants, as Stewart's own apartment circumscribes his own life. <br /> <br />Ths film is tense and suspenseful. The plot is easy going until---wham!!!---there you are in incredibly tight suspense. <br /> <br />The film is serious, and it is comic! May we particularly commend Raymond Burr (a BADDDD villain), Thelma Ritter (the quintessential comic housekeeper), Gracy Kelly (the stylish, hot, but human heroine), and Jimmy Stewart (easy going, but persistent). <br /> <br />This is absolutely Hitchcock at his very best! Get it now!!!

B00006LJ6X|4.0|This was my favorite album of all time when I was a 15-year-old trumpet player in the mid-70s.  It doesn't hold up quite as well now, but I'm still glad I finally got this on CD.  All seven members of Chicago contributed to the songwriting, and the album marked the beginning of Cuban percussionist Laudir DeOliveira's stint as an unofficial eighth member.  Originally a two-LP set, most of the first record is jazz-rock instrumentals, with the highlight being \\"Aire\\", a 7/8 time piece with a beautiful brass melody and a solid guitar solo by Terry Kath.  The 10-minute \\"Devil's Sweet\\" is more of an acquired taste.  The band transitions to pop at the end of the first LP with \\"Life Saver\\" and Peter Cetera's \\"Happy Man\\", and stays in pop mode for the second LP.  \\"Happy Man\\" is one chorus short of a load, but otherwise could have made a good single.  Cetera sings on all three of the album's hit singles, and all three are excellent songs:  \\"(I've Been) Searchin' So Long\\", \\"Call on Me\\", and \\"Wishing You Were Here\\", a haunting tune where Cetera invited the Beach Boys to do their thing with the backing vocal arrangement.  Trumpeter Lee Loughnane gets to sing lead on Kath's tribute to winter, \\"Song of the Evergreens\\".  Trombonist James Pankow contributes the upbeat, Latin-tinged instrumental \\"Mongonucleosis\\".  Pianist Bobby Lamm's songs include much of the album's weaker material, except for the catchy \\"Woman Don't Want to Love Me\\" -- his \\"Skinny Boy\\", which features the Pointer Sisters, was later the title tune of a solo album. <br /> <br />Lyrics were never Chicago's strong suit, and the ones on this album are pretty weak.  The early 70s must have been a strange time for relationships.  The lyric of \\"Call on Me\\", like \\"Feelin' Stronger Every Day\\" on the previous album, boils down to \\"I love you, but I'm dumping you anyway.\\"  On Kath's \\"Byblos\\", the singer falls for one woman, blows her off in a bar to talk to another woman, and when she goes off with someone else instead, is soheartbroken that \\"then I went home and I got it on, sat down to write these words when I was finally alone.\\"  This remastered edition includes interesting liner notes by Phil Gallo and a previously unissued rehearsal version of \\"Byblos\\".  The pop material here is as good as any Chicago ever did, and the instrumentals hold up to repeated listening better than a lot of the ones on earlier albums.  To me, \\"Chicago VII\\" is the debut album's biggest competition for Chicago's best album. <br /> <br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal) <br />
1591396190|5.0|You should not have to compete in the red ocean of head-to-head competition; the alternative is to create a new space in the market that will attract new customers. Such a strategy involves value innovation-the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy. Those that seek blue oceans pursue differentiation and low cost simultaneously. The authors studied 150 strategic moves between 1880 and 2000-not companies or industries-to understand the patterns by which blue oceans are created and high performance is achieved. The authors' aim is to make the formulation and execution of blue ocean strategy as systematic and actionable as traditional competition. The book goes on to examine six principles of blue ocean strategy, discussed from page 21 onward, ending with a brief chapter on sustainability and renewal of blue ocean strategy. As a consultant in organization and compensation (Stern & Associates), I was particularly impressed with how this book incisively addresses the HUMAN side of strategy execution. The authors have written a wonderfully clear and insightful book that sheds a bright light on the alternative to traditional strategy. It is filled with ideas to savor.

6305161879|2.0|Well, after Python, John Cleese and Michael Palin decided to go more into 'serious' comedy with this film, A Fish Named Wanda.  The story is about a group of four who successfully steal some diamonds, but then, as all good burglars do, turn against each other only to fall into complication upon complication. <br /> <br />The film has a decent amount of big names, such as Kevin Kline, John Cleese, and Jamie Lee Curtis.  However, I just never really got into this.  The plot is well twisted so that is not the problem; however, I just lack the interest in the characters. <br /> <br />First of all, Michael Palin is just going off of the stuttering bit he did in Life of Brian. Moreover, and I never understood how anyone could be, every male character is heads over heels for Curtis, which just seems so unrealistic to me even in a plot.  Really though, the 'comedy' just was not that funny, except for a bit of semi-absurdity near the end. <br /> <br />Thus, I would advise a different movie.  I do not really know which one, but particularly something different.
B0000C7PQK|2.0|I have been listening to ENIGMA since way back in 1990. Coming from a country  ( COSTA RICA ) where most people listen to salsa ,merengue and more \\" tropical \\" rhythms I was certainly one of those few enigma fans.  During the last years I have enjoyed all of Mr. Cretu's releases :  Le Roi est mort, The Cross of Changes , The Screen Behind the Mirror, etc..  Even the DVD which has that beautiful video of the monk being tempted in SADENESS ( but that is another story, hehe) Going back to the review, I really don't get what or where is Mr. Cretu going with his new project. I can understand artist's constantly  \\"evolve\\" but this VOYAGEUR album leaves me with a bitter taste. Let's see what  will happen  with the next album. I just hope it has no Boum -Boum elements...
B00001U0DP|5.0|This movie combines the horror and tragedy of the holocaust, and comedy. It may sound odd, but amazingly enough, the director has done it. This movie will make you laugh and cry. It will touch your heart. (I never cry during movies, and I mean never. But I did during this one, and thats saying something...) I highly reccomend you watching this movie. You won't regret it!    ;)
0802130208|5.0|Laugh out loud funny. Try the book on audio, as well. Very well done.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Ok, I missed this release at the cinemas, but everyone that I knew who wanted to see it went on about how others who saw it found it really funny and how much they wanted to see it.  <br /> <br />Comes the release on DVD and I get all excited, time to sit down and check out this laugh-a-rama. Grab some ice cream, grab a comfy chair and wack in the DVD. <br /> <br />What can I say, there is absolutely nothing funny about this particular movie (Tell a lie, there is one scene that almost got a smile out of me when Pedro smiles towards the end...possably becuase it is the only emotion that looks genuine) least in so far as I am concerned. Apparently there are people out there who enjoyed it (And yes you may be such a person) but for myself, the humour value just didn't exist. <br /> <br />So to be fair, who is most likely going to enjoy this movie? That's a hard question to answer becuase I missed the point of it all, based on the type of person who I have spoken to who did get a kick out of it, it appears that those who belittle Hollywood (Such would include people who prefer the original foreign produced film over the Hollywood remakes of such films for no other reason than it wasn't produced by Hollywood), who believe in the good fight against commercialism (the fact that there are vote for Pedro t-shirts available leaves me wondering though) and that no independant film can do any wrong would be the key audience that would find this particular movie enjoyable (Rise up and rebel against the mainstream). Perhaps my enjoyment of this movie was dampened by the fact that I do not view myself as elitest with a need to prove my intellectual superiority or perhaps it is due to my wide ranging enjoyment of movies (Yes...I watch most films that hit the cinemas were I am, many of which are bad (Ugh...only thing worse is seeing a bad movie in a bad cinema that smells), some that are good and I have been doing so a few decades now so yes, perhaps I am just jaded). <br /> <br />If your aged 10-16 (Which fits the age group of the majority of viewers who said to me it was funny), chances are you may like it as you sympathise with Napoleon Dynamite and his dreary life. Fans over this age bracket seem to be more in line with the anti-hollywood crowd, many of which took great pleasure in pointing out that fact. <br /> <br />If you don't like deadpan humour (chances are you wont even spot the humour if this is the case), this film is a definite miss. <br /> <br />If you think your smarter than the average Joe, then hey, maybe you will get something I certainly didn't and you'll love this movie.
B0007GAERG|1.0|This is Mariah's worst performance and recording to date.  The singing and music tempo is equivalent to a pregnant hog delivering 14 whining piglets.  Each of the 14 songs are practically identical in sound and voice.  Don't expect to hear exciting fresh high crisp singing and quick beat.  It has the distasteful rhythm associated with a street punk hoodlum tapping a Casio keyboard and bobbing his head while stoned out of his mind.  I imagine an organ grinder pumping out the same tune over and over while Mariah climbs up and down apartment balconies begging for money with a tin cup.  This will be my last impression of her career.  Do not waste your money.
B00005YTN5|5.0|This 2CD reissue contains all of the original lineup's commercially released recordings.  Period.  That includes Stereo and Mono mixes in addition to all of the 45rpm singles & B-sides.  The singles & B-sides ARE different than the \\"LP\\" mono versions, both in length and the mix.  Your VU collection should, without question, begin with this 2CD set.<br /><br />Personally, I think the Mono mixes sound better than Stereo mixes!<br /><br />To the reviewer who said NOT to buy this reissue, the reason why the Nico solo tracks were included was because Lou, Cale, and Sterling had a lot to do with those tracks, from the writing to the production.  You are right, Nico's work needs to stand alone to be truly appreciated, but those tracks from Chelsea Girl are basically the result of a VU \\"side-project.\\"  It worked, too.<br /><br />There are a number of people selling this for well below its original $25+ price tag.  Take advantage and make the purchase.

B0001AP12G|3.0|Yeah, I know; it's really late for me to be listening to Kanye West's album The College Dropout for the first time, but I thought I'd put in my two cents anyway. Now, some people might want to give me an unhelpful vote already because I rated it less than four stars, but...well, while Kanye does bring the heat for the most part, there are times when he tends to get a little corny (which is evidenced by when he guest stars on any non-Roc-A-Fella album; Jadakiss' \\"Gettin' It In\\", anyone?).<br /><br />But back to the album at hand. The singles are definitely standouts, like the interesting story \\"All Falls Down\\" and the autobiographical \\"Through the Wire\\". And \\"Jesus Walks\\" is good too, but the only thing that bothers me is that if it's a song about Jesus...WHY IS THERE PROFANITY IN IT??? Anyway, \\"Slow Jamz\\" is also here, but it's a slightly different version: Jamie Foxx does some talking at the beginning, there's a longer break after Kanye's verse, and Twista's final verse is cut out. Oh well, it's still enjoyable, but I can't say the same about \\"The New Workout Plan\\" (sorry, I never liked that song).<br /><br />There are still some other standouts, like when Kanye dwells on family life in tracks like \\"Never Let Me Down\\" and \\"Family Business\\". One of the album's best moments is when Talib Kweli and Common join him for \\"Get `Em High\\"; the only problem is that Kanye loses steam during the second verse.<br /><br />And that actually leads me to the bad news. This album is 76 minutes long, and it could have been shorter if he had trimmed the filler, especially the skits; they all suck. The most annoying one would have to be \\"School Spirit Skit 1\\", which appeared to make a lot of reviewers upset, as it joked about how a college education may not necessarily get you anyplace (the song that follows, \\"School Spirit\\", is in the same vein; by the way, why is that song censored?). And the autobiographical stories earlier on the album were fine, but \\"Last Call\\" just drags on and on. I mean, the song is over twelve minutes long, and only the first three or four minutes is actual rapping; the rest is Kanye talking, and after a while I was like, \\"Shut UP!\\" And \\"Spaceship\\" is a little too out-there (although I do like Consequence's verse).<br /><br />While Kanye West did very well prove that producers ARE capable of making multi-platinum albums, I still think this album was a little overhyped. I don't know when his next album is coming out because judging by recent interviews, it's clear that he needs to check his ego at the door, but The College Dropout is still good for bumpin' in your stereo.<br /><br />Anthony Rupertand on.

0064400018|5.0|I gave this book five stars because my teacher Mrs. Brown reads them to us and they keep on getting more interesting. I also like them because it tells you how Laura lived long ago in the olden days. I wish I could have every book made by her. It also teaches you about history back then. I also found out that in one of the books that Laura's baby brother dies and gets a baby sister. So, I wish that everybody in the world could have these fantastic books by Laura Ingalls Wilder.
B000002GYI|5.0|During the days of WLIR, this was a staple album.  The music was totally 80's.  \\"Numbers\\" was a classic jam.  \\"Home Computer\\" was a song that saw the future.  Kraftwerk was a group that was innovative to the electonic dance wave scene.  This CD is a testament to all who long for the days of their youth in the early 80's.  Excellent!!

It was Joss Whedon's reputation, and my enjoyment of his previous shows that drew me.    \\"Firefly\\" is a space opera of sorts, taking place in a Western (as in cowboys) themed universe, where many earth cultures have blended together. Characters lapse into Chinese when cursing. There is a school of thought among sf fandom that, when a show has to resort to the cowboy episode (as the original Battlestar Galactica series did in the first season), the writers are truly lost for ideas. I had mixed feelings about the show's merits, until I got into it a bit.    If I were to take \\"Firefly\\" too seriously, I think it's a show I'd probably detest, but 30 minutes of viewing convinced me that Joss Whedon had a sense of humor about him when conceiving and executing this short-lived series.    The \\"Firefly\\" universe is a universe populated by rogue space cowboys, escorts, religious fanatics and a somewhat under-explained political struggle loosely mirroring Star Wars' The Empire and Rebellion. There's irony everywhere, some truly cheesy writing (and acting) and some great special effects.    While I enjoyed the campiness of the show, I'd hate to leave the reader with the impression that the sometimes over-the-top humor is the only reason to watch. There are some truly superlative moments, running the gamut from tense to heart breaking. The interlaced humor serves not only the audience in making the show more enjoyable, but the character development as well.    Overall, \\"Firefly\\" is probably one of the best sf shows I've ever seen. Take any aspect of the show and drop it into another reference frame, and one would run for cover. Somehow, Whedon manages to pull all of these strange odds and ends together into a cohesive unit that is really entertaining.    Aside from the episodes, the extras on the DVD (including the gag reel) are well worth viewing, though - truth be told - I could probably go a lifetime without hearing the theme song again.    While it helps to watch the episodes in order, once the characters are explained, each episode is great for stand-alone viewing. \\"Firefly\\" could probably have lasted a couple more seasons before deteriorating, and I wish it had.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Ok for starters, I am the most dogmatic person when it comes to the music I listen to.  I used to H.A.T.E Slipknot, I would actually make fun of kids that listened to it.  I always thought they were just immature, down-tuned, screaming, worthless mask wearing garbage.  Latley I have been angry and really grown a liking to them, and this is by far one of their best albums.  Corey is an AMAZING singer and he really gets to show off his talent through this album.  I really like heavy music, but its always nice to hear a band mellow out and make an awesome melodic ballad type song.  Vermilion pt. 2 is a great song, very emotional and a great highlight of how slipknot is going out on a limb to help prove that they can play more than down-tuned powercords with nothing but screaming.  AWESOME ALBUM, worth the $$
1592400876|4.0|If you're someone who spends a lot of time lamenting the use of English in public places...the person who groans whenever an apostrophe is used incorrectly or sighs at the sight of a split infinitive, then you'll love it.  If you don't know what any of the above means, then read this one and you'll soon understand what it's like to be a language nut.  It's an easy read, and very informative; in other words, it's worth your time.
B000084T18|5.0|There is no denying that this is a great album, all the haters are either annoyed of him or are jealous of how much money he is getting. and i personally think that he would be just as good without Eminem and Dre. and by the way this is NOT 50 Cent's first album, alot of people probably don't even no that. \\"Power of The Dollar\\" and \\"Guess Who's Back\\" are 2 other 50 Cent albums which are very good, and there are few mixtapes also... <br />\\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" is hot!, the beats along with the lyrics are tight, and the featured artists do a great job and no skits which is great. <br />My Favourite Tracks are \\"Many Men\\" \\"If I Can't\\" \\"Heat\\" \\"What Up Gangsta\\" \\"P.I.M.P.\\" \\"Gotta Make It To Heavan\\" and \\"Like My Style\\". \\"21 Questions\\" with Nate is very good also and \\"In Da Club\\" which is a song everyone knows, is an alright song, and was a good way to get noticed. The Bonus Tracks are all great also (\\"Wanksta\\", \\"U Not Like Me\\" and \\"Life's on the Line\\") <br />\\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" is a great album, and 50 won't be goin anywhere, having brought out since then \\"Beg For Mercy\\" (which wasnt great) and \\"The Massacre\\" which is still number 1 on the Billboard Charts, 50 has cemented himself in the Spotlight and looks like he will be staying there. <br /> <br />I Recommend this album \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" to u all along with his other releases (Power of The Dollar, Guess Who's Back, and The Massacre).
6302767741|5.0|I had read several negative reviews and so was prepared for the worst, but the fabulous performance of Hugh Laurie in TV's \\"House\\" convinced me to give this film a try.  The movie was wonderful: heartfelt, funny, sad, hopeful and exasperating.  All the things real friends are.  As expected, Laurie was grand as were Fry and Branaugh, but also deserving of mention is the wonderfully droll performance of Phyllida Law, Emma Thompson's real-life mother, as the wise cook.
0316666343|2.0|When I first started the book I was hooked. Not just because of what was happening to Susie Salmon but all in all it was very touching, and moving. But towards the middle and the end of the book I must say I was struggling to finish. I even put it up for a few weeks and then went back to finish it up. Good but not all the hype that it has been given.
0670033375|1.0|I was very dissapointed in this book. Though the concept is intriguing, the writing style is tedious and repetitive. It is said that Social scientists in an effort to ensure their scholarship is recognised, often obfuscate their material to try to make the point. This book is a fine example of that phenomena.<br /><br />Still a good editor could have probably saved this book. Alas that was not the case. Good book to put you to sleep though.
0767830555|5.0|I dont normally review things because I dont have the word power to express things like other reviewers do, but I have to say something. First of all, Taxi Driver is my favorite movie. Everything is perfect in this movie. I wont go into detail. I was browsing through the comments to see if anyone could say something negative about this classic and to my suprise I found some. I saw that someone said they ending ruined the movie. I was completely in awe when I saw that. The ending just makes this movie even better. The final shootout is one of the most poetic killing scenes ive ever seen. I also saw someone who rated the acting and violence low. This goes along with that one reviewer who said the thing about the fast and furious people. Deniros acting was so amazing. No one could probably play Travis Bickle as well as he could. I guess he didnt know that Robert made up the You Talkin To Me saying, which has become one of the most famous sayings in our time. And the violence, think about it, it was late seventies, they werent exactly making every movie a Triple X Vin Diesel action movie yet. My closing comment will be to the person who said he was porn loving. If you recall the scene where he took Betsy to the porn movie thinking everyone could enjoy it and then says he really doesnt know anything about movies is an obvious hint that the poor guy doesnt know a good one from a bad one.
0316172324|3.0|_Blink_ is certainly an entertaining read, and the author does an excellent job of staying on track and using many different areas of study to buttress his major topic.  However, the book never provides a payoff of WHAT should be done now.  According to Gladwell, \\"thin-slicing\\" is good, unless it's not good.  It's good when it works, but otherwise it's bad.  There's no step forward here, and the only applications provided are the politically-correct ones that one could presume without even opening the text.  It's a good book, but not the masterpiece that many seem to be seeing here.
B000001FP8|5.0|This album is perhaps one of Bon Jovi's best albums to date. With the many memorable tunes including \\"Blood on Blood,\\" to their wonderful but sad \\"Living in Sin,\\" and their awesome mono track, \\"Ride Cowboy Ride,\\" Bon Jovi knows how to rock and have fun at the same time. This album is just a memorable album all-in-one and the entire band is just incredible. They are ALL GODS of everything they do in the band altogether. Richie on Electric Guitar, Jon on Vocals, Tico on Drums, and David on keyboards. They are just incredible and shows that they love what they do and enjoy it for the love of their fans. And although Alec, the bassist, left after the release of Crossroad, Bon Jovi remained strong and continued their bond as a group for a very long time. This is definitely a must have album for any classic rock 80's or Bon Jovi fan. I will continue to treasure this album for the longest time now and forever.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|I read the book in 1997 and was thrilled when I found out that Anthony Minghella would make the film. I thought he did a great job on \\"The English Patient.\\" However, in that movie, he chose to go with Kirsten Scott Thomas to play the British aristocrat instead of using Demi Moore (!) as the studio wanted. Well, he should have done a similar thing for Cold Mountain which is an excellent book. Nicole Kidman is not convincing as the daughter of a North Carolina chaplain. She always has every hair in place and her forehead is botoxed up the kazoo. She looks older than Inman and even seems to overpower him at times. Natalie Portman, who plays a small role in the movie, would have been better as the lead. Don't even get me started on Renee Zellweger's granny imitation. How she won an Academy Award for that cariacature performance is beyond me. And then there is the scenery -- that was definitely NOT North Carolina! And then there is the grisly rewriting of the book which makes the Southern guys in the Home Guard look like the real bad guys. This movie was a mess and the audience I saw it with went home very deflated.
0385335482|5.0|This is THE book that got my Chick Lit obesession started. I purchased this book a few years ago on a whim and it was all down hill from there.  <br /> <br />In this first book of the Shopaholic Series readers meet Becky Bloomwood, shopaholic. Kinsella takes us along as Becky pleads with the bank for a larger credit limit, shops her tail off, and puts off bills, thinking if she hides the statements they will go away.  <br /> <br />With hysterical letters to the bank, from the bank and more, after almost every chapter Becky Bloomwood will have you cracking up from beginning to end!  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this series to women readers of all ages. But read them in order!!  <br /> <br />
0393312836|5.0|Despite the nadsat language, I felt this novel flowed from beginning to end.  This tale of violence, tragedy, and atonement is a true right of passage novel.  Told through the eyes of a teenanger it is both humerous and gut-wrentchingly honest.  Very similar to catcher in the rye, you find the central character  endearing, despite his violent tendencies.  It is refreshing to read true literature again after some of the modern day garbage I have been exposed to recently.  I'll read this again and again.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B0007O38F8|1.0|His reign of annoyance is at an end.  Check out the song titles. They are even dumber then the last ones.  Piggy Bank, Candy Shop, Gatman and Robin, Ski Mask Way, My Toy Soldier and lets not forget the misspellings.  He found a way to make nursery rhymes badazz, SO original.  2 Quarter gives more then just rap a bad name; he is a joke and an insult to music in general.  Still living off his image of being shot 9 times (shot 9 times cause he sucks) he tries to resurrect himself by declaring a \\"Gangsta\\" war on another rapper named \\"the Game\\".  In my opinion, \\"The Game\\" is a stupid name, but from what I have heard, his new record is far better.  So thumbs up for him as he clearly won this \\"Gangsta\\" war.  All 2 quarter is trying to do is avoid doing insurance commercials with M.C. Hammer.  But his time is coming, his career is falling and his money will continue to rise until *poof*, it's all gone.  Well, 50, Hope your future career as the replacement for the Geico Gecko goes well for you.  Hell be sayin' \\"I just saved a bunch of dolla bill$ yo, by joinin' the geico gang!\\" or something similar, assuming he can read the cue cards.       P.S. If you liked this, then check out my review for get Rich or Die trying which is the first part to this vent/rant of rage.
0679731725|3.0|This is one of those books that doesn't blow you away with a sensational story, shocking plot twists, or edge of your seat suspense. It's not that kind of book. I almost wish it was an assigned book for a class or for my book club so I'd have someone to talk about it with because I think it would prove to be much more rewarding that way. Unfortunately, I don't have that luxury, so I am forced to just take away from it what I can, which is that this book is rich in character, but somehow lacking in something that I can't quite put my finger on. It reads like an old classic, or something akin to Gosford Park in terms of modern adaptations of the comedy of manners theme. I would recommend it, though, but only guardedly, with friends who are interested in Victorian novels (because that's how it feels).
B000069HK2|5.0|wow, this cd is just, amazing. why i've never gotten around to writing a review on it, i don't know. it's an emotional rollercoaster through pretty much every emotion. i mean to have a song as sad, depressing, and beautiful as 'Poetic Tragedy' and then to have a song as angry as 'A Box Full of Sharp Objects' that just shows versatility. it's so everywhere it's amazing. and it's just so raw and kind of lost sounding, not bad lost, but new to this lost. i would definitely say that 'Maybe Memories', 'The Taste of Ink', 'Poetic Tragedy', 'A Box Full of Sharp Objects', and 'On My own' are the stand out tracks. this is definitely an amazing cd, if you don't have it then get up off your ass and buy it.
B000002U82|5.0|I'm pretty new to Dark Side, having purchased the CD in March, 2004.  Pink Floyd is now one of my very favorite bands, and if I had to keep only one CD this would be the one!  Despite the continual references to death and dying throughout the album, I don't find it depressing at all!  No one over forty years old can fail to relate to the feeling of having 'missed the starting gun' in their lives!  Wow!  I also have found that my mood will not change after listening.  There is no bad time to hear this.  Comparatively speeking, I would say that Dark Side is truly 'music', while everything else is just 'songs'.  For the cool effects, exceptionally heartfelt lyrics and superior musicianship I would rate this as THE all time greatest album!
B000683VI4|5.0|The movie begins with a man reading from a faded notebook to a woman in a nursing home. The story he tells follows the lives of two North Carolina teens from very different worlds, Noah the son of a poor farmer, and Allie the daughter of a rich family from the northeast who summer in Noah's hometown. Despite their economic differences, after much persistence on the part of Noah, Noah and Allie spend one summer together before they are separated, first by her parents, who were disgusted that she fell for a man like Noah, and then by WWII.  <br /> <br />After the soldiers come home, everything is different. Despite the letters Noah wrote Allie everyday when he was away, Allie is engaged, to a man more in sync with her parents wishes, and Noah lives alone with his memories in a 200-year-old house he lovingly restores. (The house he promiesed to buy for Allie and fix up that summer) But when Allie sees an article in a local paper about Noah's handiwork, she knows that she's got to find him and make a decision once and for all about the path her life and her love must take....  <br /> <br />And so they meet again... and the truth about Allie's family comes out... Allie, all these years, has believe that Noah forgot about her, having not recieved any of the letters he sent. Come to find out Allie's mother took all the letters from the mail and hid them away before Allie saw them (we later learn this is because Allie's mother had a similar relationship with a poor man when she was younger).... but now things are complicated... Allie is engaged to a man who loves her so much, and whom her parents aprove of...  <br /> <br />Noah has loved Allie for all the years they were seperated. He could have been with other women but he never had the desire to, Allie owned his heart... Now that she is back in his life he does not want to let her go...  <br /> <br />What will Allie do?  <br /> <br />This story is amazing. The power of the love is felt through the incredible cast of actors. The emotions are so powerful and the characters so full of life. I am usually not such a sap for romantic movies but this one was different. I cried and cried... in the theatre! So ladies wear that waterproof mascara for this one.  <br />
B00000DQSV|3.0|Having gotten their side projects out of their systems, the five members of Duran Duran went through a rather violent metamorphosis. Simon, Nick and Andy were in, Andy Taylor dropped by, but was essentially out, and Roger Taylor walked away. The remaining trio soldiered on, and realized a career irony by bringing formative influence Nile Rogers of Chic on board as producer.<br /><br />Losing Andy and Roger obviously sapped some of their spark, because \\"Notorious\\" sounds smoother and silkier than any previous DD album, There is also the surprising funk of the title track, the album's biggest hit. But instead of the high energy teen-pop of the first three albums, the album concentrates on invigorated art music. It made for some interesting songs (\\"American Science\\" and \\"Meet El Presidente\\") and the fantastic \\"Skin Trade.\\" Unfortunately, the world was not ready for the mature Duran Duran, so all the neat horn charts and slick soul backing vocals couldn't lure in old Durannies, who likely had begun to grow into non-pinup music.<br /><br />Which is too bad. \\"Notorious\\" may have been uneven, but it was by no means a disaster (like \\"Pop Trash\\" or \\"Liberty\\"). It was just a little odd that, after claiming for so many years that they aspired to make music that combined Chic and the Sex Pistols, the album they created with Nile Rogers had more hints of Roxy Music the \\"Le Freak.\\" This album really needed more of the Power Station and less of Arcadia, but you can be forgiven if you get guilty pleasure from the titular track, the funky \\"Proportion\\" and the atmospheric \\"Winter Marches On.\\"
B000084T18|1.0|No Wonder 2 Quarter has been shot nine times.  He sucks.  Period.  He can (c)rap all he wants about being in the club and money.  Its all hype, soon he'll be just as relevant as M.C. Hammer and doing commercials for insurance.  His plans are clearly obvious, look at the title!  Get Rich or Die Tryin', thus meaning, trying all the easy shots at getting fame and money.  Act tough, look tough, become the biggest hype, rap idiotically cause its something that they'll play at the clubs or raves because everybody will like it cause they are tripped out on PCP or something, and then they'll start using 50 Cent as a code word for drugs, because in time that's all anybody will remember him or at least the slogan for.  No body will care about the \\"music\\", only about this cool little code word that will pop up in time.  I may be wrong, but don't be surprised if it comes true.....or maybe its already in affect right now.... *gasps* <br /> <br />You got to hand it to 2 Quarter, his wildest dreams came true.  He got rich at the expense of the masses.  His reign of annoyance is almost at its end as apparently, his new CD flat out sucks even more.  Well, now its time of his career to die.  Don't be surprised if he puts out a CD titled \\"Stay Rich or Die Tryin'\\", when he runs out of ideas to avoid doing commercials with M.C. Hammer by his side.   <br /> <br />P.S. Check out my review for the massacre as well.  If you liked this, then you'll enjoy that too.

B0007GAERG|5.0|This is by far the comeback of ALL musical comebacks. There is no question the Mariah Carey still has the voice to sing just about anything. And anyone that dare doubt it should go out and buy this record. I seriously doubt that anyone complaining has even listened to the album, because half of the one stars aren't even commenting on it. Fact is, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is surreal. It doesn't seem like Mariah ever took a day off. Her vocals are fantastic. This is a classic. Recording artists just don't comeback on a whim with great songs and great singing. This is an event. Mimi has been fully emancipated.  <br /> <br />Album Highlights: <br /> <br />We Belong Together <br />Mine Again <br />Stay The Night <br />One And Only <br />I Wish You Knew <br />Joy Ride <br />Fly Like A Bird <br />

B0006A9FMI|3.0|Unless you are fluent in Japaneese you will spend more time reading the dialogue than whatching the stunning visuals of the film. The film has a rich engaging storyline too bad it seems more like reading a book than watching a movie. The publishing of this movie by a major label that is so poor quality is inexcusable. Especially when dubbing is readily available...

1402543689|5.0|I think that greatly enhanced my appreciation of the book -- I had read two more in the series (including the first) but liked this the best, perhaps in part because the accents were so well done.  The reader really brought the book to life, almost like listening to a play, since so much consists of dialogue or inner thoughts. <br /> <br />The books in this series all consist of a series of stories wound together by the lives of the main characters (a female detective, her assistant, her fiance, and her foster children), who live in Botswana.  This book revealed the author's continuing interest in ethics.  There are a number of story lines going on in the book, but the title comes from an assignment in trying to determine which finalist in a beauty contest is also a highly moral person -- only there are only three days to find the answer.  The solution is rather amusing.  Other plot lines include a child found in the wilderness -- who is he?  and a woman who may be trying to kill her husband -- or so her brother-in-law fears.  The two lady detectives have their work cut out for them trying to solve their problems and run the auto repair -- since the manager is suffering from an illness that prevents him from doing this, and it's up to them to keep the feckless apprentices working. <br /> <br />I am developing a love for the country through these books and their portrayal of life there with people who are kind and joyful -- who continually find reason to be happy despite their problems. <br /> <br />
0385336810|5.0|Sophie Kinsella does it again. If you love the Shopaholic Series you will love Can You Keep a Secret.  <br /> <br />Kinsella introduces a new character, Emma, to us in this great book. Emma, while on a plane which seems to be on its way down feels the need to spill all her long lost secrets to the man sitting next to her, before she dies. Needless to say the plane doesn't crash and Emma is embarassed but finds solace in the fact that she will never see that man again.... or will she...  <br /> <br />Back to reality Emma at work one day happens upon that very man in the office... and he happens to be her new BOSS!  <br /> <br />This book is so fun. Kinsella has a way of penning such loveable characters, and Emma is no exception.  <br />

B000001EXR|1.0|No wonder it was unreleased for a while and recenly out of print (about to be re-issued). This is Kiss trying to be someone else. Both Gene and Paul made fun of the seattle sound back in the day and this is them trying to copy that style.  <br /> <br />Kiss has always been known as a party/good time band. Well, on this record they're pretending to be angry the whole album. It sounds fake. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and save your money. You won't regret it.

0446677450|4.0|Though many of the points the author mentions are important enough to bear repeating, this short book could've easily still been cut in half if redundancy was kept to a minimum.  He says the same things so often throughout the book I felt like he was treating me like a retard that needed to be reminded of something 50 times within the SAME chapter.  Still, it is a very informative book on the psychology of money and the relationship people have with money.  It's great for changing your attitude towards money and financial goals, which is the first step towards wealth. However, it doesn't go into how to learn about investment basics, etc.  You'll have to go elsewhere for that.  I just have a thing against supreme redundancy and repitition, since that kind of thing drives me crazy- but It is after all very informative and I would definitely recommend it.    P.S.-After reading the book if you log on to the rich dad poor dad website, the author has a free mini audio book which you can download.  I really like these mini audio programs and especially enjoyed the one which complemented the next book \\"Cashflow Quadrant.\\"    P.S.S- Alot of the reviews and such on this book are fake.  I know people who were PAID to put up good reviews for this book.  Just fyi.  It is a very redundant book.
6305229449|5.0|There's something about this movie that gives you sort of a \\"Girls can do anything!\\" kind of feeling...well, unless you're a boy; but you understand what I'm saying.  The animation is very colorful, which is a very desirable quality in any cartoon, movie or T.V. show.  The characters were very likable, and I didn't find myself rolling my eyes or nearly gagging at any of them.  That's another good quality in a movie: likable characters.  Trust me, I've read plenty of books where I think the author got the main character mixed up with the main character's enemy who everyone is supposed to hate.  But back on the subject of \\"Mulan\\", it was a funny, well-thought-out movie that you will want to watch over and over again.  And did I mention that it has REALLY catchy songs?

0805066691|4.0|It's been over 3 decades since Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee was first written and it remains an authority on the history of the Native Americans in the American West.        Written from the native americans point of view, Dee Brown, an incredible historian, documents the conflicts and issues that eventually led to the settlement, forced settlement that is, of indians on reservations between 1860 and 1890. While describing these issues, Brown does not fall into the pattern of historians of exalting the white man while portraying the native Americans as savages. While sympathetic to the Natives, punches are not pulled about actions of either side. The history is much more complicated than a string of broken promises and broken treaties. The stories of different tribes as the Navajo, Apache, Ute, Cheyenne/Sioux, Kiowa/Puna have similar conflicts that these nations had with whites. Yet the side stories of the inter-tribal conflicts within nations and the different circumstances between the federal government and Indians are what make this book good, which are definitely explained with detail. The only bad things I have to say about the book are the lack of maps to explain the areas written about and the continuous, unchanging style of the book. It is a history book of course and therefore lacks the spunk of fiction novels.    Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is an outstanding history explains many misconceptions caucasians have about the settlement of the west. I recommend it for anyone interested in the real history of the U.S.A., how the real American west was won, from the point of view of the people who lived it. All in all, I give this book a 4 out of 5 stars  Brian
630460288X|3.0|Sylvester Stallone is rogue cop John Spartan, a law enforcement officer from the 90's who is \\"thawed out\\" in the year 2032 to track down his arch-nemesis Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes). One-liners and bullets fly at break-neck pace as Stallone and Snipes punch, kick, and shoot their way into a \\"violence-free\\" future. Sandra Bullock also shows up as Sly's new partner but her perfomance is easily overshadowed by the hilarious Denis Leary who pops up in the film's third act. There hasn't been an action movie this enjoyably cheesy since Tango & Cash. The DVD edition offers a commentary track and a trailer.
0788805843|4.0|First, let me start off by saying that I am quite aware that this movie very much alters the original story of \\"Hercules\\".  But I have learned over time that Disney does that with movies.  They sugar-coat the story until it is simple and appropriate enough for children to enjoy.  They did it with \\"Pocahontas\\", \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\", and probably some other movies that I don't know of.  In the true story of Pocahontas, Pocahontas was just a young teen when she met the older John Smith, and the original \\"Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" ended up being one of the most disgusting, disturbing books I've ever read in my life...okay, now that I've said that, on to my review! <br /> <br />\\"Hercules\\" is a really good movie!  It has comedy, romance, great animation, a good plot, and great songs.  \\"Hercules\\" used to be one of my favorite movies, even though Hades, God of the Underworld, scared me (I was three or four).  I loved the romantic parts with Megara and Hercules, and I thought the part where Zeus makes Pegasus was cute, and...if you like Disney cartoon movies, then I suggest just seeing it for yourself!  And don't be surprised if some of the songs get stuck in your head!

0064400018|5.0|I like this book because you get to learn about history and how people got to work and school.  I gave it five stars because it is my favorite book in the world.  When Laura and Mary got something when Baby Carrie was not there they ate half of it and saved the rest for baby Carrie.
B00004XONN|5.0|If you're thinking \\"I heard Radiohead fell off the wagon after OK Computer...I'm not sure I should buy this\\" then listen to what I have to say, PLEASE.  When i first bought \\"Kid A\\" and listened to it, I thought it was awful, it just seemed like it was being \\"weird\\" and \\"out there\\" for the sake of being \\"weird\\" and \\"out there.\\"  But after a few listens the album seriously grew on me.  REALLY.  I couldn't stop listening.  My point is, give \\"Kid A\\" a chance, it's an incredible musical achievement with more to discover on every listen.  (the best time to listen: driving in a car at night) <br />this album deserves 5 stars <br />if you think you can appriciate good music, not just anything you hear on the pop radio stations, go out and BUY KID A NOW!!!
B00005JKMQ|3.0|Well, I guess this movie was okay. Definitely not among one of my favorite movies featuring Will Smith, but worth checking out just to learn about the life of the legendary boxer.

0812550757|4.0|I wanted more of a story of Ender as a child genius, that was the only disappointment to this book. This book was a little harder to read as it dealt with much bigger and thought provoking ideas. It is obvious that a lot of thought and planning went into the telling of this story. I truly enjoyed reading this book and look forward to revisiting it again in a few years.
B00020HEG6|5.0|In an earlier review of Horner's score for the movie \\"Troy,\\" I criticized the composer for heavily \\"borrowing\\" from his other works.  I failed to acknowledge that composers have singular orchestrations that separate their compositions from others in the field.<br /><br />A trained ear could recognize, without reading the credits, the music of Bernard Herrmann, Jerry Goldsmith, Miklos Rozsa, or Alfred Newman because each, respectively, possessed a sound that was unlike the other.<br /><br />And John Williams is no different.<br /><br />Even though there are strains reminiscent of themes used in the \\"Star Wars\\" series, \\"The Witches of Eastwick,\\" \\"Hook,\\" \\"Jane Eyre,\\" \\"Superman - The Movie,\\" as well as countless other William's works, there is enough that is \\"new\\" to make \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\" one of the composer's best.<br /><br />\\"Aunt Marge's Waltz\\" is beautifully executed with a touch of whimsy while \\"The Knight Bus\\" is justly frenetic as is the on-screen drive through the streets of London.  \\"Apparition on the Train\\" is as ominous as it should be.  With its percussion intro, \\"Buckbeak's Flight\\" takes wing majestically.  Beginning with a celeste solo \\"A Window to the Past\\" is reflective and lilting.<br /><br />\\"The Patronus Light\\" awes, a la \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" and \\"The Dementors Converge\\" is possibly one of Williams' most haunting compositions.<br /><br />And to top it off, the \\"Mischief Managed\\" compiles all the major themes into a twelve-minute example of why Williams is a multiple Oscar winner.<br /><br />Alas, the Academy didn't recognize him in this year's awards with the little golden guy.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I want to start this off sayin that 50's Get Rich or Die Tryin' was a classic CD for Eastcoast hip-hop. It boosted New York in the hip-hop game as well as gangsta rap. 50 became King of New York and sold 11 million worldwide. That's amazing. But it seems all the fame and money has gottin to 50's head. In The Massacre you can tell he has gottin lazy by just recording any song for the hell of it. I guess because he knows that anything he sings will get platium.The Massacre iz not gangsta or hardcore as Get Rich. In his first album he talked bout' gettin shot and growin up alone in queens. People loved that. But in this album he talks about it all over again. It like listen to 21 Questions 21 times, and listen to In Da Club over again. I'm not a hater. 50 has talent out his ass. It just seems like that talent only comes out in hardcore rap songs like Many Men and patiently waiting. Also his mixtapes shows he is nuttin to f*ck wit! But The Massacre has no street song except for In my Hood which is hot. But If u a fan of gangsta rap like Biggie 2pac DMX this album is defintely not for u. Save this one for the girls.
B000021XS0|5.0|i love most of this album is awesome lots of shredding and stuf but throuher her eyues is so lame with that boring r&b singer r&b is not real music like prog take that off and this ablum is perfect but not as good as traing of thought. <br /> <br />oh and anthoy thomas shut up u r not troo prog king crimson is boring and old dream theater are real yo u probably like tool too.
0812550706|5.0|I thought this was really one of the better books I've read in the last couple years. The development of the main characters was very well done. The overall story line idea was really enjoyable. While things might have been a little predictable, still is was difficult to put the book down, because of the desire to see what was going to happen.
B0007QJ1MK|2.0|a couple of the songs are good, but most are so repetitive that the album on the whole is just boring.  these guys need to take a Learning Annex class on writing a bridge or something.
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors Debut album is one to remember. Everything about is perfect. It's hard to believe one cd can be filled with all amazing songs. <br />Light my fire - a true classic, that can never be touched <br />End - an unforgettable song, dark, and mysterious... its so wonderful! <br />Twentieth Century Fox - a feel good song <br />Soul Kitchen - another great song, one that gets stuck in your head <br />The Crystal Ship - a pretty, and relaxing song <br />Back Door man - a raw song, awesome <br />Break on through - another special song <br /> <br />They're all Great! A cd couldn't get any better!

0312954468|4.0|Even as a fan of non-fiction history, I quickly came to ignore this book's flawed history because the story is so good.  Wilbur Smith creates characters (however implausible) that you really come to feel like you know and puts them into situations (again frequently implausible) where you find yourself really routing for them. <br /> <br />It is a testament to the quality of the storytelling in this book that you are willing as the reader to overlook implausibilities and historical innaccuracies because you're enjoying the story so much. <br /> <br />A really enjoyable, well-told story.  Highly recommended for fans of fiction and historical fiction.
B000001EAQ|4.0|I remember at first, I really wasn't into this CD.  The first 7 songs were great, but thought the rest of the songs were pretty disposable.  Then 8 years later, I start playing this CD again.  I'm not sure if it's because ...Atomic Bomb is that bad, but Pop is really starting to grow on me.   <br /> <br />Though at times the experimentation may fail, at least they had some type of spark with this CD.  Though the least of my favorite 3 CD's from the 90's era, it holds its own quite well.   <br /> <br />
B00005O5UG|5.0|Debut albums are often the stuff of great discussion and controversy. In the case of \\"This Was\\", Jethro Tull appeared on the music scene largely unheralded. Perhaps part of the reason was the many of the songs were strongly blues influenced and appeared at a time when blues were making a musical comeback, thus becoming somewhat lost in the flood of other music. It's also possible that the broad variation of musical styles, a characteristic of Tull throughout their history, made the album difficult to classify, and rather than deal with a group that fit no single category, reviews were lukewarm. Current reviews hail \\"This Was\\" for its creativity and for the eclectic collection of music that defied 1968 conventions.<br /><br />This album remains unusual, even considering all the albums that have been released since 1968. There are strong blues songs, Ian's rock/jazz/blues style of playing a flute, and flavors of rock and folk; clearly not a concept album, but a group of guys getting together and throwing what they had, which was very good, onto an album.<br /><br />The album kicks off with \\"My Sunday Feeling\\", a lament about the aftereffects of Saturday night. The flute in this song modifies the blues-rock guitar riffs and drums to provide a jazz twist. Ian's vocals could similarly be either blues or jazz. Regardless of how you classify the song, it's heartfelt and creative.<br /><br />\\"Some Day the Sun Won't Shine for You\\" is all blues, with an acoustic guitar and harmonica flavoring the song from the outset. The vocals have a classic blues sound to them that fit well with the acoustic instruments; a mellow breakup song advising the ex-girlfriend that some day she'll have a bad day.<br /><br />\\"Beggar's Farm\\" begins with a repetitive series of blues-flavored rock notes. During the bridge the electric guitar and flute increase the blues flavor substantially. The theme here is a significant other with an outside relationship. The song advises her that she's going down in a bad way, and one day she'll end up on the beggar's farm, where perhaps he will see her (if she asks him nicely). It seems that Ian Anderson and Mick Abrahams were feeling down while writing these songs, as the next song, \\"Move on Alone\\", seems to indicate. Here the girlfriend has gone, and he's trying to overcome his grief to get on with his life. The blues instrumentation in this song is jazz-flavored with brass.<br /><br />The next two songs are instrumentals. The first, \\"Serenade for Cuckoo\\", sounds like a piece for a jazz combo, with Ian's flute providing a substitute for a horn. The lead guitar is playing blues, with mellow riffs. A very laidback piece. \\"Dharma for One\\" follows with a faster beat. While blues flavor this song as well, it is rock at heart. You can even hear elements of progressive rock in this song, including a portion that sounded to me a little like some of King Crimson's later style. The only strange thing about this instrumental is a drum solo that may have been a bit of 1968 experimentation on Jethro Tull's part.<br /><br />The next song is \\"It's Breaking Me Up\\", where the group moves into solid blues. This song joins the second track as the two most solidly blues songs on this CD. Ian plays the harmonica like a veteran blues man, and you might think you were in a New Orleans blues bar instead of listening to Jethro Tull.<br /><br />We jump from a classic blues song to a nearly psychedelic instrumental, \\"Cat's Squirrel\\". Each time I hear this piece I am reminded of early Black Sabbath. For much of the song the lead guitar and bass guitar pound out hard rock sounding riffs, and when the drums take off you could easily think you are listening to an early Black Sabbath recording; the heaviest cut on this CD.<br /><br />\\"A Song for Jeffrey\\" is the last song on the CD before the short instrumental \\"Round\\" (excluding the three relatively unnecessary \\"extra\\" tracks). Ian Anderson sings this song with a blues-like guttural vocal, yet the instrumentation backing Ian is rock, perhaps you could even consider this hard rock. \\"Round\\" finishes off the CD with a jazz sound, combining piano, drums and flute. The piece is short and to the point.<br /><br />I am not going to provide any discussion of the three extra tracks. Usually extra tracks add to an album. In this case, the three extras are unnecessary distractions, given that I have a lot of Tull CDs.  Further, the mixture of eras is inappropriate.<br /><br />There is a quote on the liner for this CD that states \\"'This Was' how we were playing then - but things change.\\" Little did anyone realize how true that quote was when Jethro Tull was soon to release \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Thick as a Brick\\", among others. More importantly, Jethro Tull was already experimenting with musical elements that would eventually be termed progressive, though this CD is more blues and jazz-flavored rock than progressive. Jethro Tull helped show the rest of the rock world that if you were brave, you could stretch the limits of what could fit onto a single album pretty far. This debut album helped define that this group had no definition, and has never needed one, because they have always defined themselves.l, yet the instrumentation backing Ian is rock, perhaps you could even consider this hard rock. \\"Round\\" finishes off the CD with a jazz sound, combining piano, drums and flute.

B0000024RZ|4.0|This CD is so pure. Every song has such amazing lyrics and meaning to it. Next to Dylans Greatests Hits, this has got to be the best Bob Dylan CD.
B0007GAERG|5.0|It feels as if it's back during Musicbox and Daydream..........with a twist of Butterfly in it.  What an album!  It's fresh, it's energetic, and it's full of love and emotion.  This one makes Charmbracelet sound bland  :)
B0006399FS|2.0|As hard as I try to get into this CD, somehow it's just not happening for me.  With the exception of a few songs (Vertigo, Crumbs on Your Table, and Miracle Drug), this sounds like some outtakes from All That You Can Left Behind.   <br /> <br />I have almost all U2 CD's and really enjoy the 80's and 90's material.  But this CD just falls short. <br /> <br />Starters to U2 would be better off getting Achtung Baby, The Joshua Tree, or War.
B000002UVX|5.0|This is the best glimpse I can think of for what Jimi Hendrix might've evolved into, at least during the early 70s. Like Jeff Beck, the only rock guitarist of that era to share Jimi's stubborn refusal to be pigeon-holed, Hendrix's future was likely to be an on-going quest to find new musical inspiration. The soul, funk, and rock medley of genres in this live collection of the best of the short-lived Band of Gypsys Fillmore East concerts is a passionate and exciting peek into what would've been a fruitful next stage in his career.  For a man whose time in the spotlight was extraordinarily short, the excessive amounts of recorded materials on the market make it difficult to distinguish between the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Sadly there is far too much of the latter and far too little of the former. Without Jimi around to scrap the crap, record execs pushed for everything and anything to be dumped on the public, especially as is the case with his most zealous fans, a voracious lot who devour it all and still beg for more.<br /><br />Hendrix, in my opinion, made up in guitar work what he lacked in songwriting, leaving us with a plethora of dated, trippy, groovy, and plain annoying hippie fodder which clouds any point his lyrics were attempting to convey. Although his guitar brilliance may have been enough to overlook the silliness of the lyrical content, it also lent itself to a meandering nature that overtakes some of the material, especially the unauthorized stuff, and much of the live recordings.<br /><br />I'm glad that this cd offers little of those short-comings. While \\"Power to Love\\" has some of the aforementioned lyrics, the chorus is good and the riff and rhythym of the song are strong enough to allow you to forget the b.s. about jellyfish having no backbone.<br /><br />Another strong component of this offering is the vocal duties of Buddy Miles, who relieves Jimi of some of the front-man responsibilities and allows him to indulge us with his guitar work.  Buddy's well done \\"Changes\\" is a highlight of the recording and his scat work in the opening \\"Who Knows\\" is jazzy and fresh. \\"Machine Gun\\" and \\"Message of Love\\" are more well-known songs and are given excellent work-outs here.  This is, to my knowledge, the only live recordings of Hendrix that the man himself had a hand in and his choices are sound and don't include sloppy rambling guitar fireworks as do many of the releases elsewhere, even those put out by Experience Hendrix. The songs are long-ish jams, but are still tight enough and focused enough to keep the listener attentive.  Extended live songs are a risky business, but as is the case with the Allman Brothers Live at the Fillmore East record, when done well they are remarkable. This is Hendrix live as it should be, and is the best live materials I've heard of Jimi. The box set, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, has some excellent material as well, particularly those culled from the old \\"In The West\\" album, but even that has far too much that doesn't cut it.  Band of Gypsys is an excellent piece of work from a man who left far too much potential on the table with his tragic early passing.  While the saddest thing about listening to this record is thinking what might have been, it is still a rare chance to listen to a preview of where this transcendent guitarist was going.done \\"Changes\\" is a highlight of the recording and his scat work in the opening \\"Who Knows\\" is jazzy and fresh. \\"Machine Gun\\" and \\"Message of Love\\" are more well-known songs and are given excellent work-outs here.

B00007KMOX|3.0|While the 5:1 SACD sound is better than any CD, it is only incrementally better.  After noticing the lack of \\"breath\\" and \\"space\\" in the sound, a staleness in the strings. I checked the liner notes, and sure enough, the sound passed through a 96KHz, 24 bit pulse code modulation (PCM) bottleneck during remastering.  I buy SACDs for one reason: to get DSD sound, and frankly, I feel ripped off again.  Numerous other SACD/DSD discs are 96/24PCM, and sound like hell --- the Lindsay Beethoven op. 130, Hillary Hahn's SACDs, Alison Krauss, Mozart with Manze.  Philips and Sony had better change their licensing of the DSD/SACD mark to stop the brand dilution by PCM mastering.  You want to hear real DSD sound?  Get Mozart's Requiem with Harnoncourt, or Mozart with Midori.  Once you've heard real DSD, you can spot 96/24 PCM every time. I won't buy SACDs anymore unless I can verify they are PCM-free.
0553275976|3.0|One of the most important novels of the 1980s Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" gives us a very realistic portrayal of New York during that period.  <br /> <br />  But realism, tinged by Wolfe's own outrageous characters, and his relentless satire. While there may be nice things to say about both, Wolfe needs to realize that sometimes, saying little is the best way forward. <br /> <br />  And yet,Wolfe fails to make a statement with the book. The reason he is not ranked with Swift as satirist is specially because of this. Swift had a vision, a way he wanted the world to be, and besides, he was far more imaginative than Wolfe could ever hope to be. Wolfe's satire is limited by his reportial aspirations; Swift went so much further and took his to an artistic, and almost prophetic level.  <br /> <br /> And finally, Wolfe isn't even the best satirist in America. John Updike offers far more power in the last of his \\"Rabbit\\" novels, and does so as he provides other things. <br /> <br /> But as a novel, the book falls flat. The badly overdone characters work well when used for satire alone, but are too shallow and clunky to sustain a story as long as this one. Characters so one dimensional that they serve as excellent entertainment, but not if we are to gain any real pleasure out of the book. And the constant emphasis given things, as he did in his second novel, makes teh novel that much less appealing. Thomas Pynchon resorts to outrageous characterization too, but notice how skilfully that is done, how that feels like the magnification of a real person's feelings. Tom Wolfe, the other Thomas, can't do that, or will not do that.  <br /> <br /> The best part of the book was the end, the only part that felt inspired and original. When everything is taken away from him and how he reacts, that was the only part of the book in which Sherman McCoy shows a side of him that's different from what he did before. You wish the whole book had been this taut and unpredictable.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Yes, finally the comeback we've all waited for!! WE MISSED YOU MARIAH!! Do NOT miss this album, it is wonderful!!
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album for me is vintage Mariah Carey with a modern flair. Vintage because we get her classic, ear-pleasing vocals. But modern enough to succeed in this decade or any other. And this is one of Carey's proven strengths over the years. She's able to make songs that are relevant, that people can relate to, but aren't too heady that you can't enjoy them. Mariah has a carefree and graceful style to every song. She makes her lyrics poignant, but keeps the entertainment value high. Mariah knows what works and what her fans really want to hear. The \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" marks the triumphant return of one of the greatest singers ever. With this CD, Mariah puts herself on course for legendary status. Her fans would never doubt it for a second, and for them she's already there. Hopefully, the doubters and skeptics will now realize the scale and size of the musical contribution that she has actually made. Mariah Carey is a modern legend with an epic voice and immeasurable talent. She has exceeded all expectations.
B00005JKNF|3.0|Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, Kristen Scott Thompson, Michael Gambon,Emily Watson, man, just an A list of British superstars headline this movie about interactions between the rich and the servants that live in the belowstairs.

Its got alot of meaning and depth to it. its about life and why we live and things of that sort. a very well made and worth while album....
B00005AQE8|3.0|I've gotta say I'm a real Tupac fan- Strictly 4 My Niggaz, Tupacalypse Now and Me Against The World were all superb albums that had great beats and bass lines accompanied by some of the man's best lyrical work. <br /> <br />This, on the other hand (his first album after joining Death Row Records) seems to be more like that tosh getting released these days by Fiddee and Ja Rule. He spends too long slating his fellow rappers- Biggie and Dre most notably- when perhaps he should have been having a good look at some of the production here. <br /> <br />Two cds never seems to be the best idea on a rap album, and I'm thinking of Wu-Tang Forver here as well (which wasn't exactly ground-breaking either), but this album simply has a general mediocre feeling to it. There's too many tracks like Whatz Ya Phone #, Shorty Wanna Be a Thug etc, and while you get the occasional classic like Picture Me Rollin', there's simply not enough quality here. Even that Tupac classic California Love is a dodgy remix (encouraging you to buy the single no doubt!!), and all in all this is a rather tame affair which did, and still does nothing to add to the rap genre in the slightest. <br /> <br />If you want to listen to a good Tupac album I suggest investing your money elsewhere, in his older stuff, and leaving this on the shelf.
B000244EMO|4.0|i tohught this movie had a pretty good story, good suspence and great action. one of my fav parts is where they completely annihalate the forest. the predator himself was keeped pretty well hidden through out the movie and that sort of created a Jaws feel o the film. over all a well made/planned movie......
B00005JNTV|5.0|Sin City is absolutely phenomenal. The acting is great and very reminiscient of older films, and the film has a dark, edgy, highly stylistic look to it (thanks undoubtedly to the comics, of course). Black and white with instances of color works really well for the film. I love the fact that two of Sin City's chapters (the first and the third one) have enough emotional depth to match their film noir feel. And the second chapter is just a balls-out action flick, and a sort of a nice respite from the other stories. For some it might seem out of place, but it worked great for me.     I can't say enough great things about Sin City. It's just that good.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Most of this movie is good.  Some parts are extraordinary.  The most provacative image in the film that I recall is when Gigolo Joe watches the boy fall into the water.  The reflection of the boy on the glass looks like a tear running down Joe's face, which resonated with the film's theme of expressing vs. experiencing emotion quite well.  This film has a lot of things going for it... until the ending.  Speilberg just HAD to ruin his own film by making a long, drawn-out, documentary-style ending.  He should have ended it when the boy fell in the water.  That would have been an interesting, thought-provoking ending.  I like to pretend that the movie ended there.  The pointless and silly stuff that ensues afterward is simply painful and disappointing.  <br /> <br />As it stands, however, this is one of the most believable and serious science fiction films I have seen in years (I hated Minority Report). Few science fiction films this good exist.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Its easy to try and slam Ms. Carey but the long and short of it is this--The Emancipation of Mimi is a fine R&B CD.  Mariah's voice is as strong as ever, the production is clean (no intros or interludes clogging up the flow of the songs with filler), and the balance between dance tracks and ballads is perfect.  Oh yeah, and the songs are really good too. 'Say Sumpthin' is among the Neptunes' best work and Mariah nails it.  'Stay the Night' is just as good, and 'Fly Like a Bird' is sublime. 'We Belong Together' is a straightforward and beautiful love song. There are no chinks in Ms. Carey's armor here. Some critics may pan the CD because Mariah won't \\"open up\\" and pander for their sympathy.  Screw the critics--most of them are fat guys who can't dance. Really, if they knew so much about music, they'd  be artists themselves, now wouldn't they?  Mariah is good at what she does, singing heartfelt music that makes you feel good. Say what you will, Mariah is firmly on the right side of the line separating R&B royalty (along with Mary J. Blige and Beyonce) from the drama queens (who don't even bear mentioning).  If you want complex introspection and social commentary, rent a Spike Lee joint or read Tolstoy, if you want the best R&B CD on the shelf right now, pick up this latest effort from Mariah Carey. It's 14 tracks of self assured, good old fashioned R&B fun.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Yes... punk rockers can be intelligent!  This album is a very mature side of Green Day.  The lyrics are incredible, and the whole layout/story is very creative.  Every single song is great- you will not want to skip any of them.  In my opinion, American Idiot surpasses Dookie, Nimrod and International Superhits by miles and miles (some pretty good albums).
B00003CXDG|4.0|I liked this movie ok but they put <br />like the whole first part of the movie in slow  <br />motion and it drove me crazy the first I watched it <br />so I turned it off then I ended <br />up turning it back on again.Some parts were A little <br />scary I would not reccomend for kids 12 or under <br />And some pepole might think man are you A wuss or  <br />something calling this movie scary but for younger <br />kids it would be.
0316172324|4.0|This book attempts to provide insight into intuitive decision making.  Gladwell starts strong with his prescription for data selection reinforced with fascinating case studies, but the book loses steam.  I definitely prefer his previous book, The Tipping Point, which is more substantive. For solid information on decision making and optimal choices using logic with intuition, read Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self.
B000002NG7|3.0|Faith No More's last album is a bit of an enigma-- for a band known for their metal sound, its the ballads that in fact stand strongest on this one, with vocalist Mike Patton showing a remarkable range of voice, both in pitch and tone, from a sort of neo-soul sound to a Waits-like growl on such brilliant pieces like \\"Stripsearch\\", \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", and the album's almost theatrical (and in many ways presaging for Patton) closer, \\"Pristina\\".  Even some of the rock pieces stand out only because of Patton's superb vocals (\\"Last Cup of Sorrow\\", \\"Naked in Front of the Computer\\"). <br /> <br />Unfortunately, inconsistency on the rock pieces is a problem on this one, really only opener \\"Collision\\", an explosive (and compulsive) rocker succeeds to any great level, the remainder is either a bit lackluster (the aformentioend \\"Last Cup of Sorrow\\", \\"Mouth to Mouth\\") or pretty much throwaway and uninteresting (\\"Got That Feeling\\", \\"Paths of Glory\\"). <br /> <br />Still, its a decent album, worth checking out if nothing else for Patton's vocal performance alone.

1592400876|5.0|I was, as pointed out in the book, one of those who did not believe an interesting book could be written about punctuation.  I was proved wrong by this little book by Mrs Truss.  In it, she details the history and usage of each of the main punctuation marks, making use of typically sarcastic British humor.<br /><br />Her outrage at poor punctuation is a bit overdone and gets tiresome for all but the most passionate readers, but she can be pardoned for she wrote a book that will certainly have a very positive social impact; I am hopeful it will become mandatory reading (the first mandatory book to be well liked, perhaps..) for young children as a way to convince them not only to use good punctuation, but also to pursue good style and follow long held traditions, as these are strng arguments made in the book against modern random usage of punctuation in the internet age.<br /><br />If you have 3-4 free hours, just pick up this book and you will be entertained.  I personally got a bit tired of her sarcasm and had to put it down and pick it up a few days later to finish it off.  I would have liked to have given her 4.5 stars, but the level of research and flow of most of the book push it over the top to a 5 star rating.

They signed with MCA, but the only sign that Enema of the State is a major-label effort is the somewhat cleaner production and the fact that they could afford porn superstar Janine -- all decked out as (surprise!) an enema nurse -- for the album cover. Of course, the lovely Janine is as much an indication as \\"Going Away to College,\\" a catchy little number that pretty much repeats the narrative of \\"Dammit\\": blink-182 is not growing up, no way, no how, nowhere. And that's fine, because few of their peers are quite as blissfully stupid and effortlessly catchy as them. Sure, they might not show the emotional depth of Green Day, but they have good tunes and deliver them in a speedy, punchy fashion. Enema of the State isn't going to change anyone's life -- unless it's the first time a 13-year-old boy has seen Janine -- and it will likely irritate old codgers, but it's a fun record that's better than the average neo-punk release.   <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
0743455967|5.0|I've read several \\"how-to\\" books on writing recently, but this splendid book by Stephen King is by far the best. I have to admit I wasn't sure exactly why King spent a good part of the book writing what essentially amounts to an autobiography, but the purpose of that information became very much apparent as the book progressed. Regardless of what kind of writing you aspire to do, this is a terrific way to get on the right track and learn about the tools and strategies that can help you succeed.
B0000026WD|5.0|If you loved Michael Jackson this LP was one of his very best, freeing him up from the production coffin imposed by \\"Q,\\" Quincy Jones, which was great in the 1980s but which was beginning to sound a bit old fashioned by 1990.  Many hits rose out of this album, even though none of them were able to stand the test of time and few of them continue to be performed today on the rare occasions when MJ now performs live.  It's almost as if, with the exception of HEAL THE WORLD and REMEMBER THE TIME, he is somehow ashamed of this phase in his recording career.  But he shouldn't be, because success or no, it is part of his long progression from Gary, Indiana, to artistic greatness.  Today it is hard to remember a time when we used to se Michael Jackson's face on TV untainted by the current charges that cloud hus visage.  But back in the day he was nearly universally loved and respected for his unique combination of talents and innocence--he was a paradox that you thought you could count on.<br /><br />Some have said that Teddy Riley led MJ down the wrong path with a barrage of intrusive percussions and a taste for verse-chorus-bridge-verse that goes nowhere and seems to start up again at will.  Others have accused Riley of being on an ego trip, appointed the divine rescuer who would somehow \\"save\\" Michael Jackson from his own eccentricities and put him back into r&b with a vengeance.  Michael seemed to be playing up to his own fame, and the videos that grew out of the DANGEROUS LP were playing a game of, how many of my famous friends could I force to appear in the video.  If it wasn't Magic Johnson, it was Naomi Campbell.  Did anyone really think Naomi Campbell was good friendship material?  I don't know her personally, but her screen image is that of one who would just as soon slit your throat as look at you, if there were twenty-five cents to be made doing so.  And what was the idea of Shaq doing the rap verses on the track Jam?  Come on, with all the talented musicians out there why drag in a b-ball star?  At least Janet hired Kathleen Battle not Venus and Serena!<br /><br />Nevertheless when all is said and done DANGEROUS is an epochal achievement and one of the great cultural moments of the late 20th century.out there why drag in a b-ball star?

B00005JNBQ|4.0|I had been putting off seeing NAPOLEON DYNAMITE until very recently, having heard negative reviews such as Roger Ebert's about this movie.  However, I saw the cover of the DVD and thought that it might be one of those \\"quirky\\" movies that sometimes surprise you.  I was right--but NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is that and so much more. <br /> <br />Some reviewers have suggested that the viewer's enjoyment of the movie is derived from looking down on the protaganist and his relatives and friends.  Yes, Napoleon is something of an oddball, gawky and socially awkward.  However, HE doesn't see anything wrong with himself--in some ways, he's actually quite self-assured, as when, early in the movie, he proclaims that he can \\"do whatever (he) wants to do--GOSH!\\"  And while the eccentricities of Napoleon and his circle may be exaggerated, the film, I think, does make the awkwardness of adolescence that is exacerbated by the social mores of high school in a small town beliveable and relatable--I mean, most of us in high school weren't the \\"cool\\" kids--maybe not \\"geeks\\", either, just the vast majority in between.  Napoleon's strength is that he has accepted himself for who he is, although he is sometimes self-deluded (who amongst us wasn't, during high school?).  Thus, I enjoyed the movie because I DIDN'T have to look down on Napoleon and his family and friends--they were just different characters, different kinds of people. <br /> <br />Some reviewers also have suggested that there is no plot to the movie.  I disagree, and suggest that there are several plots running through various parts of the the movie:  (1) How will Napoleon and Pedro find dates for the big dance?  (2) Will Napoleon's brother Kip find his \\"soul mate\\" on the internet?  (3) Will Uncle Rico get his comeuppance?  (4) Can Pedro really win the election for class president?  (5) Will Napoleon and Deb express their feelings to each other?  And the big plot:  Will everybody find a Happy Ending?  <br /> <br />In response to those who feel that the movie is meaningless, I believe that Napoleon sums up the movie's message in one line:  \\"Just listen to your heart. . .that's what I do.\\"  And he does--he lives his life his own way, and he follows his feelings to help his friend Pedro when he really needs support.  He even listens to his heart to catch \\"a delicious bass\\" for Deb, to express his feelings (in a weird way, I'll admit, but a way that's true to himself) to her.  The thing is, Napoleon may be awkward, socially inept, and sometimes clueless, but he isn't a phony.  Sure, his thoughts are filled with fantasy, but he doesn't betray his true character to \\"fit in\\" with everybody else.  <br /> <br />Speaking of true character, take for instance the big school dance.  Napoleon had the courage to ask the \\"cool\\" girl, Brittany, to the dance, even giving her a portrait that he drew for her.  When it looked like he might miss the dance, he began running the who knows how many miles to her house to meet her.  Yet, she ditches him as soon as she can.  Sure, she didn't want to be there with him, but he sure made the effort to be there with her.  And while the movie didn't make the common mistake of making the \\"cool kids\\" irredeemable jerks like in other \\"coming of age\\" movies, the remark by Summer during her campaign speech against the Hispanic Pedro about not wanting to have  \\"chimichangas in the cafeteria\\" leaves no doubt as to who the good guys are in this movie.  Also, to conjecture on why the reticent Pedro would suddenly decide to run for class president, I imagine that he may have been a big shot at his previous school in Mexico, but now he's in an alien environment, speaking his second language, just trying to fit in, when he sees the opportunity to reclaim his self-esteem.  The movie doesn't elaborate this point, so I'm just guessing. <br /> <br />Geez, I didn't mean to get too deep with this movie, which is really a very funny comedy.  While most of the humor comes from the \\"ah-hah, I can relate to that\\" mode, I found the bicycle jump, the chicken farm, and the time machine sequences to be side-splittingly funny.  A lot of the humor is also generated by the eccentricities of the characters themselves.  Kip is obsessed with internet dating.  Uncle Rico is trapped in the year 1982 by his supposed glories on the gridiron.  Pedro cuts off all of his hair.  And Napoleon is Napoleon.  But the filmakers don't go for the easy, obvious laughs.  For example, my wife and I were sure that Kip's \\"soul mate\\", Lafawnduh, HAD to be a transvestite--we were conditioned by Hollywood movies to expect this \\"surprise\\".  Yet, the surprise turns out that this little independent movie has the balls not to follow convention and take the easy way out to cheap laughter.  There is no profanity, no sex, no graphic violence--Gosh, not even any flatulence jokes!!!--the humor in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is truly well-earned and natural, and much the better for it.    <br /> <br />Sorry to have gone on so long about this movie, but I really enjoyed it immensely and HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.  It's not quite in the class of such classic comedies as THE PRODUCERS, DR. STRANGELOVE, or SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, so I'll strictly grade it at four stars (I would actually give it four-and-a-half stars, if I could).  But to find such pleasure in a film that was shot for $20,000, produced for an additional $20,000, then wowed the audience at Sundance, grossed over $40 million at the box office, and is doing gangbusters on its video release, makes NAPOLEON DYNAMITE a treasure by any measure.
B0007Y4USW|4.0|Mariah has returned and just returned in a big way. The Emancipation of Mimi is an album of freedom and breaking away from whatever holds you down. Among the best songs on this disc is \\"We Belong Together\\". The song has a soft and slow beat that entraps you and makes you want sing along. However, this CD isn't perfect. Her collaboration with JD on \\"Get Your Number\\" sort of falls short of good. JD's impression of Nelly in this is quite annoying. In the song \\"Mine Again\\" and \\"Stay The Night\\", Mariah is overusing her vocals to hit some unnecessary notes, however with the exceptions of that, those two beats have a good oldskool feel to them. The best dance songs on the C.D. are her first release, \\"It's Like That\\" which features an unnecessary Fatman Scoop and \\"Say Somethin'\\" with Snoop Dogg, which contains the best beat and productions by the Neptunes. \\"Fly Like A Bird\\", the gospel track on the album,ends to abruptly for me and yet the song's meaning is good. Overall, Mariah is back, she is hotter than ever and the album reaffirms that she is still a bona-fide singing star. <br />
B00005JMYI|1.0|Like some other readers here, I'm amazed at the dichotomy of those who absolutely love this movie and those who can't stand it.  Put me in the latter category.  This truly is sketch comedy at its worst, extended to feature length and including as many diversions and distractions as the director and writers could conjure.  Don't label me a fuddy-duddy for not falling for this garbage.  And obviously, when you make 1000 attempts at a joke, one or two of them will succeed on some level.  There were some chuckles, but no big screaming laughs here. <br />This movie scraped the bottom of the barrel, and shows yet again indeed how hard it is to make a funny movie.  It's certainly more than pasting ideas together and crossing your fingers, like the crew did here.  I DID find the out-takes funny; but then again, I always enjoy them...
1593072937|5.0|With that opening line, I was drawn into the damn finest comic book I've read yet.  I saw the trailer for \\"Sin City\\" and thought it looked very cool.  I've never been into comic books, really, but I decided to go and check out the first \\"Sin City\\" comic to see what I could expect in the film.  Before I read it, I was expecting typical noir: men in raincoats and fedoras skulking around streets in the night. <br /> <br />Ha!  Boy, was I wrong. <br /> <br />\\"Sin City\\" (or as it was later re-named, \\"The Hard Goodbye\\") is film-noir at its darkest, as well as finest.  It's filled with guns, the occasional castration, and it even features cannibalism.  It's the tale of Marv, who makes the Hulk look like a mindless brute.  Marv's in a bad mood tonight, because the only women who ever gave him a chance, Goldie, was just murdered.  So he's on a quest to find the bastard that murdered Goldie and kill him, slowly and painfully. <br /> <br />Frank Miller is a genius.  He creates an absorbing story focusing on an extremely likable and very interesting main character, filled with terrific, colorless drawings.  I never dreamed that comics could be this good, but they sure can. <br /> <br />It's hard to explain \\"Sin City\\" unless you've read it for yourself.  This Second Edition of the book (to tie-in with the release of the film) is well-designed, making it something for collectors to treasure for years to come. <br /> <br />Walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything.
B00005Y7LD|4.0|Other than \\"Cradle Of Love\\", this album doesn't seem to get much mention from anyone, but I love it. In fact, front to back it's my favorite of his. \\"Loveless\\" and \\"Pumping On Steel\\" are both good rockers, and I really like \\"Trouble With The Sweet Stuff\\". He does a good job on The Doors cover too. \\"Prodigal Blues\\" and \\"Endless Sleep\\" are nice mellow touches also. It's a great mix of the older and newer Billy Idol. And best of all, this is DIRT CHEAP! One of few albums I own on cassette, CD and vinyl.
B00005R8FI|5.0|This is John Mayall at his creative best. At a time when music was getting louder, Mayall took it down a notch. Believing that each instrument creates it's own rhyhm, he eliminated drums from his music and set out on his sojourn. The result is \\"Turning Point.\\" This recording not only changed how I looked at the blues, it changed forever how I looked at music altogether!

B0007Y4USW|5.0|I have read about 10 reviews for Mariah's new CD.  I have found that everyone is a bit confused:  Track # 7 Get Your Number feat. Jermaine Dupri, everyone seems to think that it is Nelly doing the hook/chourus  but I just have to let everyone know so that you are not miss informed it is NOT Nelly it IS Pharreal, (who sings with Snoop on Snoop's track \\"Lets Get Blowed\\") that sings/raps the hook.   <br /> <br />I just had to let everyone know b/c you all seem to think you know all about Snoop and Nelly and Rap, yet you can't tell that it is not Nelly.  Other than that the CD is just wonderful.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Just didn't get it.  The characters were dull and aside from different wardrobe, they all seem to be the same character.  I kept waiting for the huge laughter I was hearing about, but I guess the movie ended before that happened.  I must have missed the meeting when we all \\"decided\\" that grade school humor was funny, but if MTV can dictate to a mind numb audience what music to listen to - Hey why not movies too???
B00005KHJR|4.0|This movie is teeming with metaphor and religous allegory, and for the better part of it one is left wondering which is the more savage-Sgt. Howie's tunnel-visioned Christianity or Summersisle's indifference to human life? Both are equally oppressive in their respective beliefs. <br /> <br />I won't give away the plot twists (and there is a doozy of one for the climax,) but the rundown is this: Sgt. Howie has volunteered to travel to a remote island off the coast of Scotland to find a missing girl. As he questions the inhabitants, they initially deny knowing the girl, then grudgingly admit she used to live among them, and that her spirit has been \\"re-born\\" into the earth as the trees, water, air and fire. Whether she died naturally or unnaturally is what Sgt. Howie intends to find out. <br /> <br />The movie paces its creepiness rather oddly. We are shown idyllic scenes of townspeople dancing and singing Scottish folk songs, but underneath is an increasing sense of tension and fear as the pious Sgt. Howie not only tries to do his job, but finds it increasingly difficult to defend his faith when up against the weirdly complacent pagan islanders. There are some very disturbing moments (seeing a group of grown men in animal masks menacing our intrepid hero is just one of them) and the climax is one of the best I've ever seen. Just when you think it's going to be over, it racks up another degree, and while not gory, it's psychological violence left me very shaken.  <br /> <br />As a Christian, I was somewhat offended by Howie's almost cruel intolerence of a belief different from his own. As a Morman, I had an immeadiate empathy with a group of people whose religon is frequently misunderstood or distorted (no polygamy jokes, please!) And most Celtic peoples did not practice human sacrifice, although the ritual use of the green-eyed horse, the half man and half woman and the fool were part of the traditional May Day celebrations to bless the harvest. The actions of the islanders are those of people disillusioned by science and reason, tired of blind Christian faith. They want to take a more active approach to their well-being, even if it means defying modern law and committing horrific murder to insure the future.  <br /> <br />A religon that brooks no tolerance or sympathy with anything other than its own doctrine. Is it Howie's Christianity, or Summerisle's paganism? The Wicker Man leave you to decide.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|No question this in one of the more anarchic cult films released over the last decade, though oddly, it did not do well in wide release. Beats me how anyone could resist an obscenity-laced, scatological puppet show that features copulating marionettes. Of course, the true controversy was that it was - gasp - politically satirical (nearly unheard of in American movies these days, but then, we live in a time where it seems to be dangerous to have an original, if candid, opinion about anything, much less politics). Is \\"Team America\\" good for what ails you? Probably not, but it is good for some gut-diving laughter. Come on, admit it, you're dying to sneak a peek, and alot of folks probably will when this hits DVD. Finally, America will know the truth about itself: we're a nation of closeted puppet-sex fiends. Amen to Parker and Stone for liberating us.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Listen, it's under $20 and worth every penny. That is a good hour spent elsewhere, and this is something you will return to again and again. Easily one of the most ambitious debuts to date and one of the most inspiring as well.  Imagine a massive of all of the best elements of independent music over the past thirty years coming together under one spectular circus tent. The band wears its influences well but creates something original all the same.  Passionately theatrical and intenseiy personal at the same time.  The best music to watch fireworks to since Handel.
B00003CXCT|2.0|What a big contraversy, hey, folks? The problem is, I follow what Lucas does, but talk about &*@#ing the trilogy. Greedo shoots first, and Han is a KEN DOLL in that part. Its so FAKE. Now, I would have minded tis if: <br /> <br />-George Lucas INVISIONED this. <br />-An original version of the trilogy was available, so I dont have to look at the new whiney Aniken at the end of 'Jedi'. <br />-They did at least a LITTLE better on the effects. <br /> <br />But, hey, at least Leah is still in her metal bakinni in 'Jedi'. Yow. Nothing wrong there, eh? <br />Honestly, Lucas. The only thing that does this NEW trilogy justice is the new movies (which are mediocre) and the bonus DVD Without them Lucas would havenever *&%$ed with it. Other that that its OKAY...
B000GUJZ4G|4.0|Why do people slag off Keanu in this movie? Sure, slag off Patrick all you want, cos he was ruined after he did Dirty Dancing - he cannot top that movie! Both stars do spend a lot of time topless, although a lot has to be said for Keanu's lines in this - they are so quotable, even I can quote them, and that's saying something.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are absolutely amazing, particularly some of the final scenes, and the sky-diving scene is breath-taking & scary at the same time. I was disappointed when I watched one of the featurettes on this DVD, to find out how exactly it was done!!! And here's little naive me thinking it was actually done for real. Although Patrick did actually do some jumps himself, fighting with the insurance people, so he could actually do it.<br /><br />I also loved the simplicity of one of the first scenes, where Keanu's suited & booted, and going through the various corridors. It's so simple, yet it looks like it's done in one take. I also love the chase scene between Keanu's character, Johnny Utah, and the main bank robber. It's one of the most adrenaline packed scenes in this movie, and will have you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />I love Keanu in this, I thought Patrick was excellent, one actress/character I did not like was Lori Petty. (Oh my God, how much she's changed in 14 years!) I didn't mind her before, but for some reason, I've suddenly noticed how similar Keanu & Lori looked (then), and it gave me the creeps. I don't know why, they were just too similar looking to be playing lovers in this movie. It's almost incestuous! Of course, there needed to be a female lead, since Johnny is aptly described as being \\"young, dumb and full of cum\\". But I think they could have chosen a better lead than her to be honest.<br /><br />The finale of this movie will leave you exhausted afterwards, as the film packs a lot in. I thought some of the scenes, particularly the surfing & sky-diving scenes could have been done by stunt doubles, as Bodhi (Patrick) looks completely different when he's surfing. Keanu, who learned to surf for his role still surfs as a hobby to this day. I've said about the final sequence before that I didn't like it, but after rewatching it, I do think it does the film justice, and finishes it off nicely.<br /><br />There are two deleted scenes that appear in the trailer, but not actually in the movie itself. Which is a shame! Bodhi and Utah are in Bodhi's truck and Utah is shooting with a gun on the left side. Bodhi is saying \\"This is gonna be a great day, Johnny\\". Also, Utah meets Harp at his office with his surfboard. Harp is angry and saying \\"You are not here to pick up girls, Utah\\". Utah says back \\"The original term is BABES, sir!\\"<br /><br />If you're not American, or don't know your history, like me, you'll have no idea who the ex-presidents are, apart from Richard Nixon. The other two are Jimmy Carter and Lyndon B. Johnson, although I'm at a loss to who the fourth is.<br /><br />There's a body count of 12 in this, and there's no holds barred, particularly since I was expecting there to be some extra bits added in, with my previous viewing experience being on TV. There's lots of gory shots, including some guy getting shot in the foot, Keanu getting rather too close for my liking (and probably his too) to a lawnmower, and a girl beating him up naked. Which I'm sure he enjoyed!<br /><br />Nearly all the stars of the movie appear again to talk in the featurettes, apart from Keanu (really disappointing!) Gary Busey is looking old, as is Lori Petty - shaved head and all, and I'm NOT talking about Gary!!! It's interesting to find out that Anthony from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers actually appears in this (never realised it was him before), and wouldn't turn up for fight rehearsals, so got knocked out straight away!!! Hahahaha!!! (He's the long haired guy that gets shot in the foot, RHCP fans!)<br /><br />This is a movie certainly to be seen, and most of all for Keanu fans, as heappears topless or wet most of the time, and just manages to maintain his modesty when falling out of bed. Damn. Believe me, you can go through that particular scene as slow as you want, and you can't see anything! Almost though. You will not be disappointed.ntain his modesty when falling out of bed. Damn. Believe me, you can go through that particular scene as slow as you want, and you can't see anything! Almost though. You will not be disappointed.

B0000931QA|5.0|I saw the review that this dude MTV rocks gave for Operation Mindcrime and he is an idiot. Geoff Tate has one of the best voices in the history of rock. Go back to listening to the monkees and leave your stupid comments to someone who cares. Operation Mindcrime is an awesome CD. Period.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|From the moment the credits started rolling to the moment they (thankfully) stopped, this overblown and hideous assault on the senses never truly wowed beyond a whimper (as in \\"please stop the madness!\\")  The singing was terrible, the songs were rehashed and misplaced pop tunes (Ewan McGregor, grinning and slinking his way through \\"Your Song\\" by Elton John nearly destroyed my love of the tune), and the storyline was as thin as tissue paper.  My whole family hated it, so one might argue that our dislike of the film is genetic; however, I've run into others to whom I'm not related who also roundly despise this costly puff of fluff.  The only reason it averages 4 stars at Amazon, I believe, is because those of us who disliked it simply can't stand to think about it anymore, thereby keeping us from bothering to write about it.  However, here's my 1 star, and if I could give it none, I would.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin are one of the best rock bands that have ever graced this planet. Their first three albums were awesome, but Led Zeppelin IV (aka ZOSO) is their very best album ever. Stairway to Heaven is a classic rock anthem for the ages, and is still being played on classic rock radio stations to this day. Other great songs on here include Rock and Roll, Black Dog, Misty Mountain Hop, The Battle of Evermore and When The Levee Breaks. This is a must have for Led Zeppelin fans or classic rock fans in general. Great album, buy it now!<br /><br />BTW: Bozo and the Bandwagon of Poop can kiss my ass. I'll bet that idiot has never even heard this album. He thinks that nu-metal is the best. HA! We can listen to whatever we want to, so just go away loser!<br /><br />Now here's the ratings for the songs<br /><br />1. Black Dog: 5/5<br /><br />2. Rock and Roll: 5/5<br /><br />3. The Battle of Evermore: 5/5<br /><br />4. Stairway to Heaven: 5/5<br /><br />5. Misty Mountain Hop: 5/5<br /><br />6. Four Sticks: 5/5<br /><br />7. Going to California: 5/5<br /><br />8. When The Levee Breaks: 5/5
B000286S8S|5.0|Van Halen is without a doubt one of the greatest hard rock bands of all time. Whether they were cutting heavy metal rockers or midtempo power ballads, or whether they were fronted by the dynamic David Lee Roth or the less theatrical but equally talented Sammy Hagar, they always managed to come out on top.<br /><br />\\"The Best Of Both Worlds\\" contains 36 of the best Van Halen tracks ever from both the Roth and Hagar eras (thankfully the Gary Cherone era has been left out entirely). Despite not being in chronological order, this two disc set features all the Van Halen classics.<br /><br />Sure most of you remember when you made out on the night of your senior prom to \\"Dance The Night Away\\" (yes, I know this is stolen from the liner notes, but it's a pretty well known fact), or the first time you crusied down the freeway with \\"Jump\\" blasting out of your car radio, or when you found yourself crying out the chorus to \\"Panama\\" at the top of your lungs,or when you first saw that unforgettable video for \\"Hot For Teacher\\". All these and more are on here.<br /><br />The liner notes are expertly written by David Wild (who seems to be writing the liner notes from every best of these days, from Barry Manilow to Heart). There are no pictures from David Lee Roth, which should tick off the now paramedic (it's true, he's a paramedic now), but there are some great photos.<br /><br />I suggest you ignore the bad reviews and rock out to \\"The Best Of Both Worlds\\". It's time well spent.
B00065JTBA|1.0|Is the title trying to make us believe there are 100,000,000 people out there with musical taste that horrid? I seriously doubt it. This is the apex of banality. So many great bands deserve a box set and what are we getting these days? This and Nirvana. Jesus.
0446677450|5.0|It's amazing how passionate people are about this book.  It's either true love or true hate.  I read the book and thought it had a pretty good foundation on wealthy.  I thought it could have had more details however.  Another book, Stop Working by Rohan Hall has some similar concepts but gives the details on how to execute his strategies for indefinite wealth.  I enjoyed both books but got more from Stop Working because it was less fluff and more specifics.
0765301598|2.0|6 reasons to read/ buy this book: <br />1) You endured the Butlerian Jihad and Machine Crusade and now you just got to know how it all ends. <br />2) You are related to the author/ publisher/ distributer and they are expecting feedback. <br />3) You love bad dialogue and incredibly stupid characters who are doomed to repeat their mistakes over and over and over... <br />4) You are insomniac.  <br />5) You like to throw big heavy books at people when you are mad and believe me there is plenty here to drive you mad. <br />6) You may be one of the few people on the planet who might actually enjoy this book- there aren't many of you, but there are some.
B0006284JQ|5.0|This album is soo amazing, I luv it so much with great songs, she's like POW, POW and then like WHAMM! <br /> <br />I dont know why people are so mean to britney, she is so talented and OMGz!! she even writes her own songs, she is so smart, the lyrics she writes are great, so original and new and witty now that she is like so mature, people are just jealous cuz she's so prety and sexy and sells many records, stop interfering in her life!! <br /> <br />so many sold records how could she be wrong or anything??? its many people that think britney is so great, she even won grammy's, that means she is a real talented artist. only the greatest artist have won grammys and only the greatest have won so many. brintney is for realz! <br /> <br />and britney if your reading this im your fan numba 1!!!! fo'life
0780020685|5.0|Is there anyone who cares about movies who hasn't seen or doesn't know about this one?    The greatest action movie ever made. The greatest historical epic ever made--an epic about obscure people performing obscure deeds in an obscure little village. The first let's-assemble-a-team flick. The film that spawned more first-rate imitations and cheap knock-offs than any other Japanese art film (with Yojimbo running a close second).     Three and a half hours long and not an ounce of fat on it. Every scene--every shot!--performs three or four functions simultaneously: it moves the narrative forward, introduces or complicates a character, establishes a setting, introduces themes or motifs, clarifies and develops important points, etc. The directorial virtuosity on display here is awe-inspiring (it rivals Citizen Kane in its cinematic ingenuity). Take for example my favorite scene, the one that introduces the three main characters, the wise leader Kambei, the admiring young Katsushiro, and the swaggering oaf \\"Kikuchiyo\\". There is hardly a word spoken in this scene, yet the characters of these three men are indelibly established in the briefest of glimpses, all while keeping the audience in suspense as to how, or whether, an infant will be rescued from a crazed, panicky thief who has taken it hostage. Note the brilliant, subtle manipulation of time in this scene (it ends with a dramatic slow-motion death, a move that Sam Peckinpah later ripped off and built an entire career around). And that's just one of dozens of equally remarkable scenes in the film. The cinematography is gorgeous, too--a rich, silvery black-and-white with dazzlingly sharp deep-focus landscapes, interiors, and portraits. Freeze the film at practically any frame and you've got an Ansel Adams photograph.    Criterion has done a nice job of transferring the film to DVD. The images are crisp and clear, marred only by some tiny scratches. (Criterion has never matched the amazing transfer job it did with Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress.) Contrary to what some Amazon reviewers believe, the movie is presented here in its original aspect ratio: Kurosawa did not make a widescreen film until 1957, three years after he made Seven Samurai. Extras include an interesting commentary by foreign-film distributor Michael Jeck, who gives detailed histories of the various actors who appear in the film and discusses some of the cinematic techniques that make Seven Samurai so effective and affecting.    On second thought, don't waste your time and money on this dismal little dud. Buy the deluxe super-bit two-disc collector's edition of Martin Brest's awesome Gigli instead.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|At the end of the first movie, Neo figured out that it was all a program that he could manipulate at will. Then he went back to hand-to-hand combat in the 2nd and 3rd movies. That is just absurd. And instead of flying around, he could have simply popped in at a different location like the agents do.  <br /> <br />The other thing I didn't like was the move away from the sharp camera angles. The first movie felt like a comic book with really high angles showing the rain fall, etc. The 2nd and 3rd degenerated into a flat faux goth feel. The messianic theme seemed to disappear as well.
B0007GADZO|2.0|I stopped buying Steve Vai's stuff for awhile. It was too out there for anyone that wasn't demented. I thought I'd pop back in seeing as Sheehan was back in the mix and see what was up... well, $15 is an expensive coaster. Yea got me Steve, I admit it. <br /> <br />The production is thin and tinny. The direction is profoundly silly. The playing is good but lacks any sort of form to make it special. Think: \\"Firegarden\\" but twice as muddled. <br /> <br />I'm not sure if the thought is that \\"some day\\" the world will see how brillant this stuff is but I highly doubt it, that's about as likely as a true Mad Max style future. It's an odd feeling to LOVE Joe Satriani, think Steve is the better guitarist, and yet NOT want to listen to Steve. It has a lot to do with what is being recorded and not the talent involved. <br /> <br />And for the Love of God, stop singing. Please??
B00080ZG10|2.0|Wow, the first word that come to mind when I think of this movie is \\"Overrated\\". This movie drags on so much its crazy. This movie is so overrated, unless your a diehard aviation/ howard hughes fan it might be acceptable. Who knows maybe when I turn 20 Ill start to appreciate this movie, but for now, it aint gonna happen. I really wanted to like this, I dragged my friend along to see it. But in the end, I cringed and thanked God it was over. There are a few good bits in the movie, like the acting, the acting was over the top top notch, especially from Cate Blanchette who won an Oscar for her great performance of Katharine Hepburn, Leonardo DiCaprio, done OK though, it wasnt really a Jamie Foxx \\"Ray\\" type of performance but still it was quite good. It does indeed get boring, the cinematography brings it to life though, it is great. The DVD bonus features looks fun to explore around, it looks good.<br /><br /> Overall Its boring, overrated, great acting and cinematography and the directing was good.<br /><br />Plus: Dont watch this without knowing what the story is about.<br /><br />  Acting *****<br /><br />  Cinematography *****<br /><br />  Directing ****<br /><br />  Overall Movie **
B000002H38|5.0|Ladies and gentlemen  . . . . the best r&b album of ever, no one like her, emotions, love and tenderness. <br />yes the album of my life, 8 songs like no others. <br />sweet love, been so long, caught in the rapture. . . .  <br />these songs will stay in our hearts for ever <br />anita che Dio Ti protegga
B000002A46|5.0|This is the best christmas album released in the 90's.  Combination of Classical and Pop, Carey's voice is astonishing.  Her versions of O' Holy Night is remarkable, with the highest note hit ever, and the danceable \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\" is one of the best track of the album and soon to be considered classic.   <br />A must have for every Carey fan, and for those who believe in the spirit of Christmas.
B0002EXH40|4.0|Now don't get your shorts in a bind. Dave isn't pulling an \\"Ozzy\\" on us by replacing all the original instruments (as far as I can tell), but he definitely re-recorded at least some of the vocals on Tout Le Monde for some strange reason. I never had a problem with the original vocals and actually preferred them to this version, but oh well. It's now Dave's ultimate vision for his record so who am I to say?  I made the usual mistake of getting rid of my older versions when I heard \\"remasters\\" were coming out, but at the time, had I known these were also going to be remixed and touched up versions, I would have kept them for comparison. So I have to go by my memory of the original versions.  Another difference I believe I'm hearing is at the end of \\"Train\\" where the harmonica comes in. It now sounds to me more cluttered with noises than before because the rhythm guitars seem lost in the muddle. It just sounds different and I'm not sure I like it a whole helluva lot now. And \\"Addicted to Chaos\\" has been touched up in the chorus section, with quieter harmony guitar and what I believe to be a new harmony vocal by Dave. Why? What the heck for?  Youthanasia as a whole is one of my favorite Megadeth albums, though. The strength of the riff-writing is fabulous on here, with songs like \\"Reckoning\\", \\"Train\\", and \\"Addicted\\" featuring one great, heavy riff right after another. The much-maligned tune \\"Victory\\" also has some killer riffs, but the lyrics--a series of Megadeth song titles thrown together in random order--appear to be more for Dave's amusement and self-servitude than anything. I say, let Judas Priest be the only ones who quote their own titles in songs, because it's just a goofy thing to do and the fewer bands which partake of this inane practice the better. And here is where we begin to miss Dave's snarl, as he continues his attempts at real \\"singing\\"...well, I'll just let that topic rest.  I don't have much to say about the bonus tracks, except that they fare better than most bonus tracks--i.e. songs not good enough to put on record--because they are pretty decent.   Dave's liner notes are informative and he points out how A tout Le Monde is his favorite song on here. A shame really, as it's my least enjoyed tune, but I suppose it has some deep special meaning to him that no one else is supposed to relate to. He also mentions that he wanted the remixing to emphasize just how heavy the record really is, but I don't hear it being any heavier than it used to be.  Overall, I'm not entirely sure that I would prefer this version over the original recording, but the great songs are still great.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I must say that I was very hesitant about buying this cd. I was concerned about all of the drama that has surrounded Mariah in the last few years, especially with the disapointing \\"Glitter\\" as well as \\"Charmbracelet\\".  After reading all of the good reviews on this website, I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad that I did.  Mariah appears to have something to prove to all of those that doubted her (me) and left her when she needed them most.  Her cd is the bomb and I'll even venture to say that this is the best cd yet that's been released by her.  I love the first single \\"It's Like That\\", but my favorite right now is \\"Stay the Night\\".  I don't know if she's speaking from past experience or not, but I will say that it's a song that most of us ladies can relate to.  Welcome back Mariah and may this hits keep coming for years to come.
0446608955|5.0|Nicholas Sparks took me on a fabulous journey to discover the truth about love in uncommon places. His poise of writing amazes me as he so vividly describes to us the love between Landon and Jamie.<br /><br />Landon Carter was heading into trouble in his senior year. Until the night of the dance, when he doesn't have anyoune to go with, so he invites the reverend's daughter, good girl, Jamie Sullivan. Through a series of events, Landon finds himself in love with her. But, unknown to him, she has a secret that could affect his life forever. This book truly is a walk to remember. I would recommend reading the book before seeing the movie, due to Hollywood, some of Sparks' genius is not in the movie. Read this book and you will not regret it.
B0007O38F8|5.0|(...)Everyone who critisizes this album is a fan of ja rule. Yeah i said it, your all JA RULE FANS. If your not a complete pudd-ie, then pick this cd up ya wreck. But then again it's been out for a while so if you haven't picked it up already, don't bother becuase your not smart enough to get what's hot when it drops.
B000001XO3|5.0|Along with Furtwangler's Scala Ring, this is my favorite one.  And since the sound is better, this one is easier to listen to. Krauss'\\"Siegfried\\" is my favorite.  I will never understand why so many people consider Solti's Ring as benchmark.  To me his is the least exciting. Karajan is too \\"precious.\\"  The characters never come alive in either of those, at least not like they do for Krauss and Furtwangler.  Highly recommended as one of the top choices, far above Solti and Karajan.
B000002J0B|5.0|Raw yet lyrical. Mystical yet macho. Psychedelic but (you know) heavy metal. This is perhaps my favorite album by Led Zeppelin and it is the one where Page's fascination with the ancient and the occult most clearly shines through.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|Although most Marley fans are more than familiar with Babylon by Bus as an exceptional live album that Marley recorded while on tour in Europe (mostly recorded in Paris) in 1977-78, many of the more pedestrian fans remain completely unaware of its existence.  War/No More Trouble, with Marley exhibiting such unparalleled and genuine passion during its performance, makes for undoubtedly the most powerful song on this CD.  And, suffice it to say, all of the other 'hit' songs do not disappoint by any stretch.  A must own for any true Marley fan -- period.
0385510454|1.0|I have been a Grisham fan since I read his first book.  But with this one it seems he has begun to coast on his name. <br />I read and read and read just knowing that there was going to be some really good surprizes in this book or at least a super good ending.  But neither happended. <br />When I read the last page I felt really let down.  It was overall a very boring book.
B000059XUO|5.0|Inspired securely by Poe's poem, the horror atmosphere and gothic environment load every frame of the film: dark, morbid, hallucinating, harrowing carves in relief the revenge in search of a later redemption, though the sinister facts that awfully culminated with the absurd accident in which Brandon Lee died, signed this film with a stigma hard to forget and overcame by far, the original purpose of the script.<br /><br />Brandon Lee: in memoriam.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Buble's first album \\"Michael Buble\\" is excellent.<br /><br />He comes back well with \\"It's time\\" and takes alot of risk.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great lounge singer in the genre of Dino and Frank, you have found it in Buble.  He's one of the modern best and really gets under the notes.<br /><br />With this said, some songs don't work quite as well as his first album.  I give him full credit for trying to remake the Beattle's \\"Can't buy Me Love\\" in a 1950s jazz version.  However, it didn't work that well.<br /><br />Buble knocks it out of the park with \\"Feeling Good\\" and \\"A Foggy Day.\\"<br /><br />You won't go wrong with this album.  But start with his first first.
B00000DLUO|5.0|I just knew about this golden treasure album due a magnificent surprise gift of one beloved and estimated friend, last Saturday. In this work Evans once more exhibits with all his virtues some little and intimate musical gems. Michel Legrand' s What are you doing the rest of your life? is played with such introspective mood as I had never listened never before. Why did I choose you? expresses with meditative and serene calm, a decisive love's homage. Lullaby for Helene and Like someone on love make of this CD an appropriate pretext to listen over and over under the twilight, dawn, proving once more the artistic stature of this everlasting jazz legend.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|Another classic case of \\"what it could've been\\". This film will easily wow you in its opening 10 minutes only to dissapoint you as it progresses. This is ultimately how it will be remembered. <br /> <br />\\"Sky Captain...\\" is based on 30s-40s aesthetics and 50s sci-fi films and it aims to cash in on the nostalgia factor for the old classics. On a visual level it does extremely well. On an intellectual level it does poorly.  <br />   A plot that borders infantile conception cant possibly be compensated by the awe-inspiring visuals, CGIs, and great cinematography in general. The average western viewer has outgrown that. <br />   The old and cliched storyline of an abstract bad guy threatening the world for abstract reasons doesnt wash any more. Not when the good guys are as mindless and simpletonic as the ones portrayed in this film, to the point where a choice as to whom to identify with could be decided through a coin toss. <br /> <br />  On top of that, a plot with seriously insulting holes as the one here, only makes for further damage on the film's effectivity, especially when these inconsistencies are eye-poking at best and cant be ignored unless you're someone who could ignore stomping elephants in your living room. <br /> <br />   And as for acting...Well...You cant possibly ask for acting when the actors barely have time to utter some trivial line in-between explosions and air-chases. A very competent actor like Jude Law goes pointlessly wasted in this flick. They could've hired anybody for such a low-expectations job and the the dent on people's reputation participating here would be avoided. <br /> <br />   But among all this mess, there's the positives that i started of with: <br />   the director has done a truly outstanding job capturing the feeling of 50s sci-fi. The fact that he's done it in a hollow manner is the other side of the coin. But he did do great in that sector. It's not only the clever usage of colour that achieved this, but also the carefully depicted \\"primitive\\" technology (seeing the hilarious giant robots will convince you of this. This doubled with some well inspired ideas realised by the CGI makes it an optical feast. <br />  I'd go as far as say that if you watched this with the voice off you'll be alot more rewarded than otherwise. And less cerebrally insulted. <br />   A definitely good try but certainly not worth the cigar. <br />
0684800713|5.0|This challenging work by Hemmingway is not only his most profound work, but the quintessential piece on \\"The Lost Generation.\\" The main character Jake is scarred not only physically but emotionally, and these barriers prove to be impossible to cross to get to his love, the Femme Fatal Brett. The peice shows the attitude that the age of enlightenment had only produced more efficient means to kill eachother in the trenches of world war two, and that no one could ignore the monstrosity of human nature. Isn't it pretty to think that we as humans could if we worked hard enough achieve our goals?
B00000IQW3|3.0|I Was wondering if anyone noticed the sceens that are missing from the movie that i did. like when the robot is sent to impersonate the star in the movie he makes a pass at his girlfriend and she slaps him. or when they are at the lake with friends sitting on a log smoking pot. why do they cut movies up when they go to tapes or dvd ?
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|The cover on this album should of given you a dead give away clue alreay.    There is a reason Ray Charles has that retarded smile, he is dead, and yet he is still cashing in on a gullible and other wise mindless public with this abberation of plastic and aliminum.    The movie about him came out last October, which has caused a sudden interest in his music.How timely was it that this was released to coincide with the sudden public interest in Ray Charles in order to cash in.Yes my freinds, good ol Ray is laughing at you all now,just look at the picture on this cd cover. Why do i hate this? because it is a brainless attempt at cash from record companies, Ray is laughing at the people who bought this. This is basically an album of cover songs with random contrived celebrity artists and singers preforming with Ray. If i want to listen to Ray, i will buy one of his original albums instead of this piece of crap. They literally butcher the classics, Ray was in an ailing state when he did this so i don't blame him at all, the other artists on the other hand.....    God, this is just (...) horrible! get one of Ray's original albums.If it weren't for the movie, people wouldn't even be interested in him, it is a classic example of flavor of the month and the publics stupidity. Ray was a good musician but by no means a god like every one makes him out to be.I like to think that i have pretty diverse musical tastes,i like every thing from John Cougar Mellencamp to Slayer,but i can't see what makes this guy so great or legendary at all.This whole CD is basically a Ray Charles @ss kissing fest, just read the liner notes and see it with your own eyes.    It's another record companies dream come true. A poor album that sells by musicians names rather then the qaulity of the music it self.There is no technical reason for this to even exist.
0452270073|5.0|This book is a tremendous and subtle work of art. The story revolves around the hositalization of poet, Siegfried Sassoon, for shell shock during World War I. He is being treated by Dr. Rivers, psychiatrist and anthropologist. The conversations, memories, and internal dialogues of these two men make up much of the book. How does an intelligent and refletive man come to try to give meaning to a meaningless and pointless catastrophy such as World War I. This is Sassoon's dilemna. He is against the war, not as a religious objector or a pacifist, but because he has come to see it as meaningless, pointless, horror imposed on the youth of Europe by an arrogant, stubborn, ruling class. Sassoon struggles during his hospitalization with the grief of losing young friends to the war, the frustration and irony of knowing that the excessive killing was pointless, and that he must find meaning in his sacrifice if he is to return to the front lines. Dr. Rivers is in a similar situation. He must assist men who have had a nervous breakdown compensate just enought to be returned to the front lines where they will no doubt be cannon fodder. He heals so that the sacrifice may continue.  <br /> <br />The ethical and historic issues abound in this beautifully written novel. Whereas Joseph Heller in Catch 22 plays on the dark humor of the absurdities of war; Barker does not go for the sarcastic humor of the hanged. Rather, she takes a much more existentialist approach, of exploring how we try to create meaning to survive pointless and disasterous situations. I was reminded of Edith Stein, Ph.D., the phenomenologist philospher who became a Dutch nun but was then gased by the Nazis. While being transported by train across Germany to the gas chambers she tried to make sense of her senseless situation. She decided that she would offer herself up to God as the sacrificial lamb so that he might end the insanity and destruction of World War II. You will see that Sassoon stuggles with a similar situation, how to return to an absurdly deadly war with a sense of meaning, even if that meaning has to be forged out of our own soul and exists only for ourself.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|It took me some time to get this CD, and most of all because I was waiting to read all the reviews about it (here in Amazon). One reviewer wrote: \\"the best CD of their career\\", another one said: \\"the best CD of the year\\", etc.    Now let me tell you this, Kreator has always been my favorite band, I know every single song they have written, every single album... and I saw them live two times. So I can dare to say that I know a lot about this band and it's evolution. But I will not rate one of their albums with 5 stars just because it is Kreator.    This album is good... rather good!!! The songs are fast, brutal, raw, melodic and yet very complex. The lyrics are simply great, and the solo riffs will make you go: \\"what the f***!!\\".  Mille has proved that he is one of the best musicians in the heavy metal scene.... simply phenomenal.    The fact is that I wouldn't say that this is their best CD of their career, but it is one of the best ones indeed. For example, I liked \\"Violent revolution\\" a lot, but I prefer this one.  \\"Enemy of God\\" has it all: speed, attitude, brutality, aggression, melody... and most of all: Hate.     Rating: 9/10. That means: go and get it!!!    In my opinion the best songs are: Enemy of God, World Anarchy, When Death takes its dominion and the Ancient plague.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|I had high hopes for this album after 2 previous great releases.  And at first listen it does sound good.  The hooks are VERY catchy.  The problem is, that's all this album has got.  Hooks looped over and over.  Maybe it would make for good dancefloor music, but not anything else.  I've tried to enjoy it in my car, but after the first 30 seconds I'm bored and want to skip to the next one..which cause the same thing to happen.<br /><br />It seems like Daft Punk thought they would be selling their songs to companies for 30 second commercials, similar to their brethren Air.  Yes, Robot Rock would make a great Volkwagen commerical track.  But real music it most certainly is not.  Even today's youth with their short attention spans must surely get tired of this effort quickly.  Let's hope the guys get their act together for the next album.
B0000640SA|5.0|Ok, a friend of mine comes to me and lends me a copy of Memento saying that this is a movie you are going to love.  5 months later doing nothing at home I see the movie.  Well..WOW! I mean it's not the best movie ever, but from the openings to the final credits I couldn't take my eyes from the screen.  It really kept me think what was going to happen next.  Relly enjoyable movie.  I agree...a few mistakes, but very tolerable, and well it's just a picture so enjoy it.  Highly recommended.
B000002U82|5.0|if no one else will do it i guess i will: \\"A KID SHUT UP!\\" <br /> <br />What have you got against this masterpiece of an album? <br /> <br />It is consistantly voted one of the greatest albums ever made and usually tops most critics lists as the most influential record of all time. <br /> <br />Pink Floyd inspired a generation of musicians with their albums. Dave Gilmores guitar playing is imperial and is in my opinion up there with Hendrix and Page as one of the greatest guitarists of all time <br /> <br />If you've never listened to Pink Floyd this is a great album to begin with it sums up a lot of what Pink Floyd are about and their musical style. <br /> <br />The album has sold 40m copies, if i were you i'd make it 40million and one!
B00004TDRD|5.0|Hey guys, Here is a young Spielberg here directing Roy Schider.  When at the beach at Amity, a shark lurks and feeds on prey when July 4th comes around.  I won't tell you what happends and thats probably because you know how it ends.  Spielberg directs a great film that was nominated for best picture but lost.  A great job by all who are part of this mega hit!  One thing, Don't go NEAR THE WATER after seeing this film!
B00004W221|4.0|I just finished watching the DVD of this movie.  Based upon a true story, it is one of the best sports movies that I have seen and one of the better movies of all genres.  The acting is supurb.  Rudy battles against almost insurmountable obstacles to reach his lifelong dream.  I felt Rudy's emotions as the movie progressed and the beautiful orchestral score helps to draw the viewer/listener into the story.  The quality of the DVD is first-rate and the special features and interviews help to give the viewer insight into Rudy's story. <br /> <br />If you cry at movies, plan to shed a few tears of joy with Rudy.
B000006FH5|5.0|Wow what a great choice for Clark Kent/Superman.  Reeve did a great job here.  Hackman is also fine as the arch enemy Lex Luthor.  This is a great movie to see over and over again.
B0007WZUMO|5.0|Dont' listen to people who try to play this cd off as \\"shock rock,\\" or \\"typical industrial,\\" believe me, they are very ignorant to what this CD actually sounds like. Covering new ground, NIN shows more experimentation than ever, throwing out old cliches judgemental people try to label them with, and coming out with songs that are borderline poppish, without neglecting substance. This entire album is filled with great drum and bass grooves, and unlike the other two epics released before (THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL, THE FRAGILE) it is less about angst and more about overcoming challenges, and finding hope. There is only one song on here that could be called typical, but the rest are very experimental. Their first single \\"The Hand That feeds\\" was a dangerous experiment, as it is upbeat and poppy, but alongside the next single, ONLY, it proves just how much depth the NIN sound has, whether people want to hear it or not. This album is packed with grooves, inspiring lyrics, and energy, and beauty (yes beauty) beyond words. There is enough here to please the old NIN  fans, and plenty to bring new ones. This is the best NIN album to date.
B000159EEW|5.0|This is Spielberg's best effort as a director of all time!  A great movie with black and white segments and color touches throughout!  His directing is superb and the cast is outstanding!  Liam Neeson  Heads an all star cast in this well developed epic whic by the way won Best Picture and gave Spielberg his first ever oscar for his outstanding directing job!  Spielberg shows us all a different type of movie here that has never been filmed before.  It is entirely filmed in Europe.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|I think that Peterson made a good attempt at this, but despite some good performances, along with a first class musical score to accompany this highly overrated flick, I thought it just was, and just is just sucks! Plain and simple, Brad Pitt tried too hard, Orlando Bloom played the sleaze right to the tee, and still had me plugging my nose during parts of this. I thought that the best performance belonged to Brendan Gleeson, especially during his fight scene with Bloom, where he took me back to the days of Hamish in \\"Braveheart\\"! Brian Cox showed excellence like he always does. In my opinion, he doesn't do poorly.<br /><br />Now I know that this is based on Homer, possibly the pride of the Greeks, the great story of Achilles and the Trojan horse, who knows what else. But I wasn't impressed. Some of it actually seemed phony. I loved the line where the dude's carving the horse (this is near the end, for those of you who are asking questions) and says, \\"Makin' this for my boy.\\" HMM, wonder what's gonna happen after that? See, I really don't think they had jock straps back then, but they do now. The reason is because this was overrated arrogance that took up too much of my time, and WHACK!!! kicked itself right in the crotch! The sad thing is, they probably don't even feel it. If it weren't for the $$ pouring in from the publicity, they'd be saying OUCH!!, and rightfully so.
0064400018|5.0|I gave this book five stars because you learn a lot about life long ago.  I like these books because you can learn about the past and how people lived back then.  You can learn how people hunted and how they cooked
B00005KB9X|5.0|Natty Dread is my favorite Bob Marley album, and every stupid college kid who has only listened to his greatest hits compilation should buy it so they can know what Marley was really about. The entire album in fantastic, but tracks 3-5 are the highlight of the album for me, because they're so raw and powerful. This is the first reggae album I ever listened to and it had me hooked. It's a great starting point for anyone interested in the genre and honestly, it's just a hard album for anyone not to like. I mean, if you don't like Natty Dread, that's like saying you don't like bread, or sex, or sunshine. It's just silly.
0974153001|5.0|If you are new to figure sculpting then this is the book you've been looking for. <br /> <br />It shows you everything in a step-by-step guide with numerous explanations and photos. <br /> <br />It has helped me immensely in my own learning. <br /> <br />I highly recommend it.
B000063JDE|1.0|This movie is so bad, it deserves its own genre. I think I'll call it \\"film crappe\\". In the 80s, many gutsy directors experimented with an unconventional style as a response to the straightforward Speilberg formula we all know so well. Some directors were successful while others were just plain clumsy. <br /> <br />Blue Velvet falls solidly into the latter category. It is basically a Hardy Boys Nancy Drew story peppered with a lot of profanity, weird close-ups, and sexual grossness. \\"Sexual grossness\\" means that these scenes are so unglamorous and disgusting that not even John Holmes could get turned on. Trust me on this; I never thought I'd be yelling at the screen \\"Put your clothes on, Isabella, for all that's holy! I've seen enough beer belly for one night!\\" <br /> <br />Artistically speaking, Lynch wavers between surreal and stupid. The film begins quite well but quickly degrades as soon as the actors open their mouths. Dialogue isn't Lynch's strong point. He should stick to gore. <br /> <br />I'll give you one example of the film's cheesiness: In one scene, Laura Dern and Dune Boy (forgot his name) are talking in a car. She is describing her dream about God & love. The music goes to a pipe organ. They drive off, and the camera zooms in on a church for 3 full seconds. If you find this laughable, then man there's a lot more where that came from. <br /> <br />And just a personal pet peeve: Laura Dern's face when she cries. She does that annoying thing where it looks like she's smoking a stogie out of each side of her mouth. Fingernails on the chalkboard!!
B0000AQVCL|1.0|This is the saddest and most disgusting thing that I have ever had the unfortunate fate of having to listen to. I'm so dissappointed that Amazon does not have a 'zero' star option for vapid crap like this. <br /> <br />From the start to finish the album reeks of poor musicianship, lack of creativity, and a blatant disrespect of rock music and listeners alike.  <br /> <br />Perhaps most heinous are the undeserving comparisons to AC/DC... Not for a second was I under the chronically mistaken impression that I was listening to anything more than a regurgitated, rank, sorry excuse for music. As a musician, I am offended by the release of this record. <br /> <br />Why listen to this shamelessly pretentious, spurious, unconvincing noise when the real thing is so much better. If you want some rock music, buy some music from AC/DC, The Darkness, The Music, Guns N Roses, or Led Zeppelin, and leave the flithy sin that is Jet to MTV.
B00000INL5|5.0|This is Dire Straits' best CDs ever behind Making Movies. Making <br />Movies is great, Brothers in Arms is good but not the very best. <br />The songs I can play over N' over again are The Bug, Heavy Fuel, <br />& My Parties which are one of my favorites on this album. The weakest songs are probably Iron Hand, & Ticket to Heaven. Now <br />I'll review all these great songs in order. <br /> <br />1. Calling Elvis: 10/10 One of my favorite songs on this album. <br />I like this song as an opener the guitar work is totally the best <br /> <br />2. On Every Street: 10/10 Great song! Perfect song for me. The ending is really great with \\"Heavy Fuel\\" style rock N' roll <br /> <br />3. When It Comes to You: 9/10 This track reminds me of Peoria, IL <br />because they play country rock music in this song <br /> <br />4. Fade to Black: 8/10 This track is kinda jazz! It's good but never a hit or classic. <br /> <br />5. The Bug: 10/10 One of my favorites on this album! This is a really fast rock N' roll song with a great intro. Also, like I <br />said before, this is a track I can listen to over N' over again <br /> <br />6. You and Your Friend 8/10 The guitar work is great and the vocals are totally amazing <br /> <br />7. Heavy Fuel 1,000,000/10 The best hard rock song ever! This is <br />my favorite song on this album and this track makes me laugh with <br />\\"LUST AND FOOD AND VIOLENCE\\", very funny. Any rock fan needs to <br />listen to this song because this song is the best song ever <br /> <br />8. Iron Hand 2/10 Not their greatest and like I said before, this <br />is the weakest song off the CD <br /> <br />9. Ticket to Heaven 1/10 This song is kinda the saddest song DS <br />ever wrote and this is another one of the weakest songs off the <br />album <br /> <br />10. My Parties 100/10 I love this song. This song rocks very hard <br />and makes me laugh and is one of my favorite songs on the CD. <br />Great song <br /> <br />11. Planet of New Orleans 9/10 Slow opening but the end is really <br />the best ever <br /> <br />12. How Long 4/10 This song is kinda too country for me and I am <br />not a country music fan <br /> <br />Go out and buy this album today because this album totally has <br />some really great songs and when you buy this, buy Making Movies <br />with it to match two great CDs. Don't get me wrong Brothers in <br />Arms isn't as good as this album. <br /> <br />Thanks. <br />Review from William Vogt II
B00005JNDZ|3.0|What is a young woman supposed to do when she is torn between two lovers? That is the question posed by this movie, \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\". Renee Zellweger is back in the main role as Bridget Jones in this continuation of the original Bridget Jones from 2001. And this time around, she is forced to choose between her new lover, Mark, and her former lover, Daniel.<br /><br />This movie is the type that most will find agreeable enough to give it a chance, but it isn't as loaded with laughs as some viewers will hope. I found only a couple of scenes funny, and I started to wonder why the movie was billed as a romantic comedy. It is really more dramatic than humorous, and many of the attempts at humor are tired and worn out- the type of humor you hear over and over again in movies.<br /><br />I didn't care much for the storyline of this movie, mainly because it is so ordinary. How many times have we seen a movie like this- one that portrays a woman who is torn between two men, feels jealous about the new guy, but is still attracted in a strange way to the former lover, even though he has betrayed her trust in the past? It is the same old formula from Hollywood that we have grown to expect, but would like to see changed.<br /><br />I like the performances of the three main characters; Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant. They all bring a certain degree of charm to their respective roles and they all seem believable, although it is difficult to look at Hugh Grant as a bad guy. He just doesn't have a nasty- enough look to fulfill this role, even if his bad reputation is because of dishonesty in relationships.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent flick, and those who enjoyed the first Bridget Jones will probably like this one too. There isn't anything particularly memorable about it, but there is enough entertainment overall to make it worthy of seeing just once.
076790592X|5.0|In many finer points I disagree with Morrie, but that is besides the questioning now. Time is to say something about the book, and not only about the book.<br /><br />There is a question that every one of us would have to answer alone, nad he will ask himself the question when he suddenly becomes aware (or, as Morrie would put it: \\"As he starts to believe\\") that he is going to die. What kind of question it will be depends on many things, and answers vary in such ways that no two can ever be the same. But one thing that we'll sure wnat answer for is an answer to:\\" How have we lived our life?\\"<br /><br />There are much philosophical doctrines out there, and there are even more religions, and way of the world has never been harder to find, but yet, somehow, everything is connected. With what, you may ask, and answer would be love. It is not the twisted, perverse kind of love of modern authors, and modern world, it doesen't have to do anything with sex, or pleasure, it is just the pure love....caring for another being just for the sake of it being what it is. And, maybe, indeed that is all that we need for  happy, full life.<br /><br />This is sad book, and I did wept as I was reading it, and I think that there is no person in the world who haven't done the same, but it leaves us with a frail notion oh hope, that not everything is yet lost, and that we can make the world better, if we only stop, pause nad think. We are living furious life, an \\"urban\\" one as you might call it and it has it's ups and downs...Maybe we have to pause...to let the world rest for awhile while we compose ourselves, and start behaving in a certain different way....<br /><br />I'll put aside the litteral value here, it really is of no concern, you should put your mind on Morrie and his life, and what he is saying...and maybe, just maybe, we'll have some kind of beginning...
B000002I25|5.0|A highly successful debut album, \\"The Doors\\" is one of the best albums ever by an American rock band. Each and every song, from the perfect opening track \\"Break on Through\\" all the way to the brilliant closing song, \\"The End\\", is excellent in its own way.<br /><br />Most casual listeners will recognize \\"Light my Fire\\" and \\"Break on Through\\", since both of these were released as singles. But these are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this album's listening pleasure. Even though you may not recognize the other titles, the songs are sure to please. They all feature the cosmic/psychedelic sound of Ray Manzarek's keyboards and they all stand out for various reasons as excellent songs.<br /><br />Deep, inspired lyrics can be found on most every song on this collection. Morrison, with his unusual and often seductive vocals, hits you in the center of your consciousness as he sings, with lyrics that are thoughtful and memorable. The rest of the band adds its own signature sound, coming together to create a masterpiece.<br /><br />Ray Manzarek steals the show on this collection with his keyboard mastery and he deserves credit for helping to create the band's signature sound for this debut album. He, and the rest of the band,  make \\"The Doors\\" one of the best debut albums ever and one that belongs in every music fans CD collection.
B0007QJ1MK|1.0|Big fan of Kyuss. Liked \\"Restricted\\". LOVED \\"Songs\\"- thought it was brilliance. But this, sorry to say, is a total disappointment. Where's the aggression? The melody? The balls? The hooks? the SONGS?? It's like Homme took all his most repetitive ideas and made a messy, boring joke just to see who was still listening. There's the odd good riff; he's talented, after all. But mostly it's totally flat. I hate it. I'm giving my copy away. Spend your dinero on the new \\"Corrosion of Conformity\\" instead, it's MUCH, MUCH better music. Peace!
B000000WF9|2.0|This release should have been titled Michael Nyman: Gattaca Soundtrack, since that's all that it is. A collection of Nyman's tracks.  <br /> <br />And yes, they are very good, no doubt about it, but where is Charlie Haden and Stan Getz's exquisite \\"First Song (for Ruth)\\", the wonderfully emotional smoky jazz number from the scene on the dancing floor? And what happened to Django Reinhardt's \\"Nuages\\" ? <br /> <br />If they included ALL THE ARTISTS' work on this cd, it would earn the right to be called \\"a soundtrack\\". Why did the producers emphasize only Nyman? Don't they want to make the best soundtrack compilation for us from the music pieces the movie provides? No, they don't. Including Nyman exclusively was a marketing decision, and not a move towards satisfying their listeners. For that - this cd gets one star. Since Nyman's work is so good, i'll give it two stars.
B000005ILF|3.0|The first chords of the cd suggest an album of mysterious atmosphere.  It lasts for about 5 songs, then loses focus.  Not to say it is a terrible effort by the Stingster, but in contrast to Soul Cages or Ten Summoner's Songs it just doesn't keep its momentum.  And, as an observation, it seems that the English try repeatedly to make a country song work but it never comes close to sounding like Nashville or even Lubbock, for that matter.  Sting is no exception but he's in good company.  The Beatles (What Goes On) and The Stones (Dead Flowers) have made earnest attempts as well.  Having said that, it still works better for me than suffering through a song sung in French.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I thought love actually was a refreshing take on the typical romantic comedy.  It's funny, heartwarming without falling into typical romantic comedy fluff.  Not all of the endings were happy, some of the meetings were really unusual and some conclusions were a little unbelieveable, but it just made the story better.  And, the soundtrack is amazing.  I definitely recommend it.
0156027321|5.0|I picked this up at an airport bookstore in a desperate attempt to make the 6 hour trip go faster.  I didn't expect much, but the pickings were slim. <br /> <br />6 hours later I didn't want to get off the plane and interrupt my read.  I thought reading about a boy trying to survive for months at sea would be as dull as watching paint dry, but I was very, very wrong.  Each page was filled with something clever, insightful, or both.  The boys survival, whether you believe the story or the \\"alternative\\" offered at the end, is a miraculous tale.  Loved it!
0671449028|5.0|This book is one book we truly adore.  My son seemed magnetized to this book.  This was one of the first books I read to him at bedtime...whether nighttime or naptime.  We love this better than Goodnight Moon.  I actually can read the book to my son with my eyes close after a couple of readings.  The rhyming text flows so smoothly, that makes reading so fun, easy and addicting.  I never liked reading but this hooked me to doing so daily.  I'd even whisper the repetitive texts to my son's ear, which he likes so much.  He gives me a rewarding giggle for that.  Phrases we like most are: <br /> <br />\\"The sun has set not long ago. <br />Now everybody goes below <br />To take a bath in one big tub <br />With soap all over, SCRUB-SCRUB-SCRUB!!!\\" <br /> <br />\\"They hang their towels on the wall <br />And find pajamas, big and small. <br />With some on top and some beneath, <br />They BRUSH and BRUSH and BRUSH their teeth.\\" <br /> <br />\\"And when the moon is on the rise, <br />They all go up to exercise! <br />And down once more but not so fast, <br />They're on their way to bed at last.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The day is done, They say goodnight, <br />And somebody turns off the light. <br />The moon is high. The sea is deep. <br />They ROCK and ROCK and ROCK to sleep.\\" <br /> <br />One great buy, One great treasure to keep forever in our hearts.  I highly recommend this Boynton Book. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This guy has got a killer voice, but he does it without overdoing it.  He's not trying to be Frank.   <br />Check out the duet with Nelly Furtado.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|A great improvement over its stage version. Bob Fosse creates a wonderfully surreal picture of pre-War Berlin. Dropping many of the songs (keeping only the Kit Kat Klub numbers) and dropping some of the more sentimental elements of the stage show in favor of harsher elements from Isherwood's Berlin Stories was a brilliant move. The Kit Kat Klub is one of the greatest environments in movie history. A dank and shabby club inhabitting a once glamorous space, it perfectly symbolizes a rotting Berlin at the dawn of the Nazis. Joel Grey owns the role of the Master of Ceremonies and will never be equalled. The 1998 stage revival veered far off into Rocky Horror territory,it's far too coy and self concious. Fosse, however, stays directly on target with his film. Tomorrow Belongs to Me (performed by a Nazi band and sung by a fresh faced Hitler Youth at an outdoor country-side beer garden on a picture perfect summer day) is one of the most truely frightening movie scenes of all time. Joel Grey's smirk at the end  sums it up perfectly. When Liza Minnelli sings the title song at the end, the nightclub changes from its circus like atmosphere  and becomes very austere with shafts of red and white spotlights. Its a hint of the chilling final image of the film. By all means see it.    Interestingly, the type of nightclub shown in Cabaret was not generally frequented by locals. Berlin had, at the time, gained a reputation for permissive sex (notorious for homosexuality), drugs, etc. Places like the Kit Kat Klub were very popular with tourists. In The Berlin Stories, Isherwood only mentions such a place in passing when he gives directions to a group of drunken American sailors.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|...to purchase a new edition of \\"JAWS\\" on DVD, Universal STILL cannot get the cover right!  This is a terrific film with a legion of fans who deserve better.  Why is it, the legendary original poster artwork had been utilized for all VHS, BETA and laserdisc editions, pre-2000, but suddenly Universal has chosen to erase this memorable artwork in the past five years?  Same goes for the sequel DVD releases.  I am tired of studios screwing up a good thing, it seems to be a trend with DVD.  Warner Bros. is certainly the exception to that rule, as they have been the only major studio and the most consistent in maintaining original film artwork for their releases.  Naturally, the 5 stars represented here go for the film itself, and not the packaging.
B000089CKH|5.0|Now, i'm not one of those crazies who think that this is the best cd ever.  However, i do belive that this is a cd deserving of any praise given to it.  I've recently been discovering many excellent bands, and this is the latest of them.  The best songs on the cd, in my opinion, include 'Happy Kid', 'Killians Red', and one of my absolute favorite songs that i've ever heard for just it's melancholy and emotional effect, 'Paper Boats'.  It really is a beautiful song.  I would recommend this whole cd just for that one great song, but its worth it for so much more.  I highly recommend this cd, and if you're into this, i would also recommend bands such as Snow Patrol, Death Cab For Cutie, and Modest Mouse as well.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson did an astounding job directin the Passion of the Christ. I believe that he did not do this with the intentions to make an huge profit from the movie but to illustrate the whole truth of what Jesus Christ went through when he was crucified on the Cross in Calvary. <br /> <br />And I was glad that someone realized that Jesus Christ beared alot for salvations of sins. The movie evicted emotions to the audience and made us see that Jesus went through an huge ordeal of suffering from the sins of man so that we can have a chance to be saved.  <br /> <br />And so, God and man is two different realms. Man is suffering hardship,poverty,pain,violence, hatred because of sin. Thus, God gave us his Son to Us to demonstrate to us to how we can earn our way to everlasting life.  <br /> <br />Many people think that when God comes to deliver his people he will be all happy and Glad, but I am sorry to break the news to u all, but God is coming to the earth in wrath. And blood will be shed. Man can escape from Man but Man cannot escape from God. Satan, himself, cannot rendure from God's wrath. So, I always thought that the Romans not only just beat and crucify him but Jesus went through what no ordinary or extraordinary man could never endure. <br /> <br />What people dont understand is that Satan uses man to do his task. Satan gives man wealth and power to serve his duly purpose. Ans so, yea it was under Romans power that Jesus was crucified, but it was the work of Satan. But, it was the Work of God that made it so, for the sake of his people. And thus, the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ was the final symbolistic power that Satan is soon going to be destroyed when the final days of earth comes.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah's talent really comes through on this album. All of her hard work was time well spent. Every single song is a keeper. This is her best work in years. The CD gets better with each listen. This is a welcome and formidable showing for Mariah. She puts all of her experience to good use and she pulls the album together like the pro that she is. Ultimately, she closes the deal. She doesn't give up a lot room to her competitors. The pressure is all on the other girls to keep up with her now. She's setting the pace and the standard once again. I'm grateful that someone rose to the occasion. Mariah's proven herself to be worthy of all the praise and acknowledgement that she's gotten over the years. I wish her continued success with this album.
B00005K3O4|5.0|This is by far the best clown movie ever made.  It also includes a lot of funny one-liners throughout the movie.  One of my personal favorites.  Do yourselves a fvor and rent it one night!
0399241515|5.0|This is the darkest, funniest and most exciting of the Alex Rider series. In it we find out a lot more about the secrets in the past of his family, especially his father. Lots of the questions he has from the earlier books are answered. <br />Also, in this book the reader goes much deeper into Alex's character. This makes the action much more exciting. <br />Don't worry about the ending - I've read the next book in the series which is published in Britain it's called ARK ANGEL. That one isn't as good as this one though, but you have to read it because of the cliffhanger. <br />Also, if you like this you should check out JIMMY COATES: ASSASSIN because that's a new series and it takes the adventure to another level.
B0001KZM3O|2.0|The music is to me, to far and few between. It's like listening to poetry with a little bit of background music. I can get in to it if I try but it's a real effort, almost laborious. Nothing about this cd draws me in. The lyrics are great but personally I need the floyd magic in the music. There just simply is no musical adventure to me. Dry and too plain for such magnificent musicians. Others may view this as a masterpiece. I give it 2 stars although I actually won't listen to this cd anymore.
B00020HEL6|4.0|When you think of the jazzy vocals these days, you tend to think of Diana Krall, Norah Jones and the like.  However, when you listen to Renee Olstead's current self titled album, here is another person who can fit right in with them. <BR>The album ranges from standards like an inspiring version of Summertime to the original song A Love That Will Last, that was penned by the Producer of the album, David Foster.  A duet with Peter Cincotti of Neil Sedaka's Breaking Up is Hard to Do is another highlight.  <BR>Her vocal range is quite wonderful and it will be interesting to see if Renee Olstead will continue in this style or will she continue to evolve.  That is something for all of us to look forward to in the future.
B00005B534|5.0|I must say I am very impressed with Adagio. They have everything I look for in epic Metal. They have that classical element, a good combination of guitar and keyboard solos, the singer is okay, but the drummer is really good. My favourite songs on this album are: \\"The Stringless Violin\\", \\"Forte, Stephan Lands of Sin\\", and \\"Santus Ignis\\". Overall this band is a great buy and highly recommended for fans of \\"Blind Guardian\\", \\"Kamelot\\", \\"Symphony X\\", \\"Rhapsody\\", and \\"Dragon Force\\".
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|I always look forward to seeing Sean Penn, in a movie.  This movie was boring, from beginning to end! I didn't  find the story very interesting, or anything else about  it. Sean Penn, over acted too, not like him to do so.
B00005JNTV|1.0|This sad mess reminds me of the kid in elementary school who  <br />thought stringing random obscenities together made him the BMOC.  <br />The violence wasn't offensive, just silly and impotent and without direction. I actually found the Sin City comics passable, but inferior to Miller's previous works. The film however is nothing more than pointless frames filling the gap between literal translations of panels from the books.there is no creativity or vision at work, just 126 mins of static images in motion for no reason. I see people pointing out instances of allegory and symbolism in defense of this embarassment, but these translate to little more than a desperate attempt to put tinsel on a turd. I could go on but this film has cost me $8 and two hours of my life. Learn from my poor judgement and don't bother.
B0000004V2|5.0|I tried to find a flaw in this album after listening to it so many times but, right now, I can't. I'd say Don't stop is the weakest track but even then, it's not too bad a cut. The US version is inifinitely better than the UK release as it has Fools Gold (and the full version no less) included on it.<br /><br />The Roses withered and died not long after this album, One Love being their last decent effort until 1994's Love Spreads single brought them back to life for a short period anyway.<br /><br />I was there on Glasgow Green in June 1990 to see them perform in a big top. The sound and acoustics were horrendous, the spectacle awesome. A definite inclusion in the top ten albums of all time.
1591396190|5.0|I've struggled and watched my customers struggle with figuring how to do more and more for less and less.   We focus on squeezing out a bit more margin or a bit more growth in the ever-tightening markets of blood \\"red oceans.\\" <br /> <br />Blue Ocean Strategy is a fast, fun read on the business strategy of creating a new \\"blue ocean\\" market space based on building a new value curve where factors are created, eliminated, reduced, and raised.   <br /> <br />My favorite case study was their story about [yellow tail] wines, which created new wine drinkers from people who previously drank beer or mixed drinks.   <br /> <br />The book has also given me a framework to make better sense of the success of companies like Netflix and Whole Foods. <br /> <br />The best parts for me are the charts and worksheets, which have made it easier for me to apply the authors' ideas in creating my own company's blue ocean strategy canvas. <br />
630514415X|5.0|this movie is awesome, i just saw it today, its one of my favorite basketball movies right up there with Above the Rim, Denzel is great in this one, Ray Allen is pretty good in his debut, the only part that bothers me is the end with the ball coming out of nowhere, but anyways, if you like basketball, go see this movie, its great

Read this book if you want to see the adventure that follews next. <br /> <br />
B00005Y1Z4|5.0|This album is well good. Sex Dwarf is hilarious and well funky. Should be included on more \\"best of\\" lists and that kind of silliness. They'd be less silly were it on there, obviously. I am also partial to the cut Chip on My Shoulder, normally considered a mediocre one. Ball went on to be a bit annoying in The Grid.  <br />
B0002S947K|5.0|Ray LaMontagne's debut effort Trouble sounds like Van Morrison sunk deep in collaborations with Ryan Adams and Damien Rice. His voice has a depth that stretches much more than his 31 years. This is highlighted in the opening track \\"Trouble\\" which is sheltered in a quiet tone riddled with raspy kinks that alternates between soaring sparks and subtle flirtations. The track has a unique 70's flavor that could seamlessly work alongside any of Morrison's portraits on Astral Weeks.     Trouble was the result of a short two week recording session with renowned producer Ethan Johns (Ryan Adams, the Jayhawks). Like sensitive troubadour Rice, these acoustic pieces are soaked in the universality of love's pain and longing that should assure him a swooning female following. The album is peppered with these quiet, thoughtful meditations like \\"Jolene\\" and \\"Shelter\\". It doesn't pigeonhole itself into one sound though. The closing track \\"All the Wild Horses\\" sounds like it belongs draped behind a scene in an old Western film as the camera pans its way across the dusty plain. \\"How Come\\" elevates the tempo to construct this catchy line that echoes through your head.     The album executes perfection with \\"Forever My Friend\\". It enters on a steady strum threading a compelling head swaying beat infused by light and hope. His voice just seems to fall into the contours of this rhythm to amazing effect. While LaMontagne doesn't catch fire with every track here, his talent lingers throughout. This is an exquisite taste of a great artist in the making. We can only hope LaMontagne continues to grow into the promise he has captured in every corner of Trouble.  Review first published on [...]
B00004VVNB|1.0|This movie was given to me by someone that I think alot of so I want them to find out through this website that reluctantly we can't be friends anymore. Sorry. This movie was pretty damn boring. I agreed with that one guy that wrote a bad review for this movie so bigups to him. Shame to all of you who believe that this isn't one of the more boring movie since the tenant. It has its good points...well all movies have an ending thats one. Cant remember anything else except that punk ass robot crying when his little house fell apart anyway Thats about it.<br /><br />This is for my dear friend<br /><br />Sorry sweetheart this is where you and me go our seperate ways.<br /><br />She knows who this message is meant for.<br /><br />Go buy Death Race 2000 now thats a good movie!!!!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|The line of distinguished modern female jazz vocalists is comprised with the talents of Norah Jones, Diana Krall and Cassandra Wilson. Room needs to be made for one Madeline Peyroux. Eight years have passed since Peyroux released Dreamland that fell into the adoring arms of critics and racheted up sales of 200,000 copies with zero hits and a scarcity of radio play. Then she vanished like a mirage to leave us wondering what was that fascinating flash in the dark. Careless Love has materialized in its full beauty to convince us that Peyroux wasn't simply a trick of our overzealous imaginations. <br /> <br />Peyroux's voice definitely has a breath of Billie Holliday lingering within. It's hushed, it's playful, it's fever manifested. She effortlessly moves through these songs leaving traces of her dusted on each. Her range of material keeps this collection fresh. She turns down the lights to explore the hollowness of Elliott Smith's \\"Between the Bars\\". She skips along in a quaint innocence over Bob Dylan's \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go.\\" She turns Hank William's country ballad \\"Weary Blues\\" into a smoky blues flavored melody complete with blunted trumpets and quivering pianos. She opens up the musical timeline like a cookie jar to snack among the delectable thoughts scattered haphazardly along the way. The opening track Leonard Cohen's \\"Dance Me to the End of Love\\" is an intricate waltz through the streets of Paris at night. The lights dance in their release, the street stains from the day are covered in a dense black and windows flash of tantalizing pastries. Every sense is aflame. She coaxes perfection from \\"I'll Look Around.\\" Originally a song performed by Billie Holliday, Peyroux wraps herself in this piece like a soft blanket. Her voice sits quiet propped up underneath her longing that searches for an end to the empty days of a deserted love. Subtle rays of hope poke their way through in her vocal inflections. It slowly infects every part of you.  <br/> <br />Peyroux is shockingly good in her flawless execution of these classic numbers. She displays an unyielding talent softly searching the corners of its potential. The prospect that we have yet seen the full journey she's taking us on is a fascinating thought. Let's hope the demons fame has fanned in the past don't keep this chanteuse quiet for another eight years.  <br />Review first published on [...]
B00005JM2I|5.0|i love his review on this movie and i too love this movie. everything he said, i agree with him. thanks for giving me the best laugh this morning. but as for this movie, it's one of my favorites because of the set design. i work for an architechual design firm and i kind of match the message of this film to the business here. very interesting concept. does architects design buildings for the interest of mankind or for self pleasure. something to think about when you visit the Guggenheim or the Sydney Opera house or the Eifel Tower. makes you wonder.
B0007TKNL0|2.0|I'm slightly unusual here, because everyone here seems to have seen the play. I haven't; but the novel is one of my favourite stories. Ok, before anyone thinks 'Oh, she just didn't like it 'cos it was too different from the book', well, yes, BUT, I was all prepared to see a different plot line, and like it anyway.<br /><br />Well. I tried really hard, believe me, but I just couldn't get into it at all. The first scene was amazing, and brillant; the song was shiveringly great and I really thought they'd captured the atmosphere of the novel, but from there on in it just got worse. I have to say, I almost totally agree with the reviewer ''Katie \\"sporkgoddess\\"''. Why?<br /><br />For one thing, the acting was really bad. Emmy Rossum, as Christine, just wandered from scene to scene with a dazed, sheep-like expression on her face (Plenty other reviewers have said this too, so it's not just me), Gerard Butler as the Phantom kept doing this really annoying thing with his cloak, like a fake overblown 'dramatic' swirl, which was actually cringe-worthy, and Patrick Wilson as Raoul was the most moany, unsymphathetic character ever. (Yes, he is a bit like that in the book, but because it's written kinda from his point of view, we can forgive him) I agree with whoever said they wanted the Phantom just to kill him and be done with it. The managers in the book (I know, I'm sorry, but this really irritated me!) are slightly stupid and a bit greedy, but serious charcters; in the film they are just comically unfunny relief. The only one I had any sympathy for was Minnie Driver, who was slightly overblown, but believe me, not as much as everyone else.<br /><br />And the singing! Right, I have to differ from everyone else here when I say that I thought the singing itself was quite good; but there was just to much of it! (I mean, when the managers start singing 'Oh, I got a note from the Phantom, la la laaaaa' 'Oh! Yes! So did I, what sh-aaa-l we do?!' it just gets stupid and irritating. I don't know; it might just work in the theater play, but it definitly doesn't on film.)<br /><br />And, yes, I'm afraid the film just wandered too far from the book - eg, why did they make up a fake past for Erik? It completely changed his character, because he's supposed to be an evil GENIUS, and to have helped design the Opera House. Plus, the sword fight was really annoying and unnecessary. But the thing that got me most, right, the thing that really made me want to write this review, was Webber's cheek in writing songs for Don Juan Triumphant. THE AUTHOR HIMSELF did not dare to do that; he simply described it as magnificent, ect, then left it to our imaginations. It certainly was not a cheesy sing-along bunch of songs ... it was much more dark and dramatic than that. That having been said, I did like the other songs, I just thought they should have replaced unnessessary singing with dialogue, then the really important songs would have stood out better.<br /><br />Lastly, the film was not dark, or scary enough, in my opinion. After all, it was originally meant to be a horror story - but most of the way through (from the reviews I've read here, anyway) the audience was rooting enterily for Erik! If they had stuck in the proper torture room, and let the audience hear Raoul's own thoughts about Christine, or maybe if Christine herself had been more credible, then I think the film as a whole would have been more interesting.<br /><br />Well, I still give it two stars, because it was nice to look at, and the rest of the songs were quite good - I DID like 'Phantom of the opera', but I think this film could have been so much better. In fact, it's put me off seeing the play, because if it's as annoying and over-the-top as this, I won't like it. Was the film really that true to the play? Please, everyone here who liked the film, can you do yourself a big favour and read the book? You won't be disappointed, I promise you!tating.

B0007GAERG|1.0|All of the songs here are from 90's and 80's genre. The vocals are good but there is a little \\"filler\\" in each song. I was very disaapointed and, I wasted my money.
B000005RFM|1.0|THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE CASTLE RELEASE; NOT THE WARNER BROS(although I mention the WB release).  (You can see that Amazon has applied all 165 - at this point - reviews to various releases.)    You'd think after all the effort Castle put into the packaging (which is extraordinary), that SOMEONE at Castle would have bothered to LISTEN to their final product.  They cut a note off of the end of \\"Hole in the Sky\\".  After the split-sec pause due to the hardware changing tracks, you hear it at the beginning of \\"Don't Start (Too Late)\\".  Subsequently, they did the same to the end of \\"Don't Start ...\\" and the beginning of \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" which really KILLS the cool effect of the contrast-rich and sudden-changing medley on the original Analog recordings.  They should have either put in the additional effort or just made the first 3 songs one track to preserve the effect.  VERY SLOPPY!    As for remastering from the original ... all I can say is the songs sound the same in quality as older releases.  It seems that all you get is:  same quality as before, original order of songs from the UK release (\\"The Writ\\" & \\"Am I Going Insane\\" swapped), and 3 or 4 more seconds of screaming at the end of \\"Am I Going ...\\" (which doesn't add any value to the song).    Bottom Line?  If you want a decoration, buy this.  If the music is more important to you, save some cash and buy the Warner Bros. release.  I'm going to recut the tracks on my PC, burn a new CD, and hang this one on the wall or something.
B00004Y6NM|5.0|BEHIND THE SUN is yet another great Eric Clapton CD, and perhaps the most experimental of his career, taking him into the realm of guitar synthesizers and (gasp!) progressive rock. Unfortunately, some executives at Warner Brothers, still reeling from the failure of MONEY AND CIGARETTES, were not happy with such risk-taking, and insisted that he go back into the studio, and record three new, more commercial songs, one of which, \\"Forever Man\\", became the album's only Top 40 hit. Despite the circumstances under which it was recorded, it's still very good, even if it's not quite up to the level of 461 OCEAN BOULEVARD, his later Polydor work, or MONEY AND CIGARETTES.
B00006JLX4|5.0|...I guarantee it. I got into Pavement kind of by accident. I ordered this album from my local library just on a whim (I'd listened to Amazon.com samples and was not impressed) to see what if I liked it up close and the real cd. This instantly became one of my fav albums and made Pavement/Malkmus a big part of my life. For me, Pavement is the kind of band you get into \\"phases\\" for and leave alone for a while. Malkmus' lyrics are cryptic to the point of inscrutable and despite the fact that this guy writes completely indecipherable lyrics for the most part, he still has a huge following, so what does that tell you? I know most Pavement fans consider \\"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain\\" to be their best, but I actually prefer this to CR, CR. Every song is amazing and like I said, if you are new to this group and get this album, be prepared to become obsessed and fall in love.
B00028HBKM|2.0|The movie itself is really good.  Mel Gibson is a very talented film maker.  I just wish that it had been more Biblically accurate.  There is a whole lot of conjecture, and I'm also tired of seeing Mary Magdalene portrayed as a whore.  There is no Biblical evidence of her being a whore.  Also, I know he's catholic, but enough already.  There is so much catholic ledgend in this movie, that this Christian was really bugged by it.  To his merit, I enjoyed the flashback sequences that he provides; probably during Jesus' last hours, he did reflect back on his ministry.  It's incredibly graphic, so either wait for the cut version to come out (some of the violent scenes are reduced), fast forward through it (like I did), or leave the room during those parts.  Although cinema pales in the face of reality, sometimes too much violence numbs or repulses us (I think the latter is some of what Gibson wanted).  Another good Jesus movie would be the Gospel of John.  This one, view if you want, but be forewarned about the accuracy and violence aspects.
B00009V7ON|3.0|Okay what is our obesseion with being deserted on a tropical island that makes human-beings write books, make movies, and now even television shows about it? I suppose it's that we wonder what life would be like if everything we need to survive is taking away.<br /><br />This movie starts out giving us a portrait of Chuck Nolan(Tom Hanks) the Fed-Ex worker who lives and dies by the clock. Chuck appears to be arrogant, smart mouthed, and fast on his feet. The one real good thing in Chuck's life is his girlfriend Kelly(Helen Hunt) who he has been in a long relationship. Well on Christmas Eve everything changes for Chuck- work driven he decides to go on a buisness trip over the up coming Holiday him and Kelly exchanging Christmas gifts in the car. When turbulance strikes the plane, the plane goes down crashing somewhere near the Cook Island- Hanks is suddenly alone being the only survior he learns to cope and make use of FedEx packages that wash ashore from the crash. At this point of desertion on the island you hear little to no dialouge which gives you a sense of solitude that Hanks is feeling except when he talks to a ball that he calls \\"Wilson\\" giving you the sense that he is craving for social interaction. Hanks struggles with difficult tasks from fishing to making fire. He is helpless. Until four years later, you see a much thinner Hanks, with a long beard, who has learned how to cope with what must be done on the island. Suddenly when a small piece of the wrekage washes ashore- Chuck makes the decision to use it as a sail and go out into the waters risk his life, rather stay on the island waiting to die. When Chuck is saved, by a passing ship he is returned a world he barely remembers anything about, except for Kelly- who is now married and has a child. Nolan's one reason for living on the island was- Kelly now, with that hope smashed he has to learn to survie the heartbreak to go on.<br /><br />Tom Hanks gives a good performance as Nolan but, not his absolute best. Helen Hunt also does a good job as Kelly but, her role in \\"Pay It Forward\\" in my opinon was her best performance ever. With little to no dialogue in most of the movie, I couldn't help but feel that desertion for Hanks and even I found myself looking upon the ball \\"Wilson\\" that he talks to a good friend. This movie made me think about all the things I do have in my life and am grateful for. Who wouldn't want to be stuck on a deserted island with Hanks?<br /><br />I also like the message contained in the movie when Hanks said \\"Tomorrow the sun will rise and who knows what the tide will drag in,\\" after he loses Kelly, he goes out to Texas so he can return a package he found on the island- the only one he couldn't open (for the fact it had this gorgeous butterfly painted on it) when, a woman stops to help him as he looks lost-telling him which roads lead to where. Suddenly, as she drives off Hanks sees a butterfly painted on the back of her truck- He smiles looking off as she drives off into the distance. I couldn't help but, think that is something the tide dragged in for Nolan and  that the two in the end ended up together.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, but it's the kind of movie that will only touch you once. This is a movie I'd rent but, not buy.lute best. Helen Hunt also does a good job as Kelly but, her role in \\"Pay It Forward\\" in my opinon was her best performance ever.

B0007OCG4W|2.0|This film lacks just about everything except great actors. It is worth seeing, maybe once at best. <br /> <br />Anna (Julia Roberts) is a married photographer who meets her husband, Larry (Clive Owen) through a twist of fate porno site set up. She crosses paths with a writer, Dan (Jude Law) when she photographs him for his book cover but Dan is somehow involved with a young stripper/waitress (Natalie Portman). Inevitably when lies are told lives are fowled up and these characters really make a mess of things.  <br /> <br />With a great director like Mike Nichols at the helm of this movie one would think it would all work. However I felt it lacked depth of any kind. The characters are cruel and passionless despite being obsessed with sex 24 hours a day. Clive Owen is downright creepy in his role as a doctor who frequents porn sites for a thrill.....is he such a crappy doctor that he has that much time to kill? Julia Robert's character is more like his possession than a wife and her role seems to have no purpose whatsoever. It is never explained why a seemingly beautiful and successful woman would agree to marry a freak who believes he met her in a porno site chat room....any self-respecting woman would question that even if he were a doctor with a Mercedes! So there is definitely something deeper in there but it is never made clear and soon becomes absolutely frustrating. Jude Law's role is jealous and obsessive and would have made sense had he treated Portman's character with a bit more respect. And finally Portman is a bit over her naive head here pretending to be raw and racy while projecting far too much fear, she is a great actor but this role took something away from her.  <br /> <br />I'm not sure exactly where this film really fails, the writing, the directing or the subject matter. I think it would have worked had more attention been paid to the reasoning behind the flawed characters and their decision making processes. They should have stayed closer to a good psychiatrist couch rather than their bedrooms if you ask me. This movie is so far from close it isn't even near!    <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have not taken it out of my Cd player since I've bought it. Although some of the tracks are a little unrealistically sung. But it will just make more people try harder to sing with her. \\"We belong together\\" will become a great song of the year. Shake it off is a great song for all those guys that think they can still have you, but you got to learn to shake them off. And more wonderful songs after those. Highly recommended, go buy it now if you didn't already
B0002YLC24|2.0|This was actually a very interesting movie. The whole thing takes place in real time during a stroll, cup of coffee, short boat ride and short car ride through Paris. The couple does not stop talking once. Basically they are describing things that another director with a larger budget might have chosen to dramatize. Not that I don't like witty repertoire, but this was ridiculous. I mean it's clever enough, it is exactly the kind of conversation you might have if catching up with a one-night stand after 9 years. Though of course the \\"man\\" (Hawke) keeps somehow maneuvering the conversation back to jokes about getting the \\"woman\\" (Delpy) into the sack, which I found to be so juvenile. They skirt around touchy subjects like politics and religion and just when you think the conversation is going to turn into a debate they laugh and all is well (oh aren't they so cute). But I guess in real life that is what you would do with an acquaintance. The whole time we were watching we wondered what was going to happen. Something was going to happen. Nothing really does that isn't obvious. I might call this review a spoiler -- though there is really nothing to spoil because nothing happens (and I don't mean nothing like Seinfeld's nothing which is really something, I mean NOTHING, just pleasant conversation). Don't get me wrong: the dialogue is very good. Ethan Hawke tends to pick very poetic touching movies. And any other night this would have made a good coffeehouse flick, but we were hoping for something with a little more meat. It was this or \\"Defending Your Life\\" and I really regret the decision we made!  :)  Best part of the movie: when Delpy sings the pretty waltz toward the end. Just lovely.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is a movie based on my most favorite Director of all time, Hayao Miyazaki. I was at Blockbuster ( a movie rental store for those who might not know ) and I seen this movie. The name kind of got me to wanna go see what it was about... because of it, I ended up renting it for that time. I was glued to the TV screen until the movie was over! Spirited Away is truly a family movie, a movie that everyone will enjoy! Its filled with magical things, and beauitful artwork as you will find with any Miyazaki movie from what I've seen. If you really want a wonderful movie, pretty much appropriate for the whole family, rent or buy this movie! It is well worth it!!!
B0000028M7|5.0|Alice In Chains sophomore album \\"Dirt,\\" stands as the band's most popular and most critically acclaimed album. \\"Dirt\\" stands alongside Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" and Soundgarden's \\"Badmoterfinger\\" as an essential album of the grunge era. Much like \\"Ten\\" \\"Badmoterfinger\\" and \\"Nevermind,\\" \\"Dirt\\" was an album that many inferior bands, i.e., Godsmack, borrowed from.  Although the Seattle group was categorized as a grunge band, they were also distinctly a metal band, although they did write a fair amount of acoustic material.<br /><br />\\"Dirt\\" is one of the most powerful, genuinely harrowing, intense, depressing albums of all-time. Some singers are very contrived and put on an act, a fake pain or rage (like Gavin Rosdale or Fred Durst). But with \\"Dirt,\\" when you listen to these songs, you can hear the pain in singer Layne Staley's voice. These songs were written by someone who was at absolute rock bottom. The themes of the album-drug addiction, loss, depression, regret, nihilism, hopelessness, come across as so real that this album is somewhat difficult to listen to. What makes this album especially sad is the knowledge that Staley would eventually succumb to his drug addiction.<br /><br />Although the nature of this album and its frontman is heartbreaking, there is no denying the greatness of the band and these songs. Layne Staley and guitarist Jerry Cantrell were one of the best, if not best, guitar/singer teams from the 90s. The 60s had Jagger/Richards, the 70s had Perry/Tyler, the 80s had Slash/Rose, and the 90s had Staley/Cantrell.<br /><br />Staley's voice is eerie, powerful, and hauntingly beautiful. It's not so much the dark lyrics that make these songs so powerful, it's the way Staley delivers them. These songs sound lived in.<br /><br />Cantrell's playing on this album is simply terrific. Each song has a terrific, intense riff, and one or two killer solos. These songs are instantly catchy and memorable. The songs combined the sludgy guitars and riffs of Black Sabbath, and the beauty and melody of the Beatles. Bassist Mike Starr and Drummer Sean Kinney provided an exciting and dynamic rhythm section.<br /><br />Although there were several singles and radio staples from this album, I feel that this album is best appreciated when listened to as a whole. There isn't any filler and each song is essential to the flow and cohesiveness of the album. The album starts out with \\"Them Bones,\\" and the listener is immediately thrown into the hell that Staley is feeling. \\"Damn that River\\" is another powerful, no-holds-bar up-tempo metal song. \\"Rain When I Die,\\" is more mid-tempo, but just as intense.  \\"Down in a Hole,\\" one of the album's  slower songs, sounds like a man who has been struggling personal demons in vain, and has finally given up all hope of ever being free. The somewhat offbeat \\"Sickman\\" has an almost insane feel. The soft-spoken \\"Rooster\\" is an ode to Cantrell's father, and tells the story of his embittered return home from the Vietnam War. \\"Rooster\\" is one of the finest radio staples from the 1990s. \\"Junkhead\\" tells the story of the depths that drugs take the user. It shows how everything becomes irrelevant once the user is addicted. The sludgy title track \\"Dirt\\" tells how despondent Staley feels. This is probably one of the bleakest songs ever recorded. \\"God Smack\\"  (the title of which inspired the third-rate rip-off) rocks hard and is what the band Godsmack could only dream of creating. \\"Iron Gland\\" is a non-song that helps break the pace and gives the listener a little reprieve from the very intense CD.  The album comes back and closes with the mid-tempo \\"Hate to Feel\\", the infectious \\"Angry Chair,\\" and the radio staple \\"Would?\\"<br /><br />Despite the fact that most of these songs are  hard-rockers, none sound similar and the album never gets monotonous. Each song is carefully crafted and meticulously delivered.<br /><br />Even though \\"Dirt\\" doesn't get the recognition and praise as some of its contemporaries, it is easily just as inflectional and as well constructed. And although many inferior bands tried to copy the Alice In Chains sound, there was only one Alice In Chains. \\"Dirt\\" is a masterpiece and sounds as fresh and invigorating today as it did in 1992. It is an essential album from the early 90s and is a cornerstone to a modern rock collection.as well constructed.

B00003CXBK|2.0|Princess Mononoke is a really popular movie... just see all the positive reviews about it! I rented this movie, then recieved it as a gift from a friend. The story itself is good... although, I was not very impressed and for me, it \\"dragged\\" alot. It is kinda scary for the younger ones I would say... and for me, it wasn't that great at all like I said. I rather not give the story away so I won't say to much but... I would not spend my money on it. I would buy it if I were you first... as with any movie, that is how personally I do it.
B000089RVX|5.0|i don't know about the rest of america, but (no offense to the singers) i am tired of the poppy-lets-go-ride-a-magic-carpet voices that america's teen singers are portraying and endorsing. When I heard this bands first released single \\"Bring Me To Life\\" on FUSEtv I was slightly amazed and intrigued by Amy Lee's apparent passion and talent for the vocals. Her band as well, surprised me by there enormous talent and love for the music. While others might say in the present days they have \\"sold out\\" i could not disagree more with them. If they want to see a REAL sellout I would love to direct them to Mrs. Spears and Ms. Aquilera. I am very sorry if this offends any of todays artists but I am using my right to an opion. Now let me critique the playlist: <br /> <br />Going Under: An amazing ballad, full of real emotion and haunting lyrics. One of my favorite on the cd. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Bring Me To Life: The first single, tedious at times, but a great reminder of their beginning 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Everybody's Fool: My favorite song on the cd. The lyrics are truthful and do not over-exagerate in the least. Amy's range is amazing and the band does an amazing job 5/5 <br /> <br />My Immortal: Loved it when it was first released, now I am a bit tired of it. I highly recommend the new version on their new cd \\"Anywhere But Home\\" 3/5 <br /> <br />Haunted: This song is quite odd to me, but nonetheless a nice song 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Tourniquet: I believe Christians around the world will agree that this song spoke to them. I remember lying on my bed, my iPod blaring this song and I looked up and felt a total peace.. Amy's range in this song is mind boggling 4/5 <br /> <br />Imaginary: my least favorite song 2/5 <br /> <br />Taking Over Me: this is the second best song on the album! The drums are amazing as is the bass solo. They lyrics ring true to any one in a broken relationship. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Hello: Amys voice is positively haunting in this song, made the hairs on my backstand straight up. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />My Last Breath: This song is a pretty average song. Very Middle of the road. But i like it nonetheless. 3.8/5 <br /> <br />Whisper: I honestly could not recognize many of Amy's lyrics which was very dissapointing but I loved the rhythm and tempo. What Amy's clarity was lacking the band made up for. 3.8/5 <br /> <br />All in All this is simply the best cd I have purchased in a long while. I highly recommend if you like even one song your invest in the whole album. VERY worth your while. Thank you for your time.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I can't conceive why there are negative reviews on this fabulous film version of the marvelous stage play!  Having seen the play several times and the B&W movie version I have to say that this movie takes the best of all and excels in every way!!!  It's such a shame that the 'snobbery' exists that might prevent the public from enjoying this truly magnificent film!  It is a work of 'art' and the many times I've seen it the theater has been full of people who are 'spellbound' - consistently.  The credit goes largely to the heartfelt performance of Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum.  Whatever Mr. Butler was paid it was not enough - considering the energy he put into the role.  This film will be lasting and his contribution is vast - a heartfelt 'BRAVISSIMO' for his performance!
B000002LRX|5.0|Eric James Cooper can go f*** himself. FNM is an amazing band. Mike Patton is a genious! He has amazing vocal talents. I don't see how anyone can hate this band. This is one of the most original albums I've heard, only to be ripped-off by cappy nu-metal bands. This album also contains good guitar riffs from Jim Martin, EXELLENT basslines from Bily Gould, cool drumming from Mike Bordin, and cool keyboard sounds from Roddy Bottum. This is my personal favorite FNM record, and the second one I've heard (my first being The Real Thing). The starts with Land of Sunshine, it is one of my favorites on this album. The second song, Caffiene, is a great, heavy song. The next track, Midlife Crisis, is my favorite song on this album, making it my favorite FNM song ever! Other great songs include RV, Malpractice, and Jizzlobber. All of the songs rules, but the above mentioned are my favorites. I've heard rumors of possible FNM reunion tour next year. I sure hope the rumors are real, I was 6 when they broke up, so I missed out on a lot. If you like funk metal (FNM's main style), experimental music, or just good music in general, pick up a copy of Angel Dust today.<br /><br />Ratings:<br /><br />1. Land of Sunshine 5/5<br /><br />2.

B0002S94OS|5.0|This has to be the best metal I have heard in a long time. BUY IT!!!
B00005JNTZ|5.0|Veronica Mars is easily the best show on television right now.  It's smart and sassy with intricately woven plots that keep you guessing at every turn.  The superb writing staff of VM could teach the writers of Lost and Desperate Housewives a thing or two about pacing a believable, suspenseful long-term mystery arc, and they have more respect for the intelligence of their viewers than most other shows put together.  The ensemble cast is unparalleled for talent and chemistry, and Kristen Bell and Jason Dohring are two of the best actors I've seen on television in a long, long time.   <br /> <br />No matter what anyone says, smart television is not dead: it's just moved to Mars.  If you're not watching this show, you're missing out, and it's a must-have for DVD.
B0001D0FTW|5.0|For one who has only been listening to power metal for about 6 months, starting with DragonForce, these guys definatly rock hardcore! Edguy has a way of having great melodies with their music, while indeed the lead singer has an extremly high range, and yet, with the melody and the continuous pounding of the sixteenth note bass pedals on the drum set for all those who like rock you can't help but just sit and listen to them. I for one have only heard this band for about a month, and after comparing their intonation with other power medal bands, these guys take the cake with increadable ease! Their choruses can never get boreing. You can just sit and listen to them for the longest amount of time. <br /> <br />The first track \\"Mysteria\\" kicks this album off with shall I say INCREADABLE AWSOMENESS!!! The melodies and rythums are just too cool to ignore, no matter what kind of music you listen to. <br /> <br />Not only do I recommend this album I recommend ANY Edguy album. They are all good, and should be listened to if you love the European style of rock, or just love rock!!
B00003CXAR|5.0|JAWS is one of those movies that really strikes the viewers as classic. It is one of those movies that you will remember long after you watch it. <br /> <br />It is a horror thriller movie...in other words, action with a bit of fright. The scenes are really (well, its really a matter of opinion) really tense and, at the least, suspenseful. Such as the classic 'shark attack' music. <br /> <br />I would strongly recommend this movie if you like the whole action-thriller genre.
B0000C8AVM|4.0|the two opening songs are my favorite Bob Dylan songs ever, period.  I am not saying, by giving this a four star review, that this is a bad or mediocre album;  I do enjoy all of the songs.   <br />However, Bob Dylan has never really been my cup of tea; he is so taken up with his \\"poetry,\\" and what has any of it really changed, you know?  The world isn't going to stop being a bad place just because Bob Dylan wants it to!  Yes, he is very important to rock music and folk music, and people analyze his stuff all the time, but the man seems a little crazy and full of himself.  that is probably what happens when little people start worshipping you and quoting your words at every turn.  I mean, the man thinks he understands all these things, and that there is all this philosophy that he \\"gets.\\"  I find this kind of poetic stuff to be quite trite and annoying in the grand scheme of things.  If he let go of his pretensions, I would enjoy the music a lot more.  I have this same kind of problem with the Beatles, and I wish that people would stop giving hero worship to music artists.  contrary to what mr Dylan said, music is not hard work, and it pays an obscene amount of money that is overall not deserved. <br />That said, this is a good album.  It is enjoyable, and mostly focused on people and relationships.  with the exception of \\"buckets of rain,\\" the last half is fairly lackluster.  I know a lot of people really like Dylan, and if you are one of those people, you need this album.
6305252521|5.0|The Trueman Show is truly one of the most unique and original movies I have ever seen. It stars Jim Carrey, and I think he fits his role as this character perfectly. Jim Carrey has long since been one of my favorite actors, but for some reason, this movie just screams classic! <br /> <br />It is produced very well and believeable. The acting in itself is great because part of the time the actors are simply acting as if they're acting. I know it gets confusing, but that's how it is. <br /> <br />Basically, there's this guy who's lived his whole live in this 'fake' world. Everything around him is basically a movie set. The whole city. He begins to notice over time, and he tries to leave, but cant'. I wouldn't ruin it for you, but that's the basic premise. <br /> <br />This movie is not action/adventure or horror or any related genre. A very general movie, but I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it.
B000002ADT|5.0|you may not even notice how good this album is, but believe me, you will.  The remastered version makes a classic album even better, making this the definitive Miles Davis release.  the musical permutations are stunning and weave around you as you listen, and they seem to go on and on, making you pay attention.  if you are worried that it is a muzak sound, it is nothing close.  Miles and company are not looking to lightly entertain you, they are creating something much greater and cooler.  Everyone needs to have this cd.  I also recommend Blue Train by John Coltrane and Time Out by the Dave Brubeck Quartet if you like this cd.  Of course, even those classics can't top this one!
B0007YVBFC|5.0|I've read alot of reviews from the magazines on this albumn and I am reminded why I don't pick my music according to others opinions because to me this albumn is the best from MC. Of course there are some tracks that I am more into than others, but overall I'm feelin the whole albumn. I've heard that she should have switched up her style, but that goes back to she started it, is keeping real and if it aint broke dont fix it. So bottom line, if you are grown, sexy and know what real music is get this albumn.
B000002AGN|5.0|the trademark of this album is the effort Dave Brubeck and company go to to deviate from established forms in jazz.  from the cover art to the insane time signatures that change repeatedly, TIme Out is a special recording that stands as a jazz classic.  This is a good companion and one of the \\"big three\\" jazz records for me, which are KInd of Blue by Miles Davis, BLue Train by John Coltrane, and this album.  of course, these 3 don't take into account the work of Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday, artists who I have yet to hear for myself (I'm getting to them eventually!).  This cd is also known for its bouncing life, which is sometimes missing from jazz in favor of darker, \\"bluer\\" overtones.  Nothing blue about this cd.  It's a classic!
B00008G9JO|5.0|I love this cd almost as much as the Stormwatch cd remaster. It has excellent songs such as Acres wild, And the mouse police never sleeps, Rover, One brown mouse and Moths. No lullaby is pretty cool also. The title track Heavy horses, Weathercock and Journeyman are the weaker songs on the cd for me, but they are good in bits. No lullaby and Heavy horses sound alot heavier and cooler in live recordings from this era. Living in these hard times and broadford bazaar are decent additions. I was surprised not to see Blues instrumental included on this cd. It is a very cool blues/fusion song from 1978 and would make my fave songs from this era. Also, A stitch in time and Beltane are two other goodies which were released on Stormwatch and Songs from the wood remasters respectively, but those songs were from 1978, so I think they should have made this cd. If those 3 songs were included, I would love it as much as Stormwatch
0393317552|5.0|I realize that none of these ideas are particularly groundbreaking (it seems obvious to me that strictly biological differences have not seperated the progress of humans) but Diamond brings the idea of geography being the main force of human change to full flower here.  This is a good book with which to begin becoming acquanted with human history, and familiar with many of the important changes brought about to create the world we live in today.  I wish the section on human expansion from Africa was longer, but there are other good books to learn about that from.  Diamond always presents an opposing argument, and gives reasons as to why it doesn't work logically.  I have had the good fortune to stumble across this terrific book, and I recommend you check it out also.
0812550706|5.0|Enders Game is extremely to the point. it made me look at my culture, the world and where humans might be going. there were very few points in the book where i even slowed down. Orson Scott Card hit it hard with this book, he doesnt always, but he did here. the characters are very real, and Ender is very believable. there are very few points in the book where Card gives away the direction of the book. It is truly painful to watch what the progression of Ender and yet it is impossible to put the book down. Card goes after the core issues of human culture, and american culture. He looks at education, morality, propaganda, honor, violence and war and human nature within voilence and war...the whole bigger domestication process. it's facinating and very painful.
B00006EXDM|5.0|this covers all their greatest stuff, and is really all you need if you aren't a hardcore fan.  I wouldn't call myself a real Rolling Stones fan, but I do enjoy the classic songs on here like \\"paint it black\\" and \\"satisfaction,\\" among others.  ideal if you are new to the band, though you have likely heard of them before (they must be the most famous band in the history of rock, no?)  yes, definetily get it.  I know that the Stones always have released mediocre live material, but the live tracks on here are extremely good, all 2 of them.  There's not that much I can say about the Stones; I like most of the music, but in general I don't dig the band that much.  If you are like me, this one is for you.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|I really didn't think I'd hear from Alan Parsons again, so this release surprised me.  While I do feel A VALID PATH is not the best work Alan has done ... by a long shot, and this work is hardly a \\"concept\\" album as we have come to expect, ANYTHING from Alan is usually far better than most of the stuff being released today.  So knowing the way I feel about Alan Parsons, let's go down the list: <br /> <br />Return to Trunguska:  Ahhhh, the best piece on this CD, especially in light of David Gilmour's (I'm sure everyone here knows Pink Floyd) outstanding guitar work.  What a pleasure this was!  Who else can make a guitar sing like that?  I was smiling all the way through this magical number.  Unfortunately, the rest of the album is not up to par to Trunguska (except perhaps Chomolungma). <br /> <br />More Lost Without You:  Alas, I found this piece a bit annoying and usually skip over it (although I was told to give it a few more plays).  At least it wasn't as annoying as \\"Call Up\\" from TIME MACHINE. <br /> <br />Mannagamma '04:  Why?  I give credit that its beginnings are different from the original, and even interesting (meaning, I was surprised when Mannagamma crept out from the depths), but I consider this to be filler material. <br /> <br />We Play the Game:  Reminds me of early Alan Parsons \\"Project\\", and it was nice to hear Alan actually sing again.  Funny, his voice sounded a bit like Eric Woolfson's to me.  Nice, and I'd rate it fourth best on the CD, but still, it isn't exactly noteworthy. <br /> <br />Tijuaniac:  A jazz composition.  I found it Interesting, especially with the surprising crescendo, but again, it wouldn't be copied to my \\"favorites\\" list. <br /> <br />L'Arc En Ciel:  I really enjoyed this one and rates as my third favorite on this CD.  I even thought a couple of segments sounded Pink Floydish and wondered if Gilmour was involved. <br /> <br />A Recurring Dream Within a Dream:  Why again? It didn't improve upon the original in any way, shape,or form.  Pure filler. <br /> <br />You Can Run:  Another cut I enjoyed.  Again, nothing spectacular or even original, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. <br /> <br />Chomolungma:  The second best in this collection.  I found it impressive and it reminded me of Tusk by Fleetwood Mac. <br /> <br />There you have it.  For me one cut is a classic, one a near classic, two that I really enjoyed, two I deemed as interesting, two as filler (even though I liked one of the fillers), and one as annoying.  Normally I would give this a rating of 6 out of 10 ... or 3 stars.  But since I would not want to be without Return to Trunguska (a treasure IMO), and the fact that I'm just happy Alan hasn't fully retired, plus the fact that this CD has the usual excellent engineering behind it, I'll give this a marginal 7 out of 10, or a 4 star rating. <br /> <br />For Alan Parsons fans, A VALID PATH brings us at least the hope that more will be in the pipeline from this exceptional artist.  For those who are new to Alan Parsons, get any of their first few albums (Tales of Mystery and Imagination, I Robot, Pyramid, Turn of a Friendly Card) if you want to know what he and the \\"project\\" were really all about.  Once you do, you'll become a fan as well.
0140295569|4.0|Nick Hornby gives music and romance a philosophical spin in \\"High Fidelity,\\" the funny, rueful book about men, music, and modern love. While occasionally his lead character's \\"top five\\" lists can be a little annoying, this is a charmingly original, wry and thoughtful novel - an offbeat romance for our time.<br /><br />Rob owns a little music shop in London, which is a good thing because he is musically obsessed -- pop music, he claims, makes him fall in love. But even pop music can't heal his heart when his longtime girlfriend Laura breaks up and moves out. What's worse, Rob has no idea WHY she broke up with him, and he feels mixed feelings about losing her (he cares about her) and her musical tastes (bad).<br /><br />He immerses himself in his rickety business with his weirdo employees -- these guys alone are worth checking out the book for. He dates a folk singer. He learns that Laura is now involved with the repulsive guy upstairs. And finally, he assesses his past sex life and romances (the top five, specifically), getting a bit of insight into what Laura's problem with him might be: He's stuck in his mid-teens.<br /><br />Thirty-five is kind of old to start growing up. But like many real people, Rob learns that it's change or die -- in his case, alone and surrounded by records. \\"High Fidelity\\" is a nice blend of musical/movie memoir, love story and belated-coming-of-age tale. It's kind of geeky and pokes fun at itself, but therein lies its charm.<br /><br />Hornby writes a nice, breezy kind of prose, peppered with plenty of pop culture and musical references. Not to mention the top five lists: Top Five Episodes of Cheers. Best Side One Track Ones Of All Time. Top Five Bands or Musicians Who Will Have To Be Shot Come the Musical Revolution. At times the pop culture name-dropping gets a bit tiresome, but it mostly underlines how quirky and mildly obsessive Rob can be.<br /><br />And oh, he can be quirky. He can also be a self-centered jerk, and a bit confused and clueless to boot. Hornby's alter ego is likable for his flaws, and somehow manages to shed a little light on how men think. Good backup comes in his clerks Barry and Dick, who are just as geekily eccentric about music and lists as Rob is.<br /><br />Nick Hornby's \\"High Fidelity\\" is an excellent slice of Brit-lit -- it's quirky, wry, insightful, and a bit obsessed with good music.

B00005JNTZ|5.0|This show is one of those few that really gets you thinking.  Each episode of this season you're given little tidbits as to the whole Lily Cain mystery.. and it leaves you guessing... I absolutely love this show. It definitely isn't publicized enough, but ya know it's kinda nice to have this show that you think is great and then you're able to tell all your friends about it! I've definitely been trying to recruit, recruit, recruit!! lol
B00000GAIW|5.0|Oh, boy! To write an interview about J.T. Aqualung - it ain't easy task, is it? Most probably this is one of the most mentioned records ever released. This music is very, very, very specific and so many, many over-competent people have expressed their views on it. To say something stupid and unfit here must easily be taken as killing oneself in the eyes of J.T. followers (at least). I would still run a risk in telling that: <br /> <br />Aqualung is the only (of GREAT) J.T.'s irreplaceable and indispensable album! To prove that one can assume/imagine there is no any other (one) J.T. album and it will not be difficult to find some other J.T. album to be compared to, to fill the gap.  <br /> <br />If one had never ever heard Aqualung, which of J.T. albums would you recommend to be listened to instead to get the idea of Aqualung? Which one? Pondering over? - Just drop it. One cannot find an answer if there is no answer. <br /> <br />If you were careful enough, you must have noticed me using the word GREAT. If one proves J.T. first \\"This was\\" 1968 being GREAT - I will give up and you can easily disregard the above written. If no, I still think I haven't killed myself in writing this review. <br /> <br />Bottom line: The classic, indispensable, irreplaceable Jethro Tull album. If you haven't listened to this CD, you haven't listened to Jethro Tull.
B0006HXXBA|4.0|Growing up in the 80's during the heyday of thrash I somehow skipped over this band. At the time I was listening to bands such as Slayer, Megadeth, Exodus, Testament, Anthrax, Nuclear Assault, etc. Due to the fact that many bands today simply don't interest me I decided to look into Kreator since they were compared to some of the bands I mentioned. Taking some advice from the reviewers I purchased this cd and I must say I haven't been let down. This cd kicks major ass, start to finish. I hear a lot of Slayer (ie. Reign In Blood) riffs in the music. Now some of you may think it's just a rehash of old thrash riffs and to be honest it is. But, with all the whinning that goes on these days with people demanding bands to put out material that compares to their classic work it's not a bad thing. In fact this cd sounds classic and new at the same time. Each song feeds off the other making it flow perfectly. The musicianship is excellent, the lyrics are classic thrash, political and brutal, and the vocals fit in well. I am very pleased that some of these classic thrash bands are putting out music that made them great in the first place, another that comes to mind is Exodus, with Tempo of the damned. I will certainly check out some of Kreator's other works. All the songs are great.
B00070DK1E|4.0|Of all the Jethro Tull albums, this is perhaps the most difficult for me personally to review. I won't even bother to bore you with the story behind this album winning the Grammy; let's talk about the music.<br /><br />I almost get the feeling that two different bands were playing on this album: the progressive, maturing, introspective and somewhat experimental Jethro Tull that would become more prevalent in the 1990's, and another band called Jethro Tull - a band caught in a mid life crisis and desperately trying to recapture the heady days of past glory. What we got was an album that worked wonderfully on some levels, yet failed on others. The album starts with an upbeat pile driver of a song, STEEL MONKEY. To me, this song was a poor attempt to find a top 40 hit and a younger audience. FARM ON THE FREEWAY got a respectable amount of airplay and is a fairly good song. JUMP START was another song that was never a favorite of mine, but it became very popular on tour, with the roadies actually jumping out and participating in the performance.<br /><br />There are two really great songs on this album. The first is SAID SHE WAS A DANCER, which introduced a new and introspective direction for Ian and the band. The other; BUDAPEST, has become one of the cornerstones of the Tull repertoire. It was this song that really won the Grammy, and it may well be the finest song Ian Anderson ever wrote. If you don't already own this album, buy it just for these two wonderful songs!<br /><br />Considering the state of the band at that time, it's amazing this album ever got produced. Written and produced almost entirely alone in his home studio, this was really a labor of love for Ian, who was still struggling with his voice problems and was forced to sing in lower, more manageable keys. The ever present Martin Barre was featured more heavily than usual on many songs, and his playing is brilliant! Dave Pegg added the base lines and Doane Perry and Gerry Conway shared drumming duties.<br /><br />There is only one bonus track on this reissue, PART OF THE MACHINE. This is a largely forgettable song that didn't make the cut during production. It and DOGS IN THE MIDWINTER were not on the original vinyl album, though DOGS did make the final cut for the original CD release. In summary I have to say that the good songs are extraordinarily good, while the bad songs really drag this album down. But in the end, it's an album every Tull fan should have.duties. <br /> <br />There is only one bonus track on this reissue, PART OF THE MACHINE.

B0006IUDXA|1.0|As others have stated, there are no extras, digital remastering, etc on this DVD set. This is as bare bones as it gets. However, that is not why I give this set a low rating. The main reason I buy DVD sets of my favorite shows is to get uncut episodes. Everything in syndication has been chopped up to allow time for more commercials. So I like to purchase the DVD and watch the TV show as it originally aired. For most of my TV show sets this has been the case. However, there is missing footage from some of the episodes contained on this DVD set. The episode that is cut the most is \\"Thief of Budapest\\". There is about 27 seconds cut from the opening credits, then more than 2 minutes cut from the rest of the episode. I compared it with the version shown in Norway. The episodes air uncut over there and are 48 minutes long. Several of these episodes are 1 minute (or more) shorter than 48 minutes. I would rather they charge a few dollars more and get the uncut episodes on there.  <br /> <br />
B00005NVDF|5.0|`Play It Again, Sam', based on a stage play by Woody Alan is high among those movies one cites when you tick off the Woodman's `early, funny' movies. It should probably be noted that this is not a typical Allen movie in that he did not direct, although it is an excellent bridge, with the performances of Diane Keaton and Tony Roberts to his most famous movie, `Annie Hall' and others he did with Keaton around this time.<br /><br />Just before viewing the DVD of this movie, I watched `Meet the Fockers' and found this very recent film with its stellar cast, to be less funny and more contrived than the little classic `Play It Again, Sam'. Even hours of extras on the Fockers' DVD cannot make up for the almost total lack of rewatchability in the film.<br /><br />I have not watched `Play It Again, Sam' for some time, although I believe I have probably seen it at least three times before, yet I was still surprised at discovering new things about the movie. For starters, I found at least two pieces of business that I swear were copied directly into scenes of `Animal House'. Since `Animal House' is a great comedy that easily stands on its own merits, I don't begrudge the borrowing. Another observation I had with this movie was how much visual comedy there was going on. None of it was the kind of over the top long scenes done by W. C. Fields, but it definitely contributed a lot to the interest of the movie. A third new observation was the fact that `Play It Again, Sam' begins with a clip from the final scene of `Casablanca' and ends with the characters of `Play It Again, Sam' reenacting that same `Casablanca' scene. This fact stood out so strongly for me this time around since I just got finished seeing exactly the same device used in Allen's `Stardust Memories'. This is yet another case where `Stardust Memories' is quoting from Allen's other pictures. This really makes me wonder how many of Allen's films begin with a clip from some other movie.<br /><br />The best things about really great movies is that you can find problems with them without that activity's spoiling your appreciation of the movie. In fact, richly produced films simply add to your pleasure by offering an object of analysis and comparison with other movies. I feel absolutely no urge to analyze `Meet the Fockers' other than appreciate the performances of Hoffman and Streisand and wish DeNiro would go back to doing Marty Scorsese gangster movies.<br /><br />The name of this movie, `Play It Again, Sam', has probably contributed its share to the myth that this is a direct quote from `Casablanca'. As most know, Rick never actually says these four words together in the `Casablanca' script. This is only fitting, because the Bogart character dreamed up by the Allen character behaves like neither Humphrey Bogart nor Rick Blaine, his character in `Casablanca'. Allen's fictional Bogart is a construct of Allen's imagination, possibly based on Bogart in `The Maltese Falcon', but even Sam Spade would probably have more respect for women than the spectral trenchcoat with Bogart's name in `Play It Again, Sam'. My biggest question is whether this skewing of the Bogart persona was intentional and part of the interest of the film, or was he just molding things to fit his premise.<br /><br />While the movie is not pure Woody, it is a very important part of his body of work and an important early demonstration of how good he was with visual humor.<br /><br />Now all I have to do is figure out the reason for the business of the Allen character's sliding the two fried eggs from a plate back into a skillet. Seems to be connected in some way to his total inability to cook.about really great movies is that you can find problems with them without that activity's spoiling your appreciation of the movie.

B00005JNTZ|5.0|I don't think that I have truly known what it is to love a show until I started watching this one. Consistant and complex writing week after week, such a rare and precious thing to find on television today . These DVD's cannot come out soon enough!
B000002JSN|5.0|The best song on this cd is Kashmir and I could play it over N over again. Go out and buy it today and I'll save you some money<BR>for the next cd you buy.
B0007GAERG|5.0|First off, Mariahs' new CD is most definitely NOT one that you will like upon first listen. I sat through the whole thing expecting at least one track to hit me, the way 'Breakdown' did from the 'Butterfly' album, but there weren't any standouts. But play it at least three times and the entire CD becomes so embedded in your mind that you soon realize just how amazing it is. Every song has a hook but it takes a while for it to register. Yes, that means investing some time in this record, but considering how richly it will pay you back, I seriously recommend it. In this regard, I would compare it to Tori Amos' 'The Beekeeper' CD that was recently released. That was another record that had to be played numerous times before the sheer magic of it hit you. And when it does, you can't let go.<br /><br />Mariahs' best work remains her early days when she crafted songs like 'Hero' and 'Fantasy'. These days, even hit-maker Janet Jackson cannot churn out the singles she used to, and Mariah was wise to use almost every top urban producer around on this record. On 'Its like That' which is perhaps the weakest lyric on this CD, the production does the work. It could have been sung by anybody, but its so unusual and the pacing so right that it deservedly has acquired cult status. But the real zinger is on Track 2 'We Belong Together', which drag icon Rupaul called her most favorite song ever. And for a reason. This is the Mariah I knew and loved and it plays beautifully. A real return to form here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for every rose there is a thorn, and there are a couple of tracks here that reek of the Rent-a-Rapper syndrome. Consider that Snoop Dogg, Twista, and a host of others show up on most tracks in a 30-second interlude doing the same old 'dawg' routine we have grown so tired of. Its sad, but when you get past songs like 'Say Something', you're welcomed by the bouncy merriment that is 'Get your Number' which should be the big hit that Mariah has been waiting for. One thing about this record, even on the weaker tracks, is that the production is impeccable. The only record with such stellar production standards in recent memory is 'Afrodisiac' by Brandy. 'Mimi' has the same sense of style, but is classier and more polished. On songs like 'Circles', the old Mariah is back, soaring with her vocals.<br /><br />The US edition of this CD, which is the one I am reviewing, is great, but I am giving it only 4 stars because the foreign editions of the CD have some amazing tracks that have been left out for no reason. Theres 'Secret Love' which has such an infectious chorus, and a futuristic R&B track called 'Sprung' which would be at home on a Beyonce disc. If the local edition had these songs, including the 'Its like that' Remix, I would give it another star.<br /><br />However, 'Mimi' is so perfect the way it is, that its hard to fault. If you're looking for R&B album of the year thus far, it is hard to beat. But if you are looking at this CD as proof that Mariah has/hasn't lost it, you're missing the point. This is just some real quality music. And you'll really be glad you got it. I know its not leavin' my CD player!! The greatest compliment I could play this disc is that its one of those desert island discs, like Aguileras' 'Stripped'. It has something for everybody, and after a while you can't leave home without a copy!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />kabitat@gmail.com.

B000003TA4|5.0|I love Nevermind, the best songs are Smells Like Teen Spirit, which is one of my favorite songs of all time, In Bloom, Come<BR>As You Are, Breed, &amp; Lithium. I have also heard of Drain You.<BR>The weakest song I think is Terretorial Pissings. <BR>Buy it today and save money for the next cd you buy otherwise<BR>if you didn't like this CD, no problem.
B0002IQHZM|5.0|Let's be clear from the start: this isn't one of those \\"shadow of faded glory\\" releases from an artist past his prime, but a superb offering that easily matches the best of Donovan's work in his heyday. A smoky, jazzy ambience fills every track; the melodies are as strong & seductive as ever; and the agile, playful, yearning voice doesn't sound a day older. What especially impresses me about this collection, which is dedicated to the idea of the Bohemian worldview, is that Donovan isn't lamenting a lost past, or wondering what's become of those glowing ideals -- no, he still lives by those ideals, firmly believes in them, and presents them lovingly, without any irony or apology. No whistling past the graveyard of 60s dreams here! Those dreams are still alive & luminous for him; and any listener willing to discard cynicism may discover that they're dreams worth living. If you're not snapping your fingers to \\"Poor Man's Sunshine,\\" or nodding in agreement to lines about \\"music in the air, flowers in your hair,\\" then you're missing out on something wonderful. Most highly recommended!
B000000OSE|5.0|This is the best cd for Live and Let Die &amp; November Rain. The<BR>reason I got this cd is because November Rain had some of the best riffs I have ever heard in my life. That's what's known as<BR>best song ever! Buy UYI2 if you are very interested in this album. Great CD
B00005JNRB|4.0|This was an entertaining adventure film, refreshing with its lack of profanity, extreme violence and sexual voyuerism.  Funny in parts, stunts and whimsical circumstances, and the good guys vs the bad guys.  A good old fashioned movie, in the tone of Indiana Jones, and National Treasure.  As a lady, even I liked it.  A movie I would feel good about taking my dad to see.
B000000OSG|4.0|My favorite song on this CD is Civil War because they talk about<BR>not fighting in a war and the reason is that the music is great.<BR>Other than that I like 14 Years, Knock, Knock, Knockin' On Heaven's Door, &amp; You Could Be Mine. In my opinion, Estranged is<BR>the weakest song off the cd and is one of the saddest songs ever<BR>made. Anyway my favorite song off the Illusions is November Rain<BR>because it has some of the best riffs ever!
0140157352|4.0|I like this negotiation book because it emphasizes the win-win situation yet its system is flexible enough to deal with those who do not want to play that way.  On the other hand, I am still intrigued by the use of standards.  The authors propose that, in order to achieve some level of, shall we say \\"fairness,\\" one should resort to the use of established standards that help both parties to gain a perspective.  One example was about oil drilling rights in international waters.  There was a disagreement that polarized relatively rich nations against relatively poor nations, and only after the discovery and use of an oil drilling economics model developed at MIT did the impasse begin to melt.  However, what happens if the standard/model itself is developed with a biased opinion?  One example might be the customs used in apartheid South Africa that were clearly biased towards whites.  In summary, this book has important points (e.g. look at the interests behind the positions), but more work could be done to clarify the use of some principles.

0393057658|5.0|there was a general manager of the A's.  He had all the physical talent he needed to become a great professional baseball player, yet he was defeated by his own mind when he went up to bat.  While those around him with less physical gifts rose to greatness, he took the less-travelled road of baseball administration.  This book  starts by contrasting the man's entry into professional baseball and his entry into a new paradigm in the art of picking the right players for a professional baseball team.  It seems to be continuously answering the question: what makes a professional baseball player successful?  In this book the author notes the attributes that made the main character falter whereas his peers (e.g. Daryl Strawberry) went on to greatness.  Wonderfully entertaining book for which I made time to read every night.
B000000I0I|4.0|Mike Oldfield's music, at least in the \\"Tubular Bells\\", \\"Ommadawn\\", \\"Hergest Ridge\\" trilogy, consists of extended sonic landscapes.  While not as consistently interesting as the music of Tangerine Dream or Jean-Michel Jarre, his compositions are pleasant enough. <br /> <br />\\"Ommadawn\\" is about as good as it gets.  Part 1 is pure beauty, with smooth transitions from one musical theme to the next.  The drumming at the conclusion of part 1 is particularly interesting. <br /> <br />In part 2 it seems like Oldfield has run out of ideas, though the energy does build towards the end.  And then there is the \\"hidden\\" track - the song \\"On Horseback\\".  Short, and incredibly beautiful - and a fitting conclusion to a very good cd well worth owning.
0684833395|4.0|It is hard to know what to think after you read a book like Heller's Catch 22.  This is Heller's comical \\"masterpiece\\" in the eyes of many.  It is definitely comical, but a masterpiece?  That was a tough sell for me. <br /> <br />The story shifts time, plot, and characters in manner that is confusing.  It works well in this novel because the entire book is an ode absurdity.  The total and complete absurdity of war.  One can probe deeper into the real depth of the story underlining the humor, but ever Heller himself commented that it was little more than a dark, comic act on the stupidity of war.  He did not even intend it to be a thundering social statement, but rather a refreshing look at the irony that exists in all wars. <br /> <br />The main character of the novel is Yossarian.  He is kind of the books anti-hero, if you will.  Certainly he is the most famous.  The book is filled with ridiculous and memorable characters and they are all interconnected by Heller in a rather ingenious fashion.  No concrete plot exists, it is rather a map a random events that occur in the lives of these madmen during World War II.  There ranges everything from a quiet, gentle priest, to a psychotic whore, to rich, indignant soldiers, to ordinary a Major; to ruthless a General's and so on.  It would take too long to go into depth about every character.  Rest assured, they are drawn out with style and individuality by Heller in some of the wackiest scenes you will ever read in a novel. <br /> <br />Catch 22 is told in third person, but the majority of the focus is on Yossarian.  Yossarian has his fair share of flaws and mishaps, but he tends to be the one we sympathize and root for more than any other person.  Yet it is hard to root for, or care about anyone too deeply because it seems like you are always laughing.  You laugh even when you should be horrified, because some of the scenes are indeed horrifying, but they are downplayed so much by Heller that our reaction becomes tamperedwith.  Instead of a feeling of power, we are left with a feeling of confusion. <br /> <br />The only novel I can compare it to is Vonnegut's darker, wiser Slaughterhouse 5.  In that novel, the author was able to maintain a delicate balance between sarcasm, humor, and pain.  It was easy to see the author was hiding the pain of his experiences in the war through the dark, sarcastic humor.  That made it powerful and breathtaking, along with the humor.  In Catch 22, the sarcasm and humor exist; in fact, it is actually a funnier book.  However, the power and the pain do not shine through and the book seems like an attempt to downplay the seriousness of war. It left me confused at times with its dark, disturbing passages that should be powerful, but are not, because the book, for the most part, is usually told in a style of a comedic satire. <br /> <br />Catch 22 is a funny and original tale of World War II.  At times, the passages reach a level of total genius with witty and cutting remarks.  At times, it even makes you laugh and think deeply on how ridiculous war really is.  I admired the numerous weirdo characters Heller described.  I just didn't feel any real power or awe to it all.  It was like watching a dark comedy unfolding in front of your eyes.  You laugh, but when it is all over it is quickly forgotten.   <br /> <br />Perhaps that was the flaw for me in Catch 22.  I wish I could have taken it a little more seriously.  I think Heller goes a bit too extreme with his silliness and comedy, because when the \\"powerful\\" scenes of horror and anguish did finally come, I found myself not really caring too much, but I felt that I should have been moved in some way.  It was an awkward mix for me.  Not to say that I don't recommend Catch 22.  Many passages are genius and I love the originality.  It is definitely, for the majority of the time, a hilarious read.  There is just that one catch, and who knows, maybe the confusion I felt was just another intended Catch 22, amongmany others in the novel. <br /> <br />Grade: B+
B00028HBKM|5.0|I am not Christian. But I read bible many times and saw many movies to know the life of Jesus Christ. After thinking of Christ many times, his life and kindness influenced me a lot. Unknowingly I started keeping him in my heart always. He gives me peace, love and compassion. He shows the way of life to one and many.  <br /> <br />When I bought this DVD, I could not wait to reach home to see this outstanding breath taking depiction of the last part of his life. I loved the possible reality that has been shown and understood the human cruality/apathy very well even though I hated the strong violence in any form. But Jesus Christ's mission is truely accomplished and he is in hearts of the majority of the world. In my opinion, the life of Jesus Christ as depicted here makes more interesting and reaches more millions.
B00005JMJG|5.0|3 words to the creators of this movie: <br />  THANK YOU ! THANK YOU ! THANK YOU ! <br />   ==== love is the only answer ==== <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|First off, I thought this portion of amazon.com was to write a review of the ALBUM and not about mudslinging the ARTIST personally. Review the MUSIC, not the ARTISTS! <br /> <br />So now with that being put forefront in this review, lets get to it. THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI is one of the better albums to come out this year. No matter how big of a Mariah Fan you are, gay or straight, this album has something for everyone. <br /> <br />More of the Hip Hop and R&B that its been advertised to be, Ms Carey really lets her confidence shine in both her singing ability and the sounds of the tracks she serves up her for her latest studio release: <br /> <br />No matter how much \\"some\\" people don't want to admit it, ITS LIKE THAT has an infectious beat: one that tends to stick to you way after the song is. <br /> <br />WE BELONG TOGETHER, Mariah's latest single, is one of the many standouts in this album. Her voice and music go hand in hand, and the last note she stretches out is just perfect for the ending. <br /> <br />SHAKE IT OFF is definitely one track that many people can relate to, no matter if you are single or just recently becoming single, the message, class fully sang by Mariah, is one track that is better than many here are criticizing it to be. Its worth a FULL listen. After a while, you'll be singing it to yourself in your head or out loud. <br /> <br />MINE AGAIN keeps the mood nice and sensual. Not oversung at all and one track that can make a relationship come back together again. (Expect his song to be the \\"Lets Get Back Together\\" song your ex might give you one day) <br /> <br />SAY SOMETHIN' (featuring Snoop Dogg) was intentionally supposed to be the first single to be released from the album. Snoop and Mariah again have made a great song. And the fact that its produces by no other than Pharrell Williams (of the Neptunes) should speak volumes about what you'll be listening to <br /> <br />STAY THE NIGHT is the \\"sexy, but classy\\" song on this record in my opinion. Not much else to say about it, a few listens should make it a favorite. <br /> <br />GET YOUR NUMBER (feat. Jermaine Dupri) is \\"the guilty feel good track\\". If you don't at leats bop your head to the tune, there's something wrong. And JD does a decent job on his \\"singing\\". The beta itself is feel good time. Her \\"spoken\\" verses before the chorus are damn cool . <br /> <br />ONE AND ONLY is an underrated track in my opinion. Twista does his thing like he's been doing for a while. Mariah's \\"srap\\" as I like to call it (singing while rapping) is pretty cool to hear.  <br /> <br />CIRCLES, YOUR GIRL, and I WISH YOU KNEW have that element of a \\"live feel.\\"  These 3 songs are equally good in their own right <br /> <br />TO THE FLOOR (feat. Nelly) can be best described as the sister song of \\"get your number\\". This track can, and will, definitely get people in a dancing mood. <br /> <br />JOY RIDE could have easily been on charmbracelet, but that's not a bad thing at all <br /> <br />FLY LIKE  A BIRD is THE standout track of the album! This is the Mariah that many have come to love and enjoy. She sings this song with so much pride and feeling. Towards the end when the choir comes in is truly hair raising. <br /> <br />So all in all, after 15 years in the business, did you expect that she would put out a bad album?  Mariah definitely shows that she is truly emancipated. Confidence shining brightly in the form of her lyrics and voice and wonderful beats to back them up, The Emancipation of Mimi is one album that anyone can enjoy.  <br /> <br /> The Voice isn't back. Why? BECAUSE IT NEVER LEFT IN THE FIRST PLACE! Case Closed <br />
B00002Z88D|5.0|this album kicks ass. The symphony in the background backs up the band (or the other way around!) to provide a truly mind-blowing experience. order it. appreciate it. bow down to it.
B000002UB3|5.0|To put it simply Abbey Road is the greatest album in history.  <br />It contains some of the best melodies ever recorded. It is a must-have. <br />
B0007GAERG|3.0|Don't get me wrong.  I LOVE Mariah Carey and had great expectations for her latest CD, as according to her it was going to be a liberating album, fun and exciting.  I was expecting more of a dance album.  Or at least songs with more melodic tones as in her earlier albums be them ballads and/or dance/hip-hop.  Mariah has always had THE VOICE.  Now I want her to do an album that is reminiscent of her earlier work that really showcases her voice but also is new, fresh and exciting.
B000002TWN|5.0|Usually when an \\"artist\\" puts out a debut album, only 2 to 3 songs (at the most) are worth listening to.  This, however, does not apply to D'Angelo; he nailed it with this one.  Each song is a gem and will keep you moving.  This album is truly a classic.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|As a Priest fan from the early 80's I've attended Priest concerts, I've bought all their albums, I've worn the T-Shirts. I have Priest in my blood. At first I was very excited, but was a bit worried when I first heard they were getting back together.  What if they came back with a lackluster album that diminished thier status as Heavy Metal Gods?  I don't know if I could take that.  They didn't do that though. They returned with probably one of, if not THE best album of thier career.  Rob still has his harrowing, powerful metal god voice. The guitars are still crunchy, the bass thumping and the drums powerfull. I HIGHLY recommend this album to any true metal fan, and if you can see them in concert, GO.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah makes a little piece of her own history today having the highest debut of her career. Absolutely amazing. 404K copies and still counting. It's no mistake that this happened. It was always destiny. You can't be one of greatest singers ever and not have at least one eye-catching comeback to get people's attention. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" happened at the right place and right time. Thankfully, Mariah is taking us along on her great music journey again. Hopefully, this will be a great year for her. Congratulations, Mariah!!!
0060763280|4.0|I read the book and it is great. It help me understand lot of things about life not just about money. I have taken many seminars and read alot of help yourself books. By far this is the easiest to assimilate that even my teenager of 14 can do it. This book with his seminiar put all the puzzle pieces I had togather. The seminiar is better than the book though. It was like it was the glue for the the tid-bits of information that I have accumulated over the years but wasn't sure how to use them.  It just make so much sence. I think everyone should read it.  It is great for teens.  It helps them to understand how to get money to work for them so they can become financially free. My daughter now sees why she should do better in school.  I see more of an interest to get her homework done as never before. <br />Get that! <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|4.0|RATINGS 0-5 STARS <br /> <br />OVERALL ALBUM QUALITY <br />Vocally: 4 stars (Best vocals from Mariah in years--She uses more of her total range than she had in recent years (lower register, whisper singing, upper register belting, and whistle notes); Still not as good as the 'old' days of Emotions though--Her voice is still a bit strained and her transitions from 'half' voice to 'full' voice are choppy and broken) <br /> <br />Lyrically: 3 stars (Solid lyrical quality--consistant with the style of songs she has included on this album; Not as original in content or as meaningful as Music Box or Butterfly) <br /> <br />Production/Arrangement: 4 stars (Good variety of 70's style R&B ballads and modern hip-hop jams--Should please fans of both types of music; Unfortunetely, this album doesn't have a specific style because of that and it's hard to classify. She needs to have more cross genre songs that will attract people that don't like either of those two song styles.) <br /> <br />SONGS <br /> <br />1. It's Like That- (Hip-hop club track--Descent choice for a first single. Still it could have been better--doesn't compare with Fantasy or Honey.) <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together- (Good slower Hip Hop/R&B ballad. Very enjoyable and easy to imagine as a hit single with longevity on the radio) <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off- (A descent slower hip-hop track. Not as good as the previous song though--This is one of the album so-so filler's.) <br /> <br />4. Mine Again- (Very good classic R&B ballad--Powerful vocals and good intrumental arrangement. This is how I like to hear Mariah sing!) <br /> <br />5. Say Something- (Hip-hop collaboration with Snoop Dogg and a catchy Neptunes beat. Experimental style for Mariah--a classic fan will either love this song or hate it.) <br /> <br />6. Stay The Night- (Nice mellow R&B groove with good vocals. Sounds more like an older Mary J. Blige song though, so fans of her's should really like this one.) <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number- (Verycatchy up-tempo hip-hop dance track. I can see this as a hit single. Might have made a better opening choice than It's Like That. Jermaine Dupri provides the rap in which he sounds curiously like Nelly.) <br /> <br />8. One And Only- (Another hip-hop collaboration, this time with Twista--Reminds you of 'Breakdown' from Butterfly only not as good. This one is a filler, but a pretty good filler) <br /> <br />9. Circles- (Another classic R&B style ballad. A good song that should have been sung in a more sultry voice with a lower register--Would have made a good Anita Baker song, whistle notes notwithstanding) <br /> <br />10. Your Girl- (Mellow R&B groove that again sounds more like a good Mary J. Blige song. A casual listener may enjoy this one but a classic Mariah fan might not.) <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew- (Serious mixed feelings about this song. One one hand, it sounds fantastic. On the other hand, it's a complete ripoff of Alicia Keys \\"U Don't Know My Mame\\", lyrically and arrangement wise. The only thing that identifies it as a Mariah song is the whistle notes in it!) <br /> <br />12. To The Floor- (Yet again, another hip-hip collaberation with a Neptunes beat--this time with Nelly--the real one. Another descent filler song that is slightly more traditional than 'Say Something'.) <br /> <br />13. Joy Ride- (One of the more modern slower songs on the album. Reminds you of 'Bliss' from Rainbow. I personally can't get into this song because it's boring. But other reviewers seem to really like it, so you can judge for yourself.) <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird- (I think that most people would agree that this is the best song on the album. It's a classic 70's style R&B arrangement with powerful vocals and deeper lyrics than most of the other songs. Comparable to 'My Saving Grace' from Charmbracelet. Many people think that \\"My Saving Grace\\" was better but I actually prefer this one.) <br />
B0000025T6|5.0|This record is just amazing... Springsteen is an incredible storytelling songwriter. I love the emotion and the raw edge in his voice. Along with the sparse instrumentation, the voice and the stories just produce a dark ambience that sucks you right in. My favorite of his albums.

B000002AZ8|4.0|Vitalogy (1994.), the Pearl Jam's third studio album<br /><br />The Pearl Jam could do anything with their music in the early '90's. The hugely successful grunge band released two albums, 'Ten' and 'Vs.' which are quite simply amazing. They were very much at the centre of the Seattle grunge revolution and in my opinion one of the best, if not the best band to come out of the movement producing music of so much timeless quality. So, their 1994 release, 'Vitalogy', their third studio album had a lot to live up to in order to produce music as powerful and emotive as that on their first two albums.<br /><br />In my opinion, I think 'Vitalogy' in the wider context, is not quite at the levels that the first two albums reach. 'Vitalogy' is the Pearl Jam's last grunge album before they began to experiment and diversify on later albums when they progressed into the late 90's. Overall, the album is much darker than the two previous releases. There is some seriously powerful music on the disc which definitely strike a chord in my imagination when I listen to it. However, on the whole, it just seems to lack the cohesiveness of say 'Vs.', its predecessor. This may be due to the fact that the album contains three or so rather strange songs which break up the overall consistency of the work. I'm not saying that these tracks are throwaways or are bad (they are designed to go with the albums concept which seems to centre around mental health and related issues) but I would much rather see the Pearl Jam in their creative musical flow with every track. I can only really listen to these tracks every now and again ('Bugs', 'Pry To' and 'Stupidmop') as they are not really that listenable - I haven't given this album 5 stars for that reason, as in my opinion, a top rating album shouldn't give the listener any need to skip tracks. However, that aside, the music on the whole is really excellent and I always get a thrill listening to a lot of it. The work is definitely ambitious, the album sleeve tells you that alone (Vitalogy has a 20+ page inside cover which is like a medical journal!). Similarly, all of the band members are on the top of their game. Eddie Vedder's vocals are as powerful and growling as ever and the lyrics are strong through the album. Mike McCready and Stone Gossard jam out some great riffs on plenty of the tracks.<br /><br />The album opens up with the track 'Last Exit', short but jammed out in style with loads of howling vocals from Vedder. 'Spin the Black Circle' is an even heavier follow up, with Eddie Vedder singing about playing old records (the needle references are not to drug taking, as it is easy to presume). 'Not For You' is a classic piece of work - the opening riff gives a great feeling of anticipation to this one and it builds into a captivating track. 'Tremor Christ' has quite a dark aura to it whilst the follow up, 'Nothingman' has a really dreamy quality. 'Whipping' and 'Satans Bed', which comes later, are heavy rockers with lots of drive. 'Pry To' is a weird 1 minute track - to me it just sounds like the band were recorded practising and decided to put it  on the album, for some reason!! 'Corduroy' is a great track with a brilliant, catchy chorus. 'Bugs' is another strange one, with a kind of accordion sounding background. 'Betterman' though is another powerful track though, with plenty of heartfelt moments. 'Aye Davanita' is a bit experimental - its worth giving it a chance, its an interesting song. 'Immortality' follows this though and this is truly one of the best tracks that PJ made. This track was actually dedicated to Kurt Cobain (although it was written before he comitted suicide rather than after, as some people believe). It has a really memorable melody to it that makes it another imagination fuelling song. 'Hey Foxymophandlemama, that's me' is a weird finish. Its basically the band playing with recordings of mental patients from an asylum speaking over the top - its certainly interesting, but I would havemuch rather have seen the album closed with Immortality, it also goes on a bit long - 7 minutes!!<br /><br />So overall, 'Vitalogy' is a really powerful release from the Pearl Jam. It is certainly much darker than their previous releases and contains some truly memorable material. 11 of the tracks are great however, the other tracks are strange, even if they are part of the album's concept, sadly makes the album a bit inconsistent. Overall, it is a step down from 'Ten' and 'Vs.' (yes I keep mentioning those two as they're so great!) but it is still another excellent release from the Pearl Jam. A must buy for any fan of the band however I would advise new listeners to buy either of the first two albums or the 'rearviewmirror' best of compiliation before exploring the dark and strange corners of 'Vitalogy'.he album closed with Immortality, it also goes on a bit long - 7 minutes!!

B0007GAERG|5.0|\\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" gets better with each listen. It's hard to believe how great she really sounds. This is her best album to date. Definitely put \\"Mimi\\" on your shopping list. Mariah has some of her best ballads on this CD like: WE BELONG TOGETHER, MINE AGAIN, I WISH YOU KNEW, JOY RIDE, and FLY LIKE A BIRD. You also get great mid-tempos like: IT'S LIKE THAT, STAY THE NIGHT, GET YOUR NUMBER, and TO THE FLOOR. This is probably her most diverse collection. You get some of everything. I can already tell that I'll probably get more plays out of this CD than any of her previous. This one is just more interesting.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This album has so many individual riff rip-offs it shouldn't be considered an original work. To name a few, there is the obvious Johnny Cash \\"Ring of Fire\\" solo in \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\". There's also a David Bowie \\"Rock n Roll Suicide\\" rip in the same song. \\"Holiday\\" rips \\"The Passenger\\" by Iggy Pop. There are other Ramones, Buzzcocks, and Police rips too.  <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and buy an album from any of the bands that Green Day ripped off. Don't support this kind of crap.

B000001DYA|5.0|I still have my near mint copy of the original lp I bought back in 1968....the wildest thing is...I grew up in a small town near Joliet, IL...and these guys played our local teen club (I was there in the front row...leaning on the stage in awe)...and word was....they could be heard over the whole town....and this left a major wake.....I dont think anybody was ever the same.<br /><br />What makes this band truly incredible.....they were sheer power and adrenaline....no high tech, college trained musicians here...this is straight forward, high volume, blues based rock and roll.....if you look around the last 15 years at all the garage band wannabes...scarfing up vintage amps and guitars..trying to recreate a sound from an earlier and more musically exciting era....and thinking they created it.....whether they want to admit it or not..this was their blueprint....in their subconscious, they probably  recall their parents playing this while they crawled around in their cribs....<br /><br />Another great band of the era was Detroits FRIJID PINK...check out their 1st 2 cd's...pink cover and defrosted.....excellent representation of high energy garage rock of this 1968-69 era ...another band I saw live in 1969 and will never forget.....They are what rock n roll was all about.

B0000CNY27|4.0|This movie spawned one of the greatest movie posters of all time! A classic scene of Snake, the President and the rest of the gang running from the Duke of NY and his thugs with the severed head of the Statue of Liberty in the background. The greatest image in movie poster history!  <br /> <br />I remember the image of NYC back in the early 80s was rather scary. It wasnt a place you wanted to be walking around alone at night... and I bet this movie didnt help tourism much for NYC either! Although im my mind, the movie doesnt live up quite to the great image of the poster, it is a great cult classic all the same. The acting was a bit lazy in some spots and the action scenes seemed a little week but the movie as a whole made a big impression on the minds of many people during the Reagan 80's. Dark, Sinister, Comical, Irreverent, this movie made it's mark. If you like this mivie i'd also recommend The Warriors.

B000002IOW|4.0|Distortion is used very seldomly here, but the clean and acoustic guitar textures are so lush and complex that it is not needed to create any artifical depth...Geddy must have taken a lesson or two from Alex and as a result \\"Presto\\" is the cleanest rush album every recorded. There are very few synths, duel guitars, or clicky electronic drum noises. This album sounds natural, and very performable. The emptiness of space allows for the instruments to interweave in ways not heard since the 70s era. <br /> <br />    The lyrics are decent here. They are heart-felt, but not watered down with words like \\"feelings\\" and \\"love,\\" rather with colorful imagery, and poignant messages. The tribal rhythmed \\"scars\\" takes a journey through the speakers vivid memories, while the infamous \\"the pass\\" emphasizes with troubled teens in the shadow of death,    and unlike papa roach or korn, gives constructive advice for dealing with suicide. In \\"Red Tide\\" there is an obvious allusion to Dylan Thomas, and his most famous poem. \\"Chain Lightning\\" makes some well thought out observations as well. Not Peart's best, but miles ahead of his rock contemporaries. <br /> <br />     The biggest problem with this album is the extensive repetition of the Chorus. Ive listened to this album many times, and tracks like \\"Superconductor\\" must be skipped, because if I hear \\"Watch his every move!\\" another time, I'd probly never listen to Rush again. So be warned, like another reviewer said, many tracks wear out pretty fast. <br /> <br />     Despite those setbacks, \\"Presto\\" is Rushes best album since 1982's \\"Signals.\\" You also will not hear another album as good until 2002's \\"Vapor Trails,\\" which completely annihilates Rush's entire catalouge.  <br /> <br />     So buy this album if you like to sing along with catchy choruses, but I know most prog rock fans don't. For the rest of us, i'd say that the bass solo in \\"Show, Dont Tell\\" is worth the price of the album alone. That being only the first track, it is certainly worth the money.  <br /> <br />Standout Tracks: Show Don't Tell, Chain Lightning, The pass, Scars, Red Tide. <br /> <br />       <br /> <br />     <br />

B00005RFQ5|5.0|This is one of my favorite Prince albums. It's incredibly cinematic and creative. His voice sounds amazing and he really sounds more inspired than he has in years. The production is also fantastic. Discovering this record was one of the best music experiences I have EVER had. It was right when I was starting to explore Prince's catalogue (started listening to him in 2003). I had no idea what the record was about and the way Rainbow Children goes into Muse 2 the Pharaoh, it's beautiful. Beautiful music. There is this deep Darth Vader style voice that annoys a lot of people but to me it just adds to the cinematic quality of the record. I wish there was more music like this. My favorites are probably <br />Rainbow Children <br />Muse 2 the pharaoh <br />Everywhere <br />Everlasting now <br />Last December. <br />Even Wedding Feast is a fun little number. Joins Purple Rain and Sign of the times in my top 3 for Prince. <br />
B000001EAQ|5.0|I totally and utterly agree with the other review here (by Kooeyman). I came here to write a review about an album I've been listening to for years and its already been said! <br /> <br />I never disliked this album when it came out even though the general verdict was 'crap'. It wasn't, however, an album I played on a regular basis. I would always play 'DO YOU FEEL LOVED', 'MOFO', 'LAST NIGHT ON EARTH' and 'GONE' as though they were the U2 classics I had spent most of my music life with. It was the tracks 'STARING AT THE SUN', 'IF GOD WOULD SEND HIS ANGELS' (oh my god - worse than NUMB!) that would put me off this album. <br /> <br />Its not a techno dance album. The latter half of this album is infact heavier than most of their other work. If there is a U2 album that has been misunderstood then it has to be POP (probably something to do with the album's title - really, Erasure came up with the title before U2 - not a 'band' you want to follow I would definately say!!!) <br /> <br />Now with some perspective, I can listen to the whole album all the way through and absolutely fall into it. Its GREAT! Its better than ATYCLB (overrated in my opinion) and HTDAAB by far. <br /> <br />Then again, time may well do the same for the above 2 albums.
0802130208|5.0|The novel is based upon Jonathan Swift's epigram found in his \\"Thoughts on Various Subjects\\", which reads, \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that all the dunces are in confederacy against him.\\" The novel simply tells the story of Ignatius, a lazy, slothful, borish, rude, yet attractively humorous man, and his escapades with the common people that surround him.  <br /> <br />Read the opening few pages, and you will be very impressed not only by Toole's sophisticated diction, but by the magical scenes that he is able to create.
B00005JKC3|2.0|I am not a fan of the comic books, nor am I a fan of the CBS Hulk series that graces the pages of these reviews in comparison.  It's nothing personal: I just have not been exposed to them.  Therefore, my perspective on this film is one of an \\"outsider\\" to the series.  I'll be honest.  There were some \\"fun\\" moments in HULK.  I enjoyed the split-screens and felt that they helped deliver a \\"comic-book-feel\\" to the big screen.  Moreover, I really enjoyed the scenes in which the Hulk comes alive.  The special effects are very cool and I think we all want to see Hulk kick some butt every once in a while.<br /><br />However, there were also some \\"not so fun\\" moments.  Unfortunately, while the storyline had more interest in it than I had expected, it still suffered from a lack of good acting and the lack of a good script.  Whenever the Hulk is not rampaging on the screen, the film seems doomed to feel like a B-movie.  I enjoyed Nolte's performance, but his seriousness seems to strike an awkward chord against the ridiculous cast that supports him.  So, what is the solution?  Give us more scenes of the Hulk blowing stuff up.  That's the main interest that lies in this film and it is the only card it has to play.<br /><br />While many reviewers have attacked those of us who call for more action, their attacks have not been well played.  IF, and I do mean if, HULK would have served up an intriguing storyline, superb character development, and thrilling acting performances, I would not need the extra senseless violence.  However, SINCE the HULK has not provided us with such quality entertainment, I think it should have kept to what it knows: mindless action.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|As anyone as remotely fanatical about Daft Punk as I am can attest, Human After All is definitely a departure from Homework and Discovery.  Unlike Discovery, which featured songs with catchy and effervescent beats worthy of rotation on Top 40 radio stations, Human After All features no songs which I would consider potentially popular and trendy (save for the slim chance this album's current single, \\"Robot Rock,\\" may have).  And, unlike Homework, which was dark but at the same time playful, Human After All is as dark as night with no intentions of slipping away from its seriousness.   <br /> <br />With that said, I am still grateful for this album.  Although different, it shows Daft Punk's versatility and ability to capture all the human emotions music in general tries to do.  Heavy on guitar riffs (Take the title song) and haunting melodies (Take Make Love), this is the album I put in the CD player when pheening for a Daft Punk fix while trying to resolve the complications of life.  <br /> <br />So, give this album a try.  I guarantee simultaneous feelings of astonishment over Daft Punk's musical change and feelings of subtle thrill over Daft Punk's musical genius.
B0001XAOL6|3.0|The opening ten-minute sequence of ALI is visually and emotionally stunning: we are treated to a classic scene of Cassius Clay out training for a fight while images flash of the history and time period, all set to music.  Like other reviewers, while the film does not (and cannot) maintain the intensity and glory of this opening sequence, ALI is still a film that delivers on several levels.  First of all, I believe the acting deserves special notice.  Will Smith outdoes himself in this film and proved to me, once again, that he has more talent than I give him credit for.  His performance as the film's protagonist is moving and charged.  Smith has mastered \\"the voice\\" and continues to assault the camera and those around him with its dangerous ammunition.  On top of Smith's performance, the entire cast seems to be on fire in this film.  Jamie Foxx, one of the most talented actors working right now, delivers a strange and effective performance.<br /><br />But while ALI manages to be an effective film, I was left wondering many of the questions that have plagued other reviewers: Why is he like this?  What is the deep-seeded reason for this maddening ten years?  While Smith manages to give us a wonderful recreation of Ali's public self, we fail to glimpse the inner emotion of the man.  Of course, there IS some depth to the character.  While the film spends much of its time glamorizing the man, Ali's improper decision making and moral confusion do detract from his character.  We are not given a flat superhero to watch for almost three hours.  But that being said, the film does fail to convey a real sense of why he is the way he is, of what is driving him.  I do not believe it is Smith's fault: I think the film lacks the necessary depth and complexity to answer these questions.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, ALI is still worth a look.  It captures the time period and its political tension better than many other films and Smith's performance as Ali is just as snappy, witty, and volatile as the original.y, and volatile as the original.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Joel Schumacher's film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is a perfect testemant to what has become the most successful stage production of all time.  Though many people are still wondering why the film wasn't made with it's original stage leads Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, the energetic young cast featured add their own magic to the gothic love story.<br /><br />The story is well-known and I won't go into a blow-by-blow account.  Young diva Christine is mysteriously tutored by someone she believes is her `Angel of Music'.  In reality it is the feared Erik, phantom of the Paris Opera.  Complications arise when Christine is reunited with her childhood sweetheart Raoul.  Erik, too, becomes infatuated with his young pupil.  As passions rise, Christine and Raoul are dragged to the brink of destruction as Erik vows to make Christine his bride...<br /><br />Gerard Butler is a fine Phantom, especially adept at making the role very human and vulnerable, yet also menacing and violent when the situation calls for it.  His singing voice is acceptable (\\"Music of the Night\\", the Phantom's aria, is sailed through with little trouble).  On the whole his performance is quite excellent.<br /><br />Emmy Rossum might very well be the real discovery in this movie.  Little more than a teenager when she made her auspicious debut here as Christine, Miss Rossum is the innocent heart of the story.  A trained New York opera singer since childhood, Emmy Rossum sings Christine's intense and often very difficult arias to perfection.  \\"Think of Me\\", \\"All I Ask of You\\" and in particular her heart-wrenching \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" .  On stage the role of Christine is usually shared by two performers who alternate the 8 performance-week between them,  so demanding is the role of Christine.  Rossum could not have picked a more challenging role to make her big debut, but emerges triumphant.<br /><br />Patrick Wilson, a veteran of Broadway musicals, is perfectly-cast as Raoul.  The role has been somewhat re-written here as a more swashbuckling physical adversary to the Phantom.  He also has a fantastic singing voice as you would expect from his stage pedigree.  Minnie Driver is a hilarious delight as Carlotta, the resident diva of the Opera Populaire who is pushed from her perch to make way for up-and-comer Christine.  Driver's singing is of course dubbed (by Margaret Preece, who has played Carlotta onstage).  Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow play the Opera's bewildered and guileless managers Andre and Firmin to perfection.  Miranda Richardson adds untold depths to the role of mysterious ballet mistress Madame Giry.  In the play her connection with the Phantom is merely alluded to, but here the full story of Giry and the Phantom is revealed.  Jennifer Ellison plays Giry's daughter Meg with verve and spirit.<br /><br />Lloyd Webber has added a new number \\"Learn to Be Lonely\\" which plays over the end credits, sung by Minnie Driver in her own interesting singing voice.  The movie won't displace the stage production in the eyes of it's myriad fans (it was never meant to), rather they  stand side-by-side, for one cannot exist without the other.<br /><br />The film version of PHANTOM has been a long time coming ... but worth the wait.has been somewhat re-written here as a more swashbuckling physical adversary to the Phantom.

B000000H7I|5.0|I listen to a lot of music, and death metal isn't my big thing (I'm more of a hardcore guy), but I love listening to Suffocation whenever I want to break something. I was browsing online on MusicMatch for some songs, and I decided to check out Suffocation, since they were Roadrunner records alumni. I decided to buy some tracks from them. The ones I bought from them are \\"Infecting The Crypts\\", \\"Reincremation\\" and \\"Jesus Wept\\". (I don't buy whole albums, but I listened to tidbits of other songs and loved them as well.) The vocals may not be clean, but this is some death metal I can easily follow by. Deicide failed me, and so did Cannibal Corpse. Suffocation got me on track. \\"Infecting The Crypts\\" is a great anger anthem, and \\"Jesus Wept\\" makes you want to smash some fine china. \\"Reincremation\\" and \\"Mass Obliteration\\" are great tracks as well. Even if you hate death metal, check this album out. It may change your mind.
B00005JNTV|4.0|While it's probably a total cliche to say it by now, Sin City really is a wild thrill ride of a movie, and quite possibly the most entertaining thing that will hit theaters all year.  Adapted by director Robert Rodriguez from Frank Miller's graphic-novel series, it's an energetic slab of neo-noir, complete with twisted characters, ambiguous morality, and deadly serious dialogue.  For those who thought the Kill Bill movies weren't bizarre or violent enough, Sin City ought to seem like a stylish, action-packed gift from guy-movie heaven.  It's filled with negativity, outrageously over the-top bloodletting, and some of the blackest humor known to man, but it all works anyway.  I even managed to forgive the incessant voice-over narration, normally a rather lazy device, because it's so oddly poignant and poetic.  It's not really that big a deal anyway, because this movie is so impressive visually that the characters could speak in gibberish and I'd probably still be moved to give it at least three stars.<br /><br />It should be noted right off the bat that Sin City is not a movie for everyone, but if you're the type who would like it you presumably know who you are.  IF you like crime movies, especially those filled with action and atmosphere, you will almost certainly get a kick out of Sin City.  If you prefer lighter, more \\"socially redeeming\\" fare, you may still like it, or you may be overcome with bile filling your throat for most of its two-hour running time.  It's all a matter of how willing you are to accept what's going on without asking too many nagging questions like \\"How exactly did Mickey Rourke just take out ten armed riot cops with nothing more than his fists and a hatchet?\\" or \\"is it really possible or even necessary to manually tear off a man's scrotum?\\".  Everything about this movie is utterly outsized, from the themes to the characters to the action, but in the end it's a rousing success at what it intends to do, which is entertain.  It's precisely because this movie was so utterly entertaining that I found myself unwilling to nitpick; you'll probably be too busy having your senses assaulted to linger on any problems you may have with the movie.  Nothing is more key in movies (or TV, or novels for that matter) than getting the viewer to suspend disbelief, to simply let go and enjoy what's transpiring regardless of the plausibility level.  Some of my favorite movies are wildly unrealistic, but at some point when watching them I just decided to go with it.  Sin City is one such movie: I realized early on that the events unfolding onscreen bore little to no resemblance to reality as presently constituted; I just didn't care.  I went to see this movie with my wife (who is, to put it mildly, not a fan of dark or violent movies), and she may have summed up the experience of watching it the best when she said simply \\"I was never bored.\\"  That, ultimately, is the secret to Sin City's success: it's so gripping to watch that it's hard to care about anything else.<br /><br />As everyone (and probably their brothers) knows by now, Sin City was filmed using real actors against a black-and-white CGI background with some touches of color added for dramatic effect.  It may seem like a gimmick at first, but Sin City is all about bringing the viewer into a sort of parallel universe, so this unconventional device works perfectly.  Sin City is a movie dealing with lives on the edge, and it conjures up a delightfully dark, grimy, and gritty atmosphere to go match the depravity of its subject matter.  Weighty themes and over-the-top violence abound here, and it's only fitting that the movie's look and feel should be so uniformly haunting.  Consisting of three tangentially related stories occurring out of sequence, Sin City brings the viewer into an underworld populated by thieves, murderers, hookers, and dirty cops, and the morality is viewed entirely in shades of grey.  In the Basin City of the movie, where the good guys are bad and the bad guys are even worse, violence is often a virtue, or at the very least a prerequisite for survival.  If there's one redeeming value to Sin City's cartoonish ultraviolence, it's that it's painfully clear that its recipients generally deserve it.<br /><br />Anyway, if there's one theme running through all of these stories, it's that of redemption.  The protagonist in each tale (Bruce Willis's Hartigan, Rourke's Marv, and Clive Owen's Dwight) is a most unlikely hero (although Hartigan is just a regular cop and therefore not exactly bad, whereas it's clear that Marv and Dwight are murderers), but each finds himself driven to acts of extreme courage and sacrifice in order to see justice done.  Sin City portrays a kind of heroism not typically seen in movies (especially big-budget, sanitized Hollywood productions), one that comes from doing the right thing even when it's nowhere near being the easiest thing.  Rourke's Marv is probably the most memorable character, a hulking thug with a highly overdeveloped sense of vengeance who managed to arouse some of my sympathy even as he cut a swath of unimaginable destruction through his enemies on his way to avenging a murdered prostitute.  Out of the legions of other figures in the movie, the great Benicio Del Toro deserves some special mention as a comically malevolent crooked cop who won't shut up even after he meets his unfortunate end.<br /><br />Now, although I've gone on too long already, I'd feel remiss if I didn't talk about Sin City's staggering violence quotient.  Yes, this an extremely graphic movie, and much of the violence is downright disturbing to watch (Elijah Wood's character being cut up and fed to a wolf is a prominent example, even if much of the violence in that case was implied), but it's just as true that context is an important factor when considering just how offensive such bloodletting is.  Now, for one thing, Sin City is meant to be a piece of escapist cinema, so nothing that takes place onscreen should be taken too seriously anyway.  After all, no one got offended during the scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail when King Arthur cut off the Black Knight's arms and legs; that scene was meant to be funny and it was.  Perhaps more to the point, the violence here is so ludicrously over the top from the opening scene that it's hard to imagine any rational person getting too upset.  You have to just go with it; if you're the kind of person who makes it a point to be huffy and offended all the time you shouldn't be seeing this movie anyway.

B00006F7IM|5.0|Featuring a motley band of eccentric baseball teammates, Major League ranks as one of the best sports comedies ever produced. Released in 1989, it covers the story of the hapless Cleveland Indians (winners of numerous division titles in the decade since) who are inherited by the dead owner's self-centered, bitchy wife, Rachel Phelps. Locating a clause in the team's contract with the city that will allow her to move the team to Miami if attendance falls below two million for the year, she decides to do everything in her power to make the Indians not just losers, but the worst team in history. The result is a memorable excursion in baseball playoff history... <br /> <br />Hiring ex-Toledo Mud Hens manager, turned tire-shop manager, Lou Brown (James Gammon) as the new manager of the Indians, Rachel Phelps begins to construct a team destined to lose - thus sending her to the far more preferable climate-friendly Miami. Bringing in a string of others misfits including Willie Mays Hayes (Wesley Snipes), a lightning bolt speedster who can't hit, Jake Taylor (Tom Berenger), an aging catcher with bad knees, Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen) a high-priced, low-talent free-agent acquisition, Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert), a power-hitter who can't hit a curveball to save his life, and Ricky \\"Wild Thing\\" Vaughn (Charlie Sheen), a fireball pitcher who can't hit the broad side of a barn - a pathetic display of baseball futility quickly ensues. <br /> <br />Longtime Indians announcer Harry Doyle (Bob Uecker) provides a plethora of hilarious one-liners and perfect comic relief as he (whiskey in hand) follows the beginning of a magical season for Cleveland's lovable losers. Off-the-field stories also crop up with Jake's pursuit of his old flame Lynn Wells (Rene Russo), and Ricky Vaughn's affair with rival teammate Roger Dorn's wife Suzanne (Stacy Carroll). <br /> <br />In the end, only one thing on earth can motivate and mold this ragtag crowd of rejects into a playoff contender - their mutual dislike of Rachel Phelps. Downgrading Indian facilities as punishment for each win, she eventually has them flying to games in antique bi-planes and traveling cross-country by bus. Amazingly well-written, Major League is a comedy classic that truly delivers. Love of baseball is a plus, but not necessary for one to enjoy this movie. Funny is funny, and laughter is laughter. They extend beyond the boundaries of sports.  <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0006399FS|5.0|Because U2 is so popular and liked by most people, I think that many people come in here and bash on U2 because they are so popular.  Some people just like to go against what everyone else is saying. <br /> <br />I'm not a big fan of Green Day, but I'm not going to go out of my way to go and leave a negative review... that would just be ridiculous! <br /> <br />Here is the bottum line: This Album is a good U2 album that will not dissapoint.  You may not like all the songs on the album, but there are very few albums by any artist that have albums where every track is \\"awesome\\".  Being a huge U2 fan, I can say there is likely 1 song on every U2 album that I don't care for... but that doesn't mean the album sucks or that U2 sucks. <br /> <br />Don't let the negative reviews fool you, they come from people who delight in negativism, give the cd a chance.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture, and nominated for an additional seven, Gladiator is one of the best produced and directed films of its time. Reminiscent of Mel Gibson's Braveheart, it creates a world so seemingly realistic, that you find yourself drawn backward in time to the glory days of Rome. The musical score, the costumes, and the sets form a synergy that, with lifelike animation, serves to replicate life in early millennial Rome.  <br /> <br />The opening scene of Gladiator is simply awe-inspiring as the Roman legions advance on a band of rebels resisting the empire from the outskirts of Gaul. When the commanders signal the order for attack, the fury of hell is unleashed as flaming arrows and iron bars batter the unified front of the rebel fighters. The scene invokes more memories of Desert Storm than an ancient battlefield, and it visually illustrates the overwhelming power that was once the Roman Empire. <br /> <br />The leader of this battle is Maximus (Russell Crowe), a Roman general loved by his men and admired throughout the empire for his impeccable character. When the aging Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) secretly reveals his plan to appoint Maximus caretaker of Rome upon his death - willing him the task of restoring the Senate and eliminating the dictatorial rule of the Caesars, it sparks the ire of his overly ambitious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). When Commodus murders his father, he asks Maximus to provide his allegiance to the newest emperor of Rome. But Maximus refuses, and Commodus orders his death. <br /> <br />A magnificent fighter in his own right, and enjoying the aid of friends in the legion, Maximus manages to escape his death sentence. Traveling thousands of miles to his home only to find his wife and son murdered, a broken Maximus is taken prisoner and sold as a slave to a man named Proximo (Oliver Reed). The older man hopes to profit from his slaves by training them to become gladiators. <br /> <br />Atthis point, the true action of the movie takes hold, as Maximus (ideal soldier of the Roman Empire) runs roughshod over his opponents in the gladiatorial arena. With every conceivable weapon of the time deployed against him, and sometimes facing down a number of opponents simultaneously, Maximus leaves the ring time and time again as a triumphant victor.  <br /> <br />Having enriched his owner, Maximus eventually makes his way back to Rome where he plans to fight as a gladiator in the greatest arena of all - the Coliseum. Meanwhile, Lucilla (sister of Commodus and former lover of Maximus) works as a power broker behind the scenes, attempting to bring the Senate and the army together in order to remove Commodus and restore the power of the Republic. When Maximus defies Emperor Commodus in front of a packed house at the Coliseum, he's forced to remove his mask and announce his true identity to the Roman people. The revelation leads to an unprecedented gladiatorial contest - Maximus versus a sitting Roman Emperor, with the victor acquiring total power. But the sleazy Commodus has a few tricks up his sleeve, and he doesn't plan to give in easily to arch enemy... <br /> <br />As a work of entertainment, Gladiator is second to none. The action sequences provide endless thrills, and the dialogue between the characters is wrought with political intrigue, lust for power, and conflicting realities. Russell Crowe is superb in his role as the hero Maximus. Noble in his intentions and powerful as a leader, Maximus represents the ideal of honor and chivalry. One of those rare films that forces the audience to root for its characters, Gladiator is a definite must-see film. If you liked the movies Braveheart or The Patriot, then you'll love Gladiator... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00013F35I|4.0|This is a hard DVD to review. It's very good, don't get me wrong. Recorded in April 2002, at Barcelona, Spain, it has an entusiastic and energetic crowd, the E-Street Band at top notch form (as almost always is the case!)and great sound. Bruce had so much confidence in his new album at the time (THE RISING), that he played TEN songs from the album on this show. It is very rare for an artist this old to play so many new songs on tour. Also, it's the first time they released a copmplete concert of him. And this talk about him being \\"old\\" is mean, man. What did you want??? The man had 53 years of age at the time of the concert. He gives his best the whole show, he captivates the audience, he plays guitar, harmonica and keyboards.<br /><br />The trouble here comes from the comparison with the NEW YORK DVD.. Some of the band's energy found there is definitely NOT here in Barcelona... But I can't find who's to blame: if the band'is a little bit more slow really or direction, editing or another technical stuff are responsible for it.  Also, to advertise a 7 minute extra like a \\"documentary about the tour\\" was not very honest...<br /><br />Anyway, this is another necessary product in your Springsteen collection.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The most controversial film of 2004, Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ was widely derided by critics and detractors as a two-hour anti-Semitic pornography/horror flick, complete with splattering blood and arduous torture. But among the Christian community (of which I consider myself a part) and open-minded people who actually saw the film, The Passion stands alone as the most eloquent expression of God's love for mankind ever to grace the big screen. <br /> <br />The Passion certainly is violent, but not anymore violent than similarly rated films of the past ten years. But despite contentions by some evangelical Christians that everyone should see this film, I don't think young children should see it. This movie is for mature audiences only, and I think anyone under the age of sixteen should have a full understanding of the previous events underlying the main focus of the film before viewing it. <br /> <br />The entire movie was filmed in the original Aramaic with English subtitles. This enhances, rather than detracts from, the film's enjoyment because it creates an emotional aura of mystery and sacredness to the subject. Since most people are at least vaguely familiar with the storyline, you won't find yourself distracted by reading subtitles as one might think. With just the opposite effect, you find yourself paying greater attention to the visual images displayed on the screen, and the power of the events unfolding before you is amplified several times over. <br /> <br />The Passion of the Christ combines the four written accounts found in the New Testament Gospels to create a vivid and powerful portrayal of the arrest and crucifixion of Jesus Christ.  <br /> <br />The film opens in the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus of Nazareth (James Caviezel) is engaged in prayer, asking his Father to deliver him through the events soon to come. A satanic figure lurks in the shadows, dispensing a series of temptations and doubts. \\"No one man can bear the sin of the world. It's impossible. It's too much,\\" the figure says. When Jesus refuses to give into Satan's temptations, his disciple Judas arrives to betray him to the Temple Guard... <br /> <br />Gibson's cinematic genius is apparent by his measured and precise use of flashbacks which draws the audience away from the violence in brief intervals so as not to cause an emotional overload. Flashbacks include Jesus teaching to a crowd about his power to \\"lay down my life, and take it back up again,\\" Jesus washing the feet his disciples at the last supper, and Jesus as a playful personality interacting with Mary. One particularly powerful scene traces back to Jesus as a toddler. When he falls down and injures himself, a panicked Mary runs to his rescue. This flashback correlates with the film's portrayal of Jesus stumbling under the weight of the cross. <br /> <br />Overall, this ranks as one of the greatest films ever made. If you believe Jesus of Nazareth was the Biblical Messiah (which this film reviewer does), then The Passion illustrates the enormity of God's sacrifice. But even if you think Jesus was just a mere mortal, this film serves a valuable purpose in that it underscores the barbarity of a human race that, more often than not, persecutes the innocent. Mel Gibson's greatest production to date is a film every student of history, philosophy, and human nature owe it to themselves to see... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This is Megadeth, one of the greatest bands of all time, and this album simply rocks!!! Bozo, you must a chick, right? What's your age, 15? If you are a guy, man you've got serious issues here. First, Blink 182 is a piece of you know what when compared to Megadeth. It is totally nuts to even put these two bands in the same picture. Have you heard of musicianship? Guess not, because Blink do not know not even the existence of that term. Second, in music you DO NOT pay attention to a singer's face, dummy. You pay attention to the lyrics, to the way he sings, to his charisma. Dave Mustaine has got all that and more. Blink? Pleeeeease! Give me a break!!!!!
B00005JLEX|5.0|The preeminent show of the 1990's decade, Seinfeld grew from an idea of \\"a show about nothing\\" into a sacred pop culture icon - not that there's anything wrong with that.  <br /> <br />The show follows the life of comedian Jerry Seinfeld and the exploits of his \\"short, quirky, bald guy\\" best friend, George Costanza (Jason Alexander), Jerry's neurotic neighbor Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards), and Jerry's ex-girlfriend Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Through the years, they're joined by loveable cast of characters that includes Newman, Uncle Leo, the Soup Nazi, Frank and Estelle Costanza, the Bubble Boy, and countless others. <br /> <br />The first and second season DVD offers the very first glimpse into the world Jerry, starting with The Pilot (episode 1) which was originally titled The Seinfeld Chronicles. The first scene involves Jerry commenting to George about a button on his shirt (the same conversation later takes place in the last scene of the series finale). These opening episodes provide insight into the development of the four main characters with conversations that range from George's initial admission that he'd like to be an architect (episode 2) to Kramer's propensity for get rich quick schemes like a make-your-own-pizza pizzeria (episode 4). From day one, Seinfeld established itself as \\"must see TV,\\" creating such memorable episodes as \\"The Stock Tip,\\" \\"The Pony Remark,\\" \\"The Deal,\\" and \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\".  <br /> <br />Below is a list of episodes from the Seinfeld (Seasons 1 & 2) DVD: <br /> <br />Episode 1 (Good News, Bad News) <br />Episode 2 (The Stakeout) <br />Episode 3 (The Robbery) <br />Episode 4 (Male Unbonding) <br />Episode 5 (The Stock Tip) <br />Episode 6 (The Ex-Girlfriend) <br />Episode 7 (The Pony Remark) <br />Episode 8 (The Jacket) <br />Episode 9 (The Phone Message) <br />Episode 10 (The Apartment) <br />Episode 11 (The Statue) <br />Episode 12 (The Revenge) <br />Episode 13 (The Heart Attack) <br />Episode 14 (The Deal) <br />Episode 15 (The Baby Shower) <br />Episode 16 (The Chinese Restaurant) <br />Episode 17 (The Busboy) <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0006399FS|4.0|First off, I rarely review anything. To review something, that album/movie has to be something really special. But I'm really sick of all the negativity surrounding this album. U2 is known for it's diverse sound. The U2 of today does not sound like the U2 of the 80's. There's no denying that, and of course different people have different taste in music. I, personally love U2's Achtung Baby and feel that was and still is the best U2 album out there, but to rate this album anything below 3 stars is really an injustice. And to rate it 1 star, there must be something seriously wrong with that person. Do you mean to say that you don't like anything about this album? Come on guys. This album is not perfect, but I like it. There are many tracks I love listening over and over such as \\"Miracle Drug\\",\\"City Of Blinding Lights\\",\\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\",\\"Vertigo\\",\\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" and \\"Original Of The Species\\". No matter what kind of music you like, or which decade of U2's music you like, you will find most, if not all songs on this album appealing. I have always respected U2 as a band and Bono for his efforts to support charity drives. I mean, the guy is nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize this year. That's part of the reason I always buy U2's albums instead of downloading them. But seriously, this album offers so much, you have to get it, I'm sure you won't regret it.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Winner of two Academy Awards for Best Music (both Original Score and Original Song), The Lion King would have won Best Picture had it not been an animated film. Arguably the greatest full-length Disney feature of all time, The Lion King is a drama of epic proportions, and a film that forever extended the boundaries of the animation genre. Hans Zimmer creates an original score that is second to none in cinematic history, and Elton John's hit single swept the nation at the time of the film's release. With powerful and sweeping visual sequences, the use of a timeless plot device, and brilliant direction, the film will stand the test of time as one of the best to ever be produced. <br /> <br />The story is set in Pride Rock, a serene jungle paradise on the African plain. All of the animals live in a harmonious ecosystem, ruled by the greatest animal of all - the strongest and wisest lion, King Mufasa. When Mufasa's wife gives birth to the lion cub Simba, the young heir's Uncle Scar begins plotting the overthrow of his brother and the taking of the kingdom by force. Forming a conspiracy with a pack of wild hyenas, Scar's evil plan is to lure Simba and Mufasa into a valley where the hyenas stir up a herd of wilder beasts which end up trampling Mufasa and leaving him clinging for his life to the edge of a cliff. With his brother's life hanging in the balance, Scar seizes the opportunity to send his brother hurling to a bloody death. <br /> <br />With Mufasa dead, and Simba too young to defend the kingdom, Scar and the hyenas rise to power. Pride Rock is soon reduced to a desolate wasteland as its newest rulers ravage the landscape, while Simba is forced into exile. Fleeing to a faraway land free of predators, Simba grows up and befriends Pumbaa and Timon, two animals who live a carefree life feasting on grubs and insects. <br /> <br />But as time passes, a chance encounter reunites Simba with his childhood love Nala. Falling in love with each other, Nala tells Simba aboutthe sad state of affairs in Pride Rock. She urges him to return, but it takes the return of Mufasa in the form of a ghostly cloud in order to convince Simba of his true destiny... <br /> <br />With the help of Nala and the other lionesses of Pride Rock, Simba returns to stake his claim as the rightful heir to the kingdom and to exact justice on Scar for his father's cold-blooded murder. Together, Simba and the lionesses defeat Scar and hyenas, and Pride Rock once again becomes the utopian paradise it once was under Mufasa's philosopher king rule. As the movie ends, the animal kingdom is presented with Simba's newborn son - and the circle of life continues unabated... <br /> <br />Widely considered the best animated film in Disney's arsenal, and certainly the best of the computer-generated era, The Lion King is a cinematic masterpiece in any medium. If you tend to shy away from animated films as childlike or simply just not your cup of tea, you would be well advised to make an exception and check out The Lion King DVD. It is quite simply an extraordinary epic, replete with dazzling choreography, well-blended musical scores, and characters the audience loves to root for. In one particular scene, the Disney animators' use of Leni Riefenstahl's patented camera angles to capture the hyenas marching in lock-step under the singular review of Scar creates an abundance of subconscious images reminiscent of Hitler and the Third Reich. This illusion plants a manifestation of evil in the mind of the viewer that is instantly connected to Scar and his evil intentions... That's the type of symbolic and all-engrossing power Disney utilizes in this wonderful masterpiece - loved by children, but a deep and breathtaking film for the adult viewer nonetheless... <br /> <br />The DVD Report

B000069HZP|5.0|One of Michael Douglas's least appreciated films, The Game is an intriguing movie dripping with suspense. With an intensity which few films can rival, The Game quickly moves from one surprising scene to the next, always catching its audience off guard and creating a thrilling, edge-of-your-seat atmosphere. If you haven't seen The Game, you have no idea what you've been missing... <br /> <br />Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is an extremely wealthy San Francisco banker, living in an opulent estate just outside of the city. But Nicholas is not a happy man. He generally spends his time alone, the exception being when he spends time with his clients brokering lucrative business deals. Nicholas even spends his birthday alone, and on his forty-eighth birthday, Nicholas is forced to reflect on the fact that his father committed suicide at the same age. <br /> <br />But this year, Nicholas's birthday takes an unexpected twist when his estranged younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn) arrives unannounced at the Van Orton estate. A former drug addict involved in all sorts of nefarious schemes in the past, Nicholas remains skeptical of the true reasons for his brother's return. However, Conrad soon manages to convince Nicholas that his only reason for returning is to give his lonely, boring brother a birthday present he'll never forget. What exactly is the gift? <br /> <br />It's a very expensive entertainment package provided by a firm called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Curious as to what sort of entertainment they provide, Nicholas visits CRS where he undergoes a series of mental, physical, and psychological tests to make sure he can handle what they offer. In return, CRS agrees to customize the adventure of a lifetime for Nicholas - as they do for famous and wealthy executives all over the globe... <br /> <br />But when strange things start to take place and those are followed by seemingly horrendous events, Nicholas must make use of his intellect and his instinctsin order to survive. Afraid the events are part of a misguiding sense of humor on the part of the employees at CRS, Nicholas arrives at their office building prepared to cancel the entertainment package. But to his dismay, the office space is vacant and the landlord has never heard of CRS. Even worse, Nicholas finds out that every financial account he owns has been wiped clean and that a criminal organization has been pulling similar heists on wealthy industrialists all over the world. Uncertain of his future, Nicholas sets out to get to the bottom of the truth, and in doing so, he finds out the truth about himself... <br /> <br />Far from a blockbuster commercial success when it was first released in 1997, The Game is an unknown entity among most casual movie watchers. As such, those who stumble upon The Game will be duly impressed with the quality of this cinematic gem. Featuring two show-stopping performances by Michael Douglas and Sean Penn, The Game is an instant fan favorite among those who've seen it. Boasting one of the more suspense riddled screenplays of the past decade, The Game is a definite must-see film you won't want to miss... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
0671042858|2.0|Okay, to start with we have Stephen King, a truly gifted horror writer who can squeeze terror out of any situation, even the most mundane.  We then have a tried-and-true scary situation; a little girl lost in the woods, with an unseen evil apparently stalking her.  This SHOULD have been utterly terrifying.  It SHOULD have been gripping, suspenseful and impossible to put down.  I SHOULD have found myself unable to sleep after reading it because I was trembling too badly.  The problem was, none of this happened.<br /><br />This is a short book for King (only 260 pages) and it seems like a large chunk of it is missing; mainly, the good part.  For the first 200 pages, King describes the first week that his little girl hero is lost in the woods.  He describes it not only day by day but hour by hour.  Over that time, the girl is a little bit scared, a little bit hungry, a little bit uncomfortable, but never shows the level of dismal fear that any 9-year-old girl would actually be showing at this point; King's hero actually talks and acts more like a sassy 13 or 14-year-old, and her inner thoughts are more like those of a bright college kid!<br /><br />Then, after that first 200 pages, King skips ahead by about 4 or 5 days to a point where the hero is finally REALLY tired, REALLY hungry...although still not really scared.  She never gets scared, so neither do we.  When we finally meet the invisible evil that has been stalking her, the discovery is dull, common, and not only not scary, it's almost silly.  I found myself wanting to rewind this book and write my own version, but better!<br /><br />If King had actually described this lost-in-the-woods experience from the viewpoint of a small child, the book would have been gripping and entertaining even if it wasn't terrifying.  As it was, I felt like I was reading about some high school or college kid who was in a mildly unpleasant situation---nothing to be really concerned about.  This book will make its way back to the used book store in record time, no doubt about it.book store in record time, no doubt about it.
B0001L3MI0|4.0|Winner of the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, Independence Day is a true summer blockbuster in the traditional sense. Released on July 4, 1996, the film enjoyed a long run in theaters across America, and the larger than life plot line made this sci-fi thriller one of the biggest commercial draws of its time. From an entertainment standpoint, it deserved every bit of attention. Because Independence Day is an epic that a wide-ranging number of movie-goers will find fun and enjoyable... <br /> <br />When Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) looks forward to his acceptance by NASA in the astronaut training program, he experiences a rude awakening when strange movements of clouds hover into the area and reveal themselves to be alien spaceships. As the world's leading governments and militaries go on high alert, the world holds its breath waiting to see what will happen next. Against the backdrop of this worldwide event, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) notices a peculiar pattern in the spaceship deployment. Along with his father Julius (Judd Hirsch), he urgently travels from New York to Washington DC in order to warn the president of impending danger (his ex-wife is an aide to the president, thus providing him with a means of access). <br /> <br />Despite their past differences, David manages to convince President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) that the true intent of the alien spacecraft is invasion, and no olive branch of peace will appease them. When David's assertion proves to be right, most of the world's major cities are utterly destroyed by a super laser emanating from the undersides of the monstrous, city-sized alien structures. As all-out war ensues, earthlings quickly discover that the alien craft are protected by an impenetrable force field, thus rendering their desperate attacks useless. <br /> <br />As refugees crowd into the rural areas of America, Capt. Hiller is brought to Area 51 and introduced to the president. The once mysterious location is revealed to house an alien spacecraft identical to the ones which now threaten earth, and plans are put in place to make this craft operational once again. But, still, the problem remains of how to go about defeating the alien invaders... The answer comes to David when his father tells him not to catch cold. <br /> <br />With a new plan, David and Hiller fly the alien spacecraft right into the bowels of enemy territory. Captured inside the mothership, Smith and Goldblum act out one of the more memorable scenes of the movie when they enjoy a pair of cigars while held in captivity. Goldblum's character, who earlier derided cigars as deathtraps, can now appreciate some of the finer aspects of a life he now realizes could end at any time. In fact, it makes me want to go light up a fine Arturo Fuente right now!  <br /> <br />Overall, I didn't expect to like this film, and I did. Surprisingly similar in its plot devices to the George Lucas hit The Return Of The Jedi, Independence Day is nevertheless a fun and enjoyable film. The storyline of human versus alien tends to evoke a subconscious adrenaline in even the most casual of viewers, leading to an emotionally involved audience anxious to discover the outcome of this modern day war of the worlds. Although by no means is this to be considered one of the greatest films of all time, it ranks as a definite must-see as a result of its overall entertainment value. Take a chance and go see it if you haven't done so already... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0000524CY|5.0|I avoided seeing this moview for years. I was never scared of the dark; instead, I was scared of what was in the dark waiting to get me.I never did like horror movies. When I finally saw it, it was nothing like what I expected. It was a masterpiece. <br /> <br />I am a member of the clergy but not a Roman Catholic. That too gave me pause. It need not have. This film is respectful of the Roman church and it is also respectful of the concept of possession. It treats it in a \\"real\\" manner. The special effects are not gratuitous but are part of the story. They are minor by today's standards but they too are superlative in their restraint and authenticity. <br /> <br />This movie teaches some valuable lessons, especially in our modern culture. Too often, we deny the existence of evil except as an \\"absence of good\\". This movie takes the opposite tack and deals with evil as a real and tangible force to be reckoned with. The realism with which this is portrayed is one of the things that makes this movie so potentially frightening. There is, however, some good news that this movie brings out. <br /> <br />Evil is powerful but it is not omnipotent. It can be fought successfully. This does not mean there are not consequences but that is the nature of evil. It disrupts what is good. <br /> <br />Another powerful lesson is that we as humans are given the authority to combat evil. This too is brought out. <br /> <br />Don't expect this movie to give you warm fuzzy feelings...unless you like the idea that good triumphs over evil. It does and this movie is a masterpiece that depicts that fact.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|A modern-day fairy tale rife with cutting edge humor, Shrek is a computer-animated film for the ages. In the tradition of Disney (the recipient of a number of clever jibes throughout the movie), Dreamworks manages to create a film that adults (and not just parents) will enjoy as much as children. The comedy is clean, witty, and refreshing. The animation is mind-blowing, and the characters are as likeable as any ever created.<br /><br />The story follows the life of Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers), a green ogre with a friendly disposition who lives in a swamp during medieval times. When ever-so-short, midget nobleman Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) banishes all local fairy-tale creatures from his land, they are forced to resettle in Shrek's swamp. Shrek, who prefers to live in solitude, sets off, accompanied by a wisecracking mule named Donkey (Eddie Murphy), to find Lord Farquaad and convince him to leave the fairy-tale characters where they belong, and leave his leave his swampland alone. Lord Farquaad agrees to honor Shrek and Donkey's request under one condition. The odd couple must locate the beautiful Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and bring her back to Duloc so that he can marry her (he chooses her as his bride over Snow White and Sleeping Beauty because he wants to become king). Although Princess Fiona is held in a tower guarded by a fire-breathing dragon, the task is one Shrek and Donkey are more than capable of taking on...<br /><br />Shrek is quite simply of one of the best films of its time. The computer-generated image animation creates a fantastic setting filled with unique, groundbreaking characters. The storyline (basically Beauty and the Beast) is timeless, and the comedy manages to stand on its own in a movie that pushes the outer-boundaries of excellence. Eddie Murphy is at his best playing the Donkey, and Mike Myers may also have put in his best cinematic performance to date. Shrek is one of the few animated films ever made that should be seen by adultswho don't have children (in other words, those who otherwise wouldn't bother to see an animated film). So if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and give Shrek a try...<br /><br />The DVD Report
B00005A0N5|5.0|Nightwish's second album takes a stunning shift from Angel's Fall First.  It is on a major European metal label and has excellent production qualities.  The vocalist and musicians are completely sure of themselves and perfect their qualities and bring them together in nothing short of a stunning album performance.  The meld of power metal and classical music, with Tarja's operatic vocals is nothing short of perfect.  The first track is very poweful in its successful attempt to net you into their Oceanworld.  \\"Stargazers\\" shows how Tarja can successfully combine lyrical singing with vocal arias. <br /> <br />Wilska provides vocals on two tracks.  The superior of the two tracks in \\"The Phaharo Sailed to Orion.\\"  A lot of fans will complain about the male vocals, I see nothing wrong with them.  They are in no way taking away Tarja's performance.  Male vocals are a part of every single Nightwish album ever to be released.  If nothing else, it adds to her vocalability.   <br /> <br />The Nightwish instrumetnal is a metalized version of something you would hear in Riverdance.  And their cover of \\"Walking in the Air\\" is nothing short of stunning.  A beautiful balad.  The bonus track \\"Sleeping Sun\\" a huge fan favourite is excellent.  That is why it is a fan favourite.  It is perhaps one of the best balads Nightwish has ever done.   <br /> <br />If you are a fan of Nightwish or are looking to be, or interested in something different, you owe it to yourself to pick this album up.  It is still my favourite Nightwish album to date.
B00062J00S|5.0|The quintessential holiday Christmas classic, It's A Wonderful Life has dominated the seasonal television landscape with its story of love, friendship, and one man's exceedingly relevant life. Filmed in 1946, this Frank Capra masterpiece opened in theaters to a lukewarm reception, but quickly rose in stature following repeated annual television airings in the 1960s to present day. The film is centered around the life of George Bailey - a likeable, ambitious resident of Bedford Falls who harbors dreams of grandeur, but begins to question the meaning of his life when things don't work out according to his plan. <br /> <br />When the story begins, George is a young boy employed by Mr. Gower, the neighborhood druggist. Mr. Gower, having just received news of his son's death - and engaged in the act of getting drunk - inadvertently places poison in a medicine bottle. George discovers the mistake and doesn't deliver the medicine, thus averting a major disaster. The opening scenes also show George saving his brother from certain death by pulling him out of a frozen pond where the ice had broken. <br /> <br />From there, the story jumps several years into the future, where a grown up George harbors dreams of world travel, exploration, and the construction of large buildings. But he ends up staying in Bedford Falls to work for his father's business, a small savings & loan (and the only financial institution in Bedford Falls not owned by the miserly Mr. Potter). Eventually, George falls in love with childhood friend Mary and the two wed, choosing to renovate an old house in Bedford Falls. <br /> <br />When the Great Depression strikes, George uses his own money, ingenuity, and personal demeanor to stave off a bank run that threatens to close down the family business. In so doing, George keeps Mr. Potter from using his numerous resources to force a takeover bid of Bailey Savings & Loan. Thus, he saves the town's residents from being subjected to a Potter monopoly with possiblydisastrous consequences. Along the way, George is tempted with offers of riches and travel by Mr. Potter, but he turns him down - opting instead to work for the benefit of the community. <br /> <br />Things seem to be going well for George until his Uncle Billy absentmindedly leaves the daily deposit of the business in a newspaper that he throws in Mr. Potter's lap (while boasting about the military honors bestowed on George's brother). While George and Uncle Billy frantically search for the misplaced $8,000, Mr. Potter sees his opportunity to ruin the Bailey Savings & Loan once and for all. When George appeals to Potter for help, Potter threatens to call the authorities. <br /> <br />Disillusioned, George leaves Potter's office and wanders into the night. After leaving the local bar, he runs his car into a tree and then walks over to a nearby bridge. While on the bridge, George contemplates suicide as a way out. But before he can commit the act, a man falls into the water below. George jumps in to save him, and later finds out that the man's name is Clarence. Clarence claims to be angel working to get his wings. He jumped into the water to save George, and when George wishes he had never been born - Clarence aims to show George exactly what the world would be like had he never been born... <br /> <br />What he sees leads George to believe that his life was more than worth living. He decides to return home to his wife and children and face the consequences of the misplaced money. When he returns home, he finds that people from all over Bedford Falls have come to donate their own money to bail out their good friend George and the community fixture, Bailey Savings & Loan. Clarence receives his wings, and George Bailey is thankful for his numerous blessings. <br /> <br />It's A Wonderful Life is almost magical in its idyllic portrayal of Depression-era, small-town America. The characters (with the exception of Mr. Potter), harkens back to a simpler time when public attitudes toward morality prevailed, where neighbors knew each other by name, and where communities helped each other out. In addition, George Bailey and his friends are likeable people, developing a rapport with the audience that makes the viewer actively root for them and care about what happens to them. This personal connection with the audience (and the audience ability to relate to questioning the meaning of one's life) may well be the key to the enduring success of the story. Having spent over five decades as the number one Christmas movie, It's A Wonderful Life ranks as one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00006F7IM|5.0|It is not nearly as well written or deep in character as Bull Durham, but for sheer fun, Major League may actually be better.  All the players are entertaining but the two who really sell the film are James Gammon as the manager, Lou Brown.  The scene that truly epitomizes Lou's character is when he is first called by the Indian's personnel director.  Lou is at his car repair shop and is offered the dream job of managing a major league team.  He ponders and says, \\"I dunno, Charlie.  I gotta rotate a set of tires.\\"  The other show-stealer in the film is absolutely Bob Eucker as the play-by-play announcer who manages to deliver with straight-faced sincerity lines like, \\"In case you haven't noticed and judging by attendance you haven't, the Indians are threatening to climb out of the cellar!\\"  It is predictable and sometimes cliche as all get out, but you WILL laugh at this film, make no mistake.
B00001U0E1|5.0|I just read the review by the fellow who was complaining that the film is not historically accurate.  Correct:  it's a fiction, big surprise.  Was he looking for some new historical insight into the actual life of the man?<br /><br />Come on everyone, this is a fancy on what might of been and what we might imagine in fun around a fire with a good bottle of wine.  And it comes off brilliantly.  The allusions are fun, the wit is everywhere, the casting is great (aside from Ben Affleck -- did they worry about billing with Geoffrey Rush, Joe Feinnes, and Gwyneth Paltrow?), the pace is quick, the plot interesting -- even if not historically accurate (hello?), the acting is excellent, the romance lovely, the play, the tragedy spot on.<br /><br />I actually can't imagine not enjoying this movie.  Everyone I know enjoyed it very much.  It's great fun, enjoy.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|I really don't remember why I bought Afterglow, I just walked into the store one day and purchased it. I am so glad I did because buying this album has opened up a whole new world of music for me, when I bought this album it led me to getting into the music of Tori Amos and Alanis Morissette. Afterglow is an amazing album, not just the title! It has some of the best songs you may ever listen to in your life. Afterglow was a huge hit for Sarah and catapulted her back into the public eye after a 6 year hiatus.<br /><br />Afterglow is hugely layered and sometimes McLachlan's vocals get a bit whispery. Some of the songs to many people are a tier below previous albums, however to me some of the songs are as good as the songs on Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, one of these songs is the lead single \\"Fallen\\". Fallen is without a doubt the best song on the album, it is perfect in everyway. Rarely is a song so perfect, the lyrics are complex and work amazingly well with the music which is addictive.<br /><br />Another song to be released from the album \\"World On Fire\\" is a beautiful song that got a GRAMMY nomination in the Music Video Category. It has a superb video, directed by Sophie Muller. This song is a charity song. The production is top-notch. \\"Stupid\\" starts off innocent but then builds into a great rock song with a superb chorus. This song is one of my favourites from this album.<br /><br />Many people consider \\"Drifting\\" to be the weakest track on the album, however I like it. On this album there are no weak tracks so how can it be bad? Sarah's soothing voice adds to the vigour of the song. Another of my favourites, \\"Train Wreck\\" is the song that has the honour of being the half-way mark of the album. This song is amazing. I enjoy the way the guitar blends with the piano.<br /><br />\\"Push\\" starts off what I call the layered half of the album. While not as layered as some of the songs it has some nice vocals, superb production and a \\"do da da do da da...\\" that sounds alot like the theme song of Dawson's Creek. \\"Answer\\" reminds me of \\"Ice\\" off her 3rd album Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. It is a very emotional track that wrenches at your heart and deminds your tears.<br /><br />\\"Time\\" is another great song off this album. It's a great song that could in my opinion win a GRAMMY. I love the lyrics on this song, they are the best on the album. The chorus is great as well. \\"Perfect Girl\\" is very layered and mysterious. It's a great track anyway. The layers really work wonders on this song. To finish the album \\"Dirty Little Secret\\" does it with wonders. The minimalistic approach works with some simple, beautiful layers.<br /><br />Overall, Afterglow is pure HEAVEN. All the songs are amazing and flow really well. The album has absolutely no filler tracks or songs that seem out of place. Sarahs voice is so strong on this album and she conveys all the emotions she has dealed with over the past six years into this album making it that much better to listen to. I really do hope that we don't have to wait 6 more years for her next album.Creek. \\"Answer\\" reminds me of \\"Ice\\" off her 3rd album Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.

B00008PW2D|4.0|Based on the bestselling novel by Candace Bushnell, the HBO original series Sex And The City took the television world by storm following its release in the summer of 1998. Following the exploits of four young and educated female friends living and working in New York City, the show revolves around the various relationships and life problems experienced by each member of the group. Sporting an experienced and talented cast, the show has developed a strong, borderline fanatic following... <br /> <br />Sarah Jessica Parker (the de facto lead character of the show) stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a popular sex columnist for a local newspaper who travels in numerous Manhattan social circles. Carrie is engaged in a tempestuous on-again, off-again relationship with a mystery man always referred to as \\"Mr. Big\\". The young urban professional shares her life with three best friends who have similarly interesting jobs - Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon), a lawyer tired of being single given the societal ramifications; Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), a promiscuous publicist who enjoys non-exclusive relationships; and Charlotte McDougal (Kristin Davis), an art museum curator who is relatively less open about her sexuality... Together, the women seek each other's advice on the ever-present and varying predicaments in which they find their romantic relationships...  <br /> <br />The Sex And The City (Season 5) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere \\"Anchors Away\\" in which a sailor invites Carrie to a 'Fleet Week' party (only to have her go home alone due to her inability to forget about her past relationships with Aidan and Mr. Big). Meanwhile, Charlotte has a less than pleasing experience with a naval officer, and Samantha goes to extremes to let the neighborhood know of Richard's infidelities... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include \\"Unoriginal Sin\\" in which Samantha gets back together with Richard and Miranda agrees to baptize Brady, and \\"The BigJourney\\" in which Carrie's book tour takes her out to San Francisco where she's reunited with Mr. Big... <br /> <br />Below is a list of episodes included on the Sex And The City (Season 5) DVD: <br /> <br />Episode 67 (Anchors Away) <br />Episode 68 (Unoriginal Sin)  <br />Episode 69 (Luck Be an Old Lady)  <br />Episode 70 (Cover Girl)  <br />Episode 71 (Plus One is the Loneliest Number)  <br />Episode 72 (Critical Condition)  <br />Episode 73 (The Big Journey)  <br />Episode 74 (I Love a Charade)  <br /> <br />The DVD Report

B0001I55OC|1.0|I find it hard to believe just how bad this film is. Laughable acting, beyond stupid situations, stereotypes that would embarrass stereotypes, no logic at all and editing that left me dumbfounded. Apart from the reasonable special effects and decent locations the film comes across as a particularly poor student effort that needed a tutor to step in.    Avoid at all costs and read the excellent book that at least does not make out every person from England is the Antichrist, every Scot is a 'Braveheart' and the French are poor, sweet little innocents.    The only thing this disaster wins at is how many times it is possible to get the actors to say, \\"Oh my God!\\". I counted at least 30. I wish the script writer had been sent and left back in the Middle Ages. Awful.
B000002BQK|5.0|Where to start? Butterfly is arguably, Ms.Carey's best piece of work she has ever created. The album, being produced and written (aside from the cover of Prince's \\"The Beautiful Ones\\") by Carey herself, is smothered in sincere vocals and raw, honest emotions. From the sultry, smoldering lyrics of \\"Honey,\\" to the heartfelt and revealing words of \\"Outside,\\" this album is filled with beautiful music and deep, meaningful lyrics.  Though Butterfly is not her best selling album it is most definitely her most personal and in my opinion, most mature album Mariah Carey has ever made. Breaking away from what the music corporations wanted her to portray, Carey made it clear that this album symbolizes her freedom from the control of the business side of music.  Every song on this album tells a story and despite I first owned this album when I was 12, the lyrics, to this day, both amaze and leave me in awe. Some may write Carey off as a pop music protege with bubble gum lyrics, but pick up one of her albums and you will find yourself sadly mistake. I do admit that she has written very \\"universal\\" lyrics for a few of her singles, by if you take a deeper look, even her \\"bubble gum\\" singles are filled with words that you yourself have no clue as to what they mean; Most people wouldn't even be able to rhyme half of the $50 words she tosses about in her songs, the way she does.  Butterfly is a perfect example of Carey's writing and vocal abilities. Listen to the songs \\"Butterfly,\\" \\"My All,\\" and \\"Breakdown,\\" and you'll understand what I mean when I say that her voice combined with her talent for writing will leave you awestruck. This masterpiece if a true R and B album, not the \\"Crunk and B\\" or wannabe hip hop R and B, but true soul. Yes, there are songs that come off as being a bit \\"Poppish\\" but they flow so mellifluously with the album that you wouldn't even notice. Butterfly is truly a timeless, unforgettable work of art that, like many of her albums, has cemented Mariah Carey in the worldwide music hall of fame.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Starring John Cusack and Ray Liotta, Identity is a film which opened to little of the commercial fanfare associated with a blockbuster movie. But this is a film that packs all of the suspense and entertainment value of The Sixth Sense into an original screenplay about a serial killer on the loose. Haunting in its presentation, yet far from a traditional horror film, Identity follows the exploits of ten strangers who become stranded at a Nevada hotel in the midst of a massive rainstorm. One-by-one, they are being killed off, but no one knows the true identity of the killer... <br /> <br />A number of seemingly unrelated people gather at a small roadside motel in a Nevada desert location. Strangers to each other, the people descend from all different types of professions and lifestyles - a limousine driver and his movie star client, a policeman (Ray Liotta) transporting a convict, two parents with their young son, a prostitute (Amanda Peet), a young couple, and the motel's manager (John Hawkes). All of them are trapped on the grounds of the motel due to a record rainstorm that's made the roads impassable. Beset by darkness, each of the motel guests resigns to his fate and settles down to ride out the storm. The guests even make an attempt to socialize with one another. <br /> <br />But when one motel guest turns up dead, suspicions are raised. When it's revealed that an escaped convict, (Jake Busey), is on the loose, the guests become panicked. Ed (John Cusack) becomes de facto leader of the small group of strangers who begin suspect each other when the convict is captured and the killings continue. Is the true killer among them? Or is someone else (or something else) on the motel grounds with them? Far away, in an undisclosed location, a psychiatrist is feverishly attempting to prove the innocence of a man accused of murder, and the answer lies right before him... <br /> <br />Although it's a decent film, Identity falls into the teenage horror film device of having each character wander off alone - despite the fact that people who wander off alone continually turn up dead. However, I'm usually willing to overlook such things if the rest of the film is decent because a movie's objective is to entertain, and Identity does that... <br /> <br />The darkness of the setting, coupled with intermittent thunder and the pattering of rain, create an all-encompassing sense of suspense bordering on fear. Rain muffles sound, so how can you hear if someone's sneaking up behind you? Identity is a unique and original film most movie lovers will enjoy. The plot device is employed with the utmost efficiency, keeping the audience guessing until the very end. Who is the real killer? You'll have to watch Identity to find out... <br /> <br />Presenting a knockout performance by John Cusack, Identity is one of the surprise films of 2003. The dialogue is fresh, not stiff, and the characters are well-rounded considering many of them do not live through most of the scenes. With a surprise ending reminiscent of 1990s smash hits, The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects, Identity (although nowhere near as good as those films) is a film you won't want to miss. Due to its well-written storyline and crescendo of suspense, Identity is a definite must-see movie... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B000002UJQ|5.0|A brilliant album from a remarkable band.  With \\"OK Computer\\", Radiohead has solidified their stellar status within rock music history.  Already viewed as a classic album, this album will only continue to expand in terms of greatness and recognition.  Released at a time when rock in general had fallen on some hard times, OK Computer lifted up the genre and 'saved rock 'n' roll for a moment or two.  Each of its twelve songs are completely different from one another, yet somehow fit together as one harmonious entity.  Most of these songs are admittedly dark, however it does not diminish their power or beauty.  There is something beautifully uplifting about them.  These songs take you away to a place you've never been before.  They shake you up and stir you.  The more you listen to these songs the more they open up and become exposed as the great epic masterpieces they are.  Radiohead has a way of making many other rock bands appear childish and silly.  Yorke and company are cleary among rock's elite.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|1999 was definitely the best year for music. In that year, we saw the debut albums from Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Jennifer Lopez, a Latina from the Bronx who worked her way to the top from her days as a struggling dancer on the TV show \\"In Living Color.\\" This is her amazing 1999 debut album with hits like \\"If You Had My Love\\" and \\"Waiting for Tonight.\\" At the time, Ms. Lopez was dating P.Diddy before they split on friendly and amicable terms. Jennifer Lopez is one classy lady, which is a rare thing in this pop climate!  <br />

0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones, in my mind, was compelling and very riveting.  The beginning starts out with action and suspense to capture a reader.

B000683VI4|5.0|Adapted to screen from the Nicholas Sparks novel of the same name, The Notebook is one of the best romantic dramas to hit the big screen in decades. Garnering high marks from a wide-range of critics, The Notebook is a funny and emotional film which deals with love, relationships, and the risks people take. James Garner turns in a notable performance as the elder man, Duke, who reads the pages of his notebook to dying nursing home resident Allie (Gena Rowlands). Overall, this is a classic \\"chick flick\\" with a dramatic twist. Set in the World War II era, The Notebook is a great film... <br /> <br />Duke (James Garner) regularly reads from the pages of a notebook to an older woman in a nursing home. Suffering from Alzheimer's disease, her memories of the parts which he's read in the past appears and disappears without order, but Duke continues to read to her because of their deep and enduring friendship. <br /> <br />The notebook's story centers around the lives of a teenage boy and girl who meet at a carnival in the late-1930s. At first, Allie Hamilton doesn't know what to think of Noah Calhoun, but she soon gives into his insistence that they go out on a date. When Noah and Allie fall deeply in love, Allie's parents try to break up the couple. The Hamiltons are rich, and Noah and his father are from the poor side of town. Nevertheless, Allie and Noah are determined to be together. <br /> <br />When World War II breaks out, Noah is sent into conflict. He writes numerous letters to his love, but they go unanswered because Allie's parents are hiding the letters as well as her replies to Noah. After several years apart, Allie becomes engaged to successful businessman. But after reading a newspaper article concerning Noah's restoration of a historic home he once promised her, she decides to go visit him. <br /> <br />Allie's visit with Noah turns both their worlds upside down when they learn the truth about the letters. Now, Allie must choose between the fiance she trulyloves and the man who is her real true love... <br /> <br />Actor Ryan Gosling is entertaining and likeable in his portrayal of the young and energetic Noah Calhoun. The Notebook as a film is better served by featuring his superb talents. Likewise, up-and-coming actress Rachel McAdams is brilliant in her role as Allie. The emotions of her young romance are clearly conveyed by a natural and instinctive penchant for delivering her lines in just the right way. Call it onscreen charisma or whatever, but McAdams is one to look out for in the future. <br /> <br />In short, The Notebook is as good a film as it is as a book. Few books translate onto the big screen as well as they read in print, so The Notebook is to be heralded for its ability to do so. Charming and easy to like, the film glorifies the romance of a young couple who find true love - a love that lasts forever. Well-produced and featuring some amazing shots of natural locations, The Notebook ranks as a definite must-see film. Do yourself a favor and go see it today... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
0316666343|4.0|The beginning of this story sets the foundation for the entire book, but it was extremely difficult for me to get through.  This was good in a way as the writing is so powerful that I found myself grieving for the heroine and her family.  It was a bit too real and graphic for me to not be affected.  Having said that, when I read the last page, I was still reaching for tissue, but the book is now on my favorites lists.  I felt it was a wonderful and gripping story of hope.

B00005JLKB|5.0|Leaping onto the television landscape in Fall 2001, Smallville follows the exploits of a young Clark Kent in the years leading up to his emergence as the beloved Superman. Following a slew of TV renditions of the character's life since the comic book first appeared, Smallville sets itself apart by focusing on the lesser discussed niche of Clark's earliest developmental days. Superb casting and consistent writing have combined to make Smallville one of the more popular shows on television (especially in international markets), making the show one of the WB network's most successful creations to date... <br /> <br />Tom Welling stars in the imminent role of teenager Clark Kent, a refugee from the dying planet of Krypton. His ship having landed in the rural American town of Smallville, Clark is raised by locals Martha (Annette O'Toole) and Jonathan Kent (John Schneider - of Dukes of Hazzard fame) as their own son. Unlike some of the film and TV spin-offs, Smallville attributes powers to other individuals in the area as a result of some of the debris associated with Krypton's destruction. As a result, Clark is forced to keep his own powers a secret while battling against other individuals who are more powerful than traditional human criminal elements. The show also provides a glimpse into the early friendship experienced between Clark and Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) as well as Clark's romance with two high school classmates, Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) and Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk). Part sci-fi fantasy and part teenage soap, Smallville is an instant television classic... <br /> <br />The Smallville (Season 1) DVD offers a number of exciting episodes including the series premiere in which the stage for the series is set by recounting the story of Clark's voyage to earth in the aftermath of Krypton's destruction. Clark meets Lex Luthor for the first time as well as a human mutated by the strange green rocks which accompanied Clark's spacecraft in the meteor shower...Other notable episodes from Season 1 include \\"Hourglass\\" in which the green rocks enable one man to reverse the aging process so that he can seek revenge on his enemies, and \\"Stray\\" in which a runaway kid named Ryan has the power to read minds, prompting his stepparents to attempt to exploit him for financial gain...  <br /> <br />Below is a list of episodes included on the Smallville (Season 1) DVD: <br /> <br />Episode 1 (Pilot)  <br />Episode 2 (Metamorphosis)  <br />Episode 3 (Hothead)  <br />Episode 4 (X-Ray)  <br />Episode 5 (Cool)  <br />Episode 6 (Hourglass)  <br />Episode 7 (Craving)  <br />Episode 8 (Jitters)  <br />Episode 9 (Rogue)  <br />Episode 10 (Shimmer)  <br />Episode 11 (Hug)  <br />Episode 12 (Leech)  <br />Episode 13 (Kinetic)  <br />Episode 14 (Zero)  <br />Episode 15 (Nicodemus)  <br />Episode 16 (Stray)  <br />Episode 17 (Reaper)  <br />Episode 18 (Drone)  <br />Episode 19 (Crush)  <br />Episode 20 (Obscura)  <br />Episode 21 (Tempest)  <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B000099T2L|3.0|Since the beginning of destiny's child everyone has always questioned why beyonce sang all the leads. well it is true thatshe is the loudest but as far as the best,thats not all that true.in fact kelly and michelle sings better than her some times. <br />on this album she doest sing like she does with destiny's child <br />she kind of sounds flat.which maybe because she's finally not trying to out side two certain girls(hint:kelly&michelle) <br />the songs are very meaningful so thats what really saves the album from being another \\"hotcoko\\"/\\"kandi\\"release. <br />
B0007OCG4W|2.0|this movie is ok...don't get me wrong.  but after watching it all i could think was 'wow...i didn't find any of the dialogue between the characters interesting or realistic.'  they're all good actors, but there's too much useless drama dribble in this movie to make it worth the money you paid to watch it.
B000066NW0|1.0|She can say she's punk all she wants.  She can go wear a tie all she wants.  She can win all the awards she wants.  She can let other people write most of her music all she wants.  She can grab the attention of 7th graders all she wants.  She can also grab my brother's attention all she wants.  She can pretend that her songs are really hers and that she wasn't massively aided by people in the studio.  (Look at the insert, \\"written by Lavigne and... [Insert name here]).  She can also say that she plays the guitar.  Looking at the music videos she doesn't really, or plays as least amount of chords as possible.  Well that sums up a lot of it.  Oh yeah, she can say she doesn't suck when in reality, we've already heard this before and it SUCKS VERY VERY VERY HARD.  She can also say this isn't clich, but I think you can guess what I can say about that.
B000286RKW|5.0|Joe Pesci won an Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his part in GoodFellas, a film nominated for six Academy Awards overall including Best Picture. And every accolade attributed to this film is well deserved. With an all-star cast of performers, GoodFellas is one of director Martin Scorsese's greatest productions. Based on the true story of former mobster Henry Hill, GoodFellas begins with his famous quote, \\"As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster...\\" <br /> <br />GoodFellas follows the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), an Irish-Italian American who becomes involved in organized crime at a young age. Quickly rising in stature as a small time gangster, Henry wins the heart of a local Jewish girl, Karen (Lorraine Bracco), despite her parents' objections. Karen, though frightened, is fascinated by Henry's life of crime. He has many friends - rich friends, powerful friends. And nobody messes with him. When they get married, Karen is forced to adjust to the life of a typical mobster's wife... <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Henry's best friends (he and Karen only associate with those connected to the mob) in crime are Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) - two fellow wiseguys with their sights set on bigger and better jobs. When Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy pull together a team that executes the biggest heist in years, their reputations rise fast within the mob hierarchy. But things begin to fall apart when the incompetent and undisciplined men with whom they worked start flaunting cash from the robbery. The three friends are forced to kill off several members of the team in order to avoid raising the suspicions of the police. <br /> <br />But eventually, Henry becomes arrogant and reckless, landing himself in jail. When he gets out, he's careful in his business dealings due to the fact that local mob boss Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino) has his eye on him. Paulie doesn't want Henry to do anything stupid and land himself in jailagain. But in the end, Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy get more than they bargained for when Tommy kills an annoying barfly - unaware that the man he killed was a \\"made man\\". Now, each man must figure out for himself which direction his life will take... <br /> <br />Raw and blunt in its pronouncements, GoodFellas easily holds its own with some of the greatest films of all time. Like any good story, it brings the audience into an unknown world of mystery and seduction. The audience begins to feel the tension along with the characters in the film. That's the mark of a great movie... <br /> <br />Liotta, Pesci, and De Niro all stand out in this epic drama about one man's life as a professional criminal. Through each man, the audience views the perks and the pitfalls of life in the mob as well as the perpetual feeling that one is always looking over his shoulder. GoodFellas doesn't glamorize life in the mob by any means, and those who enjoyed The Godfather will appreciate its contemporary slant on the drug trade to which Don Corleone so vigorously objected. When taking an objective view, GoodFellas stacks up as one of the 100 greatest movies of all time, and it certainly merits the designation of must-see film...  <br /> <br />The DVD Report

B000002P7R|4.0|I agree with many reviewers about the spotty quality of a lot of material.  Neophytes would do better to get the stuff he released in his lifetime, plus First Rays of New Rising Sun.<br /><br />My main reason for buying this was to get some of the tracks previously available on Rainbow Bridge and War Heroes, particularly Tax Free and Pali Gap.  Those two tracks, along with the title track, \\"South Saturn Delta\\", give a slight hint at what Jimi might have done next, had he lived.  For 1971 Jimi was scheduled to record with Gil Evans and with Rahsaan Roland Kirk.  What would those sessions have sounded like????  He also allegedly did some jam sessions with Miles and with Sam Rivers.  I'm convinced that Jimi had not reached his creative peak when he died so prematurely.  Sadly we'll never know, but this collection does give you a slight glimpse, and for that it's valuable.
B00013F35I|3.0|Contrary to the NEW YORK DVD, screen time in the final edition of this show is almost 98% about Springsteen.. WHile in the other DVD each of the E-Street Band members had a relatively good amount of time to shine, in this one The Boss fills the screen almost the whole show. Poor old Nils Lofgren suffers the most, even Roy Bittan is practically left out of the edition... Only Max Weinberg gets a fair amount of screen time. <br /> <br />As for the music itself, it's strong, crispy, energetic as always. Nothing to complain about it. The audience is berserk, sound quality is good, Bruce even plays the piano. Very good.
B00005JM1F|5.0|One of the funniest movies of 2003, Old School is silver screen gold for anyone who lived the life of a college party animal or once inhabited the halls of a beloved fraternity house. In the spirit of Animal House and PCU, Old School brings together a strange amalgam of immature males who wreck havoc on their college campus through wild parties, outrageous pranks, and outright criminal activities. Starring Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Farrell (of Saturday Night Live fame), Old School reads like a great SNL skit. You'll laugh yourself silly over this one. <br /> <br />When Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) returns home early from a business seminar at his extraordinarily boring job, he finds his girlfriend cheating on him. They break up, and he's forced to move out. Moving into an off-campus dwelling at his old school, Mitch's friends Frank Ricard (Will Farrell) and Bernard \\"Beanie\\" Campbell (Vince Vaughn) reminisce about the glory of their fraternity days. The days of all fun and no work... Frank gets married, despite Beanie's attempts to talk him out of it at the altar (during the ceremony), but he quickly grows despondent and longs to enjoy the freedom of his youth once again. Meanwhile, Beanie is a bona fide family man with a successful business, but he too would like to relive the fun of their fraternity days. <br /> <br />Together, the three men decide to turn Mitch's house into a fraternity. They recruit a series of misfit students from around campus - nerds, social rejects, homeless men, and ninety-year-old womanizers. The hazing rituals are beyond description, and the parties are ridiculously outlandish and hilarious. All is going well (for everyone but Frank whose wife catches him running down main street naked) until Dean of Student Affairs Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Piven), a former estranged classmate of the three men, decides to crack down on the fraternity. When he does, the fraternity must pass a series of tests and obstacles in order to retain their charter (and this, the climatic high-point of the film, is also the funniest of all). <br /> <br />Fun from beginning to end, Old School will not win any awards for dramatic scenes or cinematography. But it will win a lot of points as an outright hilarious comedy. If you haven't seen this film, then you really don't know what you're missing. Old School is a classic cult comedy fulfilling the dreams of countless former college fraternity members who ache to relive the greatest party days of their lives. Because it's so funny, Old School is a definite must-see film. Miss it at your own risk... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
0141439807|4.0|Fanny Price, the central character of Mansfield Park is less loveable than Jane Austin's other heroines, but she acts as the pivot point of a far more mature and serious work than her others.  In this critique of 18th century morals and values, Austin attacks society's sacrifice of depth of feeling and honesty to hedonism and personal gain.  In short, anything is acceptable providing the neighbors don't find out.  Despite this, the story moves more slowly than the others and is less a joyful look at society's foibles.<br /><br />Austin has gone to considerable effort to illustrate that over indulgence, lack of responsibility, and a sense of entitlement can ruin a young person's life.  While each of her sponsor's children have been given a superior education and introduced into a society that values wealth, beauty and rank to exclusion of all else, Fanny herself has learned the value of devotion, honesty, and service to others.  It is only with the disastrous behavior of her cousins that the Bertrum family learns how \\"poor\\" they are compared to their young ward.<br /><br />Far more central to the story are the characters of Mary Crawford and her brother, Henry.  Their talents and social abilities encapsulate the essence of what was considered \\"desireable\\" among the upper classes of the 18th century.  Musically inclined, able to carry on a witty conversation, eager to engage in romantic games, mindless of repercussions, they involve themselves in the lives of the Bertrams and their ward, ruining Maria's marriage, almost ruining Edmund's happiness and career, and bringing Tom to physical collapse.  To all of this Fanny's character is the antithesis.  She steadfastly refuses Henry's advances, is not taken in by his clever sister Mary, and grieves over Edmund's ultimate loss of innocence.<br /><br />To some extent, Fanny is a \\"Cinderella\\" figure.  She has even been assigned to an attic room.  Aunt Norris, constantly reminding the girl how lucky she has been to be given the advantages she has been by the Bertrums, also reminds her that she must remember she must always be the last and the least.  Although cousin Edmund is a somewhat dull prince charming, he shares much in common with Fanny, and one can well believe they will live happily-ever-after, once all the hurtles between them have been leaped.  And as always, the \\"bad guys\\" get their cumupence.<br /><br />The book has a lot to say for itself, and despite it's almost 200 years, it has a lot to say to us.he advantages she has been by the Bertrums, also reminds her that she must remember she must always be the last and the least.

B0007GAERG|4.0|After listening several times to \\"The Emancipation of Mimi,\\" I came to the conclusion that I prefer Mariah Carey in a slow groove, as opposed to the one that's trying her best to compete with the likes of Beyonce and Ashanti.  In other words, Miss Carey, I'd rather you return to the style that brought you international acclaim in the first place: the love ballad.<br /><br />Rating each song individually, I've come to the following evaluations:<br /><br />2.5 stars<br />\\"One and Only\\" - Carey tries too hard to capture the hip-hop audience with guest \\"artist\\" Twista on an unspectacular offering.<br /><br />3 stars<br />\\"It's Like That\\" and \\"We Belong Together\\" - The first singles released are rather weak but are getting substantial radio play.<br /><br />3.5 stars<br />\\"Stay the Night\\"<br />\\"Get Your Number\\" - Nice dance track but the Jermaine Dupri \\"rap\\" is unnecessary.<br />\\"Your Girl\\"<br />\\"Shake it Off\\"<br /><br />4 stars<br />\\"Mine Again\\"<br />\\"Circles\\"<br />Joy Ride\\"<br />\\"Fly Like a Bird\\"<br />All these are more in the traditional Carey vein!<br /><br />Surprisingly, the best offerings are \\"Say Somethin'\\" (4.5) and \\"To the Floor\\" (5 stars), both featuring Snoop Dogg and Nelly, respectively, and should have been the first releases. This may be a contradiction to what I said earlier, but these two are a great melding of the old and the new Carey, what she is obviously seeking with mixed results in her \\"emancipation\\".
B0007GAERG|5.0|It is very telling that LA Reid would showcase this new album as \\"the Return of the Voice.\\"  Surely it would be his second great accomplishment to return Mariah Carey to glory after he launched Usher into a SuperStardom atmosphere no one ever expected him to go.  But what is interesting about his approach is that the 'voice' has never really resonated with critics.  While it seemed the world fell in love with Mariah in the 90's when she was belting her way up the charts, critics bashed her for, get this, oversinging.  Of course, this would cause any insecure celebrity, let alone 'Mimi', to morph into the whispering diva that started with the album 'Butterfly'. A first listen of 'The Emancipation' and one can certainly sense a newfound confidence in Mariah.  She indeed is back to a version of her old self, but stunningly hipper.  Three songs are absolute standouts in this collection.  'One and Only', featuring Twista, is probably the coolest Mariah Carey has ever been.  This song has a fantastic beat and Twista's rap is off the hook.  They blend together perfectly.  Another song that is fast rising up the charts, We Belong Together, finds Mariah succesfully covering her 'Always Be My Baby' tracks.  It is sure to be a top ten hit and may even reach number one.  \\"Get Your Number\\" is another gem and features Jermaine Dupri actually singing the chorus.  This is the dance/r&b track that fans have been dying for since HeartBreaker or Honey.  The song is definitely why Dupri has been touring constantly to promote with Mariah.  He knows that 'It's Like That' is a hit, but he also knows that there is more coming his way down the line.  It could potentially be his biggest hit ever and that's saying something.  During most of the album Mariah is pretty subdued, while sometimes she sings higher than we need her to.  It is the rare moments during parts of 'Stay the Night', 'One and Only', and 'Joy Ride', that we actually hear that old Voice. The voice is making a comeback, and maybe it needs to be a little more cultivated to be back fully, but I say if 'Emancipation' can please both critics and fans, it must be something of a comeback for a celebrity who has had a run of bad publicity in recent years.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|One of the more absurd movies of the decade, Napoleon Dynamite nonetheless manages to be a hilarious comedy in its own right. Featuring a unique brand of alienated-teenage humor, the film relies more on its well-timed pauses and character body language than on zinging one-liners. If you enjoy its subtle humor, then Napoleon Dynamite is a film you'll find utterly hilarious. Otherwise, it might cause boredom or outright confusion. The film has a near non-existent storyline, but what it lacks in plot, it makes up for with its witty and hilarious comedy sequences... <br /> <br />Jon Heder plays the title role of Napoleon Dynamite, an estranged and nerdy high school youth living with his grandmother and older brother, Kip (Aaron Ruell), in Preston, Idaho. Sporting a clueless, unchanging facial expression throughout the movie, Napoleon simply glides through life, getting kicked around, pushed into lockers, and watching life pass by. When a Spanish student named Pedro (Efren Ramirez) moves into town, Napoleon befriends the social outcast. The two drone on and on about myriad subjects, such as who to take to the upcoming dance. Fellow socially-challenged student Deb (Tina Majorino) becomes the object of their affections. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Kip trolls the Internet chat rooms in search of women, and Napoleon's Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) moves in with the boys while their grandmother is away. Uncle Rico's own exploits add to the hilarity of a film with little in the way of substance, at least until Pedro decides to run for class president against the school's most popular girl, Summer (Haylie Duff). Now, Napoleon and Pedro must work against all odds to win the school election...  <br /> <br />The true strength of Napoleon Dynamite is its clan of outrageous characters, characters that are so outrageously ridiculous that every viewer can point out the mirror image of that character from his own high school yearbook or current life experience. The arrested social development ofNapoleon and his friends are amplified for effect within the film's context, drawing the viewer into a Lord of the Flies world of Darwinian adolescence. The humor is sometimes subtle, and Napoleon Dynamite is not to be confused with an Academy Award winning drama. But if you like stupid movies such Dumb And Dumber, then this is the film for you. <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite is a unique comedy which pushes the boundaries of plot-challenged, immature filmmaking. In short, you'll love it. Most of the characters are so pathetic, you'll find yourself laughing at them simply because they exist. One of the biggest surprises of 2004, Napoleon Dynamite is an oddball comedy that definitely ranks as a must-see movie...  <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is Mariah's best CD since \\"Rainbow\\". Her voice sounds terrific and most of the songs are upbeat and fun. The best are \\"It's Like That\\", \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Stay The Night\\" and \\"Your Girl\\". They're different from anything else Mariah has done, in a good way. The entire CD is excellent and definitely won't disappoint any Mariah fans.
B00006L83N|5.0|I had the chance to break in a brand new stereo receiver and speakers with this amazing album, but anyway, onto the review. <br />This is almost my favorite progressive rock/metal, right next to Images and Words, and Lateralus. And if you do not own those albums, then you should be shunned from society. Anywho, this album if you did not know, is a concept album. It is based on the Illiad and The Odyseey, which if you dont know what they are, go back to school. It follows tales of the battle of the Trojan war and then in the epic 24 minute title track tells about the long journey home. I could rate rate the tracks, but there is really not a track that is not a 10 in its own right. <br />Ah, why not I'll rate them. <br /> <br /> <br />~Inferno(Unleash the Fire~Starts off with some shredding, Yngwie style, but cleaner sounding. This will make you question any other music you've ever been into. The drumming and bass is tight.10/10 <br />~Wicked~Easily one of the heaviest on here. Starts off with a montster of a riff.Keyboard and guitar solo are simply amazing, as in every other song.10/10 <br />~Incantations of the Aprentice~Starts of with some brass instruments building into some heavy keyboard backed double bass drumming and metal riffing. Freaking Sweet.10/10 <br />~Accolade II~Easily my favorite on here. Starts of with an orchestral vibe, then breaks into some sweet progressive metal. <br />At one point in this song, everything breaks down into a vocal solo which leads into a little semi-solo. The highlight of the album, including this solo. <br />~King of Terrors~Not my favoirte, but still better than anything on modern radio.The drumming is again amazing. Same with everything else. 9/10 <br />~The Turning~Really cool intro. With a solo right of the bat to melt your face away.10/10 <br />~Awakenings~Slower Tool-esque start, with a cool sinth intro after that. Very time signature shifting song with a sweet guitar lick before vocals kick in.9/10 <br />~The Odyseey~Starts off very very orchestral, and is very long. Not in a bad way. Has a few differant breakdowns for higly skilled soloing. I love the lyrics about returning to Ithica from the war. My Second Favorite on here.10/10 <br />~Masaquerde~A nice ending song.8/10 <br /> <br />Greatest Prog Album of the new century, might rival Tommy and The Wall in concept albums. Go get it NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!
B00005JMJG|3.0|After an hour I wanted to scream, \\"OK I GOT IT ALREADY, NOW WHERE'S THE MOVIE???\\"... The 'erasing' procedure goes on and on and on.  So the movie boils down to \\"boy gets girl, girl 'erases' boy, boy agrees to 'erase' girl, boy changes his mind in mid-erase, etc.\\" I was hoping there would be more of a story.  Instead, it's mainly about the erasing with some \\"relationship insights\\" mixed in.  The positive aspect of the movie is the unique camera work and effects.  Too bad that couldn't have been harnessed for a real story like James Joyce's Ulysses.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|Originally released in 1984, The Karate Kid took the nation by storm. A true summer blockbuster, The Karate Kid capitalized on the traditional teen romantic comedy genre with the addition of martial arts action sequences. No doubt, the film was responsible for a countless number of kids joining up to take martial arts classes. But more importantly, The Karate Kid is fun and entertaining family film...<br /><br />Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and his mother Lucille (Randee Heller) move to California from New Jersey, where Daniel has a difficult time making new friends. Striking up a romantic friendship with Ali Mills (Elisabeth Shue), a rich girl who previously dated the popular Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), he incurs Johnny's envious wrath. When Daniel is about to get beat up yet again, the super at the apartment building where he lives, a Japanese immigrant named Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita), steps in and beats up Johnny and his friends. Mystified, Daniel learns that Mr. Miyagi is a martial arts expert. He begs to become an understudy, and Mr. Miyagi reluctantly agrees.<br /><br />Following several weeks of training and conditioning which Daniel doesn't understand (waxing cars and painting houses), he's ready to quit. But Mr. Miyagi reveals the depth of the effect the training has had on Daniel's skills as a martial artist. With Johnny and his Cobra Kai friends continually threatening Daniel, Mr. Miyagi strikes a deal with Cobra Kai Sensei John Kreese (Martin Kove). Kreese agrees that his students will not lay a hand on Daniel until after the upcoming All-Valley Karate Championship. At the championship, the foes will decide their dispute once and for all... Will Daniel finally get the bullies off his back? Will he win the girl in the end? The Karate Kid has all the elements of a smash hit...<br /><br />More than any other, the true star of The Karate Kid is Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) whose grandfatherly ways and deadly fighting abilities earned him a place within the hearts of movie viewers around the world. Exhibiting all the characteristics of a noble individual, Miyagi is a throw back to the idyllic days of knights and chivalry. Taking the young LaRusso under his wing, the two form a bond that transcends age and race, and when Daniel overcomes the obstacles in his young life, Mr. Miyagi is there to smile...<br /><br />A masterpiece of the 1980s teen drama, The Karate Kid penetrated pop culture with its \\"sand on, sand off\\" catch phrases and kids imitating the \\"crane kick\\". Although not in the same category as Academy Award winning dramas, The Karate Kid nevertheless holds its own as good, clean entertainment the entire family can enjoy. All those countless movie viewers can't be wrong, can they? Because of its original screenplay and infusion into the American pop culture, The Karate Kid is a definite must-see movie...<br /><br />The DVD Report
B000005RS7|5.0|This is a phenomenal album right from the first to last track.  Kate does not falter on this album (this her most commercially successful - i believe).  Songs are all intelligent (no surprise) and range from religion to parental love.  Some songs are downright eerie (under ice is a song about skating and breaking through getting trapped underneath - it can still make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up) and disturbing (waking the witch seems to be about a girl being trapped in a dream that she can't wake from and in the dream she is a witch being dunked into water as torture).  Most are beautiful (hello earth, and dream of sheep, morning fog) but all are masterpieces.  <BR>The bonus tracks are almost all just as perfect.  The remixes of Running up that hill and big sky i am not thrilled with (just not a fan of remixes).  But the crowning glory of the bonus tracks for me is My Lagan Love.  Kate Bush acepella (I know i didn't spell it right) amazing!!!!

B0000062GK|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Joe's for many years and though it's tough to pick a favorite CD among his many stellar releases, this seems to be the one I reach for more often than not.

B00005PJ8O|5.0|Nominated for ten Academy Awards, and winner of seven including Best Picture, Patton is one of the most inspirational and interesting biographies ever produced on the big screen. Cast in the title role, George C. Scott won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role, but refused to accept the award because he didn't consider himself in competition with other actors. With brilliant direction, cinematography, visual effects, and an original musical score (by Jerry Goldsmith) - themselves all nominated for Academy Awards - Patton stacks up as one of the best films of all time from any genre... <br /> <br />Patton follows the life of George S. Patton (George C. Scott), famous Allied tank commander from World War II. Beginning with his exploits in North Africa, Patton follows the career of this bombastic general through the D-Day invasion (in which he would act as a decoy), the Battle of the Bulge, and the liberation of Germany. Throughout the process, viewers are privy to the ongoing behind-the-scenes actions of a man famous for his temper and infamous among his peers for his insubordination.  <br /> <br />Along the way, Patton must learn to deal with his contemporaries, men such as General Dwight D. Eisenhower, General Omar Bradley (Karl Malden), and Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (Michael Bates). Despite his display of military genius in the field of battle (garnering the fear of his German enemies), Patton is relieved from his post as Occupation Commander of Germany because of the many faults he exhibits. A military historian who believed he was destined for greatness throughout the ages, Patton loved war. In fact, once the war ended, he died within a few months when he was killed in a car accident... <br /> <br />George C. Scott turns in a memorable performance as the large-than-life Patton. With an overpowering personality and a domineering will, George Patton led his men to victory in one of the most pivotal wars for freedom the world has ever witnessed. Politically-incorrect by every standard of today's measure, the real Patton wouldn't last a minute in today's military. Ironic, because that same military would acknowledge him as one of the greatest generals of its hallowed past! Nevertheless, Patton's legacy endures through our memories and through this film, and the lessons of his life continue to inspire people to this day (people who hopefully use a bit more tact and subtlety in asserting their desires)... <br /> <br />Overall, Patton is a blockbuster film even by today's standards. Despite vast improvements in the realm of filmmaking, Patton (released in 1970) remains unrivaled in its portrayal of one of America's greatest heroes. The battle scenes are especially realistic, and decades before Saving Private Ryan, they vividly illustrated the serious horrors of war. One of the greatest films of the 20th Century, written about one of the greatest figures of the 20th Century, Patton is a definite must-see film for any serious aficionado of movies... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00000DHR0|5.0|I have owned this Celine Dion Christmas CD since it was released for Christmas 1998. I love it and listen to it every year during CHristmas. Her voice is beautiful and I love her version of O' Holy Night, and I love some of her original songs escpecially Christmas Eve. My whole family enjoys this album. Sometimes we even listen to it when it is not Christmas. Celine is great and is a wonderful singer.
B00005JMX6|5.0|Great movie.   Not a gag movie.  Definitaly a derivative of Risky Business and imo actually surpasses that movie. <br /> <br />Elisha C. is stunnning.  Emile H. is pretty funny and charming and his sidekicks are hilarious.   Reminds me of my friends that at that age. <br /> <br />Anyway, rent, buy but see it.  I loved it and just laughed and smiled the whole way thru...when I was drooling over E. Cuthbert.
0767812387|5.0|I agree with many of the other reviews. This movie is out of this world...it's so full of fun and love and enjoyment of life. You can't put it away. I'm wearing my CD out already (if it's possible) and will probably have to buy another. I haven't stopped watching it since I bought it. Vanessa was always a good actress to me but my focus is--of course--on the sexy, wonderful smiling Chayanne. His performance is so poignant, you hurt for him as things don't seem to work out as he'd hoped with his father and with Ruby. Yes, the movie is somewhat predictable but still I hang on to every word.    I vaguely remember him from the 100 most beautiful people in the People Magazine in the early nineties but had no idea who he was at the time. This movie introduced me to the latin music world and wow!!!! What a fun world!! I don't understand a lick of the language but who cares! It's awesome. The white haired singer in the movie--WHO IS SHE??!! I keep returning to that scene where the room just dances together to her song. I've never seen anything like this. I can't say enough about this movie. Although it is sad that it didn't get the credit it should have. I remember the movie coming out but wasn't much interested until a friend introduced it to me only a week ago.    Now I'm ordering two of Chayanne's CDs and the Dance with me soundtrack. The song with Chayanne and Vanessa is so romantic and sweet. I agree--there's something almost innocent about this movie. And in a world where everything is so overtly obvious, both sexually and violently, this is a movie that won't be far from me. It makes me believe love is possible outside the racial barriers (I'm an AA woman by the way). I want my own Rafael! LOL    There's only ONE thing I'm not happy about and that is this DVD doesn't have the extra features that are out these days. It's obvious that there are a lot of scenes that were pulled from the final cut. I'd have loved to see them practicing the dancing, cast interviews, all the little things we love about purchasing the DVD version of a movie. Hey--it's not too late, just give us a special edition DVD with these features. Trust me, I'll buy it.    If you haven't seen it, get the movie. It'll be well worth your time. And I'm taking Latin dancing lessons too. I wanna dance--Dance With Me? ;)
6305508550|5.0|If Seinfeld is a show about nothing, then Office Space is the hit comedy about one man's \\"dream of doing nothing\\"... Arguably the best work-related comedy ever written, Office Space follows the life of Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a computer programmer in his late-20's who hates his mind-numbing job at Initech Corporation where he updates bank software for the year 2000 switch. <br /> <br />Peter is joined by fellow computer programmers Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman). All four men are plagued by the condescending, soul-killing management techniques of their boss, Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole) who begins every utterance with a protracted \\"Yeah...\\" Completely unhappy with his job and his romantic relationship, Peter whines about his life with his co-workers while drinking coffee at local restaurant, Chotchkie's, where he's infatuated with a beautiful waitress, Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), who is forced by her boss to wear \\"pieces of flair\\". Samir and Michael encourage Peter to ask her out, but Peter is too paralyzed by life to do anything about it. <br /> <br />All that changes, however, when Peter visits a hypnotherapist with his girlfriend. In the act of sending Peter into a state of total relaxation, the hypnotherapist suffers a heart attack. His untimely death leaves Peter in a perpetual state of relaxation, providing his life with a much needed injection of enjoyment. The next morning, Peter sleeps through work, dumps his girlfriend, then goes and asks Joanna out to lunch. Peter and Joanna hit it off, and he reveals to her that he's simply going to stop going to work. <br /> <br />After a good week or so of neglecting his job, two independent consultants - Bob Slydell (John McGinley) and Bob Porter (Paul Willson) - reveal to Peter that he's being promoted to the upper ranks of management. Meanwhile, his studious co-workers Samir and Michael are slated to be canned. Armed with this insider information, Peter approaches Michael about concocting a previously mentioned computer program to take the remainders of every bank transaction at Initech and funnel them into a private account owed by Peter, Samir, and Michael. Michael is reluctant until he finds out that he's going to be fired.  <br /> <br />As the two set out to convince Samir that their plan will work, resident office weirdo Milton Waddams (Stephen Root) is in the process of having his paycheck stopped by the consultants who uncover the fact that Milton was fired several years earlier but is still being paid. When Bill Lumbergh moves Milton's desk into the basement, he whispers that he will set the place on fire. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, long-time corporate cog Tom Smykowski (Richard Riehle) experiences the dream of a lifetime when he's badly injured by a drunk driver. Fresh off a seven-figure settlement, and in possession of his prototype \\"jump to conclusions mat,\\" Tom tells Peter to hang in there, that life has a lot of good things in store for those who wait. While attending a party for Tom, Samir and Michael grow nervous when Tom's lawyer reveals that white collar criminals go to federal \\"pound-me-in-the-ass\\" prison where they better \\"beat someone up or become someone's bitch\\" on the first day.  <br /> <br />Office Space is one laugh after another, and the heroes' nefarious plan works surprisingly well until it hits a glitch. When the scheme devised by Peter, Michael, and Samir goes up in smoke, Milton decides to create some smoke of his own... <br /> <br />The brainchild of King of the Hill and Beavis & Butthead creator Mike Judge, Office Space will leave you in absolute stitches. Funny from beginning to end, with a plot mysteriously similar to Superman 3, this is one movie that anyone who's ever worked a job from hell (and haven't we all?) needs to see at least once. But if you've ever spent a day trapped in the confines of an office cubicle, you need to see this movie at least twelve times... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
0739313126|4.0|I don't think anyone who tryies to take this book as \\"gospel\\" will enjoy it. I don't think that is the intention of the book. I really enjoyed the story and found myself captivated by the plot. It was very well read. For those who enjoy a murder/mystery - you will enjoy this book.
0780020685|5.0|The classic praise of this movie is true - the theme is timeless, the characters are deep, the cinemetography is groundbreaking.  Somehow what gets lost is that Kurosawa just knows how to tell a good story.  Everything that is built on top of that is just bonus. <br /> <br />Toshiro Mifune comes alive as the farmer turned Samurai, who fights for acceptance from a group he idolizes.  He captures the essence of the farmer/samurai conflict in his person.   <br /> <br />Perhaps the one mistake I made was seeing this before watching the Magnificent Seven.  The great western pales in comparison to this masterpiece. <br /> <br />The other challenge for some is pacing.  Those expecting a pure rock 'em sock 'em action flick will be disappointed.  Building a masterpiece takes time.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Brainchild of cinematic genius Steven Spielberg, The Goonies is a thrilling fantasy adventure film for younger audiences - although adults will find it enjoyable as well. Foreshadowing the success of the Harry Potter films, The Goonies involves a series of tests and obstacles that a group of young kids must overcome in order to save the day. In a lot of ways, the film is like an Indiana Jones for kids - produced in such a way that kids can envision or fantasize about being in just such a situation. <br /> <br />The film follows the exploits of a neighborhood group of kids who call themselves The Goonies. Upset that they will soon have to part ways because of the forced commercial development of their neighborhood, the kids are enjoying what they believe will be one of their last meetings together.  <br /> <br />But while Mikey, Chunk, Mouth, and Data (the nicknames of the Goonies respectively) are exploring Mikey's attic, they find a treasure map hidden in the back of an old picture frame. Purportedly, the map leads to the long lost treasure of the famous pirate \\"One-Eyed\\" Willy. Banding together with Mikey's older brother Brandon and two neighborhood girls, Andy and Stef, the group sets out to uncover the pirate's vast riches and thus save their homes from the wrath of the wrecking ball. <br /> <br />But a small problem stands in their way. The treasure map's starting point rests underneath an old abandoned house used as a hideout by the notorious Fratelli crime family. Brothers Jake and Francis, coupled with their deformed yet gentle brother and mean Mama Fratelli, are quite an intimidating force. When the Goonies manage to uncover the entrance to the cave that harbors their treasure, Chunk is left behind. The Fratelli's viciously interrogate the boy in an effort to find out what happened to his friends. But it takes a freak accident (spilled water falling down the hole in the fireplace) before they find One-Eyed Willy's secret passage. <br /> <br />With the Fratelli family hot on their heals, the Goonies must pass through a series of mental and physical obstacles set up centuries before by pirates intent on keeping undesirables away from their precious bounty. Interspersed in the action is a number of clever and humorous one-liners that add to the overall audience enjoyment of the film.  <br /> <br />In the end, the kids discover One-Eyed Willy's monstrous treasure. But can they stave off the greedy ambitions of the Fratelli family? Will they manage to save their neighborhood with the newfound treasure? You'll have to watch to find out, and trust me, this movie is a lot of fun... <br /> <br />Each of the stars contributes to the film in his own way. Chunk provides many moments of comic relief with his endless whining, and Data's constant deployment of quirky homemade inventions, although stretching the limits of reality, are a welcome addition to a fantasy adventure film tailored for a young audience.  <br /> <br />With the introduction of The Goonies DVD, an entirely new generation can discover the thrill and wonder of this instant cinema classic. Given its wide range of appeal to audiences of all ages and the exciting quest for hidden treasure, The Goonies passes the test as a definite must-see film. If you haven't seen it, or even worse - if your children have been deprived of seeing it - then I highly recommend renting this one... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00008973Q|5.0|This stands as my favorite Kurosawa movie.  It's an epic retelling of MacBeth, cast in feudal Japan.  A father unsuccessfully plans his succession, and Chaos (the Japanese definition of Ran) results.  His sons, instigated by a vanquised foe turned wife, start to fight, and everything goes downhill. <br /> <br />The greatness is in the details.  Meticulously planned scenes provide explanation by showing, rather than telling.  Facial expressions carry more weight than words.  The screen placement of characters provides insights as well.  To appreciate everything, it helps to watch the movie twice - once as is, and again with the voiceover. <br /> <br />This remains one of the greatest movies ever made - the crowning achievement of the great master.  It's a movie to own and see multiple times, rather than rent and return.  Don't let DVD format particulars dissuade you - the word masterpiece is not overused here.
B00003CXAT|4.0|An adventure 65 million years in the making... such is the tagline for Jurassic Park, the onscreen adaptation of Michael Crichton's wildly successful novel about the human-aided return of dinosaurs to planet Earth. One of Steven Spielberg's greatest achievements, Jurassic Park was, and remains, a special effects masterpiece unrivaled by its peers. Dinosaurs roam the plains and scour the forests against the backdrop of conductor John Williams's original score (some of the best music of his career, which is saying a lot). Unlike the Godzilla movies of years past, you can't see human hands or construction paper props in the background of this movie. The computer generated creatures are so amazingly animated, that you'll finish the film believing that Jurassic Park is a real life destination... <br /> <br />Dr. Alan Grant's (Sam Neill) life is dinosaur bones and the study of the various ancient reptiles that once dominated the Earth. He and his colleague Dr. Elli Sattler (Laura Dern) spend their days excavating the barren hills of South Dakota and loving every minute of it. But when Dr. Grant is approached by the eccentric multimillionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) in regard to touring \\"something of great interest,\\" the man's world of dinosaurs becomes more realistic than he ever thought possible. <br /> <br />Hammond's creation is an isolated island called \\"Jurassic Park\\" where his company uses dinosaur DNA extracted from mosquitoes encased in amber during the Jurassic period many millennia before to clone dinosaurs. Prior to opening his park to the public, Hammond wants to take a number of experts on a tour of the facilities, among them are Grant and Sattler, a lawyer named Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), and a mathametican/philosopher - Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). When everyone but the lawyer expresses great reservations about the very idea of cloning dinosaurs (especially the carnivores), not to mention the safety concerns for an aspiring theme park,Hammond insists on putting their fears to rest personally. <br /> <br />But John Hammond's dream goes terribly awry when a disgruntled computer programmer, Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight of Seinfeld fame), compromises the island's security systems in order to smuggle some dinosaur embryos off the island, where a competing corporation has offered him a handsome monetary reward. Nedry's death, and the inadequate security systems of Jurassic Park, put the dangerous T-Rex and the lightning fast raptors on level ground with the island's human inhabitants. Now, Hammond and his guests no longer spend their idle time assessing the merits of Jurassic Park, but instead spend every waking minute fighting for their survival...  <br /> <br />You'll be hard pressed to find a film which rivals the brilliant special effects of Jurassic Park. The Star Wars films are the only movies even in the same league. But Jurassic Park also offers an interesting and compelling story, lots of action, and reams of suspense. Even an occasional lawyer joke helps to break up the intensity... Jurassic Park has it all. A summer blockbuster by a director who almost single-handedly invented summer blockbusters, Jurassic Park is a definite must-see movie. If you shy away from excessively commercial films, then make an exception for this one. I promise, you won't be disappointed... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00012QM8G|5.0|Powerful, moving and thought provoking. I never wanted to see this movie initially, because I knew I couldn't sit still for three hours in a movie theatre. After all these years, when it finally came out on DVD, i'm so glad I did. It seems that a lot of people need to learn from this film that war for ANY purpose will never to justified if it costs the death of so many innocents. I usually like to review movies that I can make a little fun of, but this movie was so  - well, there isn't any feeling you can describe after watching this movie. There nothing that any reviewer can tell you without ruining the movie for you. You'll understand after the movie. It's no wonder Steven got the oscar for this one!
0790731940|4.0|A 1990's Western comedy featuring Mel Gibson, Maverick was a breath of fresh air when first appeared in theaters. The film doesn't take itself so seriously as many films with a Western setting tend to do. Based on the 1950's television series by the same name in which James Garner had a starring role, Maverick is a uniquely clever and entertaining adventure comedy... <br /> <br />When Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson) needs $25,000 to enter a winner-take-all poker tournament, he travels through towns en route to the tournament in the hopes of winning every dollar he needs. But he quickly encounters Angel (Alfred Molina), a roughneck poker player in his own right who tries to kill Maverick (his attempt inevitably fails). <br /> <br />Along the way, Maverick meets up with Ms. Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) - a slick, conniving poker player who picks Maverick's pocket following a brief romantic encounter. When Maverick catches her, he forces her to wash his shirt as punishment. Shrinking his designer shirt, Annabelle runs off to catch a riverboat with Maverick running after her. After boarding the boat, the two are joined by Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) - a kind, retired sheriff famous throughout the West. Cooper's chivalry and hospitality greatly contrast with Maverick's brisk demeanor when it comes to dealing with Ms. Bransford. <br /> <br />As the three travel cross country, they face a series of pitfalls such as a dead coach driver who almost runs their coach off the top of a cliff, a showdown with hundreds of Indians, and Maverick's financial dealings with an Archduke from Russia. Separated in the confusion, the three eventually meet again on the Riverboat Lauren Belle, home of the championship poker game hosted by the riverboat's owner Commodore Duvall. Making use of his quick wit, Maverick raises the extra cash he needs to join the poker game (as well as a few thousand extra for Annabelle Bransford). Commodore Duvall puts Marshal Zane Cooper in charge of guarding the $500,000 in entry fees for the tournament in which Angel also happens to be a participant.  But in addition to beating Angel, Maverick faces other obstacles of even greater challenge... <br /> <br />Overall, Maverick is great entertainment. The acting is superb on all fronts with standout performances by Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner. Each of the main characters creates a likeable persona. And what makes this movie a must-see (because the plot leaves much to be desired) is the ability of the on-screen characters to create a personal connection with the audience. Several of the scenes in this film are absolutely hilarious, such as the ones with Joseph (Graham Greene). Maverick isn't the type of movie that will win Academy Awards or leave one pondering the fundamental principles of the universe, but it is a whole lot of fun. And if you want to do is laugh, give this movie a try... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B000067J24|4.0|Okay, unfortunately, it's not that kind of movie. However, it's a great romantic comedy - which also as a surprise actor (Harold Perrineau - Lost, Oz, Matrix Revolutions) as a drag queen. Penelope Cruz stars as Isabella Oliveira (even her character's name is sexy!) who has a problem of making love to her hubby due to her motion sickness . Well, if that description doesn't get you in the buying mood, I don't know what will. Anyway, Hubby gets sick of the woman on top position, and basically cheats on her. Then the fun starts.   I saw this movie years ago, and it was so good, I just had to have it. It's the perfect movie to watch if you wanna make a move on that hard to get gal!   It's a nice mixture of romance, comedy, slow Spanish music and a little black magic. Also, it's got a lot of my favourite aphrodisiac, food.     Acting - 3/5   Plot - 3.5/5   Comedy - 3.5/5   Romance - 4.5/5   Magic - 5/5   Chilli - 5/5     Overall - 4/5
B00004RFCM|5.0|Based on the bestselling novel by Candace Bushnell, the HBO original series Sex And The City took the television world by storm following its release in the summer of 1998. Following the exploits of four young and educated female friends living and working in New York City, the show revolves around the various relationships and life problems experienced by each member of the group. Sporting an experienced and talented cast, the show has developed a strong, borderline fanatic following... <br /> <br />Sarah Jessica Parker (the de facto lead character of the show) stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a popular sex columnist for a local newspaper who travels in numerous Manhattan social circles. Carrie is engaged in a tempestuous on-again, off-again relationship with a mystery man always referred to as \\"Mr. Big\\". The young urban professional shares her life with three best friends who have similarly interesting jobs - Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon), a lawyer tired of being single given the societal ramifications; Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), a promiscuous publicist who enjoys non-exclusive relationships; and Charlotte McDougal (Kristin Davis), an art museum curator who is relatively less open about her sexuality... Together, the women seek each other's advice on the ever-present and varying predicaments in which they find their romantic relationships...  <br /> <br />The Sex And The City (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere in which the four stars make a pact at Miranda's birthday party that they will start having sex like men (i.e. without feeling or attachment). Charlotte is skeptical of the idea, but Carrie takes to the idea immediately by sleeping with her ex-boyfriend. Meanwhile, Miranda goes out with Carrie's friend Skipper while Samantha and Carrie develop new relationships of their own... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include \\"Bay of Married Pigs\\" in which Carrie is set up by her married friends with a man intent ongetting married himself (meanwhile, all four women feel the societal pressures to get married), and \\"The Monogamists\\" in which each of the four women deals with personal issues involving exclusive/non-exclusive relationships of varying degrees... <br /> <br />Below is a list of episodes included on the Sex And The City (Season 1) DVD: <br /> <br />Episode 1 (Sex and the City) <br />Episode 2 (Models and Mortals)  <br />Episode 3 (Bay of Married Pigs)  <br />Episode 4 (Valley of the Twenty-Something Guys) <br />Episode 5 (The Power of Female Sex)  <br />Episode 6 (Secret Sex)  <br />Episode 7 (The Monogamists)  <br />Episode 8 (Three's a Crowd)  <br />Episode 9 (The Turtle and The Hare)  <br />Episode 10 (The Baby Shower)  <br />Episode 11 (The Drought)  <br />Episode 12 (Oh Come, All Ye Faithful)  <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00000K0DT|5.0|That's right, Spacey was noticed after winning the Support Actor award in this moved ( I thought he should have gotten another award for \\"Swimming with sharks\\" ). The good point of this movie was it's totally original ( for it's time ) script but the bad point is that you can only see it once.  <br />In the movies, the most rememberable scene is the finale. Let me just say, without spoiling it for you or without any exagerration, this is the single most unbelivable ending you will ever see. Compared to this ending, every other movie is just a blown matchstick.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|One of the more interesting movies of 2003, Love Actually is a hilarious, romantic, emotional rollercoaster chronicling the effects of love on an interconnecting web of individuals. Filled with a number of memorable scenes, yet completely ignored by the Academy Awards, Love Actually is the type of film enjoyed by a wide array of people. I have yet to meet anyone who didn't like it, which is saying a lot considering this could fall under the category of \\"chick flick\\". But what makes Love Actually a successful film is its ability to identity with each audience member on a personal level. Each character is easy to relate to, and the multiple storylines are surprisingly easy to follow. <br /> <br />Starring a plethora of Hollywood stars and starlets (Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, etc), Love Actually follows the lives of various loosely connected characters as they struggle to deal with their love lives in the hectic month leading up to Christmas. Set in London, England, the film is a collage of various lives. The central character is the world's most eligible bachelor, the new Prime Minister named David (Hugh Grant), a powerful man who falls in love with his newly hired personal assistant Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), but can barely summon the courage to tell her how he feels.  <br /> <br />The film also follows the life of the Prime Minister's older sister Karen (Emma Thompson), a woman struggling with her husband Harry's (Alan Rickman) possible infidelity with an office co-worker named Mia (Heike Makatsch) who she knows is after him. Meanwhile, Karen confides in her male friend Daniel (Liam Neeson) who is concerned about the strange behavior of his young son, who he later finds out is in love with a young girl in his class - a girl who will soon move to the United States. Rounding out the storylines are a writer who catches his girlfriend cheating and moves away to France where he find new love, a secretary who questions her love affair with an office co-worker she's wanted for years, a photographer smitten with his best friend's new wife, and a pair of porn stars who develop a relationship after filming a number of scenes together (many of these sequences are hilarious). To top it all off, one young man moves to Wisconsin were he believes girls will stand in line to make love to him. Love Actually features a multitude of eccentric and lovable characters the audience gets to know, and each character crosses paths in the final moments of the film, projecting a very uplifting message about life and relationships. <br /> <br />But the show stealer of Love Actually is Billy Mack (Bill Nighy), an aging rock star desperate to climb back to the top of the charts. He achieves his goal by means of a wildly outlandish and funny personality that puts him on radio and TV shows everywhere and leads to his indescribable song \\"Christmas Is All Around\\" taking the country by storm.  <br /> <br />With a likeable cast of characters, and a multiplicity of viewpoints (pessimistic, optimistic, young & old, etc.), Love Actually is a refreshing film boasting a little bit of everything. It's a film that will make you laugh, make you sad, and in general, provide you with a good feeling when it's all over. For that reason, Love Actually is a definite must-see film. Don't hesitate to rent this one... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00003CXWV|5.0|Y'know, I'm not a BIG fan of biopics, but the real life story of George Jung was an extremely pleasant surprise - why? Because the story and theme hit you hard. This is backed up with the best acting I've seen from Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz ever! Amazingly, the whole story just had a good ensemble. There weren't many negative points about the movie. I mean it's not filled with action or sex, but it's a great drama that any serious movie goer needs to see.   What's it about? Guy discovers coke, gets rich and high off it, then loses it all. There's a lesson in this one people!    Acting - 5/5   Plot - 5/5   Gratuitous Nudity - 1/5   How to inhale cocaine tutorial - 2/5  Overall - 5/5
B00003CXB2|5.0|Based on the writings of T.E. Lawrence, Lawrence Of Arabia is widely considered one of the greatest films of the twentieth century. All-star director David Lean works with an extremely talented cast that includes Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness, Omar Sharif, and Anthony Quinn. Nominated for ten Academy Awards, and winner of seven including Best Picture, Lawrence Of Arabia is a true film for the ages that no movie buff can afford to miss... <br /> <br />British Lt. T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is a military malcontent stationed in North Africa during World War I. Unexcited in his current assignment of coloring maps, he's thrilled when he learns that he's being reassigned as a British observer to King Feisal (Alec Guinness). Leader of a ragtag band of Arab rebels, King Feisal intends to overthrow the government of the Ottoman Empire (aligned against the British), oppressive rulers who dominate his land. And with the aid of T.E. Lawrence, he might well manage to pull it off... <br /> <br />As Lawrence spends more time with his nomad friends from the Arabian peninsula, their cause of self-determination becomes his own. Working together, Lawrence and King Feisal's armies win victories against great odds, successfully sabotage enemy railroad supply lines, and successfully cross a barren desert where the odds of survival were thought to be nil. Along the way, journalist Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy) catalogues Lawrence's exploits for an eager and admiring British public who read anything news related that concerns the exotic 'Lawrence of Arabia'. It's as if the British soldier were King Arthur himself. As King Feisal comes closer to giving birth to a new nation, T.E. Lawrence becomes as famous as any member of the British royal family... <br /> <br />Employing a colorful cast of characters, breathtaking cinematography, and exotic Middle-Eastern locations, Lawrence Of Arabia is an epic of monumental proportions. Illustrating one man's fight for freedom alongside noble tribesmen fighting for self-determination against an empire that's ruled their families for hundreds of years, the film is rivaled by few of its peers. Modern in its subject matter, Lawrence Of Arabia pays an amazing resemblance to its contemporaries in its tackling of exotic locales and larger than life enterprises. Films such as Ben-Hur, Cleopatra, Spartacus, and The Ten Commandments set the tone for their era of film making, and Lawrence Of Arabia answered the call... <br /> <br />Sporting an Oscar award-winning musical score and colorful set designs, Lawrence Of Arabia takes its viewers back in time to the era in which these events occurred. Few films have such an influential effect. With a critically acclaimed performance in his role as the title character, Peter O'Toole strengthens the film with the mastery of his craft. In short, Lawrence Of Arabia is one of the best films ever produced, and it's a definite must-see movie... <br /> <br />The DVD Report

B00004TDTO|5.0|Steven Spielberg's breakout film, Jaws is the quintessential summer blockbuster, creating all the horror, thrills, suspense, and special effects you would expect from such a film. Not excessively violent or gruesome like traditional horror films, Jaws nonetheless manages to create an icy frost in every viewer's veins. Based on the true story of a great white shark which terrorized the shores of New Jersey in the summer of 1916, Jaws is an ingenious adaptation of Peter Benchley's best-selling novel inspired by the incident. Jaws tells the story of man's eternal struggle against nature, a story so compelling it captures the imagination of every generation who hears it - from 1916 to 1975 to the present day... <br /> <br />Jaws takes place in the small New England beach resort of Amity Island, the perfect summer getaway for Northeastern tourists. But this Normal Rockwell community paradise is about to be turned upside down. Late one night, a young couple decides to go swimming. But when the woman's mangled body is washed ashore the next morning, it's clear to local authorities that she isn't a typical drowning victim. The medical examiner informs Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) that the woman could have been the victim of a shark attack, but Amity Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) refuses to speculate, fearing that public knowledge of a shark attack would kill the local economy. <br /> <br />When another shark attacks occurs, this time is broad daylight, the incident draws shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to the area. Working with Chief Brody, Hooper postulates that a great white shark is responsible for the attacks, and the swimming population is in great danger. Meanwhile, a shark hunter named Quint offers to find and kill the shark for $10,000, but Mayor Vaughn believes that price is too high. More and more beach combers will have to be slaughtered before he'll agree to acknowledge the seriousness of the problem, and when the authorities finally decide to go after the great white, the really danger is only beginning... <br /> <br />With brilliant direction and state-of-the-art special effects (satisfactory even by today's standards), Jaws is a true edge-of-your-seat thriller wrought with suspense. The unknown is masterfully woven throughout the movie with a crescendo effect that keeps the audience guessing until the end. Like any good story, the shark is never shown in the opening scenes. Instead, the movie begins with an attack in near darkness. The shark is alluded to... Even when someone is attacked in daylight, the audience is only privy to an exposed fin and the blood of the victim as it spreads across the water. This approach effectively combines fear of the unknown with the already present fear of the shark to create a chilling atmosphere for movie goers. Is it any wonder then that Jaws was a blockbuster hit? <br /> <br />It's this high level of suspense that I like most about Jaws. Like a fine murder novel, the scenes draw the audience into the setting, forcing you to identify with the characters. In due time, you begin to fear for your own life. After watching Jaws, you may not swim at the beach ever again... And any movie that can have that type of effect must be good! That's why Jaws ranks as a definite must-see film... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
0671027344|5.0|I recieved this book for my birthday with a card that read: My favorite book to my favorite person (allusion to an event in the book). That was five months ago and since i have read it seven times.  I am, like the protagonist, a freshman at highschool. And this book truly, really truly, changed my life. After reading the book for the first time i just laid there in bed and stared at it. I was in disbelief at how unforgettable and moving it was. I even cried, and I am a guy who doesnt cry often. Every time i pick up this book I end up staying up after one in the morning.  The first time I finished it was 3 AM, I took a walk through the quiet neiborhoods and just thought about life.  Even as I write this my eyes get some tears. This novel is not something ordinary, it is not something that collects dust on a shelf because it took too long to read and was not worth it at the end. It is something that I will never, ever forget, and if you read it you will never forget it either. Charlie is my favorite character in any story, seen or read because of his sincerity and overall genious. This book explores all aspects of highschool; music, sex, drugs, depression, feeling infinite, along with parts of life, like anger and even suicide and death.  Charlie observes relationships from his outcast point of view to such complexity and realism that I had to double check to be sure it was not real. He observes, and trys to participate, and has senior friends who show him new life.  The reader will empathetically begin to understand the blues, and the perks of being a wallflower.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Winner of three Academy Awards, and nominated for four others including Best Picture, The Pianist is one of the best films of the decade. Directed by Roman Polanski, The Pianist is a cinematic and artistic masterpiece similar to The Red Violin in that it was mostly overlooked until the Academy offered the necessary publicity to make it a commercial success on video and DVD. Set against the backdrop of an amazingly beautiful soundtrack featuring such classical composers as Chopin and Beethoven, The Pianist ingeniously illustrates the struggle of one man to maintain his dignity and his connection with civilization in the face of a personal hell on earth and some of greatest crimes in human history... <br /> <br />Actor Adrien Brody turns in a brilliant performance as Wladyslaw Szpilman, a piano player of immense genius in 1930s Poland. Szpilman and his family enjoy a life of relative wealth and comfort as part of the cultured and educated European social elite. But that life is turned upside down on September 1, 1939, when the imperial forces of Adolph Hitler's Nazi Germany invade Poland. As a Jew, Szpilman and his family are considered sub-human in the eyes of the German government, and a campaign of terror is quickly instituted against the Jewish population of Warsaw. <br /> <br />Szpilman must live his life the best he can while Warsaw is fenced in with brick walls, and its Jewish citizens are singled out and driven through checkpoints like cattle. At first, the residents of the Warsaw ghetto believe they can wait out the tragedy unfolding before them, but before long, men are assaulting old ladies for meager allotments of food, and citizens are risking death to escape the horrors of the ghetto. Szpilman survives for a while as a restaurant piano player, but he's soon forced into hiding as the ghetto is cleared and the Jews are sent off to concentration camps. <br /> <br />When Szpilman's family is shipped off by train to a death camp, he manages to escape and survive for a time in the abandoned ghetto. But it doesn't take long for the Nazis to find him and force him to work in a German labor camp. Escaping captivity, Szpilman survives in the attic of an abandoned bombed-out building in the Warsaw ghetto. While there, he befriends a German officer who shares his love of music and brings him food rations on a regular basis. As the war comes to a conclusion, the fate of both men remains in the air as the evils of the Nazi regime are displaced by the iron fist of Soviet expansion... <br /> <br />Based on the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, one the most accomplished piano players in all of Europe prior to the advance of the Nazi regime, The Pianist is a masterpiece on the big screen. The wondrous music and its compelling beauty stand in stark contrast to the horrors of war. Brody is more than deserving of his Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Ronald Harwood's screenplay is simply masterful. The precision with which this film tells its story, coupled with its intimate portrayal of the human condition, makes The Pianist one of the greatest films of all time and a definite must-see for anyone who harbors a love of artistry and cinema... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0007TKH66|1.0|This show is beyond stupid.  The first episode was the only entertaining one.  The rest where all disgusting, from the awful scripts to the Captain preaching to hostile aliens about loving one another.  Some crew members say \\"I can't do this it is too hard.\\" about certain things like deciphering an alien language.  But don't worry Captain Archer is always there to pat them on the back and say \\"I believe in you, you can do it.\\"  That type of manure is in almost every episode.  This show is leagues below \\"Voyager\\". I'm very pleased that this awful filth is being cancelled.  Don't waste  your hard-earned money on this. Go out and buy Star Wars on DVD.
0790734850|5.0|Winner of two Academy Awards, and nominated for seven others, LA Confidential was the surprise thriller of 1997. Prior to American Beauty and Gladiator, Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe starred in this seedy crime and suspense film - one of the best of the decade. Set against the backdrop of 1950's Hollywood and the celebrity culture of that era (quite indistinguishable from the celebrity culture of this era), LA Confidential projects a LA police department filled with corruption and a town obsessed with acquiring fame, money, and celebrity at any cost. <br /> <br />When members of imprisoned mob boss Mickey Cohen's gang start showing up dead, it's up to three cops on the LA police force to get to the bottom of the mystery. Their superior, Capt. Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) convinces wiseguys from other parts of the country to go home. It seems that someone is moving in on Cohen's underworld territory, but who? The police are led to the home of wealthy developer Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), who runs a prostitution ring of Hollywood look-alikes. <br /> <br />The investigative task falls to three cops, each of whom goes about his business in a different way. Deputy Lt. Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) is a by-the-book officer, following in the footsteps of his dead father - a former cop himself who was mysteriously murdered. Officer Wendell 'Bud' White (Russell Crowe) is a vigilante agent of law enforcement who believes in personally exacting justice and punishing those who fail to subscribe to his own perceived morality. As the son of a wife-beater, White has zero tolerance for abusers of any type. And rounding out the three is Sgt. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a self-absorbed cop in search of Hollywood celebrity (he consults for TV shows on the side) and money. In the end, these three men of differing realities must come together if they hope to uncover the truth surrounding these mysterious killings. <br /> <br />In the meantime, the conflict between the three menand Capt. Smith heats up. Each must wage a personal battle against the fraternity culture of the police force, the bureaucratic machine, and the rampant corruption that infests every corridor of city hall. Along the way, Bud White strikes up a relationship (as does Exley) with one of the prostitutes from the investigation, Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger), which complicates the investigation and compromises his judgment. But when a break in the case takes place, Exley and White put their differences aside and work together to solve the case... <br /> <br />With a surprise ending that's one of the best of the decade, LA Confidential is a cinematic masterpiece. Wrought with symbolism, and sporting a well-written screenplay, the film captured critical acclaim as well as box office success. Highly entertaining, and dripping with suspense, LA Confidential more than qualifies for its designation as a must-see film. If you haven't seen it, then don't wait another minute longer... <br /> <br />The DVD Report

Know what else makes you look like a fool? The fact that you took my review seriously! I figured with the whole \\"I can't form my own opinions and must like what everyone else likes\\" line I was making myself pretty clear. And the fake ghetto speak pretty much sealed the deal. If you honestly think a sane person would put 50 Cent, Eminem, and Simple Plan in the same group as talented musicians, I cry for you. I truly do. Every single one of my comments was a subtle 50 Cent bash. I HATE 50 Cent, and the fact that his mainstream gangsta rap bullcrap is number one on the charts along with Now 18,053 and Kidz Bop 74 makes me sick to my stomach. But YOU sir make me puke. If you are too stupid to understand simple sarcasm then you need to f**k off.     I also have a comment for Froggman. By rebelling against 50 Cent's mainstream crap, you are just throwing yourself into another group of musical posers. You want to tell people about good music? Fine. But when your list contains such cliches as Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, it's hard to take you seriously. You REALLY want some good music? Get yourself some Blind Guardian, Dream Evil, Mars Volta, Dream Theater, All That Remains, Edguy, Hammerfall, In Flames, ICP, Mindless Self Indulgence, Symphony X, Iced Earth, Rush, Zug Izland, Rhapsody, Tech N9ne, Sonata Arctica, They Might Be Giants, Helloween, Green Carnation, Fireball Ministry, Nocturnal Rites, Machinehead, Iron Maiden, and Children of Bodom.     Better luck next time, kiddies.

0743243153|4.0|Let me start by saying that The Road Less Traveled does not provide short cuts in the elusive road to happiness or self-satisfaction. It is a map, constructed from Peck's profesional opinions that assists in guiding those of us who are afraid to acknowledge challenge and pain. I've often found myself shut off from the world, but after reading it I came to discover that my isolation is a direct result of my choices. It gave me an outsiders perspective on the multiple excuses people make for themselves to avoid the loss of personal security.The Road Less Traveled is not for everyone, for there are portions of the book that seem misguided. Still, this is all part of the charm in Peck's philosphy on life. He isn't afraid of his imperfections, and he recognizes that in some areas his book is flawed. The Road Less Traveled is simply his educated opinion on life, nothing more, and nothing less.

B0007GAERG|5.0|Regardless of whether Mariah would actually win in this category at the Grammys, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" deserves a nomination. You just can't ignore the evolution that she's gone through. After an impressive 15-year career she comes back with her best and it deserves to be recognized on some level. The fans have already showed their appreciation, but it would be nice of the Grammys took time to recognize her hard work also. Mariah is worth her weight in Gold and Platinum. She does not disappoint on this record. Very few artists could have comeback at this level and this inspired. But Mariah did and that's what's really important. At age 35 she still has the desire to be the best and I applaud her for that.

1593072937|5.0|Anyone who has seen and enjoyed the recent Frank Miller/Robert Rodriguez film SIN CITY should definitely explore the graphic novels upon which the film is based.  THE HARD GOODBYE was the first of Miller's series of novels, and the one upon which the Marv sequence in the film is based.  As Miller tells it in interviews, he had been toying with the idea of creating some short 48-page comics dealing with a noirish urban area he called Sin City, and had been coming up with a lot of ideas, such as the geography, some of the back story, and a number of character.  But he was struggling to come up with a story.  One day, he says, he had a flash:  \\"Conan the Barbarian in a trench coat.\\"  And thus was Marv created.  The trench coat isn't a trivial matter with Marv.  Throughout the book he repeatedly expresses interest in coats, especially coats he can liberate from bad guys he is about to kill.  And once Marv's story took off, it wasn't a 48-page tale any longer.<br /><br />Some write or talk about the Sin City books as if Miller has reinvented the world of noir.  This simply isn't true, and no one who has actually followed the host of books and movies to follow in the wake of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler would find anything new in Miller's vision.  What little that is new is the extreme to which he takes some of the more garish elements of the hardboiled school, but those elements were all well established before Miller ever turned his attention to the tradition.  In particular, he is deeply indebted to Raymond Chandler's take on Dashiell Hammett's creation.  If you read Chandler's books, you quickly realize that he views his detective Philip Marlowe as a latter day knight errant, defending the helpless and rescuing damsels in distress, albeit with a thick veneer of world weariness and cynicism.  Marlowe has a tough guy exterior, but it hides a heart of mush and a profound moral code to which he remains true.  The only thing that Miller brings to the mix is a graphic vividness, and a stretching of the elements of the hardboiled tale to the point of caricature.  But Marv's determination to avenge Goldie's death is remarkably similar to Marlowe's dogged faithfulness to those to whom he feels loyal.<br /><br />THE HARD GOODBYE is part and parcel an exaggerated, almost garish recreation of Raymond Chandler's version of the hardboiled crime story.  Miller's heroes are a bit less law-abiding, but at heart they are guys with a profound dedication to idealized women.  Marv is insane, suffering from some unspecified mental illness to which he alludes but which he never describes.  The pills he takes keeps him barely on this side of over over-the-edge.  He is violent, hideously ugly, virtually indestructible, and profoundly dangerous.  Miller might describe him as Conan in a trench coat, but he also can remind some as a poor man's Incredible Hulk.  But where women are concerned, he is a softy.  One theme that runs through Miller's books is that the good guys are all protectors of women, and the bad guys their exploiters.  Most of Miller's bad guys rape, torture, assault, or otherwise exploit or kill women.  His heroes are determined to stand between the bad guys and the women.  One criticism of the books is that they are written from the male point of view.  They are male fantasies.  And the fantasies are not all that simple.  The men are for the most part ugly or even grotesque, while all the women are outrageously gorgeous in a sex shop sort of way.  The bad guys can be in many instances even more grotesque.  It is all highly stylized, but it is a stylization that remains constant throughout.  Miller's heroes are not good men, and in fact the only thing that divides many of them are their treatment of women:  the bad guys rape or murder women; the good guys stop the bad guys.<br /><br />I like Miller as an illustrator for the most part, but my one complaint is that many of the illustrations are not as strong as the best.  He is often inspired, and many of the images are unforgettable, but he sometimes can be merely average.  What I really like about Miller are his stories and his dialogue.  Sometimes people attempting to write in a hardboiled style can fall into unintentional parody.  Remarkably, Miller avoids that, despite the extravagant garishness of his characters and his imagery.  He often hits the right notes with his words.  Like many of the best comic book writers, Miller is better with stories and words than with images, and that's as it should be.  The imagery is a vehicle for the tale to be told, not the other way around.f the images are unforgettable, but he sometimes can be merely average.

0553213105|4.0|I cannot claim that Pride and Prejudice is my favorite novel of all time. After all, I am a guy and disposed to guy-ly things like action movies and bbq ribs. Pride and Prejudice, on the other hand, is a quaint British novel about a group of daughters and their various courtships and marriages. The main plot concerns whether one of these daughters-Lizzy-can or cannot overcome her initial dislike of a good man who subsequently falls in love with her. The device by which this plot operates, and extends into over three-hundred pages, is that everyone is either too scared, or too proper, to say what they really feel. The novel is conversation, conversation and more conversation, and almost all of it in an affected upper-class British speak where one talks around things, never about them. It does not entail much action-when it does it is usually characters traveling to a new locale to talk some more, and there is no bbq to be found at all, and so as I say, it is not, and by its nature cannot be, my favorite novel of all time. And yet, it is a testament to the skill of the author (and this is the first Austen I've read, and she has lived up to the hype surrounding her name) that, despite my lack of inherent interest in the subject matter, she managed to sustain my attention and, what's more, I can say that I completely enjoyed the reading. I would even be willing to read more of the same by the same. Her characters are interesting, distinct and likable, her dialogue true, and her descriptions sparse, witty and to-the-point.<br /><br />I give the novel 4 out of 5 stars because I enjoyed it, liked the characters and thought it well-written overall. It only loses its one star for being about things that do not compel me particularly; I'm sure that those who are predisposed to like conversation-driven British literature about social mores and marriage will rate it the full five.

6304698526|4.0|There's a story about a man who introduced himself to president Calvin Coolidge by telling Coolidge that he had made a bet with a friend that he could get the famously taciturn Coolidge to say more than three words.  \\"You lose,\\" replied Coolidge.  Steve McQueen has little more dialogue in this visually told police procedural drama.  The fact that there isn't alot of stupid chatter makes the movie seem smarter and tighter than it is.  I kept thinking I had missed something because the plot didn't make sense too me.  I didn't miss anything; the plot doesn't make sense.  Which doesn't matter a bit, because Steve McQueen is one of the coolest actors who ever worked in Hollywood and Jacqueline Bisset is a gorgeous girl, and this is a cool movie.<br /><br />And what a car chase!  This clearly is the best car chase ever filmed.  Oh, and what muscle cars we had in the late 1960s!  Pure, raw power, undamped by catalytic converters or the need for fuel efficiency.  This movie, and specifically this car chase (which is the main reason to buy the movie), set the tone for cop movies and TV shows for decades to come.

0385474547|5.0|Perhaps my favorite book ever, April 20, 2005 <br />Reviewer: Justice - See all my reviews  <br />This is a novel of startling beauty and without a doubt one of the best novels ever written. However, I want to thank the reviewer who noted that in high school he or she did not appreciate the book as much as they did in college. I could see someone in high school being turned off by the book, particularly if they were not taught about Achebe's own intentions in creating the book's plot and characters.  <br /> <br />For one thing, some reviewers seem not to understand that Achebe is not endorsing some of Okonkwo's character traits and see Okonkwo as some kind of chauvinistic cultural ideal of the pre-colonial African man. Rather, as Achebe has often said in interviews and essays, Okonkwo, and the entire portrait of his village was evoked to show both the beauty-and the flaws-of pre-colonial African society. As in all human societies, injustices were perpetrated.  <br /> <br />Okonkwo, then, is someone Achebe feels for-and wants us to feel for-but who he feels is tragic due to his rigidity and other problems. He is not intended to be a figure for emulation at all. Indeed, at times Achebe demonstrates the narrowness of Okonkwo's thought and the reality that other cultural models of masculine behavior existed in Ibo society at the time. For instance, Okonkwo is shocked when he hears one of his friends note that a great Ibo village leader has died and that the man would never do anything without first consulting his wife. Confronted with the fact that not everyone took the narrow view of male/female relationships he did, Okonkwo shows incredulity. Achebe shows with carefully crafted, elegant and subtle language that Okonkwo has become so wedded to one vision of Ibo cultural identity that ultimately any change introduced into that society destroys him. He clings to one vision of masculinity in order to feel he has lived a life opposite to that of his father, who had a completely different disposition but died in poverty. <br /> <br />Some readers don't like the book, therefore, because they confuse Achebe's sympathy with Okonkwo for his endorsement of Okonkwo's behavior, which is completely different. That does not allieviate the pain we feel when Okonkwo is defeated by a society that refuses to acknowledge that the Ibo have a great history and society and demands he conform to the Western encroachment. When Okonkwo feels his society is so degraded that it can no longer exist he can no longer exist, either. Achebe knew that a cultural purist could not survive under colonialism, so he treats the case with deliberate ambiguity. We are as upset as Okonkwo's friend when he dies (I cried for days) and furious at the petty and ignorant summary the Englishman expresses at his death, his dispassionate arrogance that mistakes Okonkwo's national pride for some \\"primitive\\" superstition, but at the same time we know he couldn't have survived in a new world and he could not accomodate change, something Achebe thought was dangerous. <br /> <br />Achebe once said that if he could convince his fellow Africans through his novels that their history had not been \\"one long dark night\\" but rather a rich and complex tapestry of sophisticated cultural, religious, and artistic expressions he would have succeeded at his goal. He certainly succeeded-although precolonial Africa had many kingdoms, the Ibo were supposedly without a leader and therefore people assumed it meant that they were a \\"disorganized tribe\\". However Achebe's book demonstrates the meaning, internal organization, poetry, ritual, and traditions that all human societies have and this book, which shows a world of beauty gone forever, fulfills Achebe's noble goal of wanting to demonstrate the validity of African history and does so more than many history books I have read.  Those history books are accurate, of course, but although they demonstrate what Achebe does they often do not pull you in emotionally, which is far more effective and I believe that is why everyone should read this book-perhaps not in high school, however.  I don't know, I didn't have it assigned to me then, so I don't know if I would have appreciated its nuances as a teenager.  But it's not worth alienating people who might otherwise pick it up.  For adults, it's a read you can't put down and a work of singular beauty.  FOR ADULTS IT IS NOT A DIFFICULT READ: I don't want anyone to get turned off by those who said it was, or to assume that it will be dense, hard to get through, or anything like that-its simple but potent language is one of its most amazing qualities. <br /> <br />It is the classic of the African continent, a tragic book that will lead any reader into a deeper understanding of colonialism, the colonial lie about \\"peoples without history\\",and Africa. Its richly rendered scenes are also some of the best written in the English language. <br /> <br />Read this book, it will change your life!  (For the better). <br />  <br />
B00005N7Z1|5.0|This is a classic movie. I have probably seen this movie enough times that I could recite at least 75% of it verbatim. I seen it back in the day when drive-ins where popular. I remember seeing the blood in this and being really drawn into the story. It is my favorite type of movie: A Revenge plot with lots of gore. Very violent and at times very funny. If you have been living under a rock for the last 15 years, then its time for you to go out and rent this or buy this. Oh and to the reviewer that said \\"I just couldn't deal with the violence\\" - please stick to Disney movies dude!
0393317552|4.0|Jared Diamond has done the world an extraordinary service by proving with his incontestable research that the differing levels of technology reached by diverse human societies throughout history can be attributed to environmental causes. <br /> <br /> This argument, so effectively proven by Diamond, rejects the argument that there is a yardstick of human achievement and that each people's progress on a Western model of development proves their worth.  I love how he shows that some societies \\"progessed\\" from the \\"stone age\\" etc. but then \\"reverted\\" when they found themselves in new terrain.  Many stories like this demonstrate the fragility of the old argument that \\"nation building\\" and movement from \\"hunting/gathering\\" to \\"industrial society\\" were the true measures of a given people's innate abilities. <br /> <br />So, while I feel humanity is in Mr. Diamond's debt for this invaluable service, I have to say this book is so densely written that it was not a pleasure to read.  If you are reading this, Jared, or if your publishers are, consider rewriting the book to not hurt so much.  I'm not one who finds most books difficult at all-I almost never struggle to get through any sort of book, but this book was so dry in places, which was sad considering the power and import of its argument.  <br /> <br /> It gave me a headache, and that's just not acceptable for a book with a thesis so important.  That's all I can say.  I want people to read this book: college students, scientists, historians, average Joes and Janes.  That will not happen if you don't attempt a rewrite of your central thesis in a more accessible style-I'm a grad student and certainly read more dense stuff than the average reader, so you can trust me when I say this book has to be fixed in terms of literary style. <br /> <br />If you truly care about making your views available to the public at large you will take that advice. <br /> <br />But for its overall value to humanity I highly recommend it.

The movie had great gore and bloodshed in it The butchery is beautiful. It has a very good story line that was way more developed than the original headless horseman story. This is a great Halloween movie. Great sound, great picture
0380778556|5.0|This book doesn't seem to have lost any of its appeal since it was first published almost seventy years ago.  If you don't know the secrets of this book, they still have shock value and you will still be intrigued and surprised by the plot turns.  There are a number of strong points to recommend this book: it very effectively creates suspense, fascinates you with the mysterious Rebecca, widow of glamorous Maxim (although she is already dead when the story begins her presence looms over every page and you wish you knew more about her), unexpectedly touches you with the relationship between the unnamed narrator and Maxim and effectively provides two points of suspense: the first portion of the book rests on a completely different sort of mystery than the second.  I won't give away the ending, or any of the book's secrets, except to say that the excitement doesn't stop until the end,even after critical details have been revealed.  As a young woman I can assure readers that, overall, the book ages well and will be just as exciting to young readers as older ones.  However, there are a few points that don't hold up as well which prompted some of the later feminist critiques/rewritings of the book (e.g. the idea of \\"bad\\" versus \\"good\\" women etc.,)and although the critiques are valid this is still a wonderfully written novel, a classic of the gothic genre, and I defy anyone to pick it up and be able to put it down!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Wow...just wow... <br /> <br />Since it won the best animated feature at the 2002 Academy Awards, I have wanted to see it.  <br />And I must repeat: <br /> <br />Wow...just wow... <br /> <br />Never before have I been affected by a movie like this. This is one that will stick with you days on end, long after you're done and returned it to the video store. It will have you lying awake in dreamless nights, thinking...thinking about everything...pollution...relationships...your family... <br /> <br />Spirited Away grabs you right from the beginning: You see Chihiro, an annoying ten-year-old girl whining about having to leave her old house behind and transfer to a new school. Her parents, however, feel the exact opposite. In fact, the thought of starting a new life excites an adventuresome spirit in them. Chihiro's dad, therefore, decides to take an old, dusty road, hoping it will eventually lead to their new house.  <br /> <br />From this point on, it gets truly amazing. The moment the lights go down on the old abandoned amusement park, Miyazaki's art and storytelling advance to a whole new level. One instant that really stands out in my mind is when Chihiro discovers her parents have transformed into pigs. The look, the expression, the lighting, the mood, the scenery sincerely brought an extreme emotion to the viewer-- I felt as disgusted and afraid as Chihiro did.  <br /> <br />As the narrative continues, I was entirely absorbed in the wonderful cast; I can't choose a favorite! There was the mysterious Haku, the eccentric Lin, the treacherous Yubaba-- all made me want to squeal \\"Oh! How delightful!\\" <br /> <br />And everything I thought was wonderful before builds up the the astonishingly poignant ending. This is the tale of one girl's journey to maturity. Spirited Away is a masterpiece-- and that's an understatement.  <br /> <br />Fifteen Thousand stars out of ten
B00008H2LB|5.0|This CD is awesome just like Hybrid Theory was. Linkin Park is doing what so few others have achieved; they are making CD's where all the songs are good. For the rock fans there's tracks like Don't Stay, Lying from You, Hit the Floor, Figure 9, and from the Inside. There's slower and softer tunes like Somewhere I Belong, Easier to Run, Breaking the Habit, and Numb. And of course the more hip-hop oriented songs such as Faint and Nobody's Listening featuring long rap verses. Overall, this a great album where every song is an enjoyable experience and this CD is really worth the money.     1. Foreward - It's awesome. Sounds like someone's mining something and then it shatters. 10/10    2. Don't Stay - Decent song to start off the album. Not as great as Papercut was from Hybrid Theory, but good anyway. Nice blend of singing and screaming. 8/10    3. Somewhere I Belong - Best song on the CD. Awesome music, great vocals, lyrics are good. 10/10    4. Lying from You - Rap verses are ok. Music fits the lyrics well. Repetition in 3rd verse gets annoying. 7/10    5. Hit the Floor - Worst song on the CD. Rap verses are stupid but at least they rhyme. Chorus sucks and the screaming is out of place. At least it's short. 6/10    6. Easier to Run - One of Linkin Park's quieter songs. Great verses and lyrics. Rap parts are unsually good. Great chorus. 9/10    7. Faint - Best song with rap. Vocals rock and fast paced music fits. Screaming goes well with the song. 10/10    8. Figure .09 - Strange title but a good song. Good verses, great chorus. 8/10    9. Breaking the Habit - Awesome song. Best song musically on the CD. Only Chester sings in this one and he sings it well. Good for those that don't like Linkin Park's rap. 10/10    10. From the Inside - Another great song. Good rap verses though not quite on Faint's scale. Decent chorus. Whispering in the background is nice. 8/10    11. Nobody's Listening - Awesome chorus. Kind of an I told you so song. Rap verses are ok, would have been better if they were sung by Chester. 8/10    12. Session - Just like Cure for the Itch from Hybrid Theory, this isn't really a song. But unlike Cure for the Itch, it does not posses strange qualities; it's just music. Pretty good music too. 7/10    13. Numb - Awesome song to finish the CD. Once again mostly Chester. Chester makes songs better. 10/10
B00005JMJG|4.0|When first I read the reviews of this movie, I was intrigued. My friends, my family, complete strangers, and forum posters showered this film with praise. I had to see what the fuss was all about. <br /> <br />Normally, I watch critically acclaimed films with skepticism. I have been disappointed in the past by such films, and I was determined not to get my hopes up again.  <br /> <br />After the first twenty minutes, when the opening credits began to roll, I was still a little leery about the film. Mainly, because I just didn't 'get it', which is a flaw on my part (I judge hastily on more than just movies). But, as the story unfolded, I found myself deeper and deeper into the characters' content, sadness, and anger. You can truly feel for these people. Even though it is fantasy, the characters just seem so real. It's refreshing to find a love story that displays the real love: complicated, and not always happy!happy!happy!. This film shows that true love is having the will to work through all the most difficult of problems. <br /> <br />The film was beautifully shot, brilliantly told, and all-around a wonderful experience. It will definitely tug on your heart-strings. Truly, truly great.  <br /> <br />\\"You can erase someone from your mind. Getting them out of your heart is another story.\\" <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|MIMI! MIMI! MIMI! OH! MIMI!  Girl you know you got IT! this cd bangs from start to finish; the vocals are polished to a T. mariah has gotten some much needed time off and the results all show in this cd. \\"say something\\" is the track not to missed as well as \\"shake it off\\" , \\"get your number\\" and the powerful \\"fly like a bird\\"! For the record this is not a \\"comeback\\" for mariah, this is one milestone in the many that's to come from this talented,i don't want to say songbird because that is too menial a word to use to describe a female artist as talented as mariah!  She's by all means an eagle; and right about now the girl is soaring! so don't miss this chance to hear a true pro! we should rejoyce that mimi is now free; To give us all what we love; and that is her heart through song!
B0007TKNIS|3.0|To start off, The sound track and the stage show is some of the best written in this era. I sing the songs, I dance the dances! What a great story! <br /> <br />That being said, here's my view of the movie. <br />The opening I found to be quite exciting; the transformation of the theatre from old to new was a breathtaking sequence. I loved the irony of the present being black and white and the past being color. <br /> <br />Then, the story began to slow down a bit...no not a bit. It slammed the breaks and sent the audience flying through the windshield. What worked so well for the stage show just didn't seem right for film; and even those who often complain about being 'true to the source', some things just don't translate very well from one medium to another. A few songs should have been cut or shortened, so the pace wouldn't be so slow.  <br />For example, \\"Wishing you were somehow here again\\" is a great song, but it we were watching too much of Christine just wandering through the cemetary.  <br />Also, the song \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" was too fast paced for what was being shown on screen. (Christine and the Phantom floating in the boat). The sound and the picture didn't fit each other. <br /> <br />Thankfully, the story picked up speed toward the end, and finished off nicely. The last scene was a nice touch. <br /> <br />Final rating: 6/10 <br />Had the movie been about 30-40 minutes shorter, it might have been Oscar material; But the film is definitely worth checking out one night, when you're bored.
B0000DCGT0|2.0|Biopics are hard to do when they're about people, let alone animals.  Arguably, this pic was about people too; however, the star of the show was a four-footer and his race---and, sadly, the production left me wanting to drown my disappointment in a feedbag of fermented oats. I had really been looking forward to this film, so it was a double-downer.  The close-ups of the horses were kind of thrilling, the stories of the people were not.  The use of bogus news reels was annoying and cheesy and, while I'm a Randy Newman fan, I found his score cloying.  The best of the three leads was Tobey McGuire; Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges both looked befuddled and misdirected.  Surprisingly, my favorite performer had only about 5 minutes of screen time: William H. Macy as a hyper-enthusiastic announcer---he nailed the 'tude and tone of sportscasters of yore.  I think Seabiscuit could have been a good documentary or a good movie, but not both at the same time.  Two thumbs down, both mine.
B00063MBU8|1.0|These guys are N Synch with crappy haircuts. Bland, simple and uninventive. Crappy hair bands like Poison are musically more talented than these clowns. Do yourself a favor and look for bands that are not played on MTV.
B000067CPX|5.0|With their 1984 self-titled debut, the Red Hot Chili Peppers clearly presented their in-your-face brand of heavy metal and funk. They continued to live the high life of sex, drugs and rock n' roll to it's fullest for years to come. Fast-forward to 1999, and you see a major reinvention of their sound on \\"Californication\\". Here, we catch a side of the Peppers that we've never seen before, except for maybe a glimpse on \\"Under The Bridge\\". Yes, we catch the band getting sober, and essentially, maturing. That is a scary word to some people. But the Peppers have done it better than any other band out there. Especially when you consider that John Frusciante returned to the group after seven years of heroin addiction and recovery. You can tell his playing is levels higher than his earlier works. The time is now 2002, and the Peppers have created an even better album, proving that they will be around for years to come. \\"By The Way\\" is an expansion and a refinement of it's predecessor. In comparison to their earlier works, the album is laid-back, mellow, sentimental, and bittersweet.<br /><br />Anthony Kiedis and John Frusciante steal the show. I've never heard Anthony's voice sound better. He has really settled into his style with exuberant confidence. John Frusciante also has a stunning voice, which is also captured on his solo records, which he has eight of, just like the Chili Peppers. The harmony that they display is absolutely breathtaking. Flea (bass) and Chad Smith (drums) provide the freewheeling rhythm section the album needs to keep it driving solid. Flea's funky bass playing is less prominent than their past records. I suppose some people will be disappointed with this record due to the overhaul in sound, which is a bogus reason. Some people are just stuck in their hardcore funk years. I for one, believe that a band needs to evolve. It would get boring if a band settled into one sound and played it the same for 30 years; not only for the listeners, but for the musicians. Their discography is like a canvas with a vast rainbow of different colors compiled in it, and \\"By The Way\\" is just as strong as \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik,\\" and \\"Californication\\". As an owner of all the Red Hot Chili Peppers, I like their new stuff more. There is something about their maturity through their troubled existence in pop music, that gives the music richness. This is not the Chili Peppers losing their flavor, this is the Chili Peppers reinventing flavor. It seems that these guys stem from an ever growing platform of new ideas and sounds, which makes it seem like this is just a new beginning to another 20 years of brilliant music. Some of the best tracks include \\"By the Way,\\" \\"This Is the Place,\\" \\"Dosed,\\" \\"The Zephyr Song,\\" \\"I Could Die for You,\\" \\"Midnight,\\" \\"Cabron,\\" and \\"Minor Thing\\".<br /><br />All these songs on \\"By The Way\\" flow together cohesively. Anthony's lyrics are so much more passionate, emotional, and vulnerable. There is also far less sexual aggression involved, making it more personal, and soulful. Some people might be saying, \\"Where's the funk?\\" It's in there, it just isn't right in your face; but it's definitely lurking around. There are just some things you need to discover for yourself, regardless of what naysayers will tell you. \\"By The Way\\" is among the elite in their discography.musicians.

B000002JKA|5.0|To the little Limey fag that bashed Dream Theater: Get off the computer, finish your homework and help your mamma do the dishes because it's obvious you have NO CLUE what music is. You, like all the other children in our country have been programmed by MTV to think the lifeless, generic crap they pollute the TV with is cool. Kurt Cobain (if he were alive) and the guitarist from Good Charlotte (what's his name again?) would sit and look at sheet music of John Petrucci's solos scratching their heads and looking like monkeys doing algebra. Dream Theater is one of the best group of musicians EVER. ANY of their CDs gets a 5 Star PERIOD. To the adults in the crowd that know what music is - You can't go wrong with any Dream Theater album.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is by far my favourite of all Radioheads work to date. The songs are fantastic and so different from one another and when they are put in the seemingly simple order on this CD it's absolutely F**cking amazing to listen to. <br /> <br />Just buy it.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I have been addicted to the Gilmore Girls since the first season, and now the whole family watches it on Tuesday nights.  When the first two seasons came out, we had Gilmore Girls marathon nights, and I am so excited about doing that again with the third season.  In this season, we see the \\"girls\\" grow a little as their personalities develop more and more. The supporting cast also shines. The Palladino's really capture the Gen-Xer's struggle with rebellion against the overjudgement of the baby-boomer generation while still trying to be a good parent and have functional relationships. They also capture the pop-culture obsession of the Gen-X '80s childhood. I truly identify with the \\"girls,\\" and the lack-of-soap-opera style of the Gilmore Girls is so refreshing in this tv era.  A close second on my list would be Everwood, also a WB show.  The characters are a little quirky, and the overall tone of Everwood is much more serious than the Gilmore Girls, but it still has that family feel.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Doesn't this prove the point for you? Music has no quantative determinant, no finish line, no height to reach. It's all about the  experience, each unique and emotionally fulfilling in its own way. <br />  There is bad music out there but that is what lacks genuine emotion. I think it would be wrong to say that any Beatles or any Beach Boys songs are actually bad even in their early \\"surfing days\\". <br />  They experiment more, good. They create lyrical puns or fulfill the context of the song, even better, but as long as music holds honest good feeling sounds with rhythm that touch us internally than it is all good.  As far as a quantative value that would make music better or worse there is none (maybe from an individual's viewpoint but even that changes) so stop wasting your time. <br /> <br />  (Besides if we were to think it was about experimentation we would all be listening to Miles Davis and if it was about composition we would all be listening to Mozart and if it was all about lyrical value we would all be reading poetry.)
B00080EU58|5.0|When the orignial version came out during there Jagermeister tour.  I wasn't sure about this cd.  After seeing them live (Which was an awesome show, Slipknot, Fear Factory, Chimaira)  I was gonna buy this cd but I heard about this release of the Special edition. So I waited patiently!!!! I'm glad i did! <br /> <br />The cd from start to finish eats babies!!!! After listening to it a few time through you can really appreciate it as a whole. Its definetly different from their other 3 releases. The second disc is well worth the few extra dollars and the wait!
0385510454|5.0|First and foremost Mr. Grisham is an entertainer. The price of this book is cheap compared to the pleasure that comes from reading it. Too often we are unnecessarily critical, especially when it comes to the writers who have written well in the past. Was this book one of Grisham's best? I really don't know, but I do know that I read it in one sitting and my biggest regret is that I know I'll have to wait year or more for another book, like this, from him. I just hope he never stops writing. For those of you looking for technical flaws, well there is one on page 329 that gets repeated a number of times in the following 10-15 pages. See if you can spot it. Thanks Mr. Grisham for the great read!!  [...]
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Only Eric Clapton would feel comfortable enough to return to his inspiration and explore his \\"blues roots.\\" Don't listen to any negative reviews. Those fans just want to hear their \\"guitar god \\" scatter notes like confetti at a wedding. Yet Clapton is so much more. He perhaps the most versitile artist of our day. Though I loved \\"From the Cradle,\\" this is an entirely different body of work. Eric Clapton is happiest when playing the blues. Is it any wonder that he would return to the Delta and do just that.
0385659806|5.0|This book was referred by serveral friends. I read it in two sittings and enjoyed it. The denouement wraps itself up quite quickly, but the true message of the book has already been conveyed. By experiencing life from Christopher's viewpoint, my own views and understanding of humanity has been improved. The thing that impresses me most with Haddon's story is that he did not end it with the sappy uplift that characterizes many of the books written about autistics. The struggle for the parents of autistics will simply go on. Most of us have embraced the reality that we must adapt to our children and stop looking for a cure or something to blame for autism.   Another reality that Haddon wrote of was that society will be slow to understand and accept autistics and their behaviors. [...]
B00005K9QP|5.0|This is the one! While America ignored it's black bluesmen, back in the Uk, the likes of John Mayall and Eric Clapton were quickly becoming afficionados. Most of what call rock/blues can be heard here. Mayall's song writing shows growth and his harp playing is unparalled. While Clapton shows that he is quite the guitar virtuoso, he surprises us with the lead vocals on a couple of tracks. A move that Mayall always  impressed upon him. Lastly, the remastered edition includes two bonus tracks that are difficult to find. \\"Lonely Years,\\" and \\"Bernard Jenkins.\\"
1573223085|5.0|Dan Pink's A Whole New Mind is so chock-full of ideas, websites to check out, courses to take, games to play, and places to visit, it is a resource you will want to have on your shelf and refer to for years to come.  The book models one of the skills Pink describes as being particularly valuable in our conceptual economy -- \\"symphony\\", as it draws together ideas from macroeconomics and business, neuroscience and medicine, art and design, education, as it argues that to be successful, we must be able to synthesize from different fields.      <br /> <br />So many business books are prolonged articles, boringly written, obvious, unsupported and impersonal, while pretending to offer the key to success in 300 pages.  This one is different.  Witty, readable and intelligent, it will help executives plot courses for their businesses and people to develop the skills they need for a career that won't be exported to Asia.  More than that, A Whole New Mind will help parents steer their kids' education, lobby their school boards for art, drama, and interdisciplinary education.  Pink's book is like visiting the Internet, though you can read it flat on your back:  it opens up new areas for further research, new places for more information and urges the reader to try out examples of the ideas he's advancing.  That's why you'll want to keep this book, not pass it along or borrow it for only a couple of weeks.   <br /> <br />Do we have a word that signifies a 21st century \\"Renaissance Man\\"?  Not someone who integrates Plato, Rousseau and Byron, but rather pop culture, successful charter schools, and brain scans?  That's Dan Pink.
B0002234LS|1.0|need I say more?  Had to put a rating in but they didn't have the option of putting a zero in.
B000078DOI|4.0|To me, this is the epitome of what the Chili Peppers represented at their peak. Fun funk and rockin' punk. If \\"Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\" wasn't my personal fave, it would easily be this. It opens perfectly with \\"Good Time Boys\\", then drops their first real hit \\"Higher Ground\\". And though I love those songs and \\"Knock Me Down\\", it's tracks like \\"Magic Johnson\\", \\"Stone Cold Bush\\", and \\"Sexy Mexican Maid\\" that make this so damn great. The original album alone is awesome, but then this disc is remastered, and has SIX bonus tracks. All of them are good, including the two more Hendrix covers that they drop. Of the re-issued first four albums, this is definitely the one to get. It'll make you feel 17 all over again.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|It might have not come out in the way that the world wanted but it is the way Mariah wants. A new start for Mimi!
B00000IAU3|4.0|I suspect this debut is something she will always have a hard time matching, because it's so good, and it seems to really touch alot of people. Dido says that she makes music that she wants to hear, and she's clearly not alone. I think this appeals to so many people because the music is a mesh of pop, folk, and electronica, and of course the voice and the lyrics are a plus too. \\"Here With Me\\" is a popular favorite and good opener, and no matter how many times I hear \\"Thank You\\", I always love it. That song just puts me into a trance. The rest is all very good, and it all leads up to my favorite song \\"Take My Hand\\". It starts very mellow, and builds up to a great beat, and is really quite an emotional and lengthy bonus track. So I say that a day without \\"No Angel\\" would be hell.
0684803356|3.0|According to the book's jacket, 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' is Hemingway's finest novel.  I disagree.  While the book does a fine job of describing the life of a partisan, its 490 pages only cover a few days' time.  So, don't expect a lot of fast-moving action.  This novel is basically a character study of the different persons in American volunteer Robert Jordan's hosting partisan band.  Therefore, if you enjoy character studies then you will indeed enjoy this book. <br /> <br />The plot is that Jordan is sent to blow up a bridge in the Spanish hinterland.  He is to contact a local partisan band and secure their assistance in helping him destroy the bridge.  Once he arrives at the band's secret refuge internal power struggles immediately begin as Jordan's mission will endanger the survival of all the band's members.  In addition, there is the inevitable romantic subplot between Jordan and the mysterious Maria. <br /> <br />Utilizing the flashback as a vehicle, Hemingway defines each actor's traumatic personal history, his/her decisions, and his character.  Jordan the idealistic young American university professor becomes the daring, charismatic, and ideologically indifferent demolitions expert.  Pablo the angry peasant becomes the murderous, avaricious guerilla leader.  Pilar the ugly yet happy wife of a diminutive bullfighter is widowed and becomes the overbearing, honorable wife of Pablo.  Maria the fragile, innocent virgin becomes the emotionally-scarred, vulnerable lover of Jordan.  Anselmo the venerable old peasant becomes the determined, brave guerilla fighter.  And so it goes with many of the other book's characters. <br /> <br />The book is a good character study and portrait of life as a Spanish partisan, but I found it to be much too slow moving for my taste.  This is decent novel, but it's not really a war novel.  In my opinion, Farewell to Arms is a much better war novel and is Hemingways's best book.
B00005JKN9|4.0|This film goes down rough the first time you see it, especially if you didn't know what to expect.  i then wiated a year and saw it agian.  the second time i had a critiques eye, and i must say this is a very good contemporary, and artistic film.  this movie wants to recreate the feeling of the era which it does, to a degree, but it also comunicates a message through exagerated symbolism, example, as the lead characters walk about, everyone around them is getting mugged, or murdered, or something, this is an exageration that i believe references how violence then was far worse than now, by comparing itself to the amount of violence and corruption in most other modern films.  what i'm saying is that the violence in this film is exaagerated, in that errar if that many people died every second, the army would have marched in along time ago.  but in order to communicate how much violence there really was the filmmakers try to unsettle you by raising your expetations and comparing itself to other films, blood is bright red, and very fake, giving the violence a really surreal feeling, as though its not that bad, like the violence is just part of the fantasy of the film.  ironicly that is just it, because the whole film is centered around violence and revenge, and how someone really goes about making change.  when the final battle happens, the blood becomes dark and realistic, as the brutality of conflict and it's utter uselessness dawns on him.  the movie is filled with so much symbolism, i liked it and it has alot of analitical value, but it isn't the most entertaining movie sadly.  only film buffs will love this one.  i still recommend renting, it or something, because it is worth seeing.  i don't k now about owning.
B0007GAERG|5.0|<br />There's only one word to describe this album : AMAZING!! I loved her last album \\"Charmbracelet\\" and I honestly thought it would be really hard to come out with an album better than \\"Charmbracelet\\". But I'm just amazed...speechless. This CD is the best CD I've listened to in years. I can play it 20 times a day and never get tired of hearing it. Her voice is so beautiful and flawless. Her lyrics are so personal and real. I can relate to every single song she wrote. Not only can she sing but she can write great tracks. Her clubs joints are fresh, original and catchy and her ballads just make you feel like you are listening to an angel. Mariah you outdid yourself. You have such amazing talent. So if you didn't get this album yet GO GET IT NOW!!!!! There's not even one bad song in this CD. My favorite songs are Shake it Off, One and Only, Stay the Night, Joyride and We belong Together.  <br />If you are a music fan and you appreciate good music this CD is a MUST. Best R&B album of the year so far. I hope she wins a Grammy for this because she deserves it. No wonder this album debuted at #1, her 2 first singles alone make it worth it.  <br />
B0007WZUMO|5.0|After I got to hear this album I was in awe.  I loved the Fragile and I loved The Downward Spiral, but this album builds on both of those albums so much. It's not as hard as TDS and not as \\"bloated\\" as The Fragile.  It's very solid.  Flows like a charm, in fact, better than any other album I have heard.  TDS had some filler and the flow was not even.  The Fragile had way too much filler.  Both were beautiful albums (Fragile is my favorite up to [W_T]).  I would rank this album around what I would rank Radiohead's OK Computer...perfect...flawless. <br /> <br />All the Love in the World : <br />5/5 <br />Great opener, IMHO.  Softer, but not too soft.  It has a nice little beat and at 3:12 starts to pick up a bit. <br />\\"Watching all the insects march along <br />Seem to know just right where they belong\\" <br /> <br />You Know What You Are? : <br />5/5 <br />Loud, fast, and heavy.  Reminds me of March of the Pigs, but with better effects with TR's voice.  One of my favorites on the album. <br />\\"Remember where you came from... <br />Remember what you are...\\" <br /> <br />The Collector : <br />3/5 <br />Not my favorite, but still an ok song.  Lyrics are good, but it just seems to bland. <br />\\"I pick things up <br />I am a collector <br />And things  <br />Well, things they tend to accumulate\\" <br /> <br />The Hand That Feeds <br />5/5 <br />I gotta hand it to the man, he picks some pretty catchy tunes.  I feel like dancing when this thing comes on for some reason.  And the lyrics aren't bad either.  Go Trent Go! <br />\\"What if this whole crusade's a charade? <br />And behind it all there's a price to be paid <br />For the blood, on which we dine <br />Just to fight in the name of the holy and the divine\\" <br /> <br />Love is Not Enough <br />4/5 <br />A good song...not the best...but a good song.  It's hard to compare many of these songs since they are quite the evolution from The Fragile or even from Still.  It has a rough quality to it...but not heavy or fast paced.Imagine \\"Piggy\\" being a character that has smoked for 30 years and has tattoos all over its body and you have this song. <br />\\"The tile on the floor <br />So cold it could sting <br />In your eyes is a place <br />Worth remembering\\" <br /> <br />Every Day is Exactly the Same <br />5/5 <br />Another favorite of mine.  Wow.  Blown the ARGH away by this and would buy the entire album just for this song (and luckily, we have other stellar tracks on this album as well). <br />\\"I am still inside here <br />A little bit comes bleeding through <br />I wish this could have been any other way <br />But I just don't know, I don't know, <br />What else I can do...\\" <br /> <br />With Teeth <br />5/5 <br />Hey, would you look at that.  A stellar track that follows another stellar track.  No filler hear...just a swift kick in the face.  This song reminds me of Reptile...but about 5 times better..and I love Reptile.  Also, if you pay attention to some of the interviews, you will see the significance of the lyrics. <br />\\"wave goodbye <br />to what you were <br />the roles have changed <br />the lines begin to blur\\" <br /> <br />Only <br />5/5 <br />Funkadelic Trent.  This song is sort of like the 70s and the 80s mixed together with some badass kick to the Jell-O.  I love it (again..a favorite).  I hate the whole funk/disco crap..but I love this.  It's sort of like 70's porno music....with teeth. <br />\\"now i'm somewhere <br />I am not supposed to be <br />and i can see things i know <br />i really shouldn't see\\" <br /> <br />Getting Smaller <br />3/5 <br />Tis' OK.  Better than \\"The Collector\\" but definatly not as strong as the others.  I like some of the lyrics and I'll listen to it.  I like it fine, but it does not shine like the others.  Nirvana + Trent's vocals = This song. <br />\\"Getting a little erratic here. <br />And I don't know who to trust, <br />I guess it got a way of reading my mind <br />I guess I gotta adjust\\" <br /> <br />Sunspots <br />5/5 <br />Classic NIN.  Right from the good ole' TDS cupboard.  I personally like this song.  Not my favorite, but a strong song. <br />\\"my life it seems has taken a turn <br />why in the name of god would i ever <br />want to return?\\" <br /> <br />The Line Begins to Blur <br />4/5 <br />This song is good to me..but not as good as others are rallying behind it make it out to be.  The lyrics are top notch and the song is well produced.  It fits well with the theme of the album too...just not the best to me though. <br />\\"As I lie here and stare <br />the fabric starts to tear <br />It's far beyond repair\\" <br /> <br />Beside You in Time <br />5/5 <br />Very minimalistic...but wow.  Somebody wrote on one ofe the ETS boards that this song has a heartbeat and it does.  Another favorite...woot! <br />\\"I am all alone this time around  <br />Sometimes on the side I hear a sound  <br />Places parallel I know it's you  <br />Feel the little pieces bleeding through\\" <br /> <br />Right Where It Belongs <br />5/5 <br />This could be the best of the songs ever.  It's reminds me of \\"Hurt\\" but only about 10x better.  Great, beautiful, and real song. <br />\\"if you look at your reflection <br />is that all you want to be <br />what if you could look right through the cracks <br />would you find yourself.... find yourself afraid to see?\\" <br /> <br />Home (bonus track) <br />5/5 <br />Why was this not put on the regular album.  I would have booted The Collector for this song any day.  Sort of like Right Where it Belongs...but not quite. <br />\\"Everything is catching up with me  <br />I awake to find I'm not at all where I should be  <br />And it feels I'm getting to the end  <br />And it's hard to figure out what's real and what's pretend\\"
B0007GAERG|5.0|i think mariah sound great, i've always been a fan of hers and i'm very happy that she is still very successful at what she does best, singing her heart out! may she always overcome all the negativities  that might surround her at hard times, keep her head high and prevail as the true talent she is!
B000000993|5.0|I am a die hard for life Tool fan. Anyone who doesn't like them needs to go f*ck themselves because they obviously do not understand what real and unique music is about. Any band can make music. BUT NOT MANY BANDS HAVE MEANING IN THEIR EXISTENCE. To this day, I have yet to hear such music by any other band like these guys have made. Maynard has the perfect voice for this music and I love his passion in his singing. He takes you into his world and makes you feel what he is saying. The best thing about Tool is Maynard's lyrics. They are for your interpretation. he never fully explains the meaning of his songs or what he is truly talking about. The mystery in his lyrics intrigues me because it's as if he wrote them in a way that you could interpret them into your life and make your own meaning out of them. Tool is a great band. I personally like their latest albums because their music is more advanced and sounds more loud and powerful. But one thing was true then and is still true....there is no on like Tool. I doubt that there is someone in this world with the views, conflict, opinion, and emotion like that of Maynard. I doubt there is a band with a bassist who can play like the song belongs to him instead of following what the guitar does, a guitarist who plays like he is psychotic, and a drummer who plays like he has 6 arms. You don't have to be a big Tool fan. But if you don't appreciate them, then what do you appreciate? Because these guys are different and they don't sound like anyone else. And to me that's what defines a band.
1400034779|5.0|This book was a wonderful surprise. I had heard of neither it nor its author before, but once I started reading the book, I could not put it down. I was charmed by its heroine, the wise and traditionally built Precious Ramatswe. The gentle, humorous, and lively depiction of Mma Ramatswe's life, friends, and family in Botswana pulled me in. The book is generous and forgiving in its view of human nature and human relationships. It also conveys a love of the land of Africa, and pride in the nation of Botswana. This served to remind me that human beings consist not only of their feelings, thoughts, and relationships (which are so easy to get caught up in), but also their national identities and ties to their homelands. We are individuals, and  also members of a society.
0385510454|1.0|I have read most of Grisham's books and up to this book found them to be enjoyable to varying degrees.   As I read this book, I kept feeling as though he was trying to fill up the pages with Italian to English translations.  That he had to  get a book out by a certain date and only had a weak plot.  Truly disappointing!
B0007GAERG|1.0|Voice...the only thing people could consider a factor in being successful to music. From high pitches to low, from unjustified to powerful, from simple to good vocal range, does it really matter? Let's say for example, a singer is singing in high pitches and powerful voice. How about the anticipation and feelings of the song? That's what Mariah lacks into this new album. <br /> <br />Though we can feel her vocal prowess, the songs are getting boring in a couple of minutes. \\"It's Like That\\" is nothing special, a normal upbeat or midtempo song with a glimpse of rapping. Same goes Track #2 and #3, which sounds alike. \\"Say Something\\" reminds me of the 90's look of pop/r&b and this combo is very typical and common from her past albums. \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" is a potential in the album - but now what I expexted it to be. \\"Joyride\\" also decreases the album rate. <br /> <br />My comment here is that we keep listening to the same Mariah Carey-nothing new. Of course, it's nothing great, but MAirah had a string of flop movies (Glitter) and a flop album (Maybe it was glitter or Charmbracelet, or Jukebox). <br /> <br />Mariah, please do better than this. I'm expecting a lot out of you.
0375758992|5.0|Huckleberry Finn is the only remotely similar book that comes to mind.  Both books are based on an innocent child's eye view and account of a wild and beautiful country, very well outfitted with modern firearms, as it steadily, daily, disintegrates into a civil war over race.   <br /> <br />In \\"Don't let's go to the dogs...\\" the child heroine's nickname is Bobo.  Like Huck,  little Bobo smokes and cusses and never misses a thing. The author is Twain's literary twin in some other ways, too.  She is a giant with a pen. She delights in constructing tall tales, really scary stories, and, I surmise,  absolute whoppers.  <br /> <br />The book is teeming with animal life and animal sounds and smells - dogs, lions, bugs, and baboons in the dawn --  and it contains the best snake story ever written.  I lived in Texas, where everyone has a  snake story. I have heard them ad nauseum and told a few. But the author has set down here the best snake-in-the-kitchen story ever told,  the new standard. <br /> <br />It is a disturbing book and I notice among the 120 reviews posted here various efforts  pigeonhole it and explain it or explain it away  - another signal that it is Literature.  But you can tell that from page. 1.  The real thing.  I am in awe.     <br />
B00006AW2F|5.0|Not your typical Stones record, but it's still amazing.  Lots of poppy stuff with pretty lyrics done very well.  \\"I'd Much Rather Be With the Boys\\" is a classic.  ESSENTIAL!!
B0001HLVS2|5.0|The premise: The British vessel \\"Surprise\\" chases the French vessel \\"Acheron\\" during the Napoleonic wars, with orders to destroy or capture the enemy ship. Problem is, the \\"Surprise\\" as a ship is outclassed in every way. The \\"Acheron\\" is faster and sturdier, with more cannons and crew. The \\"Surprise\\" is able to win the day through superior tactics and cunning strategies, thanks to Captain Jack Aubrey (Russel Crowe).    PROs:  + Acting, scripting, and cinematography are all wonderful  + Capt. Aubrey successfully deals with not only his enemy, but with dissent among his crew and critical ethical dilemmas  + Case study in how fine leadership wins out against impossible odds    CONs:   - If you don't like war movies, you probably won't like this movie.    Bottom line: At least rent this movie, and buying it would not be a waste of $20.
B00005JNTV|5.0|Based on the graphic novels of Frank Miller, this is a movie that you'll either love or hate immediately. Directed by Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Miller himself, this film is ultra violence and ultra risqué. Filmed in black and white with hint of coloring throughout, this film is exquisite. It's a combination film noire 1940's style detective novel meets Pulp Fiction, and I just loved it.  <br /> <br />The film is a culmination of several short stories, all intermingled. From the opening sequence to the ending credits, the film seizes hold of the audience, and dares you not to be entertained. The black and white is grand and enveloping; which tones down the blood splatter being spewed across the screen. This effect turns a would-be mad-slasher movie into cinematic genius. <br /> <br />This film has everything, from the A-List of stars which include: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, and Elijah Wood playing some sort of flesh-eating psycho that's just too cool for words and a far cry from his Frodo character of the last five years; to over the top storylines with ninja hookers, dirty cops, unstoppable vengeful superhuman hit-men, carnivorous were-boys, IRA mercenary militia and corrupt politicians. It's everything that you could ever want in a movie and more. <br /> <br />To try to explain the movie in words, would take to long, and would end up incoherent; let's just suffice it to say, \\"You'll have to see it to believe it,\\" and leave it at that. I must also reiterate that this film is very adult oriented; if you're easily offended or overly sensitive to adult content and graphic subject matter, then I would think twice before viewing. However, since I am neither of these, I enjoyed this film thoroughly. <br /> <br />[...]
0156027321|5.0|The audio version is fabulous. We listened to it on a 12 hour car ride with teen grandchildren. We were all in stiches at times (\\"Guinee pigs are not dangerous...\\") and the car ride flew by. The reader is excellant.
0451197968|4.0|I found this book well written, and had a thrilling edge to it. It almost felt like I was the one being chased! I would rate it five stars if they would have made the movie better, and shortened the chase a bit. His running from the hunters dragged on, when I would of rathered King write more about his life before.
B000002MP2|5.0|this cd is so good! although it's sort of old (i like newer music) it's still one of my favorite cds! and its so funny! the best songs are \\"Welcome To Paradise\\" (a remake), \\"Basketcase\\" (a stoner song~ its funny) and \\"Chump\\" (a song for everyone who's felt like a loser). Everyone of these songs shows off Billie Joe Armstrong's super sexy voice and the great lyrics and instruments. I would definately recommend it!
B000002LND|5.0|This compilation of Madonna's unforgettable hits from the 80s has received a lot of slack for the way the songs are remixed, faster, or basically altered in one way or another.  But you can't help but LOVE each and every song on this CD!      I must say even though most of the songs are different, I like the mixes of \\"Like A Prayer\\" (a faster beat) and \\"Into the Groove\\" (extended)....\\"Express Yourself\\" is the more industrial version that you may remember from the Blonde Ambition tour or THAT version of the video from back then... There are many that are cut short -- \\"Like A Virgin\\" and \\"Open Your Heart\\" suffer the most from this effect, but on the flip side, shorter versions of \\"Holiday\\", \\"Lucky Star\\", and \\"Borderline\\" sound better in that they cut out a lot of the instrumental breaks heavy on the first album ('Madonna').  \\"Material Girl\\", \\"Crazy For You\\" and \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" are simply updated (for '90) versions that lack a lot of the early to mid '80s characteristic sounds.  Those that want the \\"original\\" single versions should listen to them on the ORIGINAL albums -- where they sound the absolute BEST in their original form -- listened to as a whole with the rest of the album.    As for lacking a great deal -- \\"Dress You Up\\", \\"Causing A Commotion\\" and \\"True Blue\\" are among the missing hits.  Nonetheless, I would expect a GREATER, more EXTENSIVE box set to eventually come out.  At the time this was released, she had only been on the charts for roughly seven years.  Think about how fabulous it will be when she finally releases a full collection, 20-30 years into the game.
B0007GAERG|5.0|It'm so excited about the new Mariah album. It features her best vocals. She's back and \\"Mimi\\" proves it. If you're a Mariah fan I would go and pick this up right away. This is the first great album of 2005. I can play it all the way through without skipping a song. <br /> <br />1. It's Like That 5/5 <br />2. We Belong Together 5/5 <br />3. Shake It Off 4/5 <br />4.

B00001OH7O|5.0|this is by far the best bowie album in my opinion. my favorites are \\"queen bitch\\" \\"oh! you pretty things\\" and \\"life on mars?\\"  basically all of them are excellent with the exception of the belway brothers its long and kinda boring. here are descriptions of each track: <br />1. changes- overplayed, but very good if you dont listen to it too much; nice sax on bowies part and piano <br />2. oh! you pretty things- really nice singing and piano, one of my favorites, nice beat <br />3. eight line poem- very bizarre! its a really cool track. listen to the lyrics. <br />4. life on mars?- this song is so beautiful, the singing is excellent, the lyrics are so cool (very strange) but the beat is kinda cheesy <br />5. kooks- i dont really know how to describe this one. its very soft and makes me happy when i listen to it. <br />6. quicksand- its a good song overall mainly because of the chorus, which is really pretty. <br />7. fill you heart- this one makes me laugh. its pretty cheesy, but worth listening to. <br />8. andy warhol- funny tune, kinda like modern yodeling, and the beginning is cool with bowie and the recorder guy talking, etc. <br />9. song for bob dylan- good song, good beat, but pretty plain. it gets stuck in my head all the time, but its not as if you care about that. <br />10. queen bitch- BEST SONG EVER! can't stress it enough. this song alone is worth the 10 bucks. really nice guitar, singing, everything. <br />11. the belway brothers- my least favorite track. boring, plain.
B0006284JQ|3.0|(...) I'm writing this for a reason; to let people know what my opinion about this product is. Personally, I don't think it was time for Britney Spears to release a greatest hits album yet. I mean, she doesn't have that many \\"big hits\\". She has four studio albums out and by this point in her career she should already have at least four #1 hits in the U.S. When Madonna released \\"The Immaculate Collection\\", for example, she already had several big hits and several #1 hits in the U.S.    Below is a track-by-track review on each of the songs in this album and what positions they peaked in the U.S. and U.K. charts.    1. \\"My Prerogative\\" - (5/5) This is a previously unreleased song and a cover from Bobby Brown. I personally think Britney did a pretty good job with this song, even though it was not a big hit in the U.S. I like the way she interprets this song and I think it's a song that everyone can relate to.    2. \\"Toxic\\" - (5/5) This was the second single from Britney's \\"In The Zone\\" album, released in 2003. This is a song that can actually be considered for a greatest hits album. It peaked at the #9 spot in the U.S. and was a #1 hit in U.K.    3. \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" - (5/5) This was the first single out of Britney Spears' third album, \\"Britney\\", released in 2001. It's one of my favorite songs from Britney and peaked at #27 in the U.S. and #4 in U.K.    4. \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" - (5/5) This was the first single from Britney's second album \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\", released in 2000. Another excellent song from Britney. It peaked at #9 in the U.S. and #1 in U.K.    5. \\"Me Against The Music\\" - (5/5) This was the first single from \\"In The Zone\\" and features Queen of Pop Madonna. The song is a good party song and peaked at #35 in the U.S. and #2 in U.K.    6. \\"Stronger\\" - (5/5) Another one of my favorite songs from Britney Spears. It was the third single from \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" and peaked at #11 in the U.S. and #7 in U.K.    7. \\"Everytime\\" - (5/5) One of the few ballads in the album. It was the third single from \\"In The Zone\\" and peaked at #15 in the U.S., but was a #1 hit in the U.K.    8. \\"...Baby One More Time\\" - (5/5) Who has not heard this song? Britney's first single from her first album, \\"...Baby One More Time\\", released in 1999, and also her biggest hit ever. It peaked at #1 both in the U.S. and U.K. Definitely a classic.    9. \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy [The Stop Remix!]\\" - (5/5) This was a big hit from Britney's first album, even though this version is not included in the album. It peaked at #10 in the U.S. and #5 in U.K.    10. \\"Boys [The Co-Ed Remix]\\" - (5/5) The original version of this song is included in Britney's third album, but this version comes from the soundtrack of the film \\"Austin Powers In Goldmember\\". It peaked at #21 in the U.S. and #7 in U.K.    11. \\"Sometimes\\" - (5/5) This is the second single from \\"...Baby One More Time\\". It's a very nice song and peaked at #21 in the U.S. and #3 in U.K.    12. \\"Overprotected [The Darkchild Remix]\\" - (3/5) The original version of this song is included in \\"Britney\\", and I really think it's better than this one. I really don't see anything special about this song. It peaked at #25 in the U.S. and #4 in U.K.    13. \\"Lucky\\" - (5/5) This was the second single from \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\". It's another nice song with okay lyrics. It peaked at #23 in the U.S. and #5 in U.K.    14. \\"Outrageous\\" - (3/5) What is this doing here? And who says this was a big hit? I really don't know why this song is included in this album. It comes from \\"In The Zone\\" and only peaked at #79 in the U.S. and didn't make it in U.K. Britney should hate this song since it was the song for which she had an accident when recording the video for it.    15. \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" - (3/5) I really don't see anything special in this song either. It was the second single from \\"Britney\\" and peaked at #52 in the U.S. and #2 in U.K.    16. \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" - (3/5) This is a previouslyunreleased, but not new, song. When I bought Britney's fourth album, \\"In The Zone\\", a little card was included that allowed me to go to Wal-Mart.com and download two never-released-before songs. One was a remix version of \\"Me Against The Music\\" and the other one was this one, so I had already listened to this song. It has a funky party beat, but lyrically it's relatively mediocre.    17. \\"Do Somethin'\\" - (5/5) Another previously unreleased song. This one is her second single from this compilation and it is pretty catchy as well.    All in all, this is a descent album, but I don't think Britney has enough \\"big hits\\" in the U.S. to come out with a greatest hits album. I consider \\"big hits\\" those that make it to the top ten in the charts. She shouldn't have included \\"Outrageous\\" or \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\". Instead, she could have included \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" and \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\". As we can see, Britney is huge in U.K., but somehow she rarely makes it to the top ten in U.S. charts and only has one #1 hit in the U.S. I give it three stars because it's a good party album. I recommend this album to Britney fans or to people who are looking for a good party album. And to the haters, please stop talking all that stuff about Britney, why don't you just let her live?
B0007WZUMO|1.0|Trent Reznor is a talented artist. <br /> <br />\\"The Downward Spiral\\" was an instant classic; it still sounds not of its time. <br /> <br />\\"La Mer\\" was the only decent track on \\"The Fragile\\". <br /> <br />\\"With Teeth\\" is tired before it even got up. <br /> <br />Artists should no longer make \\"art\\" when they no longer have anything to say. Trent Reznor has become a craftsman.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is a perfect CD. I absolutely loved the Mars Volta's debut 'De-Loused In the Comatorium' and I was kinda think this CD might not be as good. Man, was I ever wrong! <br /> <br />There is pretty much 5 songs on this album, but it spread over 12 cd tracks. All of the songs are great and very different: <br /> <br />Cygnus... probably has the greatest opener for any song ( or album) i have ever heard. It goes right into a fast paced onslaught or great music that will bust your head open. There is no empty space on the album so it goes right into... <br /> <br />The Widow. This song is the shortest on the album clocking in a about 5:50 i do believe. It is quite slower then Cygnus... and ends very, um, differently than most songs, but after that comes... <br /> <br />L'via L'viaquez. Ok, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to tell that this song has latin influences. More than half the song is sung in spanish which makes it very cool to listen to. After this comes... <br /> <br />Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore. Wow, that's a mouthful. Another good song. Very calm. It'll pretty much put you in a trance every time you hear it. And now, it's time for... <br /> <br />Cassandra Geminni. This is one of the best songs I have ever heard. It spans 8 track of the cd and is more than 32 minutes long. It is an absolutely mind bkowing song though. Cedric and Omar have really done it with this one. Oh yes, and might I add that Omar is the best guitarist of our day? <br /> <br />Just go out and get this album... NOW! It will do you good.
B000000H5J|5.0|this is one of THE calssics of the future, a truely great album and a landmark in modern metal, the industrial sounds and bass drum beats are so atmospheric and technically awesome, and the mighty fear factory are right on top of their game. Every metal fan should own this, even a fan of lighter metal such as maiden etc. listeners of any form of metal will see the quality and pure revolutionary origianlity, THIS, ladies and gents, Is REAL extreme metal, at its very, ...very best!, 11/10  also did i mention that this album was released in 1995, and still to this day it kicks the ass of any metallic metal today, even without the foresight and technology, this masterpiece as well as fear factory were years and years before thier time, revolutionaries.    i read a review saying that the legend burton C bell COPIED COREY TAYLOR!, that is a friggin joke, get your facts straight kid!, if it werent for frontmen like Burton, your precious 'corey from slipkot' wouldnt even exist. also and the part about you saying about the drums not being there, raymod herrera is one of the greatest metal drummers EVER, far beyond that random basher joey jordison, Raymond is a legend, and also the greatest and possibly the fastest man to ever grace the double bass drum pedals, enough said.
B000002UJQ|5.0|That's all I can say. And what's with these people saying he can't sing?? Have you actually listened to the album? Crazy. This album is perfect in every way and deserves a perfect score. Screw all you nay-sayers.
B000059XUP|5.0|Sure, some say that this film doesn't live up to the \\"original hype\\" as seen with the first film, but I was truly impressed with the variations of love that both films show.  Instead of a love found between male and female partners, it shows a bond between flesh and blood, and how much a father truly loves his son, even though his son is the reason for their death.  While Sarah and Gabriel make reappearances in this film, their roles are fairly trivial, leading to Sarah's death in the end. <br />Of course, it's not Brandon Lee and I would want nothing to replace him, but it's an excellent continuation, if not another chapter of the crow which carries souls that are not at rest in death until the moment that they come to set wrong on the right path.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|GOTHIKA is a rip off of the excellent STIR OF ECHOES. A ghost seeks help from a person to ensure justice is done.  Gothika moves along quickly which is a good thing, but the performances are wooden and just dull.  Hal Berry winning an Oscar for Monster's Ball some years ago did not help her secure better roles, did it?  Gothika is a clumsy and overall poor film.  Give it a miss...
B0007GAERG|4.0|Congrats Mariah on a job well done!  404,000 first week sales impressive.  But how is the album?  Well it's . . . errr uhhh it's better than OK but no where near Butterfly.  This may not be Mariah's best album but despite her goofiest title this is her most adult CD however, what Mariah Carey has always been good at is Singing and Songwriting.  Once she got good at Sales it seemed that that became the focus.  Don't get me wrong there is plenty to love here.  The first four songs are perfect It's like that great club song We Belong Together classic R&B heartbreak Shake It Off updated R&B defiance and Mine Again the classic 70's ballad.  But i want you to really listen to \\"The Voice\\" that's back.  Turn the stereo up and concentrate and you will hear that there is strain and Echo effecting.  Don't take my word for it---listen for yourself. Any one who knows Mariah from Music Box/Daydream days knows that those were albums that she undersung on but yet there was an effortlessness there.  \\"The Voice\\" only presents part of the problem.  The other comes with the lyrics.  Where is the poetry and the 4 syllable words.  What upset me most about It's like that was the lyrical simplicity.  To go from \\"It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak when you smile at me and you tell me the things that you know persuade me to relinquish my love to you boy i cannot resist at all\\"  on 99's heartbreaker to \\"I came to have a party Open up the bacardi Feeling so Hot tamale boy i know youre feeling me so whats it gonna be\\"  on It's like that seems like a desperate attempt to sell records.  The rest of the album is very good standouts include Say Something (although Mariah is upstaged by both The Neptunes and Snoop) Circles (my absolute favorite) Joy Ride (which goes on and on but i love it anyway) Fly like a bird (although doesnt hold a candle to My Saving Grace) Get Your Number & To The Floor (Mariahs two chances for #1's)I would like to end this pointing out some very important points that ihave come to realize in dealing with this review site.  1st yes i am a fan but as a fan you must be honest.  I am not gonna pass this off as the greatest album ever recorded because i am a fan.  Mariah doesnt need my help nor does she care about my criticism.  Secondly AMAZON IS NOT A FAN SITE so leave the unhelpful votes to those who arent Mariah fans and just think my review sucks.   <br /> <br />Final Verdict:  Emancipation is a good buy whether you are a fan or not.
B0002234LS|3.0|Despite the many poor reviews for SECRET WINDOW, I found it quite an interesting and intriguing film.  The twist at the end was good but unfortunately it has been done before.  My immediate reaction was that it was a rip off of \\"Identity\\" which also explores the imagination of someone with split personality.  Otherwise, it is a clever film and the atmosphere was spot on.  There were genuine creepy scenes which made it worth the price alone.    For those who have seen IDENTITY (John Cusack, Ray Liotta), you will know what I mean about the twist.
0156027321|5.0|With a blurb that proclaims that this is a story that will make you believe in God, one thing can be said that \\"Life of Pi\\" certainly has big ambitions. The amazing thing about it however, is that (for me, anyway) it makes a pretty good case for this statement to be true.<br /><br />Yann Martel begins the tale describing his own experiences as a writer with the dreaded writer's block. Taking a trip to India in order to bring his inspiration to life, he meets Mr Adirubasamy, a man who claims to know a story that will make you believe in God. Intrigued, Martel inquires further, gathers the relevant information and is soon knocking on Piscine Molitor Patel's door. Piscine Patel (strictly \\"Pi\\" for short) survived for over a year in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger, relying his logic and reason, his animalistic instincts and above all, his abiding faith in God to help him do it.<br /><br />Martel switches to Pi's story, telling it to us in first-person narrative, as Pi tells us of his life in India before his fateful voyage to Canada. He was the son of a zoo-owner, and happily spent his childhood studying the animals in the paradise-like Pondicherry Zoo, and following his own rather unorthodox religion of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, delighting and believing in all three.<br /><br />But when the ship taking him and his family to Canada sinks, Pi finds himself adrift in a lifeboat with a zebra, an orang-utan, a hyena and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Fighting to stay alive in such conditions is Pi's task for the next two hundred and twenty seven days, as gradually he realises that the only way to survive Richard Parker is to learn to live with him. The domestication of the tiger begins as Pi becomes the ringleader, zookeeper and alpha male in the tiny world of the lifeboat.<br /><br />On the way, Pi must deal with his own physical suffering and internal impulses, as well as a cannibalistic Frenchman, the tediousness of the days and an island that Jonathan Swift's Gulliver seems to have missed on his own voyage - an island holding a carnivorous secret.<br /><br />It all sounds more than a little odd, but Martel grasps our suspension of disbelief and forces us to make us believe in what he's saying. It is not simply his attention to detail of the lifeboat's interior, the systematic taming of Richard Parker (rest assured, if you ever find yourself in a lifeboat with a tiger after reading this, you'll know exactly what to do), or the outside sources he quotes, such as the newspaper articles on Pi's ordeal or the transcript of the Japanese businessmen's discussion with Pi, but the utter conviction with which he speaks.  I could not help but agree with whatever he said, whether it was the state of animals in zoos or the workings of God and mankind. The degree of wit and intelligence he writes with is intoxicating.<br /><br />The third and final part of the book is perhaps the most fascinating, when Pi discusses his voyage with the two Japanese businessmen, and ends up telling them two stories: one that he claims is true, with the animals in tact, and a second one in which he replaces them with humans in a more realistic, though painfully dreadful version of events. He then poses the question: since it doesn't really make a difference which one you believe, then you have a choice on which one you decide see as the \\"true\\" one.  In this lies the promising statement - that this story will make you believe in God, as Martel points out the advantages of faith far outweigh those found in atheism. And since there's a good chance it doesn't make a difference anyway, Martel's answer to \\"Why believe in God?\\" is:<br /><br />Why not?that Jonathan Swift's Gulliver seems to have missed on his own voyage - an island holding a carnivorous secret.  <br /> <br />It all sounds more than a little odd, but Martel grasps our suspension of disbelief and forces us to make us believe in what he's saying.

0553212737|5.0|Out of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is perhaps the most unique and the most beloved. Unlike all the others, Emma is a wealthy young woman who does not have the pressure of making a good marriage to ensure her happiness and in fact is determined never to wed. Likewise, due to the affections of her father and governess, Emma has been indulged and encouraged all her life into behaving just as she pleases, and as one of the few members of nobility in the small county of Highbury she is a big fish in a very small pond. Due to this, she considers herself superior to others and confident of her own perception of things: to put it simply, she is a snob. Yet she is not dislikeable - she is loving, well-mannered and kind, and deep down she realises that many of her actions are folly - it just takes her a while to get to these conclusions.<br /><br />Crediting herself for the recent marriage of her governess to the estimable Mr Weston, Emma takes it upon herself to play matchmaker for Highbury's society. Her eye is fixed on the eligible clergyman Mr Elton as an excellent match for her new friend Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure birth and minimal wealth. Despite the cynicism of Mr Knightley, an old family friend and the caution of her dear Mrs Weston, Emma is too wrapped up in her own opinions of how human hearts work to heed their advice...<br /><br />Further irony is found in the fact that whilst Emma is busy organising the hearts and minds of those around her, she has utterly no regard for her own and finds on many occasions that her perceptions of people were completely mistaken. But this is where readers' affection for her lies: she is beloved *for* her faults, not in spite of them, and such imperfections make her a rich, understandable character. Furthermore, these faults give her room to grow and improve as a person, and she is not the same Emma at the end of the book as she was at the beginning.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is also filled with many memorable supporting characters, very few of which are painted in black and white terms - rather they are small portraits of true human life, each with their own good and bad attributes. There is the talkative Miss Bates and her niece Miss Jane Fairfax (who Emma is cool toward due to the fact she detracts attention away from herself), the pretentious Eltons, Emma's sister and brother-in-law, and the and the dashing Frank Churchill, (Mr Weston's son) on whom rest many hopes by his family of an alliance with Miss Woodhouse.<br /><br />Austen writes in beautifully delicate language, which is filled with many of her best moments of wit and insight into the human condition, especially in her themes of social hierarchy and acceptable forms of manners. It is a common belief that authors of the past are hardly ever critical of their own times or station - Austen gloriously proves these narrow-minded people wrong as she weaves together her characters and their various ways of life with commentary on them all. Like all such reads, it's not for a lazy reader as it needs your constant attention and care. But like all truly good literature, it is well worth the effort and considered the best novel in the Jane Austen canon.e supporting characters, very few of which are painted in black and white terms - rather they are small portraits of true human life, each with their own good and bad attributes.

B00005IC2H|1.0|Painful to listen to, utterly inane, worthless. I'd rather have long steel needles shoved into my ears, and acid poured into my eyes, than listen to this piece of junk.
B000002KNY|5.0|Rhythmic, electronic, paranoiac and foreboding in both words and music it is at the same time for some reason somewhat infectious. Through out the album the Talking Heads never stop the hard driving pace (highly recommended for waking up to and for commuting). It has an air of dark mystery through out. These are surreal songs for surreal times. The lyrics at times are highly clever and sometimes down right laugh out loud funny. <br />Highly recommended
B00000C3G6|5.0|Of all the varied combos these 4,(Crosby, Stills, Nash and/or Young)have put together over the years, I would have to say the best is CSN. Having said that, however, the best comination besides CSN has been Crosby and Nash. Their albums have been the most cohesive and satisfying. The Stills-Young experiment didn't quite work, and the CSNY combination was less a group effort than a batch of solo recordings under the CSNY banner. Of the four Crosby-Nash albums, this is, in my opinion, the best one. I bought this album on vinyl in 1972 and played it over again until I  came to know the songs as you would come to know old friends. Page 43, Frozen Smile, Immigration Man..all wonderful songs. I'm certainly not taking anything away from Stills or Young. I think their talents speak for themselves. What I am saying is that when I hear Crosby and Nash together, I get the feeling of good friends singing together because they like to.<br /><br />You don't get the impression of two guitar wizards trying to out duel each other. So, if you're thinking of exploring the Crosby-Nash combination, start with this, the first album, and go from there. You'll like it.
0800177363|5.0|An incredibly moving and touching story that speaks on many levels. DeNiro and Williams do a wonderful job at making this story poignant and believable. <br />   Based on a true story it tells the work of a reclusive and emotionally isolated researcher  who works with patients who are initially introduced to him as incurable. These patients are unable to talk and unable to move and in away reflect the social isolation that the doctor-hero suffers.   The doctor stumbles on not only to similarities in these patients medical backgrounds but a possible cure for their affliction. The cure is indeed successful but only for a brief time. <br />   The movie is a great metaphor for the human condition, a commentary on the challenges of medical advancements (challenges which are not only academic but sometimes monetary and political) and also gives some insight into the mind of a scientist and why some of them suffer from what many would see as eccentricities and social isolation. <br />
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a book I would recommend to any reader at any age. There is something to be found for everyone in this book. Mitch Albom captures his relationship with his old college professor, Morrie, beautifully. Morrie's words of wisdom can inspire anyone. This book turned me around the first time I read it. Morrie talks about how people should \\"do what the Buddhists do. Every day, have a little bird on your shoulder that asks, 'Is today the day? Am I ready? Am I doing all I need to do? Am I being the person I want to be?' This is the best advice I could offer anyone. Maybe if we all did this the world would be less hectic. Reading this book makes you realize the small things in life are not what matter the most, instead it is your relationships with others and how you live your life that are most important. I am a college student now, preparing to be a teacher, and I hope that someday I could affect a student even in the smallest way the way Morrie has not only influenced Mitch, but an entire following of people.
B000002UB6|1.0|What a lost opportunity. The real \\"Get Back\\" is available from Apple in Russia(!) backed with, of all things, \\"Yellow Submarine\\". Which makes sense if you think about it. Technically, \\"Get Back with Don't Let Me Down and 9 other songs\\" (the album's original title) would have followed \\"Yellow Submarine\\" if the Beatles had released it as nature really intended it! <br /> <br />The Russian \\"Get Back\\" sparkles with remastered sound, sounding better than the lousy UK CD releases from the 1980's. Here's the track listing: <br /> <br />One After 909 <br />Don't Let Me Down <br />Dig a Pony <br />I've Got a Feeling <br />Get Back <br />For You Blue <br />Teddy Boy <br />Maggie Mae (a hidden 'bonus track') <br />Two of Us On Our Way Home (the original title) <br />Dig It (tracking time 4 minutes 12 seconds--awesome cut!) <br />Let It Be (the original, non-Phil Spector version) <br />The Long and Winding Road (no strings, no choir) <br /> <br />This album was actually released to radio stations in 1969. I got my hands on a bootleg copy so I know how great it was. This is the FIRST time I've ever seen it on CD--at least in this EXACT form. And it's remastered! Pristine sound from the original masters. <br /> <br />Why couldn't Capitol release this to American/UK markets instead of the vastly inferior \\"Let It Be-Naked\\"? Russian Beatle fans are treated WAY better than their American/UK counterparts. Go figure. <br /> <br />I'm so glad I live in LA where I can actually find this stuff. The Russians have also released the British Stones catalogue with bonus tracks; pristine sound, UK running lineup, singles and outtakes included. Just awesome.  <br />
B0006IIKS0|1.0|This movie is good as a joke. Listening to these guys talk is a laugher. Pretentious to the core and as big of egos as the sears tower. I love Lars lying on his couch discussing his \\"art\\". Or James Hetfield driving around in his ridiculosu little hot rod going \\"i have a need for speed and danger\\". UGH! <br /> <br />These guys are the kings of sell-out. You attack your fans and alienate all but your hardcore audience and then have the nerve to put out a video showing how emotionally draining the new album was and how depressed you all were. Except for 80's hair holdovers, no one is listening to Metallica anymore. I especially enjoyed the part where Hetfield trashed his own lyrics and then decided to put it into the song anyway. <br /> <br />Bob Rock and the COACH were the biggest joke of all. Bob Rock is a horrible producer and shouldnt be allowed to touch a control booth much less play on a record. On to the COACH, an overpaid sissy man who gets paid obscene amounts of cash to tell men to talk to eachother about their problems, DEEP!  <br /> <br />The reason these guys need a counselor is because they are ego maniacs who have lost touch with reality a long time ago. Hungrier bands have come and gone and left a better sonic assault than Metallica in the last 10 years. <br /> <br />Watch this if you are looking for a laugh.

That is one good thing about QOTSA, they just dont throw out another album right away, they work and get it right.  Wonderful album, get it.

I should have steered clear when I started seeing comparisons to Radiohead, but I was suckered by the positive reviews. Once upon a time, alternative music, and alt-country especially, could be relied on for simple pleasures, and at some point things would start to rock. No more. Lyrics are almost unrelentingly morose, melodies are virtually non-existent, and you get the feeling that no one enjoyed making this music, nor do they want you to enjoy listening to it. We have gone from No Depression to All Depression. Jay Bennett didn't leave the band because of this music.

0316172324|4.0|While it's not as good as the previous book - TIpping point, Blink is still a very quick, interesting read.  Where Tipping point focused on the group dynamics of how things change, this book looks more at the personal realm.  How people make \\"unconscious\\" decisions and judgments - very interesting stuff.   <br /> <br />Gladwell clearly has a wonderful intuition about how people operate, either in a group or individually.

B000002UC5|2.0|I was a Beatles and McCartney fan 30 years ago. For some reason I never got around to listening to this album until today. I probably could have just as well waited another 30 years.  <br /> <br />When McCartney's musical mind is firing on all cylinders, the result is a five-star album like Ram, Band on the Run, and Tug of War. I don't begrudge the man a little experimentation, but I find the musical and lyrical content of his first solo project rather sparse. Maybe I'm Amazed is a great song, and it receives a credible treatment here, though I frankly prefer the live version from the Wings Over America set. Junk is an endearing and perhaps enduring little ditty. Apart from those two, you may be bored out of your skull (or skulls, if you are Zaphod Beeblebrox).  <br /> <br />McCartney's most devoted fans will of course want to have this album and McCarney II, which is in the same minimalist vein. For people who have their McCartney-worshipping tendencies in check, I'd advise avoiding this record, unless you want to have it on hand to play when you have unwanted guests you want to encourage to excuse themselves and leave.  <br /> <br />Better to listen to Band on the Run for the umpteen thousandth time than this collection, most of which is throwaway material -- most of these songs could be, at best, a germ of something better. This is the sound of a great artist floundering.
B000002BQK|5.0|arguably mariah's best album depending on who you talk to.ask a urban music fan they'll pick this album as her best.ask a contemperary listener and they'll say music box lol.so it really depends on who you ask and what side of the fence their on,or the side of the tracks for that matter.some believe she \\"sold out\\" while some think she \\"sold in\\" lol. either way i'm in the former group who thinks this is her best album,its verry 97 but it really doesn't sound dated at all i like the whole album but i have 2 stand out tracks<br /><br />Honey-its such a great song that reminds me alot of fantasy.the raps whith ma$e is also good.though normally i hate his style of music.<br /><br />Breakdown-arguably the best and favorite track to everybody whom has this cd.it somewhat reminecent of one sweet day,after all bone thugs-n-harmony is the rap version of boyz ll men.bone doesn't carelessly rap over the beat.their delivery is actually melodic,and mariah's singing is in tone with them.and they actually compliment each other.krayzie for the most part does the hook.but the raps are done by layzie bone(depending on the version of the song),wish bone,and krayzie bone.however in the video all 4 of them are in the video.excluding the fith member bizzy bone.i hope to god she does another song with bone.they have some of the best chemestry ever.she has however worked with krayzie bone exstensively though.(i bet mariah fans didn't know that)<br /><br />me myself being a 5 octave singer i study artists like mariah,and whitney.<br /><br />all in all i love this album.its my favorite mariah cd.and always will be.
B0000630BT|5.0|This is great that some one has finally knocked some sense into Bay-Area-Thrasher.He hates \\"oldschool\\" metal, saying that his queer factory 90's death metal bands are better. I will admit, i'm not into Judas Preist or any of the other \\"old school\\" metal like Iron Maiden,ect(O.K.,i do have a fondness for the Scorpions) but i still respect them for their musicianship and songwritting ability,realizing that with out them all future metal bands would not even be possible or exist,like s h i t t y death metal groups.Bay Area Retard fails to realize this and has his head up his @ss. I definatly give PainKiller it's props, its one of the most devastating albums ever! This is by far the most agressive Preist album and i would like to see Bay Area Retard play just one riff from this album(apparenty he thinks \\"old school\\" metal is simple and childish). Pete Snake, Kudos to you! you know what real music is.He goes overboard with DM which is effing stupid if you ask me. 90% of death metal is really crap, but there are a handfull good/great ones like Death and Possessed, but other then that, its a pretty retarded gendre of music. Even if your tastes are differant, it doesn't give you a right to bash it and say it sucks,like what Bay Area Retard does. Also, if its any clue as to what this dip s h i t really knows, he gave Slayer's R.I.B. a one star review, he must secretly listen to Poison or Bon Jovi or some s h i t like that because R.I.B. is simpley the greatest metal album of all time. <br /> <br />Pete Snake should make more apperances so we can hear his wisdom about metal some more.
B000002AVF|4.0|aahhh yes the most highly debated album among me and some minor aquaintences of mine.the people in question was these 4 white girls and their token racially confused blck female friend.i usually meet these girls at a gym everynow and then.and the popular consensus was that mariah was trying to be black.i believe they was blunt with me cause they thought i was whit but i wasn't,and just played along lol.so i would hear all types of racial undertones to their criticisim of mariah.as if they was betrayed some how.even the racially confused token black girl pretty much felt the same way(man was she brain washed or what lol).i would laugh my ass off on the way home.like mariah i often get mistaken as being white,by both blacks and whites and i'm not even biracial.so i deffinately understand how mariah feels,and its nice to see her be herself.and whom she wants to be.as far as daydream goes i like this album,i like mariah before but this is what drew in her urban audiences.and alienated non urban listeners like the afformentioned dip sticks i met.colaberations with the late great odb,da brat,and even to a lesser exstent boyz ll men scared off alot of suburbanites and some critics aswell. while others applauded her new none conformest image.one sweet day,fantasy,all ways be my baby are pretty much R&B songs.HOWEVER the whole album isn't quite R&B all the way through.but this is just a peak of whats,to come.if this album drew in the urban listeners then her next one would help her keep them.
B00005JMX6|5.0|Before I saw The Girl Next Door, I expected it to be a typical raunchy teen sex movie. After watching it, it has become one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite. It is a love story and a comedy rolled into one. <br /> <br />Emile Hirsch plays Matthew Kidman, a high school senior who is an excellent student and all-around nice kid, but he's kind of nerdy and hasn't really done anything memorable all throughout high school. This changes when he meets his new next-door neighbor Danielle, played by Elisha Cuthbert. Danielle is gorgeous and Matthew instantly falls for her. Soon after spotting her, he sees her undressing through his window and can't help but watch. Danielle catches him watching her and becomes angry at first, but soon it seems as though she has fallen for him too. <br /> <br />Danielle is a former porn star, which Matthew does not find out until his friend Eli (played by Chris Marquette) shows him a video with her in it. To further complicate things, Danielle's former producer/ex-boyfriend Kelly (played by Timothy Olyphant) shows up one day and wants Danielle to return to the adult film business. Kelly and Matthew get along well at first, but this changes when Matthew tries to get Danielle to leave the porn industry, which Kelly does not like one bit. <br /> <br />Eli and Kelly are two characters that really steal the show in this movie. Eli is Matthew's nerdy high school friend who is horny all the time and obsessed with sex and hot women. He had some of the funniest lines in the whole movie. Kelly (the porn director who used to work with Danielle and also used to date her) is the cool, wise-ass guy who cracked me up in just about every scene he was in. I couldn't decide whether to love him or hate him-he is a cool, funny guy when him and Matthew are friends, but when Matthew makes him angry, he becomes psycho and violent. <br /> <br />I do not want to give too much away in this movie, but Danielle gets Matthew to do things that he never imagined hewould do. It really is a case of opposites attracting: Matthew falls for Danielle's wild adventurous side, and Danielle falls for Matthew's innocence and purity. In several scenes, you can tell deep down that Danielle really is a good person, she doesn't really want to be in the porn business, and she really cares about Matthew. Matthew feels the same way about Danielle and puts himself in many risky situations for her. This movie was so touching that I cried in a couple parts, and I don't cry easily. Yet there were also parts so funny I couldn't stop laughing (mainly the scenes with Eli and Kelly.) Definitely worth watching and way under-rated.
B00000I8UF|5.0|This title track has been covered in a wide variety of settings. Ray Charles in the early 60's, and Sergio Mendes, in the late 60's, recorded Moanin'. The real down home version is right here on this disk. <br /> <br />Blue Note wasn't on top yet in the 50's. Prestige was still the hottest label in town. It would take Blue Note about five more years unitl it became THE label to record for. Never the less, Blue Note crancked out some great recordings in the mid 50's like this one here! <br /> <br />This was the first hard bop! Art Blakey started hard bop! This is the epitome of hard bop! Hard bop went on, and turned into so many styles, but this is the first workings of hard bop. Art Blakey got together with Horace Silver to make some great jazz, and invented, hard bop. <br /> <br />There is such an all-star lineup. Lee Morgan, on trumpet,  the greatest trumpet player on the face of the earth. Listen to his solo on Moanin'. It's perfect! Note a bad note! One of the greatest hard bop trumpet solos ever. Such a killer piece. Bluesy, and soulful. <br /> <br />Benny Golson on tenor! What's better than that! That warm tone. Perfect to compliment Morgan's intense trumpet playing. He wrote so many great tunes for this. You think Drum Thunder was written by Art Blakey? Sort of, but no. That's Golson's tune! Fireous, intense! Two great combinations!  <br /> <br />The Blues March, also found on Meet The Jazztet. This is THE version, right here! Art Blakey's pulsing marching beat. They swing it, soulfully here.  <br /> <br />This is a hard bop classic! The beginnings, of hard bop. This is where it's at! Art Blakey, Moanin'.

B00006FIAZ|3.0|I had purchased SOTLB first, and then I had heard the Somberlain in a friend's car one night. I am a HUGE fan of SOTLB, but in all honesty I really think this album best personifies the sound that Dissection was going for. The mental image that appears to me when listening to SOTLB is Jon and his band mates playing on a mountain top in a frozen land, dark empty forests below, chanting their evil song. Chilling. When I hear the Somberlain, it sounds to me like they're in some ancient castle preaching to a gathering of dark priests. I feel exactly like that when I hear the acoustic songs, \\"Into Infinate Obscurity\\", and \\"Feathers Fell\\". A song like \\"Heaven's Damnation\\" just sends chills up my spine. Now that I've spoken of the emotion that the Somberlain evokes, let's talk production. It's sound very garage-like. Primitive might be too strong a description.... I would use that word to describe Darkthrone, but I think that was the sound Fenriz was going for. In many ways, this album remains in the top ranks of best black metal album, but, and I have to say this, it is still 2nd to SOTLB. But honestly, this is only my opinion. Listen to it for yourself and then decide. It will not dissapoint.
B00000JLWW|3.0|If you are looking for an action-packed story about the titanic, you should not watch titanic.  To be honest with you, the movie is long and is not all that interesting throughout.  The only people that i think will find this movie entertaining are people who have a crush on Leonardo DiCaprio.  I was a little disappointed that a tragedy like this was turned into a love story.
0671015206|4.0|Practical, intelligent producers and consumers, frugal low-key living, and great planning help make this minority group one smart gang.  They mostly live well below what they are worth and they live next to you and me, most act like everyday people.   Some are teachers, writers, physicians, and lawyers.  The majority however are small business people and entrepreneurs in both usual and unusual businesses.  Much can be learned from this research...mostly that these folk are risk takers and very independent. You will be able to see then in every community.
B00020BVXI|5.0|The comic book world was done a service when Spiderman was released.  The producers did the best job that was possible in creating a great Spiderman movie.  The actors were good, especially Tobey Maguire.  The only problem that i have with this movie was Kirsten Dunst.  I am not the biggest fan of hers.  I think that she is a snot nosed brat.  Otherwise this is an excellent movie and definitely one to own.

0399241515|5.0|I can't belive the ending...........it left me absolutly speachless. I didn't know what to think, I didn't know what was going to happen. <br /> <br />This is by FAR the best book in the series. <br />Anthony Horowitz must make a new book somehow connecting with this ending. <br />Absolutly breathtaking.
0440234743|5.0|I am not a person who enjoys reading alot....call it adult onset ADHD....self diagnosed.   <br />I picked up a John Grisham book, The Last Juror....couldn't put it down until I finished it.  Immediately started reading A Time to Kill....LOVED IT......Then I read The Bretheren, this one I had a difficult time getting into until the 14th chapter, but soon discovered all the build up was necessary and again I had a hard time putting the book down.  I just finished The Judgment....WOW...read it in two days........LOVED IT the most!!!! <br />I have now read four John Grisham books in about a month, something to be said about that...especially coming from someone who didn't like to read much.  I am completely addicted to his stories and can not wait to start the next.  I just have to decide which one.  Any suggestions?
B00005JNTZ|5.0|If your looking for something with everything, a great cast, story line, and writers who actually know what their doing, seroiusly watch this show & buy it on DVD. Its never boring, funny, sad, crazy but never boring. No matter what you like its got something you'll like and not to mention you'll get hooked on the story line. So yeah I think its a really great show and i dont really like most shows so thats something. Buy this.
B0006U4UAU|4.0|I was irritated with this CD at first and felt it was grossly overhyped.  But, it grows on you.  LCD/JM knows its history and deftly pays homage to a range of styles from elders and contemporaries.  He's flaunting it without taking himself too seriously.  Give it a few listens before rushing to judge (as I initially did).  It's a good album, it just needs to breath a bit.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris has written a book that is extremely well presented and researched. Mr. Harris has the ability to communicate like few others. His grasp of the language and his capability to deduce with logic and reason leaves me inspired.<br /><br />Faith is often confused with goodness.  But when it comes to faith and believing the bible; one has to wonder why any reasonable person would allow themselves to be so gullible.  This belief is rooted in fear and greed.  People are told by the church that if you believe than you will live forever and if you don't than you will be punished until the end of time.  Parents brainwash their own children with this outlandish tail.  How can a supreme being create the universe in 6 days and declare what he saw was good?  And shortly there after start to punish his flawed creations (namely man) for his own imperfect work?  How could a perfect god that knows everything and knows everything that is going to happen overlook that his work was not perfect, and than have to murder scores of innocent men, women, and children in order to try and rectify his own imperfection?  Maybe he should have taken his time with his universe building, and since he seemed to spend most of his thought and work on designing planet earth, I'm sure he really screwed up the billions of other planets with this rush job.  It seems as though the average person spends more time and effort planning for their vacations than the Big Guy spent on the entire master plan.  And it shows!<br /><br />Praying is also a huge component of faith. But praying is nothing more than begging and groveling.  Praying for a new car, a new job.  Praying for someone's health or your own health.  And telling god that he is the king of kings and that he is so wonderful.  These believers are trying to get the all mighty to change his master plan.  How arrogant!  And they usually do this on Sundays, his day off!  Do we really have a supreme being that enjoys all this attention and awe?  Grown adults exhibiting the same behavior that they perceive as so naive; like their six year old that believes in Santa Clause. At least the six year old has an excuse.  I have heard religious families pray at the dinner table; saying \\"thank you lord for the food we are about to eat, please bless it to our bodies to help make us strong.\\"  Two thirds of the world's population goes to bed hungry.  Thirty thousand children (god's most precious gift) in this world die everyday from starvation and malnutrition. Isn't it enough to just say thanks for the food?  Not for these greedy believers.  They want more than a full belly. They want nutritional value as well.  It is not good enough that eating a well balanced meal guarantees good nutrition, they want to make doubly sure by begging for it.  Doesn't god have enough on his plate to worry about concerning his leadership and mechanical deficiencies than to be taking time out of his day dealing with billions and billions of selfish requests?  After all, time is precious to him and he appears to be in a hurry.  Giving him all this extra work may be throwing him off his game.  Again after six days of creating the universe, and believing he got it right, he had to drown everyone but Noah and his gang.  After getting rid of all the bad, he started over again.  Now here we are.  Does he believe that this time he got it right?  I guess he did make us in his own image.
B000063JZQ|4.0|I first watched this rather camp version of Macbeth several years ago.  At the time I thought it was rather good, lots of blood, a villainous Macbeth who goes mad the way we would expect.  So, the other day, after having read the play with my high school Shakespeare class, I thought I'd like to see it again.  I wasn't quite as moved by it the second time, but I did enjoy it.  I find that it lacks punch, and some of the scenes seem poorly produced and directed. Nonetheless, I liked it.  What Polanski lacked in direction, the story carried, so it worked out.  I really liked the last scene.  The sword fight between Macbeth and Macduff was worth the wait.   <br /> <br />Perhaps my biggest disappointment was Lady Macbeth.  I don't know who played the wife, but she didn't pull it off in my view.  Actually, I thought she was lame.   <br /> <br />I would definitely reccomend this version to anyone who hasn't seen it.  It isn't for the public high school setting, as it has too much violence in it, and there is some nudity.  Not that today's teens can't handle a little violence and a little nudity, but I'm sure their parents would give you call later.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|whats the difference between the regular version and the limited edition version???? does anyone know cause im trying to figure out which one to get??? <br /> <br />~~~~MARIAH FAN 4 LYFE;-)~~~~~~~~~~
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|This album is brilliant and different from the previous albums from the queens of the stone age.  They retain alot of the riffs and hard rock style but on alot of tracks homme slows down and allows himself to experiment.  This produces a fantastic varied and tempo shifting record. <br />I think this is QOTSA's led zeppelin III, where \\"Deaf\\" was their II, if anyone knows about zep, I think this is a fitting comparison, as I think the queens are one of the bands of modern times that deserves to be compared on such a level. <br />This is the best record of the year so far and one of the best of this century so far as well
B0007P3582|3.0|After I initially heard the track \\"How To Rob\\", where 50 basically made a comedy rap about how he was going to \\"jack\\" all the popular r&b artists and rappers of their \\"goodies\\", I hadn't heard too much from Curtis Jackson.  One day my roomate came to me and said that I got some new 50 Cent for you.   The CD turned out to be \\"Guess Who's Back\\", which was a collection of songs and freestyles from when 50 was signed to Columbia. <br /> <br />Everyone knows 50's life story by now, so I am just going to stick to the music.   After listening to \\"Guess Who's Back\\" a couple of times, I realized that 50 had legitimate skills.   Then, a couple of months after \\"Guess Who's Back\\", I started to hear all of these songs that 50 and his G Unit had on mixtapes.   One inparticular was \\"Banks' Victory\\".  On this track, 50 and Lloyd Banks used the beat that Biggie, Puffy and Busta Rhymes made famous and created a song of their own.   This would be the trend as the G Unit also did \\"After My Cheddar\\" instead of LL's \\"Luv U Better\\" and \\"You Should Be Here\\" instead of Raphael Saadiq's and D Angelo's \\"Be Here\\".   50 and his crew started picking up steam in the streets and the street buzz ended up getting 50 a deal with Eminem's Shady Records.   Success started going to 50's head real quick, but his first real mainstream smash \\"Wanksta\\" matched 50's confidence.   50 was sending some jabs and punches over to his main nemesis Ja Rule and it seemed as if 50 was ready to take the rap world by storm.   The follow up song to \\"Wanksta\\" was \\"In Da Club\\" which was produced by Dr. Dre and originally made for Eminem's crew D 12.   When D 12 didn't want the track, 50 quickly snatched it up and from there it's history as 50's \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" sold and is continuing to sell more than 11 million units worldwide.    Since then G Unit's \\"Beg For Mercy\\", Lloyd Banks' \\"The Hunger For More\\", Young Buck's \\"Straight Outta Cashville\\" and The Game's \\"The Documentary\\", which are all G Unit record releases, have all gone platinum.   <br /> <br />50 was eagerly anticipating a chance to make another solo CD.   However, after listening to \\"The Massacre\\" you can tell that success has clearly gone to 50 Cent's head.   Just because you are making money and everything around G Unit is successful, that doesn't mean that you can neglect becoming a better artist. <br /> <br />\\"The Massacre\\" was released in early March.  However, The Game's CD which was released in January featured 50 on the 1st 2 singles \\"How We Do\\" and \\"Hate It Or Love It\\".  As much as many people will \\"hate\\" on 50, you can't say that the man is stupid.   This along with a mixtape and his tracks \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Disco Inferno\\" also on the radio, 50 knew what he was doing.  50 also had the buzz of a diss track entitled \\"Piggybank\\", which he said a couple of choice words about Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Shyne and Nas.   Although, the track was overrated, the buzz was enough to make people willing to buy \\"The Massacre\\" just so they could hear that song, if they hadn't heard the song already. <br /> <br />\\"The Massacre\\" starts off with \\"In My Hood\\".   This track is a good way to get the CD started as 50 tries to let people know that he has not strayed too far from the style that he had on \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\".   \\"This Is 50\\" has a nice beat produced by Black Jeruz and Sha Money XL, but 50 doesn't take advantage of that fact as his lyrical content doesn't hold to the weight of the tight beat.   \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" will remind many people of \\"Many Men\\" from \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\".   Although \\"Many Men\\" is better, \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" is one of the better songs on \\"The Massacre\\".   \\"Gatman & Robbin'\\" would be better if it didn't sound so forced.  It seems as if this track was put on the CD just so this CD could be released with an Eminem verse on it.   \\"Outta Control\\" is one of only two tracks that Dr. Dre contributed to \\"The Massacre\\", with \\"Gunz Come Out\\" being the other.   I actually like this songbecause it's very catchy just like \\"In Da Club\\" was.   However, it seems as if 50 was taking the easy way out, because I think this sound could even be better than it actually is if 50 would have stepped the lyrical content up.  50 admits that he is not a better lyricist than his G Unit crew, but he is a better songwriter.   However, because of his success to me it seems as if 50 is settling for tracks because he knows that he is going to sell regardless.   <br /> <br />Although, many people wouldn't agree on Hi Tek wasting tracks on 50.   \\"Get In My Car\\" and \\"Ryder Music\\" are very catchy songs and are 2 songs that rank right up there with the best songs on \\"The Massacre\\".  50 composes verses to the infectious beats and the 50/Hi Tek formula definitely works.   \\"The Ski Mask Way\\" has 50 staying loyal to the street as he spits verses just like he did before he got the $1 million deal.   \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" is the only concept type of song on this CD.   50 ties rock stars and habits of particular people into one theme.   The concept ends up working and you just wish that 50 would have more songs like these and not the typical I'm rich and I have a ski mask on type songs.  \\"Just A Lil Bit\\" is \\"The Massacre's\\" current single.  Scott Storch who also produced Candy Shop and \\"Build You Up\\" which features Jamie Foxx, has a club formula going for 50 just like Scott Storch and Fat Joe's Terror Squad had with \\"Lean Back\\".   The formula works because these songs are catchy where Fat Joe and the Terror Squad actually have lyrics tied behind the beats, 50 just has catchy verses.   \\"My Toy Soldier\\" features Tony Yayo and this track is a rebellious sequel to Eminem's \\"Like Toy Soldiers\\" from his \\"Encore\\" CD.   Where Eminem was trying to bring peace and resoultion to issues, 50 wants to be himself and keep the war going, which isn't too smart with all the enemies that 50 already has.   \\"God Gave Me Style\\" has 50 giving props to the man above and is a nice change of pace to allof the sex, violence and money talk that is all over \\"The Massacre\\".   \\"I Don't Need 'Em\\" is a pretty good track, but just as one amazon reviewer already pointed out, the beat is the exact same track that Ghostface, Styles P, and Sheek Louch rapped to called \\"Metal Lungies\\" from Ghostface's \\"The Pretty Tony Album\\".   Having the roots of New York that 50 does, I am sure that he knew that, but as always, he didn't care.   \\"The Massacre\\" finishes off well with a remix to \\"Hate It Or Love It\\" which will be the first and last time that 50, The Game, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck will all appear on the same track. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"The Massacre\\" is a pretty good CD.  However, you would think since 50 knows that he is going to sell CDs regardless that he would spend more time trying to set trends and improve his lyrical content.  However, it seems as if 50's skills are regressing and not progressing.   You would have thought that he wouldn't have released 2 more volumes of \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\", which this CD actaully is since there are 21 actual songs on this CD.   50 seems to be content with making money, being cocky and dissin' whoever he wants to for no apparent reason.  He even dissed the great Dr. Dre once him and The Game started not seeing eye to eye.   Anyone that is not willing to wait for Dr. Dre to produce more tracks on their CD clearly has ego problems. That's not what this rap game is all about.   Back in the Boogie Down Productions' days, if you wanted to battle you would put a beat on and battle lyrically.   You wouldn't diss someone just because you don't personally like the decisions they have made.  One day 50 will get it.  When that one day is?  I have no idea. <br /> <br />James' Top 5 <br /> <br />1) Hate It Or Love It (Remix) w/The Game, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo & Young Buck <br />2) I'm Supposed To Die Tonight <br />3) In My Hood <br />4) Get In My Car <br />5) Outta Control
B00013RC9I|5.0|Air has done it again. Not since their '98 album, Moon Safari has one of their ventures been so solid. Air paints layers of dreamy colors over landscapes that soothe the senses. The songs are catchy, mostly in the very subtle details. It seems the more you listen, the more you appreciate, and want to listen again and again. With all the garbage on the airwaves these days, find refuge in this cool collection of grooves.
0440237688|5.0|Two parents complained that their child should not be reading this. The schools decided to make the book unavailable to 10 year olds, but leave it in middle schools. Censorship is disgusting and without even reading it I give it a 5 star rating. (My kids have read it and said it was very good - as is all of Lowry's stuff!)
B0007GAERG|5.0|(nevermind the alliteration) <br /> <br />Mariah's new album \\"The Emacipation of Mimi,\\" is one of her best albums, both vocally and artistically. She has truly found herself with this record because she finally found a genre to stick to. She's no longer ambiguous. <br /> <br />The album itself is awesome. It flourishes in the retro 70s-soul child reverie that Mariah's hinted at on her \\"Charmbracelet\\" album with track \\"Subtle Invitation\\". While that track stuck out as the oddball of that particular set, if she would have put it on this album it would have been quite at home. Listening to it, I remember the late 70s-early 80s R&B music my dad used to listen to when I was growing up. I remember it's free-flowing, organic, unpretentious nature. Mariah remembers that scene well too. Especially on the slower moving and midtempo numbers. <br /> <br />My favorite track, right off the bat, is \\"Get Your Number\\" which features Jermaine Dupri (doing his best, and well executed, impression of Nelly). <br /> <br />\\"Circles\\" and \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" are two tracks that stand out vocally for Mariah. They're old school Motown and gospel feel is an area that she feels greatly comfortable. <br /> <br />Anyways, check it out... <br />
1401301010|1.0|I was looking forward to Kiedis' book, having been a RHCP's fan from way back. What a disappointment. Kiedis brags about his sex life endlessly, I found myself looking forward to his next relapse back onto drugs to relieve the monotomy of what sexual act some random chick performed on him. Kiedis occasionally showcases his masterful (ahem)lyric writing ability by displaying some of his lyrics throughout the book. Thank you Mr Kiedis for highlighting the true talents of the RHCP.
B00008EY65|5.0|I may have written about 5 reviews in the last 5 years. I only review when I think something is very good or very bad. I watched this movie when it came out in the theaters and many more times on DVD, so that I'm not writing out of sheer excitement from having just seen the movie.<br /><br />Having said all that, let me just say that I can watch this movie over and over and over and still feel like I can watch it over and over again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br /><br />Even though I loved it, this movie is not for everyone. Here are some things that may bother you: slicing and cutting with swords; a stab in the neck; impalement; explosions; some good guys die; kids being mean to a girl; fire; many ugly monsters from medium size to huge; evil \\"nazi\\" creatures; suspense under water;  etcetera. Oh, and some kitties almost get hurt.
B0008JFMEC|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this is an excellent idea. Who really wants to play $250-$400 on a portable DVD player? Not me, i am not made of money. i would rather carry around a portable gaming device/mp3 player/movie player/picture viewer for $250+ than spend more on a DVD player alone. The one thing that i do think is an annoyance would have to be the price. Some people probably have these DVD's and would probably not want to buy them again just to see them on their PSP. I am in this position becuase i am an avid DVD collector. I do agree with the previous reviewer about the DVD/UMD packs. They should lower the UMD price to $10.00 at the most. If they don't do something, i think that the UMD market might crash, and that would not be very good now would it?
B0002X314C|2.0|When I first heard \\"Ordinary People\\" I was excited. I thought to myself, \\"Is this really happening? Are people actually making REAL music again?\\" So I rushed out and got the CD and someone swore to me that it was \\"really good.\\" Well, I went home and popped it into the CD player and let me tell you,  the CD is wack.  If you can play the piano and all, why do you have to sample from a Staple Singers song? And I couldn't relate to any of the songs at all. I have never cheated with anybody and I have never used drugs and/or alcohol. I don't need dope to cope. Maybe John was hinting a suggestion with the titles \\"Let's Get Lifted\\" and \\"Let's Get Lifted Again\\": smoke some dope and you won't notice how wack the CD is. The songs in the beginning of the CD sound completely different than the songs in the end. It doesn't flow at all and it's so obvious. The only decent songs are \\"Ordinary People\\" and \\"It Don't Have to Change.\\" That's too bad because this CD had a lot of potential. Well, I got played AGAIN, so here are the lessons I learned:<br /><br />1)  If a new R&B artists  is claimed to be the next Big Thing and is compared to *real*  legendery artists (ie: Stevie Wonder, Teddy Pendegrass, Billie Holiday) you better beware. What it usually means is that a mediocre performer is copping someone else's style and most of you are going to be dumb enough to buy the CD. Then after you listen to it, you're in denial. You know that it sucks, but you feel bad for wasting your money and you hype yourself up by saying \\"This is the best album of 2005! John Legend *is* a legend! He's so much like Curtis Mayfield! He's *better* than Curtis Mayfield!\\"<br /><br />2) If someone tells you that wack R&B albums like \\"Get Lifted\\" are \\"really good,\\" you also better beware because 99% these folks have never listed to real R&B music. To be real, they don't even like real R&B music unless it's sampled in some stupid rap or pop song. It's too much *soul* for them.<br /><br />3) Neo-soul sucks. There's nothing soulful about. Just a bunch of frontin', stylin', and samplin'.'s nothing soulful about. Just a bunch of frontin', stylin', and samplin'.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah Carey's voice is definitely back, y'all! Personally I don't think it ever left. If you listen to media and publicly snubbed Glitter more closely, you'll hear absolute perfect vocal on \\"Lead The Way\\".  Her voice simply soars on this latest Mimi set, especially on gospel old school r&b track Fly Like A Bird. Why hide that amazing 5 octave off the hook range? Mariah incorporates her still amazing, goose pimple pipes effectively throughout. It's like this, Beyonce and Christina! Pounding dance floor grooves and her trademark ballads dominate, only now with more hip hop flare and sparkling enthusiasm. Rap is pushed aside to focus on her voice, smart move! One complaint: want more tunes like the closing track, very inspiring and uplifting, spiritual. Mimi, please cut a gospel-based theme cd in the near future. Bet the record company that dropped her previously is now eating their blank cds? Moral of emancipation: Never diss a true diva who can actually sing...
B0007GAERG|2.0|Back in the day, I was Mariah Carey's #1 fan. But as time went by, something happened and I'm not sure what it was. Either I outgrew her, she started to become wack, or it was BOTH. 'Rainbow' was the *last* CD I bought of Mariah's and it was awful. It didn't even look good with my other MC CD's, so I got rid of it.<br /><br /> Mariah started going downhill back when her 'Butterfly' album came out when she wanted to be down with the hip-hip thang. Now it's '05 and she's decided come out with another album, even though she's old, almost played out, and hasn't done anything innovative for years. And since when was she known as 'Mimi'? She's just trying to be like Janet Jackson with the 'Damita Jo' thing, her alto ego. Whatever!<br /><br /> Mariah's style is stale and she knows it. The songs on \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" sound like any other garbage you hear on the radio: all wack, no originality, and no substance. I didn't enjoy any of them. She's still doing the hoarse whisper/shrieking style of singing that she's been done for a long time now.  And I really don't understand why it's so necessary to have some rapper on an album. Nelly is the worse. All of his rhymes sound the same and each verse ends with \\"Oh!\\". And Mariah's still sampling, too. \\"Get Your Number\\" samples from \\"Just an Illusion\\" by Imagination. Anway, get this album at your own risk. Thank goodness I didn't buy it!
B000066744|5.0|The premise, the music, the performances!  This movie is a gem.  I have been a \\"movie buff\\" since the days of the Saturday double feature with an eleven cent admission charge.  I know not how many movies I have seen but I do know this is one of the finest.  How wonderful motion pictures such as this can be so \\"hidden\\" is beyond me.  I urge you to purchase this one for your library.  You will not be sorry.  I will say, if you are a Vin Diesel fan, this picture is not for you.  This movie has a soul and charm.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I am a huge Alien(s) fan. This special boxed set edition has virtually everything a die-hard could ever ask for. If you can afford it (the price is not that bad when you consider you're getting NINE DVDs) then GO FOR IT!  <br /> <br />ALIEN: Definitely the most skilled production of the four. Ridley Scott is no fool and his approach of encapsulating so much of our fears in the form of the Alien is masterful. This is what irritated me so much about Alien v Predator. Whoever directed that had no concept of what it means to be subtle. If you look at Scott's rendering, the Alien is hardly ever seen. It is virtually always hidden in part in darkness, which adds so much more mystery and terror to its existence. DEFINITELY A MUST BUY!   10/10 <br /> <br />ALIENS: JAmes Cameron has a completely different take on how to tackle the Alien as humankind's other. Instead of making a gothic, horror-like film, Cameron opts instead for the action-adventure one, reminisant of his Terminator films. He masterfully delays the suspense and the first view of the Alien itself comes only HALF WAY into the film. INCREDIBLE! 9/10 <br /> <br />ALIENS 3: Fincher's production has been severly criticised by many people, though I can't see why. The yellow-brown hazy colours and the sense of the audience seeing through the eye of the Alien itself is INCREDIBLE. I thought this film was very well made! 9/10 <br /> <br />ALIEN RESSURECTION: Outstanding special effects but the film loses much of its former glory in Jeunet's hands. When I first heard about it I thought \\" In Aliens 3, Riply hurls herself into a pool of LAVA!! - but trust hollywood to come up with a sequel to even that\\". The film is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be but it certainly reads like a bit of a jumble sale with the odd good scene here and there. AVERAGE but STILL WORTHY OF BEING ADDED TO THE SET 6/10 <br /> <br />
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I was lucky enough to witness the releasing of \\"WDADU, IAW and Awake\\", and also \\"SFAM\\" each of which can be classified as milestones in progressive music history. After listening to this album, I ended up having some doubts about the band's future. However I have to admit that, after they had released \\"Falling into Infinity\\", I was almost sure that they were finished, but they released two other magnificent albums, \\"SFAM\\", (one of the best albums ever) and \\"6 degrees\\". So when it comes to DT you never know what's going to happen next.    There are a couple of things that bothers me about DT and TOT. Firstly, sometimes I felt like I was listening to Metallica or other bands instead of DT. \\"As I am\\" is like the DT version of \\"Enter Sandman\\". \\"This dying soul\\"- which is one of the best in the album - has some vocal parts very similar to \\"Blackened\\". Endless Sacrifice resembles \\"Senatorium\\" (and also \\"How will I laugh tomorrow...\\", by Suicidal Tendencies). The first part of the final guitar solo in \\"This Dying Soul\\" is definitely from Al Di Meola's \\"Race with the Devil on the Spanish Highway\\". The songs are better than good, but having seen many times what they are capable of, I'd like to witness better and absolutely original songwriting from DT. We saw bits and chunks from Rush, Pantera, Metallica and some other bands in the past, but this case had never been so dominant and obvious.    The songs in TOT not only lacks originality but also feeling. I felt that the songs were written because thay had to be written, like solving a mathematical formula, or doing homework. I see that DT is releasing albums after albums, DVDs after DVDs. I am actually happy that they are selling good and making money because they are first class musicians and they deserve the best. However vice versa also applies, hence, we deserve the best as we have been supporting DT for years.    In my point of view, the biggest problem lies somewhere else. In the albums like, \\"WDADU\\", IAM\\", \\"Awake\\" andalso \\"Scenes from a Memory\\", every drum fill, every note played meant something, because they were written brilliantly, seemed to come from the heart, played with virtuosity and most important of all, they were used economically. In TOT, -same signals also were slightly visible in 6 degrees- all the songs seem to turn into a show of virtuosity. Especially Petrucci and Portnoy deserves some criticism in this department. If somebody holds a light into your eyes constantly, you will get used to it after a while, however if the light comes occasionally, it affects more. Maybe some fans love this constant show of virtuosity and think it's cool, but I feel it has started to dominate and deteriorate the overall quality of the music. Virtuosity should serve the music, but vice versa is not acceptable. I am not saying \\"less is more\\", but \\"more is definitely not always more\\".
B00005JMXX|3.0|This could be our future someday. I thought this movie <br />would suck, since it's all special FX. The story held <br />my attention, and the special FX were great! If you have <br />a huge t.v. like me, you'll really love it! It's a fun flick.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Concept albums may be a sign of an artist who has some kind of concept of what they're doing or trying to achieve. Although not exactly as elaborate and exact as Ice Cube's \\"Death Certificate\\", \\"The diary of Alicia Keys\\" at the very least, serves as a closer look into the pain and passion of the woman who somehow became a suspiciously light-skinned, long-haired, monster record company-backed motive in the eyes of hard core neo-soul lovers for India Arie's consistent snubbing at award time during 2001-2002.<br /><br />For those in that category wishing for a sophomore jinx, forget it. At best, the rich-melodied, mysterious brush on the lips that was \\"Songs in A Minor\\" has pretty much flowered into a slow, well-timed, open- mouthed kiss with \\"The Diary...\\" The issue here is whether or not you're getting enough tongue out of the deal to want to close your eyes. \\"The Diary...\\" begins with \\"Harlem's Nocturne,\\" a classical intro- the type of musical sophistication that stood her out from the pack with her debut. It patiently builds tension into a modernized, haunting track of her inviting everyone into her musical diary, where each song may very well be a page.<br /><br />\\"Karma\\" does not disappoint for the jilted, backed by a laid-back beat and a violin that sounds like sparrow in distress, Keys gives a classy middle finger to a dude back for another chance after ruining what once was. Immediately, you see that Keys' homespun wisdom from \\"Songs...\\" was not a marketed ploy for the older demographic. Girlfriend got some old-school schooling from her moms. The background singing will have you checking liner notes to find Lauryn Hill's name. The break beat even reminds you of the whole Fugee crew in their heyday.<br /><br />\\"Heartburn\\" is a cute foray into uptempo, James-Brown type, seventies funk. The song seems too tentative on both the horn arrangement and Key's vocals to turn the \\"this-could-wind-up-as-a-jingle-behind-some-Tum's-Antacid-commercial\\" corner and get onto the \\"stay-in-your-car-even-when-it's-parked-until-the-song-is-finished\\" street. \\"Dragon Days\\" seems conflicted in this regard, though it's stylistic indecision will be palatable enough to the clueless, Ashanti mall crowd. \\"If I was your woman/Walk on By\\" is driven by the hypnotic \\"No Other Love\\" beat that made Faith Evan's debut album hard to shake. Key's use of it here, again, sounds like someone who appreciates the effect it had on her as opposed to some hip hop producer strong arming her into short cuts. The remake here is executed well enough in a fresh new light to have younguns thinkin' it's a brand new song while the old schoolers hum the lyrics off to themselves.<br /><br />If you don't know \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" by now, you don't know black radio. Here producer Kanye West has Keys give up some tongue for real about her not being noticed by a guy who frequents a caf&eacute; she once waitressed. The lazy tinkling of the ivories massages you right at your temples while the bass drum seems sympathetic to a heartbeat in rapture. The doo-wop background singing sets up the best female macking this century. I have seen stone cold players set their drinks to the side and cover their smiling mouths when Keys pulls the cell phone \\"breaking up\\" move. \\"If I ain't got you\\" was born somewhere in the seventies with its return to the importance of love and relationships. Many half-cooked neo soul artists attempt this, substituting raw feeling with practiced vocal runs and posturing, Keys shows genuine emotion in the vocal delivery of keys and the background - which lightly scratches at the top of your throat the way cigarette smoke - or fighting the urge to cry - does.<br /><br />\\"Diary\\" deserves recognition solely for bringing in Tony! Toni! Tone!, the most consistently breaking up contemporary soul band around. The arrangement gives a mature, easy going feel that almost impatiently invites you to walk hand in hand with her over turbulent waters. And I will say it here and now, Keys sounds like India Arie in the first verse and other moments in it!<br /><br />\\"Wake up\\", is mellowed call to quit ego games within a relationship. Yes, we've heard this before, but this one is notable because Keys doesn't come off like a frantic, pillow clutching Mary J. Blige victim or the super hard \\"I hate men motif\\" that's becoming as tired as bling-bling. This one's evolved because Keys addresses both she and the man's possible contributions the problem. \\"So Simple\\" slides by Lauryn Hill's neck of the woods, continuing the conversation Keys starts in \\"Wake Up\\", sampling what sounds like Lauryn in \\"Ex-Factor.\\"<br /><br />\\"Nobody not really\\", has a jazzy, experimental flavor like Tina Marie in her \\"Portuguese In Love\\" era. Fleeting moments of humility and desperation waft over this track. You can see Keys as a girl on her back in bed, staring at the ceiling with her diary and pen on her belly, wondering why to even bother writing another word. It's a dangerous thought for an artist and seems unfinished in its resolution, especially in being the last song on the CD.<br /><br />\\"When You Really Love Someone\\" is clearly the continuation of \\"Song...'s\\" \\"A Woman's Worth.\\" It may seem redundant message-wise and may delve too heavily in the \\"Fallin'\\" melody range but again, the vocal delivery's baffling; how can someone that young come with it like a forty-something woman whose lived fast and hard?<br /><br />There is no one else in Keys' generation willing to say what she's saying here. This kind of love is what an elderly lady once defined to me as \\"dirty draw's, mix-match socked, Corinthians 13 kinda love.\\" The kind that is not sexy, flashy, or selfish enough to be in style. The kind too powerful to have background music behind it when in movies. Grown ass love. Damn the classic musicianship, the politics of her 80's-friendly looks and universal marketability. This is truly Keys' greatest gift.<br /><br />[...]it here and now, Keys sounds like India Arie in the first verse and other moments in it!  <br /> <br />\\"Wake up\\", is mellowed call to quit ego games within a relationship.

B000001EL3|4.0|Despite all that's been said and written about KISS and this album in particular, \\"King of the Nighttime World\\" is their absolute best song, ever.  Why???  Well, I'm glad you asked.  First, they didn't write most of it.  Though they were decent writers in their heyday (right around this time), in the pantheon of rock, that's not what they're known for, nor will their legacy be that of great songs.  Like it or not, it's the make up and stage show that will endure in the public's collective mind(s).  I read that a friend of Paul Stanley's told him about this band that was playing clubs (I forget exactly where) in late '75, or so, and they had this one song that would make a great KISS song.  Paul heard the song and/or saw the band play the song, and said he agreed.  Well, since this unknown band wasn't going any place special, and no doubt they were hungry to make some money, they agreed to let Paul/KISS have the song, under the condition that Paul would add a little something and they would get due writing credit.  And this is how \\"King of the Nighttime World\\" ended up on \\"Destroyer\\".  Listening to it today, it still stands out as the one KISS song that has everything KISS tried to put into their music, and sums up the entire KISS experience all at once.  From the killer beginning to the right on target lyrics, from the great melody to the cool changes (and Gene's great walking bass line) and solo (whether Ace did it or not, we'll probably never know), not to mention the staggered ending, this song is pure rock and roll, something KISS (almost) always strove for, but didn't always attain.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Finally, middle class rap with enough soul to pass the \\"real nigga\\" test...Kanye West is a nouveau-riche, urbanized, seething, two-fisted pro-black advocating, pants sagging b-boy struggling with Christian values in a world of mind numbing materialism, knee-buckling sexualization and outright self-hatred. Just like most of us. West's \\"College Drop Out\\" boldly sets up this engaging debut album in the atmosphere officially deemed the antithesis of the hyper-machismo of the ghetto (i.e. blackness/black manliness).<br /><br />  That's right, Polo rocking, blazer-friendly K Wizzle represents from the milieu of the college campus. The best example of this is \\"School Spirit.\\" Spike Lee's \\"School Daze\\" was the last artistic offering to pull this off with any resounding success.<br /><br />West's achievement is fascinating after seeing scores of brothers stroll the yard on FAMU's, Morehouse's (the heterosexual ones) and Howard's campuses trying to be hard with backpacks ripping at the seams from Calculus, Philosophy and Humanities textbooks. West's album is monumental to such men who've been through an identity crisis thanks to the pressure by the media, the 'hood and many of the women they've tried to pursue on these campuses. Kanye West and the pensive teddy bear mascot gracing the album cover are the poster children for surviving academia and maintaining street credibility.<br /><br />A strange position for an album named \\"College Drop Out\\", yet there lies a method to West's schizophrenia. \\"We Don't Care\\" is West shouting out to the ghetto right off the top, to the drug dealers that had to do something to keep they peoples afloat, the Tyrone Squares slaving 9 to 5's, even bootleggers trying to get by, as if letting the audience know off the top that his academic presentation is without the snobbery that tends to breed hatred of the talented tenth. This gives him the persona of the cat in school that enjoyed asking questions that made teachers look stupid. So you figure, since he's pissing off the administration that put you in a learning disability class because the teachers didn't teach worth a damn, you'll take a rain check on trying to beat him down in the hallway - for a while. \\"Graduation Day\\" endears even more. West laments that he does not wish to do the good-job-predictable-rigamarole every parent seems to wish for their child. West captures the spirit of entrepreneurship hip hop has inspired beautifully with the final line, stating that \\"I'm just not everybody.\\"<br /><br />\\"All Falls Down\\" is the best commentary on the rampant materialism of our time in recent memory. From females \\"addicted to retail\\" to insecure thug wannabes who can't run to grocery store without a throwback jersey, West goes off like a dentist in a bad mood; not only takes it to the teeth, but drivin' it down in the gums, rattling your skull with how such materialism is not a sign of black cool, but honestly, self hatred medicated by brand name clothing.<br /><br />Most of hip hop will have you believe people in the 'hood are born Sunday night and are in some kind of criminal drama by Monday at noon. With \\"Spaceship\\", West adds passion and depth to the tedious, monotonous grind of young people working at bland gigs at The Gap while waiting for a come up. The most powerful song is \\"Jesus Walks.\\" West lets his hang strong by summoning a force that scares most contemporary rappers, God (Jesus in this instance). West is the only one to throw down reverently about such a sacred topic and drop the f-bomb in it like it was meant to be there. The most stunning part is West's lamenting that radio stations actually gave him beef about the song simply because of his talking about God. Can you remember a time when talking about most of the garbage you hear on the radio now was kept you off the air?<br /><br />In \\"Never Let Me Down\\", Jay Z actually lets West down with a tired, self-centered rap about his self-proclaimed king of rap status and how high his records chart. No way in hell can that stand shoulder to shoulder with West's recounting of his mother's participation in the Civil Rights Movement, West promising to marry his betrothed and surviving a near fatal car accident. This brings home the odd marriage between someone of substance like West, and the predictable Johnson-stroking of everyone surrounding Jay Z and Rocafella.<br /><br />Tired of West's deepness? Fear not. Instead of coming off over the top as a self-righteous nerd, Kanye retains his sense of humor and bares his contradictions. Recess from the deep-thinking is in session: \\"Get 'em High\\" is West wading through a weed-induced haze, swearing to be the big baller (...) that will bone your girl, diss your demo and demand you dance to this exciting news. The most interesting part of this is the fact that Talib Kweli is featured here in pure wing man mode, setting West up at one point to impress a girl right out her draws. Hey, intellectuals gotta get laid too, right?<br /><br />\\"The New Workout Plan\\" is along the same line of silliness, bringing mega beats per minute. It features testimonies of chickenheads blessed with the new Kanye West workout body now able to score that drug dealer or ball player that used to pass them and their jelly rolls by. \\"Breathe in, Breathe Out\\" dabbles in and out of commentary. Here, West apologizes to Mos Def and Talib Kweli for his forthcoming burst into typical rap subject matter. His self-consciousness almost makes this one notable.<br /><br />\\"Slow Jamz\\", featuring Jamie Foxx, is something for the ladies tired of trying to kill themselves keeping up with hyper-tempo hip hop ('specially in them pointed boots). Foxx comes with the crooning he first showcased in his \\"Crazy Like a Fox\\" show. Ready for the World, New Edition, Luther Vandross... they all get love, strolling through the chorus like the ticker tape messages on the CNN channel. Rapper and fellow Chicagoan Twista's cameo is the true birth of his career.<br /><br />The Interlude of the Caucasian-sounding college graduate is important because, indirectly, he states that a college degree isn't a deliverance into the promise land as many Civil Rights era elders may lead us to believe. In fact, as the interlude infers (almost ala Carter G. Woodson's \\"Mis-Education of the Negro\\"), the training is useless if the graduates aren't trained to use what they learn to further themselves and their communities. Honestly, even at HBCU's, many of us are trained to think as part of a priviledged black herd merely waiting to be sold off to the nearest corporation - with no further interest in from whence we came. \\"Family Business\\" pries the day planner out of our hands and connects us back to our roots, the ugly and affirming aspects of it while \\"Through the Wire\\" mumbles the message to those of us still assuming ourselves invincible that every breath we take is a gift.<br /><br />Ain't that something, after the legacy Tupac has left us, it is obvious that we don't seem to need somebody perfect, close at Public Enemy may have been to it.

0143034901|2.0|It seems that this novel polarises readers and i'm afraid that i tend to the south pole more than the north. While the story is calculated to entrance and captivate i agree with the reviewers who were disappointed by the flatness of the characters and the boring predictability of the storyline. What more can i say about a novel full of breathless heroines with heaving bosoms, dastardly cigar-smoking villains, mysterious strangers and comic-relief sidekicks. Comparisons with Eco, Marquez etc are fatuous. This novel would win my nomination for the Bulwer-Lytton purple prose award.
B0002X314C|4.0|Admit it, you didn't expect him to look like he does... nah, you said to yourself, `that cat on the cover must be a model. Some kind of Milli Vanilli scam up in here...' You wanted to check your CD cover again like many people who heard his voice before they saw him; it's been a while since we've all heard anyone sound as composed, yet soulful... honestly, we don't know what someone with such a polished, dignified sound as his should look like. We're used to cats looking like they're set to detail our cars while dodging a case on the low.<br /><br />John Legend sounds like P. Diddy's Carl Thomas, with an extra five years of wisdom added to his lyrics and delivery. It might have something to do with Kanye West's production, here mellowed down to showcase each and every nuance. Simply put, the tracks are devoid of the hyper-speed oldie cut as the backdrop formula West is been known for. Legend's mannered, robust presence is without the teenage gangsta-hormonal rage and works well with the white T to blazer crowd. The lyrics of \\"Get Lifted\\" are vague enough to pack various allusions, weed and the proverbial leg-twitching orgasm to end all included, yet there is a comfortable quality to Legend's delivery that will keep you from ever seeing him as ribald as the comparable David Hollister.<br /><br />\\"Used To Love U\\" ushers in an earnest quality that never fades. Its lyrics reveal the self-doubt that Kanye's \\"The College Dropout\\" stood out for by telling the story of a guy who is afraid he does not have enough swagger and calculated hood status (circa Destiny's Child \\"Soldier\\" to keep the woman of his affections:<br /><br />\\"Baby, It's me... Maybe I bore you/ No, No it's my<br /><br />fault cause I can't afford you/<br /><br />Maybe baby Puffy, Jay Z/Could all be better for you/<br /><br />Cause all I could do was love you\\"<br /><br />Getting bored with the middle class sterility? Enter \\"Alright\\", Legend's attempt at being a drunken, ballsy player that doesn't give a damn about staring females down even if their man's right next to them. Okay, so that level of badass recklessness comes off as convincing as Tevin Campbell screaming thug-life, but Legend fares better with \\"She Don't Have To Know\\" where he reasons with the other woman to stay clear of his home front. This one comes off reminiscent of classic Bill Withers.<br /><br />So now you can't sleep on the bourgie/neo (never mind, I won't say it)-whatever Legend, mild-mannered as he may seem; Clark Kent here can catch wreck with a red cape and be a ho like the rest of the badasses women love to try and tame. Speaking of that, Legend's got the soundtrack to that there, too with the Staple Singers' cheerful \\"Let's Do It Again\\"-tinged \\"I Can Change.\\" Both Kanye's and Legend's arrangements are irresistible, making Snoop Dogg's cameo the cool, thin, after-dinner mint after a hearty dinner.<br /><br />\\"Ordinary People\\" is one of the most elegant, honest love songs of 2004 and 2005. It wades in the uncertainty of relationships with a realism that is not destined for doom or stuck in fairytale mode. \\"Stay With You\\" has a content, homely, almost country feel that gives you the notion to watch your children play in the yard and smile or take your naked feet and rub them on something warm-blooded while under the covers. \\"Let's Get Lifted Again\\" has a Native American, almost meditative tone. This time the allusions aren't as plentiful as the previous \\"Lifted\\". Ol' boy's definitely on some peyote tip this time. \\"It Don't Have To Change\\" is a tender tribute to the family, complete Legend's (aka John Stephens) own family (The Stephens Family). With only fingersnaps, reverb and piano, Legend's full-bodied voice leads his family well in a song that should find its way to every family reunion.<br /><br />\\"Live It Up\\" is the most likable, believable ode to conspicuous consumption of our generation. Without the bitterness and juvenile taunting of material goods you find in hip hop, Legend sings of he and his woman busting their asses over the years to keep a roof over their heads and finally coming to a point in their lives where their hard work has paid off. Speaking of which, nine years as choir director for his local church has definitely rewarded Legend. His talent needs no updated slang or trendy sound effects to keep him relevant and in rotation. Nice guys can finish in grand style (and be destined to last longer than the others) after all.<br /><br />[...]of he and his woman busting their asses over the years to keep a roof over their heads and finally coming to a point in their lives where their hard work has paid off.

B0006SSOHC|4.0|While it may not break a lot of new ground, this is a movie that, at the very least, makes the viewer think more than do the majority of horror films.  For that alone, it deserves credit. <br /> <br />An earlier reviewer mentioned, \\"The Usual Suspects,\\" and I think that's a somewhat apt one to use.  This film has no lack of possibilities as to who could be the \\"Jigsaw Killer,\\" and it really does keep you guessing until the end.  There are a number of violent scenes that I wouldn't recommend for anyone who may be squeamish, but the movie doesn't get by simply on its horror. <br /> <br />As for the ending, it's definitely interesting.  Personally, I didn't see it coming, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Overall, this is a good film, one that I'd recommend even to those who aren't always enamored of horror. <br /> <br />
B00005B36H|5.0|tool's fourth album, lateralus, could create a new significate for the word \\"perfection\\". this album contains all the instances for the perfect prog-metal album, but contains also a lot of psichedelic patterns.  <br />\\"The Grudge\\" is the first song of the album. the riff of guitar is repeated all along the eight minutes of the song, and maynard explains how the grudge could be an obstacle to throw away. the scream at the end of the song show us all the anger repressed. <br />\\"eon blue apocalypse\\" is related with \\"the patient\\". here maynard <br />explains how life can be hard to live, but everything have a significate.  <br />after \\"mantra\\", comes \\"schism\\", real poetry. maynard shows how can be difficult the life of two lovers that can't reach each other.  <br />then, here who listen to the following songs can disappear. <br />parabol/parabola is a song that talks about two persons that make love, with all their hearts. parbol is soft, lounge, and make the sensation of life, with the guitar that crawls slowly into your skin.  <br />parabola is the explosion of love, of passion. but it's not finished. <br />if parabol/parabola, is the passion, \\"ticks and leeches\\" is the rage. this songs is the sand in your mouth, the blood that you wanna suck from your enemies, the world that you wanna flush away. the guitars are evil, and the patterns of the drums are impossible. they describe the rush.  <br />then here comes the power. \\"lateralus\\", probably the best song of the album, talks about the sense of life, the way you're choosing to live, the power that surrounds you in every minute of your life. this song is mathematic: the verse is divided with the \\"fibonacci's sequence\\", and search the perfection of everything.  <br />after the final D minor of lateralus, there is one song divided in three parts: disposition, reflection and triad. these songs talks about the searching for yourself, and if you have find yourself you are at the end of the travel.  <br />faip de oiad is thefinal song of the album and shows how the governements of the world can control the human race like aliens. <br />this is simply the best album of the new century, and this travel into soul and return makes TOOL the best band of the world.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|ok, this was the first movie i've seen in a wicked long time that actually creeped me out. because it's one of those movies that could easily be real and i wont ruin it for people who havnt seen it yet but i always love movies that end like this one did they just make me feel like going out and robbing a bank hoping i get two cops like the ones in this movie to chase after me but i'd just like to say that i dont like the direction all these new horror movies are going in.it's good that they dont follow that same old formula but where the hell is the nudity. thats a very important part of a horror movie and trust me this movies had plenty of oportunities to show some.really who doesnt like the ocasional comfort of seeing a naked women amidst all the killing
B00005U2LM|1.0|Although this album has some moments, the rest of this album is so bad, this was not only wu-tang clan's worst album, it is also heading on my list of not only the worst album of the last 5 years, but also the worst albums of this decade, ODB is not even there anymore, the rapping is tired, the songs is tired, the writing is not as good as it used to, there are a few decent lyrics sometimes but that's about it.    This album is just truly awful.    However ODB R.I.P.
038551123X|5.0|Dexter Morgan is a blood spatter technician for the Miami Dade Police Department. He's handsome, polite, and a serial killer. Raised by a policeman and his family after being orphaned, Dexter kills serial killers.  When a new serial killer starts a killing spree in Miami, Dexter begins to wonder if the killer is trying to send him a message.  His sister Deborah is trying to earn a promotion to Homicide, and finding this new killer would do it.  Should Dexter try and locate this other killer himself, to express his admiration for the other's \\"art?\\" Or has Dexter finally gone completely insane and is committing these crimes himself?  Dexter's struggles with his logical personality as questions his own sanity, and attempts to maintain a normal appearance at work and with family.   I found this to be one of the best serial killer stories I've read.  I enjoyed it immensely, and wouldn't have picked it up if it hadn't come highly recommended from friends.  You start to pull for Dexter, despite his obvious predilection for murder, and I, personally, cannot wait for Lindsay's next book, Dearly Devoted Dexter, to be released July 19, 2005.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I never once doubted Mariah's skills as an artist.  Every album she comes out with continues to suprise me.  This album hasn't left my cd player in my car since I've bought it.  My favorite songs on the album are \\"we belong together\\", \\"circles\\", and \\"fly like a bird.\\".  This is the first cd I've listened to in a while that I haven't had to skip over songs because I didn't like them.  Everytime I listen to the cd I listen to it the whole ways through.  Bottom line... If you are a fan of Mariah Carey you will without a doubt love this album!
B000002MU3|5.0|I know that most people don't like this album, and I can understand why, but if you are new to the band don't be deterred from checking this out.  It is completely awesome, heavy and distorted in a controlled way, with interesting arrangements in vocal and guitars.  I think this one of the best things REM has come out with, even though I do like all of their albums and dig most of their songs.  What I really like about this album is that Stipe's singing is so unique, and mixed in with everything in a cool way.  None of their big hits are present here, for the hits you should get Automatic, Out of Time, and Document.  But here, all of the songs are just well arranged with guitar distortion and texture that has never been heard on an REM cd before or after.  real rocking out, I think! <br />I think this cd is exciting, fun and uplifting, and I think they had a lot of guts to make something that deviates so much from previous material.  Maybe its just a freak thing that I like this so much, because it doesn't rank high in most other fan lists.  However, I urge you to check it out with an open mind.  REM is a terrific band that doesn't deserve the flak they get from people who say that the majority of the band's output is mediocre.  almost everything the band makes is interesting and terrific.  I urge you to check out all of their albums, including this one (especially this one).  As always, listen before you buy.
B000001G16|5.0|Let me start off by saying that this is almost nothing like Bon Jovi. Probably most of the people who are reading are Jovi fans, but anyone who thinks that Bon Jovi is a shallow hair metal band should not let that keep them from buying this. This album is best described as blues-driven hard rock. Richie's voice at first sounds much like Jon Bon Jovi's, but that is because Richie's backing vocals are an integral part of Bon Jovi's (the band) sound. Richie also plays fantastic lead guitar and brings in Eric Clapton for a guest appearance on \\"Mr. Bluesman.\\"  The album starts off with \\"Rest in Peace,\\" which is an excellent song to begin the album. Next is the title track. This song is driven by Richie's excellent, passionate vocals and guitar solos. This song alone is worth the cost of the CD. \\"Ballad of Youth\\" and \\"Rosie\\" would have been Top 20 hits had Bon Jovi released these, but these are in no way lame pop songs. The only difference is that these are more upbeat than the others on the album. Eric Clapton guests on the decent \\"Mr. Bluesman.\\" \\"Father Time\\" is a very powerful song. Once again Richie's voice is so emotional, it is impossible not to be moved by this song. Fantastic guitar work as well.  It's interesting how Richie broke away from the constraints of being in Bon Jovi and produced one of the greatest albums ever made. By throwing away commercialism he has reached a new level that I never would have thought possible by only hearing his work with Bon Jovi. I read somewhere (I believe that it was a Rolling Stone article) that Richie wishes that he had been more commercial in his approach. Ironic, yet sad. He will never again be involved in an album like this again. His next solo album was more adult contemporary, while he hasn't done crap with Bon Jovi (Jovi has put out albums, yes, but they haven't done anything new or good in at least ten years). So definitely pick this up. At $9.98 you can't lose. This album never received the recognition that it deservedand it is a disgrace because this a strong album that did not have commercial success because the artist refused to sell out.
B000002MG1|5.0|Not everything grabs me immediately on this album; a couple songs are a little too experimental for my tastes.  I think this cd is the most beautiful thing REM has ever released, with powerful songs like \\"man on the moon\\" and \\"find the river,\\" which are just some of the best sort of folk rock songs that they are known for.  REM has always made a lot of strong music, and they had quite a few good cd's before this one, but I think that this is their most challenging, difficult, beautiful, and rewarding creation.  \\"find the river\\" is one of my all time favorite songs, and they have mostly other great songs on here like \\"ignoreland\\" and \\"monty got a raw deal.\\"   I don't like \\"Drive\\" very much, but \\"try not breathe\\" immediately redeems it.  This is such a good, classic album that you absolutely cannot overlook it.  I would suggest that you shouldn't expect the immediate appeal on this that was on Out of Time, and you'll probably have to give Automatic a few listens before you really like it.  Enjoy!
076790592X|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie tells the true story about the relationship built between an old professor and one of his former students. Morrie, the old professor, is dying from an incurable illness. He lives his life looking through a window from a chair in his study, which is also the setting of nearly the entire story. However, he does not live, what is left of his life, in self-pity. Instead, he takes this time to encourage others to live their lives to the fullest. Mitch, one of his former students, visits with Morrie as he teaches him about life's greatest lesson. Mitch had always been too afraid to express his feelings about things like love, marriage, and death, and Morrie taught him that it's ok to express those feelings. In fact, it's crucial at times. While Morrie teaches Mitch about life, they build an unbreakable relationship with one another. Throughout the story, you'll find that the ending is quite predictable, however I'll leave that as a \\"surprise ending\\" to the readers. <br /> <br />            The story has affected thousands of those who have read it. Tuesdays with Morrie teaches you that life isn't as complicated as it plays itself out to be. Handle one thing at a time and it will make everything a lot easier for you. This story really touched me and got me into thinking about things that I should value more in my life. The author of this book, Mitch Albom, is also the man who is narrating and telling his story. He shares with everyone his valuable life lesson, which was taught to him by his old college professor. This is an incredibly heart warming book that, in the end, teaches anyone who reads it, a lesson on life. Here is a book that anyone and their entire family should read, for it will inspire any and everyone who reads it. <br />
B0000669JL|5.0|A solid collection!  Just enough for the novice and still enough for the diehards!  There's a nice flow of music on this CD and before you know it, you're in deep and grooving!  But don't jus stop at \\"Legend\\" delve deeper into the musical force!  This is just the tip of the iceberg...there is so much of Bob Marely and the Wailers to discover! And I promise you won't be disappointed with what you find.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This album is full of great guitar hooks from the bass line in \\"Is this It\\" to \\"Take it or Leave it\\". I didn't like this kind of music back when it came out, so I guess you could say I am immune to the hype that everyone talks about. I can certainly understand how peoples expectations disappointed them, but this album certainly didn't disappoint me. I think that it is still the greatest album to be released this millenium. The guitar hooks are so incredibly catchy and fun...and they are in every song. Every song will stay in your head. It is impossible to skip any of these songs. I would reccomend this to everyone who likes rock.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Where \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" was innovative with fresh beats, good hooks and a passable flow, this CD is flat, fuzzy, and the rappin' is straight pre-school! I know some people are just about the beats, but the rappin' should say something too!  And 50 cents has nothing new to say!  Artists are suppose to grow from one project to the next, not regress!<br /><br />If you only want straight beats and don't care about anything else then buy this CD, but if you want mad grooves and a decent flow (I won't even say great word flow because 50 ain't no Tupac, Nas or Mos Def), then save your money 'cuz there's nothing here!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I thought this movie was absolutely charming.  It certainly make no pretenses at being anything other than it is, a charming, sometimes funny and touching way to pass a couple of hours.  It's true that about three of the plotlines could have been dispensed with completely, and it would have been a better, tighter movie.     But for me, this was made up for by absolutely superb, smart acting.  Neeson can do such amazingly delicate emotions for such a big, imposing man; Firth gives himself over deliciously to the absurdity of loving someone who can't understand his language; Thompson is heartbreaking as Rickman's wife, fearing his infidelity, yet stubbornly holding everything together; and however unlikely Hugh Grant seems as PM-- let's face it, he was a pretty unlikely book store owner, too--  he's become such a sly comic actor that it hardly matters-- he's just funny.    I don't see if anyone has mentioned the DVD extras-- the film commentary is done by Curtis, Bill Nighy, the young man who plays Neeson's stepson, and Hugh Grant-- and the highlight of that is certainly Grant's persistent ragging of Colin Firth.  Curtis eggs him on.  \\"What do you think of this actor?\\" he asks.  \\"VERY BAD,\\"  Grant intones solemnly. \\"Ohh, Gaaaawwd!\\" yawns Hugh as soon as Firth appears in another scene, \\"Now we're back to the boring bit.\\"

B000002UJQ|5.0|Transcendent, exhilarating, otherwordly, monumental and earth shatteringly emotional- to choose a few words. This is no ordinary album, the songs are so sumptuously written, so dazzling in their execution and the overall sound of the album is so breathtaking its almost as if this work has been passed down from some higher order through the earthly medium of Thom Yorke, whose voice conveys such fragility and power that somehow all the bizarre auditory fireworks set off on this record make perfect sense. Just listen to it, then listen again, and again. Don't fight it, just let the whole thing wash over you and you'll be hooked. Once you 'get' this album something clicks in your head and you never listen to anything in quite the same way again. I don't know what unearthly power Mr. Yorke has managed to tap into but thank god he has.
B0000634EV|5.0|...but their best. Down is an amazing band. NOLA is an awesome album, one of the 890's best records. But after a seven year hiatus, they release their best/strongest album. Featuring members of CoC, crowbar, Eyehategod, and, of course, Pantera, this is one of my favorite albums of all time. A favorite song here is \\"Learn from This Mistake\\", Phil's vocals are AMAZING. My favorite song on this album is the amazing \\"Ghosts Along The Mississippi\\". That song ALONE was the reason I bought this album. When I first got this album, I think I played that song on repeat for like 500000000000000000000000000 times! I just love that song! Another great song in \\"Seed\\". My second favorite song on the album is the epic \\"Landing on the Mountains of Meggido\\", which also has guest vocals from Opal Anselmo, Phil's wife (if i'm not mistaken). All the song's here kick ass, but the above mentioned songs are my definitve favorites. If you like metal, sludge metal, or just good music in general, this album is for you!<br />Ratings:<br />1.

B000002GKT|5.0|My poor and feeble written abilities can do little to add to the already prodigious acclamations described previously herein! Suffice it to say, I was there at the \\"Fillmore,\\" at the tender and impressionable age of 17, and can attest to the fact that it really did sound that good! I consider this particular recording a \\"PROMETHEAN\\" effort by an all but forgotten SUPER group!! Like fine wine or an incrdebile woman;<br /><br />this album will only get better with time, and most certainly accrue in value! Acquire it post haste and fear not, the currency spent, will most certainly not go to waste !!
0679457313|5.0|I was disappointed in what other critics had to say about Roy's novel.  In response to \\"The God of Small Things\\" being a novel and therefore about story-telling: it is not only a novel; it is a work of art.  The language, poetry.  The layers of memory that unfold the story, beauty.  True, it could be a bit confusing for some readers, but it only takes attentiveness and a passion for language to get through it.  I definitely recommend this for someone who enjoys poetry, magic, and interpretive meaning.
0393312836|5.0|this, perhaps, is the best voice in english literature.  its vernacular is truly astounding and wonderfully crafted.  never have i read a book with such pleasure.  the rhythm and pace mr. burgess developed is flawless.  the language simply glides and bounces and itties and tolchocks and... <br /> <br />i have issues with it philosophically.  and there seem to be some contradicions in ole tony's notion of freewill.  and the last chapter included in this edition (it wasn't included in the original publication in the u.s.)  is atrocious.  it is completely unwarranted  and unjustified.  it's out of the blue, it's out of left field, it's, it's...  it almost ruined the book for me.  but, ah, his language, brothers, real horrorshow indeed, lays to rest any qualms i might have had with the infamous chapter 21.  our humble narrator is our finest and never has a story been better told.  read this book!  <br />
B0002OERI0|1.0|You'd have to be an American Idiot to even purchase this album. Of course, since most of those who purchase this album are a bunch of little Middle-Schoolers, you already know that.
B000002UB3|4.0|Being one of the top-three best Beatle albums (I can never make my mind up...Rubber Soul? Revolver? Abbey Road?)this is a must-have for every rock-loving cd-buyer. It's the last outing of the greatest band of all time and the underlying emotions are showing (\\"Once there was a way to get back homeward..\\"). Things are never going to be the same and by the time the Her Majesty-ditty fades away I'm almost always dizzy by the melodies that passed by in the last 20 minutes. <br />But now on a more critical note; this could be the best-sounding Beatles-album; it's recorded on 16 and (if I'm not mistaken) 32-track machines. Instead it sounds muffled, far too little detail(a track like Here Comes the Sun deserves tingling guitar strings and a booming McCartney bass, doesn't it?), far too little bass. <br />Okay guys at EMI/Capitol/Apple; do what you did to the Beach Boys catalogue!
B00003CWN3|5.0|In case you are looking for something FUN to watch, this is not an entertaining movie. Although it's well made and educational, I don't consider this movie an entertainment movie. The story is based on a true story, and the topic is extremely heavy and serious. With that being seid, I think the film conveyed the message very well.<br /><br />No matter how sad the story is, the movie itself is well made with good acting, especially the main character who gest killed due to homophobia has done an excellent acting.<br /><br />To be honest I don't want to watch it again because of the cruelty, violence, and so much suffering, even though I know that they are part of our reality. However, I surely think it is a well done movie.
0060723513|5.0|I am shocked at the reviews others have given this book.  It is one of my favorite books and I have bought many copies as gifts for friends and family.  I read this book just as I read the Celestine Prophecy, Da Vinci Code and the left behind series.  They are great pieces of fiction, maybe with some fact thrown in (as many great stories are). <br /> <br />This book has some fabulous messages that could help us all be better people and better neighbors.
B00003CXAW|5.0|I have always loved the 1933 King Kong for its life-like special effects created by Willis O'Brien. It would be very difficult to reproduce a period piece such as this, yet that's exactly what Peter Jackson is attempting to do. I hope he succeeds, I really do, but... <br /> <br />You just can't beat the original. And it's not just the FX (spectacular for its day), but the slow build up to Kong and Kong's appearance in NYC...all just fantasic. <br /> <br />Here is some important news below! Warner and HP are digitally restoring King Kong for a new theatrical release followed by a multiple DVD release. This couldn't be better news for Kong fans! Since I'm sure Warner wishes to cash in on Peter Jackson's new magnum opus, we'll probably be seeing the DVDs at Amazon within the near future. <br /> <br /> <br />Warner Bros. Studios and HP breathe new life into classic motion pictures  <br /> <br />Warner Bros. Studios and HP also announced that they have teamed to restore the 1933 classic motion picture \\"King Kong.\\" One of the American Film Institute's 100 most beloved films and named to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, the original camera negative of \\"King Kong\\" has long been destroyed, leaving only elements and prints that have been deteriorating over the years.  <br /> <br />Warner Bros. Studios has brought the best elements and prints from all over the world and has scanned them into a 4K digital file. Using HP's \\"dirt and scratch\\" technology, which was developed by HP Labs, the 72-year-old classic will be digitally restored to its 1933 brilliance. A new camera negative as well as new archival elements will be created so that the film will be saved for generations to come. This new, restored version of \\"King Kong,\\" as it was originally released, will be screened theatrically and broadcast on television, as well as released on Warner Home Video.
0312995423|5.0|If you have ever read one of Dan Browns' books, you know how great of an author he is. Digital Fortress is just as good if not better than The Da Vinci Code and is written in the same fast-paced thrilling way. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a captivating read-it-in-one-day story. This book is one of those that has a lot of information which you need to know to understand the whole story, but I'll give you the gist of it. Digital Fortress follows Susan Fletcher, the head cryptographer of NSA (a head American government agency like the CIA or FBI). A machine they own called TRANSLTR can break any code imaginable and is only known of to a small percentage of Americans. This unbreakable code turns out to be much more than it seems. Anyone who becomes a part of it is in danger. Then, Susan realizes that she has more on the line than practically anyone else - her one and only love is in an extremely hazardous situation. This book is amazing; anyone who enjoys reading should buy this!
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is truly a spectacular movie.  Think that the greatest aspect of it was how \\"real\\" it was. The movie itself really drew you into it, making you feel like you were there. The troubles the main characters faced really make you sympathize, and therefore make you care about the outcome. I think something that contributes to this was great acting; the actors did an excellent job portraying their characters. <br /> <br />I would like to say that you have to like the general genre of the film to like the movie. It's a very impressive film that you will 'really get into'.  <br /> <br />Also, it is one of the few R-rated films that I think would be acceptable to younger audiences (there's a bit of gore, but that's about it).
B0007CNXUK|5.0|As I was reading below, I noticed a little bit of controversy regarding the true events surrounding this story, and the events that took place in the picture itself. Take note that it says \\"Inspired by True Events\\" at the start of the film as opposed to Based on a True Story, meaning that the events of the plot are only loosely connected to the actual events that happened in real life.<br /><br />Forget the true story while watching Finding Neverland, and just appreciate it for the good film that it is. It's not very often that you see a film as inspiring, imaginative, or as moving as this.
B00006JKON|5.0|When I first bought the original album of 10 songs, I only really enjoyed 4 songs, while I thought the other 6 songs were ok, but were all too happy sounding and not heavy enough. The overall album had a happy circus feeling to it and I was disappointed that it was so much weaker than Thick as a brick. But when I heard the 7 bonus tracks, I see that Tull didn't lose the plot in 1974. They were actually asked to write soundtrack songs for a comedy movie so they ended up writing commercial style songs to suit the movie. That is why the original album didnt sound true of the band; therefore, not of typical high standard. But back to the proper Tull songs, in other words the bonus tracks. Songs such as Paradise steakhouse, Saturation, Rainbow blues and Sealion 2 bring out the great heavy Tull I knew before 1974 and then there is Glory row, Quartet and Warchild waltz which sound like the next batch of nice acoustic Tull. Tull should have originally released all 7 bonus tracks on the original album in 1974 along with Queen and country, Skating away, Warchild and Only solitaire. That would have made a classic album. Anyway, I was suprised not to hear March the mad scientist and the much improved remixed version of Bungle in the jungle on the remaster.
B000063DFQ|4.0|Many people think PIECE OF MIND is Iron Maiden's best album.  In my humble opinion, what fools them into thinking that is the album's production.  Martin Birch did a masterful job of recording PIECE OF MIND.  It's one of the best sounding heavy metal albums of all time.  The guitar sound is amazing.  This is a very good album, but not Maiden's best.  Why?  The band doesn't perform with the same fire they had on PIECE's predecessor, THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST.  In other words, most of the songs are good, but the execution is lacking a bit.  These songs came across with a lot more energy when Maiden performed them live on the '83 WORLD PIECE TOUR.  If you can get a bootleg copy of the band's show at London's Hammersmith Odeon in May of that year, you'll hear what I mean.     PIECE OF MIND opens strongly with \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", one of the best songs Maiden has ever written.  It's very intense & has some great rhythm guitar work. Next up is \\"Revelations\\", which is a pretty good song.  Performance-wise, it just plods along a bit.  Written by singer Bruce Dickinson, the song has a Jethro Tull-ish type of feel to it.  The next song is \\"Flight Of Icarus\\".  Again, it's a good song, but the band didn't put the energy into the performance that they should have.  The guitar solos are very good though.  \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" is kind of a different song for Maiden.  Instead of playing riffs in the main verse sections, guitarists Dave Murray & Adrian Smith are playing sustained chords.    \\"The Trooper\\" is one of Maiden's best known songs.  Murray & Smith's guitar intro sounds like Thin Lizzy on steroids.  Lyrically, the song deals with the Crimean War.  It has that trademark galloping guitar riff.  Again, as great as the song is, Maiden played it better live.  \\"Still Life\\" is unique in that it was co-written by Dave Murray.  Why he hasn't been more of a songwriting force is a mystery, because he is a very good guitarist.  Anyway, \\"Still Life\\" opens with a backwards message.  It's nothing satanic.  Drummer Nicko McBrain is just saying some nonsensical stuff.  Then Murray comes in with a melodic and beautiful guitar piece.  Dickinson then sings a few lines over a melodic rhythm guitar part.  The song then start rocking pretty hard.  Dave Murray plays a wild guitar solo towards the end of the song.  A very good track indeed.  Next is the album's only abortion \\"Quest For Fire\\".  Lyrically, I believe the song was based on the movie of the same name.  Bruce Dickinson's vocals are lame and the guitar riff just sort of plods along.  Definitely a song to skip.  \\"Sun And Steel\\" is pretty good song.  I love the main guitar riff.  My only complaint would be that the chorus section is repeated a few times too many.  The album closes with \\"To Tame A Land\\", which is based on Frank Herbert's book, \\"Dune\\".  The band throws a little bit of everything into this song: melodic guitar passages, time changes, hard-rocking riffs, and over-the-top guitar solos.  I think it's one of the best songs they've ever done.    On the band's previous three albums, Steve Harris wrote 85 - 90% of the material.  On PIECE OF MIND, Bruce Dickinson, Dave Murray, and Adrian Smith made major songwriting contributions.  This added some variety to the material.  I just wish the members of the band had more fire in their bellies when they recorded PIECE OF MIND.
0609610570|1.0|While reading \\"Execution The Discipline of Getting Things Done,\\" I kept waiting for the big insight - it never came. The book is written for higher level executives. But, if you have made it to that level, you probably don't need this book. The book could have been shorter, with the basic advice distilled rather than reiterated. I wanted some ways to lead a productive team and concrete ways to get things done. The \\"Letter to a New Leader\\" was the best part of the book. There are no references, which makes me think the authors did no research, or they feel their ideas are the only ideas. I think this lack of scholorship is one of the reasons the authors' content is so thin. I walked away hungry for more information and keener observations about execution. I had nothing to take back to the office with me after reading this book.
0670033375|5.0|This fascinating book is an excellent follow up to Guns, Germs, and Steel.  Through combining history with examination of current events it examines the important role of the environment on society.  Yet the author does so without supporting environmental determinism.  It raises interesting questions about the sustainability of various ways of living.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|I loved this movie for many reasons. All of which I wont list becasue it's pointless, eveyone must decide for themselves what they get out of this movie. But I must comment on the the murder scene. It by far is the scene that resonates with me most. I literally began to cry during the scene at the sheer sickness of humanity...flinching with every blow...the psychological build up of the rat screaming.... the plunging of the drano filled rig...it all was so crazy and disturbing I just felt for a moment like James St. James when he begs for the rat to STOP!!! I just didn't want to see any more of it, yet I couldn't look away.
0385513755|5.0|If you have yet to read the Da Vinci Code, buy this book and read it. While there are not a great many, those visual aids -- schematics, photos, maps -- that are included are extremely helpful. Some of the photographs are breathtaking.<br /><br />This book is exactly as it's cracked up to be. It is extraordinarily well conceived and superbly written. One has to admire an author who can write minute detail without it being perceived as filler. Every detail presented in The Da Vinci Code is pertinent. It is also much to the author's credit to be able to keep so much detail straight and to present it in such a way as to keep the reader interested. The plot is constructed so expertly that it all seems quite plausible (hence the controversy). Intrigue abounds. The characters are believable and well-constructed. As I often do with a book as jam-packed with information as this one, I set it down periodically to give myself time to absorb what I'm reading. It may be only a few minutes, or an hour, and, occasionally, a day. The short chapters make setting it down and picking it up again very easy to do.<br /><br />This book is a novel (again, that's fiction, folks) about the closeness of Mary Magdelene to Jesus and how the \\"true\\" knowledge of their relationship might affect Christian religion and practice as we know them today. Certainly the emergence of the power of the sacred feminine would cause problems for those who see Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism and Islam as, primarily (and in some cases totally), the realm of men. For me, the most important phrase in the whole book, considering the topic, was young Sophie's answer to her grandfather's query about the possibility that Jesus had a girlfriend. Her innocent and unbiased child's answer was, \\"I wouldn't mind.\\" Out of the mouths of babes....<br /><br />I would recommend that all those with any awareness of the spiritual and organized religion aspect of mankind read this book and then talk about it with others. If I could give it more than five stars, I would. The Da Vinci Code is a fascinating and exciting read.<br /><br />For those interested in a NOVEL about the papacy and the election of a new Pope, I recommend the book and the movie The Shoes of the Fisherman by Morris West.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hille stars, I would. The Da Vinci Code is a fascinating and exciting read.

B00005YXZH|5.0|This is Wilco at their best. The combination of brilliant melodies, clever lyrics, and off-the-wall ambient noise make this something NEW. Something we haven't REALLY heard before.<br /><br />A great example is my favorite Wilco track: \\"Ashes of American Flags.\\" It has a simple melody and chord structure, but the sharp lyrics and wild sounds come together for something really interesting, really moving.<br />I love this line from the song:<br /><br />\\"I want a good life, with a nose for things,<br />Fresh wind and bright sky, to enjoy my suffering.\\"<br /><br />Perfectly sums up the bittersweet feeling of frontman Jeff Tweedy's lyrics.<br /><br />There are some really solid singles here too. \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" and \\"Jesus Etc.\\" got some heavy radio play. However, the rest of the album takes some time to get to know. Give it time, you'll be glad you did. This album came out a few years ago now, and it still sounds fresh to me.<br /><br />If you like this album, order \\"Being There\\" and \\"Summerteeth.\\" I would only recommend their latest album, \\"A Ghost is Born\\" for super-fans of Wilco. It has some fantastic tracks, but it is a big departure from YHF and the albums mentioned above.<br /><br />Check out the documentary film about the making of YHF, \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.\\" You see relationships fall apart (band members, record companies) and the final victory that Wilco had with this album. A great film.<br /><br />You should own this album! (Don't just get a CD burned from one of your buddies!)
B000268QB2|5.0|This CD is absolutely wonderful!!. <br />It's suitbale for every mood...I just can't get enough of it. <br /> <br /> Warmly recommended!!!! <br />
B00000I41G|4.0|Burrell (g) Stanley Turrentine (ts) Major Holley (b) Bill<br /><br />  English (d) Ray Barretto (cga) 1/7/63.<br /><br />Probably Burrell's best-loved album, though I don't think it's his absolute best. KENNY'S SOUND and K TWIST, which are bonus tracks, are very good. Five of the nine tracks are blues, and Burrell is a master of the blues. Turrentine takes a decidedly subordinate role, hardly playing on some tunes, not playing at all on others; when he does blow his whispy tenor sound is effective. A couple of tunes, MULE and SOUL LAMENT, are below average, thus the 4 stars. Every Burrell fan has this CD, and it's a good one, but don't pass up some of his OJC/Prestige releases.
0393317552|3.0|It's a very good book; and I think that it adds a piece to the puzzle as to why European culture dominated for hundreds of years. Diamond's flaw is that he neglects a few major events that occured which also pushed Europe along this path: <br /> <br />-The Islamic world's regression into religious extremism after the Crusades caused it to lose ground technologically. <br /> <br />-The Renaissance in Europe (which also was a direct result of the Crusades) helped increase trade in Europe which caused it to gain ground technologically <br /> <br />-The fact that China made a conscience decision to withdraw into isolation caused it to lose ground technologically <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I think that Guns, Germs, & Steel is a great book in two regards: It shows that geography played a larger part in shaping history that most of us thought; and I think it does a very good job in demonstrating that all races are equally intelligent. <br /> <br />That said, his attempt to broadly explain the entire course of history is a little short-sighted. <br />
B000089RV6|5.0|What else can you say about this album.this is an essential recording for any rock & roll fan.AC/DC kicks ass through out this whole album.Most songs on this album are concert staple.This album starts up with the classic HELLS BELLS the ominous tolls wich was copied later on by metallica its a bit spooky with its evilish lyrics \\"SATAN GET YOU,SATAN GET YOU HELLS BELLS\\"  .Fallowed by SHOOT TO THRILL wich is another classic on this cd the opening riff is amazing with the little good,the bad,and the ugly riffs in the middle.After that its the gold diggers anthem WHAT DO YOU FOR MONEY HONEY fallowed by GIVEN THE DOG A BONE wich is a bit tounge and cheek if you listen to the lyrics \\"SHES GOIN DOWN TO THE DEVIL DOWN 90 DEGREES\\" as in on her knees (BJ).fallowed by another double meaning song LET ME PUT MY LOVE INTO YOU.and then ofcourse the title track what can be said about this masterpice every one knows that riff E,DDD,AAA when i was little i would here it and say that rocks this along with HIGHWAY TO HELL got me into AC/DC.AND ofcourse the concert staple YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG probablly AC/DC most known song.The next two song are underated on this album HAVE A DRINK ON ME is an awsome track along with SHAKE A LEG.and then the closing statement ROCK & ROLL AINT NOISE POLLUTION this is an Fu to any one you thinks rock is going anywhere it makes you \\"THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE FORGET ABOUT THE PAST\\" because \\"ROCK & ROLL AINT NOISE POLLUTION,ROCK & ROLL AINT GONNA DIE,ROCK & ROLL IT WILL SURVIVE\\" <br />and with AC/DC at the head of this promise you know it wont.everyone knows some one that owns BACK IN BLACK if they dont own it themselfs and going DOUBLE DIMOND AINT THAT BAD FOR A 20+ YEAR OLD ALBUM. <br />AC/DC BEST BAND EVER BON SCOTT OR BRIAN JOHNSON THEY KICK a$$.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie means something special to me.  It first kicked off my anime mania when I saw it released in theators back in middle school.  Upon buying it 2 years ago, I continue to watch it every now and then and each time is special and I learn something each time.  I have also watched this with my family and friends who enjoyed this film, despite it being anime, alot.<br /><br />As well, the soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous much like Miyazaki's lush enviroments, storytelling, and characters.<br /><br />A masterpiece.
0679745203|3.0|Michael Ondaatje's \\"The English Patient,\\" deals with four individuals who lived together in an Italian villa which used to be a hospital during World War II. There was the mysterious \\"English patient,\\" who suffered tremendous burnt to a point that he was almost completely black who no one seemed to know what his name was or who he was and there was Hana, a nurse who took it upon herself to nurse and care for him.  <br />In addition, there was Caravaggio who was a thief, spy, and a friend of Hana's father who stayed at the villa because of her. Lastly, there was Kip, a Sikh who was a sapper with the British forces and who fell in love with Hana. All four had baggage/burden of their own and this book deals with how lives intersected with one another. This setting of this book was of course the World War II. <br /> <br />This is not one of the easiest books to read as the author goes back and forth with each of the individual's stories and as Newsday wrote, it has \\"many-layered mysteries.\\" At the beginning of the book, we don't really know much of the individuals but the author gradually released bits and pieces of their information. The style of the author was very poetic and lyrical and at times this posed a difficulty for me to fully comprehend the book. The pace of the book was a bit slow for my liking. I like the idea behind the book but I didn't really appreciate his style of writing.  <br />
B0007KTBIU|5.0|What's all the fuss about?  I was around 10 yrs old when I first whatched this movie and I thought and still think it's great. The animation was well drawn, especially the \\"colors of the wind\\" part. The musics were very strong (don't miss out near the end music, it really rises your spirit). And 1 or 2 songs of Disney's Pocahontas were really meaningfull. Overall it deserves a good rating. <br /> <br />But why all the complaints? <br />People that gave bad ratings mostly complained about the inaccuracy of the movie portraying the history. Even History itself is not true. History is just a recording made by us, even they who wrote it can alter it. For instance, our American History wrote about Columbus being the first to discover America; in fact he is the last, actually never did reached America. People who complained are scared that their children will get the wrong ideas of history. I first watched it before I learned the \\"Truth\\" as well, and now I'm 20 and well aware of the true history of Pocahontas, and no I'm not affected by Disney's version. I can manage to seperate history from fantasy. <br /> <br />And I realized how many complained about racial issue; Caucasians complained about the appearence of white people and that they are the \\"badguys\\" in the movie. Native Americans complained that the movie protrayed them as savages. In this movie I only saw 1 villian and of course it's Ratcliff. Now the movie titled Pocahontas, you can assume it's about the Native Americans. And that's why the movie focus the character appearence more on Native Americans than on Caucasians. As for most of Disney's movie; the main focused characters will always appear more pleasent than the sides or the villians. I bet no one will complain about racial issue if both versus are the same race. I also don't see any savageness portrayed in the movie both Caucasians and Native Americans. If you think about it, Ratcliff promised gold in the new land. Who wouldn't turn greedy hearing aboutit, espeacially being a peasant back in England. Therefore it's reasonable why the Native Americans felt threaten and set up a defense (You would be if someone you don't know move in with you, and not knowing their purpose). And so war came about b/c both don't understand each other's purpose in the land; where one wants gold and the other won't share land. When both don't understand each other they both consider each other savages. <br /> <br />To end myself, you would enjoyed it greatly if you set history and racial issues aside. Don't just consider your point of view but open yourself up. This movie actually brings meaning than controversy...
B00001NFCY|4.0|Human Clay was the first CD I purchased in a long line of future purchases to outgrow my shelf. For this Human Clay is very special to me and holds sentimental value. As for the songs themselves, they're very uplifting and provide insight into revenge, immortality, betrayal, abuse, the arrival of new life, and going on amidst chaos and diversity. Although I occasionally forget this album for a few months at a time, I always come back to it to absorb its wisdom and wicked riffs. This is a good album to start with or add to your collection.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is the best hard rock cd ever! My favorites off this album<BR>are Welcome to the Jungle, Nightrain, Mr. Brownstone, Paradise<BR>City, Sweet Child O' Mine, &amp; Rocket Queen. Other than that I like<BR>It's so Easy. The weakest songs off this album I think are My<BR>Michelle, You're Crazy, &amp; Anything Goes. Those are the songs I<BR>don't really like. So why don't you go out and buy this CD today<BR>and I will save you some money for the next CD you buy. Anyway<BR>it is a great CD.
B000062YAZ|5.0|If someone were to take a tour of Hell by riding a super-fast rollercoaster and there was music playing, this CD would be it. After listening to this record from beginning to end for the first time, my exact thought was \\"Woah, what the hell was that?\\" This album is so fast, and so brutal it's not even funny. This monster of an album makes \\"Master of Puppets\\" sound like a Josh Groban CD. From the opening scream of \\"Angel of Death\\", to the sound of thunder at the end of \\"Raining Blood\\", this album is the true meaning of \\"extreme.\\"
B00000J1YS|4.0|I have not tried all these songs yet but maybe in the feature.<BR>The only song I have ever liked off this CD was Telegraph Road<BR>because it was 14 minutes and it had a true story about a long<BR>time ago came a man on a track walking thirtie miles with a sack<BR>on his back. Other than that, in my opinion Private Investigations is the weakest song off this cd. So if you got<BR>a plan to buy this CD, go buy it now.
0596009208|3.0|I have bought and read through the first edition of this book. Yes, it acts like a comic book and offers lively explanations to some Java concepts. But I think it is only suitable for Java beginners. <br /> <br />There are many important concepts that are not mentioned in this book, like for example, Inner classes, the use of wait() and notify() methods, etc. If you are studying for the Sun Java exam, do not soley depend on this book. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, this book is really good for beginners since I mentioned the fundamental concepts very well. I have not read the second edition, but it just includes the new features of J2SE 1.5 release.

B000002U82|2.0|Wow, the most fascinating thing about this album is the reviews it has garnered from \\"the kid\\".  I'm assuming it's all the same person who has so obviously had such a visceral reaction to this album.  Kudos to Pink Floyd for creating \\"art\\" that has motivated people to react in such a way.  Personally, I think the Pink lost it after Syd.  One star for \\"Money\\" (great record) and one more because it isn't The Wall.

Que Craso Error El Mio... <br />  A decir verdad este disco bien podria ser colocado entre los mejores de esta banda, siendo un disco muy variado hay rolas para complacer a todo mundo!! Por ejemplo Judas Rising, Demonizer o Hellrider son al puro estilo Painkiller, Deal With The Devil con unos \\"riffs\\" de guitarra que te haran cabecear aunque no quieras!! Angel, cancin lenta que te da un respiro relajado... y hasta la pica Lochness como gran cierre. <br />  Realmente estamos ante un gran disco del genero metal, con los ingredientes clasicos de Judas (el ataque de las \\"twin guitars\\" de KK y Timpton, y la voz de Halford en una excelente forma) que no tiene nada que envidiarle a los otros discos ya clsicos de esta banda. Si le agregas el hecho de que trae un DVD con un reportaje a cerca de la reunion de la banda y 7 clsicos del grupo (Breaking The Law, Diamonds And Rust, Hellion/Electric Eye, Touch Of Evil, Metal Gods, Hell Bent For Leather y Living After Midnight) tocados en vivo durante el Tour de reunin del ao pasado, te aseguro que tendras un excelente material para disfrutarlo por mucho tiempo...
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Recently Michael Jackson's child molestation trial has caused a media frenzy keeping him in the public's eye which is why I've chosen to review his music. if you have not expierenced Michael jackson you need \\"The Ultimate Collection!\\" Michael jackson is a living musical legend who has sold more records than any other artist in history. <br />What sets this compilation apart are the hard to find cuts such as \\"someone in the Dark\\" ans \\"scared of the Moon' from the E.T storybook. the Ultimate collection consists of both CDs and live video performances by the artist;although all of his greatest hits and number ones aren't in this collection the value still stands unmatched. We all ahve our favorites from Michael's many hits but I am confident that there are a generous amount of your favorite tracks in this collection. <br />this collection covers music's different eras:from michael's childhood stardom,to his bubble gum days all the way up to the compassionate rebel without a cause movement. You can hear it in his voice and see it in his performance his transitioning from a boy to a man and Michael never looses his edge. the world was changing during those times and Michael's music didn't miss a beat. He never lost his rythmic,soulful, and rock hard messages of hope and restoration. The Ultimate Collection has seventy-three tracks such as \\"We are the World\\",\\"Thriller\\",and even earliers tracks like \\"ABC\\".it's not often an artist of such high esteem compiles his hits into a box set,considering how many many hits there has been to choose from,this is truly a phenomnon. <br />this anthology will definetly levae a lasting impression on you. the songs not only showcase Michael's unique talent but it also allows you to see how he has perfected his craft over time growing as both an artist and an entertainer. I give The Ultimate collection five stars. some might view this collection as incomplete and unworthy of five stars but i say the mark of a true performer is to always keepthem wanting more. So go out and buy this piece of history and expierence Michael as the singer,songwriter, and entertainer we have all grown to love. i sa\\"why buy an album when you can have The Ultimate Collection.\\" <br />

0440238609|4.0|I actually read this trilogy THE same semester I took a course Milton.  An acquaintance made the recommendation in a completely unrelated encounter.  I even assumed the title and opening quotes were a matter of pretense or homage or something silly.  Well, how wrong I was!  Such a scatterbrain, I!  There is method in Pullman's... okay, wrong bard. <br /> <br />Any rate... <br /> <br />Quite a bit going on here.  I have some issues (naphtha? give me a break Pullman, could you USE a more Edenic word for \\"oil\\"? pearls before swine...) but on the whole a captivating read.  If you happen to be an easily-scandalized, fundamentalist Christian, DON'T BOTHER, as you'll wet yourself reading and then tell your pastor about it.  Milton, as Puritanical as he was, would be sick with your lot (yeah, read \\"Areopagitica\\" and tell ME about censorship).  Otherwise, whatever age you might be, you'll come away with more than you left with... <br /> <br />...Like thinking Lyra every time you read of \\"immortal Eve.\\"
0061015725|2.0|While the technical plot and science were interesting, the lack of any real human emotion among the characters was something I found to be disconcerting.  Without giving away much of the plot, I found a lack of realism in the effects that friends' and long-time colleagues' misfortunes had upon the hero, Jack, as well as upon each other, not to mention the lack of emotion about what was occuring to spouses and children. <br /> <br />This, to me, was such a major shortcoming that it made the whole experience unbelievable and unsatisfying for me as a reader.
B0001I551K|2.0|Space Battleship Yamato is one of the seminal anime films -- arguably, without the Yamato juggernaut launched by the movie (remember, the TV show did poorly, and it was only with the compilation, that Yamato fandom really began to take off), Gundam, Macross, Urusei Yatsura and all of the other greats of anime may not have been made. <br />The film is OK, good but not great. As a two-hour movie spliced together from 48 or so half-hours of TV, it has a very rushed feel to it, and you don't get a sense of the crew as a unit. It'd probably help viewers to see the Space Battleship Yamato TV series (or failing that, Star Blazers) to get a firm grip on each character and their relationships with one another and the plot as a whole. That being said, the film does hit the highlights (including the spectacular battle in the Seven Color Nebula) and still manages to give a sense of epic, grand adventure. <br />Where the disc takes a nose-dive is, well, the disc itself. Mine will not play on any of my DVD players -- and I exchanged the disc at least three times (once through Voyager themselves, and a couple of times at Suncoast). On one player, it plays fine until the layer change, and then the picture breaks up dramatically. On all my other players, the disc won't read at all. I am not buying another Voyager disc after this, since the encoding was so shoddy.
078062999X|1.0|I must say I am surprised by the number of people who actually like this turgid four hour ego-fest by Branagh.  It is simply unwatchable for long stretches, thanks mostly to Branagh's scene chewing.  To watch a real version of \\"Hamlet\\" on film, see Nicol Williamson's \\"Hamlet.\\"  Branagh is the problem here - his take on the character comes off as being both bellicose and superficial, no small achievment.  Like a lot of directors, he becomes infatuated with seeing now many trick shots and unusual editing choices he can throw at the viewer, with the end result being that this is a really poorly made movie.  Good performances by Jacobi, Christie and Winslet are wasted, and poor performances by Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon are, well, really poor performances.  Branagh just migh be one of the most over-rated directors and performers in the last few decades, and this film shows us why.  He really has nothing to say about the character or the play that hasn't been said before, and more intelligently or more artistically before.  A pretty, but vacuous and inept movie and interminable film. Can't wait to see what he does to \\"King Lear\\" one day.  I'm kidding - I'll wait and pray he doesn't try to eclipse the wonderful Scofield/Brook Lear of the early sixties.

No matter what, I think it'll make a good screenplay for a film.<br /><br />In any event, give it a chance if you even THINK you might like a 'techno' thriller with plot elements such as high-tech computers, government bureaucrats, the NSA (National Security Agency), detailed descriptions of far-off-and-exotic lands, and a wee bit of a love story thrown in.<br /><br />No matter what, even if you DON'T like it, you will not be investing too much time in reading it!
B00005IC2H|5.0|This is some other-worldly music that can hit you just right depending on what mood you are in.  Sigur Ros will likely make you feel depressed and sick if you are in a great mood, and can make you waste your entire day being all melancholic.  There are times when I think Sigur Ros is garbage and pointless.  Every once in a while, however, I think everyone's soul needs this kind of melodic thereapy.  99 percent of people I know need to just F'n chill out and escape the rat race that becomes their daily life.  Nothing will do it like Sigur Ros.  this music is not for just listening to whenever.  Enjoy it very sporadically, but intensely.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave is made up of members from two of the 90s biggest bands: hard-rockers Rage Against The Machine and grunge idols Soundgarden. With this, Audioslave's slef-titled debut album, the band attempts to combine the sounds of its members' former groups to make something new, and the result is fantastic. <br /> <br />The disc kicks off with a few hard-rock tracks: the singles \\"Cochise\\" and \\"Show Me How To Live\\". Later on, songs such as \\"Like A Stone\\", \\"I Am The Highway\\", and \\"Getaway Car\\" put more emphasis on vocals and lyrical content than on the guitars. <br /> <br />Overall, the CD flows well, switching back and forth between low-key and uptempo numbers. The lyrics are well-written and the instrumentals are superb, and it's obvious that the band has brilliant creative chemistry. <br /> <br />At certain points, comparisons to Rage and Soundgarden are inevitable--Tom Morello's guitar playing and Chris Cornell's vocals are much too unique to avoid it. Luckily, the band blends the two sounds, so this CD doesn't sound like a rehash of the older bands' works. All in all this is a great debut album.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|People say they have been enigma fan since their debut in 1990. <br />but hey! I have been Michael Cretu's fan since 1986. I loved his album \\"Belle Epoch\\". It was a blast, still is a blast from the past. I have loved every single Enigma album until this one. It just does not have the true Enigma touch. Even the recording quality was not good, or maybe it was just my CD. Still Enigma is the real thing and much better than \\"nigma wannabes\\"! I am waiting for their next album which hopefully would be a better one. I still love you Enigma !
B000089RV6|2.0|I bought this CD when I started getting into AC/DC. I liked it at first, but it took me less than a week to realize, that AC/DC are really not something good, special. <br /> <br />Every song has the same sound and structure - a guitar riff in the intro, that builds up to the verse, and that a catchy chorus. In the chorus, the whole band members shout the song's name, with miniature changes. After the second chorus there's a guitar solo by Agnus Young, and again, not anything special. <br /> <br />From some downloaded songs, I can say that Bon Scott's AC/DC were practically the same. <br /> <br />Don's get me wrong - this CD has his moments. the doomy church bells in the intro of \\"Hell's Bells\\", that builds up to a great rocker; the cool raping in \\"Back in Black\\"; the two last instrumental minutes in \\"Shoot to Thrill\\", where Phil Rudd really smacks the drums. But, it's not THAT good. AC/DC don't make anything new. Just the same sound, in each and every song. <br /> <br />This CD is now lying in the bottom of my CDs pile, gathering dust.  <br />And yet, I'm not disappointed with this purchase. AC/DC WAS one of more... *important* bands in the 70's, and in the Metal area. This way I know that I've heard them, and I can say that I wasn't missing anything if I didn't hear them. <br />
B00079018K|3.0|love the album, hate the copy protection. cant even play the last 3 songs on my diskman. <br /> <br />if you can manage to find their contact info, call or email bmg to complain about this horrible new trend.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This album is where a mellow pop teenager turns into a dark almost gothic rocker. Perfectly layered and blende tracks that will remain the bulk of her repetoire for the next century. From the upbeat and uplifting \\"Complicated\\" two years ago she turns into a darker more appealing musician. \\"Together\\" is a contrast that blitzes any song at the moment. She has had 2 years to mature get out of school and make good music. Heck this record is addictive. We saw \\"Skater Boi\\" blitz the charts, \\"Don't Tell Me\\" is following in its footsteps. Every song strangely has a lyrical morale but I like that in music. Without the Matrix she has made a modern musical classic.
B0007GAERG|1.0|When it comes to music, people always refer things such as this or that, but does anyone really know how music is emancipated? This album isn't emancipation at all. The tracks \\"I Like That\\" and \\"We Belong Together\\" are some tracks I rate 2.5 stars. The others are 0 stars. This album is just for publicity stunt, just for Mariah not to let her fans keep left-checked.
B00064MW6A|1.0|I did not rent 'Catwoman' expecting it to be your traditional Gotham-type action thriller. Instead, I was looking for it to be a psychological drama thriller featuring Halle Berry as Patience Phillips. I was really looking forward to her showing the psychological pain of Patience, and then evolve into the character of Catwoman. The problem with this film is there is really no good nor evil. And no script!  <br /> <br />One good thing I will say is that on the dvd there is a history of 'Catwoman' in the features played over the years which is fascinating with the likes of Eartha Kitt and others including Halle making you feel like you at least spent money on something worthwhile.
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|First off, i'de like to reccomend anyone reading these to skip every comment saying \\"Nick and Dave Grohl are missing!!, OMG it's over for QOTSA!!!!\\", because these people have no idea what they are talking about, and are the tipical kiddies that heard \\"No One Knows\\" on MTV and suddenly think they're QOTSA fans.  <br /> <br />The new album is great, Grohl's absence made absolutely no difference and IMO Castillo is better. As for Olivieri, when you honestly look back at all of QOTSA's songs, Josh's are BY FAR superior to Nick's. The new album went in a different direction than SFTD, which is cool and proves that they know how to make things fresh and not repetitive like all the other wanna-be pop-rock trash these days. Songs like Insane, Plaid, Wolf, Burn the Witch, and Blood is Love are all incredible and some of the best work QOTSA have ever done. <br /> <br />I saw these guys live at Webster Hall, NYC in March and I must say they were incredible, so much energy. See them live if you can.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Really no words to describe what you feel when you listen to songs like paranoid android, which after taking you on a rollarcoaster of  emotions. Then, without a break it leads you into subterranean homesick alien, a sharp,hair raising fantasy. THIS ALBUM IS CLOSEST THE TO PERFECT YOU CAN GET.
B000060P79|1.0|Hi I hate simple plan, their music has no depth, it's just \\"Come on kids listen to our really bad music\\". One of my closest friends like them and that sucks. Everytime my brother puts on their sophomore album, I tell him to turn it off.
B0007GAERG|1.0|It amazed me when I heard that this CD debuted at #1 on Billboard.  They must be doing the same thing they did several years ago -- priced the record extremely low and have people from the record company go out and buy copies to give the impression that its big.  Mariah has a great voice, but she needs to stick with her early 90's formula -- pop/R&B.  She sounds foolish trying to be hip-hop.  She's a product and the record industry will keep shoving her down our throats ... and most will eat it up, unfortunately.
B0007O38F8|5.0|FINALLY, an album that will appeal to both pimps and hoes alike! 50 has once again delivered a remarkable and breathtaking work, one that will no doubt make him new fans while not alienating the hardcore thugs and bitches. CENT continues his quest for ultimate coolness on this slammin' cd, his street-cred tongue laying down seductive tales of crack-head gangstas and payback drive-bys.  Simply put, this disc has something for everyone, and with Mother's Day just around the corner, it makes a great gift -- all the mamas love this homeboy.
B00004Z459|1.0|The top thing that annoys me about this band is when someone classifies them as metal.  They aren't, and why they got that spot in Ozzfest one year is a mystery to me.  Oh, wait, it was probably money.  This CD is agonizing; I bought it a LONG time ago when I was really diving into the realm of music.  And when you do that, you're bound to make a few mistakes, this was one of them.  Pop crap on a plate.  A lot of people don't know that when they became a band, Chester was chucked in by the record company, he wasn't part of the band, they were manufactured by the record company.  That's not a real band.  The lyrics do not have any swears in them, thus supporting the idea of being a tool for the record companies and attempting to get as much singles as possible.  They also didn't; have a bass player at the time, and speaking of which, the bass is barely here at all.  I was brought in because I liked the song One Step Closer, but I swear that if I hear In the End, or its crappy remixes, one more time, I'm going to snap.  There is nothing here but clich teenage angst.  A few friends of mine don't agree with me one this, but they are willing to admit that Linkin Park is or was a guilty pleasure.      They manage to pull of the raping thing her to some degree, but by the time they came out Nu-metal or rap/rock was basically dead.  This band will never be able to live up to this Hybrid theory record.  No band that has releases its first album and become a smash hit right away can live up to it or survive.  Look at their new albums for proof.  Heck Metallica needed to get to Master of Puppets (their third album) before anyone took notice of them, and then they too, went into a downward spiral and sold out excessively.  Don't look to Linkin Park for a good band; you're just up for a disappointment.
B000002UJQ|2.0|This music just meanders all over the place, I want something that will suprise me but this is all the same slow boring stuff. Filter Happier is the best track and makes up two stars, please don't buy this.
B000244FDW|1.0|I had to write a book report on P&P. Since I'm lazy, I thought watching the movie would made my work easier. Wow, did I learn my lesson! This is the most boring movie I have ever seen and surprisingly made by BBC which I always think it's the best in making period movies.  <br /> <br />Who are those actors? Most of them, especially young ones, seems like have no acting training at all. They all say their line in a fast, monotone voice. And what's with this Darcy guy? Even when he is speaking, not an inch of his face moves. And did he have neck injury? When he turns his head, he always turns his whole upper body. <br /> <br />Besides the aweful acting, the directing, editing and everything else are no good either. In the end, it's a total waste of 4 hours and totally put me off the idea of reading the book and writing the report. I did on Oliver Twist instead.
B00000634J|5.0|If everyone in the world listened to the song Imagine every day, then there would be peace on earth! <br /> <br />\\"If everyone demanded peace instead of another television set, then there'd be peace.\\" - John Lennon
B00006JDU9|2.0|I loved the three original star wars, but Lucas should have just stopped there. This movie quite plainly is a pure waste of time and energy. There's no acting in the movie, its called reading script and waiting for cue. (SIGH) what people call movies these days is quite depressing.<br /><br />The movie starts out just like every other one starts out, with the ship floating through space. Come one Lucas! Think of something completely new! We would thank you for it. Then for them on the movie rapidly progresses on a downward slump of bad movie making. Ben Kenobie is frankly a disapointment, he's a silent rather punkish hunk that can't act worth his life. And his Jedi Master is even worse. I have no clue on how his name is spelled, so I'm not even going to try, all I know that it just wasn't star warish. More kiddish than anything.<br /><br />Then the aliens get rather dumb, whats with the stupid long-eared one that can't speak, and lives in a city that is supposed to be hidden, but anyone with half a clue where it could be. Would be able to find in the space of five minutes. So much for hidden.<br /><br />On the whole, the movie thing left me irritated and angry at Lucas, the whole star wars feeling was gone, and instead there was the uncanny feeling that it was nothing more than a circus in space.
1577311523|5.0|This book is one of the few that really helped me in my life. The author has an incredible ability of sharing information that made a significant difference in my life. The information showed me where I was going wrong in my life, and I now understand a lot more!  <br /> <br />I'll call this \\"the must have now book\\"!
B00005OAIE|4.0|I have to agree with most of the people who are speaking highly of this album. Being 40, I remember what he's talking about, and it pulls at my emotions a bit. And guess what, I'm not a woman. <br />It sort of makes me have some feelings of nostalgia, and regret. I want to sort out some issues that happened in my 20s, but I can't....and that bothers me.  <br /> <br />In other words, this album touches me, and I think if you have an ounce of sensitivity, it will you as well.  <br />
B0006A9FMI|2.0|Unless you don't mind your movies in Japanese, wait for the special edition.  The only way to get English is through the subtitles.  Unfortunate and somewhat mystifying considering both versions of the first film had an English dub.   <br /> <br />Hopefully this won't damage sales so much that the publishers see this as lack of interest and decide not to release a special edition, or at least a decent one.  For other problems & valid complaints, read the other reviews here.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Mystic River was the first movie that I have ever watched that was directed from Clint Eastwood, and I am happy to say that it was worth the time.<br /><br />Mystic River is very sad, and rather depressing. If you've ever watched the Sleepers, then you'll understand when I say that Mystic River was exactly like that one. Except this time Kevin Bacon was on the right side of the law.<br /><br />The ending did nothing in making the film lighter or more joyous, instead, it left me even more sad than when the movie began. Not the best way in ending a movie, but thats life I guess, not everything is going to turn out for the better. Still, I couldn't help but wonder if things could have turned out  better, and what would have happened instead if such a thing was possible.

B0007GAERG|4.0|THIS IS THE POINT WHEN I NEED EVERYBODY TO GET TO THE DANCE FLOOR!  I CAME TO HAVE A PARTY!!!    WHOOOOO! HERE WE GO NOW!  Finally, M.C. is back with a new album!  And it is a great one! WHAT!!!    Starting out with the great club song, \\"It's Like That\\", The Emancipation Of Mimi--Mimi is Mariah's nickname--is filled with cool, sexy grooves and emotional ballads.      The second single from the album, \\"We Belong Together\\" has recently hit #1 on the Billboard charts and is a song that is a more developed, mature version of something you would hear on 2002's Charmbracelet.  M.C. has also returned to more of a full voice rather than using a whisper.      \\"Shake It Off\\" is a fun track with a nice groove that incorporates the best RnB ambiance from previous albums like Butterfly.  \\"I gotta shake you off, 'cause the lovin' ain't the same and you keep on playin' games like you know I'm here to stay\\" pretty much sums up the message M.C. is conveying in this tune!    The fourth track from the album, \\"Mine Again\\", sounds very retro.  It is very much like a 1970's ballad.  And she is just singing out on this.  The vocals make this one a real gem!  Randy Jackson (American Idol) plays bass for this song as he does for a few others on the album--and on other Mariah albums, I might add.  The whole album was done with more of a live, band feel and Randy (formerly of the band JOURNEY) is just one of the great musicians she uses to create that feel.     Snoop Dogg adds his vocals to \\"Say Somethin'\\" and helps create a nice, laid back vibe on this track.   This song is good for just relaxing.    \\"Stay The Night\\", as with \\"Mine Again\\", has a very retro feel but is more up-tempo.  This is a sexy song that was co-produced by Kanye West.  Once again, M.C. uses her full voice--instead of a whisper--to great effect.  It sounds like she is going back to vocalizing as she did for 1995's Fantasy.    Jermaine Dupri (uber-producer and boyfriend to Janet Jackson) lends his writing and producing talents as well as his voice--as does longtime M.C. back-up singer, Trey Lorenz--to \\"Get Your Number\\", the seventh track on the album.  This is a flirty, sexy song that is up-tempo.  \\"Baby I just wanna hug and kiss and love ya\\" coos M.C. to the guy she's eyeing at the club.    Rapper Twista adds a subtle bit of rap to \\"One And Only\\" which is a song that feels, musically, in the same vein as \\"Clown\\" from Charmbracelet but the subject matter is different.  \\"Every time I turn around I find my heart in pieces on the ground. So, so lonely, I'm looking for my one and only.\\"    \\"Oh boy, my world has changed and I don't think I can make it without you. You've got me running around in circles over you\\" sings Mariah on T.E.O.M.'s ninth track, \\"Circles\\".  This is a mid-tempo song that, with Randy Jackson and some other great musicians and backup singers, bemoans the loss of her lover and how she keeps emotionally \\"running around\\" and \\"tumbling down\\".    I think that if there is one misstep on The Emancipation Of Mimi it might be track 10, \\"Your Girl\\".  It has a cool enough beat and some good vocals, but it seems a bit adolescent in content.  \\"I'm gonna show you clearly [that] I can rock your world\\" just seems a bit dated, immature or something.  It still can be a fun little song though.    \\"I Wish You Knew\\" sounds, at first listen, as though it is a real live track.  But it is just a sound, with clapping and cheering, that was created for an ambient effect by the producers (M.C. and James \\"Big Jim\\" Wright).  It is a really nice ballad that sounds--again, it's like a theme--retro!  Which is very cool and all the songs kind of feel older, yet modern at the same time and they all sound like they should be on the record together.  T.E.O.M. is not like some albums that sound like all the songs are too different to really be on the same album together.  M.C.'s newest creation fits together nicely and has a similarity to the vibe that is felt when you listen to it all, beginning to end.  And the photographs that are included also really capture this same feeling.      Nelly brings a great sound to \\"To The Floor\\" which is another kind of club song about being at the club! \\"You and me got business we gon' handle here tonight, whatever happens it's going down tonight\\".      \\"Joy Ride\\" is about being in love and all the physical and emotional feelings that come with that.  It has the same feeling musically as \\"Underneath The Stars\\" from 1995's Daydream.  It's a pretty song, but not one of my favorites.  It suffers from the same thing that \\"Your Girl\\" does: it's kind of a simplistic concept.    Reverend Dr. Clarence Keaton of the True Worship Church of Brooklyn, New York starts out the final track with the statement \\"Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning\\" from Psalms 30:5.   \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" is like \\"My Saving Grace\\" from 2002's Charmbracelet with the same gospel feel--if not more.  She sings about how she wants to \\"fly like a bird, take to the sky, I need you now Lord, carry me high\\".  I don't think it is as good a song as \\"My Saving Grace\\" but it tries to evoke the same emotion.    The Emancipation of Mimi has debuted #1 and has had the biggest selling opening week--403,755 units--of ANY of Mariah's previous albums!!!  Every Mariah fan already has this album and every music fan NEEDS this album!  Go get it!

0688145078|4.0|My son absolutely loves this book.  The pictures are drawn well and have lots of items that toddlers can identify: ice cream cone, apple, stroller, bottle.  I think that it will help smooth the transition to big brother/sister for a child.  The one thing that I wish is that it addressed nursing the baby.  It addresses feeding the baby and how the big brother can help hold the bottle.  This may not be a mainstream need, but I would have liked if the option of nursing was explored also: big brother can sit next to mommy and read a story while mommy nursed the baby.  Great book overall.
B000002HJD|2.0|Morrison's apologists praise this album, but it is a hard listen...and this comes from a Doors fan of over 37 years! Jim's poetry as edited into songs by The Doors has fed the myth of Jim as the great modern American Poet (although Robby Kreiger penned many lyrics commonly thought to be Morrison's), but as you listen to the spent fury of his spoken-word poetry, one quickly realizes that its very genesis comes from the pseudo-intellectualism of a teenager.  In fact, many of Morrison's songs were modifications from the ramblings in his high school notebook.  Many of the lyrics are simply vulgar and have no redeeming value to the listener (Ode to my c**k...how! How profound.)  If you're a Doors fan, like I am, certainly buy this as part of The Doors legacy and to complete the collection, but if you are a casual fan and think this is a solo album that sounds like The Doors, you are best served by passing this one over.  Listen to the sound clips on this site and I assure you that you'll pass this one by.
B00009W8N2|4.0|Great start- but the just get better with every other album. How could i give this and Deliverance and Damnation 5 stars? Again, great start for an AWESOME band!
B000002572|5.0|This album is a classic, plain and simple... <br /> <br />\\"More than a Feeling\\" might be the greatest rock song of all time, it certainly ranks equally with other classic songs that fortunately grace FM radio on classic rock stations across the country.   <br /> <br />Brad Delp's vocals were incredible during this period.  Tom Scholtz's guitar playing was innovative and at the time, original. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, for Boston fans, this album was the pinnical of their long career. <br /> <br />They have had other good albums, but this one was great, and has been in all honesty, one of the best rock and roll albums ever.
B000002JS6|4.0|I have to laugh when I see some of these 'apparent and immature' reviews. How can you give this album/CD 1 Star? First of all, not being as BIG a fan of Brian Johnson [singer], as I was of Bon Scott [thier first singer who passed away a few months before Back in Black was released-RIP BON!]but this album does not let up from start to finish! Fron the first Bell to the last Guitar chord, its pure, straight out of the gate Rock-N-Roll to the highest degree. If you are not into AC/DC but you need that one CD to help you get the blues out on a Monday morning, or a jump start on a Friday afternoon, THIS IS ONE CD THAT EVERYONE MUST HAVE IN HIS or HER COLLECTION! One star? GIVE ME A BREAK!!! Add another 3 to that 1 the review is complete! Rock On EVERYONE.

B00005UKKF|3.0|I had mixed feelings after viewing Britney Spears' Live from Las Vegas! HBO concert special.  First off, there was hardly any amazing choreography for this show, something that Spears usually has a plethora of.  Second, her rendition of her ballady single \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\" sounded a little too deep, low, and Toni Braxton-like for my liking (let alone unnatural for Britney - did the microphone not process her voice right?).  Third of all, the effects --though amazing in scale-- could confuse as easily as the questioning over Britney's \\"assetts.\\"  Britney's touching tribute to our nation's armed forces did add a tish of realness to the typically-fabricated Miss Spears.  Overall, a good but not amazing show.
B0007P3582|1.0|This is absolute trash, giving it one star is way too generous. I remember back in the day where \\"musicians\\" could read, write, and play instruments and gave great music like rock and roll. This is not music if you want the \\"real stuff\\" listen to Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Def Leppard, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, Guns 'N' Roses, Van Halen, Motley Crue, Ozzy Osbourne, Jimi Hendrix, Metallica, The Beatles, Poison, Whitesnake, and so many others. They'll show you what real music is. The Massacre and Get Rich and whatever it is should be used as frisbees instead.

B0000VCZKM|5.0|I miss these kinds of films. They are classics for the whole family. I put together a list to remind folks of some of the best ones out there that are family oriented interesting and full of great music. It blows me away when I meet a 10 year old who hasn't seen something like Sound of Music or Wizard of Oz. It's been a long time since Hollywood has come up with one of these! <br /> <br />Mary Poppins <br />Sound of Music <br />Chitty Chitty Bang Bang <br />My Fair Lady <br />Wizard of OZ <br />Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory <br />Annie <br />Oliver <br /> <br />I am an advocate of good old fasion family fun. I try and take my kids to these and other live musicals as well. We even do voice lesson Cds: (I recommend them as well) <br />\\"Voice Lessons To Go\\" by Vaccarino, to prep before we sing through their sound tracks. It's just another alternative to regular television time. There is a wholesome quality to them that sadly is not very prevelent today.
B0000028RR|5.0|I recently started getting into Rage Against the Machine, and a friend of mine recommended this album. I immediately fell in love with it. From the catchy bass riffs, amazing guitar pedal use, awesome lyrics, there's something here anyone would love.<br /><br />1. Bombtrack<br /><br />This song starts out with a very cool bass riff, and goes into the high energy music Rage is known for. The lyrics are catchy, but not as good as some of their other work.<br /><br />2. Killing in the Name<br /><br />This is probably one of Rage's best known song. It's a lot different than most of the other songs on the album, but it's good nonetheless. It's somewhat repetative though. You can find Killing in the Name featured on Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.<br /><br />3. Take the Power Back<br /><br />An awesome bass riff to start this one out, and possibly the best lyrics in any Rage song. This is one of my favorite Rage songs all on all the albums.<br /><br />4. Settle for Nothing<br /><br />This song is very slow, instead of Rage's signature high powered songs. Settle for Nothing isn't the greatest Rage song, it's somewhat bland.<br /><br />5. Bullet in your Head<br /><br />Bullet in your Head is the song that got Rage big. It has a different melody, with some crazy guitar parts. The lyrics are pretty good though.<br /><br />6. Know your Enemy<br /><br />There is one word to explain this song; amazing. High energy, awesome lyrics, sweet guitar part leading into the song, this song has it all.<br /><br />7. Wake Up<br /><br />Wake Up is known most because of The Matrix. It's featured at the very end of the movie. It starts with a great guitar part, and has amazing lyrics.<br /><br />8. Fistful of Steel<br /><br />Great use of guitar pedals in the opening of the song. It's really catchy. One of the lower points in the album however.<br /><br />9. Township Rebellion<br /><br />Brad Wilk puts his cowbells to use here. Although it doesn't have much of a melody, it's a nice song.<br /><br />10. Freedom<br /><br />Definitely one of Rage's more political songs. I personally am not that big of a fan of this song.

While Audioslave features Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk, it's not nearly the same. Chris Cornell is a good singer, but no one can compare with Zack de la Rocha. Zack was going to release a solo album in 2001, but nothing came. Fahrenheit 9/11 featured We Want it All, a song made by Zack. He's also done songs with DJ Shadow.

B000001EC1|3.0|What you're hoping to take away with this package will affect how good you think it is:<br /><br />1) An overview of the band's 'best' material from \\"Bon Jovi\\" forward...<br /><br />OR<br /><br />2) A collection of the chart hits that were blared out of radios and on MTV throughout most of the late 80s.<br /><br />If you're in the #2 group, this will be pretty good. Bon Jovi is at his best with huge sounding arena anthems, not sensitive singer-songwriter tunes. 3 big ones are missing (\\"Living in Sin\\",\\"Born to Be my Baby\\",\\"Never Say Goodbye\\") and you don't get \\"It's my Life\\" or \\"Thank You for Loving Me\\" since they weren't released until 2000's \\"Crush\\" (this collection came out in 1994) but those are the biggest nitpicks with the collection.<br /><br />There is a Japanese import version that adds on \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Tokyo Road\\" from early album \\"7800 Fahrenheit\\" (no crappy \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\" remake either)(ASIN:B0000677K0) but it'll cost you nearly 3 times what you're paying here.<br /><br />#1 category fans who insist the two most \\"metal\\" albums are the best stuff won't be happy: 1 track each from \\"Bon Jovi\\" and \\"7800 Fahrenheit\\". There's nothing from the \\"These Days\\" album at all.<br /><br />The liners are nonexistent. No lyrics...no context for the songs..just a pic of the band moping in a diner.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br /><br />Their most indelible material remains what came out on the mega-hit albums \\"New Jersey\\" and \\"Slippery When Wet\\": \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\" still sounds great played loud on your car stereo, macho fantasies \\"Blaze of Glory\\" and \\"Wanted:Dead or Alive\\" get my testosterone flowing, and \\"You Give Love a Bad Name\\" is a fist pumper everytime. Outside of those, \\"Keep the Faith\\" is a surprisingly strong later period effort that rides its chorus on shattered tremolo guitars and \\"I'll Be There for You\\" was one of their best power ballads, \\"sensitive\\" without being mawkish. \\"Runaway\\" was the breakthrough tune for the group and holds up pretty well even with the 80s-ish keyboard on the intro.<br /><br />LOWS:<br /><br />\\"Always\\" takes the worst excesses of power ballads and amplifies them. All awash in strings and syrupy sentiment, it's a pile of goo. \\"Bed of Roses\\" wastes what could have been a good song by not bothering to write a good hook and letting it run WAY too long (6 1/2 minutes of this dreck? Please...) His lyric about being on the road away from his woman (\\"Well I'm so far away/That each step that I take is on my way home/A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night/Just to see through this payphone\\") is one of his better ones but it's wasted here. \\"Prayer '94\\", an unplugged remake of \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\", was probably an attempt to place the focus on the lyric (which to be fair is a good one) but it saps all the power out of the song. The song just NEEDS to be pumped up with Sambora's guitar chords.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Bon Jovi is a singles band. Buy this and you've got most of their best. You'll probably want to get \\"New Jersey\\" and \\"Slippery...\\" used cheap to have the missing 3. You can always burn them onto your own anthology.<br /><br />3 stars (lost a star because of liners/missing hits)up pretty well even with the 80s-ish keyboard on the intro. <br /> <br />LOWS: <br />\\"Always\\" takes the worst excesses of power ballads and amplifies them.

B0006L5RT2|4.0|James Blunt`s voice sounds like a cross between Tracy Chapman and Elton John. Very soulful, with emotional peaks and valleys that work extremely well his \\"folk-pop-funk-blues\\" musical compositions. A relaxing, and often mesmerizing listen dealing primarily with the lingering affects of love, loss, and longing. \\"Back to Bedlam\\" is a very personal album. Sometimes soft. Sometimes hard. Always real. Suggested listening environment: a quiet place, a smooth wine, a special person.

B0001DI0FI|4.0|I was worried this would just be Gladiator on the High Seas..but I was very pleased with the results.  This film is wonderful.  It's period and naval history is unequaled.  I've never seen a movie that shows so much of 19th century naval tradition and warfare.  If you are a military history buff, you will really appreciate the level of detail in this movie.  Especially if you opt for this special edition with loads of extra stuff.    If you are less on history and more on action, this movie also has plenty to offer.  You will be dazzled as Captain Aubrey and his crew aboard the HMS Surprise stick it to the Frenchies!  The violence is gritty and shocking, but relevant to the style of warfare and reality of the time.    However don't be fooled by the violence and militaristic machismo in this movie.  This movie is as smart and sophisticated as they come.  The character development between the Captain and his Doctor best-friend is as compelling as the action in the film.  And the sophistication really kicks in when there is a scene where they play a violin-cello duet (some felt this was too slow of a scene but I felt it was a great relaxiing break from all the tension).  And the story takes a much more scientific turn when the ship visits the Galapagos.  There is a recurring theme of adaptation and evolution throughout the film.    Simply put, this is the SMARTEST guy flik I've ever seen.  Its rewarding on both an action and intellectual level.  However, it is still a very masculine dominated story.  My fiance was bored to tears watching it.  There is maybe 15 seconds of a female in the entire film, and after that its all testosterone from there.  (The trailers were misleading, they showed the face of that 15 second woman to trick you into thinking there is romance in the story, when there really isnt.)    The acting by Crowe and Bettany was great.  All other production values of the film are top notch.
0790742780|3.0|I like one of the other people here really couldn't take the film for the first time watching it; To me it's far too real. We as a country, and as a people of this country have been falling down for the last 20+ years. Our values have been changed, and or twisted to survive. It seems as though we want to please everybody, and yet please nobody. Men and Women these days can't just give each other a friendly hug unless the man has a yearly income of 6-7 figures, and anything goes as sexual harrassment anymore. Racism is not going away quietly in fact it's probably worse now than it was 30-40 years ago. Paranoia is everyone's favorite neighborhood to live in; that way they can justify throwing stones at a glass house. For one man enough was enough. The American Dream was dead to him as he was divorced, and his ex-wife wanted nothing more to do with him, he was downsized from his job, and looking for new work, getting stuck on the freeway in 95 degree heat just makes one man finally say \\"Enough is Enough\\". \\"I'm Mad As Hell, And I'm Not Going To Take It ANYMORE!!!\\" However, the problem is that this is not what the man wants to really do, but everyone he encounters feels that this is his lot in life. He's a white supremicist, White collar, psycho with pocket protector and a baseball bat. He becomes a hero to one, a robber to another, and a wise-ass old man to a bunch of punks. He just wanted to go home, and see his daughter, he wanted some food, and everyone thought he would do some harm if they didn't comply with his wishes, and he wasn't out to play thier games why stereotype him? Is society's goal that much of a sacred cow to have everyone labeled, and thrown into a file cabinet under thier proper type? Why is it that important? Mind you I'm writing this shortly after listening to Janis Ian's 1967 hit \\"Society's Child\\", and I'm feeling some bitterness right now. However, after this movie was released National Enquier released an article with Michael Douglas who playedthe man in this movie being quoted as saying he hates what America has become. In a lot of ways I have too. Unfortunately, alot of the hippies that hated America 30-40 years before have developed the same callous attitude that thier fathers passed on to them. \\"Love It, or Leave It\\". \\"There's the door; you can leave if you want to.\\" Like \\"First Blood\\" there's alot of prejudice in this movie, and all the man wants is an anchor to hold onto as his life is in a extreme downward spiral, and all people can do is pass the buck, so they don't have to deal with him. Instead of his wife telling him to just get some help from a shrink there could've been an opprtunity to try, and get him to spill his guts some more, and maybe reconcile, but that's the way of the world anymore. \\"God Helps Those Who Help Themselves\\", and \\"I Don't Want To Hear It; You're Disturbing My Karma.\\" No one wants to help because that would mess up society's file cabinet, and they themselves could get messed up doing that. The unfortunate character was that of Robert Duvall who had to shoot Douglas on his last day on the police force. I'm sure the character was a reasonable man otherwise, but that's what we'll unfortunately remember. The law must be observed and protected. It's a cold place here anymore, and until we can really mean the words \\"Come On People Now; Smile On Your Brother...Everybody Get Together, Try To Love One Another Right Now.\\" the world will remain a very cold and desolate place where everyone must suffer in silence because they believe that's the way they show that they're strong.
B000002UA9|1.0|Like many, we still have our vinyl stashed or stored away; whatever happen to the days when it was front and center in our dwellings? If you're like me, I guess I'm keeping them just to retain a bit of my youth. I have a vinyl copy of this album, with the original plastic, which I purchased at a discount store in the early 1970's, for the sum of $1.99! It, along with all my other Beatle albums, make for a nice display in the guest room of our home, as well as an interesting conversation piece. <br />I really enjoyed hearing some for the more \\"obscure\\" Beatle songs recorded on the \\"Please,Please Me\\" album. Hearing the Fab Four performing and recording material not written by Lennon & McCartney takes these songs and transform them into the Beatlesque style that the group was so famous for. It also demostrates that good, pop songs need not be over 3 minutes long. <br />If you enjoy the Beatle's music, I recommed purchasing this album. It really shows their musical tallent and professional approach to pop music. Besides, I don't even own a turtable anymore, so how am I going to make use of my $1.99 bargin?
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I bought this and got my wife into after we both heard \\"Oh What A World\\" on the radio.  Hearing the Bolero quotes was very impressive.  The only Rufus music we owned before that was his cover of Across the Universe on the I Am Sam soundtrack.  When we first started listening, I liked it a lot but was bored by one or two songs and I started to skip over them and another track or two to get to the ones that I immediately knew that I liked.  But after repeated listenings, I realized how great the songs I skipped were and that I should really absorb the whole work in its' entirety.  Ever since, I have been raving about this cd to friends.  I'm typically (being a big Moody Blues fan) very into incorporating orchestration in rock music and this is the best job of that in recent memory.  The layers of vocal tracks, and horns (I'm also a trumpet player), and orchestra just blow me away!  If that's the style of music you like, then you MUST have this cd.  The two standout tracks are \\"Go Or Go Ahead\\" and \\"Beautiful Child.\\"  These two songs are instant classics in my opinion.  I
0441172717|5.0|Wonderful book. It's hard to know what to say about a title like this that's been reviewed by so many people, but we're all suppose to have a voice here. I might as well add mine. I loved this book. It's particularly amazing for me to imagine that this was written years ago, before so much of the sci-fi we've gotten used to ever existed. Perhaps Herbert is part of why what's come since was even imaginable. To think that this had trouble finding a publisher! I'm sure the reason for that is that it's so unique, so individually unusual, so speculatively imaginative. I don't think anyone should judge this series on either of the movies that have been made from it. They both pale in comparison to the original. I guess, frankly, that Herbert's work triumphs purely because he's a genious who found his way of leaving a legacy on the world. Read and enjoy this book. It's a ride like none other, and it'll leave you thinking.
B000059HAI|5.0|Nominated for five Academy Awards (most of them related to effects and visuals), and winner of the Oscar for Special Visual Effects, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a true Hollywood blockbuster. Long before the star-studded, over-hyped Disney film Pearl Harbor, film creators gave us a much better picture of the events surrounding December 7, 1941. Often shown on the History Channel, Tora! Tora! Tora! almost fits the definition of a documentary. The film doesn't employ sideshow tricks such as love triangles (i.e. Pearl Harbor) in order to create audience interest. In fact, few of the actors stand out on their own. Instead, each character plays his part as it most likely unfolded in real life - and the real life version of Pearl Harbor is interesting enough on its own... <br /> <br />Tora! Tora! Tora! originates as the Japanese call sign for a full-fledged attack on the American naval installation at Pearl Harbor. When the Japanese Empire continues its expansion throughout the Asian-Pacific realm, the United States institutes economic sanctions. As further divisions threaten to bring about war between the two nations, Japanese admirals convene in order to plan a surprise preemptive attack on the United States Navy in the event that war becomes inevitable. <br /> <br />Among those present is Admiral Yamamoto (So Yamamura) who agrees to carry out the plan, but as a man who studied extensively in the United States, he believes his fellow countrymen underestimate the resolve and the industrial might of the American people. Nonetheless, the Japanese continue their surveillance of Pearl Harbor with a plan to annihilate the US Navy and its vital fleet of aircraft carriers. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, certain people in Washington are intercepting coded messages between the island of Japan and its ambassador to the United States. As the rumor of a Japanese attack begins to take hold, officials attempt to convince the top leaders in the chain of command. But the idea of such a bold and unprovoked attack is difficult to comprehend. <br /> <br />When the Japanese arrive at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, they realize their plan has worked well. They achieve total surprise, and the call of Tora! Tora! Tora! goes out to the fleet, launching a second wave of attack planes. The Japanese attacks sink several battleships, but not a single carrier (the carriers unexpectedly left the harbor to practice maneuvers). Threatening to annihilate Pearl Harbor, the Japanese are unexpectedly called back by a conservative admiral, leaving the scene before than can inflict maximum damage. The mistake is eloquently expressed by Admiral Yamamoto who fears that his countrymen have \\"only managed to awaken a sleeping giant\\"... <br /> <br />Despite its 1970 release date, Tora! Tora! Tora! remains a wonderful film that can hold its own in the special effects department with any modern day blockbuster. In fact, the older camera technology makes the scenes subconsciously feel more realistic than modern day films such Pearl Harbor. If you're looking for a good, suspenseful movie (and one which teaches history too), then you'll be hard pressed to find a better option than Tora! Tora! Tora! One of the best war films of all time, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a definite must see film... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00005LANG|5.0|It is always interesting to follow Bob Marley's career from his early rude boy years, to the rock steady years, to the ska years, to reggae, to the roots, rock, reggae which this set shows itself. As so many other reviewers have said this has to be Bob Marley and the Wailers at their absolute tightest. Tight because of how tightly compacted and densely thick the drum lines are, delivered with startling accuracy. Tight because the guitars, and organs, and instruments have never sounded so heavy and so right before. Tight because there's no longer the dense weed smoke hanging in the air that clouded up some parts of Catch a Fire and earlier recordings. Instead now, now Marley is clear on, leaving no lyric to chance, and leaving no sound to the inspiration of the atmosphere: rather he's MAKING the atmosphere with his sound. Tight because his vocals have never been so right on before. If I had to stack all the records Bob and the Wailers (Peter Tosh and Bunny included) ever made, this would be the singular one I would choose. This is the best album Robert Nesta Marley, O.M. ever made, uniting world styles of music with the dreams of a little boy from St. Ann's Parish who on this record, has become a man of startling musical and lyrical power.    The album opens with Natural Mystic, a remake. Many times you will find that Bob remade some of the hits that he, Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh recorded back in their ska and rude boy years. This is one of them. Natural Mystic was recorded in a ska (a folkish jazzy sort of form of reggae) a few years earlier completely with trumpets, and orchestraic instruments. This time, Marley choose a more straight-forward and blunt delivery, his voice quiet, more mournful than it was in the ska version. While the trumpets are still here their last boastful as they were in the earlier version. Marley gives the song a hint of fatality that makes it quite profound.     So Much Things to Say follows next. This song was redone by his daughter-in-law, Grammy winning singer/songstress/philosopher Lauryn Hill some years later on her classic Unplugged 2.0 collection, and one can see why a songwriter of her caliber chose to do this as a remake. It has a classical no b.s. attitute towards the things people say. Marley acknowldeges that old axiom \\"Sticks and stones can break my bones but words can never hurt me\\" is a complete lie. He says that words can hurt you, but only if you stop to listen. But if you know who you are, you know what you believe, and you know what you represent, it doesn't matter. This message is delivered over a rapturous accompaniment with joyful doo-wop style of vocals by the I-Threes    Guiltiness is next. He talks about hypocrites, liars, and backstabbers in this song, aknowledging that even they have a heart, but that that heart is filled with guiltiness. Unless they turn from their ways \\"Woe to the downpressers, for they shall eat the bread of sorry\\" he cries over a darker background than the earlier music.    Heathen is a sort of chanting kind of mantra against the Spiritual Enemy, as Marley and the I-Threes cry: Jah put dah heathen back deh, pon deh wall, or in American english: God, put the heathen back there against the wall, requesting that God help him fight the battle against the Heathen both spiritual, mental, and physical.     The album's title track comes in next. It's called Exodus. It's suprisingly long. In the Wailers (Bob, Peter, and Neville \\"Bunny\\") ska years they usually wrote songs that were about 2 minutes long, so it's a big jump to see him writing a 7-plus minute track. This is a very politically minded song, and it's not entirely catchy except for it's chorus Exodus movement of Jah people, which itself is not that catchy. It's more a political dictation that you really have to listen to. It fit well in the 70's, but now, it's more something you'll want to listen, and because of how heavy he made the beat and instruments it's more something you march to than dance to.Next has got to be one of Marley's tightest dance tracks, Jammin. The beat says it all. This is Carlton Barret at his best, proving himself one of the most exceptional drummers in the known world with tight dense delivery and transcendent ability in regards to reggae. The way he switches rhythms in the middle of the drum line without ever disrupting the flow, constantly back and forth to some three to five different rhythms is absolutely amazing. Marley delivers lyrics about dancing in the name of the Lord, a righteous party here.    Waiting in Vain is a sweet love song over a sweeter accompaniment. Here the Wailers, usually hard up on rhythm and power, deliver a sweet as honey background to Marley's declaration that he will knock on her door for as long as she wants, and he'll wait for her love for as long as she says, but he just wants to know that he isn't waiting in vain. He'll wait forever, but he needs a promise that one days he'll get some reciprocity. It's a beautiful sentiment, and Bob as usual delivers it with shocking honesty and sentiment.    Next is one of Bob's, or maybe it IS Bob's best love song. For me it's his best, and what he brings to it is emotional. It has the feeling of new love, young love, passionate, full of light and emotion. His daughter-in-law, Grammy winning singer Lauryn Hill did a duet of this song with his voice, using computer technolongy. The duet made Natalie Cole and Nat King Cole's technology-aided duet seem tame, and makes you believe that if she had married his son while he was still alive, they might have actually done this duet together. They have the same views, and their voices so well together, his Marley's rough, and Hill's so smooth that it works. Check Chant Down Babylon, an album made by Marley's son Stephen, for this duet. But the original version is by far the best. The accompaniment is trance like and Marley's vocals are admirable. Here that feeing of smoke hanging in the air returns, but this time it's a moreorganic, natural vibe, and sensual sort of trance-like rapture, that transcends time and space, titanic yet captured at the same time. It's a great love song.    Three Little Birds is  nice feel good song, and it works well. Enjoyable.    The monster hit One Love is next. This song has been played so much that it's self explanatory.    The two bonus tracks are great. The long version of Jammin lets Carlton Barrett give a transcendental execution of drumplay. If you don't marvel at how Barrett handles those drums, and how ridiculously wonderful that bass line is, then hand over your heart and your musical taste, because you have no need for them in regards to modern music. The next track Punky Reggae Party is insatiable and irrepressable. I dare you not to start jumping around your bedroom or living room as if you're in a Jamaican basement party. If your feet are not at least tapping uncontrollably, then again, hand over your heart and musical taste.    This is Bob at his ABSOLUTE FINEST. THe ska years saw Bob discovering his style. The ska years have their own feeling and are just as enjoyable as the reggae years, this is back when folk and jazz music from New Orleans pervaded Jamaica, and the Wailers (who were then Bob Marley, Peter McIntosh (Peter Tosh) and Neville \\"Bunny Wailer\\" Livingston) were ample exponents of that style, brilliantly delivering it. The rude boy years saw a young teenage Bob ascending from the ghetto's of Trenchtown with a fierce attitude, a courageous heart, and a raw talent as he was discovering his voice. The early Island recordings saw Bob consumating it. But it is Exodus that pushes Bob into a realm of superstardom so spectacular that Time was forced to declare this the album of the Century. That decision has got to be unanimous.    -Terrence Craft
B00003CXPJ|4.0|In the past eight years, no man in Hollywood has been a bigger box office hit than Ben Stiller. Zoolander is one reason why. Following previous mega-hit comedies There's Something About Mary and Meet The Parents, Stiller once again joins with Owen Wilson to create a comedy that is second to none in this decade. In this film, Stiller plays the role of Derek Zoolander, a male model dominating the international fashion landscape with his trademark pose \\"Blue Steel\\". <br /> <br />Winner of the \\"Male Model Of The Year\\" for several consecutive years, Zoolander is the most widely successful male model in history. But age is taking its hold, and Hansel McDonald (Owen Wilson) is the newest smash hit model on the scene. When Hansel steals the male model crown from Zoolander, the fading model is forced to search for a new identity. When Time magazine reporter Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor) runs a cover story portraying Derek as a mindless idiot, he decides to retire from the modeling business and reconcile with his family... <br /> <br />Problems arise, however, when Zoolander's family rejects him. He fails to project the manly image to which they aspire. However, the saving grace for Derek is Jacobin Mugatu (Will Ferrell), a celebrated fashion designer who offers Derek the deal of a lifetime as the exclusive model for his brand new 'Derelicte' line. Unbeknownst to Zoolander, Mugatu and a cartel of fashion designers have secretly convened and decided to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Promising to institute a minimum wage, the new Prime Minister threatens to destroy the endless supply of cheap labor on which the fashion cartel relies for excessive profits. Together, they agree to brainwash a stupid fashion model into carrying out their assassination for them. The cartel chooses Mugatu as the man to carry out the mission, and Mugatu chooses Zoolander as his idiot male model. <br /> <br />Unaware of the events surrounding him, Zoolander befriends the journalistwho made him laughing stock, and he and Matilda become romantically involved. She begins to see him as more than just a pretty face. In another twist, Zoolander also befriends Hansel, the male model who knocked him off his throne. With Mugatu's new line soon to be unveiled, and the Prime Minister of Malaysia in attendance as his special guest, only Hansel and Matilda can help Derek to overcome his brainwashing before he kills the Prime Minister and sparks an international crisis... <br /> <br />Yet again, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson exhibit their diversity in the big screen comedy genre. The characters are outlandish, and a bit more ridiculous than the subtle humor roles both men play in Meet The Parents and Meet The Fockers. But funny is funny, and Zoolander is a hilarious comedy. It's not the best of either man's career, but the film makes for a good night of entertainment...  <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00000ADG2|5.0|For years Lauryn Hill was known as L-Boogie. A dominating and beautiful female rapper whose lyrics were considered as complex as those of rap's elite Tupac, Nas, Rakim, and Guru. Her voice had all the grit, passion, and street sensibility of the most hardcore male rapper, yet she still manager to be beautiful. And L-Boogie could sing too, she could really hold on tune.  <br /> <br />When her group the Fugees first came out with Blunted on Reality, they bombed big time and were treated as a joke group. It seems like they switched the sophomore jinx up, experiencing that on their first album, so that when the sophomore album hit, it hit big. They sold more than 17 million copies won several Grammy's and were superstars. Lauryn really demonstrated how beautiful her voice was on the hit remake of Roberto Flack's Killing Me Softly. BUT NOTHING from the Score could have prepared the music community for the Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. <br /> <br />Instantly it became a classic, with four hit singles, Can't Take My Eyes Off you, Doo Wop (That Thing), Ex-Factor, and Lost One propelling it forward. It's eclectic blend of sounds and styles was genius, but it was that voice, that nearly immaculate voice that propeled Lauryn into the ranks of the great. <br /> <br />The album opens with an intro that shows Lauryn cutting class. When the teacher calls her name, she's no there to say present. This incidicates that what she's about to tell you, are things she couldn't learn in a world of academia alone. These are life lessons. <br /> <br />Next is Lost Ones, usually considered an album opening slice at her bandmate Wyclef Jean, who was usually considered the genius of their group Fugees. She opens with \\"It's funny how money change the situation, miscommunication leads to complication\\" Significantly a host of male voice (the Marley Boys, she's married to one of Bob Marley's sons) open this track by repeating her Fugees' name L-Boogie, and you can't help but feel they're saying to indicate her indenpendance. When the Fugees reunited at Dave Chappelle's block party in 2004, she even performed this song: Wyclef sat in a chair strumming his guitar to it, rolling his eyes while Lauryn and Pras walked around him in circles as if directing it to him, perhaps a confirmation that it was intended as a swipe at Wyclef. It's a great political and spiritual message that accompanies this song. <br /> <br />Next is one of the most passionate songs you'll ever encounter. Ex-Factor. Usually famous singers like Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston would start off quiet and then build to a grand crescendo. Lauryn starts off on a grand crescendo and builds to a tidal wave. This song's lyrics are so simple and yet so emotional that they alone can move you, but when coupled with her soulful voice, so thick with emotion that it drips honey coated tears, and sunwashed memories, one can't help by cry along with her, \\"Who do I have to be to get some reciprocity, see no one loves you more than, and no one ever will\\". <br /> <br />Next is an ode to her son Zion, named after him. She displays her full three to four octave voice range, and her dynamics going from soft and low to voluminous and loud towards the end of the song. And directly at the end she hits a note so high, you didn't know she had it in her. The martial drums and grand production only serve to highlight her song of how a young mother at the height of fame chose love, even if it might cost her her career. Subsequent events bore witness to the fact that it cost her nothing at all. <br /> <br />Doo Wop (That Thing) is the biggest hit of the album, and not suprisingly one can see why. The backing music is catchy to the point it is infectious, and her lyrics deliver awareness of social issues but still enough street credibility to avoid being preachy, she's just sharing. The chorus is catchy and displays her sweet voice. <br /> <br />The next song Superstar is a call-out to bad rappers and musicians who hands downsuck at making music. Her lazy delivery and demeanor on this song is purposeful, as she says, \\"Music is supposed to inspire, how come we ain't getting no higher\\". <br /> <br />Final Hour is a display of Lauryn's unique vocabulary and wordplay at it's best. Hands down she's on top of her game, mixing words together in the third verse that you don't expect possible: I'mma get the mozzarella, like a Rockafella, still be in the church of Lalibella, singing hymns a capella, whether posed in Arabela in Couture, or collecting residuals from off the score, I'm making sure I with the 144 (in reference to the 144,000 who will be allowed into heaven), I been here before this ain't a battle this is war\\". Deep <br /> <br />When It Hurts So Bad is an emotional love-lost song to rival Ex-Factor for emotion and vocal delivery, but it still comes short of Ex-Factor's intensity. <br /> <br />I Used to Love Him is a duet with singer Mary J. Blige about redemption after a lost love <br /> <br />Forgive Them Father is a beautiful song with an absolutely gorgrous vocal delivery. But like Lauryn's hardcore style, she makes it a little rough around the edges by giving it a Jamican reggae feel, a Jamaican speech introduction from Shelly Thunder. In addition, in the credits Lauryn reveals that the music is actually a modern interpretation of Concrete Jungle by her father in-law Bob Marley, and if you listen you'll see that the beat is similar and the music is practically a direct copy except for some subtle changes to make hers unique. A great song here with political and spirtual messages. <br /> <br />Every Ghetto, Every City is a feel good song of nostaligia and days of old, reveling in her childhood years. <br /> <br />Nothing Even Matters is a professio of a love so strong that nothing else matters. A duet with D'Angelo, it reveals their two voices melding together perfectly. <br /> <br />Everything is Everything is a positively charged song with a great message, an absolute infectiousparty groove, and a dedicated vocal delivery from Lauryn. Current star John Legend provided the piano on this track. <br /> <br />The title track actually completes the album, and you'll see why. Gorgeous piano arpeggios, tremolos, trills, and crescendi (plural for crescendo, yes I'm a musician :-) ) fill out this track complete with strings and a background sound effect that replicates the crackling sound of an old LP giving this record a very nostalgic 60's Sam Cooke Change is Gonna Come, or Bob Dylan Blowing in the Wind feel. Lauryn's vocal delivery here is spectacular here and emotional, giving us a glimpse of things to come from her second album Unplugged: the way she fills out this track with nothing but her voice and a piano is prophetic of the material she will bring 3 years later with the prophetic and revolutionary album, Unplugged 2.0. <br /> <br />The two hidden tracks are Can't Take My Eyes of You, a remake and a beautiful one, and finally Tell Him, a remix of the Sweetest Thing, with the same beat, just made a lil better, new words, new melody, but the same guitar and mellow feel as the Sweetest Thing. One could suffice to say Tell Him is a modern interpretation of the Sweetest Thing. <br /> <br />I've said enough, I believe. Get the album. This is music at it's peak form. It doesn't get any better than this, and it never will. At least I don't think so :-) <br /> <br />-Terrence <br /> <br />

B0006A9FMI|4.0|If your like me your copy of GIS 2 come with the Hearing Impair subtitles track. But, no regular subtitle track. That is a mistake DreamWorks made. It suppose to have a regular subtitle track too. What DreamWorks is doing is replacing the faulty DVD's. Just type in the link below. It will take you to the GIS 2 replacement form page.( [...] ) Just follow the instructions. I just mail my DVD back and got an email saying they got the DVD and the corrected DVD will be mail to me in a few weeks. I'm giving the disc 4 stars because DreamWorks dealt with the problem instead of ignoring it.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Picking up this album i didnt know what to expect. Was i ever surprised when i put this cd on the first time. I thought i was listening to something right out of the 80s, or late 70s.  <br /> <br />Great music+great lyrics+great vocals= one fantasic cd you can crank up and dance to.
0743454537|5.0|This was one of our book club selections.  Very engrossing and thought-provoking.  I liked it so well, I'm starting another novel by this author.  Give it a try--I think you'll be glad you did.
B0002OERI0|5.0|What an album! Every song on here is amazing. Green Day has made what is very well going to be considered their masterpiece. Anyone that says that Green Day sold out when this came out, is wrong. Green Day didnt sell out...they got better.  <br /> <br />A classic. In 10 years, you will still find people listening to this cd. Amazing.
B00009W0U4|3.0|I gotta admit, before I even viewed this film I already had my review in mind.  And, wouldn't you know it, what I expected to see in this film, is exactly what I saw, and what I now intend to say are almost exactly the sam thing e as what I expected to write of this film.  So maybe my view is tainted.  But I don't think so.  It's difficult to imagine a film that could more easily be described then 'Irreversible', a film which is the absolute height of pretension: This film is supremely arty, but not remotely complex.  It sometimes displays great artistry and technical precision, is sometimes flatly asinine, and is always cheap and manipulative.  And while I can't say that I really found it to be terribly disturbing, I'll admit that 'Irreversible' is about as unsettling as any film I've seen. I'm not very readily effected by violence in films, so lots of people will probably find this movie very powerful.  But, just because a film effects doesn't make it great, or even good.  It may just be being cheap, which is what this film is doing.<br /><br />The plot is utter simplicity.  Boyfriend (Marcus) and Girlfriend (Alex) go to a party, they fight, Girlfriend leaves, gets severely raped and beaten, so Boyfriend and Ex-Boyfriend go out seeking revenge, and get it.  The end.  Most famously, this film is shown in reverse chronological order, thus adding phony depth to this simplistic plot, along with the even more simplistic moral which is verbally stated in the film: Time destroys everything.  Frankly, I've never been terribly impressed by the whole showing films out of chronological order, as it is a cheap tactic.  I'm not opposed to cheap tactics in and of themselves, but I do dislike them when they are used to make some big statement, when the filmmaker thinks he's being so very smart by using them.  Noe is cheap here, because the thematic justification for showing the film backwards is weak.  Showing the film backwards simply allows Noe to deprive us of important information,  just because it would be more powerful let us know this stuff at the end.  This is different from the most famous backward movie, 'Memento' which does justify the structure by having a main character with no short term memory, thus making the reverse order the best way to put ourselves in his position.  Or look at a film like 'Kill Bill', which is shown out of order to simply manipulate the audience, but this is acceptable because that is a deliberately shallow film, with no purposes other than entertainment.  I'll allow you to be cheap when were just trying to have fun, but not in an art house film.  That, and showing it in reverse order doesn't really add much anyway.  Yes, it allows us to see just how everything had to come together for the final events to occur, but you could have seen that plenty well showing it in chronological order,  You'd just have to think a little.  That and he uses some incredibly lame tactics, such as when Alex talks about a book she's reading which says that the future is already written, or talks about her dream in a red tunnel.  Ooh, you are a clever one Noe.  (though I hear the dialogue was generally improvised, so maybe Bellucci came up with this crap on her own.  I dunno.)  Of course, if he had shown it in chronological order have the audience would've walked out anyway, but from boredom rather than offense.  More on that later.<br /><br />Stylistically, this film is a mixed bag.  Sometimes the wild camera movements and extremely long takes are impressive, sometimes they are obnoxious.  This is particularly notable at the beginning of the film, where the camera is flailing around with utter abandon.  This is somewhat disorienting, but it's mostly just obnoxious and taken to utterly ridiculous extremes.  Note the opening scene, where to characters just sit in a room, talking, while the camera wanders around at random, focusing on the light fixtures or the corner or whatever.  Though I'll admit, this does work well for contrast, as the violent scenes are typical shown with very, very little camera movement, as is the second half of the film, which takes place before the tragic events shown earlier.<br /><br />This films reputation is actually deserved, as far as graphic violence is concerned.  The arm-breaking scene is extremely painful, and the face-pulverization with the fire extinguisher is probably the most brutal piece of violence I've ever seen in a film.  And, the rape is very nasty too, and, to Noe's credity, it is shot in such a way so as to be as inexploitive as possible considering how extremely intense it is.  (i.e. nudity is kept to a minimum)  These scenes are effective, but much of the rest of the film is asinine.  The scenes at the party and just before it are quite boring, and really don't give us all that much information on the characters.  The endless dialogue between Pierre, Marcus and Alex, mostly prattling on and on about sex in some fashion or another, is spectacularly tedious.  In some ways, these scenes take away from the later scenes, as Marcus proves to be an utterly loathsome prick, not worthy of any sympathy, though he is redeemed somewhat by the opening scene between him and Alex, which is probably the only scene in the second half of the movie which is truly worthwhile.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, I'm virtually impossible to offend, but you can irritate me.  And, just about the best way to irritate me is to *try* and be offensive.  Virtually all of the<br />'extreme' cinema I've seen seems to be catered towards the interests of those who can watch this sorta thing.  It will offend or disturb many people, but it's not made for this purpose.  Personally, the graphic nature of this film just seems like it was meant to offend mainstream audiences, and, if possible, offend even the core audience.  Why I get this impression from this film is difficult to pinpoint, but there's little doubt in my mind that I'm correct.  That's probably my biggest beef with this movie.<br /><br />The End.olent scenes are typical shown with very, very little camera movement, as is the second half of the film, which takes place before the tragic events shown earlier.

B0002BO0AS|3.0|There is a lot to like in this album, and a lot to hope for in the future.  Each song features several mosh elements, and transitions that keep the songs' flow alive and interesting.  However, the changes come so frequently and unexpectedly that there's very little to hold onto, minute to minute.  Once Unearth finds a hook, they seem rather eager to let it go.  So, ultimately, the complaints about songs running into one another have validity - more critically, there aren't really \\"songs\\" on this album - like I said, TOS is more an agglomeration of \\"mosh movements\\".<br /><br />TOS live should be a blast - this album seems more geared towards that, rather than to be enjoyed with friends, in the car, screaming along to, or as part of your singles collection.  Though I guarantee you won't be bored listening... that's the benefit of music that's always changing.  Mudvayne had this \\"problem\\" previously - they seem to have survived and thrived in spite.  These equally-talented boys will doubtless do the same.
B0000797IO|4.0|Jennifer Aniston's movie career hasn't amounted to a hill of beans, mostly due to her inability to pick good roles.  Here though, whether through the luck of a blind squirrel finding an acorn now and then or better career management, she's honed in on a great anti-'Friends' tonic with Mike White's finely-tuned script.  [White also appears as Aniston's bible study-going buddy.]<br /><br />The best thing to say about 'The Good Girl' is that it won't appeal to fans of Aniston's 'Rachel' persona.  That's a 'go' signal for all of us fans of smaller, Independent Spirit-sized releases who would otherwise tend to lump an Aniston-led film into the category of \\"Friends vehicle. Won't see.\\"
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is a landmark for mariah, she has the best style.  <br />the first single its like that was just the begining for this great work of art, thats what i see it as anyway the best work of her 15 year carrer i am so glad she made we belong together the second single to me its her best song ever lyrically and vocally she is amazing
B00006879E|5.0|This is Maroon 5's debut and it is a strong start to a band that shows so much promise. There are a number of songs on this album release that have become hits to the fans and romantics as well. Songs like This Love, She Will Be Loved are made for romantic evenings in with your special someone with soft slow sensual beats to slow dance too.<br /><br />The you have suave songs like The Sun and Sunday Morning that one would love to hold their special someone close and listen whilst relaxing on a weekend. Another great song and possibly the unsung hero of the CD release is the last song, Sweetest Goodbye. Now this is a song that should have been a hit from the start. Many of the songs are sung with a vigour by Adam that leaves many leads wanting.
0385470819|4.0|This book held my interest from beginning to end.  There were no boring sections and was well written.  Two white men rape and beat a ten year old black girl.  Her father finds justice by killing them and is put on trial.  The book examines the difference between races.  Would popular opinion be different if two black men raped and beat a white girl?  Great book.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Love it.  Love it, Love it, Love it.  Especially No Good Deed, Defying Gravity, I'm Not that Girl, and The Wizard and I.  Highly reccommended, even though I've never seen the play.  I am reading the book though, and it is excellant!
B00005JKJA|4.0|Owl Creek Bridge meets Day of the Locust. Another surreal dreamscape from Lynch. Good performances by Watts and Theroux. A few scenes didn't fit, though. They seemed to belong to another movie: loose ends, no doubt, from the projected TV mini-series that never came to fruition. I'm not the biggest fan of David Lynch, but I did find this one fairly compelling and memorable. Some have complained that the film is totally inscrutable, but those who managed to follow the storyline of Memento shouldn't have too much difficulty with this one. Just bear in mind that the first persona we encounter is only an idealized self-image in the fever dream of a mean little failure with a ugly soul. Enjoy.    Good transfer but NO extras at all--not even a menu or scene selections, for crying out loud! Cheap b@stards.
B00008ADPF|1.0|Nobody gets on the radio without the backing of a major label who spend on average $300,000 per song per \\"artist\\".  ALL music heard on commercial radio has been extensively market researched using focus groups.  So the music you hear on radio is deliberately chosen, if not designed, to appeal to the most people in the demographic that is being marketed to.  Because so much money is at stake both in terms of profit and promotion, major record companies are interested not in music, but in moving product.  Art and integrity don't matter, only sales.  That is why we have bland, musical junkfood like Nickleback's The Long Road clogging up the airwaves.  And it's only going to get worse as more and more radio stations or marketing outlets are owned by fewer and fewer corporations.  Art by committee sucks folks.  As a marketing device Nickleback are brilliant, as music they stink on ice.  This is about as mindlessly commercial as it gets.
B00063MBU8|1.0|What is wrong with this dude's voice?  Has he got the cold or something?  Hey Pierre, if you're going to record an album, at least wait until your cold clears up so you can sing in a clear voice!
B00005R23X|5.0|I watched both versions of this movie. I must say that the Superbit version makes the movie ten times better. With the incredible sound and crisp picture, I would have to suggest this version. <br />As far as the movie, what can I say....personally I think Gary Oldman makes a terrifying Dracula, the portration is not only freakishly scary but also very sensual. As for Keanu Reeves character, all I could think about was \\"Bill and Ted\\" He was horrible.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This album is, in fact, a masterpiece. The way all of the music goes together is magnificent. Every song of this album is brilliant and enjoyable. You need to own this album.

B000062TU1|5.0|The film brings to the screen the story of (the very well known by now) Harry Potter, a boy, who discovers that he has significant magic powers.  If that wasn't enough, he soon realizes that there might be more to his existence than he would ever have thought possible...   <br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with strong elements of fantasy, not to mention some very witty humor.  <br />Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again. <br />The concept, the setting, the special effects, and the music, are all EXCELLENT!  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  In short, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! <br />
0670033375|3.0|The first 450 pages of this book are interesting (albeit repetitive), but after talking about all of the problems caused by overpopulation (especially by First World citizens) the author reveals that at age 50 (FIFTY!) he and his wife decided to start having children;  wasteful, First World, resource-depleting children.  What an ass.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Let me start off by saying that Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise are good actors, and they both did a good job in this movie working together. This is probably the best movie I have seen Tom Cruise do in a long time. The movie is interesting enough to draw you in, and it manages to entertain. In the end though, to me it was just \\"ok\\" movie. I thought the taxi cab scenes where over done, by that I mean most of the movie is spent in the cab with Cruise talking to Foxx. To me, this got a little old. **Spoilers warning** I also thought some of the writing was poor in this movie. Starting with the beginning of the movie, You already know the girl his going to play a part in the end of the movie, and within the first 20 minutes of the movie, you will know how everything is going to go down in the final scene. To me it was predictable. Some more poor writing can be seen during the bridge sequence. No one grabs a brief case owned by a guy with a gun and throws it into traffic. You would get shot, besides this, what does Jamie Foxx do after throwing the brief case? Stands there! If you just threw a briefcase over a bridge that you stolen from a man with a gun. You would chuck it and run! Not stand their waiting for him while putting up you hands. Instead of running, he stands their and waits for cruise to catch up and draw his gun on him. I thought that was stupid. One other example of poor writing, that you see in a lot of action movies, is the ending. Here we have a whole movie with Tom Cruise shooting people with DEADLY accuracy.  He can take out select targets in a night club, hitting them sqaure on from a distance in a mob of moving people. However, when it comes to the final scene in the movie, he can't take out 2 people? What happened to Mr. dead shot? Anyway, it was a good / ok movie. It is worth a rental, but I wouldn't own it, or probably watch it again, but it wasn't bad either. I did like Cruise as a bad guy though.
B00003CWPL|1.0|With the rating system that is given on Amazon the least I could give this \\"movie\\" was 1 star but that is even to high a rating for this stinker. In a long boring line of pretentious directors with egos much larger than their talents, David Lynch is at least number three on the \\"chart\\". This movie has almost no dialogue, the \\"actors\\" were amateurish, and ugly.  Love the Art Garfunkle hair do. One part I thought was funny was when the old lady was smoking while making a salad and the ash was going into the bowl.   If you want something to make you fall asleep or vomit this one is for you!
1573229725|5.0|Firstly I will say that if you have seen the BBC version and were not impressed, don't let it put you off the book, the two can not compare.  I saw Tipping The Velvet and was hooked, I saw Fingersmith and well don't have much to say really... But I felt I should read the book (knowing what the BBC are like, if only film 4 or channel 4 got hold of it sooner!) and I have to say the book is amazing!!!!!!!<br /><br />What struck me first about this book is the number of times one can, and must read it.  Waters unique style of telling the same story twice, once from the perspective of Sue, and once from that of Maud means that the all-knowing reader agonises all the more as they understand how each action effects the other, they see the hidden messages in words and actions, each time understanding the effect on the other character. I found it agonising knowing so much and being forced to read on watching each character trap the other more furmly and deeply into the Gentlemans plot purely because they loved one another so truly.<br /><br />Waters intimate love scenes are not lengthy, really few and far between, howver this mearly acts to make each moment they share has all the more meaning, the touch of a hand, or the russtle of a skirt becomes a sexually charged explision of want and desire.  The desire one girl has for the other fluctuates depending on their beliefes or dibeliefs in the plot, Gentleman and each other. Through Waters narritive we see how an innocent move by one causes the other to flush and fall ever more in love, often with the executor of the action unaware.  Then occasionally both become mesmorized at the same time, it is at these points the reader can really relate to the characters, bringing into the plot their own experiences and feeling, and so adding a new depth to each character, and a greater wish for the charsis a happy ending should provide.<br /><br />I found the tugg of this need all too great, and must admit to reading the last few pages well before I was half way through the book.  Sometimes this can ruin the book but in this case it only made things better, knowing what should come I was less on edge when reading and found the book more enjoyable, I took the time to read it carefully and soak up the fantastic literly syle of all Waters work were before I was reading at such a speed I'm sure I managed to pass at least three of the pages.  The story has so many twists and excuisit moments that you could be told in detail the entire story and still enjoy reading it and discovering all the little details that an overview would miss out on.<br /><br />I myself will enjoy reading it again, to look more intimatly into the wording to find the little clues and details I looked over in the first reading of it.

0563214546|5.0|Delia is as much a household name in Britain as Julia Child is in the U.S.  These recipes will very much dispense with any myths about British food being tasteless and mainly boiled.  Delia always graced my mother's cookbook shelf, and now years on I have my own greasy dog-eared copy that has become my kitchen bible.  If you want an amazing desert that is simple to make, striking in presentation, and delicious to eat DO TRY the profiteroles recipe, and Pavlova Meringue.  <br /> <br />Her instructions for making a proper roast dinner with crisp roast potatoes and yorkshire pudding are also flawless (although I like to do my puds in muffin tins instead:)) <br />Leek and potato soup, italian baked fish, risotto, potatoes lyonaisse, marinated mushrooms... I could go on and on.  Each recipe simple to follow, basic ingredients, european flair with minimum of fuss and delicious results.   <br />Long live Delia! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006879E|2.0|Some of my friends recommended this group so I thought I'd give <br />them a listen. What I found was a rather tedious effort by rank <br />amateurs. The material is copied from others before them. I detected a number of wrong harmonies, chords that didn't fit with <br />the melodic lines sung. There were also a number of false starts <br />which should have been edited out. Maybe they were given free studio time on the engineers night off! I did find one positive <br />aspect of this group which is the drummer. He is very good and the only energy in the group. What is he doing with the other four is a question only he can answer!
B000003TAR|5.0|Well Nirvna has givin everyone GREAT music to perish forever and this is on their last but not least album. which as someone said that yes it is depressing to listen to to this....not because its bad but if you listen to it, and think.\\"wow this was Kurt Cobains last bow and this was the last time he got to share his music with us all. And to think that he did not know that and just died out of no place!and to think of his letter to all.....why did he do it? or is it possible he was murderd? who knows but i think that all should get this album and hold on to it and think of all these thoughts.....
B0007OCG56|5.0|I watched this movie expecting a sweet boy meets girl romantic comedy, but I was delighted to find it to be far richer in its story and character elements than that.  The dialogue and the situations made all of the characters' actions and words seem at once endearing and maddening, much as a real family tends to be.  I think this movie deserves a lot of praise for creating a cohesive dynamic between the characters and for making the characters themselves thoroughly human and undeniably unique. <br /> <br />What I enjoyed most about this film as well as Brooks' previous movie As Good as it Gets, is that I find myself liking his characters both for their virtues and their flaws.  It makes me feel better about people in general, and that is an unusual feeling for me to get from a movie.  Brooks tackles vice in a way that enriches the warmth and intimacy of a story, and in so doing yields a kind of optimism about humanity and all its attendant drama.  I find that inspiring. <br /> <br />I admit this movie is not for everyone.  Some people prefer less convoluted dialogue and clearer messages and storytelling.  If you're looking for a light laugh and a quick tale, you may wish to avoid this film.  However, if you're looking for something with a great sense of balance and character development, look no further.
B00005JMAH|4.0|(This isn't Joseph.) I am an extreme Harry Potter fan (i've read each of the books at least 3 or 4 times. The Goblet of fire: 7 times) and i believe that this movie was slightly disappointing. They left out the good parts of the movie such as the winning Quiddicth Cup Match with Slytherin, Sirius Black Breaking into the dormitory and frightening Ron, (part of this is shown on disc two), the part when Remus Lupin unfolds the story of his days at Hogwarts with Sirius, James, and Peter, the fact that Harry never found out about the relationship between his Patronus (a stag) and his father, the Maruader's Map wasn't finished telling off Severus Snape when he found it that day, and last, the movie didn't tell why Snape didn't like Harry's father. <br /> <br />Also, a part in the movie was out of order (when Harry received the Firebolt), others said lines that didn't belong to them (when Sirius says \\"the ones that love us never really leave us,\\". That's Dumbledore's line), and Peter Pettigrew's description didn't match the book's description (ture it said in one of the earlier chapters that he was \\"a little lump of a boy,\\" but later it says that he looks like a man who lost a lot of weight in a short time, meaning that he should have been skinny. <br /> <br />Personally, i believe that Chris Columbus should have directed this movie. Even though he did lend a hand, i think the missing parts would have been filled if he had directed it. <br /> <br />The movie was still good, but, if you are expecting it to be just like the book, you may be a little disappointed.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|I just watched this DVD and I was appalled at the men I used to revere as my musical heroes.  At every turn they seemed vain, childish, self-centered, and invariably spoiled by their success.  As a reviewer before me put it, Lars, James, and Kirk have lost touch with reality.  Worse still is having to sit through their pointless rationalizations for their juvenile posturings while cobbling together the worst material they've yet written for an album.  The film alternates from lame psycho-babble and disingenuous shows of affection or anger to scenes of a burned-out group of musical hacks slogging away in laughable attempts at musical \\"experimentation.\\"  ...Only, Metallica's new direction has less to do with expanding their musical boundaries than it does with their pure laziness.  They've gotten too lazy after the Black album, which in and of itself was a let down from their previous efforts.  They put a ton of work into their older material, and I think they pussed out since then.  Their old material truly was experimental for its time.  The stuff now is just thoughtless in comparison.<br /><br />But, I digress.  This review is really about what an utter waste of time this movie is.<br /><br />The only highlights were the interviews with Newsted and Dave Mustaine, the two people who've suffered most at the hands of Metallica's twin jerks, Lars and James.  Kirk didn't seem so nuts, and I appreciated some of the stuff he had to say.  His segments in the film were a refreshing change of pace from the melodrama between his bandmates.<br /><br />I have a lot of sympathy for the poor schmucks dealing with Lars and James.  That poor therapist was working with men who had the emotional capacity of 9-year-olds!  Heaven help him!  ...And it's too bad about Trujillo.  I think he's a great bass player with a lot of energy, and I hate to see it wasted on a sinking ship...Metallica that is.<br /><br />This film is a joke, and a self-serving one at that.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Whenever there are almost 800 reviews or more to a film, it's difficult to add anything different to the forum.  It is especially difficult when many of the reviews give away important plot details, which I avoid since I believe in letting the viewer make up his or her own mind.<br /><br />_RfaD_  tells of four people, who will all be conquered by addiction, living in the Brighton Beach section of New York City.  There's Harry Goldfarb (played by Jared Leto), a rather unmotivated man in his late twenties who somehow gets by without a job or any prospects of finding one.  The opening scene involves Harry pawning his mother's television set.  There's Harry's friend Tyrone(played in a surprisingly fine dramatic performance by Marlon Wayans), who like Harry dreams of obtaining financial security without having to work hard for it.  There's Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), an aspiring artist who comes from a well-to-do but emotionally remote family.  And finally there's Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn delivering one of the most courageous performances ever captured on camera), a lonely and slightly obese widow who pines for the days when her husband was still alive.  _RfaD_ chronicles the addictions of these four people throughout three seasons: Summer, Fall, and Winter.<br /><br />What all four of these people have in common is that they all have dreams, none of which come true because of the addictions of these people.  Harry wants to make himself and everyone happy around him. He believes that by selling and using drugs, he can achieve that goal.  Tyrone seeks the happiness he knew as a child with his loving mother, and a lot of money on the side.  Marion is trying to find the love she feels she is not receiving from her own family.  And Sara believes she can \\"be somebody\\" by appearing on a self-help infomercial.  She tries to lose weight so she can once again wear a red dress that was symbolic of better times.  If there is a point to all this besides the obvious \\"just say no to drugs\\" message , it's that you can't live your dreams by living in Dreamland.<br /><br />As many reviewers stated previously, this is not easy viewing - nor is it meant to be.  When I rented this from my local Movie Gallery, I had to go back and rent Caddyshack to pick myself back up.  Anyhow, there are entirely too many out there who say this film delves into only worst case scenarios.  Hello!!!  Drug addiction, be it illegal or legal drugs, in itself is a worst case scenario.  Life is not a made-for-TV movie in which every one who is addicted kicks the habit before things get too far out of control.  If _RfaD_ had one fault, it was that it UNDERSTATED the dangers of addiction.  Yes, you read that correctly.  There are horrors from addiction worse than what we see in this film as hard as that is to believe.  Nonetheless, I strongly applaud director Darren Aronofsky and writer Hubert Selby Jr. (based on his novel by the way) for not sugarcoating anything.just say no to drugs\\" message , it's that you can't live your dreams by living in Dreamland.

B0007GAERG|5.0|It's amazing that you find many people jealous that Mariah Carey still has it after 15 years in the music business.  This record is classic R&B and it will most definitely be one of the biggest albums of 2005, both critically and commercially.   <br />Mariah's collaborations with the featured artists on this album do not detract from the songs at all, each collaborator brings their individual talents into the mix and kicks it up a notch.  This is talent at its best. <br /> <br />Maybe others who want to see Mariah fall flat on her face should look to none other than Ms. Jennifer Lopez, as this feat was accomplished by her no less than 2 months ago with the release of her commercially and critically panned album; \\"Rebirth.\\"  To even think for a second that Jennifer Lopez has a \\"prominent\\" voice is ludicrous....I think we all know who has the real voice here.  Heck, Whitney on crack sounds a whole lot better than Jennifer could ever hope to be.
B00018D44U|4.0|In \\"Feels Like Home\\" Norah Jones displays her incredible talent in writing, arranging, playing and singing songs that have a bluesy, country feel.  Some reviewers liked her first album better, mostly because it had less of a country sound.  But an artist has to experiment, explore and grow or else that artist will be impugned as repetitive and irrelevant.  The common thread in both albums is Norah Jones' exquisite voice, so airy and controlled.  The last song, \\"Don't Miss You At All\\" is alone worth the price of admission; it's so lovely.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah Carey's new CD is probably the best she's had since \\"Butterfly.\\" While both \\"Rainbow\\" and \\"Charmbracelet\\" had tracks I enjoyed, I was disappointed in both of them, but \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" does not disappoint. I wish she had covered a song though. It seems in most of her albums she has one track that's a cover. I would love for her to cover \\"Just Be Good To Me.\\" I've heard her sing it live and she does it awesomely.  <br /> <br />IT'S LIKE THAT: Like most of Mariah's albums, she starts out with a fast-paced track that is catchy. (See Dream Lover, Emotions, Heartbreaker, Fantasy, Honey). It's got a funky beat to it and is a fun listen.  <br /> <br />WE BELONG TOGETHER: Right now, it's my favorite track on the cd. Mariah's voice is like honey, pardon the clich. I love the flow of the song. Great choice by making it an early single. The reason I got this cd was because I was a Mariah fan, but even if I had never owned any of her albums, I probably would have bought this album just from hearing this song being sung on GMA and Letterman.  <br /> <br />SHAKE IT OFF: Not really one of my favorite songs from the albums, but maybe I would appreciate it more if I knew what a Calgon commercial was. ::shrug::: <br /> <br />MINE AGAIN: Shades of early `90s Mariah appears in this song. A nice ballad with strong vocals. <br /> <br />SAY SOMETHING: I really love this song. It has a fun, catchy vibe to it and Snoop Dogg works well in it.  <br /> <br />STAY THE NIGHT: I'm pretty neutral about this song. I don't love it, but I don't dislike it either. To me, it's just one of those filler songs, but I think it could grow on me. Again, Mariah shows us her awesome vocals on this track. <br /> <br />GET YOUR NUMBER: The lyrics are kind of stupid and the chorus is very repetitive, but the beat is definitely catchy.  <br /> <br />ONE AND ONLY: Usually I hate it when rappers make a cameo in songs unless it works, and in this song it works with Twista providing the rap portion.<br /> <br />CIRCLES: Another old school Mariah found in this song. Love it. Kinda reminds me of \\"Underneath the Stars,\\" \\"Fourth of July.\\" <br /> <br />YOUR GIRL: Another great song, what can I say? I love the sound of the chorus. <br /> <br />I WISH YOU KNEW: I love the live feeling of the song. The song is a little bit boring, but I like it when she talks. <br /> <br />TO THE FLOOR: Can't get really into this song, not one of my favorites. <br /> <br />JOY RIDE: Nice little ballad, sounds like something that was leftover from the \\"Daydream\\" album, almost. It's okay, but nothing to get excited over. <br /> <br />FLY LIKE A BIRD: Great finale for the album. Lovely lyrics. Strong vocals. Love the choir. <br />
B00006AFUR|5.0|After hearing the song Capricorn (A Brand New Name) a few years ago, I instantly had to hear more. I bought the CD and my musical taste was rocked! There simply arn't any bands even similar to Jared and the rest of the guys. They turn up the raw intensity that fuels their amazing sound. I highly advise checking out their website at anytime. It is constantly being updated and they have a brand new CD coming out on Aug 16/05 titled A Beautiful Lie. Take it from me this new CD is going to blow you away. Enjoy!
B0002IVN9W|4.0|this album is without a doubt a powerful listening experience... i just don't believe it's quite as fully realized as it could be... i give it a 3 1/2... don't get me wrong, this band has the potential to make some even more powerful music in the future, and most likely a masterpiece... the fact that this is their debut album is definitely a testament to the strength of this band... <br /> <br />the record is cathartc & emotional...the structure of the music is akin to Berlin Era David Bowie- very tense, very jagged... the vocalist sounds a lot like a Scott Walker/Bowie/Byrne, with those theatrical vocals...deep, emotional vocals... <br /> <br />the lyrics are of course peversley depressing at times...but in a good way... it's refreshing to hear something different, and of all things, something down to earth... <br /> <br />string instruments are used to great effect... the instruments in general all pulsate and mesh in a really nice mix of post-punkish throwback...especially beautiful on the understated gem , \\"Haiti\\"...(where the female vocalist takes a nice stab at it) just beautiful music... <br /> <br />anyway,  <br /> <br />recommended. <br /> <br />if you're a fan of Roxy Music, Berlin Bowie, Scott Walker, Talking Heads, Pixies, or Joy Division (probably the prime influences of this record) you'll instantly love this...BUT, this is not just some throwback band copying from peers, this is a highly individual statement, and just uses certain elements from the afformentioned, not just a carbon copy (like maybe say Interpol)... <br /> <br />not a masterpiece... more of a stepping stone for a band that looks to have one of the most creative futures in music today... can't wait to hear what these kids'll do next... let's hope that the attention doesn't get to their heads...
B000000NN4|4.0|On this album, \\"Alpha\\" is the main theme song for the docu-drama \\"Death of a Princess\\" about a Saudi Royal Princess and this song was also part of Carl Sagan's Cosmos television series. This song alone is worth the purchase of the album
B00063MBU8|5.0|This cd is great! There is not one song on the cd that isn't good or not worth listening to. Every song is different from the next and all have there own unique meaning. This is one of the best cd's that I have heard in awhile and Simple Plan should keep up the excellent work!
B0000A0DRY|5.0|\\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" was Jefferson Airplane's second album, and the first to feature Grace Slick. Slick brought to the band two outstanding songs from her earlier carreer, \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit!\\". These two songs along with \\"My Best Friend\\", \\"DCBA-25\\", \\"How Do You Feel\\" and \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\" make it the most consistent J.A. album, and in my opinion the one that has aged the best.<br /><br />Some later J.A. albums like \\"Volunteers\\" somehow suffer from sounding like the band was taking themselves too seriously at the time. Most songs are catchy pop/rock tunes; still with room for musical experiments, indicating that this was a band that did not want to stay within the limited frame of doing 2-3 minute pop songs.<br /><br />It's one of the few J.A. albums ( if not the only one ) where all tracks are still worthwhile listening to here almost 4 decades later.<br /><br />The songs are written by all band-members (except Cassidy) in various combinations with lead singer Marty Balin as the main contributor.<br /><br />Among the fine bonus tracks Skip Spece's \\"J.P.P. McStep B. Blues\\" was the biggest positive surprise for me; like \\"My Best Friend\\" almost folk-music.
B0002KP5FI|3.0|Despite being a Nicola Conte's fan I think that his new album for Blue Note is a pretentious attempt to switch from the fresh sound of the previous albums to a boring excercise of re-reading the glorious sound of the jazz of the fifties and sixties. It doesn't sound new and fresh at all (apart from Kind of sunshine very much in the St.Germain style). <br />What saves this album is the quality of the musicians that took part to it and the fact that the tracks that originally inspired Nicola Conte's ones are so good that any copy can't be that bad. But next time I expect a change of direction...again.
0316172324|2.0|It basically took two simple ideas (your first reaction is often the decision you'll ultimately reach anyway which is fine until your subconscious and gut reaction leads to a serious consequence)that contradict each other , devotes 100 pages towards trying to justify each of the thoughts, and never ties the points together.  A real disappointment.
0805076476|5.0|Me, I just finished reading Fight Club.  Redemption for a life of suffering, you say.  Outrageous, twisted redemption.  Perverse redemption for a dull, futureless existence of grinding routine and mindless devotion to material gain.  I am the reviewer's impressed opinion.  I am the reviewer's enthusiastic recommendation. <br /> <br />    Fight Club is not for everybody, obviously.  For one thing, anyone who shops at Cracker Barrel and believes social security will be there when they retire will  have no tolerance for the harsh bitch-slap of cynicism it delivers, nor will they find anything funny about it.  But Fight Club is funny in the grand tradition of absurdist literature, here taken to a mind-boggling, socially disaffected, post-punk extreme.  Moreover, it delivers a marvelous sucker punch of a surprise that will leave you reeling if you haven't made the mistake of seeing the movie first. <br /> <br />     Fight Club tells the story of the nameless narrator's relationship with a charismatic anarchist named Tyler Durden who quickly taps into the morose, alienated psyche of the insomnia afflicted narrator and signs him on for all manner of ostensibly soul cleansing mayhem, including, but not limited to, a club that meets each Thursday night to, you guessed it, fight.  As you can probably figure out, this is not the kind of fighting that involves boxing gloves and the Marquis of Queensbury rules.  This is fighting as guided masochism, meant to punish and disfigure and awaken the subject to the preciousness of life and the nearness of death, and it is perhaps the least of the scary and violent pastimes Tyler Durden gets the narrator belted into! <br /> <br />     Before long the reader finds himself careering through a macabre fun house of anarchic activities that, predictably, spin out of control, although not in the way you might think.  Soon the narrator is forced to come to terms with the monster he has become and when he starts fighting back, the fun really starts. <br /> <br />     Chuck Palahniuk has a unique writing style.  Sentence structure, the way you normally think of it, chopped up.  Reflective pauses.  The structure, as a subject, perhaps, revisited, although you can pick any subject.   Meant to mimic a confused, desperate mind.  And then a pay off in a single word. <br /> <br />    Unhinged. <br /> <br />    It's a style, for all its convolutions, that's remarkably easy to get into, and the book is a quick, sharp read (only 200 pages) delivered like a blow to the solar plexus.  <br />  <br />     If I have any complaints, it's the by now clichd attempt by Gen X authors to raise sulkiness to high art.  I get it, already, you guys were screwed, life sucks.  Next. <br /> <br />     But it is perhaps unfair to put Palahniuk down for this, as Fight Club was originally published in 1996 and might justifiably be reckoned an archetype of raw, disgruntled, in-your-face, post-punk fiction.  I would not take it to a desert island with me, as I prefer a little sugar with my diet of roots and grubs, but as an exemplar of late-nineties absurdist fiction it knocks the competition flat.
B00080ZG10|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this film.  It just jumps into the story... The first 30 seconds aside, by the time the story begins, Hughes is grown up, rich and already a basket case.  The movie kinda takes that for granted...  I guess if it were a true biography his formative years would have been more revealing, but heck, its a Holywood film, not a documentary, so Scorcese goes right to the planes and the sex.  - - DeCaprio definitely holds the film together however... Allen Alda is great too...  Katherine Hepburn is difficult...  the impression was so good it seemed to me comedic at times (Hey, she did have a funny voice...)... but to me the film has the feel of an \\"incomplete\\" epoc masterpiece, the way it jumps in and out of the story... I think the film lacks is emotion and completeness (Although there are a few edge of your seat fans, don't expect to be bedazzled like Titanic or whatever... and don't expect and completely film revolutionizing dramatic scenes.) - -  however, the area where it does make up for things is the way it inspires... You come to admire the Chutzpah of a guy who comes up with the wildest of ideas... then having all the genius and money in the world makes those dreams come true...  (Hughes, not Scorcese, though Scorcese is obviously a genius as well.) - - aside from that, with the exception of those Dicaprio fans thrilled to glimpse his rectal lobes I'd say its a fun and entertaining film, but I doubt it'll go down in history as Hollywood History... seemed more like an HBO movie special type thing...
0385510454|5.0|After a 2 or 3 year period, I have once again started to like reading Grisham's works, and with The Broker, I have to say that he is on top of the game once again.  Rather than the lawyer story line that we are used to reading from Grisham we get an interesting plot with stolen satellite surveillance software, a federal prisoner freed so the US can try to figure out who kills him, and some twists that make you want to keep reading.    Joel Blackman is released from prison on a Presidential pardon and he has no idea why he was released.  All he knows his he is moved to Italy where most of the story takes place.  The middle of the book takes you on a little tour of Italy while Joel gets lessons in Italian from two instructors.  It is well written and interesting as Grisham keeps the story moving even through these lessons.      There is of course the twists at the end that will keep everyone guessing.  Grisham makes Joel Blackman into a real person that allows you to understand his motives and his actions.  One of the top 3 Grisham books yet, and hopefully the international espionage theme might continue in future books.  I would highly recommend this book to all!!
B00005JNNZ|3.0|Coach Carter is a MTV feature film production. This film stars Samuel L. Jackson, and tells the true story of Coach Ken Carter from Richmond High School in inner city Los Angeles, California. <br /> <br />Carter is a self-made man, a strict disciplinarian, and owner of his own Sporting Goods Store. As the film begins, Carter has returned to old alma mater to watch a basketball game against St. Joseph, the High School his son is attending. Prior to game, Coach Carter has already been approached by the school's current coach to take over the team. <br /> <br />Richmond is severely thrashed, their undisciplined, their cocky, and unruly. Carter accepts the coaching position; however, it has to be on his terms. Richmond had only won 4 total games the previously year, so Coach Carter was afforded his request. <br /> <br />Carter required all of his players to sign a contract before any of them could play ball. The contract required each player to maintain a 2.3 G.P.A., attend all scheduled classes, and to sit in the front row of all classes in which they attended. He required Progress Reports for all teachers documenting each player's academics. He also required each player to dress appropriately on Game Day, with Tie and Coat; this promoted respect in the team, and respect for oneself. <br /> <br />Prior to the season's start, no one even knew who or where Richmond High School was, but rigorous practices, forced discipline, and strict guidance from carter turned them into winners; however, that's where the trouble started. <br /> <br />Winning was easy, Carter had a plan; and the team executed it superbly. However, Carter wanted more for these players; he wanted hope, desire, and the ability to lift themselves above the life in which they were headed. He wanted his players to have the ability to attended college; and this could only happen if their grades were good enough. <br /> <br />However, Richmond H.S. only graduates 33% of their seniors and over 60% of those are female. Carter explained that his player stood a better chance going to Jail than college. Once the Progress Reports were published, six of his players were failing at least one or more of their classes. So Carter at 16-0, undefeated and headed to the state championships, locked the gym doors and started forfeiting games; turning basketball practice sessions into tutoring lessons for the players. This is when the sh@# hit the proverbial fan..... <br /> <br />In the semblance of Stand and Deliver, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers, Coach Carter is another story about one man against insurmountable odds, bound and determined to make a difference in someone else's life, even if that someone isn't seeking change (well, at first anyways). In doing so, he changes that person today, and for generations to come. Coach Carter is raw at times, and might not be as good as other that I've mention; however, it's a story well told, and I did enjoy it. <br /> <br />[...]
B00005OM4N|4.0|With her first two albums Britney Spears proved to everyone that throne of Madonna - The Queen Of Pop is in serious danger. And now with her third album simply entitled \\"Britney\\" it seems she can also take away the crown from Janet Jackson - The Queen Of R'n'B. After listening to this album I think it's a question of time.     This album is a bridge between Spears' pop past and her r'n'b future because besides up-tempo pop songs written and produced by Max Martin, who is responsible for huge success of her previous albums which made her the biggest pop star on Earth, above all it surprises with completely brand new r'n'b sound. All because Britney's new producers Rodney Jerkins and The Neptunes showed her a new way of searches in music and wrote for her almost half of all songs on this album. It caused very successful metamorphosis of her music. Such big pop artists like Justin Timberlake and Dido also wrote some material. And even Spears co-wrote five songs.     All this album is very catchy and even its bonus tracks and b-sides are among the most marvellous things Spears ever did (especially astonishing \\"Before The Goodbye\\" and \\"I Run Away\\" available only on the expanded editions). The best song on this version is \\"Cinderella\\" - brilliant up-tempo track and definitely one of her best ever. Other great songs are such r'n'b jewels like: \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", \\"Lonely\\", \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" or \\"Let Me Be\\" and such pop pearls like: \\"Bombastic Love\\", \\"Overprotected\\" and beautiful ballad \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\".     Unfortunately this is a standard US version of this album with only 12 songs. It's better to buy one of its expanded editions. You can choose either version with 15 songs (with all 3 brilliant Japanese bonus tracks) or special edition with 2 from 3 Japanese bonus tracks, 3 very good remixes of album's best hits and DVD with her 3 videos, interview and Pepsi's commercial (but either with ballad \\"I Run Away\\" or with dance masterpiece \\"Before The Goodbye\\").     Every fan of Spears, Madonna or especially Janet Jackson must have this album. Like always, it's full of great songs and so fresh production. So choose your edition and enjoy!
B0002X314C|3.0|Anyone heard any new singles from Kanye West lately? That's probably because he's spending his free moments working with his new protg John Legend. It may have seemed like Legend came out of thin air, but he has been working towards this moment for years, polishing his piano skills since early childhood. He has also made a name for himself by lending his talents to artists such as Twista (\\"Overnight Celebrity\\"), Janet Jackson (\\"I Want You\\"), Alicia Keys (\\"You Don't Know My Name\\"), and many more. John is finally ready for the big time, releasing his own album with production assistance from long-time mentor Kanye. <br /> <br />The album begins with Legend gracefully stroking the keys and crooning a heartfelt introduction to the album in the premier song \\"Let's Get Lifted.\\" Throughout the album, he mainly sticks with his R&B roots, but branches out as much as he can inside of those restrictions. On such tracks as \\"Used to Love U\\" and \\"Number One,\\" listeners get a chance to hear Legend's use of piano and vocal skill soar over the top of some soulful backgrounds produced by West. \\"Alright\\" seems to be what Tweet was trying to achieve with her song \\"Call Me\\" while \\"She Don't Have to Know\\" proves early on in the album that Legend can produce a great song without the watchful eye of West. After an appearance from Snoop Dogg on \\"I Can Change,\\" the album dramatically slows down and features its star stroking the keys with little distraction. <br /> <br />The lyrics of Get Lifted are also worth a mention. Unlike today's popular hip-hop and R&B which consist mainly of tales of people falling in love, fondling women, and/or how one can waste their money, Legend speaks of so much more. In his song \\"She Don't Have to Know,\\" the lyrics tell of what happens when one takes an interest in someone that is already taken, while \\"Refuge\\" talks about finding comfort with loved ones. \\"Ordinary People\\" and \\"Stay with You\\" seem more like songs one would hear from one amazing Baptist pianist performing secular music. Overall, \\"Stay with You,\\" \\"Let's Get Lifted Again,\\" \\"So High,\\" and \\"Refuge (When It's Cold Outside)\\" are rather forgettable, bu the track that follows \\"It Don't Have to Change\\" really contrasts those previously mentioned songs with Legend's piano and entire family backing him, stating, \\"Times is hard and things are a-changing/ I pray to God that things can remain the same/ All I'm tryin to say is our love don't have to change.\\" Then, Legend gives listeners one last surprise as he switches gears once again on the album's final track \\"Live It Up\\" featuring some `90s bass and hip-hop's newest violinist Miri Ben-Ari (most noteworthy for her appearance in Twista's \\"Overnight Celebrity\\"). <br /> <br />Overall, Get Lifted takes one back to the soulful and poignant days of Motown, yet still remains current with production from West. It seems as though Legend's intent of the words \\"get lifted\\" isn't physical or emotional, or even spiritual, but rather a culmination of the three giving listeners the soul found in \\"church\\" and mixing it with the vibe of today's hip-hop. Legend's style may be a bit old-fashioned, but it's something unheard of in today's pop music and is definitely worth a listen.
B00009YNGA|5.0|With her first two albums Britney Spears proved to everyone that throne of Madonna - The Queen Of Pop is in serious danger. And now with her third album simply entitled \\"Britney\\" it seems she can also take away the crown from Janet Jackson - The Queen Of R'n'B. After listening to this album I think it's a question of time.  <br /> <br />This is expanded, the best edition of this album, because besides all 12 songs from its standard version it contains all 3 brilliant bonus tracks from its Japanese edition.  <br /> <br />This album is a bridge between Spears' pop past and her r'n'b future because besides up-tempo pop songs written and produced by Max Martin, who is responsible for huge success of her previous albums which made her the biggest pop star on Earth, above all it surprises with completely brand new r'n'b sound. All because Britney's new producers Rodney Jerkins and The Neptunes showed her a new way of searches in music and wrote for her almost half of all songs on this album. It caused very successful metamorphosis of her music. Such big pop artists like Justin Timberlake and Dido also wrote some material. And even Spears co-wrote five songs.  <br /> <br />All this album is very catchy and even its bonus tracks and b-sides are among the most marvellous things Spears ever did. Especially astonishing \\"Before The Goodbye\\" and \\"I Run Away\\", which along with \\"Cinderella\\" are definitely some of her best tunes ever. Other great songs are such r'n'b jewels like: \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", \\"Lonely\\", \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" or \\"Let Me Be\\" and such pop pearls like: \\"Bombastic Love\\", \\"Overprotected\\" and beautiful ballad \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\".  <br /> <br />There is also expanded edition of this album, which besides all 12 songs from its standard version contains only 2 from 3 Japanese bonus tracks, but also 3 very good remixes of album's biggest hits and DVD with her 3 videos, interview and Pepsi's commercial.  <br /> <br />Every fan of Spears, Madonna or especially Janet Jackson must have this album. Like always, it's full of great songs and so fresh production. This time you can choose either this edition with 15 songs (without DVD and remixes but with all Japanese bonus tracks) or that with DVD (but either with ballad \\"I Run Away\\" or with dance masterpiece \\"Before The Goodbye\\"). So choose your edition and enjoy!  <br />
B0002XDODU|5.0|This is personally one of my favorite Rammstein CD's.  From the sweeping ballads of Ohne Dich (Without You) and Amour (Love) to the  headbanging inducing Mein Teil (My Part/Tool) and Moskau, Rammstein takes you on a tour de force of its lyrical and musical prowess.  This album features deeper lyrics and more creative musical sounds, such as an acordian in the title track Reise, Reise (Arise, Arise) and choirs in Mein Teil and Morgenstern (Morning Star).  Full of dark humor and satire.  Till Lindemann's vocals add weight and sencerity to the music and he keeps sounding better and better.  Definitly a must have for any Rammstein fan! <br />
B000002JR8|5.0|People who don't like this album are obviously fans of Cowboys From Hell and Vulgar Display Of Power.  It seems the consensus among the people who dislike this CD is that Dimebag's solos are cut down drastically and there are more power chords and heavy riffs in place of guitar solos.  Well, it is true that the guitar solos are less in number then the two previous CD's, and even the two CDs after this one.  But, its not just the solos that hold Pantera songs together.  Its the brutalness and the vocals and drums as well.  Listen to Use Your Third Arm for an example of how brutal Pantera can be. <br /> <br />When you listen to Vulgar Display Of Power, you can hear a drastic change from Cowboys From Hell to Vulgar Display... but, its a good change.  More heavy and more melodic.  And as you switch from VDOP to Far Beyond Driven, you can also see another change.  The signature Dimebag riff, with the distortion kicked up to the highest notch and Vinnie with his double bass drums, and of course, Phil with his gutteral scream are all in this album. <br /> <br />I would say the first half of the CD is all their more known hits, and the second half is all heavier and more brutal songs, with the exception of Planet Caravan, which is a beautifal rendidion of Black Sabbath's song. <br /> <br />My favorite track on the CD is probably 5 Minutes Along.  Clocking in at just about 5 minutes (how ironic), this song starts off like any other Pantera song, and then just gets heavier and heavier until you get to the amazing Dimebag solo.  The end is just a brutal mash of guitar, drums and Phil screaming \\"5 MINUTES ALONE!!!!\\".   <br /> <br />1. Strength Beyond Strength - The first track on the album is also the fastest.  Phil just spits out the lyrics fast enough to make a rapper bow his head in respect.  And the lyrics are quite interesting as well.  The solo in this song uses an odd effect... very eerie... <br /> <br />2. Becoming - Another fast track that is more of a standout track for Vinnie.  At the end of this song, Vinnie's ridiculously fast drumming makes you want to go out and buy a drumset. <br /> <br />3. 5 Minutes Alone - As I said before, my favorite track on the album <br /> <br />4. I'm Broken - An amazing track, probably one of their biggest hits off of the CD.  Phil does some awesome screaming in this, and Dimebag plays a soaring solo. <br /> <br />5. Good Friend And A Bottle Of Pills - Probably one of my least favorites on it, but Rex's bass really stands out on this.  Dimebag's guitar sounds more like feedback from the amp, and Phils voice is simply a low growl as he reads off the lyrics. <br /> <br />6. Hard Line, Sunken Cheeks - I believe this is the longest song on the album.  A very good song, nevertheless... Not one of my favorites, but the solo in the middle makes up for it. <br /> <br />7. Slaughtered - A very catchy song, the beginning of a five heavy song stretch.... I love Phils deep scream and roar, and it really is showcased on this song, when he screams, \\"SLAUGHTERED!\\" I was pretty amazed at how heavy the song got right at the end, it made me literally want to get up and mosh with myself. Yes, I would say the heaviest song on the CD. <br /> <br />8. 25 Years - A slower song, but still nevertheless HEAVY!!  I love the beginning riff, its melodic and smooth, and very, VERy catchy.  After about thirty seconds, Rex's bass skills are really showcased.  The guitar gets a little odd, but still its a good song. <br /> <br />9. Shedding Skin - Heavy, heavy, heavy.... This song is basically a showcase of what the next two songs are going to be like.   <br /> <br />10. Use My Third Arm - The first time my ears happened upon this song, I was blown away by the sheer brutality.  The sound of Dimebag's heavy as hell power chords and Phils scream entering your ears are like smacks to the face.  Its just pure heavy. <br /> <br />11. Throes Of Rejection - The heavy songs just keep on coming.  Not my favorite song on the CD, but stillpretty good. <br /> <br />12. Planet Caravan - What a great finale to a GREAT album.  Compared to the five songs before it, this song is one that will make you swoon and sway back and forth.  Very soft, and Dimebag's  solo at the end is worth the CD price. <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, this is one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time.  I've seen people who listen to Throwdown and Hatebreed, saying that music is about the message... that it's better to listen to a band because of the words they spew out of their mouths, not because of the melody or the instrumental arrangements.  Well, I've got news for you.  Pantera is the band that GAVE influence to bands like Throwdown.  Just listen to the singers voice.  A total ripoff of Anselmo himself.  And the breakdowns, you say?  Throwdown is known for their BREAKDOWNS.  WEll, Pantera can make you want to run to the nearest public area, grab a person, and mosh, WITHOUT any breakdowns.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Wow were to begin... <br /> <br />The Movie <br /> <br />I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 in theaters. I thought it was a well organized, focused, and crafted docu-movie maybe not 100% accurate but is worth seeing more than once. I recently bought the DVD and sat down with a friend and watched it together. After words were exchanged (we live in a red state) he wanted to see one of the Anti-Kerry or Anti-Moore films. The only trouble was we couldn't find Celsius 41.11 or FahrenHYPE 9/11. We here and there WE even WENT to WAL-MART!!!! Movies I had clearly seen in stores before the Election in November. Puzzled we went to there websites. (to be honest there websites looked more like fancy pop-ups then authentic movie sites.) In short we never saw them. Fahrenheit 9/11 was chosen out of 21 million people as the best film of 2004. IT BEAT SPIDERMAN 2!!!! And I'm not surprised. And after Moore's Attack on President Bush and the Media for there bias views on everything Bush puts out. There has been a slight change now CNN isn't afraid to point out our (embarrassing) illegal immigrant problems. <br /> <br />The War.  <br /> <br />Iraq was no threat to the U.S. (at all) I do think that Saddam was a Terrorist. But, still no real threat. Hell we thought he was Funny! The Hot Shots Movies, the South Movie, Family Guy, and the List just goes on.     <br />  <br /> <br />

0393327655|5.0|This is an excellent book, but only if you already approve of the author's views on religion. However, I think it will have no effect whatsoever on believers in the supernatural, and judging by what we see around the world, their numbers are increasing...<br />I, for one, did not need this or any other similar book to lose my faith in the religion I was indoctrinated in when I was a kid.All I needed was a critical reading of the Bible, and all its contradictions appeared to me as a proof that this \\"sacred book\\" was not written under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, as I was led to believe...From there, it was very easy to lose faith in the Holy Spirit and its two companions of the Trinity!But could you possibly tell that to a Christian believer?Take, for instance, the story of the virgin conception of Jesus. According to the gospel of Matthew, this came as a fulfillment of a prophecy, found in chapter 7 of Isaiah. Now, very few Christians I questioned know anything about this prophecy: all they know is what Matthew claims it to be, namely that \\"the virgin will conceive and will give birth to a child, who will be named Emmanuel, which means God with us\\"...As pointed out by Sam Harris, the whole chapter 7 of Isaiah  turns around a feud between Ahaz, king of Judea, and his neighbors, the kings of Israël and Syria, and has \\"as much relevance to Jesus and his mother as it has to me and my mother\\", in the words of Thomas Payne. But there is something more, that Sam Harris did not mention: the word \\"virgin\\" does not appear in the Hebrew version of the Bible, but it came from a mistranslation in the Greek Septuagint version. The original word is \\"almah\\", i.e. \\"young woman\\", and for a young woman to conceive no miracles are needed. And Isaiah himself says it clearly:\\"I approached the prophetess, and she conceived..\\" Now the whole dogma of the virgin birth is built on a mistranslation followed by a misinterpretation of a chapter written more than seven centuries before the alleged birth of Jesus...<br />And my criticism of the Christian faith applies also to all the other religions, especially the so-called \\"heavenly\\" ones, the Jewish and the Muslim...But go and convince any Jewish believer that Jehovah, that most ridiculous of all deities, did not promise Palestine to Abraham and his seed!  Or try to convince any Muslim that the Koran is not a faithful reproduction of a similar book kept on stone tablets in heaven! And this despite the fact that all the fables therein are drawn from Jewish and Christian books, canonical or otherwise(the Koran draws heavily on apocryphal gospels with regards to Jesus).There are even some verses which come verbatim from pre-islamic poetry, like that of Umru-al-Qays, one of the authors of \\"mu-allaquat\\", which are beautiful poems that used to be hung(in Arabic, mu-allaq)on the Kaaba.<br />Of course, Sam Harris is also right to point out that faith is a prime source of violence in the modern world: for example, most of the \\"terrorism\\" coming from the Islamic movements is centered around the Palestinian problem, which would never have existed had it not been for the religious belief of the Jews in the \\"paradigm\\" of the \\"promised land\\".<br />Finally, it is my personal opinion that, with the current level of evolution of the human mind, there will be no \\"end of faith\\" in the foreseeable future.Faith will only end when mankind would stop being afraid of death, and do away with the ancient belief in an \\"immortal soul\\". Then all of us would live this life serenely and peacefully, and take as a motto this unbelievably clever epitaph that some of the Romans used to put on their graves: \\"non fui, fui, non sum, non curo\\", which means :\\"I was not, I was, I am no more, I don't care\\".ed birth of Jesus...

B0000524CY|5.0|So much has been written and parodied about \\"THE EXORCIST\\" that (for a while, at least) it had lost some of its initial bite. But when the unreleased director's cut hit the market, the years of jocular pokes and bad exploitation movies fell by the wayside in the face of this remarkable and absolutely terrifying (yet ultimately hopeful) film. So what is the big deal? True, it is based upon a real account of a young boy who was legitimately possessed by a demon according to the Catholic Church which gave permission to perform an exorcism resulting in such similar occurrences of supernatural and blasphemous phenomenon that is so meticulously portrayed in the movie. But in the film (which is taken from screenwriter/producer William Peter Blatty's best-selling novel) the role of the young boy has been switched to a young girl (the sweet and oh so young Linda Blair) who, after playing with a ouija board, develops a friendship with a spirit named \\"Captain Howdy\\" who turns out to be none other than the Devil himself. As the girl's behavior starts to change and become more violent and foul-mouthed, her mother (played by the always dependable Ellen Burstyn) becomes more and more desperate to understand what is wrong with her. The horror of little Regan's predicament comes to a head in two key scenes: one of which ends in death and the infamous \\"crab-walking\\" clip, and the other where the Devil has full control over Regan's body and uses a crucifix in a way that is still one of the most evil acts ever shown in a public theater. As a last resort to save her daughter, Regan's mother agrees to an exorcism, and (with the blessings of the Holy Church) Father Merrin (Von Sydow) and Father Karras (Jason Miller) are dispatched to do battle with the entity and expel it from the young girl's body. The epic final scenes are unbelievably nerve-jangling: nothing will prepare you for what occurs. But the problem I have (as a Christian) with the movie isn't the unremitting blasphemies of theDevil (he is, after all, the Devil and it is an accurate portrayal despite the in-your-face evil of such a depiction) or the fact that, in the end, the two priests are willing to do their job even at the cost of their own lives. The problem is in the so-called \\"transference\\" of the evil entity into the supposedly consecrated body of the priest. Any student of theology should know that this is an impossibility: a priest (even one who has just regained his faith) invoking the power of Christ, blessed by Holy Water, and empowered by the Holy Spirit would never be able to entice a demon to \\"come into him\\" or \\"take him on instead'. Such a proposition (even if it were so) could not be taken up by a demon simply because the priest's consecrated body would burn like electricity to the touch if a demon were to try and gain access. It is the one significant flaw whereby the Holy Water they splash on Regan's body burns yet the demon entering into a priest's consecrated/Holy Spirit-filled body does not. And this only to tack on a more \\"Hollywood\\" ending rather than sticking to the true story on which Blatty's novel is based that culminates in the salvation of the little boy and the glory of the priests who walk away triumphant and not dragged through a river of blood, death, and gore (available in the R Rated and Unrated version/121 Minutes or 132 Minutes).

B00006LJ6X|4.0|So, in the fall of 1973, a bunch of the guys in Chicago say, \\"We're gonna do a jazz album this time.  All jazz.\\"  And bassist Peter Cetera sighs, \\"Hoo, boy.....\\"  After a few sessions, producer James William Guercio complains, \\"I hate this.  It just isn't working.\\"  Well, Peter just happens to have a few tunes of his own.....and CHICAGO VII is the result.  The recent Rhino remaster and re-release has given me a chance to re-evaluate this classic, first out in 1974. <br /> <br />Jazz dominates the first half of the CD, with mixed results.  Woodwind-meister Walt Parazaider gets a rare writing credit (along with drummer Dan Seraphine) on \\"Prelude to Aire,\\" a mix of dissonant flute and other strange sounds that are more ecletic than melodic.  \\"Aire,\\" co-written by trombonist James Pankow, is a delight, however; an instumental flight of fancy with a chunky mid-section featuring guitarist Terry Kath out-Bensoning George Benson.  The follow-up, \\"Devil's Suite,\\" features a lot of Buddy Rich-like brushing and Parazaider's attempt to emulate Woody Herman on the sporano sax; the results aren't good listening. <br /> <br />Keyboardist Robert Lamm takes over the writing chores on the next few tunes.  A Zappa-like combination of Rhodes and moog, \\"Italian From New York\\" is interesting--once.  \\"Hank Panky\\" is an excuse for an extended Pankow trombone solo (\\"PANKY\\"--get it?), and it is excellent.  \\"Life Saver\\" starts out with the funkiest of grooves, but suddenly switches gears and winds up sounding like a bad St. Louis bar band's version of a Jack Teagarden out-take.  Lamm's vocals on this one (the first on the album) sound like he's singing through a toilet paper tube.  But Cetera follows with the excellent Latinish ballad \\"Happy Man,\\" and things stay really solid thereafter. <br /> <br />The first single, \\"(I've Been) Searchin' So Long,\\" a Pankow opus, is haunting and beautiful, featuring a great Kath solo over soaring horn lines at the fade-out.  It's gorgeously sung by Cetera.\\"Mongonucleosis,\\" also a Pankow tune, follows, its solid Latin beat and catchy melody supported by a busy rhythm arrangement.  Two Kath tunes follow (both without horns): the breezy \\"Song of the Evergreens\\" (sung by trumpter Lee Loughnane in his vocal debut), and the tour de force \\"Byblos,\\" a complex ballad with terrific vocals and acoustic noodling by the writer. <br /> <br />\\"Wishing You Were Here,\\" with the Beach Boys on backing vocals, is a classic Chicago ballad with effective vocals traded by Kath and Cetera (also the writer on this one); the horns make a cameo appearance at the end.  The brass is out front on \\"Call on Me,\\" Loughnane's debut as a writer (reportedly with Cetera's help, uncredited), and the result is an upbeat hit.  My favorite tune on the set is Lamm's \\"The Woman Don't Want to Love Me.\\"  Sung by Cetera, the tune features racing horns, Kath's best wah-wah work, and a funky reggae backbeat that makes it great listening over and over again.  The original closer, Lamm's \\"Skinny Boy,\\" is famously a lift from his ill-fated solo project earlier that year with brass added for this edition.  Lamm sings this one in a rough but stylish voice, and is ably supported by the visiting Pointer Sisters who brought their best harmonies with them. <br /> <br />This being a re-release, there is a bonus track: a hyped-up rehearsal version of \\"Byblos.\\"  The slower version eventually released was far superior. <br /> <br />The liner notes for this version of CHICAGO VII are well done, and there are a few good photos included, too.  The album sounds like it was recorded yesterday.  I miss, though, the embossed leather-like feel of the original LP, something not even attempted by the CD.  All in all, there's something for everyone (except metalheads) on this Chicago effort, and it's well worth the money.
B0002OERI0|5.0|The cover of AMERICAN IDIOT is a hand holding a bleeding heart... that is actually a grenade with a pin in it.  On the back of the CD, you see just the pin and the 13-song track list, implying that this album is an explosion from the heart.  The music DEFINITELY lives up to the imagery's promise.  Before buying AMERICAN IDIOT, I had previously considered Green Day capable of only an occasional, catchy, new-punk radio hit, benefitting from the early-90s revolution that made pop music louder and angrier.  Boy, was I wrong.  On a whim, having heard some of the songs on the radio, I picked up the CD while standing in line at a bookstore. I am glad I did...THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING!  I have read comparisons to The Who's 1973 youth-anthem epic, QUADROPHENIA, one of my all time favorites, and it's a good fit - AMERICAN IDIOT is a rallying cry for a new generation full of suburban restlessness and pent-up rage and a need to find its own path - there are subtle anti-war, anti-establishment, anti-parent themes throughout, tied in with lots of energy, paranoia, anger... and, finally, reflection.  From a musical standpoint, you have certain recurring musical themes that follow several major characters, and a blend of short thrashers, sing along anthems, and two (excellent) longer pieces (which are actually each 5 songs in one). The album starts off with the radio-friendly, up-tempo title track calling for a rejection of the spoon-fed patriotism we get from the constant media cycle.  What follows is the 5-part JESUS OF SUBURBIA which gets better with each listen - telling us that the image of perfect suburban life is a lie, and has nothing to offer an energetic generation looking for answers.  HOLIDAY is a smackdown of the poltical establishment and the rush to war and mock patriotism that requires everyone to agree with everything Washington does.  BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS is an infectious, standout track about loneliness and determination that got lots of radio play.  The trackthat follows, ARE WE WAITING, is the rallying cry of this album's intended audience - a generation impatient for independence and meaning in their lives that plays like an anthem.  This outstanding song gives way to the hyperspeed ST. JIMMY, which introduces one of the major characters from the album, the icon Jimmy who rejects society's conventions and blazes his own path - \\"the needle in the vein of the establishment.\\"  He is revered by others for his fierce independence, teaches kids to blame his parents, and ultimately commits suicide.  I can't tell if Green Day is actually ridiculing HIS contempt for society as ultimately meaningless, or if this is to be a real hero.  The St. Jimmy character reminds me of the Bell Boy from Quadrophenia who once was a rebel but eventually gets sucked into the machine.  NOVACAINE is a radio-friendly tune about, well, tuning out - the singer is guided by St. Jimmy to seek the solace of drugs, or something, to avoid life's harshness.  The uptempo SHE'S A REBEL introduces us to the other major character - a girl named Whatshernam - who I imagine is a goth rebel that the male wannabe rebels all lust for.  This same character seems to be the focus of EXTRAORDINARY GIRL, which leads into LETTERBOMB, a call to action in which we are promised that \\"it's not over until you're underground.\\"  What follows is an amazing tune, WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS, which addresses something as simple as the sad feeling at summer's end, and something as complicated as depressing, lifelong nostalgia for good times from yesteryear.  The song starts quiet (like GOOD RIDDANCE) but builds to a rage of begging for the ability to go back in time and enjoy those lost years.  HOMECOMING is the second multi-piece song and announces the suicide of St. Jimmy, the fears of being left alone, and ultimately, a hopefulness that banding together in rejection of our parents' or government's hypocrisy is, in itself, a sort of society that all the \\"rebels\\" can call home.  The album ends with the reflective WHATSHERNAME which suggests that, sometime in the future, the main character is thinking back to the years of energy and rage, wondering whatever happened to the people that defined those times.  Throughout the album, there is so much lyrical genius packed into excellent musicianship - no one was more stunned than I was with the results - I think this album, alone, elevates Green Day to legendary status - (not to mention the past ten years of steady chart hits).  Go out and buy it - it is well worth the price and it will be a long time before it leaves your CD player.
B0000C8AQM|4.0|I bought this album the day before yesterday, simply because I hadn't seen it anywhere else and it was the soundtrack to my favourite movie.  <br />I've only had a few quick listens, but highlights are already forming within my mind. These incl.  <br />\\"Seventeen\\" by Stevie Nicks (a great scene in the movie),  <br />\\"My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down\\" by The Ramones &  <br />\\"It's A Long Way To The Top\\" by the School Of Rock band.  <br />The dialogue acting as intervals on the soundtrack are funny, but I don't really see the purpose as it is just as accessable on the DVD (and there you'll also have moving pictures to accompany it! :) ).  <br />The No Vacancy song \\"Heal Me, I'm Heartsick\\" (which by the way, Kid Reviewer, is your song plz that you've been searching for everywhere) I'm not sure about. It sounds alright, but as Jack mentions in the movie- \\"they're just posers\\". Basically, sounds ok, but (as you can hear from the rest of the soundtrack) not real music. <br />Overall, very good rock soundtrack... although, I'm still wondering why the producers decided to cut Iron Man and Smoke On The Water... perhaps a bit too cliche.
0140277447|5.0|Great book to disclose the horrible inhuman war crimes committed by the Japanese troops in China! We should never forget the history, therefore we will (probably) avoid repeating the bad and the ugly in the future. <br /> <br />Chris Chang is not a historian. It is unsurprising that her book contains many errors. However these do not discredit her great work. In fact, many historians from Japan or educated in Japan are notorious at fabricating and twisting the history by denying the existence or extent of Nanking Massacre. In this sense, Chris Chang has done a much more credible work than them. <br /> <br />The background on the denial of Nanking Massacre can be found in the following link published at Japan Focus: <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />Let me quote some paragraphs from it: <br /> <br />In reaction to such attacks (to deny the hundred head contest in Nanking Massacre), Honda dug up and thoroughly refuted their claims with testimonials that: showed the \\"hundred head\\" contest to have been an atrocity committed against prisoners of war (not battle killings) (\\"Shishime testimony\\") [1]; undercut the blunt Japanese sword theory that held that swords would not hold their edge through so many decapitations (Uno testimony) [2]; and made clear that the contest was not just a war correspondent's fabrication (Sato testimony). [3] Then Hora Tomio wrote Nankin daigyakusatsu: \\"maboroshi\\" ka kosaku hihan (The Nanjing Massacre: Criticism of the Making of an Illusion) [4], which refuted Suzuki point by point. In particular, Hora used the testimonies to thoroughly lay bare a false \\"alibi\\" report that the two officers had met war correspondents at the foot of Nanjing's Zhongshan mountain. <br /> <br />The denial thesis (of Nanking Massacre) became increasingly bankrupt in the late 1980s. First, it came to light that Tanaka Masaaki had altered the text in as many as 300 places when he published the field diary of General Matsui Iwane, [the officer in charge of Japanese troopsin Nanjing]. [5] Second, the editors of Kaiko, the publication of Kaikosha, the fraternal organization of former Imperial Army cadets, recognized in print that \\"the Japanese army committed illegal murders in Nanjing.\\" And third, a decision in the Ienaga Saburo textbook suit recognized the existence of the \\"Nanjing Massacre.\\" <br /> <br />In this way the theories denying the Nanjing Massacre were totally discredited, but they were prominently touted again in the late 1990s. That is, by repeatedly emphasizing the denial theories, proponents hoped to persuade people that no massacre had occurred, or if it had, it wasn't so bad. Treating surviving witness Li Xiuying as a fake and filing the current \\"hundred heads\\" libel suit can be seen as part of this effort. These developments are deeply connected to the intensification of reactionary attacks since the beginning of the 1990s. <br /> <br />The current \\"hundred heads\\" libel suit is one prong of an attack that ought to worry the democratic forces that have resisted the militarization of the Japanese state. By rehashing the \\"hundred head\\" issue that ought to have been settled, they are trying to plant among the people a view of history that glorifies and affirms aggression in Asia. <br /> <br />We ought to lay bare the truth that most of the victims who lost their heads in this \\"hundred head contest\\" were unresisting prisoners in an atrocity that was a murderous game to see who could kill the most. But rather than condemn the two officers who wielded swords in this atrocity, we should reveal and broadcast the truth that the core problem was in the Japanese militarist education that fashioned this kind of soldier. Doing so will also serve to foster trust and friendly relations for Japan in Asia and the world.
B00006JJ51|5.0|I have to admit I'm not the biggest rap fan in the world (in fact, I don't like rap too much. I like N.W.A. and Run DMC. The rest of it isn't for me.), but I will say that along with Run DMC, these guys reinvented the genre with this powerful debut album. \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" was the point where rap stopped being a great way to market clean cut young guys like the Fresh Prince (aka Will Smith) to the masses & started telling it like it is. Rap is and always will be street music about life in the neighborhoods and this was never documented more clearly than on this album. With songs like \\"F___ Tha Police\\" and \\"Gangsta Gangsta\\" Dre, Ice Cube, (the late) Eazy E, etc. captured a snapshot of South Central L.A. life that the majority never heard about pre-Rodney King & L.A. riots. Before you go & buy the latest Eminem or 50 Cent release, find a copy of this & discover the REAL reason rap & hip-hop became the voice of a new generation.
B0007GAERG|5.0|If anyone's earned that title, it's Mariah Carey. And when she's on fire, you better watch out. If this album is any evidence to the latter, then I suggest holding on because you will be in for a great ride. She came back like the heavyweight champion of the world.  <br /> <br />The Voice: AMAZING!!! Unlike anything I've heard from her before. Age has definitely been her ally. <br /> <br />The Songs: HOT!!! \\"We Belong Together\\" is the best song she's ever done. I never thought she would be able to top songs like \\"Vision of Love,\\" \\"Hero,\\" and \\"My All.\\" But alas, she has done the unthinkable. <br /> <br />The Beats: ON POINT!!! One particular highlight is the Kanye West driven track \\"Stay The Night.\\" Once again, Kanye comes up with a hot groove.  <br /> <br />Overall: A CLASSIC!!! Mariah's at the top of her game from beginning to end. I would highly recommend this CD. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006LLOG|5.0|Lou Reed staring   from the cover of this album like Frankenstein in mascara gives us a feeling we are going to be in for a rough ride of the heavy metal kind. Nothing could be further from the truth. The album is probably most famous for the seventies hit \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\". However most of the album is unlike that classic rock song. The songs seem like somewhat sweet ballads that lull us almost into complacency until they slap us in the face. One of the great things about this album is how the music is so sweet and somewhat like show tunes and the lyrics are so subtly deviant and oh so clever. <br />Take for example the song vicious. These days a song called \\"vicious\\" would have speed metal guitars. But that would be much too heavy handed for Lou Reed. <br />Here are a few selected lines from that song. <br /> <br />\\"You hit me with a flower <br />You do it every hour <br />Ohh, baby you're so vicious\\" <br /> <br />But Lou Reed does not stop there as he brings up the lyric a notch or two a few lines later. <br /> <br />\\"Hey, why don't you swallow razor blades <br />You must think I'm some kinda gay blade <br />But baby, you're so vicious\\" <br /> <br />In the next song \\"Andy's Chest\\" (most likely referring to the scars Warhol received after the attempt on his life) Reed again accompanies his slightly twisted lyrics with sweetly sounding music. <br />The song begins just like a love song with the line <br /> <br />\\"If I could be anything in the world that flew\\" <br /> <br />But is followed by a line that  leads us into a type of horror movie <br /> <br />\\"I would be a bat and come swooping after you\\" <br /> <br />One of my favorite songs is Perfect Day. And it is a love song  (if a some what twisted one) with a swelling chorus <br /> <br />\\"Oh it's such a perfect day,  <br />I'm glad I spent it with you. <br />Oh such a perfect day, <br />You just keep me hanging on, <br />You just keep me hanging on.\\" <br /> <br />On the surface it seems so wholesome but  theperfect day includes drinking sangria in the park as well as the wonderfully twisted line <br /> <br />\\"You made me forget myself. <br />I thought I was someone else, <br />Someone good.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />It is an incredible album well worth owning and savoring. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|1.0|Being a mariah fan, I've enjoyed all her previous albums because they all had something \\"mariah\\" about them. Except \\"Charmbracelet\\" which rather dissappointing but this one takes the cake. The Emancipation of mimi is mariah's emancipation FROM herself to desperately become Ciara/Ashanti/Beyonce. I would recommend their album because it's much better than mariah's. Except \\"we belong together\\" and \\"it's like that\\", there are no other decent songs. The fact is mariah is trying too hard to be \\"in\\" but in vain, and losing herself in the process. It also shows how money can't buy talent. Neptunes,nelly,snoop dog, L.A.reid and Kanye west have all worked on this album but still couldn't make it as good as Beyonce or Ciara's. truly dissappointing. mariah's best album was her \\"BUTTERFLY\\" after that the \\"glitter\\" turns into dust and \\"charmbracelet\\" was a \\"cursebracelet\\".
B0007GAERG|5.0|If you ever lost faith in Mariah, this is the album for you to buy.  Ever loyal, I rushed out to the local record store (I actually bought a real, live, tangible CD) and picked up her latest effort.<br /><br />In years past, Ms. Carey has tried to appeal to every imaginable demographic by recording every possible genre: Top 40 for those over 30, Dance for those under 30...  She remixed every single for the clubs, she re-recorded a lot of those songs for the remixes.  She tried to start a revolution after her career was waning by releasing that very well known (yet somehow not well listened to) album, Glitter, which payed homage to the 80s sound that seemed to catch on after her record label dropped her.  She tried to revive her ever-failing career by releasing Charmbracelet, full of R&B-like sound, lots of rap, and lots of processed vocals.<br /><br />Mariah gives it another go with her 10th studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi.  This time, she doesn't try to corner the urban market with in-your-face gangsta beats or fluttering vocals.  There's a real honesty to this incredibly soulful R&B disk: pronounced bass, gentle guitars, symphonic strings, delicate pianos, perfectly produced percussion, and, of course, as the website touts, the return of \\"the voice.\\"<br /><br />With the release of the first single from Emancipation, I wrote a mini-review on my old \\"In My iPod\\" sidebar where I stated the the first single could (and should) be a lot better than it was.  \\"It's Like That\\" is, indeed, the most dance-club-remix friendly track on the CD, if only for the lively drum beat.<br /><br />Her second single, \\"We Belong Together,\\" was nothing like I'd expected.  Her voice envelopes every note so delicately that the ear doesn't even realize how the musical arrangement is just a piano and a drum beat, Mariah's lush voice filling every blank space in the track.<br /><br />The rest of the album follows suit: Carey's voice expertly winding its way through each nook and cranny of every song.<br /><br />This album shines as perhaps the pinnacle of Mariah Carey's career by carefully not overproducing each song (as has been her downfall in the past and the trap where similar new releases are caught in today), keeping the musical arrangements simple, and putting the focus back on the eight octave voice that made her a star in the first place.<br /><br />My favorites: Your Girl, We Belong Together, One And Onlynd cranny of every song. <br /> <br />This album shines as perhaps the pinnacle of Mariah Carey's career by carefully not overproducing each song (as has been her downfall in the past and the trap where similar new releases are caught in today), keeping the musical arrangements simple, and putting the focus back on the eight octave voice that made her a star in the first place. <br /> <br />My favorites: Your Girl, We Belong Together, One And Only
B0007X6ST2|5.0|No joke, I'm a huge live recording nut and I sincerely believe this may one of the 5 best live records I've everheard.  It's the band, man.  Sting is an incredible talent on his own, but when you assemble a band as tight as this, the results surpass even the greatness of the original material.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a \\"love it or hate it\\" movie if I've ever seen one.  And I'll say this now to get it out of the way:  the 8 component stories do at times feel rushed and unfinished, Hugh Grant doesn't pass as particularly impressionable as the PM and Bill Nighy (\\"Billy Mack\\") can't sing worth a crap.  Despite all that, however, I loved this movie. <br /> <br />I think the 8 mixed stories intertwine well to witness the full spectrum of how love can build us up or tear us apart.  And we see love at different levels and stages, from Sam's infatuation with a classmate to newlyweds to Harry's near-infidelity.  Many complaints revolve around the assertion that the stories are too far-fetched... but hey, if you can't \\"let go\\" somewhat when you watch a movie you may as well not watch any movies ever. <br /> <br />The movie is also a very good comedy; to me it's even more comedy than romance.  I am a huge fan of British comedy and this film has a very British sensibility.  It has a warm \\"real\\" feeling to it that the average Hollywood production lacks.  Adding to that is the beginning and closing series of video clips showing people reuniting at Heathrow and showing that \\"love actually is all around.\\" <br /> <br />Another factor to a great, memorable movie -- a subliminal factor, if you will -- is the music.  And this movie features some fantastic music; from the classics \\"Jump (for My Love)\\" and \\"God Only Knows\\" to Olivia Olson's admirable performance of \\"All I Want for Christmas is You\\" to the uplifting main theme. <br /> <br />The only downfall that I would have corrected if I had the chance would be to make it another 20 minutes longer, to the end of developing certain segments further.  Nonetheless, I have watched it several times on HBO and have recommended it to my friends because it has become one of my favorite recent movies. <br /> <br />Lastly, I feel compelled to address the negative comments:  many of those people must have been sorely burned to the point that they can'teven enjoy a movie about our most influential emotion.  And some are just wacky -- did you read the one by \\"germania\\"?  Thankfully, most people are not as stone-hearted.
1573223085|5.0|About 2 weeks ago, Dan Pink, of Free Agent Nation fame, sent me an autographed copy of his book, \\"A Whole New Mind\\".    As usual, I want to be candid with you and give you real, honest, heart-felt feedback: When I first took the book out of the wrapper, I thought, \\"Big whoop, another \\"quickie\\" book that will probably read much like cardboard cereal tastes. Good fiber, but excruciatingly boring and downright useless.  \\"      Nevertheless, to feed my voracious reading addiction, I decided to do Dan a favorite and read his little book.    What an enormous paradigm shift when I noticed that I was smiling every time I picked up the book as I rushed to read the next chapter and the next and the next and the next!    For me personally, it's the long awaited companion bookend to one of the most seminally important books in my life: \\"The Mature Mind\\" by Harry A. Overstreet, a book which I first read while I was a young musician assigned to The United States Army Band in Washington, DC where I performed for the Nixon, Ford, and Carter Administrations.  (1970-1977)    Overstreet's book was like a parent to me over ensuing decades.   I returned to it again and again in my desire to better understand what real human relationships was about at its core.    \\"The Mature Mind\\" is still one of my top 2 or 3 books I turn to - all these years later.    So, for me, the best possible thing I can say to you about Dan Pink's book, \\"A Whole New Mind\\", is that it feels just like the missing companion to Overstreet's \\"The Mature Mind\\".     But I won't try to become an overnight book reviewer and pretend to offer you a critical analysis of why Dan's book is so VERY IMPORTANT to you and your future in this sometimes bewilderingly fast changing world.  But because I genuinely care about you and each of the other members on this forum, I want to say to all of you who want to be professional networkers or doctors or anything else dealing with people in the next decade or so, RUN AND GET AND READ AND APPLY Dan Pink's book - today!

B00005JKJA|1.0|nothing. you get nothing from this movie. its basically a pretentious piece of work that calls itself art. david lynch did a terrible job, and the story had no substance. The end made no sense. just an all around waste of time.
B00003CXMG|1.0|really love cameron crowe...but this movie was a piece of royal crap. the only reason i gave it a star was because of the Tiny Dancer song in the bus. I love elton john..haha. But i dont recommend this movie to anyone. its boring, and way too long...and im a fan of the godfather and lord of the rings. this movie is just too long for its own good. if you like cameron crowe, i recommend jerry macguire or SAY ANYTHING
B0002IQNAG|1.0|I gave the remake GLOWING accolades.  Someone in a chatroom (I should have known not to listen!) said that the original was much better.  So I waltzed over to Circuit City and purchased this.  Sigh.  I'll NEVER get that $35.00 back.  I feel so bad for having purchased this.  This movie was not scary.  The zombies were not scary.  The characters were completely insipid.  Perhaps I wouldn't have felt cheated if I'd watched the original before the remake, but had I watched THIS drivel first I wouldn't have WANTED to see the remake--or anything else remotely connected to the movie.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed the remake, which I had to watch 10 times before it no longer scared me at all.  But this--I don't get it.  It wasn't even REMOTELY close to the remake.  How does it get so many positive reviews?
0062502182|4.0|The Alchemist is an inspiring novel about following your dreams. Santiago in pursuing his dream, traveled from his homelands of Spain to the pyramids of Egypt in search of a treasure he once saw in a dream. On his way meeting an old man, a crystal merchant, and the alchemist, Santiago obtained more than the treasure he was in search of. He learned life-long lessons that changed his way of thinking for the remainder of his journey. <br /> <br />Santiago, the main character, followed his dream and it took him to new parts of the world and his life that he never thought were there. This novel is a story of a young man who didn't quite know who he was until after he found his Personal Legend. You too, while reading it can experience and learn new lessons and ideas that you never thought could be true. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to any reader who likes to experience an adventure out of their own world, someone who wants to learn and likes a better than ordinary book. This book is good for someone who likes a story that the plot changes every page. I enjoyed reading this book because of its uniqueness and how I have never read a book that has even a similar idea.
