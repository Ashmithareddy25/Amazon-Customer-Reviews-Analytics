B004GTQ4DI|5.0|I watched Return to Cranford without watching the first Cranford, so it was a little hard to follow the story, but I still enjoyed it very much.  I especially loved the romance between William and Peggy.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I was never much of a fan of the original Wizard of Oz. Perhaps if Walt Disney had done it, I would have liked it more.<br /><br />This was an entertaining introduction to the Wizard and his origins.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Great production and songs. Makes a nice date night movie. Second best behind la miserable. Give it a shot I know you will love it.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! It was written very well and I couldn't put it down! I recommend for anyone looking for an easy, engaging read.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Works great between the iPod adapter that came with my 2009 Infinity convertible and the Apple lightning to 30-pin adapter cable for my iPhone 5.  It allows me to use my iPhone 5 just as I would an iPod with the car's stereo system and adds charging.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is one of the best authors of this generation. He never fails to bring great works for the shelves of adoring readers. I couldn't put it down!
B004EF65QA|5.0|I love BBC period dramas and this one did not disappoint me.  I didn't realize that industrialization and the issues between &#34;masters&#34; and workers had already surfaced before the middle of the 19th Century.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I want to find out what happens next.  A real page turner.  I can feel their love.<br />They have an exciting life.
B002QRWJA4|3.0|Great music and sets but I found the heroine to be a bit dumb and I found that distracting. Still, it's worth seeing.
B00CEJ2H6K|4.0|Deceiver of the Gods is a solid album that's worth picking up for sure. While it's one of Amon Amarth's weakest LPs to date it's still a good listen. Amon Amarth are one of the most consistently enjoyable acts in melodic death metal and even at their worst their albums are still some of the best and most entertaining death metal albums available. Recommended for those Amon Amarth faithfuls as well as newcomers to their brand of viking infused melodeath.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It's an awesome adorable game for my angels. However they found it a tad confusing w the tasks you were given. We figured it out after a bit confusion and they love it. Great app. My kids are 5 n 7.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I really enjoy generational books and the fact that this series is a trilogy gives me something even more to look forward to.  I like the way Mr. Archer catches you up on the people's lives from the time the last book ended and this one begins. The book is somewhat predictable but I like that as well.
B003QO8TDC|5.0|This movie has very special meaning for me.  I was a senior in high school and in love with an older manl
B00CH26TL8|5.0|have always liked this game i find it challenging and i am very happy to be able to play on my Kindle fire which i love also
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|If you like Grim and other movies like this , this one is awesome. Action and great scenes. Very enjoyable and entertaining.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|decent movie not as good as the first but on par with the second worth watching nice that it is included with prime at the moment
B000FC11A6|2.0|There are lots of great reviews on this book, but I found it boring and un-engaging. I finally gave up on it. Apparently setting up the background for the main plot was too long and uninteresting for me.
0451169514|5.0|Wow! That's all I can say to describe how great and utterly amazing this book is. It compares to no other. I went through an entire array of emotions during my time of reading It. Horror, shock, laughter, sadness, hate, joy, dread. You name it!<br /><br />This was beautifully written an expertly plotted and paced that I could not get enough of It. It is honestly the most evil creature ever imagined! You will never ever guess how things will turn out! Its literally that unpredictable! I was so sad when it was over and quite frankly wish it could have gone on for another 1,000 pages!<br /><br />So don't worry about the sheer size of this masterpiece. It is TOTALLY worth every page. I would give this a hundred stars if I could! Its just THAT AWESOME! This is one tale I will never forget and will plan on re-reading again! Everything you could ever want in a book is in here. Trust me, you will not wanna miss out on this brilliantly told story!
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|It felt like I too was traveling the rough roads and seeing and smelling Africa, and alongside the #1 lady detective. An enjoyable read. I want to share more of her experiences.
B0063M22QO|5.0|makes you think before you play.  very though provoking and you will be centered on your next play.  enjoy yourself.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Good price, speedy delivery.  Trying to complete the series so I can watch them in order and perhaps understand them as well as my grandson does.
B006PFC2S2|4.0|They don't write them like this anymore... Luscious melodies from L&L, Technicolor stands up to recent digital revolution. Wow Wow.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Good price, speedy delivery.  Trying to complete the series so I can watch them in order and perhaps understand them as well as my grandson does.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|This game was really good except it said it was a full game and not a demo, other then that I enjoyed it.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Good price, speedy delivery.  Trying to complete the series so I can watch them in order and perhaps understand them as well as my grandson does.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it it has all the cool things my frineds whet talking about I even wrote &quot;I love temple run and I love u&quot; in my boyfriends note book!!!!!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Good price, speedy delivery.  Trying to complete the series so I can watch them in order and perhaps understand them as well as my grandson does.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As always, Mr. Connelly tells a great story!  I can never put one of his books down once I start reading.  This one was as exciting and thrilling to read as his other books about Harry Bosch.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love this game and have it on phone. The tablet updated to my game on my phone and it's fun to continue it on my Kindle.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|game is addicting. love that even though there are two money sources there are always more to get each. haven't had any glitches so far either.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|I like the game a lot and hope they come out with a second. However,I would of liked to be able to choose my person, customise my ride, and be able to upgrade storage.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I am an ardent Scifi fan, but never got into this series, when it started.  Maybe reviewing the first two seasons will make it click.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|This attractive but silly story requires a complete suspension of disbelief.  Who would have thought the entire Pacific Ocean glows in the dark in stunning blues and purples?  That an island made of nothing but trees and roots could support thousands of meercats (ferrets?) per acre?  Personally, I would have shot the tiger in the head with the flare gun at first daylight.  Read a book called \\"Adrift\\" instead.
B0015DROBO|5.0|A friend of mine told me that the book started out slow and to give it time. I am so glad I listened to her. Once the story revved up, it didn't stop! The names are hard to remember and since it wasn't originally written in English, some of the concepts are hard to follow. There is so much more than one story going on. I read this first book in two days and just stopped to write this review before starting on the next one.<br /><br />Give this one time to suck you in, and enjoy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Rated the highest, easy to use, not very complicated, but also thought provoking.  Great for all ages and quick to understand.
0312370849|4.0|Rosnay did a great job telling the story of what happened in Parish July 1942. I don't recall hearing it before. Her portrayal of Sarah gives a taste of what so many Jewish children must have experienced. It is heartbreaking to think of the pain so many innocent children-families suffered. It needed to be told.
0394818237|5.0|Back then we kids didn't have tablets, but some books were even better. To say I loved this one is an understatement. Every image, every detail is printed in my memory.<br />Bonus: this gizmo doesn't require batteries, and never gets obsolete.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|overall similar to the xbox version... def worth the price for the game and free cards... a bit laggy but its not too bad.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|If you are a fan of mtg you will love this game, must have app on your android device. Buy it if you can.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The book dragged and was without a story line for about 2/3 of the book.  Will not be reading the sequel.
145210655X|4.0|For star wars fans, it's an endearing way to share the star wars universe with your kids.  Usually gets a chuckle out of the adults as well.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is great. Would recommend to any of my friends! Can't wait to read the next book. Hope it come out soon.
0812550706|5.0|I'm only writing this review to add my vote to the many people who have enjoyed this book.  Please read this book before the movie comes out.
B00D1HC8VS|5.0|I used to own the album. The remastered version is a little heavier on the bass, but I LOVE THAT! Vocals are clearer and fine! The bonus CD from The Cow Palace in San Francisco is a SWEET treat! (It brought back the all the sensations of singing & playing along - BDay gift 4/1978!)
B0073COMUW|4.0|I love that these bulbs do NOT throw off heat like the usual incandescent.  I am hopeful they will save me $$$ on my utility bills.  I am in the process of replacing all my bulbs in the house with LED.  These really changed the kitchen temp, and light mood.  So far my only experience is on lights aiming down on a surface.  I like the bulbs a lot, they are really expensive, but IF they live up to the cost saving, well - all the better.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|i thoroughly enjoyed the first two books he wrote so i was thrilled to see he had written a third. i even pre-ordered it so i could read it the minute it came out. i would definitely recommend it but i have to say i was disappointed in that it didn't quite measure up to his previous novels!
B0050IY61G|5.0|I have been fence sitting for over a decade as to whether my son might have Asperger's Syndrome. A good friend who had a son diagnosed with Asperger's suggested I read this book. She referred to it as the definitive resource on the subject. The book is a very good resource for parents of Asperger's children.  It brings things into focus and can help educators also in helping these young people navigate not only their school years, but the world from their perspective.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|i thought this book would be an O.K. read. several of my friends had read it and recommended it so i said &#34;why not&#34;. boy am i glad i did! it was a very engaging storyline that kept me thinking the whole way through!! even when i thought i knew what was going to happen, the story takes a turn!! definitely a book that will make you think about the lengths you would go for your family!
B008JFUPFI|3.0|The \\"Man of Steel\\" is a movie of extensive computer animation, action and flashback of defining moments of superman's childhood; starred by Zack Snyder, Russell Crowe and Kelvin Costner.<br /><br />Most of us know that Superman is an alien, coming from a dying star; the movie covers a bit more about the star Krypton. Krypton is a star with heavier gravity and tons of science advancement - a glimpse of why the people there can fly on earth and their power.  Kryton is dying after many years of rapid evolution in science where the population is planned, every birth is planned with a purpose; and the leadership council is incompetent. Superman's father is the leading scientist and hopes to find a solution through his son, who is the only natural birth.  At the same time, the head general starts a coup to get rid of the incompetent council (with somewhat similar purpose to extend the life of people).  With the rivalry and the crisis, come tons of action and scientific animation.  Infant Superman is sent to the planet Earth; and the leading general was captured with an exile, just before the total collapse of Kryton.<br /><br />Superman, with an earth name of \\"Clark Kent\\" is brought up in Kansas. Kelvin Costner, playing the role of his father, is an unbelievable perfect guy in the movie; who is convicted that Clark is here with a purpose for big things?  Then it tells some defining moments in Clark's childhood - his relationship with parents, his relationship with his classmates, his struggle to understand his power and his loneliness to live a different life.<br /><br />Just when we think this maybe something different, the standard ingredients show up and take over.  Amy Adam's Lois Lane, the \\"future-to-be girlfriend\\" of Superman movie, shows up; the bad guy shows up, this case, the lead general in exile; the bad guy threatens to destroy earth; then superman comes; saves the world with obviously extensive collateral damages. As bad guy confesses that he is born with thepurpose to protect the greater good of Krytonians, is he really a bad guy?<br /><br />If you like Superman story, there is something of everything in this movie.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love this series of books. They are so funny. I read them to my son. WE both laugh out loud reading these books. Would recommend.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|this was an excellent movie, the special effects were great, and the story was good. I hope the sequel is just as good.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Funny and fantastic. wish this wasnt the last book. Thoroughly enjoyed reading all these books to my son. We laugh out loud. Would recommend.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I had never heard of this movie before we rented it. We had another couple over and they suggested we rent it. It was pretty good, we enjoyed all the cheesy jokes, and there were a couple of twists we didn't see coming. There are some predictable parts (quite a few) but that's to be expected in the genre. Overall I really enjoyed the movie. I was entertained. The predictability and cheesiness is why I gave it 4/5.<br /><br />Worth my time. I enjoyed it!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This must be the new game all the kids are playing. My son loves it. Very interactive and educational. Would recommend.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love being able to share my kindle collection with my children.  This app makes that possible.  What's not to love about an app that shows you your kindle library?  I can't wait to get a smart phone that can utilize this as well!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I love this series of books. They are so funny. I read them to my son. WE both laugh out loud reading these books. Would recommend. 5 stars all the way
B00CWY76CC|4.0|add more levels and ill make the rate better from 4 stars to 5 stars ok its so good please make more.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Makes my son happy. He likes this as it actually gives names to the birds. He loves angry birds. Has all of them now. Would recommend.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This series is pretty good.  It's along the same lines as 50 Shades.  Some of the story lines are truly gripping.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves it. Plays it on the main computer more but i think this one has more gadgets. If i am correct. Would recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wasn't sure how it worked at first, and before I knew it, I was addicted! Fun to play, and you can start and stop at any points/o losing your progress.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Goodold solitaire - fun, easy, good to have around when you are stuck in traffic or can't sleep at night.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I decided this book in one sitting and feel like I've learned so much already. It's amazing what an eye opener this book was, especially since its so simple and uncomplicated in its approach. Very accessible! I'm curious now to learn more and,hopefully, be able to start putting these lessons to good use before much longer.
B0063M22QO|3.0|The layout that I am familiar with is missing - it might be the original layout.  It is more challenging than the layouts in this  product.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|'Can You Escape' is great fun!! I love the challenge and have a great sense of success every time the elevator doors open!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|i loved the book, but was very disappointed with the ending as it made no since! i hope that there is another book coming up very soon.
B00C5W3SBE|2.0|This movie was not at all what I expected. I think it was made to be &#34;hokey&#34; (for lack of a better word) on purpose, but that aspect really ruined the movie for me. It wasn't good acting (I have come to expect better from these actors/actresses), the story was weak and I just plain didn't like it.<br /><br />I was so disappointed because I really love the Wizard of Oz and the books and wanted to see this movie live up. It didn't.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book combines emotion, a glimpse of a place and time that exist no longer, and challenges the reader with ethical issues.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game. It takes your mind off of your troubles for a time.  It is very addictive. I enjoy it.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|I wasn't sure about this show after the first season.  It is very suspenseful to the point of inducing anxiety and the characters were not necessarily likable.  However, the second season does a good job with the development of the characters, so that one becomes invested in them.  It is very gory, but of course that is appropriate given he subject matter.  I would not recommend this for anyone under 13-14.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game. you actually care for your horse and compete with him and buy more horses to care for.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I downloaded this app for my daughter &amp; watching her I became intrigued. Now I can't stop trying to solve my escape. It's really worth playing.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|Love the whole movie...only thing that bothers me at all in it is the voice of the wicked witch...I know that she has to be able to sound sweet, no problem with that, but just not wicked sounding enough for me.  Love that this movie ties in to everything we know from the original movie.
1781162646|5.0|I think everything that needs to be said has been said in the previous reviews.<br /><br />Just wanted to say that I really enjoyed this book.  Made me laugh and cry.  One of King's best.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|...since I have enjoyed a series this much.  Really sad there are only 4 Seasons total.  Lots of action, and great graphics.  This last season is very much in the theme of the 24 series with Keifer Sutherland.  Each show is a cliff hanger that tells a bit more of a much larger story.<br /><br />I never saw the series when it first came out (my work schedule didn't jive with TV).  But since I have Amazon Prime, I can watch what I want when I want.<br /><br />I don't watch much of the current TV programming, because it is mostly C$%P these days.  But Star Trek has decent morals and good wins out over evil, though it must struggle to do so.  Even my wife is enjoying it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great puzzle game to keep mind sharp! Love the challenge! Highly addictive and fun for everyone to play. Enjoyment for the whole family!
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is wild.  The twist that Sherlock is up on technology puts this over the top.  I love it how they show the text messages and they use GPS.  The original would not have that!!
B0064T6LV8|1.0|The screen size was bulky and awkward, and the flippers were too sensitive on my tablet screen, so it got annoying not being able to play it. Good app, but it needs some editing to make it a lot better
1451627297|5.0|One the best stories I have ever read!<br />I strongly recommend this even to those who are not Stephen King's fans!
B006215P8I|5.0|Lost. The best show that will always keep you on your toes and thinking about what it all really means. While some say the later seasons are not as good. I think they are just as good if not better!
074356619X|4.0|Awesome for the road, that what I used it for.  I had watched the movie then I listed to it for awhile one the road.  Its pretty cool to have n pass down!
B0062162N0|5.0|The Others! Another great season of Lost. We learn more about the others and our friends from flight 815. The best
B000ASATWQ|5.0|This will go down as one of the reggae albums in the 00's!!  The production quality is so potent, along with collaborations with his bro Steph and others.  Overall great cast, producing, and one of Damian's best.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Riveting and entertaining, great storyline, Great chemistry with the cast of characters. This is one series that you could never get enough of........ great!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game.I play it all the time.I play It at home on the bus at work and at the park.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|like the adventure and didn't want it to end. wanting more now we got to wait until oct to continue the story. uggghhh. I liked the story line. Looking forward to the next book.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game has many elements that give it depth of play. I am addicted! I recommend it for any serious gamer.
B002NZK5TG|4.0|If Amazon would sort the reviews of a product so that they remain with the specific version being reviewed, rather than, as in this case, lumping all the reviews of \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" together and leaving customers to sort through all of them. I loved this movie when I was younger, and I still do. My son recently saw it on television and wanted the DVD so he could watch it any time he wanted. But he wanted to have both the theatrical ending and the original ending he had only seen on the internet. So I set about trying to buy a DVD. The Blu-Ray, from what I can figure out, seems to have both endings, but we're one of the last remaining families in the world without a Blu-Ray player...and I don't necessarily want to buy one at this point. So, I kept reading reviews and eventually ordered the Director's Cut DVD, thinking it had both versions of the movie. I must have read something wrong, because when it arrived, it only has the version of the movie with the Director's Cut ending. Now I'm ordering the DVD version issued in 2000 in an attempt to get the theatrical ending, so we can have the option of which ending we want to watch. None of you probably care about this, by I'm hoping to make a point to the Amazon staff. I'm very tired of having to sift through hundreds of reviews to try to figure out which version of a DVD has all the features I want. Please, please consider listing the reviews with the specific DVD version to which it applies. Thanks.<br /><br />And just to make my review more review-y...Little Shop of Horrors is a great movie, no matter which ending you prefer. What's not to love? A nerdy Rick Moranis; lovely Ellen Green, small roles by Christopher Guest, John Candy, Steve Martin, and others; the wonderful songs (\\"Suppertime\\" is one of our favorites); and of course, the man-eating plant with the voice of Levi Stubbs. If you haven't seen it, you should. So four stars for the movie, but minus one because it's so difficult to figure out which reviewgoes with which version of the movie.
0425263924|4.0|I was disappointed I waited so long for this 3rd book.  As always, I enjoyed the storyline Sylvia Day penned.  I cannot wait to get my hands on book 4.
B00847KFDS|5.0|John Fogerty has updated his classic songs using duets with a new generation of singers and new arrangements.  Several new songs are appealing.  John's voice is strong.  It's a great album.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and am going back to read it again.  I recently lost my husband and found this book extremely comforting.  I am a firm believer that we are spiritual beings and Dr. Alexander's experiences more than confirmed my beliefs.I am grateful to him for his attempt to share his heavenly experiences in our limited earthly language.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Only the best of the best.  A fabulous collection for any Andrea Bocelli addict!!!  Listen day or night, relax to this wonderful selection of songs.
1451695195|4.0|A believer for Christ gained by this experience. I believe his experience and he will be a witness for Christ.
006123205X|4.0|It allowed me to understand my wife and other women in my life better.  It also is a great talking tool for me and my wife to save or marriage.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a very fun game, lots of stuff to do. Enjoyed playing the mini fish game. And making new family. You can't put it down.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|This, the latest (and last) Culture novel, has got to rank with Iain Bank's best work. The storyline is fairly simple but he manages to bring so much into play. The Ships' Minds play a big role in this novel and it is all the better for the wit that they bring.<br /><br />I would compare this novel to &#34;Player of Games&#34; for the depth of the intrigue and plots within plots.<br /><br />An Iain M Banks book normally takes me about 2 weeks to read but I got through this one in 5 days. Absolutely one of my favorite.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|While obviously a tough topic which you can pick up from reading between the lines from early on, the story gives you Hope throughout (rather than Hopeless as the title suggests).
B0013V3GN8|4.0|It was a gift for my sister and she says that it was very well done.  Enjoyed it very much.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book! Filled with action. Once you start reading it you can't put it down. Read the other ones to.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|fun to watch lots of action and with a few twists, Bruce Willis is as always a greate tough guy
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Love it but they need to make the land cheaper<br /><br />The thing is that you can't collect much money it hard
0670026638|5.0|I loved the rich detail that allowed me to glimpse the lives of the two characters and understand that they were deeply interwoven though they lived a world apart.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is great. I like the objectives and the ability to add friends to help with the objectives. I don't like how long it takes to renew your energy but I will continue to play.
B00BGQ2OYC|1.0|The same as my vinyl copy of Wolfgang Amadeus, this record sounds super scratchy, as if the speed is inconsistent. I don't know what they are doing wrong when they press these albums, but it's terrible quality. I've never had a sound issue with any other records but Phoenix. So disappointing, I love this band.<br />The album's music is great in a digital format though: CD or mp3 (NOT ripped from vinyl).
B002M7A79S|3.0|If not then this is nothing more than a low-budget movie. Since I have never seen Firefly, I was trying to figure out the characters from the start. I guess it received great ratings from all the Firefly viewers.
B001FQFFMG|5.0|Big time Cash fan. Would even consider owning it and I don't typically buy movies. Great true love story. Would watch again.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is the best in the psy/changling series yet.  Story lines are pulled together,characters explained and developed, mystery, intrigue, suspense, romance, this has it all! You HAVE to read this book!., You HAVE to read the whole series!
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|What a waste of time and the actors' energy!  I'd rather be cleaning my bathroom, doing laundry, weeding the garden...
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Multiple locked room, from which you have to figure out how to escape. These are fun. They are hard enough to be challenging, but not crazy so that you cannot do them. Recommended. I hope they make more of 'em!!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Case does everything I need it to. Light, easy to put on and take off, cover with elastic is also good.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|I bought this without hearing anything on it.  I was very pleasantly surprised!!  More than 40 years after &#34;Smoke on the Water&#34; and Ian Gillan and Co. still have it!! Not so much in the upper range anymore, but still rockin'!!  The more I listen to it the more I like it.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|They Jorge calendar allows me to easily establish my scheduling of appointments with descriptive details. I really like the monthly calendar page to see each morning for what needs done.
B000NY12LO|3.0|This book has a very interesting twist.  I enjoyed reading it.  It is easy to read and keeps you interested.
B00BWGISB4|4.0|This is a great 1st album after so many years.  It is their sound, yet new, and all grown up.  As am I.  Fun uptempo songs as well as Jordan Knight singing ballads in his classic style.  If you were a fan then, you will definately be now.  If you weren't, give it try you may be pleasantly surprised.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Compelling, emotionally- driven drama that holds the viewer's attention throughout the movie. It leaves you with a better understanding of the human wil for survival and power of  family relationships. The fact that it is based on one families actual experience adds to the depth.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|My young niece likes playing this game.  After a few minutes, I'm board.  It holds no challenge for me.  The character faces are silly and you can't help but giggle.  A fun few minutes if you want to mentally decompress.
B0007OCG56|5.0|This was one of Adam Sandlers better movies. Tea Leoni and Cloris Leachman are funny. Of course Paz Vega was very good and she is just plain gorgeous!!
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This is the real story of a real man! I have the greatest respect for anyone who can turn their life around..... and be honest enough it sugar coat reality!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My 83 year old mother loved this for mother's day.  This is a series that will appeal to the entire family and will be watched over and over.  They don't call it Masterpiece Classics for nothing!
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Look, I know there's a lot of haters of this movie, and I know the movie is ridiculously unlike the book in many ways.  I do, however, have a soft spot in my heart for the movie which I have a tendency to think of separately from the books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it!!! It's great to the last word! The details, I can picture everything in mind. I couldn't but the book down, I read every minute I could!
B00COMLLX2|2.0|I just thought this was  a simple pinball app. It wasn't. There was way too much going London. The graphics where so busy too. It couldn't follow the ball. Maybe I am just old and  not a real gamer, lol. I don't know....it just wasn't  what I was  looking for. I just wanted a simple pinball game.
B004XWLIJS|5.0|This is a remake of a Charles Bronson movie with the same title.  Quite often the remake is not as good as the original but in this case the remake is just as intriguing.  Statham is mechanic (hit man) for the mob and takes on an apprentice with out his bosses approval.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Brilliant concept, writing, acting, cinematography, etc. It's the best show on tv after Game of Thrones. I've even started watching the series again.
B00AAKZPUK|5.0|This is my favorite Robert Redford movie and I enjoy seeing it over again every now and then.  The story line is great and the actors do an excellent job.  Redford works for the CIA reading books, lots of books and stumbles across something that he should not have.  So some corrupt officials want to eliminate Redford and the small book reading group.  Redford survives the initial attempt and the rest of the movie is about him evading the bad guys.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|I don't like the video pop-ups that appear between games.  I don't like that when you reach a certain level, there are constant requests to sign in to facebook, and several times I couldn't get past the request boxes.  I don't use facebook, don't care to share my score with friends, I just want to play the game without these interuptions.  Will most likely delete the game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun makes you think how things work together to open doors on elevator. can't. wait until new games come out.
B005ZUR724|5.0|best game i love monks  they are pretty sweet and alot of the community people are helpful. add if you want my name is MmmTwinkies see you there hahah
B00992CF6W|5.0|The reason that I love Minecraft is that it inspires my 11-year old son to utilize his critical thinking skills.  It's been teaching him to organize, plan, evaluate and even perfect his projects to his satisfaction.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Sweet game, its life like  and considering its free, its an amazing deal to not take advantage of. Kids would love this as well as adults.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, the continuing love story of Gideon and Eva. Their challenges and determination to stay together, so beautifully written. I am looking forward to more...
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I missed most of the original programing at 10 p.m. on a Monday night before the series closed. I am delighted to find it on Amazon. The best part are the musical numbers, broadway quality. Much better than Glee.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read this book any minute I got, I was a little leary because of the &#34;X&#34; rated or romance parts that I had heard of. but there is so much more to the book than that, it is a great book!!! I read all three with in a mater of 2 weeks.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|This is a solid story of a kid pursuing a dream with interesting characters and relationships and some truly amazing footage throughout.  If you're into surfing, you should see it.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This app is really fun and if you want to learn how to do makeup or something when you get older then this app is prefect! Kids and all ages can use this app!
0061906220|5.0|We love the cadence of Pete the Cat books and I love my white shoes does not disappoint! It is not unheard of to hear the children reassure each other throughout the day that it is &#34;All good.&#34; when faced with difficulties.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I have enjoyed this series very much and would highly recommend it. I hope I can find more like it!
B000FBJHZS|3.0|Actually I just want to rate it, and not write a comment. so here it is. 3 stars from me.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this app, you can go on realms if you have an account for 7.1! I can't stop playing!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is full of excitement. Eva and Gideon are so interesting. Bared to you and reflected in you is running a close second to 50 shades on my list!! Read it<br /> You won't regret it!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gillian writes great books. I'm always let down by the wrap up at the end though that is too quick and easy.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This app is practical and simple to use. There is a fair amount of options and overall everything is displayed nicely and easy to read. I like that you can add your own music as an option for a  ring to wake up too. The weather display is nice so you can get a quick idea of what lies ahead for you once you leave the house.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Enjoyed the story. Some parts were overstated while other structural elements required a bit more fleshing out. I do look forward to reading Speaker for the Dead.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I am enjoying the fourth season but hate the fact that I have to pay for it since I am a prime member and it now being shown as a reruns on tv.  But I am hooked.  pt
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|Makes picture red when 1 to 6 meter deep, must take it off in the begining of the dive.<br />ok
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Entertaining game, challenging enough to keep interest yet not to touch to frustrate. Definitely worth the money. Storyline is well thought out, graphics pretty good as well.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|When lcd is on, battery is empty after 40 minutes of usage,<br />you have to have an extra battery waiting after each dive.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|hill climb racing is the best game because its racing and boys and girls like racing its really so much fun
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|Okay this game is fantastic and really fun. With only a few twerks, such as the repetitive dialogue. But my main issue is that you cant play the game to its full extent without &quot;glu-points&quot; which are a currency for &quot;glu&quot; games... unfortunately to purchase the many cool firearms you need to use real money to get glu points... this creates a &quot;Pay to Play&quot; type of game. All things considered it is a free game. 3/5.
B007Y36K46|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie (Even though the book was ten times better) there are 4 other books that the producer decided to conglomerate into 1 book or movie.....Had they thought this would have been a blockbuster for sequels
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I had such high hopes for this book - but MAN, was it hard to follow!<br /><br />Definitely worth reading, but pay attention!
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|I made it 10 minutes into this fiasco before I turned it off.  I usually think of Tom Hanks with high quality.  Not this time though.  I hate giving it even 1 star.
1933865474|5.0|I've been a fan of Bruce Timm since Batman the Animated Series premiered back during the Fox Kids days. He has been one of the artist I've been waiting for to release an artbook and I'm glad he finally did. This book is full of amazing pinup art. If you have the chance and the money I suggest the hardcover edition that comes with more artwork. I wish I did before they had sold out. Regardless of which one you pick up (paperback or hardcover) it's a great book to add to your collection.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Very cool game with lot of action and it has excellent graphics very neat game with lots of things to do. You can really get lost in all the fun.
B0049J2BSM|4.0|well, obviously a fun one for every family. we enjoyed the movie with &#34;monster juice&#34; and made our own playdoh monster creations... think beyond the TV &#34;box&#34; ;o)
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is so much more!  I have laughed (out loud) many times!  It has the romance, don't get me wrong, but it also has insight, humor, and lots of sarcasm!  And to say that I know the characters inside and out?  Well, that's an understatement!
B004P4O87I|5.0|Great product as usual from Amazon. Lego never fails with quality and hours of fun. Just don't step on a lego bare footed.
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|The movie its fine, but i have a problem with the uv copy, because only can be download in eeuu and i live in southamerica. also the uv copy have a expire date (2014) so it dosent work for me yet. I hope i can found the way to download it before the expire date.<br /><br />La película esta buen, pero tengo un problema con la copa uv ya q solo se puede descargar en eeuu y yo vivo en sudamerica. Además la copa uc tiene fecha de expiración (2014) así q no me sirve aún. Espero encontrar la firma de bajarla antes de la fecha de expiración.
B00701L5XS|4.0|I have instructed knot tying for fire department, scouting and fishing and have used the Grogs Knots program to instruct inrecent years. This is a very comparable tool, and the only reason I think I wouldn't give it a full five stars is simply in my personal experience I find Grogs Knot program to be slightly easier to use, control and locate different knots by different names. If you have an interest in knots I encourage you to try both and see wich works best for you.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is only missing online play, yeah it got the blue tooth thing, but it isn't the same. Other wise the sealed deck play is the strongest feature
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Very accessible book (also purchased for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it).  If you are familiar with Dawkins' other books then you know how challenging it can be to understand him when he speaks using his full linguistic might.<br /><br />Not a problem with this book; in fact, it's quite the opposite.  Dawkins does an excellent job explaining things that would otherwise be conceptually hard to understand.  The &#34;thought experiments&#34; are a great example of this.<br /><br />I highly recommend!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved this book, I just felt some of it was rushed!<br />Spoiler Alerts...<br />I think Eva shouldn't have rushed into marrying Gideon like she did. There are still A LOT of issues to be resolved... Looking forward to the next book, though! It's still a great read! Lots of Juicy stuff!
B0090KZDSK|1.0|I was waiting for this book to be published for months and was very disappointed with it - no story at all and not even an end. Good luck with the next 2 books, surely I will not buy them.
B002X1JKG4|5.0|It has it all for everyone to enjoy.  Romance Comedy Action.  A great watch.  It keeps your attention through out the movie.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Entertaining (mindless) but simply more of the same...another action movie with Bruce Willis doing his typecast role. Good auto crash scenes.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really really Love it!!!! And u will love it too!!!! Hope they add more rooms very soon!!!! Can't wait!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Not crazy about this app compared to the app on my andriod phone, but<br />it is still a better search engine that Bing
1250006341|5.0|If you are a real hard core Downton Abbey fan you will really enjoy this book!  In addition to showing photos and discussion about the characters and stars in Downton Abbey they also show other fashions and customs of that given time and review that period of history in some depth so one can really understand the historical background of the story!!  I sat right down and leafed through each page the minute I opened it up and enjoyed every page.  Now I must go back and review it all more thoroughly!!!  My sister gave me a copy and I am giving my daughter a copy for her birthday!!!
159562015X|5.0|I used this at a sales meeting and was great fun. Also fun to do with your family. Good stuff in this book. I say try it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This was great and worth every penny! I would totally get it if I were you! It's fun to build and destroy stuff in creative and survival mode. Just be sure to take refuge before nightfall in survival mode.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! JOHN Grisham always surprises me and pleases me with his story telling! Thank you!<br /><br />I
B00BHMEALA|5.0|I have watched it five times since purchasing it.  A part of history I knew not of until this movie came out.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|First of all this is a great book that hooked me from the very beginning. I saw that the movie cloud atlas was coming out, and I heard that it was based on a book. I always like to read the book before I see the movie, and I was very glad I did it in this case. Reading this book made the movie ten times more enjoyable because I was able to follow what was going on and it was very interesting to see the authors themes being portrayed on the big screen. I recommend this book to everybody who is interested in a good read. Both the book and movie are great.
B00596WEVI|5.0|Another fantastic Van Damme movie for my collection.  The story on this one was excellent and I loved the other actors in it.  They were all so convincing.
B00628RVV0|5.0|what an amazingly powerful story to drive home the evil of the Nazi party. The ending is a huge surprise, and my feelings shocked me. I won't spoil it for you, but this is a much watch. Well done.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I was never a fan of Angelina Jolie until Mr. & Mrs. Smith.  After that, I was sold on her skills as an actress.  Salt was a thriller!
0738711500|4.0|I am in love with Tarot cards. the book is OK for the beginner, though in a few days it was not enough for me to get the full depth of the reading. I acquired other books for that. However, I feel very deeply connected to these cards.They are absolutely adorable.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|What a fantastic movie.  Statham was so convincing as the mechanic and the story was superior.  Actors were quality and as always, Statham kept you glued to the show.
B004V73FGE|4.0|if you are then you probably spent most of your childhood in a video game parlor. this pays respect to that first groundbreaking movie. it's a true sequel picking up exactly where the first flick left off. give it a try
B00D6BQG1W|2.0|I have to say that it came across as a well polished zombie-twist movie in the preview. However, it ended up just concreting my fear of movies that give away too much plot in that 60 seconds they have your attention for.<br /><br />I am sure everyone is dubbing this the zombie twilight because that's what it is. Overly-skinny 20 somethings playing to the teenage crowd for \\"the sake of love.\\"<br /><br />As a comic book movie loving guy the over produced zombie Apocalypse effects gave me just barely enough eye-candy to sit through the whole thing. While my softer side wanted to like the great idea of a zombie coming back to life it was disappointing in so many ways. It was poorly acted, poorly directed, and everything that wasn't special effects was so under polished I would have a hard time saying that your teenage daughter would even like it.<br /><br />Don't even ask what I thought about it from a mature, artistic or academic standpoint. I am dissapointed that such an original idea in a massively overplayed genera had no metaphors, no motifs, and absolutely no Ambition to be anything other than a tweeny targeted time consumer.
B008Y6YLBG|4.0|this flick shows the true range of this versatile and daring young actor. a must see if your'e a fan
1400095204|5.0|HALF A YELLOW SUN by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is one of the best books I've ever read. Heck, it might even be THE best book I've ever read. Adichie mellifluously weaves a story among characters who come alive on the page in a way that deeply involves the reader in their fates. I give it 5 stars easily. This is what good writing is all about.
B001609SQA|5.0|The 80s have a special corner on classic films that will survive the ages, and Aliens is one that sets the highest bar for science fiction!
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|I liked it despite everything but if I have to give a rating I cannot give three stars as I sort of did not get the point of continuation of predictable plot devices for the servant ground but rather unpredictable shocker killing of the characters in master level. Alright, one tragic death but two - with only 3 episodes inbetween - that's a it too overdramatic.<br />The only way I see this continuing is to move the action to the end of 1930s when the little kids are in their teens.
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Don't let the subtitles stop you--this film is gut wrenching, tragic and beautiful.  Words cannot sufficiently describe the horrors, the majesties and the heartbreaks.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Wonderful book with a new and innovative plot line. A must have for lovers of Twilight and Hunger Games. Can't wait for the movie this summer!
B004S49YEM|4.0|I enjoyed the meticulous detail in the description of all the characters and the way that he built the suspense to the final conclusion. Did find the conclusion just a little far fetched.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Teenage girls will probably love this tome because it's all wrapped up in vampires, werewolves & psychics of one sort or other.  But I thought it was just stupid.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This was a cool fantasy movie. The interpretation of how the story line goes compaed to what most kids had grown up to know was very interesting.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is primarily the story of a German Fighter Pilot.  It is an interesting look at the aerial battlefields of WWII from N Africa to the final defense of Germany.  Fantastic story, well told, hard to put down!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I never saw this show when it was on tv as I didn't watch tv much before, but I stumbled across it on my kindle and love it.  I would have watched all of the seasons and finished it by now.  but its me and my bfs show so I only watch it when I can see him, and we watch it together.  Love Love Love it though!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app! I use it every night to help me sleep. I highly recomemd it for anyone who has trouble sleeping.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game. I play it every chance I get. I really like the stationary cube. I have recommend it to all my family.
B009Y6231U|3.0|This is a decent movie for what it is.  I recall when I saw it first years ago - Kurtmovie Russel in the best shape of his life.  He has three or four lines in the entire movie.  IIRC, he said he'd never do something like again due to the rigorous movie prep.<br /><br />Overall the movie has an interesting premise.  An ok way to kill two hoursmo if you nothing else to do, or don't want to think too hard about the movie plot or character development.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I like this game . It is a  repeat of pipes tho. So if u don't care for pipes you won't like this either.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Diamond Dash gave you very limited free play.  I did not want to pay for more games, so I deleted it.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love the way the world is so real  I  am going to be able to play the game I am going to play it now
B008XG1X18|4.0|I view Pinterest online, but it is also fun to use the ap.  The only problem I have is that it is small on my Kindle, but you  can click on anything your interested in and view it a bit larger.  Haven't figured out changing boards yet, but I will.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|The author does an exhaustive analysis of countries around the world from history to the present day.  In his analysis he isolates two qualities that determine whether the nation with either fail or succeed.  This book should be mandatory reading for everyone in the political science field and those wanting to know more about the &#34;why's&#34; of national failures.  Our current politicians at the local, state, and federal level could ensure success by insuring the two qualities identified by Acemoglu exist in their legislation.  This book was wonderfully refreshing and the author's research was extensive.  Well worth the read.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel ap is great.  Over the weekend we had severe weather and I could check our forecast and warnings without turning on the TV.  It even gave the warnings and watches for our area.
0345803507|5.0|Loved the book for the story more than the sex.  Great writer and would love to read more books with lots of romance not necessarily detailed sex.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Didn't get a chance to start from season one until recently. Glad i did. Although, at times, scenes seem a smidgen overacted (Think Wm. Shatner) I'm hoping this being the first season the characters will continue to develop & coalesce. Being a fan of the genre I am thoroughly enjoying the series. It is what it is & with that in mind, I'm looking forward to more Falling Skies!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the series and can't wait to watch each episode.  It is so interesting to see the evolution of the characters, both in personality and in dress.  Although I really want to know their secrets since the show has covered 8 years in time yet nobody has aged a bit.
0230016855|4.0|For explaining change management challanges, Kotter has created this lean and simple story, thus explaining most of the challanges that will be faced.<br />I will certainly recommend this piece, as it offers a simple to discuss content for leaders dealing with change management.
0451232852|5.0|If you like WWI historical fiction, this is the book for you. I couldn't put it down, It was great.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The book provides great insights into the presidency from a perspective we would otherwise not see. I strongly recommend it.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Finished the first four volumes a few weeks ago and A Dance with Dragons picks up where the earlier volumes leaves off, never missing a beat.
0307730700|4.0|What is it like to be a member of an elite fighting force and still maintain your faith? What is it like to face danger, and not back down? Is it possible for God to take someone with a bad past and change them? Eric Blehm writes about someone like this in Fearless.<br /><br />Written about Adam Brown, a member of the top group of Navy SEALs, Fearless takes you on Adam's journey from a young and daring kid, through his days of drugs, into his salvation and getting passed his addiction. It tells (what it can that isn't classified) about his life becoming and being a SEAL.<br /><br />Eric Blehm interviewed many people, from family to friends to team members, to get a complete picture of the life of Adam Brown. From childhood stories, to the trouble he got into, and into how he joined the elite Navy Seals and went on missions overseas, Blehm tells a complete story of what Adam Brown lived through and for. Through Fearless, we get an idea of what Adam Brown went through, but also how he put others first. He was always ready to push on, even when hurt, so that those around him could succeed.<br /><br />Well written and very thorough, Fearless lets you see an example of facing large odds and relying on Christ to get you through, even if you do not survive. Adam Brown stayed faithful even in death. One issue I don't like is the full curse words use in the book. I know that they are direct quotes, but I wish that all of them had been blanked out, not just a few of them.<br /><br />I received this book from Waterbrook Multnomah in exchange for this review.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|Every now and then Joe puts out a brilliant album that's fun to listen to from beginning to end.  This isn't that album.<br />Heavy on keyboard.  Good, but not Great.  My favorites are Surfing with the Alien, The Extremist, Joe Satriani (self-titled), and Super Colossal just for a frame of reference.
B00795P4EG|1.0|Rip off. I'm a webmaster. Very proficient in Photoshop. Thought I could save time buying TouchRetouch.

B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a pretty good little game. I have passed away many hours (in which I could have chosen to be productive) playing it. I would reccomend it if you have nothing better to do.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I've always been a Batman fanatic, and these movies were not a disappointment. I love the action and suspense. Nolan definitely won me over with these! The only complaint I have is that the 3rd ends in a MAJOR cliff hanger and there will not be a 4th!
0062082353|5.0|What an example of an American Warrior. Great Warrior! I am glad he knew Jesus Christ as His Lord and Savior. What a Soldier of Christ! It is a shame that a nut case coward shot him or was he paid by Muslim terrorist?l
B006N0YWGY|4.0|This is a pretty straight forward game. Good graphics. Controls are a little weak. Its still a cool game. Worth a look.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|We all remember that day vividly.  The author's fantasy adds to its stress and horror in an eerily haunting tale..
B0063M22QO|4.0|Well done.  Easy to run the table.  A better version that previous versions that I have tried.  Keep up the good work.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very addicting game.This is not to mention very changing back grounds, but the format to where the trains are never changes. But with the increasing speeds as you advanced keeps your attention and make scoring more difficult even if you memorize some of the formats.
B00821PCJS|4.0|This is by no means the best show on TV, but it is interesting and engaging. While the plot is not overly original, and the characters are a bit stereotypical, it manages to keep my interest in spite of it. I will definitely keep watching.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun,free,exiting and hard is fun to play on the kindle fire it is the best game ever
1609611543|5.0|What an eye opener. We applied the principles and weight loss became easily feasible. We found this book to be very helpful in supplementing our health, medical, psychology and weight loss library. It is well written and informative as a reference as well.

1400069289|5.0|The Power of Habit:Why We Do What We Do In Life and Business by Charles Duhigg is an<br />important book about the impact of habits on individuals, organizations and even entire<br />movements of people. The book explains how habits work, how to create new habits by<br />introducing craves and the mechanics of why our habits change. Examples of classic craves<br />are set forth like Starbuck's coffee and others.<br /><br />Generally speaking, habit cues are governed by other peoples' behavior at a specific location<br />and time. Prior emotions are often another important component of a habit. Companies like<br />Target can manipulate consumer habits through frequent consumer preference surveys which<br />point toward simple and obvious cues for inspiring consumers to purchase a product on<br />impulse.<br /><br />Duhigg provides practical examples of how and why people internalize habits. For example,<br />people go to gyms for a human connection and not necessarily exercise on a treadmill alone.<br />The author explains how organizations develop a memory from unwritten rules on how to get<br />things done. Organizations of every size and shape study the behavior of customers to be<br />able to predict future sales and the demand for an individual product.<br /><br />The author explains how to extinguish bad habits. First, people must have a strong will to<br />believe that they can change in order to develop the momentum to move a difficult agenda item forward. In moving forward, small wins represent the steady application of a small advantage<br />which people develop incrementally until a complete change can be accomplished.<br /><br />The Power of Habit by Duhigg is an excellent resource on how to move forward a difficult<br />agenda through the maze of resistance which plaques even the best organizations.<br /><br />First Published on Blogcritics

B00B2DSK06|5.0|I have watched this 5 times over now and it never gets boring! Exciting naming all the games and watching what they will do next!
0440246318|2.0|Some  very exciting passages.  But the characters' loyalties are shifting and indistinct, and the object of their search is never clear.  People die indiscriminately for no defined cause. We never discover what all the dying was about, and everything grows more and more confused, until the end is incomprehensible.  I wonder if the author understands it?
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Amazing performances by Lawrence, Cooper and Deniro.  A bit slow at first, but overall a really good movie.  If you have lived with someone who has bipolar disease, this will seem very familiar.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story is interesting enough but misses the special character of Mr Housseini's first two books which were rivetting. The present book jumps from events to locations and leaves the reader guessing what's going on.<br />I feel it is an intricate story that would have needed to be more elaborate in certain parts. The ending would allow a second part. Summarizing  still worthwhile reading.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Interesting read.  The three stories intertwined made me keep reading to find out what happened in each and how they worked with one another. Time flew reading this book.
B005MLP8E0|5.0|They just don't make movies like this one any more.  It is definitely worth your time if you've never seen it.
0060873027|2.0|I'm a longtime fan of Michael Crichton's writing, and this is quite possibly the worst of his books. (Even worse than &#34;Next&#34; -- and that's saying something.)  The characters are flat and 2-dimensional, and the premise was ridiculous. &#34;Honey I Shrunk the Kids&#34; was more believable. I don't know how much of this was Michael's writing and how much was Richard Preston's, but I have to believe it was Preston's fault so as not to be sorely disappointed with my favorite author.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|The characters drift aimlessly between rotten to the core and salt of the earth.  I found it completely contrived when any given character fell from grace or redeemed themselves.  The final episode was such a departure from the tone, look and feel of the rest of the season, that I was constantly waiting for some big reveal that it was a dream sequence and a character would be ripped back to the dark, &#34;dank reality&#34; of the asylum.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. I feel like I'm stretching my brain when I play. My daughter enjoys playing with me and husband too. More levels please!
B000ZPBPX6|5.0|My earlier pairs of Crocs started with lots of traction but when they got older the bottoms became smooth and slick. Walking on a wet surface they became like sliding on ice. This model has two great features I really like: 1- they have a great non-skid sole, way better than other Crocs; 2- while they look similar to other models, they DO NOT have holes around the front & sides, so they keep out water, mud, etc. when I wear them for gardening.
0553386794|5.0|Had to send the first one back as it had about 100 pages in the middle of the book with a large cut.  As I turned the pages It was not on the print, but was  afraid it would tear the page.  I returned it and Amazon shipped another within a few days.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|It's a real puzzle of a legal thriller; the evidence is murky.  One parent is in denial about the child; the other parent too much in reality.  It keeps you guessing throughout the story right up until the end.The mother and father's personalities are described in detail, but their son Jacob's description is murky; but probably necessarily so to camouflage the story's ending.  The tale is gripping.  But the the family is just one on-going tragedy.  Even though one may not like the story, it is impossible  to put down before finishing the book..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game for building your mind. Also a great game for the competitive person. Can't wait for the add-ons. Fun for the whole family.

B00APACSJG|5.0|Another solid good read by Bujold.<br /><br />At the start of this one you have no earthly idea what the hells going on.<br /><br />Miles is in a tunnel in the dark. He's been drugged. He's escaped from his druggers and is in deep dark tunnel filled with frozen units full of corpses. The line both sides of the hallway.<br /><br />Jeeze. What a way to start a story.<br /><br />Miles does get out and a young boy helps him get back to the Barrayaran consulate. Once there he starts trying to figure out what the hells going on. Who the hell would try to kidnap him and why??<br /><br />He along with Roice, his ever present Armsman, are there for a symposium on cryogenics. Of course Gregor has sent them there so Miles figures there are big fat rats in the crygenictss world. Boy is he right.<br /><br />Just another good tale with  Miles, Roice and the consulate staff figuring it out with the help of the willing and not so willing.<br /><br />The end was a heartbreaker though. If you've followed Miles from the first book then you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Of course it had to come. Just wish it were a little bit further into the future though. Miles and his friends will definetly be missing that very, very good man. I know I sure as hell will.<br /><br />Five stars and then some.

B008602KQI|5.0|A better ending: They eat the berries and all of the districts erupt into total riots. The ending in this movie only ensures there will be more hunger games in the future, but if they eat the berries, then the future of the tyranny is threatened. After this ending life just goes on, they return to District 12, nothing changes, but by eating the berries the whole order is threatened and the order is exposed.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Gideon ♥♥♥ Gideon ♥♥♥ Gideon ♥♥♥Gideon<br /><br />♥Love the Crossfire Series ♥<br /><br />Sylvia Day's writing is exquisite, raw and authentic. Sylvia Day is one of my favorite top five authors of all time; it's clear her books resonate for their intense eroticism and sexiness.<br /><br />Quote:<br /><br />\\"Gideon cupped my face in his hands and kissed me, our flavors mingling. \\"Thank you. \\"What are you thanking me for? You did all the work.\\" \\"There's no work involved in f***ing you, angel.\\" His slow smile was pure satiated male. \\"I'm grateful for the privilege.\\"I sank back onto my heels. \\"You're killing me. You can't be that gorgeous and sexy and say stuff like that. It's overload. It fries my brain. Sends me into a meltdown.\\"His smile widened and he kissed me again.<br />\\"I know the feeling.\\"<br />~ Sylvia Day, Entwined with You<br /><br />Eva in this third installment grows, as a character she is powerful, mature and much stronger then she was in the previous two books. I found this to be refreshing and sassy. Gideon. Oh man... He is still possessive, commanding, gorgeous and sexy as hell mogul. The story was at a much slower pace out of the three books, but I think it was necessary to kinda slow things down. This book mainly focuses on Eva and Gideon's relationship you can feel them as they are learning to trust and sincerely appreciate their time together. The enormity of Eva and Gideon's love for one another magnifies page by page.<br /><br />Quote:<br /><br />\\"I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly. I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you. I want to hear you laugh and hold you when you cry. I want to sit next to you, breathe the same air, share the same life. I want to wake up to you like this every day forever. I want you.\\"<br />~ Sylvia Day, Entwined with You<br /><br />This book is simply poetic - beautiful. It has real emotion and great depth.<br /><br />You need to have read Bared To You and Reflected In You prior to Entwined With You to understand this book. Both of which are equally as awesome.<br /><br />\\"If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would be inextricably entwined.\\" ~Sylvia Day<br />[[ASIN:B008UCJ7KO Entwined with You (A CROSSFIRE NOVEL)]]
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Have always been a big fan of Columbo. I often would be disappointed on those rare occasions the series was reran because it seemed as though I would always miss my most favorite episodes. Now I can view what I want when it is convenient to me. Quality DVDs. Delivered within days.
B00CRS88IO|4.0|This was one of the better books that I have read by a new author in a while. I wasn't sure about it at first because I don't usually read World War 2 thrillers but I feel that isn't a completely accurate description. Sure it reminded me of an old fashioned war movie but it was also infused with a hip worldliness which seemed appropriate given that the main character is the man who created the most famous bon vivant ever, Mr. James Bond a.k.a. 007. This is the story of 17F, intelligence officer in the Special Branch of the NID during World War 2. The book hews remarkably well to accuracy and it is obvious that Damian Stevenson knows far too much about Ian Fleming than is probably healthy. (The attention to detail really is intense at times and includes the exact brands of shaving cream Fleming favored, the exact clothes he wore, his gun (Police Positive), car (Buick, but also a Jaguar on loan from Ivar Bryce), the address of his flat in Belgravia and even how many cigarettes he smoked a day (70) and what type (`A blend of Balkan and Turkish hand rolled by Morland's with three little gold stripes round the filter like the rings on his uniform'). There is plently of action here too. In fact, most of the book reads like a combination of drawing-room drama and summer movie explosiveness. A bit of an unusual cross-genre hybrid but there's no denying the entertainment power. And it's not all just bells and whistles. Damian Stevenson knows how to write female characters and I think that's what makes this book more than just a Robert Ludlum wannabee. Denise Astier is a fantastic creation and is the kind of woman I like, tough and doesn't care what anyone thinks, especially men. She's her own person. There is a scene between her and Fleming in the ski lodge where they consummate their growing attraction that reads as good as anything in the best romance novels. I admit to welling up at the brilliant ending which I won't spoil but it was moving, emotional and a cool little twist. This book has a little something for everybody and I can't wait till the next one in the series.
1452101248|5.0|Great instructions to follow and photos are very helpful too. I will recommend this book and &#34;Jerusalem&#34; to others too.
B00CEF014E|4.0|`Solstice' is the first book by Damian Stevenson author of `The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada' and it's a good one. The story has a clever hook: A girl with a slight background of mental illness (a bout of serious depression and a bipolar 2 diagnosis) tells everyone that her boyfriend is missing only no one - including the reader - has seen this person. Little by little the details pile up so that it seems that she has made the whole thing up. A sort of cross between crying wolf and paranoid delusions. But there's a sliver of doubt that makes us think he might be real, that maybe, just maybe she is telling the truth and maybe it's all a diabolical plot to make her lose her mind. I won't spoil the ending but suffice to say you will be clicking your Kindle furiously to find out the answer! I stayed up late to finish this awesome gem of a thriller. I have enjoyed both of Stevenson's books now, both were complete page turners and in different genres too which is impressive. There's not many good books like this out there and I was very pleased with my 99c purchase. `Solstice' is recommended for anyone who enjoys thrillers and horrors and stories about alternative lifestyles or cults even. A great read!

B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|We were told what a cute children's movie this was, but after viewing on Amazon VOD, we were VERY disappointed; actually disgusted. The crude and vulgar language used from the beginning to the end, ruined the movie. This is NOT what we want to teach our children, no matter how commendable the moral of the story is. Glad we viewed it before wasting the money to buy it.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I could care less for the religious theme. had no bearing on my reveiw.  I got this because the art work looked original and the permissions were ok.  its a cute game. has a nice tutorial that takes you through all the challenges as you play.  the text was clever and fun. the gameplay smooth with no lag or mechanical problems.  the music during combat was engaging but the only negative I found was the tutorial music made me want to get a screwdriver and poke my ears out. a single horn.  ...maybe a picalo playing a riff over and over and over.  at. every. stage. grrrrr<br /><br />regardless a clever and fun app though not my style of game. I hate timed challenges and stressful apps but others that like these types games will enjoy this.  you basically swipe your finger and shake the device to aviod baddies and herd goodies into a safe area thru hazardous waves.

It would make more sense to add several inches to accommodate more bottles, in my case glass jars and bottles. Having said that, the solution I apply is to take full bag out and put aside (garage, car )and start collecting in a new bag ( by the way fitting beautifully in a bin).<br />Overall it is a classy sorter, the best on a market.

Ms. Skloot  humanizes science--presenting a story that addresses human, biological, racial and sociological issues in a page-turning epic.  I was brought to tears several times, and the book stays with you.  I was happy to hear that the Lacks family is involved in the television production of the book and I am eagerly awaiting Ms Skloot's and their collaboration with Oprah to bring this to life.  What an important story!
B00BCSBU4E|5.0|In 1947 Archiv became the early music imprint of Deutsche Grammophon as the great German label began its postwar expansion. Music was one of the few bright spots during those bleak years. Luckily, the new long-playing vinyl format and several new recording technologies such as magnetic tape and highly accurate omnidirectional microphones coincided with that postwar expansion. This new era yielded a distinguished series of influential recordings, as well as fostering a burst of scholarship in early music performance practices. Many of the seminal recordings included in this collection were revelatory in their own day, leading to a spectacular increase in the number of recordings of the Renaissance, Baroque and early Classical musical eras. Composers such as Vivaldi, Corelli and even Bach were poorly understood (and in Vivaldi's case almost unknown) until the post-war years. Archiv's influence over the years has been incalculable. This collection is merely an overview but it is a substantial one.<br /><br />The set begins with Helmut Walcha's celebrated recordings of Bach's organ music that were made in 1947. Two 1952 recordings of Bach cantatas under Fritz Lehmann follow. They feature a youthful Fischer-Dieskau and Karl Ristenpart. The second of the two Bach cantata recordings, a disc of Gregorian Chant and a riveting 1953 performance of 13th and 14th century music performed by Pro Musica Antiqua, are the vanguard of several recordings in this collection that are new to CD. The complete Bach Brandenburg Concertos performed by the Konzertgruppe der Schola Cantorum Basiliensis directed by August Wenzinger, released in 1953 and also new to CD, are a fascinating example of the nascent early music movement. They are believed to be the first recordings of the concertos that were played on original instruments. Music by Gibbon and Morley recorded in 1955 and performed by the Ensemble Der Schola Cantorum Basiliensis directed by Wenzinger is next. Richter's heavily romanticized 1958 stereo recording of Bach's St. Matthew Passion and a disc of his lush versions of Bach cantatas recorded in 1959 follow. Baroque composers such as Biber, Delalande, Muffat, Isaac, Mouret, Telemann, C.P.E. Bach, Handel, Purcell, Scarlatti, Monteverdi and Rameau are all represented. Many of these recordings were firsts of their kind and represented a profound metamorphosis from Richter's Romantic versions of this music to a new, leaner and more (theoretically) accurate historically informed vision.<br /><br />Several of this box set's recordings are now quite ubiquitous and may already occupy space in your collection. The Bach Mass in B Minor conducted by John Eliot Gardiner, his Mozart piano concertos 18 & 19 performed by Malcolm Bilson, his Monteverdi Vespro della Beata Vergine and Beethoven symphonies nos. 5 & 6, can all be found here. Trevor Pinnock's Vivaldi Four Seasons (one of the finest ever recorded), his Haydn Sturm und Drang symphonies nos. 39, 41, 48 and 65, and his Handel Op. 6 concertos nos. 9-12 are also included. Reinhard Goebel's wonderful recordings of Telemann's Wassermusik & 2 Bl&auml;serkonzerte are also in this set. Some of the collection's highlights are Paul McCreesh's brilliant Music for San Rocco and his superb Handel's Messiah. Also included are Marc Minkowski's Rameau Une symphonie imaginaire, his Handel La Resurrezione and several Italian Cantatas sung by Magdalena Kozena, some of Handel's most beautiful music that unfortunately remains little known. H&auml;ndel's Alcina directed by Alan Curtis is one of the finest Baroque opera recordings ever released. It too resides in this collection. If you do not own any of these recordings then this box set represents a treasure trove. If you only own a few it is still worth the purchase price, given the number of fine recordings that are included.<br /><br />The sound quality of the releases in the collection are variable, of course, with the mono recordings sounding surprisingly full and rich though slightly compressed through modern playback equipment. The early stereo recordings, made in the late 1950s, occasionally sound a bit bright and artificial, as engineers attempted to take advantage of the new format's many inherent attributes: such as a deeper and wider soundstage and more realistic imaging. Not all of the experiments were entirely successful but none of the recordings are less than good. As one would expect, the newer recordings are quite vivid with a pleasingly spacious and more accurate soundstage and a characteristic \\"bite\\" to the sound of the original instruments that brings them to life: especially when heard through quality headphones.<br /><br />By listening to this entire collection, you will bear witness to the spectacular growth in post-war understanding of early music and the way it ought to sound. Many of our era's advances in knowledge of early music's remarkably different performance methods began here, with these very recordings. This collection is a time capsule, at the very least, of an exciting period in which music that was once poorly understood - and even more poorly performed - became the basis for some of the greatest classical recordings ever made.<br /><br />Mike Birmanich though slightly compressed through modern playback equipment.

B00CWVFZ8W|2.0|This could've been a great movie. Too many shallow explanations and no character backgrounds. Just not enough information to make you care about the plot and characters.

I haven't run across anything yet that I couldn't solve simply by paying more attention to the<br />details and double checking things if needed.<br /><br />A real great game that's relaxing and a real pleasure to play!<br /><br />What am I missing on Lvl 5? I can only get about half of the Lvov done.  Any help souled be appreciated!! Thanks so very much!!

0142405809|5.0|Outstanding children's story.  A snail, a whale, adventures, home, friends.  What more could you realistically ask for in a book you will read out loud one million times?
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Love it,  perfect for all ages. The short learning curve makes it a worthy challenge to get used to the sensitive steering.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|A show where characters aren't predictable and one dimensional is a relief. American Horror Story delivered in season one and evolved even farther ahead of other shows season two. It's exciting and sometimes heartbreaking to see characters bend and break under the various stresses of the Asylum. I think this season ties up all the story lines better than season one and found the storyline overall more enjoyable (though perhaps season one had better individual episodes). As stated, cast is great, writing is great, premise is fun. And each season is compact and independent so you don't have to keep up with long multi-year story lines. Watch this show!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book is no different than the rest of the Game of Thrones series, it keeps me wanting to read more. Just wish George would quit killing off the main characters and get on with the books.  It's hard to keep all the characters straight when he keeps killing of the leads and replacing them with new characters.  Makes you wonder if George is having a hard time keeping everyone straight and just kills them when it gets too confusing and starts over.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|this app is so confusing I can not make heads nor tails on how to use it.  it is useless and not useable.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is simply a very well written show with engaging characters. One gets drawn in and wants to know more.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|This movie is the must have/see for all closet romantics, drama lovers and would-be performers.  All movies should be judged accorded to this level of excellence!  Imagine the perfect balance of acting, writing, jokes, wisecracks, intrigue, hatred and desperation and you have Casablanca!  In my estimation (and I am a huge movie fan, both old and new), this is the perfect result of what hard work and dedication will bring to the screen.  I have seen this well over forty times in my life and I hope to see this at least a few times more before they call me to that great balcony in the sky (and if you get showered with popcorn from above, that me!).  Make your teenage kids see it, make yourselves see it......just see it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read all of Kaled Hosseini's books and I enjoy his writing style very much.  His ability to make his characters and their lifestyle come alive is consistently great.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Tighter, more action-packed than Game of Thrones and just as good. I'm glad History Channel renewed it for a second season, as well as given the time, money, and freedom to the team to create a riveting show, for all 9 episodes.
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|The free version ends on day 13.  I do not want to purchase it so it is just a tease.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|It was selling at a good price so I downloaded it. I'm impressed that they keeping putting out good albums.
B009LGO88E|3.0|The CPP is very good quality, the buttons are excellent, and it snaps on to the 3DS XL fine.<br /><br />But it is just too big, and I am already so used to playing Monster Hunter without it, it just gets in the way.<br />I can see that Nintendo was trying to make an ergonomic unit here, the back does have nice handles indentations, but it just adds too much bulk to the system.<br />I am a big guy and have large hands, so I thought the add bulk would be nice, but it does not work for me. I cannot image small Japanese people using the CPP comfortably.<br />Also it is kind of a pain to use, you have to go into menus to get it set up to work with Monster Hunter, then if you do not use the CPP later, it goes through this long process of disconnecting the CPP and if you want to use it again, you have to go through the menus again. Why can it not just be activated once and work whenever you feel like using it, without having to go through the menus every time.<br /><br />The 3DS XL should have had a second analog stick built in, but if you really need the second stick, this product works, if you can handle the extra bulk.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I loved everyone of the music tracks on all the Twilight music releases with the exception of the last film - mostly repeats.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Did not work, would not download, would not install, Kindle Fire really needs a native Youtube app. But they will not get one, because Amazon blocks Prime Instant Video, from other Android products.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Having lived in Paris for quite a while I enjoyed revisiting.  I am not usually a fan of either Woody Allen or Owen Wilson but they both did great in this film  I loved the charm and nostalgia of another age and Owen Wilson was perfect as the somewhat bumbling and out of step American who finds himself.  Lovely movie
B00D2K40WY|5.0|daughter loves it! its the best game &amp; she says she is going to play it over &amp; over again
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating because it helped me find the definition of hard words I had to know for school. The New Oxford American Dictionary is very helpful!!!  THANK YOU!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The only reason I gave the book a 4 and not a 5 is due to some climatic issues. But this book is what I call the intelligent mans Zombie novel. A must read just be prepared to read testimonials from survivors and not a straight forward plotted novel.
034580404X|5.0|Heard enough about it so I had to order it!  It was a great price thru Amazon & the series CERTAINLY lived up to my expectations!  Can't wait for the movie!
B00ADS90EQ|3.0|I liked the movie, but the vomiting scenes were particularly gross.  Funny, but so incredibly gross.  Gack!  The characters were hysterical.  Too &#34;Glee&#34; in some parts.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The plotting is intricate and effectively acted by a talented stable of actors occasionally augmented by well known stars.  The series offers insight into how intelligent, successful people can manage to mess up both their public and private lives; oftentimes drawing on real life news reports.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This movie made me laugh, cry and cheer.  Bradley Cooper did an amazing job as did Robert De Niro.  Excellent movie.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Extremely well acted, and the script itself keeps you on the edge of your seat for the full season.  This dramatized view of politics at the highest level certainly contains some intriguing lessons  &#34;plottin' and scheming.&#34;
B008393Q2O|4.0|I love this app.  I have tons of lists and notes for everything.  Any time I think of something that I want to remember, I just pull out my phone and make a note.  I have my grocery and other shopping lists saved on this app.  I have them all color coded.  My only issue is this: You have the option to organize the lists by edit date, so the list you just modified should be at the top.  This works sometimes, but sometimes my lists are in the wrong order.  A list that I modified weeks ago will be at the top, while the one I just added something to will be at the bottom.  Other than that, I love this app.
B00BCMT4RA|4.0|If you love the Blues, you'll love this classic Blues Album. If the phrase &#34;hard luck and trouble&#34; means anything to you, you'll be able to relate.  With a solid rhythm section, tasty, understated guitar work and smooth vocals backed by a polished horn section, songs like  &#34;Crosscut Saw&#34; , &#34;Kansas City&#34;,  and &#34;I Almost Lost my Mind&#34;, are presented by Albert King in a way that has been imitated but rarely equaled. This album presents a Master of the Blues making it sound easy, like anyone could do it. Many have tried but few have succeeded.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is an excellent writer. I have enjoyed all of his books. I loved &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; best but as this book evolved and I saw the relationship of each story to the others, I began to enjoy it even more.
B0085KGGHI|4.0|Muddy Waters was the real King of the Delta Blues. The Rolling Stones were and are his English offspring. This DVD is a record of what can best be described as a family reunion, and a tribute to the influence of this legendary blues man.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Well for those of us who have seen the original countless times, this one doesn't even come close to stacking up.  But if you go into it without any pre-conceived ideas, it is an entertaining movie, and Mila is hot, so that helps.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app it's not boring. It's so much fun. You would love it. And there are different towns. I love it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book soooo much it made me cry and i ask you to read it (spoilers) in honor of Augustus waters
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is very useful, but the other people that may use it are not the nicest. So be careful who your friends are because this site is extremely easy to spread rumours on.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|It kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved how two stories intertwined into one. Outstanding Mr.Rollins can't wait for the next adventure.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Cool game, better than other games out there. You need to fix the little lagging that ocurs when taking a turn.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a fun game. You get to raise your own horse, put it in to competitions. You can have your friends on it to talk to. And if you can't afford a real Gore's this is the way to go.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I a lot of fun playing. Really kind of had me puzzled a few times. NOTHING like that HORRIBLE elevator game.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is so awesome I can't Copland it an the dragons are awesome and you can breed your own dragon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best horse app I have ever had! Great graphics and love the horse competitions! I like the quests from the stable boy, the assistant, and Tiffany! I am working for uncle Hectors horse. 3 more medals!<br /><br />FYI- i am SaturnsHeart on the game. Friend me!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|At first I thought the game would be dull. It is far from it. The puzzles and the three dimensional graphics combine to make this the best game I have played.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I ENJOYED THIS GAME. IT REALLY MAKES YOU THINK. THIS IS A GREAT FAMILY GAME. EVERYONE CAN HELP WITH THE ESCAPE.
B003THHIEM|4.0|Castle, Beckett and their cohorts make for some laugh out loud tv.  Fits both her and him for TV night.
B00445YMME|5.0|I really like that there is no laugh track. The pseudo/-doc style is like The Office - another show I enjoyed. Because I came so late to this series, I get to watch as many episodes as I like, one after the other, without having to wait for next week. The characters just grow on you. It is quite an endearing show.
044022425X|3.0|Okay, I will say, as has been said so many times, the original Outlander book was fantastic!!  It was exciting, and fun, and original, and funny, and intelligent.  It was a time travel (set in 1946 and 1773) adventure filled with intrigue; at it's center the soul-mate romance of James Fraser and Claire Randall.  I couldn't put it down.<br />The second book: Dragonfly in Amber was also wonderful.  Introducing Claire and Jamie's child as an adult back in 1969, and Claire telling her the tale of how she and Jamie tried to protect his people and stop the Scottish battle of Culloden.  And how, in the end, Jamie forced Claire to return to her time because they could not stop the deadly battle.  It was near as good as the first with all the fiery, intelligent dialogue and intense plot twists.<br />The third: Voyager.  Claire chooses to go back in time when she finds out Jamie didn't die at Culloden, but it's been 20 years.  They are different people, but they find they still love each other immensely, and can't be apart.  Again, almost as good as 1 and 2, but maybe a little less fun, a little more....unrealistic, perhaps.  Still somewhat fun, and hopeful at the end.<br />The fourth book: Drums of Autumn.......hmmm.......I agree with many reviews that this story lacked sufficient editing.  There were way too many times when the author went on and on and on about inconsequential stuff, like the surrounding woods (she did that a lot).  I realize a certain amount of description is necessary to put the reader in the moment, but it got tedious and a bit boring.  I did not mind, as some, that Jamie and Claire were trying to settle in the colonies.  Jamie even said, that he is 45 years old and should own a home and some land.  I agreed.  I was wondering when DG was going to relieve Claire and Jamie of their nomadic, penniless lifestyle; getting a bit too old for sleeping on the ground in the wilderness in the winter, I would think.  Also, Claire is a few years older than Jamie, and though money doesn't matter to her, a 48 year old woman wouldn't want to sleep outdoors perpetually.<br /><br />Their daughter Brianna and her boyfriend Roger are introduced more fully as they travel back in time to warn her parents of some great matter.  But neither character is flesh and bone, like Jamie and Claire, and some other recurring characters.  They are one dimensional and awkward, especially Roger.  Brianna was okay, a bit inmature, but.....just two dimensional.  And there are things that happened that were obvious plot movers, and not great ones.<br />AND last, but not least, the way Claire and her story were written bothered me; even in the third book.  We never hear enough of what she went through without Jamie.  It's all just superficial surfacey stuff.  Whereas Jamie's life, the 20 years without Claire, is rich and written almost ad nauseum.  Jamie had said he didn't think he wanted to know about her life with Frank, but that he was wrong, and Claire said, we'll talk later, but they never really do.  And while his past his sad and difficult and violent, and constantly being thrown in her face.  Claire's is BORING.  Yet when you hear certain snippets you realize it wasn't.  She's a woman surgeon for Pete's sake, in the 1950-60\\"s.  When she does tell a tale she sugar coats it so Jamie doesn't get upset.  Like when they spoke about how Frank treated her, and she NEVER mentions his many, many girlfriends and how that isolated her, and how that made her feel.  Well, if she did, I missed it.  And did Claire have an affair ever??  One couldn't blame her.<br /><br />Sometimes, honestly, DG writes so cryptically I have to read the dialogue over a few times, and even then I'm not sure I got the gist of it.  That gets worse as the books go on.  Even in the books when Jamie learns one tiny tidbit of her past he is floored that she was lonely or sad; letting us know Claire has never discussed these things with him.  That annoys me because I feel as if it's a 1950's, old fashioned wife thing to do, and Claire is more than that.  She wouldn't nurture Jamie's sensibilities so much.  And when the old Native American lady tells Claire this looooong story of a stranger that Claire is sure is another time traveler, we never hear of Jamie's reaction to this.  Isn't this an interesting piece of news or is time travel so common to the 18th century Highlander that he's yawning through the telling of such stories?  Hmmph!<br /><br />So, I don't know....this installment was a little incongruous, and with a few characters not so well fleshed out.  I liked parts of this installment, but I didn't love it.950's, old fashioned wife thing to do, and Claire is more than that.  She wouldn't nurture Jamie's sensibilities so much.

B00BN3EE1O|5.0|First I read the book several years ago but kind of missed it with the movie.  When I began viewing I realized I had read the book but watched to see how well it was translated to the cinima.  Excellent job.  The scoundrel was still evil and the &#34;ghost&#34; was well done.  I do believe if I had seen the movie first, I would not have &#34;got it&#34; as soon as I did in the book.
B00BURWSG6|5.0|Admittedly, I'm a huge Rob Rock fan, and it's the reason the disc caught my attention,.However, Timo's guitar is terrific, and all the other vocalists are stars in their own rights. Elize Ryd impressed me so that I also purchased two Amaranthe albums. If you like melodic metal, you'll love this album.
0307476073|5.0|This book review will not judge the personal actions of the author, but the value of the work. I have enjoyed the time I've spent with Strayed so much more than I anticipated based on some of the negative reviews. As many have stated, this is not a trail guide or a nature tale, but a belated coming of age journey. The author presents herself as an anti-hero -- young, admittedly self-destructive, and impetuous to the point of reckless. She even amazed herself at times that her own ignorance or ineptitude didn't kill her, on more than one occassion. This made Strayed's ambitious trek all the more interesting to me. I found her raw honesty kept me wondering how she might possibly trip herself up next, and then work her way out of the mess she made. I can't condone all of the author's life choices, but I am thankful she was brave enough to share them, even when they went really, really wrong. I found this read a worthwhile journey, indeed.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|This brings a new idea to what Hansel and Gretel did. At first I thought this was a flop and just a sad attempt at commercializing off old children stories. Well, if they commercialized its OK with me. I enjoyed this movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Always interesting to watch. Not particularly happy with some character developments, but I'll live. Looking forward to Season 4. Should be fun.
B0045DO8LK|1.0|Are you people insane? This is garbage! The only song PJ ever did that was good was \\"Last Kiss\\" and that's because they didn't write it. They should do more covers!<br />Had this group been around in the very creative & competitive 1960s & 70s, they would have never got a recording contract. It's that simple, they're no good.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I never and still do not watch soap operas.  But this series keeps up on the net, text, and phone to discuss what is going on at Downton Abbey.  What a hoot it has been over the three seasons to keep up with this eclectic family.  It is impossible to &#34;relate&#34; on a realistic level, emotional yes, to this titled family that is historically removed from us even if by a few generations.  I appreciated the set design and costume work.  So many elements make this a viewing event.
B008RXYOKY|3.0|I did not need it and I sent it back.  I do not know how to get rid of the request for a review other than to give one.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The best show on TV.. Not happy some characters will be gone when it comes back for session 4 in Jan
B004ADF7RO|4.0|a great film. Kid safe and something those adult that saw it growing up will enjoy. Safe for the whole family.
0739378341|5.0|Excellent read...kept me till the very end. Another great John Grisham book. I also liked the large print - which I accidentally bought but it made reading easier.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife said her friends really loved this and she should watch it. Since I am the one of the two of us who knows how to use the smart TV apps, I got her started. I hung around for a couple of minutes and started to enjoy it myself. I thought the story would be too stuffy but it's not. It is an interesting period piece, well acted and with just enough intrigue to make you want to watch the next episode! It is something like this that makes PRIME worthwhile.
B008J34466|5.0|Going to see her in October because this CD is so good.  Highly recommend it but there is quite a bit of adult language, so turn it off or down around the kids.
0684824906|4.0|This is an interesting good book.  It is not an easy to read book.  It has a lot of great facts and insight into the political history of the time.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The best show on TV.. love everyone on it especially Anna, Mr. Bates, Matthew and the rest of the cast..
B001KX50BK|5.0|I know I used to have a copy of this and when I went to look for it was gone. Well, better for me as I upgraded to the blu-ray version. I love this movie and it's one of my go to movies. :-)
B0091REZMW|4.0|i dont like that you need to have friends to continue playing other levels. other than that the game is great.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great cast, fantastic intriguing storyline, cant wait for season 3 to being in a few weeks. Hope it will be on Prime video soon after.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|Very stupid game it looked fun but it wasn't so I  Deleted it Was a waste of time for me
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|None of my questions were answered felt like I learned nothing more about this story.  I wasted money on this book.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|You are getting what you pay for. It is OK. Would I recomend it? Probably, yes for the amount of money you paying.
1400052181|5.0|i love this book! very few books capture my interest and this book was one of them. Although it was recommended  for my college to read, i'm happy i chose to read it. it is very educational to those who are studying anything related to science (medicine, biology,etc.) i highly recommend this book for anyone. very easy reading.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love science fiction and this looks as a good series. Just saw 4 episodes but already hooked to see all.....
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|this seris gets better each time I read it, I would recommend this to everyone.  it is great reading, romantic, hot and very fulfilling
B009FZFONO|5.0|Never thought I would be watching a  show about zombies, but I'm hooked!  It is a compelling drama that keeps you wanting more.
B004GFN11A|1.0|I was looking forward to using this app. it won't let me log on with my self hosted blog. the screen just keeps shaking at me. I would love some help on this as I wanted to use this app.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|A whole new chapter in the story of Ender, Speaker for the Dead is a slower more philosophical book.  When I first read it, long ago, it didn't hold my attention as well because it didn't have the same fast paced action.  No, Speaker is a deep and interesting story filled with new characters and new worlds.  More of a mystery drama than the action packed Ender's Game...
B008OM0EDO|3.0|What can you say about Sasha Baron Chen?  You know going in that there is going to be some really crude stuff to deal with and normally  I don't like &#34;toilet humor&#34; but SBC makes it  funny!  I can't explain it but I think his movies are funny and I liked it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really fun game. Its kind of like 100 floors but with more mini games and different things to do.
B0031R5K68|4.0|Cannot fail to be good when Robert Langdon is again called to fight those who believe they are the chosen ones. Great novel, excellent twists and the same winning formula again!!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|There has been a great deal of work done on these episodes to bring them up to Blu-Ray level and it shows.  The special effects have been re-done using current technology, but the original effects are also available for purists and the curious.  In any event, the shows have been cleaned up and a new high-def transfer made.  Extras from earlier editions are here along with some new ones.  Definitely worth a look, especially if you can get it on sale.
0765365278|5.0|I just finished my paperback copy last night, it's one of those books that you just have to finish once you get down to 100 pages or so.<br /><br />I'm typically more of a sci-fi reader and have found a lot of fantasy to either be derivative of Tolkien or an immersive world with poorly imagined characters.  Not so with The Way of Kings, (spoiler alert) no dancing elves or gruff dwarves here.  Fantastic setting AND great characters.  Sanderson doesn't try to overwhelm you with a huge Dramatis Personae or an overabundance of made-up words/language (there is some, but it's fine).  Like most great stories, the characters drive the plot, not the other way around.  One major plot point wasn't particularly surprising (and welcome), the others were quite a surprise at the end.  The author definitely lined things up well for book #2.  With the follow-up novel not due for 6 months there is a strong likelihood I will re-read this massive tome after Christmas!<br /><br />My advice is to either dog-ear the map pages in the book, or find some place online you can print a copy of the maps and keep them handy.  You will need them!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game for my android phone. I'm so glad it is finally available for my kindle fire. Awesome app never a dull moment
B005G5PPGS|5.0|This book was so much more than the movie!  If you are not into baseball statistics, I would stick with the movie as this book goes into great detail on Bean's logic and stats used to make his decisions.
B009R659L8|5.0|A true Mary Higgins Clark mystery!  I rate it A 10. This is a must read for all mystery lovers
B005LAIIMG|4.0|My wife and I saw the movie this afternoon and were both impressed. The casting and acting were solid. Pitt did a great job in the lead role as Jerry. The girl who played the Isralie soldier was also very good. Zombies, well played and frightful. Story line developed nicely. Special effects 5 stars. I just wish they had answered a couple of simple and fairly basic questions in the process. First, what is the Zombies motivation to attack and bite humans? It isn't hunger since they don't eat anyone. It doesn't seem to be general anger and rage as other than biteing, they are essentially non destructive to other animals or the physical world around them. Big question: Why do they bite everyone? What is their motivation? As they are mindless - it isn't to keep propogating the infection (they aren't thinking that deeply). I wish that question had been answered. Question 2, as they are dead, why don't they decompose? I'll admit I'm not a Zombie geek, but it would seem normal that their bodies would decompose as they are dead and other bodily functions have ceased. For these and a couple of other unanswered questions, I have to take one star off and give it four instead of five.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I'll inaccurately describe it as The Gunslinger meets Harry Potter, though not a book for kids.  Eagerly awaiting Day 3
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I lost the book and I wanted to continue reading so I bought it on Kindle very good book important enough to replace it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I could not wait to get Entwined to you. I have been waiting months. When i first started reading the book i was excited because the 2nd book left you in a state of shock. however once i got into the book it was nothing like the first two books. it seemed like the spark that made the first two books in the series was gone, it also seemed like this book was a set up for the next book that i am not sure if anyone knew was coming. i would say you need to read this book because it answers questions from the second book but it does not give you the same reactions as the first two in the series. Gideon became so soft in this book not his normal powerful self. i want the old Gideon back hopefully in the fourth book he will re-appear.
B002PJN59M|5.0|I've watched this movie for years since it first came out. There are some slow scenes and some fun scenes in this movie. But overall an exciting movie that deals with power, deceit, trickery, betrayal and magic. I'm a big fan of mid evil times and this movie Excalibur for me rates at the top. I can imagine Nigel Terry having a lot of fun directing this film.<br /><br />Stan
B008602KQI|2.0|It was basically a waste of time. I only watched it because there is so few newer movies available to stream for free for Prime members.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|The movie was rather disjointed. There is little character development and no real compelling story. Most of the films in the series are exciting and thought provoking. This one is not.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Every episode is interesting nail biting and sit at the edge of your seat exciting. Must watch the whole series to keep up. Great acting by Mr. Cranston and others on the cast.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I love this movie. I bought this as a surprise gift for one of my sisters. She also loves this movie. It is a wonderful movie. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Great movie--best Bond actor since Sean Connery. I LOVE Judi Dench! Did she decide she's getting to old to play M???
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Very well written.  The writer knows how to build intrest in her work. It is worth rreading! A real page turner.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. The rooms are pretty neat and the clues are not that hard, although I must confess I did ask for help near the end. Very addicting and entertaining!
B000RUAR5G|5.0|A few fifth grade boys really enjoyed it on the bus during their field trip - check out the Micheal's &#34;special stuff&#34; scene.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|Sure many people thought she blew it on SNL. If you listen to her singing and her albums most of you will fall in love with her unconventional songwriting and singing. I l love to listen to her.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Flowery, English countryside prose with surprising twists.  You'll never guess the ending.  Take this on your travels wherever you go this summer.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nothing fancy, but it's free and it does what's promised. Great free app for the Kindle, I'd highly recommend this app!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|It'll was truly the last good flash game of our era, but it is still a great app.  My only complaint is that it is much harder to squish the sheep on the touch version.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|It wasn't as much action and suspense as I thought it would me.  Wasn't as scary as I thought it would be kinda dragged out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I log into Pinterest every single day.  It is a great way to get recipe ideas, to dream about your future home, to get workout ideas and decorating ideas.  There are so many options.  Basically, Pinterest is inspiring.
B0049MAXQG|5.0|Don't know why, but no one's been able to match this classic horror film.<br />The combination of religion, vulgarity, and disgust is shocking and terrifying. I watched this when it first came out in the 70's and I was disturbed for weeks!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It does exactly what I need it to do - just plug it into my computer & it's a go!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I don't understand why so many claim this to be Silvia Day's worst novel. The characters grow beyond their petty drama and begin their first step toward a happy living- together. People wanted continued arguments and fights between Eva and Gideon, pretty much an exact replica of book 2. But I for one, am happy with what she did with this book. I was squealing and awwing throughout the whole thing, and enjoyed reading about Eva getting over her insecurities and about Gideon manning up and accepting he has to give up some control to be with Eva fully. I loved every second of this book and can't wait for the next one!!!
0545123291|4.0|Although I LOVED Shiver, I didn't like this as much, although it's much better than many paranormals out there. Shiver was amazing, Linger a little less so. Still, a very good book.
B009329ZF2|5.0|At first seemed a little slow.  But once it got started action action actionnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The fight is a good fight when countries come together.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I just can't go into details but if you like a good mystery thriller, you should read Gone Girl! Haven't read anything else by Gillian Flynn but I will be after reading this one!!
B005DD7MH8|5.0|Fun, fun movie!  A little contrived, but I don't care about some plot holes. . .Cooper does a good job.
B00CEF014E|5.0|This book is intense! I thought it was a little slow at first but then the big idea kicked in and I had to click back to re-read the first few pages. What a devilish idea. I truly had no idea what was going to happen. There are at least two or three very cool twists. The narrative morphs seamlessly from psychological thriller to nail-biting horror and it all takes place in an experimental community - hippies living off the land and worshipping nature - which is a juicy setting for an intense mystery that leads to a bloody climax. The sequence in the forest was my favorite part. One of the best chases I have ever read probably. The title's significance really kicks in as the never ending sunlight becomes a part of the plot. Great stuff! It's a short book but I loved that there wasn't a single wasted word. Damian Stevenson is a talented new horror author. `Solstice' is Book 1 in the `Seasons' series but there are no other releases yet and I am very curious to see where the next one goes.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums that I've purchased this year.  Upbeat and creative melodies and lyrics that are great to sing along to or enjoy while working out!
0545123275|5.0|I love this book. It took me a few chapters to get into the changing perspective and temperature changes, but I'm SO glad I stuck with it. I just LOVE Maggie's writing style and her innovative premise. Highly recommend this book.
0062238868|1.0|I'm sure this book is great, but I don't know because I'm still waiting for it. I purchased it nearly a month ago and still nothing.
B001OMJGD0|4.0|I definitely like Man of Steel more, but I feel Superman Returns gets a bad rap for trying to bring back the classic charm of the Chrisopher Reeves' movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie though. Classic Superman: saving a falling plane, stopping bullets with his eyes, and saving an entire city from random disasters. Oh and did I mention lifting an island into space?
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I felt like it just 'ended&#34; no lead up to it or hope for more...love the rest of the book tho.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I don't understand why George had to divide the books in two parts.  I liked Dance With Dragons because it revisited the story lines from my favorite characters who were missing from the book before.
B00BTLOOAQ|5.0|WOW!  What a great album.  She's got it all.  Love her.  Great band.  I don't listen to a lot of jazz singers but she is wonderful.  Wish I could have seen her live.  Next time!!!
0385737955|3.0|Sorry, we tried to like this book.  Neither child liked it nor enjoyed the story.  Check it out from the library instead of buying.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|A lifetime favorite.  Captures the flavor of thinking like an imaginative, creative, and romantic boy.  I'm reading it to my son.  Excellent!
B000SXLL8O|5.0|Couple awesome songs. Definitely a must have if you are a Coldplay fan. Really good music for those pensive moods.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Excelent! Low price and high performance. I'm so satisfated. Number one of the category. Try now and be happy with it.
B005I4JG80|4.0|I probably would have been offended reading this book if I believed that the American way of raising children was perfect.  The author points out flaws in the typical way American kids are raised and how the French do it differently (or better, depending on your point of view).  There are some good ideas in this book and I intend to use them.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is really addicting and fun. I like to play it all the time. my cousins play it and so does my little sister.
B00D2HTRVQ|4.0|This game is colorul and easy to understand.. The children liked reparing this with the tools.It is entertaining and the animals are delightful.
B00B935SUY|5.0|If you're a fan of music you'll be a fan of this film.  Dave Grohl makes an excellent first effort film making.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The only bad thing about this show is that everyone nice dies.  I would recomend it to any one. h
B008OOYALE|1.0|i liked it at first but after that, i had to be on it constintly, and you had to buy apples to feed your dragons and you ran out quickly, very disapointed, tem lava, you could do better :( :(
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is very good. My friends told me to watch it and I was hooked since the pilot. Check it out.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey continues its amazing story telling in this season. There are new surprises waiting around every corner. You wont regret watching the 3rd installment.
B00D8RYV52|4.0|The children liked painting the vehicles, choosing the tires and that you could make them silly by putting ballons, propellers, blinking eyes and a couple of other things on them. They especially liked driving the vehicle after they repaired it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a great way to pass time and I just rated 4.50 because it took FOREVER TO DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!! ps the best app!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love the book. I was devoted to reading it. I finished it in 2 days. I also own the movie. Best book ever. I recommend it to readers that love long, old novels.
B000I62JBE|5.0|wow it was a great movie if you like good movies you will love this one  it keeps you on your toes
B000I9W08I|4.0|Always a good revisit to a classic - especially when it is easy online. Even better when the speed and quality is good.
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|My daughter loves it! She can't stop creating new designs with these. Thank you for variety of choices that came with the package.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|This app did not work at all. I was very disappointed in it.  Would like to know if others had a problem with it.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|You need to see this.  It is a classic.  But now with digital color best yet.  Best of the Robin Hoods.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|This is a good show. I missed the first season and currently watching this season. The writers are good and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. The main characters are very good acting and make the story line believable. I look forward to watching more.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|its not rambo but it's pretty cool the brittish army gets improssioned the coloneral get all wack over a bridge
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really. made. you think loved the various rooms needs more imaganation cannot wait for more the clues found not be clearer
B0013V2UU8|5.0|Bought this with Doors & Windows. My daughter loves them and immediately started building her creations. I love them too.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time! Wonderfully written and incredibly moving. You won't be able to put it down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so amazing and is kind of challenging our brains and testing us.the game is the bomb I love it so so so so so so so so so much.forrreeellzzys cow pig door cow button chocolate
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I like the fact that it would allow me to read PDF's just like a eBook reader. It connects to the network. Pretty neat for a free app.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Keeps you beyond interested and makes you feel as if you were there living the experiences with the lifelike characters!!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is one of the best selling gaming mice on Amazon and for good reason. I have a Logitech G400 for my desktop and i wanted another one for my laptop but $60 was too much for me. I then found this $40 mouse by Anker and seeing as how it was twenty dollars cheaper, i didn't think it would have the same quality as my Logitech but thankfully i was wrong. The mouse feels so comfortable in my hands and all the buttons are very well placed. The lighting is aesthetically cool but can also be used to show what profile you are using. That brings me to the one and only fault with the mouse, it only has 2 profiles. While this more than enough for any normal gamer, it would have been nice to get a few more and change them more easily instead of pressing the button on the bottom of the mouse. This issue does not affect standard usage and should only be a concern if your some macro maniac who needs specialized macros for every game you play.I also love how your cursor changes into the gauntlet and sword from Warcraft 3 while you use the included mouse software. It shows that who over made that program has some love of gaming and its a really nice gesture.  All in all though, it is one off the most comfortable and accurate mice i have ever used and definitely worth $40.
B00BNWWVFG|1.0|Jude Law carried the entire movie.  Everybody and everything else was a prop for his splendid performance. I've always liked Hitchcock type thrillers.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This story has fascinated me beyond comprehension. How plain the morale is. How poetic the writing was, that even today still fills its pages was sweet poetry.<br /><br />Lord Henry is the devil himself, who bare opinions without backing. Dorian wears his sins in his mind while others on their face. The truth is, no one can truly hide from one's actions.<br /><br />Beautifully written.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This new Theodore Boone book lives up to my expectations of John Grisham. I am enjoying the Boone series as much as I have enjoyed all of his previous books, and I am looking forward to the next one!
B00AG297GK|2.0|actually, Beavis and Butthead was a better show. I like comedies.. silly ones, however.. if I laugh twice thruout its entirety, it is too much.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|This movie was okay, but unfortunately not nearly as funny as the trailer would lead you to believe. Unfortunately, if you have seen the trailer you have seen 90% of the funniest parts of this movie. Still not a bad watch though.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|It was a pretty good movie I would give it 3 1/2 stars.  good actors, nice amount of action.  It was good for the price - worth the cost.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Sean Patrick has done a splendid job in connecting this short biography of Nicolai Tesla with the thought processes and behaviors that could enable others to accomplish similar feats.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Having read this book at least 4 times it never fails to take me in it;'s grip.  You literally are there in the Captains seat as Fearless rides headlong into destruction and you feel the rage as you follow the Captain to the remnant of Madrigal's crew.  If you haven't read on Basilisk Station then get it first!  You won't be sorry!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is soooooooo cool.<br />And you can find different items and win up to 100000000 coins.<br />Every month there's a new city and you can see the new featured people too.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Cause it is the first movie I streamed thru my kindle fire and I loved what the kidle did for this movie. Loved the movie, a classic.. and loved the device used to watch it.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Fun action flick with &#34;old&#34; people kicking *ss. Good movie for an afternoon in. Semi-predictable, but is a movie with Morgan Freeman ever bad?
B001HN6918|4.0|I liked the original more, but this one is still good.  Same actors, and great animation.  If you enjoy the actors, or cartoons you should like it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is such a challenging game. It leaves you wanting more. I would recommend it for everyone. I can't. Wait for more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun little thinking game! My children loved this game as well and I didn't mind letting them play because they at least had to use their brains.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|My daughter spend $85 of her own money, put this on her phone, went swimming & worked great.  Played basketball in the yard and the ball bounced and hit the phone.  CRACKED the screen.  Same day she bought it....  Cannot believe it!  So pissed.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Good movie but picture quality wasn't that good. HD version was not that clear.<br />Other than that it was good.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I normally don't do reviews, but I must for The Good Wife.  Overall the show is one of the best on TV. The best Drama or tied with Blue Bloods.  Love it.  Only criticism is sometimes there is too much quick action drama.  (Tying up the event / problem too quickly)  In today's world we have to have instant gratification, when in reality most events and problems are slow to develop or resolve.  The anticipation, the motives, emotions and tangent items develop in this show to make it entertaining; humorous, sad and occasionally deep. It keeps me coming back for more.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|The cast is great! Bound to be a classic. My 5yr old  loved it and we watched it as if it was the first time after so many years
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a great read! Love Gideon & Eva's story. Will read the series again 'til book 4 comes out!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Best solitaire game ever. Funny,challenging and entertaining beyond just playing cards. I love the commentary by the golf analysts and the gopher is a kick. If you want a way to while away hours,this is it.But I warned you,this game is hard to put down .
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I never thought I would like a period drama.  I was wrong.  Great acting, scripting and story telling.  If your not British there are couple things that may confuse you in the first episode of season one.  Keep watching, and you will understand.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|Like the title says, it's OK.  It listens to music and knows the song.  My only rub is it nags you on every song to go buy the song.  That would have knocked it down a few stars but the saving grace is you can put the found song in a queue and get it later.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This one is legendary.  Best ever.  Good quality graphic effect and upgrade suits are beyond my expectation.<br />Maybe This is standard.  But it is awesome. E again.
B007JNWQZS|5.0|Superb value for money set.<br /><br />My all time favourite movies and no one dishes up a bloody entertainment with class like Quentin Tarantino.<br />Excellent adult fare.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|Great story. would have watched it again if they would have given more time then 24hours to watch it in.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|There were sections in this book that had me helpless with laughter.  (Notably: when the main character Poppy mistakenly unwrapped her prospective mother-in-law's birthday gift; when Poppy colluded to cheat at Scrabble; and when she was arranging a replica of the missing engagement ring.)  I reckon if a book can make one laugh that much, then its author deserves applause.  It was a lighthearted easy read, but lots of fun.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|It's a great dance song, the beat is smooth and the lyrics... ahh yes!!!!!! We all can relate to Get Lucky!!!!!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Any time use Google search, I alwaysget the anwers I need.  I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you for great service.
8184776217|4.0|Probably a realistic practical ending for the trilogy but a let-down for me.  I only hope<br />when the movie is made, there will be a little more excitement to the Peeta/Katnis reunion. He is<br />digging with a shovel to plant primrose bushes (mutant primroses I guess since the primroses in our<br />world are about the size of African violets and don't require a lot of shoveling when planting)and she comes out of her house to see what is making the noise; they exchange a few words and that's about it initially.<br />  Also, now that the capitol is defeated and Haymitch is free to find someone he can love without fear<br />the capitol will use that love against him, why make him go back to being an alcoholic? Reformed alcoholics do exist and it would not have hurt to let Haymitch have a shot at happiness.<br />  This story did point out something very important: we all need to be patient and supportive when people we love go through either a mental or physical crisis of some sort which changes them...either physically or mentally. It is not the time to stop talking to them or run away. When I worked at the nursing home, we had patients whose family never visited them because \\"I can't stand to see daddy like this\\".  I am hoping those who hate the way Katnis treated Peeta after his \\"hijacking\\" will remember throughout their lives and always be there for the ones they love.
B004EWFUQY|4.0|I heard of this diet through a friend at work and I asked if I could read her book on my lunch break. I found it informative and easy to understand. His writing style is upbeat and fun and he talks to you as a peer. I decided to purchase the book after reading the first chapter and I devoured it in just a few days. This diet just makes sense and is simple enough to follow so I decided to give it a try. I lost 11 pounds in the first 10 days and I have gone on to reach my goal weight and keep it off while enjoying my life and not feeling as if I'm missing out on anything. This is not a fad, it's a real strategy for changing your life and resetting your weight to a healthy level that will not cause the yo yo effect that many diets can. I have recommended this book to several people and will continue to do so.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Enjoy playing this game. I like the way the skill levels keep climbing.<br />It requires a lot of focus and strategy.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This story is the inspiration for hundreds of pirate stories.  Great reading for adults and young alike. Easy reading for fun.
B008Y73940|5.0|Fast moving.  Very entertaining.  Good legal drama without getting boring<br />  Video streaming was excellent even though I have DEL.  HD picture quality great.  My first movie on my new kindle HD.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|If you enjoy magic, you will enjoy this app. The play is smooth and entertaining.  With the sealed pack portion makes the game have variety.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was recently introduced to Downton Abbey and have watched seasons 1, 2, and 3. I'm excited to watch season 4. Great show.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My friends were all excited to be going to see the movie premier and were shocked and scandalized that I had not yet read the books so I borrowed it from a friend and began reading it while they all went to see the movie. I have to say, I could not put it down. I felt an instant connection to Katniss and the other characters in the book and I found my self laughing out loud when Katniss showed up the judges, feeling Peeta's inadequacy, crying at the loss of Rue. It sucks you in at the start and doesn't ever let up. This book teaches you about prejudice, survival, love, sacrifice and being a hero to the one who loves you the best. It instantly became one of my top 10 in regards to book series and I have been reading it to my kids. If you haven't read it yet, if you are on the fence, take the chance. You won't regret it.
B001E9641K|5.0|I love the fact that Nordic countries is a stand alone game on it's own.  The smaller map is designed for a 2-3 player game.  It comes with full size cards.  As discussed in many of the reviews the \\"wild cards\\" are locomotives and can only be played on tunnels and bridges.  Players can pick up two locomotives on their turn.  Tunnels add an interesting dynamic to the game.  In order to complete a tunnell a player may be required to discard more cards from their hand.  Overall, the board tends to play accross the bottom and up the right hand side. Highly recommended.
B009LGO88E|5.0|This product shipped quickly. It works well with the North American region 3DS XL. I have not had any issues. I only wish there were more games that are compatible with the Circle Pad Pro. The Circle Pad Pro uses 1 AAA battery which is included in the package. The grip feels comfortable for extended game play. The Circle Pad Pro is light weight and a little bulky, but the 3DS XL is already bulky so that does not bother me. It is easy to use and to remove. Awesome product!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've always wanted a horse&hellip; this game is fun and keeps me wanting to achieve more and more, just wish it'd be easier to get more energy points. otherwise great game!
0425263924|5.0|Love this book and the whole series!!! Love Sylvia Day! I can't wait for more books from her and more from Gideon!
B007HUD6OS|5.0|John Grisham does it again!  Great story!  I can always count on Mr. Grisham for a great read!  Thank you John Grisham
B00992CF6W|3.0|this game has got me addicted! there is no other better game! now with the update it makes it ten Times better.ppl would really like it better if they used seeds which a lot of ppl don't use! I don't see any problem with this game.<br /><br />its high quality visual and audio.<br /><br />its add free!<br /><br />u can create as many worlds as u want!<br /><br />its fast and not slow glitchy<br /><br />it has wifi capable to connect with other players<br /><br />its for ppl who like creating<br /><br />its for ppl who like surviving<br /><br />its pretty much for anyone who likes to have fun!!!!!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Martin Freeman is an outstanding actor - he is such a joy to watch.  Peter Jackson is a director without peer and the New Zealand landscape is heavenly.  Don't miss.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It was fun, but level 9 freezes up. At first touch &amp;  was broken &amp; the remaining levels were not accessible.
B00BPCU28C|5.0|My niece adores this Dvd and was delighted to receive the tiara and guidebook!  She loves the music and sings &#34;i'm not ready to be a princess&#34; every day.
B00006RAKP|1.0|No CD Case and No Song List , I hate It!<br />Only White Paper CD Case and No Music title.
B00425S1H8|2.0|The prolific chip set is still a poor excuse for a serial port.  I would not recommend this device to anyone who needs RS232 ports for their computer.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I've enjoyed Ken Follett's books with the attention to detail.  This book kept me following closely and involved in the action.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved the Room. . I agree with other reviewer . . It didn't take long but that was because I used a hint a time or two . . Or three. Really shouldn't have. . With some clever thinking you will get it .absolutely loved graphics. I have not seen anything as gorgeous and fun as this. .you won't be disappointed. Can't wait for more.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I am always playing this game.<br />I am addicted.  What a game.<br />I love to hear it when the characters hit a wall or fall off a cliff.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I love this series... and the first season was wonderful.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to start from the beginning with Spartacus.
147674355X|5.0|All I have to say is WOW! This book blew me away emotionally! I refer it to everyone! There are sad parts but I urge everyone to read this book!  I've read it 2x and it gets you every time! I highly recommend you read this!!
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|The writing was decent but the story has suffered from bloat, and from predicatability. The ending is very humanist, which I expected but still disappointed by.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Having lived 15 years in England and Wales I feel a part of their history and this book involves the key countries involved in WWI and WWII.  A true page turner with the characters from the era painted with clarity and sympathy.  A good Follett!
B00005JM0B|4.0|This was a pretty good movie.  I still like the 2nd Terminator movie best.  But this was a good quality disc--no problems with it.  It came packaged well.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Eureka is just great...  Fun...  and worth watching<br />I would recommend it to anyone who is a SyFy fan.<br />Great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. It was fun and frustrating at times and really made you think. Can't wait for the next floors to come out.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|This game is so BORING!  Maybe we didn't play it long enough, but it was snoozeville from the start!  Doesn't keep my attention or my nine year old's attention very long.
030789701X|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Skyrim and was really looking forward to this updated guide. Kind of wish I had heard about it before I had bought the second revision lol (one released just before this one).
B003UESJH4|2.0|This movie was so dull. There was nothing great about the cinematography or anything. The camera work was weird, just like it was in Les Miserables. Tom Hooper seems to favor these off-center shots. I don't know why people keep raving about it -- are they perhaps kissing up to the royal family?<br /><br />Having just watched a recent documentary about the full extent of Edward VIII's Nazi sympathies, I think this movie would have been better if they had incorporated his pro-Nazi views. Then it would have been like the popular playboy Edward VIII's Nazi views against the shy anti-Nazi King George VI who has to overcome his shyness and stuttering to stand up to the Nazis.
B002ZE85YW|4.0|I enjoy all the terminator movies, and while this isn't my favorite, it was fun to watch.  The quality of the movie was good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So glad to be able to watch this so soon after it finished. Thanks to Amazon Prime.  And thanks for my new Kindle Fir HD I love it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you haven't started to read the book, this is the one you need to buy ASAP.  This book fulfills you in a way most would think not possible!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Happy the series has finally ended. But will miss all the characters I have known for several years. Brandon wrote a fantastic last three books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|SWEET game!!!! I own a horse an this game is awsome. Fun for all ages an can't put it down.
B009AP2G26|4.0|We failed to choose for HD thus quality was a user error issue and the sound cutting off maybe net speed (that Comcast famous fasle advertising  50mbs that is actually 3-15mbs)
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This product was shipped quickly and was packaged well to prevent damage.  I haven't watched the movie yet, but this is a comment about the product, not a movie review--so enough said.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Why bother reviewing the films themselves when you can find that kind of info over at IMDb? Let's look at the actual physical product:<br /><br />All three movies look pretty fantastic in high definition. I can see some of what people are complaining about with &#34;Raiders,&#34; but honestly, it's still leaps and bounds ahead of where we were with our VHS copy twenty years ago. I love the clarity and depth of picture that allows me to see even the pores on Marcus Brody's face. The audio mix brings Williams' score a new breath of life that adds richness to the overall experience.<br /><br />And what's more, the three films include a disc of bonus features and a mini frisbee that can double as a coaster or, with some imagination, a throwing star.<br /><br />My one complaint is the packaging. Whoever decided that sliding a disc in and out of its casing is a safe way to handle media is fooling themselves. I'm sure it will be a while before these discs get so scratched that they are unwatchable, but seriously, if I'm forking out more than $30 for a set of films, I better feel pretty secure about their future viewability.
B0063IH60K|3.0|limited  game...It will pass time if needed. but I am sure I won't use it much. I may not even keep it on my kindle
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I bought the book because I enjoy the TV show.  The book flowed like the show and it was enjoyable.
B00BY8DIT2|4.0|Liked Beth Hart when we saw her at the Lincoln Center Awards Show, and liked what we heard on Bonamassa's 'Live at the Beacon' CD.  She's got a good set of pipes and she's only going to get better.  Enjoyed the album.  She moves easily between the smooth stylings of forties jazz to a more hard rocking style on some other songs.
B005RDF2NA|5.0|It was just what I needed for my daughters. It helps when we are I'm the truck or even when they are restless with having to sit still.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|I love the show, and decided to get the season 1 shows.  They are something I will watch again and again
B0092EE5HY|4.0|Martin successfuly develops distinct voices and charactarization in these stories, with Haviland Tuf being the most distinctive, and quirky.  A good bit of humor runs through the serious problems raised in the stories. Both entertaining and thought-provoking.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Well when I go on it it doesent work on my devise but the good thing is that I played it once and it was awesome when u play this u can press a brake butten and a go butten and I would rate this for car people and fun people and car game people.I hope other people try it to !!!!! :)

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Such a great CD. First day I received this CD I played the whole thing and I was like it's over already?? Aw : ( I wanted more songs but the songs on this CD were great I played it again while I cleaned the entire house. Highly recommend she has such a vintage sounding voice it's beautiful to listen to it really is.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It's easy to set.  I like the repeat feature (I can set multiple days of the week to a particular time).  And it wakes me up - that's a good thing.
B001DU8T6I|4.0|For her very first album she did amazing especially with that voice of her. i know she did better than most disney stars. anyway it was a good album and i liked it, she made really good songs on it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is vary fun but I wish that we could train the horses.  I also don't like all of the adds that pop up while you are playing.
0345533054|5.0|At first I was afraid I wouldn't like this book because I would miss Myron, but I was wrong! This may be my favorite Harlan Coben book. Great plot. Lots of twists and turns, and surprise ending.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|First macbook pro retina 15&#34;<br />Got 90 mbps over my internet connection so i would assume its working.<br />Better than getting a usb to ethernet adapter as I didnt want to waste a usb 3.0 port for internet connectivity
1400052181|5.0|I am a little more than halfways finished with this book and it has been such a great summertime read. So much detail and it doesn't get boring because the author does such a great job of switching between the different people in the story. Highly recommend!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Once this movie started I could not look away.  The characters were real and easy to connect with. The sounds and sight of those waves raking through the town and what the people went through is unforgettable. The fact that it is a true story made it all the more terrifying and moving. Follow this movie up by checking out the real family on you tube. Wow.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|It's her first album to buy and I don't regret it any minute, I took a chance when Amazon recommended it and as a result I'm looking forward to collecting more of her music
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read every book and love True Blood on HBO.  I am sad this is the last book and wish the series would continue..
B000FC12SM|5.0|It's book makes total sense and it actually works. Very practical advice and helpful to understand the male's point of view. Excellent

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I am a big fan of Tina Fey's tv work, and loved  this book as well. I highly recommend it!
0425263924|4.0|My wife and I both read this book. I finished before she did, but I was surprised at the ending. I thought this would be the last book in this series, obviously I was mistaken. Can't wait for the next one!
B00BWDJILG|5.0|Great album as I expected from Joshua Redman, I'd listen and buy his albums anytime 'cause I just love Tenor Saxophone and I happened to be learning to play one and the likes of Joshua Redman, Mankunku Ngozi, Charles Loyd, John Coltrane are my inspiration
B0063IH60K|4.0|Only one version of this game. I would really like it if there were several more. It gets very boring very quickly.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I enjoy this game now more than ever, because the gems are a lot more frequent. Also, there are new environments.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|These cd's are amazing the are the best from Cher, and i can't wait to play them in my car,
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is pretty fun I like to make the horse go to one airow to the next and it is fun to practices
B00B29J0I6|4.0|can freeze at times and some scores aren't recorded. Seems to be well thought out in levels. Great thinking game.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great tool!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a great game to play on long boring car rides with family and friends please play it is fun
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love the fact it works on my Pc, laptop, droid phone, and kindle.  This versatility is very handy as a photographer.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|This is a great album of all of his hits and I really like all of the songs on this download.  And even better, you can get the CD and the download for only $3.99.  A steal.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This was a great movie to take you back to those days....<br />The storyline was a bit confusing... Ben has done better.<br />I was not too impressed in the end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was so much fun...I can't wait for more levels. I'm hopeful there will be more complicated puzzles and math involved!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think this game has potential to be the best tablet game for amazon other than minecraft it's really fun I like the power ups I I'm a big fan of the mystery box I think it's a great addition to the game
B008QI6EHQ|3.0|It is hard to rate this book because of its contents.  However, it is valuable as a source of information about Nazi mentallity because it is Hitler's own words.  I would give it five stars for a phychological study, but one star for what it says.  So, I put the rating in the middle.
B00A9ET4MC|3.0|Americanah<br /><br />I found learning the customs of Nigeria very interesting and I enjoyed the book but it was too long.  I got bored reading toward the end
B005DOJ68K|4.0|If you like CCR even just a little bit, then this is the album to buy.  Each song is a hit and a classic.  This is one of those albums full of songs that you'll never get tired of.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderfully done!  Can't wait for season 4! It's is a great series I. Can't wait for the series to continue!
147674355X|5.0|I loved this book and read it in one day.  I liked the twists and turns of this book along with the love story.  Colleen Hoover is turning into one of my favorite authors and I read A LOT of books.  Highly recommend!
0307352153|5.0|My boss recommended this and I'm glad he did.  This book is extremely well-researched.  Many points of view, many great take-aways for how one should change their behavior based on their underlining temperment.  Really calls-out the work-place environment and how &#34;loud&#34; talkative people are PERCEIVED as leaders.  In any case, you may need to fake it a little bit if you're not that person!
B003V1WXKU|5.0|This book is on my list of ten favorite books of all time, and I have read numerous books during my long life.  Mr. Feynman is highly educated, articulate, informative and funny!!  I have read this book several times, and enjoyed it each and every time.  I did not always understand some of the scrientific information, but he writes in such a way that I always got the gist of what he was saying.  An excellent read.
009950569X|5.0|I purchased this book and have not been asked or paid to give this review. I simply enjoyed the book that much that I had to stop and give my thoughts.<br />As a graphic designer my main goal is to make my designs stick with my target audience. This book should be required text for all college design courses. In fact, it should be the very first book students should read. Even if you are not a designer, but rather someone who is in business for themselves or trying to market a product, this is the book you need. Chip & Dan Heath give invaluable avenues to use for growing and marketing anything. They give true stories from successful business's and individuals. Many of these stories you may have heard of, but didn't know the whole story behind them. This will be a book that you will go back and refer to over and over again. In fact, I will be reading this again shortly. The stories and ideas make a person think differently on how they approach making ideas stick with people. Get this book new, used, digital... it doesn't matter, just get the book and you will be inspired.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1400064287 Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die]]<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Daniel L Carter
B0064MGU98|5.0|Have really been wanting to watch this show! So happy you have it on here. Can't wait to be all caught up
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Unexpected storylines and very tight editing. Acting is good in parts and the overall look of the show is very lively.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Love the music and the New challenges.  Would play any of the Quell games whenever the are available. Good job.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|We didn't know if we would like Boardwalk Empire yet now we cant wait for the next season to start
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think everyone should know about subway suffers. It's the best game in the world. Nothing is better than subway suffers. (This review was written by my daughter: Riley)
B00AF6B22E|3.0|The movie was interesting to watch, but I didn't like the role Denzel Washington was asked to play in it.  I would rather see him playing the hero, not the anti-hero in movies.  He was definitely the bad guy in this one.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Tom Cruise can no longer dominate the screen. And the actess that played the lawyer he was working with was awkward and never seemed comfortable. The Jack Reacher books are so good and very detailed partly because you are inside his head the whole way. The movie completely leaves that out and thus it's hard to get to know the main character let alone the plot of the story
B0086700CM|4.0|I like Temple Run, but for me, it's a little too fast.  With more practice, I hope to be able to get farther along in the game.
193700788X|5.0|Perhaps everyone in the world but myself knew that this is the last book in the Sookie Stackhouse series. While I am sorry to see the great characters fade away, I do agree they had traveled about as far as they needed to go. What surprised me most was not the very satisfactory ending, but the new (or newly revealed) attitude of the author. Given the proclivities to violence and acceptance of various types of demons, fairies, and various other monsters, the shift in Sookie's attitude to an almost Christian perspective was unexpected. Still, it is also allegorical of the raging rebellions that so many humans experience in their teens and 20's but who, inevitably, return to their root beliefs and core values when it comes time to settle down. The Queen of Oklahoma continues to insist on Eric honoring his father's marriage arrangements; the King of Nevada, etc., etc., must find some way of punishing Eric for killing Victor without actually admitting that he knows. And someone, or several someones, are trying to kill Sookie...and it doesn't seem to be a vampire. While not everyone likes Sookie, or understands her, how could so many hate her badly enough to try to kill her? and keep on trying?  Quite a story and interesting denouements!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|We've worn out and/or lost a few Kindle chargers.  This one works great and the charging times are reduced significantly!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 of Downton Abbey 1 continues to be just as intriguing as Season 1. The acting is excellent, the story line is fascinating. The costumes (wardrobes) are wonderful. It is truly a masterpiece!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|A small-blade wonder.  I am utterly untalented at sharpening any knife, axe, machete, scissors or other object that requires a consistent angle and stroke.  Somehow, even I have managed to put a decent edge on my pocket, hunting and survival knives, as well as my machete and hatchet.  Now, I admit I used a larger sharpener to start the big blades, just finishing them up with the little one, but even so, it finished them all with a good cutting edge.  I've used it dozens of times, and it still works great.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|For stars because it's a fun game. I had no issues with the graphics or the game play. Controls work for the style of game. The only reason I didn't five it five stars is because it didn't give me an incentive to keep playing other than to try and beat my old score. But because the scoring is random I had a hard time finding a good reason to keep playing.
B007N8RULO|4.0|lots of fun accept for the numerous ads that take several tries to exit from or to get around. Fun and challenging.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory makes nerdism and science sound fascinating. I love me some Howard Wolowitz/Simon Helberg. They are ALL hilarious.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was extremely disappointed with the ending of this book. It was one of the most ridiculous endings I have seen in a while. The sad part is that she had a good plot going on and it draws you in and keeps you interested. The ending just made the book a total bummer for me!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My husband had me download this after he got addicted to these escape style games. This has been a fun &quot;thinking&quot; game. Not overly difficult, but each level gets more complicated.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A very cool game,it makes you think, I like this kind of game basic but fun my son likes it too.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|So far except for one location, it knew all about all the remote locations in Brazil.  Loved the millions of photos of each place and the reviews...helps making a decision easier and the place less remote.  Good job!
1401937519|5.0|This is NOT a woowoo book about a near death experience. Rather, it is one woman's experience of near death, and how it brought her to a place of truly loving -- not just life but the people in it. Oh, and most important, about loving herself!
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I love Modern Family, I watch it on repeat quite often. Every cast member is hilarious. It really is like a modern 2013 family.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is the only game I have reviewed ever. But this Is the best game I have ever played definitely worth the money
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|it is very challenging. I am addicted to this game. fun for all ages my son has as much gun as I do. thank you tor this app
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|Altough I personally iked the movie. I don't think it could stand on it's own. If you  don't know the story going in, it really is difficulto follow.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed this game. Wish it had more levels! Searching for the clues and solving the puzzles was entertaining and not too difficult
B00D8RYV52|2.0|We have all of the Doc Panda games and we love them. The garage game was not the same quality. I expected so much more. There was no content. I agree with the customer that said that there could have been much more to do. Lost interest fast.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|The more I listen to this CD the more I like it, it is real similar to Just Push Play and I love that CD, but it also took me awhile to<br />like it!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I just started playing this game and I like it. My only complaint is that you run out of energy fast.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The length was perfect, it was funny, touching, and the soundtrack rocks. I can't wait to see Despicable Me 2!
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|A good recap but downplayed the important role Canadans played. Still there was some activity that did not jive with reports..
B00821OX98|5.0|It was great to view the beginning before watching the third episode. Great HD quality and sound. I would suggest this to everyone.
0316069906|5.0|I  KNOW BY THE TIME I FINISH THIS BOOK I WILL BE A VEGETARIAN IN USA...CANT READ BUT A FEW PAGES DAILY..
B004I744AS|4.0|Like the home page with the box games and extra info. WAs looking for a better dictionary app when came<br /><br />across this app so far been helpful.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I absolutely love Temple run.Wow what a fast paced adventure of a game.You really have to be good on your toes for this game. Quick turns,slides & jumps help you progress.You have this monster chasing you through out the game,so try to avoid him.Coins to collect along the way(almost like Sonic)to bump up your score.Fun for all ages.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Seriously, how many times can two people say you're beautiful. no, you're more beautiful, no you're beautiful.<br />I am so disappointed in this book and this author who has let greed now rule her life.  Not only did she not end the story here but now there's suppose to be two more books.  I would not recommend this story line any more,  Shame on you Syliva Day for starting to believe your own press
B009AMANBA|3.0|Being one who has read a great deal about Lincoln, I knew there would most probably be nothng new here but was interestd in the prsentaton. The characterizaion of Lincoln was excellent but only shown the sulln side of the man. Althogh I expcted this mght hve been the case, it did not meet my expctations
B008VBYN80|3.0|Game is very fun. The problem is GL can't keep the server going smooth causing game crashes. Also log in trouble and frequent dropping of friends and guild teammates. It gets a three due to all the technical issues GL has with it's server!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great show, excellent cast, kept me interested, and more importantly guessing, throughout the entire series.  Can't wait for Season 3!
B0002E5O9G|3.0|The songs are really good, but if you saw the movie first, you long for the voices of the cast.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I've been a Neil Gaiman fan many years but some of his stuff hasn't worked for me. Mainly American Gods. I loved the movies Stardust and MirrorMask. Coraline ... OK. I listen to most of my novels on Audible. Neverwhere was great ... story and narration (by Neil). Ocean was deeper (no pun), and also narrated by Neil on Audible. Poignant. Wonderful insight into a seven-year old's mind and wonderfully creative universe. Just dark enough and with just enough light and hope. I recommend it without reservation.
0375850864|4.0|got to me fast. it looked good the cover was on good shape . i was very happy with my book
B00003CXDV|5.0|This is a replalcement for a VHS. Star Trek was never like this. This is better. Have to watch itover to pick up the parts I missed because I was laughing so hard
B001IYCMNA|5.0|This device does EVERYTHING.  Its setup is straight forward (assuming you know a touch about networking).  It has great range, solid construction (despite its light weight), and a small footprint.  The antennas can be configured in just about any pattern.  The RJ45 port is shielded compatible, which I needed.  I recommend this device, and may be ordering another soon.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|As opposed to abruptly declaring the game over, this version of Mahjong automatically reshufles when there are no more moves, allowing the gamer to finish the puzzle.  Therefore, the challenge is to race the clock, not some random number generator that decides that you cannot finish the game.  The puzzles are varied, challenging, and range from easy to very difficult.  Highest recommendation.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice game, like it that they don't give hints. Interesting and addicting. All 3 of us liked playing! Can't wait for new rooms.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I Loved it!!  I can hardly wait for more rooms! This game really put my searching abilities in overdrive.  Awesome game!
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|As a dear friend warned me...there's 12 bucks i won't get back again... and I had such high hopes even so... When are producers going to get the idea that story is all! Actors, even great ones can't create silk out of a hair ball... And here's an idea- if you want to play with the new computer graphic program and dazzle yourself with your amazing special effects don't bother trying to tell a story, just post your visual constructions on line. Yep, I'd like to see some money spent on the actual story...you know human creation.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I recently downloaded the free version of this app for my 2 year old son. He absolutely LOVED it so I had to buy the full version! He's been under the weather the past two days and this game is all he's been wanting to play. He can do it all by himself and is learning all the letters. I would definitely recommend this app. LOVE IT!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Been using it on my kindle and it has worked just fine. Wouldn’t do without it. Try it you’ll like it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|By far the best bingo game I have ever played. Easy to get used to and it seems never ending which is good. Hard to get into any other bingo after playing this one. I LOVE THIS APP
B00846REIS|5.0|I don't normally read romance or sappy love books but I saw an interview with sylvia day on my news station one morning and decided to give her book a shot. I really enjoyed reading it and can't wait until I download books 2 and 3.
B000GJ0KOG|5.0|Wonderful movie and fast delivery!
B00CLILB66|5.0|Lovely... It was wonderful to see these British pros altogether, whose work I've enjoyed for years, swing a story that's not about &#34;the older generation&#34; dimming into that inevitable grey fog but as fully engaged humans with their love of life firmly in place. Dustin Hoffman's direction was feather-lite and right on the money. He let the cast do what they do- guiding, finessing the moment and holding the center. Masterful! ...sbd
B005GG0MIS|4.0|I found this book very interesting.  There are some things about the people in the White House that you will wish you did not know.  The lives of the Presidents are fasinating.  You will learn things about their personalities, actions and failures that you have never known.  It reenforces your thoughts on the ones that you liked and disliked.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in history and politics.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Good book. A page turner. It a walk back into a time well past us. If time travel were possible could history be changed without consequence? Try it, you’ll like it.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|This is one of Daniel Day Lewis's best performances. He is an extremely talented actor and this movie shows that.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|My husband and I loved this show. Very sad they didn't make more of them. We'll be watching the movie next.
B008220BLG|5.0|Such a simple idea, portrayed beautifully. I loved Aussie Actress Tereza Palmer and Nicholas Hoult as the leads - the fit was just right. The romance develops very naturally and easily. I loved the narration of the movie by R, allowing the audience to understand what he is feeling. Even though he doesn't have many lines, R communicates through his expressions. I loved the soundtrack. So much of the story is told through the music. Just the right mix of comedy and romance, and zombies! Loved it.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Love this entire season.  I really love the actors they were so good.  I even statred reading about the histoy of King Henry only to compare the movie to it.  This is really good!
B00BF11STU|5.0|Set your expectation for a drama based on actual events. The story follows a CIA agent's 12 year project to find one villain.<br />Well done. I have a new favorite in Bigelow.
B00C4QGGQU|5.0|Seen this movie when i was around 10 years old and to watch it now just brings back the old memories of the amazing film
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Robert Downing Jr, the best Sherlock by far, hope he makes more movies in this class, will buy them again.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Best game I have ever played I'm ALWAYS on if you are like me you will love this game soooo Have FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Another good Jack Reacher Book by Lee Child. I'm reading all the series, and am waiting for the 18th book in the series
B008X9Z37A|5.0|The Belkin Classic Case for the Kindle Fire HD7&#34; is sturdy and well-made. It makes me feel reassured that my Kindle HD7&#34; is so well protected!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The game is fun and all, but recently they have added ads. Everything was fine until that point. The ads make the game run a little slow when they are trying to load. But overall I enjoy and I keep playing.
B001H1UQRI|5.0|Awesome and real!!! If you walk talk and breathe and live in reality this is a must see!!! The movie is well put together. The words poetic...the hidden message..... very very clever!
B002PEP4C8|4.0|Engaging and disturbing. As someone who has worked with the criminal justice system, I can say that this is a very true-to-life depiction of the handling of sexual assault cases.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game is awesome and challenging. My only concern is the shop. It dosent give you the gems when yu buy them. I tried it out as a test...bad move lol
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Another good Jack Reacher Book by Lee Child. I'm reading all the series, and am waiting for the 18th book in the series
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I LOVE the songs! And, I love the model she sets for young women everywhere! She is a TRUE artist! I would absolutely highly recommend this album!!!
B00CATSONE|3.0|I liked parts of this book because of the information gleaned.  I suspect it is a bit biased.<br />Worth reading.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is my&quot;go to&quot; so every day....gives me all the info for my city and for any I'm about to visit!
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Larsson is well up there with other Scandinavian writers.  I think that he puts more flesh into his characters than a lot of writers from other countries.  The movie was not bad.  There was a lot left out and things put in that were different from the book.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Another good Jack Reacher Book by Lee Child. I'm reading all the series, and am waiting for the 18th book in the series
B0063IH60K|5.0|I often play Solitaire on the computer, but it is SO much more fun with Solitaire from Mobility Ware on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. I can take it with me wherever I go and play, play, play! I highly recommend it!!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I can check up and comment on my children and my grandchildren.  Keeps me in the loop with them and some relatives and friends.  I do not have a profile, and do not want one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game will be awesome to play this game.What will happen this game will be in part 2?That will be more fun!
0812992784|5.0|Salman Rushdie is a hero for free speech. Loved the detail in the book. The slimey pols who cared more about their re-election than supporting free speech over a murderous mullah.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Another good Jack Reacher Book by Lee Child. I'm reading all the series, and am waiting for the 18th book in the series
B0097HSS4M|3.0|There are not many good editing apps for the kindle, but this is one of the best ones I found. Its alright for what I need, but I know there are better editing apps for the iPads and iPhones.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|My kids are very happy with the new blue-ray discs and I think they are going to make me watch them all for a while.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I MUST SAY THIS THIRD INSTALLMENT IS MY FAVORITE OF THE THREE BOOKS.  I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN BOOK FOUR.  YES THERE IS A BOOK FOUR COMING.  IT IS SO MUCH HAPPIER AND LESS DARK, IF THERE IS A SUCH THING WITH EVA AND GIDEON.  I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEIR LOVE ON THIS ONE.  THEY HAVE GROWN SO MUCH AND BOTH CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.  THIS IS THE BOOK THAT HAS MADE ME AN EVA/GIDEON FAN.  BEFORE THIS BOOK I WAS ON THE FENCE ABOUT THIS COUPLE.  SYLVIA REALLY LEFT ME WANTING MORE WITH THIS ONE.
B005EHILV4|4.0|I've been using this interface to record vocals and acoustic guitar with a mic, and for my first times recording, I'm very happy with the results.  I've never experienced any trouble connecting this to my computer and the sound quality's always something I'm content with.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|It didn't hold my interest, the writing style and descriptions didn't retain my interest on a continuing basis.  So there!!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love twitter and this app is the perfect setup for it. I don't have any complaints. I think twitter should be more popular than it is.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is a great way to learn about differences in socioeconomic status.<br />I think every one should have the opportunity to watch it!
B00AA0U05A|5.0|A terrific recording. I have over 1500 cd's in my collection, but this is my new favorite. Emmy has created a collection of songs that never get old. If you enjoyed the Linda Ronstadt / Nelson Riddle recordings of two decades ago you need to buy this cd. Emmy covers this material with ease and brings a new freshness to this classic collection of standards. I cannot wait for her next effort.
B001B68XRY|4.0|Nothing to add to what I have already said about the Longest yard. Don't remember oredering both movies, but my senility kicks in occasionally.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I saw this app and i tried to download it. Big mistake. It froze everything web related on my kindle,  stopped downloading at  54% ,its a pretty big game, and i can't uninstall it until it installs it completely. A huge waste of my time just to fix something i was originally going to skip out on in the first place.
B006YC74E8|3.0|There are not many good editing apps for the kindle, but this is one of the best ones I found. Its alright for what I need, but I know there are better editing apps for the iPads and iPhones.
B0064MGU98|4.0|&#34;The Good Wife&#34; is well written. Fortunately, the writers were able to balance work and private lives of the characters in such a skilled way as to avoid a soap opera script. This series focuses on the law, lawyers, politics, and a strong professional woman.
B00CHILW64|4.0|People forget the devastation caused by the earthquake and ensuing tsunami. The acting is quite good and filming is first class.
1476735115|5.0|In one word Fantastic.Great story by Hugh Howey and I have bought the omnibus to compliment my library of great stories.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is awesome.  Best word to describe it.....AWESOME!!!<br />Don't think about getting it just get it pure awesome. And find forget to get nervous virus ad on and drop the zombies in th mix.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love Temple Run 2 a lot. It's such a fun game, and is much better than the original Temple Run. It's one of the only games I play, because it's so entreating and never gets boring.
B000I9W08I|5.0|I have always loved Hello Dolly and seeing it again was a joy.  I am going to purchase the Blu-ray dvd.  This is the kind of movie,musical that makes you want to sing and dance right along with it.  The actors are fantastic.  Streisand as Dolly Levi, Walter Mathau as horris  and a young Michael Crawford as Barnaby.  It all comes together as a don't want to miss feature.  It is definitely &#34;makes you happy&#34; movie whose songs you will have in your head for days to come
B002OR0RP0|3.0|toddler liked it, but kind of scared him.  may not be best for a 3yo.  but, my toddler loves mammoths/mastodons and dinos.
1451629192|5.0|Dugard has so much courage and strength. This book was very difficult to read because of the content, but she expressed herself well and really touched my heart. I couldn't put this book down.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I had never had the opportunity to read this American classic before and always wanted to do so. I definitely noticed a lot of differences between it and the story was portrayed in the timeless movie but it was still a wonderful reading adventure
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love kik so much, it is such an easy way to talk to my friends. Its fun and you can send pictures too. Although I don't know how to send videos or watch sent ones, but thats ok.
B000YMQI6E|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the plotline and the acting! Ryan Gossling & Anthony Hopkins are fantastic. I would definitely recommend this movi
B000YABS8E|5.0|Every time we watch this little gem, we love it all over again.  It is a fun romp that leaves us smiling and quoting Brendan.  Simply entertaining.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Funny, sentimental, new yet familiar.  The minions are the best part of the story.  Very young children may not understand the story, but they will laugh at the actions.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|THIS app really works got 64 diamonds for free!!!!!!!!!!!! I use it all the time wish I had $1 to get the pro version where you can spawn mobs
B00CL68BK2|4.0|I really really loved the book. I thought the ideas were brilliant and it was written to perfection. But the movie was not quite as good. I did enjoy it very much but I think they should have incorporated the ideas more instead of changing it so much. I also don't think the casting was as good as it could have been. Of course I loved Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, they are two of my favorite actors, but I think some of the other characters should have been played but different actors. Overall, it was a great movie, but nothing compared to the book.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book was sooooooooo amazing! I am now seeing the world differently, better. This is definitely the best book of the whole series!!!!!!! :)
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Not as gory as the the first two, thankfully. Managed to rope us in and watch the whole season in three nights. Just when you think you have figured out where it's going, you discover you're wrong---which is what keeps us watching.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|A great, funny love story, without the typical ending.  Breaking up happens, and we survive!  It's good for teens to see that it doesn't have to be the end of the world when a relationship doesn't go on.
0345529057|5.0|This is a very well thought out and well written series. The only problem is the new books not being published fast enough.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app it is so awesome. Im just so mad it wont let me connect with face book why<br />It makes me mad
B0037RDPEG|2.0|I am disappointed in Eat Pray Love as I had heard many references to it. After reading Almost French I had expected that they would compare. I saw no purpose in the story other than a self indulgent travelogue. I am finding it tedious to read.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Brilliant show. Harvey's character is Handsome, witty, clever and well dressed. Love that Mike picks up those qualities along the season. Can't wait to start next season!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This is a movie that I will watch again. The reality and authenticity of this movie struck a deep cord within my soul. A true Terantino movie that I am recommending to my family and friends!
1451695195|5.0|I cannot write anything new that others have not already said. This account will inspire you and uplift you. I know it did me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! hard to stop playing. Gets harder as it goes I had no problems I wish there were more levels
B001GA1RFA|4.0|This is a great read. As always I find books by John green very interesting. He keeps it light and humorous with very deplorable characters. They all have their independent struggles and it is interesting to watch them develop and solve their problems. Colin and his friends learn so much about themselves and they made some rather deep discoveries. I recommend this book to John Green fans and anyone else looking for an altogether good book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I find this game very addictive. My kids love it also. If you're debating whether you should get this app or not, get it! You won't regret it. I definitely recommend this app.
B005544V6A|5.0|An excellent series that depicts the ups and downs of a high profile lawyer office and the differing ways to handle the cases as well as working with co-workers.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was very excited for this book, but it is just a tease as it just sets you up for the next book. If you liked the other books (and I did) I would suggest you read it because the information will be essential for the next book. I hope she writes fast because I really want to see where this is headed.
B0064W652A|5.0|This is the second Batman storyline i've read and i've got to write that i like it more then year one. This storyline introduced a new villain and created a mystery that develops and grows over time. What i like the most in this storyline is how Batman is written so you hear his thoughts and opinions. I think that this is a must-read for both new and experienced Batman-readers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have never played an app that i like more than subway surfers. It is a better version of temple run.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I liked the app better before the last update. After a while of using this app you get used to it and it is nice....but the other was much better.
0316017930|5.0|This was a very interesting read.  I enjoyed it and couldn't put it down.  It gives some cool insight to why and how some things seem to happen.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|One of the best Steven King Adaptaptations.  Only one better is perhaps the Green Mile.  If you have never seen it I highly recommend it,
B00BC24NT4|4.0|A Delicate truth caught me the same way that other Carre books  did  Ithought it would never get started --as all the people were introduced and started down their various pathways --until the multiple  groups began to interact --then<br />it got good==good enough to hurry to the end.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Addicting.....lots of fun and love challenging myself. Wish it didn't limit the lives you receive.need more games like this! Have fun with this one.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A sweet little Irish story full of life's complexities and a good twist of fate. Enjoyable, easy read with a heart-warming main character. I just wanted to give him a hug.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I can't figure it out.  They need to give some hints.  I keep getting stuck and then have to start all over.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|YES SIR, BOSS!<br />One of Paul Newman's best roles. Great cast and it depicted the old South the way it was back then.
B0085HWZDK|5.0|Robert Plant could continue to play Led Zeppelin tunes 'just like the record' for decades and fill venues with ecstatic fans. Or he could simply reunite with his old cohorts and make millions, some suggest billions, doing Led Zeppelin stadium gigs all over the plant.  Instead, he's chosen to honor his own authenticity and musical curiosity, following his muse where it takes him and giving those smart enough to follow along a musical education in the process.  I consider myself one of the enlightened: Because of him, I broke down and paid attention to bluegrass and American roots music and while I will never be a fan of modern Country music, there are now a number of well-loved bluegrass albums in my collection and I have him to thank for their discovery.  This DVD (and the CD and band that gave birth to it) and his work with Allison Krauss are two primary reasons why.<br /><br />This performance is a tour-d-force of musicianship.  Every member of the band brings something exquisite to the table, and the sum is a celebration of it's parts.  This is a group of players at their best who understand the language of music and use it masterfully to communicate with their audience.  Nearly anyone who loves music will find something here to enjoy, and that diversity is probably the very best part.<br /><br />Plunk your coins down and take this one home.  You won't be disappointed.
B005DJREGQ|2.0|I thought this program was going to help my daughter. I was watching the very first episode in which the protagonist slept with a guy she met. It was too much. Not necessary. Maybe that's why was entitled awkward.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|have really enjoyed all the game of thrones books,and am eagerly awaiting the newest one..i hope it will be available soon as i am getting withdrawal symptoms without it.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Favorite feature is the app coming to the foreground when you plug or unplug the power. Gives accurate time left and accurate time til fully charged.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|Kind of like the Man In the Iron Mask fights Hitler.<br /><br />It's like a remake of Hitler's human test atrocities in the future.<br /><br />This is what has happened when conservatism is taken to the extreme... you get Hitler....<br /><br />In today's modern world, there are extreme conservative political parties.... watch out... don't be blinded by what they say... back out and use your head.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|I AM HOOKED ON THE SERIES. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE BEFORE MIDNIGHT. I AM NOT SURE WHY I AM SO INTRIGUED BY THIS SERIES BUT I AM.  IT JUST A DAY IN TWO PEOPLES LIVES AND IT IS INTERESTING.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|this is a very clever and entertaining app..... I like it better the angry birds... keeps changing and get more and more challenging
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had trouble on level 4 it wouldn't let me get the keys is there some other way to get them if there is Will you help me out please
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I loved the music and dancing. I especially enjoyed the character development. It had plot changes that I did not expect.It was awesome!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent acting  -authentic settings and believable story lines. Only the BBC does this type of period piece drama this well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think its awesome because you hace no limits I have has it for two years and I have love!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series.  This series begins at the onset of WW1, so there's a lot of history involved as the world<br />changes around our characters at Downton from servant to aristocrasy.  I found myself really caring about<br />these characters.  Great costumes!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have had subway surfers world tour since it was on Rome that is the reason I got this app is because I want to go to to Rome really bad! I love this game you should get it if you dont have it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Omg.... What kind of ending is that?? It was terrible and it ruined a great book! It bought it from being great to just being good!! I would still encourage people to read it but be warned that the ending is $#IT and leaves you hanging!!
B009K0OL06|4.0|Good series even if the story lines became  a bit too complex and unlikely towards the end.The finale was a bit far fetched.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it because it is a exploring game and has two game plays creative and survival<br />You get two build stuff.
1442359919|5.0|I was very much surprised at how well this book was written. It was a different type of story than the usual Stephen King but it was a great story. I believe it would make a pretty good mini series on TV also. He couldn't help himself and did put just a hint of supernatural in the story, but not much. I thought it was a great story, and I am looking forward to Doctor Sleep in September.
B002MS5TPY|5.0|Released early in the summer of '89, The Stone Roses' first album still sounds fresh and exciting nearly a quarter-century later. The songs are strangely gorgeous, almost femininely so, when compared to later Mancunian bands (Oasis is an obvious example).    Kicking off with the poignant indie anthem \\"I Wanna Be Adored\\", this near-perfect album then breezes through eleven songs, all of them brilliant: highlights \\"She Bangs the Drums\\", a declaration of love and newness as tangy as the lemons on the album cover; the life-affirming \\"Waterfall\\"; the revolution hymn \\"Made of Stone\\"; \\"This Is the One\\", a tastefully bombastic song about love and starting over; and, last but not least, the screw-you anthem \\"I Am the Resurrection\\", which is somehow simultaneously lighthearted and vicious. The songs, skillfully written, are brought to vivid, colorful life through vocalist Ian Brown's soft, distinctive voice, John Squire's psychedelic guitar stylings, and the quirky, hard-driving rhythm section, consisting of bassist Gary \\"Mani\\" Mounfield and drummer Alan \\"Reni\\" Wren.    This album is, in my opinion, rather underrated. Over here in America, you'll get blank stares if you ask most people if they've heard of The Stone Roses. They're missing out. This should be a mandatory item in any music-lover's library. I wholeheartedly recommend that you buy this album and worship it, if you haven't already.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|He is a wonderful storyteller! Loved how he wove the different characters thru the story and made the connections. Recommend!
B00D41H2PS|1.0|I could not get it to do the ship . I decided to see if anyone else had trouble and read several other people had the same trouble so decided to delete it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great and easy read. Read all 3 books in a week very addicting once I started couldn't put down. Definitely would recommend
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool was a recommendation based on my interest in Dan Simmons.  I went into it with no expectations, and was very, very much rewarded!  I wouldn't really say that their styles are similar, however, like a good Dan Simmons novel, I had a super tough time putting Howey's Wool down.  This was the first book in YEARS I've enjoyed so thoroughly!<br /><br />Hooray Books!:)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its so freakin awesome if u lyke playin temple run this is way better in my eyes so and its free so what u got to lose? So tap get app and download and install this app
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait for season 4!  All I know is stay away from Downton if you are going to have a baby.
1582701709|5.0|This book shares real life journeys of successful people, who understand the principles and laws that govern the Universe. These principles are powerful and whats best- is you can put them to the test for yourself! So for all the negative ratings- I say push IGNORE, unless you are  one to believe only what you can see- then, this book is not for you. If you are spiritual and you know there is power to be tapped into- MUST READ.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Brilliant, I wish there was more book at the end! I didn't want to finish it, I look forward to reading more books of his.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|If you loved The Lion you'll love this one too!  Great plot twists and turns all the way through.  An exciting read!
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. Good realistic plot...somewhat predictable but still good acting by Washington. Denzel is that versatile in the roles he can play. He did a great job playing a pilot who is also an alcoholic and a coke head, with an ex-wife and a son. Watching him deny and fight his addictions while being investigated for the plane accident was good suspense that kept me glued. The ending could have gone anywhere... Forget the critics, there will always be one.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|This is the tablet version and far better than the standard phone version, I have both. I bought this one and figured out it could be side loaded onto the Note 2 just fine. You need to be rooted so you can adjust your Screen density to around 160 - 200 but after than Bam it's beautiful and allows for a level of detail far better than what the phone version allows.
B00B4804KS|5.0|If there was ever a movie made for 3D it was Jurassic park. Even though it was not filmed in 3D they did an amazing job putting it to 3D. Hopefully when Jurassic park 4 comes out sometime next year it will be in 3D also. I think even the toughest of critics who will review this movie will agree that it was done well. I watched the movie on a 55'' Samsung LED 3D T.V, using a PS3 as my 3D player and the 3D glasses that came with my tv. Enjoy!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The best performances I have seen  of this iconic musical. Amazing, talented cast from several companies come together for an amazing concert performance of Les Miz' amazing music. Performances from the original cast make this a must-have if you are devoted fan of this musical.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game for my children to do and I think they really enjoy it. Thanks for inventing it. Who ever did.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|nice originality on teens in HS. More kids come into this world therefore we still should have teen movies. I like that this one has a peculiar perspective of storytelling.
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|The music is really good. The band has actually improved and along with it they haven't changed their style of music.
B00AFPVPDG|4.0|Well, I am a fan of Josh. I bought his book on Personal MBA and I also got this expecting to be blown away. While I was actually impressed that I could learn anything in 20 hours, some of the sections of the book were not so much of help. Below are my points:<br /><br />1. I am the type that loves the unique knowledge a book brings when you read them. It would be nice to be a jack of many trades....not like I would like to be master of all. This book tells you exactly how to do that. If there is any part of the book I found so useful, it is the fact that any complex thing to learn can be deconstructed into simple task that when perfected, will allow us acquire the skill...<br /><br />2. some chapters of the book are of less relevance. To me, the part on web programming was a complete waste of time. But again, Josh is only telling us how he did it and not a book to learn programming.<br /><br />Generally, not an out of this world book but good enough for me to tell me how to start learning stuff. I have picked up a typing tutor software and will perfect my QWERTY type. I hope to be able to type up to 80wpm. I am also going to learn the guitar and read a new book every 2 weeks. This is why I am rating the book 4 stars!
B008Q08T54|3.0|It was OK.  There were a lot of story lines - not sure if they were all needed.  Simplicity would have made this a tad more entertaining.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book/omnibus was truly excellent. The author crafts a tight, terrifying apocalyptic world, filled it with characters you can care about and tells an exciting story that tantalizingly reveals just enough about the setting to keep you reading. Excited to read the next books in the series!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I usually do not ever read the book &#34;after&#34; I see the movie, but in this case I am so glad I did.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Like many other time wasting games, you create your own little town and collect the money generated to expand your community. while this is a generally good system, Oregon trail fails in the fact that you are limited in what you can do. almost every action requires energy, of which you only have a limited amount limiting what you can accomplish. the game also tends to freeze, forcing me to restart my kindle fire constantly.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Beautiful young adult novel, the main characters are deep and interesting, and super intelligent. It treats the subject of sickness and death with such nuance.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|If you want to see the inside real world of elite Navy Seals this is the book to read for sure.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Its an okay game but  if you run out of energy or money its over. Game doesn't last very long.
B000Q9IR0A|5.0|This is the best book I've found on plain old execution. It's written from the perspective of a very large company, but is just as applicable to my startup.
141694737X|5.0|Classic book. I loved as a child and was excited to get as a gift for a child. This book is now one of her favorites. She is between the 1 and 2 years. We read it repeatedly.
B003V9OCIS|4.0|The dangers and obstacles of the attempts to scale the Eiger North Face in the Alps. We were engaged the whole time. The secondary story lines of the spectators, the looming Nazi invasions and the love story add contrast.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|This has some humor in it, but it is actually more on the side of a teen romance.  Thought it was okay, but definately not a must see.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It was exactly what I needed. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. All of my Amazon purchases have met or exceeded my expectations.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This a fun game for me. I usually play word games so its nice to play something different.  I rated it 3 stars because it takes too long to get pearls and some of the things you need require pearls. Also friends are difficulr too.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|A look at the industrialization of our food supply and how the needs of large buyers have driven this economy. Ultimately we (the customers) who patronize the large buyers (eg McDonald's) have set up this supply and demand.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|A few funny parts and a neat concept, but that was about it.  Women and female children more likely to enjoy it.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Great game.Just like all the angry birds games.I really like this one because it's more challenging.can'<br />T wait f<br />or the next one
034580404X|3.0|I choose this rating because the last book was covered in dirt.  The book 3 the last page was coverd in some kind of dirt, I don't know why. But it looks ugly
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is great fun trying to figure out how to get out of the room! Just when you think you have it figured out the next floor brings a new challenge. Super Fun and great way to keep your mind working.
1442337966|5.0|In a world of chaos its nice to listen to &#34;The Power&#34;<br />Some parts sound a little far fetched but the over all concept of loving eachother and ourselves<br />works for me!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was addicting from the very first page I read. I was so anxious to get to the end, I blew through the book in a few days. Definitely going to continue reading the series. I'm a fan to say the least.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I am an avid book reader and have reached the time in my life where I can read a book or two each week. And although I usually read historical fiction, I was somehow drawn into this after reading a sample section of the book. Kate had a way of leading the reader into three specific spans of time and developing her characters and storyline. It was most difficult to put down as each turn of the page presented clues to a mystery...a mystery about a little girl placed on a ship bound for Australia from a London port, alone and hidden with only a little white suitcase. There are no predictable events, including the end. It was a very satisfying read and am looking forward to reading other titles from this author. Enjoy.
B001WCN232|5.0|This one seemed to get short shrift from critics, yet when heard today, it stands well against other music from 1973 and certainly sounds like vintage Stones to me. Certain tracks, less heard, actually are pretty great, such as \\"Winter.\\" This almost seemed like a swan song back in 1973 after the Stones had done so many great albums. Yet, as history has shown, they were just getting started. And this one ranks right alongside comparable \\"B\\" albums like \\"Between the Buttons,\\" \\"Black and Blue\\" and \\"Undercover.\\" Which is to say, it most definitely has some great material on it, the \\"hits\\" being among the least of it, at least to me. I never fell for \\"Angie,\\" though it brings back some memories, for sure. Give this one a listen. It's really pretty good.
038572179X|5.0|This is my first attempt at a book review, and I could not have chosen a better book with which to begin.<br /><br />This book is divided into four parts - each beautifully and brilliantly different than the other three. The first 240 pages reminded me of To Kill A Mockingbird. This section focuses on 13-year-old aspiring writer Briony Tallis, whose misinterpretation of adult motivations and actions leads her to wrongfully accuse a servant's son - Robbie - of a crime that's consequences would follow him through the horrors of World War II. The book is a bit slow to get started, but something about McEwan's storytelling captivated me from the beginning. There were certainly times I questioned why I kept reading, but I never considered putting the book down.<br /><br />The second part of the book follows Robbie through the carnage of WWII. McEwan's vivid descriptions of the scenes Robbie witnesses as a soldier are absolutely incredible. Like the first part of the novel, it gets a bit slow at times, but at least by now I understood why I was so interested in the story.<br /><br />In the third section, the reader is reunited with an 18-year-old Briony who is now working as a nurse at a hospital for wounded soldiers. The repercussions of her false testimony are becoming more evident as we see where the other key characters are five years after the crime.<br /><br />The final section skips ahead to 1999, but that's all I will say about that for fear of ruining the beautiful ending.<br /><br />This is definitely a book that is defined by its ending. As a reader, my favorite moment is when the pieces start to fall into place and the author's vision for the work finally becomes clear and it's brilliant. McEwan certainly did not disappoint. As the final pieces fell into place, I felt in awe of the masterpiece he created.<br /><br />His descriptions of specific moments - their smells, lighting, and sounds - are fantastic, but his style was even more impressive. The writing style ages with the characters. In the first section, Briony is an amateur writer; the shorter chapters and limited understanding of each character's motivations reflect that. By the second and third section, the work becomes much more focused and develops a much more fluid style as its creator matures as a writer. McEwan's prose and the brilliance of the conclusion of this novel easily make it one of my new favorite books.<br /><br />[...]
B002W7H3EA|5.0|This movie has everything suspence, romance, action and great music and suprises via Hitchcock. The cornfield scene was great. The villian's house is similar to James Bond's Diamonds are Forever penthouse.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was such  a touching book. I love the ending. It really makes you feel bad for kids like August
B00CEF014E|5.0|The first half is like a psychological thriller but there's a chilling twist halfway through the story that takes the narrative beyond suspense into more disturbing territory. It starts off being about an emotionally compromised young lady who may or not be suffering from paranoid delusions when she tells the police that her boyfriend is missing. No one believes that he is real and after much nerve-biting shenanigans the murder mystery is dismissed by the police as a figment of her imagination. But then slowly piece by piece the `truth' as we believe it is dismantled and the story shifts into a story of survival as our heroine, who is shown to be not crazy, has to run for her life.<br />It's a bit like two stories in one. I would like to have known more about the two sisters, what their lives were like before Zoe joined the Rainbow Collective, and also I didn't really understand the Clive character fully. But overall this was a thrilling page turner that left me breathless and gave me that intense heart-in-mouth feeling as I read.<br />A very well written suspense-horror novella.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|The movie was very well presented. A movie which can be enjoyed for all aged family members. The best part to the movie is that little children who understands nursery story can follow it!
0061950726|4.0|I didn't know what to expect but was very impressed with the treatment of this way of getting homeless children off the streets of New York City.  The book read well and I have already read it a couple times and am going to pass it around to my reader friends.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Heart wrenching ending leaves you hanging wanting the next series! My sister didn't like it and warned me. I'm looking forward to # 4.
0385737955|4.0|4.5<br />It all started with a memory loss, a klunk situation, and a touch of memory.<br />Thomas wakes up in a box, he has few memories and lots of questions. Doors open and he's thrust into a world of young boys, strange words and terror. There is something, in his memories tugging but not revealing. He feeling like he's been here or knows this place but no, oh he doesn't know. He just knows he is to be a runner.<br />This world he is now is is a wonder of questions, where do mysterious supplies come from. What are the Grievers ? What is this wall that moves ? Where is the exit to this maze of death ? Yes, it is some weird maze with deadly creatures roaming, hunting the boys. Many have failed, there is a graveyard that shows that. Even with all this there is a sense of normality, cooking, eating, farming, cleaning, medical aid. But where did they all come from and why ?<br />Days after Thomas arrives things hit a tornado, A girl comes in the box she says everything is going to change. Oh boy it that an understatement. Things change, death comes for some, insanity for others. The maze is not done with them yet.<br />Action, mystery, adventure and wonderful lovable and wicked characters. I read this at the recommendation of my daughter, she loved it, and I can see why. I felt like a feel into the matrix with all the steps and layers that build on top of each other to make a simple story complex. Thrilled and excited, is how it left me. I am off to find book 2 in this trilogy<br />OMg Cliffhanger ! Grumble, Grumble, Grumble...
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Was a good Movie. Not so predcictable. Most men would like it...women also. Not your usual movie. Most will like.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game!  I play it on my kindle daily....and the price certainly cannot be beat...free is good!<br />Wonderful game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game because of all the grafics<br />but the monkey is scary. For all you people who like surprises at every turn<br />this is the game for you.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a while! The story grips from the start as you can't help but like Clay and commiserate with his place in the world - feeling like everyone is more successful. Then of course you just end up adoring Penumbra and want him to realize his dream during his life. The oddness of the situation and the endearing personalities of all the characters just makes you want to keep reading, not to mention hope of learning the code! I am not quite ready to say he is as talented as Jasper Fforde or Terry Pratchet, but I am going to read more of Sloan's work for sure!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game... the only thing I don't like is that there's only 10 levels! I will right this a 5 if they get more level!
B00B7PIRIE|2.0|We started the first season DVD and all was fine, however the 2nd season 1st disk had a few &#34;dead&#34; spots and this continued so bad that we couldn't even watch it. Went on to the 3rd season, and still had some problems, but was able to watch most of it.<br />What a DISAPPOINT!!!!<br />Sorry can't recommend this Company OR their Products
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. You will be surprised at how fun it is<br />I got it for x-mas loved it so much.
B001NLKS16|5.0|If you are a fan of supernatural you will love it.  It is a book that opens up alot. I loved it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game for kids and adults. Great pictures! I just love this game so much. Keep sending me the the updates.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have never taken the time to do a review before but this was worth doing so! Amazing game reminiscent of Myst. Short but worth the money. I eagerly await more.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Enjoyed this book_ a little upset with the twist but it is a good book!  Can't wait to read on
B00AB55BS0|4.0|Of course the books are much better.  This season stays very close to the book and I liked that about it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good way to spend a rainy afternoon.  Puzzles are difficult July enough to hold your attention but not so hard as to frustrate.  The puzzles that have multiple parts to solve were very nice touch.<br />But that being said I would not pay to finish the game.kind of disappointing that it was more of a lost leader.
B00354YA4A|5.0|I was completely absorbed by this book. The first part draws you into a confined setting, a very hot day in a country house and the preparations for welcoming the son of the house who is about to arrive with a friend. It lets you see the scene from the perspectives of the  different characters in the house. Although McEwan focuses more on the internal lives of the characters than on external events, and devotes most of the attention to their impressions and reflections on what takes place around them, you feel the tension building steadily towards what certainly must become a disaster. The second part describes the dire consequences of these events, which grow out of the lively imagination of a young girl who half sees and half imagines what is happening in the house and tries, with good intentions, to put things right. McEwan ties everything together beautifully and elegantly in the last part where the young girl has grown old and has spent all the intervening years trying to reconcile herself with what she did as a child. I don't want to spoil anyone's reading experience by giving details. The book was rather different from what I had expected based on the descriptions, but it is certainly one of the better books that I have read. It is warmly recommended.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect so I watched the first show because it was free and I was hooked , I couldn't wait for the next episode I just kept downloading them one after another it took me two days to watch all 13. I hated to stop and was sad when it ended. It's a great show and all the actors are great. Kevin Spacey is wonderful and I figure this is exactly what goes on In Washington . It's wonderful!!!
B0060MYM7O|4.0|I was disappointed that season two didn't stay as close to the books as the first season did.  I hope the 3rd season is better.
B002M87W9K|5.0|One of my all time favorites, and certainly number 1 on my favorite musicals. Great songs, excellent acting, supper message.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|So I downloaded this game while it was offered as the free app of the day and I gotta say that I would actually pay for this game if I hadnt got it for free. I love this game! It is tons of fun and I actually dont mind playing it on mobile at all! I recommend this game to anyone who likes games like mario and little big planet.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love not being caught at the register not having enough money! I use it while online making purchases.  It's an easy app to use.
B003XE1D9W|3.0|Just the tiniest bit to small. I am hoping to stretch them a little bit.<br />Love the style.  Need more colors.
B0018CENUC|5.0|This collection of songs truly is a reflection of Toby Keith's greatest hits.  There isn't a song I don't want to listen to anywhere on it.  I love it!
B002PEP4SC|3.0|Light reading and entertaining.  Helps to pass the time, but nothing you can't put down when there is a better offer.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|This record gets better and better with every listen. I am not in this band's demographic at 60 years old, but they have a good sound going. A sound that does not feel forced or trite. When you have had a lot of birthdays you can easily get  jaded to some newer sounds. But this record soars ! After 4 or 5 casual listens, you will see what I mean. Enjoy.
B0028OF7TA|5.0|These CDs came within four days.  Each CD is in a double cardboard cover in a box.  The box looks like the shown picture.  Each CD cover has the original album picture and song list, etc.  In order to get the CD out of the cover, don't try to pull it out, shake it into your hand instead.  After you've done this a few times, it comes out easily.  I always make backups of my CDs, so the covers and box are excellent for the originals. The CDs are excellent in sound quality.  Michael's music is outstanding, as always, and this is an excellent buy. If you have some other albums with some of the songs, the songs you don't have are well worth the duplication.  In addition, I love the interview given by Michael's producer, Quincy Jones at the end of one album.  He gives an insight of what recording sessions were like with Michael.  This is the best purchase all the way around.
B007XNTDPA|4.0|Have been reading the Theo Boone one after another. A bit much repitition of background to characters that appear in all TB books ( so far).
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun and amusing game, and most of your friend s probably have it. The only thing that made me upset a few months ago was the game totally reset my highscore. But I think that was fixed though.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This was extremely fun. Definitely makes me use my brain. I am disappointed that are so little levels. It is very addictive once you figure how to go around the room. More levels please<br />!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a well written story that kept you thinking. In the end both of these characters are so broken that they could never be with anyone else.
0307719774|4.0|I am consistently writing papers for Grad school, but I miss writing for fun. I though this journal would be a nice and easy way to get into the habit of writing something every day. I just started, but I am so excited to start answering these questions and look forward to doing this year after year and seeing how I change. My only complaint is that the book is small, so it is hard to write in neatly. The space for writing is pretty small, I usually want more space for my answers.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie was not at all what I thought it would be, very disappointed in it, characters were not right for the parts
B00594XOZU|3.0|Kik wud be better answer if video was allowed and i cant share photos whickh os weird to me buh other than tht its good
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app of facebook works great on my kindle fire and I think the pictures and status' writing, ect. look just as good as if on a laptop. I dont really have complaints.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun addicting game. People with a lot of time on their hands with a lot of friends should definitely play this.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|So I was definitely sad to find out that all the music that was in the original series wasn't released in the collection, but I totally understand the reasoning. Besides that one little disappointment I am super pumped about having the series. Sweet deal for sure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. I play it everyday. I got all the trophies and beat a high score. I love this game!I wish I could give it 1,000,000 stars!
B007N8RULO|5.0|I gave this game a 5 star rating because it is one of the first games I felt so addicted to I couldnt put the game away. No problems with downloading or playing the game on my Kindle fire. The only thing I dislike about this is between changing out new hands of cards to play a new game there are pop ups or ads. Other than that I would definatly recomend this game to anyone who likes to exercise there brain a little play puzzles and strategize. If you like Solitaire, you will LOVE Spider Solitaire!
B003B02PEU|5.0|This was a good read. If any believe I somehow missed this book along the way. I have read all of John Gresham books and this was a real page turner.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|This is a very addictive game. It has good graphics and well made. It is worth 99&cent; and the more you play it the better it gets.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We have been watching this as a family and enjoy it.  Our two teenagers ask to watch the next episode right away.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This app is really cool. The details in the game are just like they were back in the arcades. They even created a joy stick on the screen to move the pacman around, or you can just use your finger. It is the same exact game and rules as it has always been. I recomend to anyone who has ever loved Pacman!
B003JTHXN6|4.0|Great book about the insight of this fun company, great for a light read or to gleam ideas how they have managed to come so far. I highly recommend doing a Zappos tour if you ever make it to Las Vegas.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Dan Brown started to right more about the historic events a leading you through the novel as a touristic guide
B001NLKT60|5.0|Excellent 2nd book to the trilogy.  Loved the intensity and the pathology behind the characters of all three books, especially Lisbeth's!
0525953728|5.0|I enjoyed the book as I thought it was honest and straight forward.  I also enjoyed the commentary on the politicians and media - how true and how frustrating they can be!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I choose this rating because I like that standing case. The first thing when I received the case I immediately put my Kindle fire HD in the case and I really liked the way it looks and the way I can read now without holding the Kindle Fire in my hand. First I had to hold the kindle in my hand when reading books but now that I have the standing case I can put it on a table and can read that is very comfortable for me because now I have my hands free.<br /><br />And what I really love about that standing case is the quality of the leather and the whole case and besides it is well protected with the filling inside the leather. I would say that it is first quality.<br /><br />I have used a protection for my first kindle and the leather is harder than this one it is a bit smaller and fits easy in any compartment of your suitcase but as the screen of the kindle fire is bigger I think that this standing case suits more.<br /><br />I really recommend this standing case for everyone who has a kindle fire and I am pretty sure he also will like it as much as I am.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I love this movie, and I love that I got it for a great price! I cannot wait to visit Paris someday.
B004G0SJU8|4.0|Well chosen actors with a petty predictable plot, but still with lots of food for thought. Would  watch it again.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|A 3.6 amp (max output) USB which splits up into 2 USB plug-ins of 2.1 and 1.5 amps.<br /><br />I've had both my iPhone 5 and my iPad 2 charging off of this one unit simultaneously! It's great when you only have 2 charging points in the car and one of those is powering my GPS. Now the other one has the Anker unit and I can keep all my electronics charged up at 100%.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was a great book!  I hope Emma writes a part 2.  This book was funny and the point of view, from a male perspective was refreshing.  Looking forward to more!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I had seen season one. I hope to see all seasons. All main characters are very good  and the writers are excellent.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Demick writes with clarity and compassion.  Her research and method of relating stories are commendable. This is an extremely timely book and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I am enjoying the book, Not finished yet, but the story keeps me coming back..<br /><br />I am telling all my friends to read it.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This was exactly what I was looking for and more in a light read to kick off the summer. I laughed out loud often and have already recommended it to several friends. You definitely need to have the same sense of humor as Fey to get the most out of this book.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I play a lot of Shadow Era, and have never played MTG before. The tutorials are really easy for new players to understand. The only reason I don't rate 5 stars is because there is little the trial account can do.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I liked this book a lot. However, the ending left me with to many unfinished questions. I hope she writes a fourth book. I don't like to be left hanging.
B000FC11A6|4.0|I haven't read any previous Stephenson books, and downloaded this one because a geeky friend, who loves and writes (and has published) sci-fi recommended it as an an Amazon kindle free deal. I'm not sure I would have purchased it otherwise, as the blurb does not describe the sort of book that would normally attract me. I am very glad that I took the chance on it!<br /><br />It is very long, without a doubt, and it includes much elaboration on some very geeky subjects, including cryptographic methods and mathematics, so those whose eyes glaze over when these subjects are mentioned will probably not enjoy it. Many reviewers have expressed frustration with these passages, labelling them unnecessary diversions and indulgences. I enjoy exploring mathematical conundrums and so I didn't find them frustrating. Instead, I found them intriguing insights into the world and obsessions of his characters.<br /><br />The book comprises history, industrial mystery, a treasure hunt of sorts, and it spans the world. It tells two stories, that of the development of cryptography through WWII, and the quirky characters/mathematical geniuses involved in that enterprise; and the story of some modern-day computer geeks and innovators, who are equally obsessive about computer coding, and crypto-coding in particular.<br /><br />The two seemingly unconnected stories gradually come together, as we learn that the modern-day (okay, late 1990s) cast of characters includes direct descendants of those in the WWII plotline. It becomes an industrial whodunnit, as we seek to find the connections, with some nice little Ah-ha! moments. What's not to like?<br /><br />We follow three families, essentially: the Waterhouses, the Gotos, and the Shaftoes. The lives of the representatives of all three families were interwoven in WWII strand, and then - because that is the way the world turns - their descendants' lives come together again. I really enjoyed the gradual unfolding of this. The two Waterhouses, grandfather and grandson, I loved especially, as I have a soft spot for slightly socially awkward mathematical geniuses, and Stephenson did a great job in providing us an insight into their quirky inner lives and motivations. The characters are beautifully drawn, and several times I laughed out loud in recognition of their perspectives and doings and obsessions.<br /><br />Stephenson writes well; his language is a delight and there's an understated humour threaded throughout the telling. The climax is a soft one. There are no bells and cymbals; and at first I was disappointed, but the next day I reflected on it and realised that no more is necessary. We can fill in those gaps - no need for the writer to laboriously spell it all out for us. The two story lines have come together; we know who did what, and we can follow the final threads to predict what happens next. For Stephenson to have elaborated on it would have been anti-climatic.<br /><br />I decided on four stars rather than five because I will not be in a great hurry to re-read it, but I do consider it a keeper. It is not a rollicking adventure, and it is not an 'easy' book to read - the language and the mathematical/cryptographic elaborations require attention - yet it's a satisfying journey.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|I think you shouldn't buy it and waste your money I will go get vice city<br />ASP so what it's better
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really liked this book. There are many surprises.<br />I would recommend this book to people who like action and romance.

B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I cant stop playing it. ive been playing it for over a year and it still hasn't gotten old, BUY IT PPL!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You the face they have for this app it's the exact same one I get when I'm told to put it down, cause then I'm like “ no you don't understand I was just about beat my high score when tripped on this stupid rock and I only one mission to complete to be able to finish this level just a few more minutes that's all I need ,ok!&#34; Trust this worth it the most thrilling part would have to be when your in the tunnel and your in this old mining site and you have to tilt your device to survive. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who has a device that doesn't have gyroscope I don't mean the food, but it's something in your device that detects movement so when tilt your device left or right the object on the scene does the same. Some phone probably don't have that setting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is so realistic and fun! It teaches responsibility through games!!!!! This game deserves two thumbs up! All ages will love this game!
B005S9EJ46|5.0|My daughter recommended the movie and it did not disappoint. The guys watched it to humor the girls, but they liked it as well.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This high-quality CD is not only entertaining, but it teaches about our culture and, unfortunately, is still relevant today in its message.  I use it, 10 minutes a day in addition to other materials and instruction, to teach English to non-native-English-speaking adults and teens to give them American culture, vocabulary not found in their textbooks, and to acquaint them with various accents and pronunciations to aid in their daily comprehension of conversations.  They learn the language faster and enjoy learning at the same time.  The CD is perfectly created and works well in the classroom setting for my use and needs.  I also never get tired of seeing it myself, either.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Seems pretty fun. Looks nice and real. Stays fun with all types of mini games. You can compete and eventually get more horses.
B00004RFCM|5.0|For the Series as a whole: it is a fun and fast paced show, probably because each season has so few episodes. It is funny and if you love drama it always has the too. There is a girl who is like each major type of women so you always have someone to connect to.<br /><br />For the DVDs Set: The box is so easy to break. The box was slightly breaking at the seem when it was shipped to me, by the end of the first week the two halves of the box were apart and they can't be fixed because it is three pieces of plastic barley glued together. It is a very cheap box, I suggest you invest in a dvd book if you want them to be safe.<br /><br />About the episodes of Season 1<br />Sex and the City Season 1 Review:<br /><br />\\"Sex and the City\\": The Sex and the City Pilot \\"Sex and the City\\" is probably the best pilot I have ever seen. It is was interesting, had a great rhythm, I loved the way she interacted with the audience, and it followed the first three articles featured in the book so very well.<br /><br />The girls looks a little older in the pilot than the series, which is odd because it was pilot and is filmed long before episode two.<br /><br />I thought that this episode was Sarah Jessica-Parker's best hairstyle in the series. It fit her face perfectly.<br /><br />I wasn't a fan of Charlotte wearing glasses, and her hair in the pilot, they were trying too hard to make her look the same age as the other girls.<br /><br />\\"Models and Mortals\\": First of all, I know that some people find beautiful women to be shallow but just because a girl is thin and beautiful doesn't mean she is stupid, illiterate, or lazy. Not all girls uses beauty to get what they want in life.<br /><br />Also the final statement by Mr. Big about women, so many people read into that as that you can't be beautiful and funny, but there are tones of funny girls who are beautiful.<br /><br />I was also offended by the TV art where he filmed all those women without permission. I also I work with models at lot in my profession and I have to say I have never worked with a model would slept around all the time, nor have I met more than 1 or 2 who were dumb.<br /><br />I think this episode unappreciated the work and dedication it takes to become a model. You have to work more than one job most of the time, waitress work is the most common, you have to take your free time to rush back and forth across town to meet with designers, most of whom will make you try on tons of clothing, critique everything about you, and then not hire you. It takes so much time, money, and dedication, if someone was really lazy and unintelligent they couldn't become a model.<br /><br />\\"Bay of Married Pigs\\": The Bay of Married Pigs was a fairly good episode. I found some of the incidents in the episode beyond humorous.<br /><br />The idea of there being a cold war between Marries and Singles is a great plot for the episode. I feel that cold war in real life as well and I think it is an important issue to cover.<br /><br />Samantha's part of the episode seems untrue to her personality. I felt like it was poor writing on the staff for this episode.<br /><br />The format of the episode was okay, but I do wish that there would be more story lines that branch off for the other characters, but it was centered around Carrie and Miranda instead of all four, as it usually is.<br /><br />I felt weird about Miranda's part of the story, the way she treated her fix up wasn't right, she was nice enough to her, but she just used her in the end.<br /><br />\\"Valley of the Twenty-Something Men\\": I enjoyed this episode a lot more than most of the episodes in Season 1. The idea of dating younger men is really hip among contemporary projects since the late 90's. I think it is because we are becoming more open about relationships and realizing that gender and age don't really matter when you lust for or love someone.<br /><br />I thought that the realization Carrie has about men being a drug was the best part of the episode. It was that moment in which the audience realized with her that it isn't about their age, their job, or even if they like you back, it is about the fact that all romantic relationships make you feel like you're floating on air and that feeling is addictive.<br /><br />Carrie seemed to be dating the younger man for validation in herself though, where as Miranda just wanted someone who wouldn't challenge her. I think the reasons behind the girl's choices in men where a little unreasonable and over the top, but it wouldn't be SATC if there wasn't something drama-queen like in the story line.<br /><br />\\"The Power of Female Sex\\": This episode was actually a pretty good one, even though the ideal of the story is women using sex to get what they want out of life. It wasn't the topic that was fun, it was the reality in what happened that was fun.<br /><br />I enjoyed the fact that the beautiful French man thought of Carrie as a hooker the whole time and that Carrie thought she was falling in love with a romantic foreigner.<br /><br />The conversation between the girls that morning was over the top though, I felt like they were trying to hard to make a feminist statement with the discourse between Miranda and Samantha. Samantha's statement was something that a strong women who owned her own company would never make, and it seemed like they only had her say the line to insight a fight about women's rights. The show itself was a statement about how women can be strong and take care of themselves, they didn't need to add more atop of it.<br /><br />\\"Secret Sex\\": When watching this episode I could feel the male influence that had just joined the series. The idea that there are women in the world that men have sex with and don't want others to know about is upsetting. The episode made it sound like every man in the world had one and that it was a normal thing.<br /><br />The way that Carrie reacted to the situation, just assuming that she was the secret set of Mr. Big was stupid. She freaked out about nothing and showed up drunk? I would have dumped her on the stop if I were him.<br /><br />All things considered I felt the episode was poorly written, and the relationships mentions in it where very stereotyped.<br /><br />\\"The Monogamists\\": This episode didn't do it for me. I love Sex and the City, but this episode just was awful. It was another drama-queen episode instead of something fun and fresh. I don't know if it is just me, but Mr. Big and Carrie had so many episodes together when they were dating that were annoying and upsetting.<br /><br />The way Carrie reacted upset me the most, she knew he was dating other women and yet she got together when him again at the end of the episode? The way she let Mr. Big walk all over her all the time made me feel like she was weak not a good role model, she couldn't make a relationship work and yet she wrote advice on them?<br /><br />Charlotte's part of the episode was really great, though. I felt like a ton of women could relate to her relationship problem. She didn't want to do something and he wasn't okay with that, and I'm sure every women has something different that they don't wish to do that comes between them and a man who pretends to be perfect.<br /><br />The idea that there aren't men who want to be monogamous was just wrong though, I've met plenty of them, I also lived a small town in the mid west that was mostly Christian and that valued being married forever and frowned on divorce.<br /><br />\\"Three is a Crowd\\": This was the first episode in which you really got all four of them's stories at the same time, which was the hallmark of the series and what made the audience love it so much.<br /><br />Carrie's part of the story was frustrating. She through such a fit about Mr. Big having been married in the past. I felt like going in meeting the wife under false pretenses was lame on her part, how Shallow was she? Okay, he was married and he didn't tell her before them, but reallyshe didn't ask. How would she have reacted if he told her on the first date? And, he left his wife and she was still acting like he wasn't his wife and not her.<br /><br />Charlotte's part of the episode was great, it was one of Charlotte's best episodes. I felt like she wasn't a prude for a moment and it made me like her more. I may have never liked Charlotte if it wasn't for this episode. I had to say though, the guy who was dating her was just using her for sex and he wanted a three-way because he wanted to have someone else to sleep with before he left her.<br /><br />Miranda's part of the episode was downright funny. She has the same kind of reaction that I probably would have had when her friends didn't want to have sex with her. I don't think she wanted to sleep with them, she just wanted to feel beautiful. I think that her answering that ad and then leaving was little over the top though, she should know she is beautiful just the way she is.<br /><br />Sam's part of the episode was pretty laid back for Sam. She usually is so much more fun and interesting but her sleeping with a guy and then the wife wanting to be part of the relationship, that was a-typical.<br /><br />\\"The Turtle and the Hare\\": This episode of SATC was a great episode, not because of the humor but because of how true to life it was. I think addressing the fact that most people don't marry for love was a bold call on the writer's part and very relate able.<br /><br />Sam's part was the most relate able, she thought that she could change a man into what she wanted in a relationship,and I watch women do that all the time and wonder why they keep failing. I think it was a learning experience for her viewers.<br /><br />Carrie's reaction to the situation was over the top again. The more I watch SATC the more I realize how much of a drama-queen she is. I think she enjoys ruining her relationships.<br /><br />\\"The Baby Shower\\": This was a very funny episode, it always makes me laugh, no matter how many times I watch it.<br /><br />Carrie's part of the story was fun, I think all women feel that way when they miss a period. For the firs time in a while I didn't think Carrie was over reacting to something in her relationship with Mr. Big<br /><br />Sam's part of the story made me wonder about the writers. When I think of Sam I feel like she has an ego and great self-esteem but this episode made it seem like she doesn't have any and that she sleep around to hide that.<br /><br />Charlotte's part of the story was sad, and very real. I felt like Lily was a horrid friend, doing what she did. I really wanted Charlotte not to give up because Lily stabbed her in the back to make herself look better<br /><br />Miranda's part of the story was so placid, it felt like she really didn't have a story. That part about her Dog Pepper was terrifying.<br /><br />\\"The Drought\\": This episode was so funny, everyone's part of the story just made me want to laugh and most of season 1 wasn't that funny, it was drama, drama, drama.<br /><br />Carrie's part of the episode was just over the top. She fart, she is human and she (as the Drama Queen she is) thought that Mr. Big was going to leave her over it. I though it was funny that she had to paint her house to not go to his house and jump him. She kept reading into everything.<br /><br />Miranda's part of the story was so funny, the guy outside the movie store and the gummy bears. I felt bad for her, but at the same time I wanted to know how funny she would act at 5 months.<br /><br />Charlotte's part of the story was also funny. She though that having a physical relationship wasn't important, until she couldn't have it. The ways she tried to change her situation were just so humorous<br /><br />Sam's part of the story was cute. The idea that someone like Sam would be having sex was just out of place, and the idea that she thought she could do it was just so unrealistic to her character. Each moment had me really laughing hard.<br /><br />The couple outside of Carrie's window was insane, I keep wondering if that was filmed for this project or if it was a clip from an adult movie.<br /><br />\\"Oh Come All Ye Faithful\\": I hated this episode. It was the worst one for all of season 1, which is saying a lot because this is one of my top 10 favorite TV shows<br /><br />Carrie's Part of the episode upset me beyond words. I spent a whole season dealing with all the drama that was Carrie and Mr. Big's relationship and then she dumped him for something so normal. Why would he have her meet his mom before he was ready to marry her or movie in with her?<br /><br />Miranda's part of the episode made me feel awkward, the way the guy acting during their love scenes made me blush and it is hard to make me blush. It was kind of creepy, I didn't get why she would date such an odd man who was way below her league.<br /><br />I think that at the end when the relationship between Carrie and Mr. Big ended I was actually happy. It really takes all 6 seasons to fall in love with Mr. Big if you don't like Macho Egocentric men with commitment issues. I felt like Carrie finally had a change to get a real guy and it made me want to keep watching the show.she didn't ask. How would she have reacted if he told her on the first date? And, he left his wife and she was still acting like he wasn't his wife and not her.<br /><br />Charlotte's part of the episode was great, it was one of Charlotte's best episodes.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love challenging games that keep you thinking. Please keep the levels coming. I can't wait to keep playing so please hurry with more
B000AP04NI|5.0|I enjoy watching it myself, but I also use it, 10 to 15 minutes at a time in supplementing teaching English to non-native English speakers to give added vocabulary not in the normal classroom material and to acquaint them with other accents and pronunciation  (e.g. &#34;larn&#34; instead of &#34;learn&#34; and &#34;git&#34; instead of &#34;got&#34;) to aid in their comprehension in every day conversations with English speakers.  I do the same for British accents and terms.  It is a great, interesting, fun wasy to learn English or to relaxe for awhile.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think this game is pretty fun. I mean it's hard at the beginning but after a while it gets really easy and fun. In a way, this game is l like a puzzle
B006RXQ800|4.0|The story telling, acting and production are excellent. Not for the faint of heart however as this movie is extremely violent. If you can get past the violence, you'll appreciate the performances of the numerous 'name' actors. As usual, Daniel Day Lewis was terrific.
1615239502|5.0|Kitchen House will be one of my all time favorites book ever read.  I absolutely loved it from beginning to end.  I would  highly recommend this book.
0811871258|1.0|Like the title says, not worth it. The placement of some of the artwork made it difficult to view. One of the artwork was broken up into multiple pages, again, making it difficult to view.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the best sequel to Temple Run. I love the new features like the zipline and the minecart. It's amazingly addictive and not hard to play.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|He's the manly Tommy Lee! This has his usual amazing acting talent and the character is a tough guy with a decent core - perfectly suited to Mr. Lee.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is tons of fun and keeps your brain working. I like the hints and trying to figure out all the tasks in order to advance to the next level.
B00B4ZN6A6|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it and I'm glad it is finally available on blu. Haven't had a chance yet to examine special features but to me it is worth the cost just to have this movie in this format. It is a little chick-flickish and I usually shy away from that but all the actors in my opinion do such a great job telling the story.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|love the films but the sound was not adjustable.  I did not want to return it, but I was unsatisfied with the sound
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars except that it isn't finished. As I neared the end I realized there is still so many loose ends and so little time left to conclude this book and then.... it didn't end. Otherwise, I'm still hooked and think it is fantastic and love everything else about it. She is a captivating writer and I read everything she writes. She puts you in the moment with the characters. I can't wait for the next book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|When I got this, I thought it would be a really slow, complicated game. But then, I played it for a while, and it was so much fun and really challenging! I recommend it
B00DGN51O8|3.0|We sat down on a rainy, stormy evening with nothing else to do and picked this movie to watch.  No regrets, it was entertaining and even a bit fun to see and old story brought to life.  Classic morals - good vs. evil and outcome - good overcomes evil.  It's meant to be entertaining and it accomplishes that goal.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Well acted series.  The plot keeps you guessing as to how the situations will turn out.  Looking forward to watching the whole series.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun to play I love looking for the hidden items but the mystery manor adds a lot more interesting story to the game.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|The second season of The Borgias definitely ups the intrigue, violence, and sex. Rodrigo has now secured his position as Pope, but he is by no means safe as Cardinal Della Roverre continues to work against him from the shadows. Lucrezia continues to develop and mature into a young woman and mother and comes to see her family and the world for what it is. The jealousy and tension between Cesare and Juan increases as Cesare continues to be forced into a cardinal's robes by his father while Juan is made Duke of Gandia and head of the papal armies.<br /><br />This season is a very strong follow up to the first and in many ways surpasses it. I loved watching Guilia and Lucrezia take on more active roles and the relationship between Juan and Cesare grow darker. There are several turning points that will clearly affect the characters greatly in the future and ultimately change who they are.<br /><br />As with the first season, I can't recommend this show enough to anyone who loves period shows or just intrigue and drama. The Borgias is a smart, well-acted show.
1592402690|5.0|Fascinating inside view of the Beatles' lives,recordings,and miscellaneous aspects of the music world and culture of the time.Illuminates numerous key aspects of the songs and contributions of each individual in the band, and their songwriting and musicianship.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game.  I don't want to put it down when working on a level.  Simple game but challenging.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Sure, Tarantino's movies are violent and there is gore aplenty in this one too.  And yes it is a fantasy, an &#34;I wish this was the way it happened&#34; story about the defeat of Hitler and his minions.  So, yes it is fictionalized history, but it is SO satisfying to watch it in a film done so very, very well in every respect.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|a start of a different type of adventure after reading different fantasy books. Would recommend for teenage reading rather than adults.
0743299795|5.0|After reading this book I started to study Supply Chain Management as my profession.<br />That said, this book is a simple read and a great introduction to manufacturing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It gets your mind thinking. Great for kids. Recommend for any age!!!!!! Please get! Will suit in any occasion when bored and child is bugging you. Lol. Just get and you'll be happy that u got it.....
B000H5TVJY|5.0|Waiter: Would you like to hear today's specials?<br />Patrick Bateman: Not if you want to keep your spleen.<br /><br />If the above quote made you chuckle, then this movie is for you. Satire at its finest.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and wanted to own the movie to watch it again.  I was not disappointed.  DVD arrived in good order and in a timely fashion.  Great movie.  Highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|1.0|My wife bought this on my account so that she could read it when we went on a long flight to Asia. She could only get half way through it. I wish I knew how to return a kindle book...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Amazing storyline with incredible actors.I loved the scenery,the architecture and the background music score.It's one of the best PBS series that I've ever seen.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|There's only 10 rooms but fun and some what challenging more rooms to come in the near future try it you'll like it<br />Kevin  Denton n.c.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|With all the other products out there, i basically threw a dart at the board, and hit a bulls eye. Plain and simple, fast and reliable, a great mouse at a great price! Thanks Anker!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This was a good one. Would recommend to anyone. Priced a bit high.  $5. Would have gotten 5 stars if priced better.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|In light of the 6/29/2013 passing of martial arts icon Jim Kelly - who became a star thanks to this film - I hope Amazon marks down the price of this collector's edition down from it's current advertised price of $35 bucks.  With Kelly's passing, I desperately want to add this to my collection...but $35 bucks is a bit too steep at the moment.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I can't explain in words! I'm sad that there's no more to read, off to Heros of Olympus! People say I'm over exaggerating, but this is my favorite book of the series! There's many many surprises, deaths, and shockers. I cried at a few parts but it's the best yet!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I just cant seem to stop playing my daughter got me hooked on this game I find myself playing it the time...
B00BIR381W|5.0|I am in love with this show, I ended up watching a disc a night and finishing in a week. this show is so addictive, a bit scary (because I'm kind of a baby) but it's amazing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is AMAZING! I love how interactive you have to be and how realistic it truly is. there aren't very many games like this.
B00CLNVOL8|1.0|I love the fact that I can order videos over Amazon Prime, but it seems more often then not quit playing with an error and a message that says, &#34;try another title.&#34; Maybe, I don't want to after all. I rented the picture I wanted. After you have spent the money, there is no recourse or refund either---even if the picture doesn't work!  Please fix this issue as the convience is great, but the ability is awesome.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The weird part is that I had two kindles, but then my dog jumped on one of them and broke it, and they both had a problem where I would tap and play it, then it would back out to the home screen. I had already deleted and redownloaded it on the first kindle.<br /><br />don't blame the game,  I'd blame this piece of crap of a amazon product.
B009FZFONO|2.0|I bought it during my trial of Amazon Prime, but declined the &#34;membership&#34; and now am denied access to the episode I paid for. This is a real drag for a WD fan, as it is the only episode I failed to record on the DVR, and one of the best.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The framing of the story takes a LOOOOOOOng time. Once the story gets going a good pace it skip ALOT of stuff and leapfrogs in time. After the slow start, the leapfrogging was a little irritating and the ending was abrupt. It's almost like someone trying to milk a short story into novel length and then saving the rest in order to make a trilogy. I think I'll skip the next one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would recommend this to someone who likes a twist and enjoys a long read. If you like John Green other books you'll simply love this one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I think the series has kept well to the times and it was thru a difficult time that this Season found us, on the other side of the war, with so much that had happened there. Then so many pivotal moments in this season as well, Wedding, jilted, pregnancy, prostitution, death and so much more. Great Series all the way around.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The cast is superb, story line interesting and Downton Abbey has just the right mix of drama and comedic relief to appeal to most adult audiences.
B004ZZS4CC|1.0|In this digital age it's easy to find that your paying for a book and only getting a short story. Lots of typos and poor editing.<br /><br />There needs to be a new standard created to compare to for relative &#34;depth&#34; or &#34;size&#34; of the book. In order to help digital purchasers of books since your not lifting it off the shelf and thumging through the acutal novel anymore.<br /><br />A standard could be...say....on standard paperback size paper; type size X pages that would be in that book (12pt x 294 = 3528 or '35') I don't know but I feel ripped off sometimes.<br /><br />This book was so short I don't even remember what it was about.
145470246X|5.0|this book is great and has nice designs. But I'm just learning how to bead so I will not be using it for some time till I do better work.
1939416019|1.0|This book was either written by a 15 year old or for 15 year olds.  The level and quality of the writing are confounding and very simplistic.  The plot is very derivative and very frustrating at times.  I can not recommend this book
125000098X|5.0|Best Kept Secret - Loved it . Can't wait for the next book in this series.  Hope it is printed soon.
B00CJ1PXNW|5.0|So glad I found these guys by chance. Absolutely incredible group! Buy this album! They have opened me up to a whole other genre of music.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought this game was going to be boring but I was way wrong. I love it, it just needs more levels. I was very disappointed when I got to the end in such a short amount of time.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was a terrific book. Flynn is a great writer. She keeps your attention and interest throughout the entire book!
B005H0CBZ0|4.0|Really enjoy this series by Diana Gabaldon. She stays true to her characters and fills her stories with history. Wonderful epic romance series
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is a great way of solving mysteries.  Lots of clues that keep you guessing. Great way to spend a family afternoon.<br />_
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Awesome.  I can not wait for the sequel!  it is  a great combination of all the characters from the different movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My friend showed me this app and I got addicted!!! Eventually they put it on the Kindle Fire and now I play it ALL the time it's an amazing app and kid friendly. Just amazing.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is the best game in the world to me because it gives you chances to unlock people trophies boards and beat other people high scores
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is supper fun and addicting :D I play it every day. the only thing. don't like is that rarity is 30 gems :/
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Love the series, keeps me looking around the corner for the next surprise!  Cant wait to see how it all ends!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is good for seeing local weather information and can add additional favorite locations.  The weather radar is helpful, too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game it is exciting and fun.  I hope people who just got it will like it too. You can name your horse and do championships with it .
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|This tv show is great.  I still like the original series better but this one is good and there are more seasons to watch.
B00CWVFZ8W|3.0|This was an entertaining and intriguing movie.  The filmography was very good and was well put to together.  The down side of the movie is that it has an uncanny resemblance to the Twilight series.
B00AKYRCNY|4.0|This app is good for entertaining my 2 year old grandson who loves cars and trucks.  The noises that accompany the puzzle piece's movement adds to his enjoyment.
B008M721MS|1.0|Just about every time I get logged out of Skype, I put in my correct information in, over and over, and it wants to tell me my username/password are incorrect. Then, I have to go through the whole process of the email and sometimes when I request an email, it doesn't come for DAYS. No. It hasn't happened just once or twice. It's happened 5-10 times. I've had difficulty logging in at least 30 times since I've had the Skype app. Which is probably about 2 months. I am tired of going through this crap. I've even had to make several accounts because of never get an email multiple times.
B00B5AP7NY|4.0|The movie was enjoyable for the whole family. My 4 year old loved it because it was so much like the game.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|fast paced and easy to understand.  Fun to pass time.  Not very challenging but the effects are interesting. Recommend for older children and adults.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Loved how she moved between the day of the accident and the past.  Cleverly written and captivating read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very great and interesting app. Very challenging puzzles. I played for hours when I picked it up.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. There was never a dull moment. Definitely will be reading the rest of the series.
B007IWG3WC|1.0|Well, I like sharks, and I like thrillers, but this one was so bad I had to turn it off after about 20 minutes. Terrible acting, terrible plot (super sharks trained and used to grow cancer treatment cells??) and terrible movie. Please don't waste your time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was a page turner. Couldn't stop reading and finished it in less than 2 days. Can't wait for the next book.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|&#34;We sleep safely in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would harm us.&#34; Chris Kyle was one of those rough men, and this brief look at the world through his eyes should make us doubly thankful that such men exist. It should also remind us that the purpose of armed forces is to kill those who would kill us, and point out the obvious foolishness of trying to use them as a laboratory for social engineering.<br /><br />Chris Kyle was a superb killer, and proud of it, and also a devoted husband and father. The supreme irony, not covered in the book, is that he was murdered by a troubled fellow soldier he was trying to help.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers  is awesome because the updates are always changing to better ones and they give you offers for free stuff and goals to reach  ......download it!!!!!
B008P3SPVU|5.0|I'm a sucker for &#34;good teacher&#34; movies anyway, but this one is good because it's based on a true story, which makes it more poignant, I believe.
B005FFW46S|5.0|I have read Terry Prachetts books for 20 years now.  He is, as ever funny, but with a &#34;humanity&#34; that really shines through on this one.  If you read any other Discworld novel, you will like this on.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book is thrilling, sad, beautiful, haunting, scary, homey, exciting, and above all a terrific read.<br /><br />I can't remember the last time a novel has elicited that many feelings out of me.<br /><br />This is an adult version of one of Neil's YA novels.  It's a bit Coraline (something scary happening to a child's parents), a bit Graveyard Book (a child having an adventure with the help of magical friends), and a bit American Gods (the protagonist learning a secret history).  Having said that, Ocean is it's own story, and what a story it is.<br /><br />It might seem small, but the story is quite epic in its scope.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|This is such a refreshing story. It's characters were so real and the story was so vivid. Just beautiful!! I would recommend it to anyone!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The beginning of the end of an era...change is inevitable, DA shows its audience the good, the bad and the ugly. Great acting!
B000JMKNV0|3.0|Usually I will read the book of a movie I like. And usually that book will provide additional entertainment, insight, or information, that will bring an overall greater enjoyment to the story. Unfortunately, this was not the case with Shutter Island. One would be served just as well if they stuck with the movie. Just as enjoyable, in a much more condensed format.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Fantastic book. Highly recommend. I am a James Reader and it gives me lots of inspiration and though process.<br /><br />What I like about him is his sincerity as he writes he does not hide anything. He's life is an open book and this book tells a lot about it and for me was very useful.<br /><br />Keep the
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|This is a great movie.  It works for all ages. Humor that all can understand, and has a good moral ending
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Completely different (in a good way) than the movie.  It doesn't really read like a story per say, more like a bunch of stories.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|this is a perfect mtg game expect on my s3 I don't get online multiplayer :(( that's all I want and need!
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|I had to give it 5 stars.  While the entire movie would rate a 4-star, I gave it 5 just for the ending.  Their performance at the end had me rewinding several times just to see it again.  Fat Amy was the best!!!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love this game because it's challenging and has lots of choices for games. I give it an A+  do you have any more like this?
B0011Z51T8|5.0|Jack white rocks on this album and it has some very original songs. I would definitely buy another white stripes album in the future.
0399213015|5.0|This book is a must-have for any child's book collection. I saw that it was a mini book but did not pay close attention to the dimensions- it really is very small. It's about the size of my hand. The illustrations are beautiful, the page cutouts are the same, and the text is all there. This may be a good copy to keep in your car/purse/diaper bag. I can see it coming in handy in that way. That said, I'll probably end up buying the full-size version separately.
1439127700|5.0|A unique insight into the most exclusive club in the world.  What's most interesting is how these men generally support and aid one another regardless of party affiliation or ideology.  There are exceptions of course, but the awesome responsibility of the office is something only those who have occupied it can understand, and the common thread among all of them is love of country, and a desire to see the office of president upheld and preserved.  The book also reveals a lot about these men's true personalities - something their public personas don't necessarily reveal.  Of course some relationships are more riveting than others - Nixon as a candidate, a president, and an ex-president is fascinatingly Machiavellian - but every chapter is captivating in its own way.  You'll never look at any one of these men exactly the same way again.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Arnold Schwarzengger starts a small town sheriff with barely nothing to do except for the day the bad guys came to his town. There's a mix of humor and action in this film. It was entertaining all through out the movie. All in all it was worth seeing!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is so much better than the first one because of the graphics and different obstacles. It's really fun and very easy to learn
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I am Ready to get started on the second book and then move on the the third of the trilogy
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I really felt like Day let us down.. I believe it hard, honest living and she completely manipulated her readers in a ploy to make more money by creating more books for the story.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Excellent case!  Great looking, sturdy and functions as described.  I have had several people tell me how great it looks and how they wished they had gotten this brand.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I am a kid and I love this the dog is grumpy so you can laugh about him getting a little angrier and it is a lot of fun:)
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I listen to this album pretty much everyday.  Their style is all over the place and generally really upbeat.  Totally worth every penny
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love games like this<br />Hope more game will be available.  This type of games are very habit forming.  Love it
B005KAH7QU|1.0|yeah, it was interesting..<br />Maybe it should have had more of a plot that made sense or that could be figured out at some point
B00D2K40WY|5.0|It is fun!<br />I like it a lot and play quite often and make cool outfits 4 the princesses to wear and they look so cute!!!!!
B003VANOFY|2.0|I loved the headphones for the first 3 months. Then the LED lights went out and the mic wasn't muted even when I thought it was. I got used to walking around the house in between WoW rbg queues with them on and the mic muted, but that made for an embarrassing moment when I went to the bathroom with the mic in the fully upright position, which was supposed to mute the mic, but didn't and my whole group got to hear me pee. Eff you, Logitech -_-
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I love this series, it gets better in each episode. This is a must see series, would recommend to anyone
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this is the best game out there.  I love it.  you don't need to spend a lot of money to play it but you do have the few that spend hundreds and then dominate it.  its an awesomegame though
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Every three weeks I have to remove the app because of freezing.  And it is so slow. I would not recommend this app to anyone.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Best graphics. So much fun that I'm addicted to it. When you rescue animals and save there species you get awesome bonuses and unlock some cool surprises. I totally recommend this game for anyone who wants to have fun and and learn about animals.
B0094M2S5A|4.0|Old movie that I had never seen but always wanted.  I really enjoyed the this movie, the actors like Glenn Close and Kevin Kline among others were great in this emotional drama.  I recommend it if you have long time friends that you cherish, you will be able to relate.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Wild is a story of a woman's journey to self discovery while hiking.  Although I enjoyed the read, I did find it tiresome at points and sometimes self indulgent.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The last week the application has said dry weather will continue but it has been raining fire the last 3 days.  It also says i'm in Topeka Kansas but I am in Florida and have never been to Topeka
B007MNV5WU|3.0|Kids can take this one or leave it. They don't completely understand the game itself and tire of it quickly. it may be they are too young and will grow into the game!
1451668945|4.0|I enjoyed this book but I think it was a little drawn out on the storyline<br />with everything being solved in the last chapter or two and not a very<br />suspenseful book throughout !
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Building you Book for Kindle is a basic how to.<br />It delivers specific information that will teach you just how to do it.<br />It was just what I was looking for.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Have enjoyed watching this series as I stumbled across it.  Very interesting characters and something different to watch on tv these days.  Highly recommend it!
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|Entertaining read about life and detective work in Botswana.  My book club decided to read this book and we all enjoyed the light reading, and had fun marveling at our lady detective's success.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I'd had the ending spoiled for me, but it was still an enjoyable read. It's pretty much scifi canon at this point right?
B008602KQI|3.0|I could name a hundred films I'd rather discuss with teenagers. But those aren't films most teenagers would freely choose to watch. This is. At least where female teens and tweens are concerned. And smart teen males will want to be knowledgeable about the films girls like to see if they're eager to make friends with girls. Dragging dates to Fast & Furious XXXV will not do the trick unless you're dating Danica Patrick...<br /><br />Hunger Games is good discussion fodder because it's very, very popular; it's part of a trilogy of books and a coming tetralogy of films; and it has enough good points to build on (along with bad points to deal with).<br /><br />How you approach it depends on the teen, of course. There are people who respond to any attempt at discussion with idiocies like \\"Why do you have to analyze everything? Why can't you just enjoy it?\\" People who say this may not be stupid (though that is a distinct possibility). They may be intellectually insecure or lazy, and trying to conceal this in an application of \\"offense is the best defense.\\" If the kid is young enough you can make a post-discussion a precondition for letting them see \\"Hunger Games.\\" If they're older...well, you may just have a dud on your hands. Sorry about that.<br /><br />I do know people who consider any discussion of works of art a waste of time because they think the purpose of most art is frivolous--killing time, frothy entertainment. This can be worked with, though it's still hard. But let's get back to \\"Hunger Games\\" in particular.<br /><br />Since I'm talking about talking about this film, now I'm going to include spoilers freely. Don't go on until you've seen it unless you don't care. Forewarned...<br /><br />There are two equally valid ways to talk about a movie like \\"Hunger Games:\\" as a film, and as philosophy--that is, as a reflection on life.<br /><br />As a film, \\"Hunger Games\\" is an example of how you can tackle turning a book into a film--and in particular how you can make a film that coheres as a movie while at the same time leading to more films in the series (every TV series faces this challenge).<br /><br />Practically speaking, a film can't be any longer than \\"Hunger Games\\" is. So what does your teen think of the choices the film makes in what to include from the book and what to leave out? If your teen thinks something left out should have been left in--such as, say, Rue's developing relationship with Catniss during the training period--what should be left out in order to make room for that?<br /><br />Then, considering what is the same in book and movie, what about the fact that Catniss winds up not having to kill anyone we like, or anyone defenseless whether we like them or not? She does have to make a tough decision when it comes to, in effect, being ordered to kill Peeta. But that's it. This is an example of a plot designed to look tough that actually is not so tough. What if she'd had to choose between killing Rue or Peeta? It could have easily worked out that way.<br /><br />Ask your teen what she would have done at each crucial decision point in Catniss's story. You can also see whether she caught the fact that Catniss doesn't love Peeta? She likes him, she's grateful to him for his acts of kindness earlier in their lives. But gratitude ain't love.<br /><br />Also, it seems like Catniss hadn't been teaching Primrose how to hunt. Why not? Would your teen have made that choice? If your teen had been in Primrose's position, would she have asked Catniss to teach her? [I'm only talking about the movie here.]<br /><br />Taking a step back, is this future society plausible? For example, if the Capitol City denizens are so decadent, who are the highly disciplined military/police forces? They aren't lounging around decadently. The Roman Empire wound up hiring \\"barbarians\\" for their military--who wound up taking over eventually. A college-bound teen might want to explore this to see what are the parallels between real empires like the Roman one and the world of Hunger Games.<br /><br />And what about the scientists, engineers and technicians needed to maintain a very, very advanced technological infrastructure? That all takes discipline and hard work, not dilettantish decadence. Where are these people?<br /><br />And, like, what are those killer dogs made of? CGI can't bite people. That's tech way beyond anything we can imagine.<br /><br />A lot of teens, fed on a rich diet of CGI-stuffed scifi/action movies, may not realize what's science and what's fiction. Your teen should realize that those lethal out-of-thin-air dogs represented tech waaay beyond most other stuff in the film. That doesn't make it invalid to use; but you should realize the difference, and so should your teen.<br /><br />Which brings us to using Hunger Games to help your teen learn about the art of movies. You can talk about casting, screenwriting, cinematography, lighting, sound, music, editing, CGI, direction, mise en scene--even to technical details like scene transitions (cuts, wipes, fade out/fade in). And you can talk about the Fourth Wall (that divides the audience from the \\"stage\\"). About POV (Point of View). Does Hunger Games ever break the Fourth Wall, intentionally or otherwise (it's intentional when the actor turns to the audience and addresses them directly; it's unintentional when the shadow of a boom mike drifts into view). What's Hunger Games' POV? Are we seeing everything through Catniss's eyes? (we aren't--but where and when are we not, and is that a good idea here?).<br /><br />What about the last fight on top of the Cornocopia, when the Evil Boy makes a little existential speech about knowing he's dying, regretting the fact that his whole life has been about training to be a killer, but thinking he might as well kill once more? Why did the screenwriter include that little speech? Why? Did it complicate things for Catniss, who has trouble killing anyway? Does it tell us more about this society? Does it make the Evil Boy a little sympathetic, and is that a good thing?<br /><br />Look at the credits at the end with your teen. See if she knows what the different jobs are. Look up the ones you don't recognize on Wikipedia or suchlike. Who's a Best Boy? A Key Grip? A Second Unit director? See what locations were used.<br /><br />Some say casting is 80% of a movie. What would the film have been like if they'd used someone besides Jennifer Lawrence as Catniss? I heard Chloe Grace Moretz wanted the part. Would she have been too young? She's one of the most athletic young female stars in Hollywood, though of course Lawrence is no slouch. But she's also, like, half a foot shorter. Would that have made a difference?<br /><br />It's not like Hunger Games is a towering masterpiece of a movie. It isn't terrible either, though. And assuming it's one of your teen's favorite movies, you can use it as a gateway to thinking about society, real world morality, the future, and filmmaking.e Roman one and the world of Hunger Games.<br /><br />And what about the scientists, engineers and technicians needed to maintain a very, very advanced technological infrastructure?

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Riordan does it again! Every book he writes is great and this one is no different, it really leaves you wanting to read more. I feel so bad for Percy and annabeth and I hope that the next book comes out soon so I can learn what happens to them.
B007SGM084|2.0|I was bored after the first book, but had heard such great things that I read on. Very repetitive. Didn't ever regain my interest.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love the show!  The books bring the characters to life and give you even more than on T.V.  Definitely worth reading!
0307744434|5.0|I found this book to be fascinating.  I liked the mysterious lives of all the circus participants.  It is definitely a must read book.
0345533054|5.0|\\"Gone for Good\\" was the first Coben novel I have read, and I loved it. I enjoyed the development of the story and was truly surprised by the ending. As a mystery reader, I have not been surprised like that in a long while. I was shocked I enjoyed it as much as I did because I am typically not interested in the topic of organized crime.<br /><br />I read \\"Tell No One\\" after \\"Gone for Good\\", and it was a bit disappointing. I will continue with the stand alone novels because the writing is superb.
0812984412|5.0|The novel Cloud Atlas is a craft of storytelling at its best!  To take the voices of a colonialist, an aborigine, a gay musical prodigy, a fabricated slave, and an escapee from a nursing home and weave them into the history of mankind is overwhelming.<br /><br />The theme of every action that a person does, good or bad, having repercussions for the future lays a heavy responsibility on each of us, but &#34;what is an ocean but a multitude of drops?&#34;
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|Well written and logical.<br />Would have liked some more Recipes in it though.<br />Easy to read and understand - the wife digested it and has started me on the way
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|The actors and photography are ok, but the script is standard Hollywood fare where you know from the start about the completely predictable \\"uplifting\\" ending.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely love this series!  I have dreamed about such happenings.  I never knew sci-fi was my thing.  Right up there with Orson Scott Card books.  Made me think.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST SERIES I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME, HOOKED THE FIRST TIME AND WATCH OVER & OVER.
B00AEFXL5W|4.0|This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray version of Breakfast at Tiffany's sparkles.  Apparently the movie was restored and remastered.  It looks like it was made yesterday.  Details are crisp, and colors are strong.  While there is some film grain in lower light shots, it is not distracting.  They did this one right.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game of Solitaire is set up to make the game easy, fun and full of tips and undos. I enjoy this set up. I like that you can leave your game and come back to it later.I like the tap and move the cards to the proper place. Right side deal is a must for me.I have used this format for over a year.If you like to play Solitaire this version is the best!!!
B000059PPN|5.0|OK, I admit it. That Bob kid is insufferably annoying! He's up (down?) there w/ that creepy kid in BURIAL GROUND in the annoyance department. However, HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY is otherwise a bleak, Fulci classic. Dr. Freudstein is one of the most chilling, disturbingly eeevil characters in any horror film. His mute, undead sadism is the stuff of nightmares! The infamous basement scene is filled w/ dark, claustrophobic doom! Yes, the plot is simplistic. Yes, Ms. MacColl is better in THE BEYOND. Still, once the doctor makes his appearance, all else is forgotten...
1781162646|5.0|Excellent story. One of those books that you can't put down. Keeps you wanting more. A great summer read. Have recommended to a number of people
B00B1EEKM8|4.0|This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray version of Jurassic Park is quite good.  The details are crisp; the colors are strong; and the sound is clear.  The special effects hold up surprisingly well considering the film is now twenty years old.  It is what you would hope for a sci-fi thriller like this one.  There is some film grain, but for the most part is not distracting.  About the only complaint that I have has to do with a few night scenes, which come across as gritty in the transfer.  But these are brief and hardly ruin the movie.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.
B0062QRTKA|4.0|Great animation.  Super cute.  Levels get harder as it goes on wasn't really to my liking but my 7 and 9 year old really liiked it.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|The movie is as good as the book. The casting is superb, with Danny DeVito at his best as the corrupt car salesman (what else?) father. The other actors/actresses while not well-known, are fantastic. The best thing about this movie is that even though it's old, it somehow doesn't seem dated. There is no foul language, no sexual overtones, and the \\"violent\\" scenes never turn out to hurt anyone. The only small caveat is that there are some scary scenes involving the evil school director, which will probably scare small (under 6) children. I also like this movie for those over 6 who are too \\"sophisticated\\" for cartoon movies \\"for babies\\".
B000FBJFSC|3.0|I'm not sure what to say about this book.  It is a book that stays with you - I read it over a month ago and still find myself thinking about it.  On one hand it is horribly depressing, the life these people had was just awful.  But I'm not sure if this is the talent of the author or just human nature, but much like the character you find yourself continuing to read, because something good has to happen eventually, right?  Doesn't it?  So like the character continues to plug on with his sorry existence, you plug on reading.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|A little slow with the start of the book.  It got better towards the middle of the book.  Ending left you hanging!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Love the game.  Hate the fact that you have to add money for more balls or lives.  Once out of lives you have to wait 30 min to play again.  But overall fun game easy to understand.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|I actually watched this movie out-of-sequence when it first came out.  So I think you can skip &#34;Before Sunrise&#34;, if you want to, and still get the gist of what happened there from the clues dropped in this movie.  I loved the natural way that Paris was the setting here and it was great to see how the actors have aged a little over the intervening 9 years.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|I'm not typically a Nicholas Sparks fan, a little too sappy for me on the whole.  However, I enjoyed this book.  This book was sort of &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34; with the storyline filled in more and the characters more developed.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Game of Thrones follows the books by the same name very accurately.  After reading the books, it was very easy to follow the names, action and see what characters really look like.  This is a very gripping epic and I found the scenery, characters and plot excellent!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like it better than some of the other virtual city games..it has faster rewards, more building options.  Addicting game!
B001NA6096|4.0|By watching this movie, you can live out your fantasy of &#34;what would have happened if I had reached out to that person on that traiin (or bus or whatever)...&#34;?  This movie is based on a cool concept and the follow-up in the other two movies (so far) -- Before Sunset and Before Midnight -- adds an interesting dimension of following this couple over time.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|My daughter bought the 2nd movie for Father's Day and we loved it so much that I wanted the first. The story is intriguing and the chemistry between Downey and Law is great!
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|There are moments that bring me back to the 70s.  Certainly, the album was designed to have it's moody periods.  The basic songs are growing on me.  The deluxe release tracks didn't take time for me to appreciate.  Tony's work sounds a lot like his other recent recordings and less like the early stuff,  Geezer is great as always, Ozzy's voice is pretty great too.  There is a moment where the percussion section when bongos are employed that left me wanting Mr Ward back but the drums are still good.<br /><br />If you are a Sabbath fan I say buy but to all shoppers I say buy the deluxe edition.  The melodies aren't as catchy as the early stuff but Ozzy does a knock out job with good range and force and Tony's playing is more technical or on par with his recent work.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|very touching episodes, showing how strong the family holds together. I especially love Maggie Smith's lines. She brightens up the whole show.
B005DC68NI|5.0|The book was very helpful since I am getting ready to self-pub.  was easy to read and with the additional information<br />at the end - was able to do a lot of my own research.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show and cannot wait for season 4. Romance, intrigue, comedy and set in a stylish era with perfect costuming and the oh so very English way of life! This show has it all. Perfection!!!
1607066017|3.0|Yes, I enjoy Vaughan's work.  Saga is also consistently rated highly everywhere I looked.  But I read it and I felt the story didn't hold my interest as much as the reviews justified.  It isn't a bad book.  The art is decent.  However, I don't quite understand the backstory or have much connection with the characters.  Maybe I need to read vol 2 but I probably won't.  There just wasn't enough for me to hold onto here.  Good but not as great as people are making it out to be.  No hooks to get me back.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I absolutely love it- It keeps me suuuper organized- i never have to worry about leaving another grocery list at home! because its on my phone! love it!
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I've had this game for many months.  I have it on my android and apple portable devices.  All you have to do to play is swipe with a finger to connect three or more icons to score.  Easy to play, easy to see even on a small screen. Careful, it's addictive like solitaire.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love Downton Abbey. Romance, intrigue, comedy and set in a stylish era wit perfect costuming and the oh so very English way of life! This show has it all. Perfection!!!
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|A must see for two reasons:<br />It's Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut,and it's a sweet, entertaining show.<br /><br />Quartet is a film of Ron Harwood's 1999 play set in a retirement home for musicians and singers.  The annual feconcert fundraiser is being planned to coincide with Verdi's birthday and heading the committee is Cedric Livingston, played by Michael Gambon.  Also on the committee is Cissy Robson, beautifully performed by Pauline Collins, who is \\"getting forgetful\\"  and her old stage buddy, Wilf Bond raucously played by Billy Connolly who delights in flirting with all the women and makes a hobby of needling Cedric.  Another resident, Reggie Paget, an outstanding performance by Tom Courtenay, who came to the home to check on his old buddy Wilf who had been admitted after a slight stroke.  Reg never left and found his niche in caring for his friends and holding classes for young people.  The scene in the classroom where he makes the comparison between rap and opera is delightful!<br /><br />Into the idealic setting comes the grouchy diva, a noted opera singer, Jean Horton, played by Maggie Smith.  Her arrival shakes up Reg who she was very briefly married to years ago, and turns his world upside down.  She also brings out the evil eye in an old rival, Anne Langley (Gwyneth Jones).<br /><br />I love Maggie Smith, a great actress, but couldn't get used to her childish behavior in this role, too much Downton I guess. The entire cast from the colorful main characters to the extras and minor bits are all exquisite.  Beautiful, touching performances by all. The music throughout the film, lovely range of familiar classics.  Great piano, violin, voices, in fact, my only complaint would be that I could have heard more from the very talented musicians and singers.  Be sure to see the credits.<br /><br />I hope this is not the last of Director Hoffman.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|I really liked watching this movie, as a matter of fact I watched it twice. Very thrilling and scarey. I watched it the second time because I liked it so well.
B002RI98BA|4.0|Very informative....gave me new insight into early American politics. being from Aotearoa I knew nothing about this piece of history.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Drew Evans is the perfect bombastic bad boy.  He's everything a girl WISHES she didn't want but truly does want every single moment of her life and then some. Read this book. He is perfection. Fabulous.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|works on my kindle fire. fun puzzle game. pretty easy but makes you think.<br />reminds me of a good fire maple mystery game like secret of grisley manor only easier on the brain.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This young lady has amazing skills. Not only does she play beautiful and flawless music, but she expresses herself with dance too! Simply amazing!
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|ever since the update the game barely works now and won't even load you have to delete the game and reinstall it fix it
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Well I chose to read this because I wanted to read it before the movie came out... I thought it was going to be OK, but it was Phenomenal!! If you are.  Hunger Games fan, you DEFINITELY love this book.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This is one of Baldacci's good ones!  The main character, Investigator Puller, is someone I'd like to see in another book.  Baldacci did this with Agent Robie in two books and they both were FANTASTIC!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are pretty much the standard for videography.  Monitoring audio is essential while shooting; no one wants to go over footage later and discover that the picture's great but the sound was ruined.  There is no pair of headphones that are &#34;the best&#34; for everything.  Different things require different cans, lnd these are great for making speech sound crisp.  If you're in the studio mixing an opera track, maybe a different pair is in order.  If you're just listening to your ipod, you can probably get a cheaper pair.<br /><br />The construction seems pretty durable and the whole things comes in a little bag so that they don't get too dirty (important for me since they're banging around with a bunch of other gear all the time.  The headphones fold up into the head strap to make them even more compact and there's an 1/8&#34; to 1/4&#34; adapter that screws in.<br /><br />All in all a great pair.
1781162646|4.0|I have always really liked Stephen King and have gotten many hours of pleasure from reading his books, however, why did he have to input his personal political views by saying something so hateful about Dick Cheney in Joyland! To quote Stephen King, &#34;Dick Cheney, that apologist for waterboarding and for too long chief preacher in the Holy Church of Whatever It Takes, got a brand new heart while I was writing this ---how about that? He lives on; other people have died.&#34; What kind of thing is that to say?
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This is a great game with beautiful graphics. I really enjoyed the puzzles and the mystery.  My only complaint is that the game wasn't long enough! There need to be more rooms.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Since I love Science Fiction The story is surrounded with mystery i would Recomend to Everyone, it has humer  and Action
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I'm reading this book after watching the series on TV.  The book provides more detail and helps me keep the names of the characters straight.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I thoroughly loved this season, which is packed full of twists and turns as Downton continues to learn its role in an ever-changing world. I can't say that I was pleased with all of the changes, but I am still a huge fan and look forward to the next season!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is so great because I mean like you can write a story here and we create so it's really funny and easy to use:)
B00011KHTM|2.0|We purchased these items to connect a second screen to iMac's in our offices.  Big mistake.  Since we would loose one-third of our purchase price in returns, we decided to just keep them on hand in case we have an older mac that they might work on.  They may work just fine, but we can't tell because the adapter is much larger than the port on the iMac! They just don't fit!
B005LAIIMG|2.0|We went and saw this this weekend. We waited quite a while for this to come out, and even though they redid the ending (last 40 mins) of the movie, did nothing to save this film. The effects were horrible. The zombies in action,you could not<br />see the true detail of the characters. Everything went way too fast, almost like speeding up the film as the zombies came running through the scenes. The Computer Graphics were sub par at best. The writing was terrible, it is sad to know that a seasoned actor such as Brad Pitt was an executive producer of this movie. The acting was ok, the film did not give the audience enough backstory, confusing the audience as to who main characters were and what their purpose was in the movie. I was not really impressed with the principal actors efforts. I am a zombie film fan, with this one was D O A<br /><br />CHRISTOPHER BERRY
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The only improvement I would suggest is make it longer! Best game out there...waiting and hoping for more!!!  My whole family loved this game!!! This is a winner!
B003F3FJQO|2.0|Okay, so I am two books into the series and the author has still not given any answers to the behavior of WICKED. Too many horrific deaths.  I am done.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game more than temple run but they definitely stole the idea. The new locations keep the game fresh and new.
B000FBJG04|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of World War II.  I was a very young person during that time, but remember some of the details and reports on the news.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book has fantastic action and drama that takes place both in the real and virtual universe. It's a brilliant mix of fantasy and sci-fi. Players must use their witts and weapons of magic & technology to battle enemies and solve puzzles in their quest for the ultimate prize. It's well written without a lot of typos and also has a satisfying ending. Loved it!
B005LAIIMG|4.0|Let me state upfront that I did not read the book, so I cannot make any comparison between the book and the movie. But I did see the first trailer for this many months ago (it's from the very beginning of the movie, where Brad Pitt and his movie family is stuck in the car in Phillie), and I was genuinely excited and very much looking forward to seeing this. Then all of the negativity started seeping from seemingly everywhere (multiple scene reshoots! budget overruns! nonsensical plot!). I mean, the movie critic at the Financial Times, whom I happen to respect quite a bit, rated this movie zero stars, ZERO! My son and I finally saw the movie this weekend in the theatre.<br /><br />\\"World War Z\\" (2013 release; 116 min.) starts off with Gerry Lane (played by Brad Pitt) and his family (wife and 2 young daughters) having breakfast while keeping an eye on the TV, broadcasting disturbing news about rabies-reminding symptoms breaking out everywhere. Next thing we know, the Lane family is stuck in a traffic jam in downtown Phillie, and all mayhem breaks loose. Those 10-15 min. in downtown Phillie are some of the most intense minutes I can recall seeing in a movie in a long, long time, and after that we are off to the races. To tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience and hence pointless.<br /><br />Several comments: the initial 80 min. of the movie (ending with the crash in Wales) are nothing short of flawless, indeed the most thrilling and intense movie viewing that I have experienced in a long time. The uncertainty, anxiety and utter chaos all feel very real. Forget that this is a \\"zombie\\" movie, as it is more about a movie where the human race is fighting for its very survival. The last 40 min. are not quite as stellar (and hence I can't rate this movie 5 stars), where the producers seemingly were struggling in how to bring it all home and wrap it up in a sensible and believable manner. At that, they succeed, but the visuals simply cannot compete with those of earlier action scenes in the movie. All that aside, I would strongly urge you to forget about all of the negative stuff you've been hearing or reading about this movie, as \\"World War Z\\" is shockingly good and makes for a very intense movie experience. Both my son and I simply loved it. We saw the movie in 3D and I didn't think it added much to the experience, so save those extra $3 or 4 bucks and see it in 2D. Meanwhile, \\"World War Z\\" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!e with those of earlier action scenes in the movie.

B000SEI230|5.0|As with any book, this is much better than the movie.  A timeless love story that will make you laugh, cry and everything inbetween.  One of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The story is great, there are a lot of details that make your imagination recreate the story in your mind.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Funny look at relationships the have a way of working out. Didn't think I would see that much of Mr. Timberlake.
B00C1S945G|4.0|A good season with some great story-lines and some really good episodes,  Pulaski was a nice break from the shrillness of Crusher.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|great game but after my first go into the game it crashed I thought it was ok but I could not get back into the game buy the real temple run I like the old one better this one is a piece of JUNK so and is you love wolves go read the wolves of the beyond boos they are EPIC and take Mg advice
B00ADS98FC|5.0|pitch perfect is the funniest movie i have ever seen if you have not seen it watch it youll love the movie.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|From almost the very beginning this movie had a lot of action. Great special effects. If you like action and scary movies then be sure to rent this one you won't be dissapointed!
B00338QENI|4.0|Very readable. Unlike most non-fiction, it didn't keep belaboring points and told a good story in an entertaining manner.<br /><br />Review would be shorter, but there is some minimum. Really?
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Though the plot was the standard slightly mediocre story line, the characters in this movie are so engaging ESPECIALLY Jack Reacher that I HAD to give it a full five stars. This was one of the best movies that I have seen in a while; one misses the hero that is NOT a hero. I am not speaking of the Dark Hero type such as Vin Diesel in The Chronicles of Riddick, I am speaking of a truly human individual with no super powers, no enhanced abilities... just a man.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a man that has seen way too much war, too much fighting and too much everything in the name of a freedom he had never truly experienced. Only to come home and find out that what we espouse as free is truly bondage in another area; so he is a drifter with a  mission of justice, leaving his old station as a military investigator behind but not his credo, values or personal stand against injustice as a whole.<br /><br />This type of character is the type that we need more from Hollywood. And despite what was said by comic books fans, as I am not familiar with the comic, Tom Cruise was perfectly cast for this part despite his height and other dimensions that apparently don't match the comic book descriptors.  I am buying this movie which is the best form of compliment that I can think of in this day of streaming video with ease and no commitment to purchase.<br /><br />If you didn't get to see the film because of what others have said (that judge it without even seeing it most likely) I urge you to give it a chance, let the story unfold and I guarantee that by the last 45 minutes of the movie you will be kicking yourself that you waited this long to give it a shot.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Good premise, but pretty short. Was hoping for a lot more to happen, like from a Buick 8. Hope Sai King builds on this short story.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I am a zombie movie fan and this one was pleasantly different in the sense that the zombs started to have feelings. It was a nice thought but it will never happen. That said it was a cute movie. Rent it for sure.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyable distraction. Fun app with some challenges in each level.  I would reccommend this app if you enjoy puzzle solving.
B0040YFR1Y|3.0|Predators is an homage to the original 1987 Predator. The whole project is a nod to the original film and utilizes many scenes to illustrate its lineage. The writers seemed to want to distance themselves from the very poorly done AVP movies and even Predator 2 to a certain extent.  The distancing from AVP was the very best thing the writers could possibly do for the film. However, the exclusion of the lineage of Predator 2 alienates the original film's direct sequel making it an orphan; this harms the overall continuity of the franchise, but this is what Hollywood likes to do today!<br /> I saw this movie in theaters during the summer and honestly it is just a fun and amusing movie. It does not compare in quality to the original 2 films, but the imagination of the story is what drives it. All the characters are over the top and cliché (Adrian Brody is certainly no Arnold Schwarzenegger.) Topher Grace is just plain silly. But the film is a departure from the AVP's which took the series down a very dark path of awfulness and brings back the hot jungle feel of the original movie.<br />Honestly, Predator 3 could have been many things, hypothetically, it could have been much better, but also judging from other movies it could have been much, much worse. It is just a good summer time action film, rent it and see how you'd rate it next to all its predecessors.
B0080R3PSE|5.0|I couldn't afford to take the course so I bought the book and it really was very helpful in teaching me relaxation and a new idea of birthing.  It's nice to know there is an option out there for a more pleasant birth than what is portrayed on the TV or what society makes it out to be. The CD is great too to listen to before your birth, it's calming and helps you center yourself.  I can't wait to try it out when the birth day comes!
B008476HBM|5.0|What a great read. This book by Ms. Austen is wonderfuly writen about the Edwardan Era of the British Empire. A must have for your Kindal Libiary.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Jack Reacher in New York city.  Reacher finds himself in trouble with the Police, FBI, DOD Investigators and terrorists from Afghanistan.  With his brains and brawn and minimal help from others, Reacher slays the Afganies and saves the day.  The story is interesting, the pace is constant and the ending is different.  This is a book you will want to keep reading until the end.<br /><br />Richard Ruppel
B011ECVPHE|2.0|Prometheus is Ridley Scott's attempt to create an original Alien prequel. Ridley Scott had been wanting to make this movie since the late 80's and early 90's according to the Making of Alien 3 feature. In one of his more recent interviews he said he wanted to distance himself from the later Alien films and the abominable Alien vs. Predator films that nearly killed the franchise. There are some very good elements within the film and the design and H.R Giger-esque accents put the viewer in a very Alien like environment. However, this film unfortunately follows the pattern of the 2004 AVP movie. A science team arrive at an Alien temple/spaceship and encounter the progenitors of human civilization and chaos ensues. Instead of it being Antarctica it is a distant planet, instead of encountering  Predators they Encounter the Engineers. It's basically AVP with a far better design and isn't nearly as corny. But ultimately this film is not great. It's entertaining, but leaves so much to be desired of the director that created the 1979 Alien.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed every moment playing this app!  This app is really fun and challenges your critical thinking skills well! I would love to see more rooms added
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was interesting, and kept me in suspense throughout! I would recommend this game to anyone. It definitely keep me busy!
B006M4F67A|3.0|Not the apps fault really I just lost interest in it an uninstalled. Others may like it more than me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Was not sure how to play at first but found it fun and engaging once I got the hang of it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|we love this game and play as a family together and against each other.  it really gets the brain going.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|Pi was a dark movie with an interesting number theory theme.  It's in black and white, which made it better.  It's probably a two and a half star movie, really.  Good pick for prime free unlimited streaming.
B00881PTRC|3.0|So its hang man, the animations are pretty cute, the dictionary is pretty big but a lot of the words do repeat quite a bit. With all the words in the world there is no reason for a word to repeat in the same game. I could understand every few games getting the same word but it does occur too often.
