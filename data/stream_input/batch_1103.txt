0385341679|4.0|I finished reading it today. I read other reviews on the book and agree with alot of them.  I did think it was tooo long.  I got tired of the blah, blah parts.  I had reread the other books in the series, and I didn't like them the second time.  I hated the first person.  I hated that you would be reading along and all of a sudden you were no longer reading Mac but Dani. It didn't add anything to the story but irritation.  The answers to the questions everyone wanted were there and many surprises but I didnt see where there were questions unanswered.  Barrons was what he was. He was the damned. We really don't need anymore than that.  Mac was an unlikable character.  I never warmed up to her.  I hesitate to critise her because it was hinted that she was bipolar. Which I wonder if Moning is bipolar or does she know someone who is.  It would explain alot of the rambling and the plot bouncing all around. I felt the plot was sometimes giving to much info that the love of the characters ond the story was lost.  I don't care much for Dani and don't care what happens to her.  Ryodan is ok but I would like to see him have to handle Kat.  She may tame him by her gentleness. I really would like to see more about Chrstian.  I think he will need Jo to help him find away around his predictment. To be honest I read the series for the chance to see how the Kelters were doing.  I hated that Moning reduced them to spating children.  I gave this reveiw a 4stars because of the author. I dearly hope the rest of the series is not in the first person. Because this one left me feeling glad it was over.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I automatically rate this release as 1-star because of the 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full screen).  Lucasfilms pulled the same nonsense when they released the special edition on video back in '97.  First they released the \\"special edition.\\" Then, a few months later, they released the special edition in Letterbox (original widescreen) format in 16:9.  I will not be buying what Lucasfilms is putting out on Blu-ray this September.    I'll be holding out for the Letterbox version, which is sure to come out shortly thereafter.  I want to see the whole movie, not the \\"full screen\\" version with 1/3 of the imagery cropped off from the sides.

B0016PM722|4.0|Santa brought me this sweet baby for Christmas.  My little boy received Vader's sword (he's Sith, you see.).  Of course, the family living room was ablaze with neon swordplay before any other gifts could get unwrapped.  However, during these epic battles (ironically of father and son), I couldn't help but notice that the sound effects associated with the saber's motion were much better on the red, Vader sword.  The Anakin sword had somewhat delayed sound effects.  Also, the swooping sound was not as pronounced as the Vader sword.  Not a big deal since the saber, kept over the fireplace, is used primarily for stalking the halls at night to obtain midnight sustenance, and the occasional juvenile discipline of a Jedi parent's Sith child gone astray.    Worth every penny Santa dropped on it in spite of the sound delay.
B000JMKRKC|1.0|I have only started reading this novel and am thus far enjoying it. I need to state though, how ridiculous it is that the Kindle version is $3 more than the paperback edition when the publisher expends little to no money in publishing the digital version.

0441013597|5.0|I was at first reluctant to read Dune.  I heard it was very complicated and dense, and although I like science fiction, I am more of a fan of the fantasy genre. Well, I got to say, I am glad that I followed my boyfriend's advice and finally read Dune!     People who claim Dune is dense and complicated are right, Herbert creates a very complex world. However, it's complexity is what makes Dune so enjoyable. This new and strange world becomes real to the reader because of all the clear detail that Herbert provides. The society is as complex as our own and the development of the characters is very rich and believable.     There is not much more that I can say that hasn't been said already. Just give the book a chance, it may surprise you.

I was very disappointed and sorry that I took the time to read the book.
B000AP04MO|4.0|Increasingly influenced by Italian neo-realism and French new wave, English and American motion picture styles changed a great deal during the 1960s--but for the most part the greater change was confined to small art films or movies aimed at the youth market.  But in 1967 three motion picture heavy weights took on the challenge: Stanley Donen, Albert Finney, Audrey Hepburn.  The film was named TWO FOR THE ROAD, and it followed the rise and fall of a marriage as the couple take repeated car trips across France--first as happy young lovers, ultimately as disillusioned and faithless husband and wife.  What made the film unexpected was that it jumbled the various trips, showing first a scene from one and then a scene from another, jumping and cross cutting across time and space in a way that makes D.W. Griffith's INTOLERANCE seem positively unsophistocated.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn had previously appeared in the 1964 PARIS WHEN IT SIZZLES, a flyweight comedy that juxtaposes fantasy and reality; it had been one of her few major failures, a box office bomb and a critical debacle, and from her point of view TWO FOR THE ROAD was too similar.  She repeatedly declined the project until writer-director Stanley Donen revised the script to her satisfaction, but even so she remained anxious about the project.  Even with Hepburn signed, Donen had tremendous difficulty finding a leading man.  Everyone wanted to work with Hepburn but no one, including Michael Cain and Paul Newman, wanted to do it on this particular film.  Ultimately, Albert Finney--a noted stage actor who was best known in film as the leading man in TOM JONES--took it on.<br /><br />Casting was not the only difficulty.  Excepting a few restaurant and hotel scenes, TWO FOR THE ROAD is a film shot outside and in one car after another.  At the time, car scenes were usually done by having the car towed or by putting the car in front of a rear projection screen.  In this film, however, the actors had to play the scenes while driving the car, and new techniques had to created.  In several scenes the actors themselves were required to call the takes and press various buttons that operated the cameras mounted to the car.  Since there was a tremendous amount of background noise involved in the shoot, a large percentage of the film had to be looped, a process in which the various actors re-record their dialogue.  And although most films are shot out of sequence, TWO FOR THE ROAD was already written out of sequence, a fact that made continunity an extreme challenge.  When all was said and done, no one expected much of such a hard-to-make film, so it was probably a shock to all concerned when it became the critical darling of its year.<br /><br />As previously noted, the film is a portrait of a marriage as it evolves over the course of a decade or so.  Mark (Finney) is an archetech; Joanna (Hepburn) is a member of a girl's choir.  Both are traveling through France, and when everyone in the choir except Joanna is struck down by chicken pox the two find themselves unwilling companions.  A decade or more later Mark is a success with little time or interest for his wife and daughter, Joanna despises the demands his success has made on both of them, and they drive through France wondering if divorce is the answer.  Between these two points there are other trips, most notably one with the obnoxiously American Manchester family, a one night stand for Mark, a more serious affair for Joanna, and a series of romantic interludes, violent arguments, and comic disasters.<br /><br />Although the critics adored it, some viewers simply found it confusing, and even today many find it difficult to follow--or to know how to react to the film.  Is it a comedy?  Certainly there is plenty to laugh about, particularly where the M.G. or the Manchester family is involved.  Is it a drama?  You don't get a lot more serious than the moment in which Joanna admits her affair to Mark.  But the real flaw in the film isthat what seemed fresh and new in 1967 has been done quite a few times since.  These days we're used to actors driving cars: at the time the innovation was exciting, but today we scarcely notice it.  The notion of cross cutting between time and various time loops was not exactly new in 1967, but it was still unexpected; today, of course, it is a commonplace.  And so TWO FOR THE ROAD has in many ways fallen victim to its own innovations: later films took the ideas, improved upon them, and now we've seen it all before.<br /><br />Even so, the expert performances of Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn make the film worth watching.  They have tremendous chemistry together; it is a pity they did not repeat the pairing.  The period costuming is fascinating--Hepburn becomes something of an evolving fashion plate as the film progresses, going from jeans to a silver-disk evening gown--and the overall production quality is outstanding.  The script is also remarkably witty and insightful.  What more could you possibly want?  As for bonus material, there is a commentary by director-writer Donnen, but it is rather disappointing and best left to hardcore fans of the film.  Over all, recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br />In Memory of Roscoe, Faithful Companion, 1999-2011in 1967 has been done quite a few times since.

B0024RID6U|2.0|I'll make this review quick.    Look, I'll write a review on 'Tattoo You' eventually on one of the earlier pressings. It's a stellar album, it really is. It's The Rolling Stones outtakes album, but these outtakes are so great, one has to wonder why they weren't included on the albums they were recorded for ('Waiting on a Friend,' for example, would fit perfectly on 1973's 'Goats Head Soup,' which it was recorded for).    So as you can see, the two-star review is not for the music. That's an EASY five stars. The two stars are for the botched remastering. The mix is distorted and compressed and the volume is turned *way* up. It's a mess. It's almost hard to listen to and stomach. I don't know what the Stones were thinking authorizing this, but it is a disaster. An absolute disaster.    Overall, if you see this in stores, MAKE SURE you are either buying the 1990 Columbia pressing or the 1994 Virgin remaster as opposed to the 2009 Universal (or Polydor) pressing. This is a great album, but avoid all of the 2009 remasters. I bought 'Still Life (American Concert 1981),' 'Dirty Work,' and this one to test and see what they sounded like. It did not sound good on either my iPod or my speakers, and all of them sounded just terrible.    If you have the 1990 Columbia pressings and/or the 1994 Virgin remasters, hold on to those. Both of them (yes, even the Columbia remasters from when CDs were first being released) sound miles better than this over-compressed, distorted nightmare of a remaster.    Great album. Make sure you buy it, but avoid this copy of it like the plague.
B0031RS44S|4.0|This is the 14th Jack Reacher book that I have read and it is still a very good series. Jack is still the superman and the villains are in for his terrible revenge. But after reading all these books it is starting to irritate me that how many laws Jack Reacher breaks nobody will ever find and prosecute him. In these books there is no CSI anywhere that would ask questions about dead people. Jack Reacher is the police, prosecutor, jury, judge and executor rolled into one. Also, all his colleagues are as cold-blooded as him. They kill people and go about their business as if it was a rainy day.<br />I would like to see Jack Reacher trying to fix a situation in the real world. Why not throw in some real people and some real cops? Let him get out of a situation that could happen to anyone. Also let him meet a real woman that gets under his skin!

0060853972|3.0|\\"Good Omens\\" is listed as a collaborative effort between Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett.  In style, however, it is all Pratchett, with all the little quirks that readers of the Discworld are familiar with.  There's a huge cast of characters, rapidly shifting viewpoints, an intrusive narrator, and even Death running aorund and speaking in capital letters.  However, despite having all the pieces there, it somehow fails to add up to something satisfactory.    The problem is not that there aren't enough jokes.  The problem, I think, is that there are too many jokes.  The authors desire to cram a joke into nearly every sentence.  As a result, the humor has quantity but not quality.  Here's a sample paragraph:    \\"To shadowy figures lurked in the ruined graveyard, one hunched and squat, the other lean and menacing, both of them Olympic-grade lurkers.  If Bruce Springsteen had ever recorded 'Born to Lurk', these two would have been on the album cover.  They had been lurking in the fog for an hour now, but they had been pacing themselves and could lurk for the rest of the night if necessary, with still enough sullen menace left for a final burst of lurking around dawn.\\"    The entire book is like that.  Every page is stuffed with lines that are almost funny, that might border on funny, but that aren't quite there.  Every paragraph has a turn of phrase that just isn't quite as clever as the authors think it is.  The book is not terrible, but at nearly 400 pages of not quite funny it does drag a bit.  On the plus side, the authors dedicated to the memory of G. K. Chesterton-how sweet.  Perhaps after finishing this one people will try [[ASIN:0755100204 The Poet and the Lunatics]].

B0034G4OVS|3.0|I rented this movie from Redbox. The movie is very slow at the beginning. You have to have patience sitting around the beginning. It's hard relating to college kids talking about redundant things over and over in this movie. But, right in the middle of this movie it's starts to get intense. I will not explain every detail of this movie. But, the reason why it is so intense. Is because, it seemed so real. The way the guy broke his legs and got eaten alive by wolves. While his girlfriend was their hearing every cry from her boyfriends mouth. That is what made this movie intense; along with how the actors interacted with one another when surving is reality. And they no longer were carefree college students anymore.
B0049VGSLG|5.0|This is a great album from start to finish and is just fun pure rock n roll. It has a good fifties rockabilly feel to it and JD McPherson either wrote or helped write ten of the twelve songs on here which is nice. He has great vocals and is also a very talented guitarist as well. I just saw these guys perform all week at The Surf Ballroom for the 2011 Winter Dance Party Tribute to Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and Big Bopper and this band was unbelievable live. Great songs and great energy.  It is always nice to get an album you can listen to from start to finish and not have to skip any of the songs. I liked all the songs, but the standout tracks in my opinion are \\"North Side Gal\\", \\"Fire Bug\\", \\"Wolf Teeth\\", \\"B.G.M.O.S.R.N.R.\\", and \\"Scandalous\\". I would highly recommend this if you like rockabilly or fifties rock and you should also check out his album he did when he was with The Starkweather Boys called \\"Archer St. Blues\\" released in 2007. Great cd also.

B003ZK58WM|2.0|after Pillars of the Earth, was expecting something a tad more 'riveting'.  First couple of chapters were in-depth with lots of interesting historical perspectives. After that it is basically a sophmoric Harlequin romance novel wrapped around a thin veneer of historical items dealing with outlandish tedious scenarios that treat the approach to the WWI, the Russian revolution, the War itself as  seen through the eyes of teen agers. Fall of the Giants?  No, that was when they relocated to San Francisco from NY.

B001GCUO5M|5.0|I've read a bunch if not all of the 1 star reviews and I've come to the conclusion that some people just shouldn't watch movies if they cannot pay attention. Or maybe they should watch something less concerting like an action movie where theres little to no dialogue and bad acting. These same people didn't get ( understand ) the movie fight club by stating. i don't get it. whats the big deal with the movie that deals with fight clubs? Again....... go watch an action flick because you surely cannot pay attention to the dialogue.     Shutter Islnad is just like that. You have to pay attention to the dialogue. If you have to stop to go to the bathroom or get some popcorn or ice cream then pause the movie because if you miss one line in this flick there's a big hole in the plot when you get back.     Use your brain. follow along. At the end you'll find out who Tyler Durden really is..... oopsie. thats fight Club talking. Use your brain... follow along closely and at the end it will still be up to you to decide who the main character really is. Its pretty evident who he is but I like the fact that the writer and the director leave you with the tiniest lingering doubt.     Excellent story, excellent movie...... excellent dialogue and excellent acting.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This move is not just an action film. It carries deeper thematic messages that are sure to make this movie a favorite among intellectuals as well as action fans or comic book fans. Christopher Nolan's directing is solid as ever, and his staccato directing style perfectly fits the chaos of the film's events. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker (the antagonist) will continue to stand out in the minds of movie reviewers as the best acting of the decade (and as a winner of the Best Supporting Actor academy award). I would recommend this movie to anyone except those who insist on a happy ending; although there is some resolution, the story will remain unfinished until 2012 when Batman rises again (The Dark Knight Rises). However, in true Christopher Nolan style, The Dark Knight Rises may not have resolution either.

B000683VI4|5.0|God's inspired word states that \\"if I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing\\" 1 Corinthians 13:2 (New International Version). The undeniable power of love is eloquently depicted in the film, The Notebook, directed by Nick Cassavetes and based on the best-selling novel of the same name written by acclaimed author, Nicholas Sparks. The filmmakers and casting directors unearthed a treasure when they chose Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, and Gena Rowlands to portray, through time, the main characters of Allie Hamilton and Noah Calhoun (New Line Productions, Inc., 2009). Each of these actors brings a fresh, interesting, and distinctive ambiance to their characters. The costumes are beautifully authentic, the cinematography is excellent, and most importantly, this tender love story has the ability to capture viewers' hearts and transport them to another time and place. The emotional power of this extraordinary film is that, if we stop long enough to ponder the thought, each of us has probably had the experience and inspiration of knowing a real-life Noah and Allie. Maybe your own romantic relationship is a testament of true love. This story resonates with anyone who has ever loved another passionately with all their heart and soul. It is a film for anyone who values a beautiful story that demonstrates the astonishing power of love.[[ASIN:B000SNQWXS The Notebook]][[ASIN:B00023B1E4 The Notebook]]
B003YD00RS|5.0|The airline industry uses checklists religiously but they are the exception and not the norm.  The investment, legal, and medical fields are all areas that could implement checklists to improve outcomes but investment managers, lawyers, and doctors for whatever reason (hubris?) have yet to embrace them.     Atul Gawande spearheaded a study to use checklists before surgical procedures and outcomes improved dramatically.  One reason for the dramatic result is the decentralization of power.  For example, while nurses may previously have been afraid to question a surgeon they are now required to speak up to confirm the implementation of proper procedure.  This book is not only a flat out fun read but also contains a wise if under-appreciated idea: Checklist can improve outcomes.
B00000DGUG|2.0|My track-reincarnation has a three tiered process.     Its goal is to keep, to any possible extent, as many of the buyers of J.L.P. as possible.

030746363X|1.0|Catering to child like naivite and wishful thinking.   Ferris excels at marketing himself and other products. A more honest book would have him sharing his marketing approach, a quasi elitist thinking that does not have too much genuine respect for thorough research or, for that matter, people.  Ferris knows that he couldn't write &#34;the magic wand&#34; so he chose the 4 hour title, in essence a continuation of the 1 minute manager, the 10 minute this or that or 7 steps to insane riches and 5 minutes to nirvana.  The author is hopefully too intelligent to not know that 4 hour work weeks don't work for the huge majority of people and that even work in India and his outsourcing recipes are far from easy. In which case he's a fraud. Or he isn't, in which case he's dumb. A friend of mine just developed a social networking site, he also read the 4 hour work week and found the process of working with the hired guns in India a hair graying experience - twice - and certainly not manageable with 4 hours per week.  It's a fairy tale, and a really bad one. Ferris also has some difficulty hiding his cynicism and contempt for high quality work when proposing collecting money from other people working. The 4 hour body is, as a follow up, a pretty chaotic collection of more or less unrelated ideas or things he heard from other people.  Just as a 4 hour work week is for people who really don't know the meaning of the word &#34;calling&#34;, &#34;career&#34;, &#34;passion&#34; or &#34;mission&#34;, meaningful work that you enjoy, the 4 hour body is just as nonsensical for large parts of the book as the 4 hour work week is.  True change comes from principles, not fads, from honesty, not greed. Ferris' advice about not eating fruits is borderline idiotic because you are missing a lot of benefits and nutrients if all you eat are vegetables. If you eat lots of veggies, you can eat fruits. What's much more important is where they come from and whether they are mostly raw or mostly processed. The binge day is a perfect example that Ferris hasn't really understood anything on a profound level as anyone who has tried that will tell you - you will gain your lost weight back pronto. The binge day is the day where the body restores all the weight you lost, fat cells are acting like a sponge unless you reduce them over several months, waiting for an opportunity to gain their original size. The Barry Sears diet a previous reviewer mentioned is a disaster with its damage to the body. The sex advice has been around for ages, let's not comment on Nina Hartley, I'm sure Ferris is negotiating some lucrative deals with the people he features, no surprise as his main interest seems to practice the 4 hour work week himself. Working a little longer might actually accomplish something profound and lasting, this book appears like another fad, way too incomplete to live up to its claim. Having participated in the immersion swimming, it's clear that it won't turn you into a world class swimmer. Is it a waste of time? No. Are there other equally or better swim trainers? Of course.  If you like reading a collection of quick fix recipes, the sort you could be reading in various magazines at your hair dresser and if you don't have the time, energy or intellectual drive to explore and question yourself, this book will be mildly entertaining, except in all the areas where it wont. If you are looking for a more profound way of improving your life, I suggest to study one subject diligently until you have a more complete understanding.  Ferris knows that these are the times of ADD and people like to be told what to do. This is dangerous as it can lead to dictatorial regimes and fascism as it is defined in the dictionary, with corporations and the politicians who work for them telling the rest what to think and what to believe. With the last health care law encompassing around 2500 pages the power of systemic overwhelm was self evident - and who benefits from this mess and confusion.  We need clarity and this book will more likely add to the ongoing confusion - for the main benefit of the author's account. There's the main problem with this book, that Ferris in a calculated way assumes this role of a guru despite a rather impressive lack of credentials. It's like writing a book about cars and claiming that the key makes the thing go. Well it doesn't.t to do.

0385737955|5.0|Books like The Maze Runner are the reason why I read. I was so engaged in this novel that I was up into the late hours of the night reading it, hiding from the cold under the covers with my book light, while my boyfriend slept next to me. He read the book before I did and immediately bought the second book; so I knew this book was going to be a good one already because he is extremely picky when it comes to books and it is hard for a book to hold his attention. I finally put the book down for the night only to pick it up again the next day and spend hours in the bath tub with it until my toes looked like prunes and the water grew tepid but I just could NOT put this down until I'd finished it.<br /><br />There were some truly horrific parts throughout the whole book and everything is shrouded in mystery; which I absolutely love! It reminds me a bit of one of my favorite shows, LOST, though I can't say why exactly without ruining it for you. If you were a fan of LOST while it was on the air chances are you will be a fan of this book.<br /><br />The language used by the Gladers was easy to get used to and actually enjoyable. The characters were well written and often provide the comic relief needed to keep this novel from being too dark. Thomas makes a wonderful narrator; easy to relate to from the moment we meet him and his terror in the box on page one, to the very last page when he has developed into something of a leader. I can't say much more without ruining it all (not that I have many answers myself as this is a series) but I highly recommend this one to anyone looking for a page turner to lose themselves in.
B0042KZJ46|3.0|This is more or less an okay recording of an okay show. Definitely not his best concert by any stretch. The sound is quite good except for the final two tracks, which are overpowered by booming bass. \\"[[ASIN:B00005MK9Y Babylon By Bus]]\\" is a much better live CD, and Marley's concert \\"[[ASIN:B00009V7T0 Live at the Roxy]]\\" is a better recording.

0307454541|4.0|Despite the violence, I thought the characters, plot and pace of this story were excellent.  Larsson does a great job casually mentioning clues and tying them in many pages later.  There are a lot of Vanger family members to keep track of, but a handy family tree at the beginning of the book is very helpful.<br /><br />Larsson leaves a few details up in the air, I assume to bring back in the next of the series.  These details leave no question that I will start The Girl Who Played with Fire as soon as possible.
0060936223|5.0|Reading this book was like listening to a wonderful song. It is so lyrical, and well done, it felt like poetry.<br /><br />\\"Just Kids\\" is the story of two artists, Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe. Patti met Robert when they were both young, and broke on the streets of New York City and formed an unbreakable bond. From tiny apartments to the Chelsea Hotel, and on to fame, they stayed together through thick and thin. Lovers came and went, jobs, apartments and struggles followed them, but they pursued their art, each in their own way, but always together, keeping a vow they made when they were just kids.<br /><br />The combination of art, music and poetry is irresistible. And oh the people they knew. It is just amazing to read the stories of people we have known about for years.<br /><br />I loved this book, and found myself stalling as I neared the end, wanting it to go on and on. Patti Smith made me want to go back to being young and to join them in the joy and amazing times they shared. This book won the National Book Award, and it was well deserved. Bravo!!<br /><br />I purchased this book from The Tattered Cover, my favorite bookstore.
B003K16NO8|1.0|I am fed up with Kindle versions of books costing almost as much as the physical book and yet being significantly less valuable. In this case the book includes a DVD of examples. The Amazon book summary says:     1) DVD-ROM includes lesson and media files for over 20 hours of training   2) Focused lessons take you step-by-step through professional, real-world projects   3) Accessible writing style puts an expert instructor at your side   4) Ample illustrations and keyboard shortcuts help you master techniques fast   5) Lesson goals and time estimates help you plan your time   6) Chapter review questions summarize what you've learned and prepare you for the Apple Certified Pro Exam.    So clearly the DVD content is integral to the value of this book. However in the Kindle version it talks about \\"inserting the DVD that came with this book\\" ect - I had assumed that the publishers would put the digital content online somewhere so that we could download it and do the lessons, but there is nothing like that.    So - physical book (with DVD) = $34.64 (Paperback)  Kindle Edition (no DVD) = $31.18    How can this be value for money? And how can the Kindle edition be sold as 'equivalent' when clearly it is not?
1878424319|5.0|If you feel that something is missing in your life or that something is preventing you from arriving to where you want to be in life, this book is definitely a great start. Use it as a stepping stone to begin the journey of life (the way it was intended) and of good living.<br /><br />Other books recommended: A New Earth by Eckart Tolle, Positive Thinking by Norman VIncent Peale, and KJV Bible - can't go wrong there. Good luck.
1401322425|5.0|'Jamie At Home' has a great collection of recipes from the television series and is presented in an attractive and accessible way. The book is divided into the four seasons and focuses on different ingredients, from asparagus to eggs. It has growing tips for your own vegetable patch and manages to combine garden advice and cookery advice with equal skill, whilst being enjoyable to read. One thing I liked was the more natural descriptions for the recipes, instead of prescribing an exact amount of oil (for example 20ml) he just says 'two big glugs', this is reminiscent of the TV series, as well as making each recipe individual to the person cooking it. After all, that is what cooking is about, providing great food in a personal way. This book goes a long way to helping you achieve that and is a great place to find some tasty and inspiring recipes. Well worth a buy if you're a fan of the series or not.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0800141660|5.0|This has to be the best video version of the Jane Austen classic.  Emma Tompkins' hand was in all aspects of the production, especially the screenplay, which she wrote herself.  It shows. Excellent characterizations, casting, with extremely high production values worthy and reminiscent of the BBC PBS Masterpiece Theatre production.  One can almost visualize Alistair Cooke in an English library setting, seated in a leather wing chair with book in hand, ready to introduce the movie.  At any rate, only one word: superb.  Added bonus of Hugh (pre-House) Laurie as the hysterically funny Mr. Palmer, with pained and bored expressions and small utterances under his breath as his nitwit wife jabbers away. Priceless.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I bought this and the first season to fill in the blanks of the episodes I had missed. I didn't start watching the show until partway through the second season and had many questions about why things were as they were. It was too good of a series to not know! I've never ever bought a tv show dvd before, but this has turned out to be my favorite show and I had to get the full tale. It's quite worth it!
0765350386|5.0|I was very intrigued by the cover of the book, was not sure what to expect. I was browsing for hours for a good book to read I had read some disappointing ones lately; I love magic stories and an old world feel in fantasy (LotR).      I was not expecting the Mistborn trilogy to wow me as it did. I am not going to write in here about the plot for that you can buy the book.    OK so why did i like about the book: This book delivers on some important facet of life, while keeping it true to the genre of magical fantasy. The characters are very believable. I will say I had very good laughs, good cries, and at times my husband got mad because I could not put the book down º.     I felt very close to the protagonist(s) in this aspect.¡§self doubt¡¨ and the strength to find courage to rise above the uncertainty stands at the top of my list.  To have courage, trust, and faith in the simplest things that is given to us in this life and to have the conviction and strength to see the path through the end.     Opinion: This book is so mind-blowing, for anyone to read, you won't regret it. There is a complex magic system in the book, one, that I was not expecting.   [...]
B000R8YC18|4.0|'Taxi Driver' is a dark film looking at one mans alienation from society and life around him. It looks at how he gradually descends into his own form of madness and you really get a sense for how he feels through De Niros chilling portrayal. The lack of sleep and night shifts Travis (the main protagonist) works only serve to isolate him further from reality and life. When he meets a young political campaigner and a prostitute, both of these relationships spur him into dark action against the scum of new york. I have to say the direction and acting was excellent, you really get a feel for the malevolence Travis feels around him and his sense of disjointed exhaustion. The soundtrack is very dated now and the same jazzy refrain used throughout the film started to get on my nerves. It is a good film and definitely one to watch, but I have to say I was expecting so much more after all the hype on these pages and from things i've heard before that I was left a touch disappointed. The ending is powerful and then kind of fizzles out afterwards, you'll know what I mean when you watch it. Overall a good film and worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1932100660|5.0|I read this book, in large part, based on the reviews of other people.  I'm so grateful to all of you who wrote before me and so thankful I bought this book and read it. It is truly a message that must be heard by every American. Don't be scared of the title \\"The China Study.\\" It is informative but not the least bit dry or difficult to read. I found it fascinating, so much so that I read it like a textbook so that I would retain more on my first reading.  You can be sure, I'll read it again.    Why do we not hear about the value of eating a plant-based diet from our physicians? Because they don't believe it? Because they, themselves, are uninformed? Because they, like we, believe the marketing and \\"research\\" supporting the status quo? Because they don't believe that, even if we knew, we'd do anything different? Yes, to all of these. The shame is that thousands die every week from diseases that could be prevented or even reversed.     For all our technology and for all we spend on health care, we, as Americans, have terrible health. What if we all ate a plant-based diet? Can you imagine what we'd save in health care dollars, to say nothing of the suffering we needlessly put ourselves through?  It does require change which is always difficult at first, but Colin and Thomas Campbell provide such a convincing argument for making this necessary change.     The word must get out.  If you have cancer, diabetes, heart disease, weight problems, immunity problems (and the list goes on), don't pop a pill or supplement. Read this. If you want to avoid health problems in the future, read this. If you want to reverse your disease or improve your health, read this. This should be required reading of every high school student in the country.  Science teachers, are you listening?
1599218011|5.0|What I did learn is that the Crazy Sexy Diet (now a New York Times bestseller) is not just about the food, it's an attitude. It involves daily movement, colon health, meditation, and emotional healing. It's not about more chocolate, it's about green juice and lots of it.    I love Kris's approach to diet. She came to veganism from a health perspective, and very much advocates that it's the healthiest diet, but does not hold back from educating the reader about the ethical side of the diet.    Who should read this book:        * anyone who wants to make deep changes in their body, mind, and spirit        * vegans looking for a healthier approach to their diet with advice folks who are ethically on the same wavelength        * gluten-free folks who are feeling a little draggy        * raw newbies who want a gentle way to transition to the raw diet (the book does not preach all raw, and gives great ways to balance cooked and raw)        * anyone who wants to know more about detoxing and alkalizing!
B004132HZS|5.0|This new version of an old classic is beautifully and wonderfully done.  The choice of actors is perfect, they do an outstanding job as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  I can't wait for the next seasons to come out on DVD.

B00158K0S8|5.0|The movie itself is an Oscar winning classic and there's plenty of reviews about it if you've never seen it.<br /><br />I'm just going to post about this excellent reproduction of the film to blu-ray for those who've seen the movie and thinking of getting the hi-def version. You are awed right away with the opening scene with close ups of Patton's uniform, medals and gun  in striking detail. You'd never know this film was made in 1970. Granted I haven't seen a lot of old movies reproduced in blu-ray but I can't imagine it getting any better in visual clarity. I do know some old movies for some reason don't look much or any better in blu-ray then they do on DVD. I don't know if it's because there's no quality original film print available or what but if it's just the reproduction technique then every film should use the same.
B003NHRIVQ|1.0|I read this book which was AMAZING. I then watched the movie, expecting it to be a little worse but not so much. But no, it was HORRIBLE. The acting was completely wrong and the plot was significantly different (in a worse way). I feel as if the book is much more touching and actually made me cry. During the movie, I just wanted to slap whoever directed it. Honestly, I did not like this movie one bit. I don't understand why it has 4 stars.<br /><br />If you liked this movie, read the book. I bet you will change your mind.
0060531053|5.0|If you are getting started in brewing, reading the first two sections of this book are a must.

B002ZG980U|1.0|I have to say I was excited to see this movie hearing from so many how good it was. It was terrible. Way too long. It was very drawn out and kind of silly if you ask me. A dream within a dream within a dream. Levels? What is this, a video game? I did not think Ellen Page was suited for that type of role. There were too many elements to it. Too many scenes, drawn out scenes. And is it just me or did the van take way too long to hit the water? Bad movie.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|As the advertisement asks, \\"A you (firt name) Salt? Yes. Then you are a russian spy.\\" There is a person saying that Jolie is working for another country, Jolie saying she has to make sure her loved ones are safe, and the world seeing chasing after her. As the plots begin to spin, you begin to wonder if anyone is who they say they are and who, exactly, Salt is. she is ruthless, that's for sure, and she knows her stuff. Still, she is an agent with a past and that past is something that mingles with some high profile people.<br /><br />Salt is one of those movies that hits the ground running and waits for you to catch up. For an adrenile movie it has something of a complex plot (meaning it is complex on a Hollywood standard but a C- when looked out outisde of action), and i think this helps it. In the beginning you actually see how hard things are for an agent, see how complex it is when you work as a supposed spy, and then have that bubble deflated for you. you also have love added into the equation, making things interesting.<br /><br />When you look at this movie, a lot of it does revolve around the notion of love. From the start this is explain and given as part of the character, and from that start you gage what is transpiring. I have to hand it to jolie on this job because she seems to hold her own on all fields and she does it with style and a bit of mystery to her. Considering her real life and the microscope she operates under, you can see just how well this is portrayed there.<br /><br />The action here is fast, is solid, and the ideas are good. The movie is a run, Lola, run movie with a lot of firepower, and there are positions of the plot map that make you say \\"cool.\\" I like the way some things happen and the way Salt stays ahead, but the movie doesn't make her chasing people's total fools. They are not far behind and she seems ready, but a plot portion of the movie and the past explains this. And, again, you cannot for the love piece.<br /><br />As much as this is the same movie in some ways, it differs in some good ways as well. The way jolie gets to do things, interesting things, to get out is interesting to me as well. I liked the fact that we do not see bullets into a wall as some means to get out or shooting hundreds of people. We are also not given watered down ideas but have enough of a plot to work on today's terror system. Combine that with the man in her life and I took interest, sadness, love, revenge, and so much more out of moments here. It was a nice 5, provided you know what you are into here.<br /><br />Thank you.ways, it differs in some good ways as well.

0439023513|5.0|On it's face Mockingjay is exciting and hard to put down. Dig deeper and there's a whole debate of the brutalities of the human race. Characters are fully rounded out and we miss them when they're gone. The love story, which I always saw as only half of the book (the other half being this fascinating and somewhat familiar society), takes a back seat to a brutal war in which our heroine plays her expected role.     However, I've been reading many of these reviews and a lot of readers are upset over the way Katniss acted throughout Mockingjay. They say she took a backseat and wasn't proactive thus being untrue to the character set up in the first two books. I think she was exactly true to character.     In the first book she never wanted to be a public figure, she shied away from her costumes and interviews; letting others do most of the work. What she is is a natural survivor with a compassionate heart, when played out on TV won people over (not to mention Peeta's interviews and likability).      **SPOILERS**    So why then do readers expect her to remain \\"famous\\" after the wars ends? Wouldn't it make sense that she go back to her reclusive lifestyle before the first reaping? I never expected her to take an active role in the new government, or remain a public figure. I think the book ended perfectly true to each and every character from Effie, to Peeta, to Gale and especially Katniss. It's a bittersweet ending, but its probably what would happen.
0394800389|5.0|I purchased this book to make learning sounds fun for my daughter.  She has been receiving special services for speech articulation issues for 2 years and is 5 years old now.  The game that Mr. Fox makes at Knox expense is hysterical to her.  The fact that Mr. Knox puts Mr. Fox in his place at the end shows her what she can achieve even after many frustrations.  She practices reading the story out loud over and over.  This started right after I read the book to her the first time without me telling her to :)
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|Ever want to see how thngs begin? Well, be careful that this does not make you a participant in the game. The company that controls the Cube is a tightlipped operation, feeding the thing and keeping it going and recording all the stuff. Two men wathc it, too, and two men are asked simply to observe. This seems fine at first but it soon becomes an issue, and the issue is - simply - feeling pangs of remorse. This leads power some odd roads, shows off the Cube in odd ways, and segways into the new movie. It also says something on the game, the gamers, and some of what is transpiring.<br /><br />As far as The Cube franchise goes, I really liked it. i liked Cube and I thought Hypercube worked, and this prequel is also a nice entry onto the Cube stage. It has some nice ideas and some nice acting and a scale that makes the first movie seem like it is advancing. Place all the movies into that order and, boom, you have an evolving idea.<br /><br />along with this, you also have a rating that might be odd. As a movie itself the movie would score lower than a chain movie, with Cube and its sequels not exactly rating the same as Cube versus another title. It would be like comparing Friday the 13th movies. you do those andrank them so why not these?<br /><br />In this, you have some stuff that is explain but not too much to overwhelm. You also find out about Mr. Prime Numbers in this one, seeing how he got into the first movie as a subject. Also seen are some shades of the way the outside was seen to work, the way the world is, and the secret here. Basically, the Cube eats its young, taking down everything in its path. We knew that before and this says that we do it now. you simply don't ask and you don't get told the answer you dread.<br /><br />It has a rustic look but not a bad one and the traps are back. The Hypercube hurt a little of that with the way it was set, but the new movie makes up for that with older types of torment. also here are the staples that were in the first movie, with teams of people working through. As a Cube movie I would round to 5. As a movie, round to 4.<br /><br />Its all what you want. you haven't seen the Cube, do not see this. It will ruin some stuff. See them and see if you like them, providing you give this a chance and realize the budget. I liked it but I like movies like this but I can still say that it isn't bad. Sequels already suffer - it could have had some bad turns that it didn't take and the good stuff makes up for everything else.<br />3.6 - 4.

B000002VSN|5.0|The whole cd from beginning to end is a joy and reward to listen too. It brings heartfelt joy and happy tears everytime i listen because of the passion in the voices and heartfelt truth. Whitney and the whole cast of singers are such a delight and everytime i hear the cd, its puts me in mind of the movie and Denzel playing the angel. The cd and movie goes hand in hand and i would highly recommend both to whomever havent experienced either one.
0439023521|5.0|I'm a huge fan of post apocalyptic stories. This one however is so creative, it doesn't only show us a gray bleak world but also depicts the brightly colored consumerist society of the Capitol. The Hunger Games is like a meshing of the Running Man, The Long Walk, American Idol, Brazil, and Lord of the Flies.     Our heroine, Katniss, is an unlikely hero with few friends, an estranged mother, and a love of illegal hunting who is thrust into the spotlight for a cruel reality show; where there's only one survivor.     My favorite parts of this book are descriptions of the Capitol and it's people, so reminiscent of how we live today, and much like the movie Brazil (especially the costumes, wigs, and surgery!)     It really transcends the Young Adult category, and I highly recommend it for adults.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Let me start by saying I'm an old school rocker from the 70's who wants to expand my musical tastes.  I listened to the whole album all the way through and didn't get it.  Put it aside for a week and listened again to the first three songs.  Still no connection.  Listened  again the next day to the first three songs and....wow.  It's kinda like you have learn their style first and then it clicks.  Subterranean Homesick Alien is a work of art.  The spacey guitar and keyboard are quite remarkable. Just can't get enough of the album now.  By the way, it is best on vinyl.
1416987339|5.0|My daughter is 13 months old and Karen Katz is one of her favorites. I first found this book at our local library and soon knew she had to have her own copy. The vibrant colors and the short phrases are good for this age. She has even started to anticipate what is next as we read, saying, \\"bubbles and There He is!\\". My only complaint- she loves it so much we read it about 5X's.day!

0439023491|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the series; with the love story and the consumerist crazed capitol oppressing the poor districts. It's a perfect plot. I love the heroine Katniss, with her survivalist ways and anti social attitude.<br /><br />This book puts us right back in  District 12, after the Hunger Games, as Katniss and Peeta and Gale try to sort out their \\"issues\\" while the districts become slowly restless as the Capitol brutally retains its power.<br /><br />The middle book in a trilogy is usually filler, it sets up a new issue for the characters to overcome and they usually do, growing along the way and hurdling us to the finale with a huge cliffhanger. Catching Fire is no different. It's riveting and intense, and a lot like the first book. Out of the three books I find it to be the weakest, but still a great read.<br /><br />The plot is essential to the overall story (which I can't say for some series' ahem New Moon and Kushiel's Chosen) , and much of it comes into play in the finale. It also introduces some new and lovable characters.
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|First off, I got this at a steal of a deal from Amazon when the Black Friday sale was on. I purchased this for $9.99! That was the first great thing about this purchase.<br />Secondly, to see a film with the active participation of Robert Rodriguez is always a plus, no matter what!<br />Thirdly, to make a sequel without the mega-star who launched the franchise was a calculated risk, but truly worth it.<br />Anyway, the film starts, as everyone knows by now, with a freefall by Royce(Adrien Brody) to the planets' ground. He meets up with seven other \\"specialists\\", I use that word very loosely because two of them are killers! They begin to explore & have their fair share of run-ins with the planets' lifeforms! & their hosts or, in this case, their hunters! One by one they get picked off, they meet up with a survivor named Nolan played by Laurence Fishburne, who apparently has killed a few of these hunters in the ten seasons of being marooned on this planet! He has become psychotic & tries to kill the band of survivors & fails miserably in the process!<br />As with any \\"Predator\\" movie, survival is key & only the strong & resilient survive!<br />Just a bit of trivia or moments of paying homage are present in this sequel though, there is a man with a mini-gun, an obvious nod to Jesse Venturas' portrayal of Blaine from Predator, a man with a sword, in this case, makes his last stand, wins & dies opposed to Billy in Predator who lost altogether, the female lead survives, a trend for all of those lovely ladies in all the movies. The first movie has been referenced just like in the sequel, the Predator still amazes me as to how cleanly it can rip a skull & spinal column out of a body in tact!It's the third time that I'm seeing that & it still is frightening! & finally, I do not recall if anyone in this movie said, \\"You're one ugly ......!\\" I must have missed it or it was never used at all! Oh yes, one more bit \\"Kill me I'm here!\\" of course, a nod to Arnold's character from the original Predator.<br />Those of you who have enjoyed the previous two movies should get this one & add it to your library. It is a pity that the Alien vs Predator franchise was not up to par with this franchise! Great special features, highly recommended..

B000FC2PKG|2.0|I really have a hard time believing this is one of the bestsellers on Kindle store. Reading this book is like watching a clich&eacute;, everyday movie.<br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there's a strong sense of visualization here. More like a \\"been there, done that\\" kind of feel. You have watched and read so many movies/books like this; believe me, you don't need another one. Actually, you're being bombarded with stuff like this pretty much all the time, mostly even when you don't want to.<br />I should admit, the $0.99 price tag fooled me. I thought I can't go wrong with that price. I was bitterly wrong. It's the worst $0.99 I've ever spent. Period.
B002E9VT00|5.0|Back during high school, I had a choice of several books to read for an AP Language class, and I ended up deciding to read Hiroshima simply because it was the least expensive.  All I can say is THANK GOD!  Hiroshima was one of those books that made me put away everything else around me and just sit down in my backyard and read until it was too dark to see any words.  Hersey really puts you into the hearts and minds of those affected by the bombs in Japan, and the individual stories of heartbreak, triumph, and endurance were enough to make this cold-as-stone girl cry.  Everyone should read this, if not just because it's marvellously written, but because it speaks a lot about human nature and how we adapt to the worst of catastrophes.  How we live and die.  How we can see each detail and not know what to make of it.<br /><br />Beautiful and entrancing stories.  If you speak or read the English language, you NEED to read this.
B002NPUCP8|2.0|Although I like some of the songs on this album, I agree with the earlier reviewer who stated that Violet Journey is a more mature sounding effort. Orianthi is a great artist, but I don't like the overly commercial approach taken with this album, and was likely pushed toward by her producer.    Songs like Untogether, Drive Away, Believe, and Highly Strung are great, and all are on the original version of Believe. The first two of those songs really highlight her wonderful country-ish sounding singing voice. Unfortunately, those songs were replaced on Believe (II) with songs like Shut Up and Kiss me and Addicted to Love, which both sound a bit adolescent. Orianthi is an artist with incredible talent and potential, but it really seems like she moved in the wrong direction with this album.
B002VLZ092|2.0|I made the assumption that this would be the Hilda Rosner translated version because of the book cover shown (blue book with Buddha statue). It is NOT that translation. It was not easy to figure out which translation this is. I never did find the information on the amazon website.<br /><br />I found it ON THE KINDLE here: Menu --> Book Description --> Book extras--> Authors and Contributors --> It lists all of these translators: Sherab Chodzin, Susan Bernofsky, Joachim Neugroschel, Amir Fereydoon Gorgani.<br /><br />Amazon website does not recognize all of these authors. The closest print copy I could find is here:<br />[[ASIN:B001TKSRT6 Siddhartha [SIDDHARTHA] [Mass Market Paperback]]]<br /><br />Because there is no preview of this edition, I am still unsure if it is the same as the Kindle edition.<br /><br />As a teacher who was trying to purchase both print and Kindle options for students (of the same translation!), it is frustrating to have purchased 22 print copies of a translation for which there is no Kindle edition.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This is an asome book.It makes you belive all of this real happened. I could not put the book doun! This book realy desives all 5 stars.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|You know, you don't see many...or should I say, hear many unique, talented WOMEN artists anymore, they're all little girls, sluts, or women who like to show their body off. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like Lady Gaga as much as the next girl, but I can only handle so much pop stuff.  I've never really been a big bubble gum pop fan.  I'm 22 years old and I've been listening to Sarah McLachlan since i was 6.  So naturally, I have a different taste in music than the normal mainstream people.      Florence is a beautiful person, and her songs are so unique, I absolutely love her.    You can blare out hurricane drunk in your car when you see your ex with a new girl, or you can feel the chills down your back when you sing along and hear her beautiful voice on cosmic love.  My 13 year old sister loves Florence + the Machine.    The CD is awesome, and I can't wait until they come out with a new one!!
B002G1WE2S|4.0|Beautiful, catchy, poppy British pop rock.    Just good stuff.    Give it a listen. It is a shame this album wasn't a bigger hit.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|compre este video desde peru, y llego un dia antes de lo que prometieron, muy bien enpacado. Lo reomiendo, estoy satisfecho.
B003102JDM|4.0|A lot of words have been spilled out these review pages about the supposed esoteric nature of this film. Yes the protagonist is Jewish, and yes one does need to have an appreciation for droll humor, but if these are not obstacles to your viewing enjoyment, this is a straightforward, funny movie. The vast majority of viewers will easily relate to the problems that life brings into the protagonist's way. The ending does require an appreciation for the Jewish aversion to wrapping up something as complex as the human dilemma into a nice little package. The Christian worldview is intrincically more optimistic than that arising from diaspora Jewry. This last is no reason to not find humor, or interest, in the Jewish view of life; a view which does have some merit. (Author of this review is Gentile).
B001FW58D6|5.0|I just got into Fringe.  I was a fan of the first two seasons of Lost and then they Lost me. I am also a Supernatural fan.  This series is more like the later it continues, unlike Lost, to really focus on character and good stories.  I think John Noble is great.  I thought that getting them in the On Demand format would be good, but it's not.  By buying it in this format you miss the extra things that come on the DVD's.  Also the files are large and if you download a whole season it takes up a lot of space.  I've had to delete the episodes after I watch in order to have room to download new ones.  That's a bummer since I paid big bucks and would've like to keep all of the episodes.  So I just shucked out some more money to purchase the DVD's so that I could watch them over again.  Lesson learned.
0312600844|3.0|I had high hopes for this book since I had heard so much about it, but was disppointed in that I think it was brilliant in spots and \\"sloggy\\" in other spots.  I usually only skim spots in \\"techno\\" books, but found myself doing that in this book.
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|The dvd came on time, in brand new condtion. I really enjoyed this movie, great cast. Emma Stone in particular. she was in every scene, so it was a very  tiring film for her be in. I recommend this film very highly. ENJOY!!!!!
B003OY91HW|3.0|After reading negative reviews of this book, I compared the table of contents from both The Magnolia Bakery and More from Magnolia Bakery Cookbooks to this book's table of contents and found every single recipe from both cookbooks are indeed included in this one book. While I completely agree with reviewers who felt this is a rip-off if you own both previous books (which I do and I almost bought this one), it should be noted that the title of this book is The COMPLETE Magnolia Bakery Cookbook. The front flap description does state this book is a comprehensive collection of recipes from the bakery in honor of the bakery's 10th anniversary, however, no where does it state that this book is simply a combination of every recipe from both previous cookbooks. In my opinion, omitting this key piece of information is being intentionally misleading, a tad dishonest, and definitely an attempt to make a few more quick bucks. In my comparison I did not find even one new recipe in this book. If you own both previous Magnolia Bakery cookbooks, don't waste your money or your shelf space on this one. I would recommend this book only to someone who does not own the first two.
B00006674X|5.0|Definitely a change from the usual Elvis movies.  I remember going to the movies and seeing this one.  I purchased this DVD on sale to finish out my Elvis movie collection.  I am also a Mary Tyler Moore fan and enjoyed her performance as well.
B00122HT04|5.0|This album is what really got me into Avenged Sevenfold. I had listened to \\"City of Evil\\" and \\"Waking the Fallen,\\" which are both decent, but this one is different. The album as a whole has a melancholy, desperate sound to it, and it doesn't slow down except for \\"Gunslinger\\" and \\"Dear God.\\" The vocals are less whiny too, which is a definite plus. Also, the video for \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\" is very jacked up, but very entertaining.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|I haven't picked up a \\"business method\\" or \\"sales pitch\\" book since Zig Zigglar was peddling loafers at Nordstrom, so my expectations were pretty high.  I was referred to the book by a friend who was just wrapping it up and had $20 in my paypal account so I pulled the trigger.    Overall, it was great.  Some of the story lines seemed to zig when it should have zagged but the vast majority of the explanations were spot on.  I didn't find myself questioning much of the material, for better or worse.     My only criticism to the author would be to stay on one level, either enhance the images to match the content, or eliminate the images all together.  The images that were used were clean and concise, but I'm not sure most readers would walk away feeling like they moved the needle.    I usually find these type books dry and inhumanely long.  Either focus too much on the sales part, the psychology part or the obligatory \\"customer service\\" part. This one was remarkably devoid of the dribble and quite fun to read.  Great sense of humor.  Love the real life examples.  Very unique, very real.  It's a recommend, for sure.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|The title was the first thing that caught my eye. The second, the brief summary of \\"One Day\\". The third, the sample available for KINDLE. Fourth, the entire book. I loved being able to actually notice the differences between each year, no matter how subtle or obvious. Watching the relationship change into something incredible was wonderful to read! I do NOT want to spoil the book for anyone who hasn't read it, but I will tell you this...The last 10-30 pages left me tearing up and a bit sobby....Truly amazing book. Worth reading, certainly!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas didn't make Star Wars single-handedly, not even close. He didn't do much of the writing on the 2nd or 3rd, nor did he direct them. Hundreds if not thousands of artists collaborated to give us episodes 4,5, and 6, but whether you're a fan or a historian of their work, its impossible to see it. What we have instead are versions where one maniacal individual has defaced numerous scenes, and completely destroyed others. But hey, lets just pretend that he owes nothing to the people that made these films great against all odds and that we the fans who willed his little media empire into being with our support 30-some years ago shouldn't expect the tiny modicum of respect that it would take to authorize a disk with the un-altered films. It blows my mind that there are people who care enough about Star Wars to defend this, and yet can't wrap their head around why the special ed versions are terrible.
B0029CR13G|4.0|This is my favorite BG album--what could be better than the Silmarillion, heavy metal style? The music is very melodic, hard-hitting, and full of guitar solos that are an integral part of the song writing. I'm less a fan of the interludes--the narrated segments between songs that advance the story line. The problem is, they're more awkward than useful in explaining the story, and I really think I would prefer it if the song's had a musical transition. However, it's very easy to just skip the interludes, and all that's left is glorious metal...and of course, the repeated mispronunciation of \\"iron\\" in \\"Time Stands Still.\\" Ah, it's endearing!
0307593525|5.0|I wanted these cookbooks for a long time but finally after receiving an Amazon gift card I made the purchase and I am so glad I did.  For anyone out there who has doubts about whether these cookbooks will live up the hype let me assure they do!!  I know, I was surprised too but the proof is in each oooh and awwwww you will get from your family and guests.  If you've been hesitating, don't hesitate any longer.  YUMMY!!
B00406UK7S|4.0|I tried to be objective as I watched Neil Marshall's 'Centurion.' Although this is better than Marshall's horrid 'Doomsday' I did expect more.  Marshall has become similar to Tarantino in that he is taking themes and/or elements from old films and throwing them into a new and/or different genre.  His spin on the myth of the 9th is basically his homage to Walter Hill's film 'The Warriors.'  Instead of gangs trapped behind enemy lines attempting to return to Coney Island we have a small band of Roman centurions attempting to return to the safety of Hadrian's Wall.     Fassbender gives a solid and believable performance which carries the film.  The action is fast and brutal - just like mediaeval combat.  The subtitles on the DVD were small, white and not on the screen long enough to read.  I am a firm believer that subtitles should be in yellow and placed on the lower panel of the letterbox - out of the frame. I give it four out of five stars because it seemed this film should have been another twenty or thirty minutes longer - it seemed as thought it was missing some content that would have lent to the overall finality of the film.  The direction, editing, action (fight choreography), set design, art direction and cinematography were all excellent and made this a very visually stimulating film; however it lacks in its content and development that makes this film feel unfinished.
B000002KHH|5.0|It took me a while to get into Black Sabbath, but after buying this album I'm hooked.  Great guitars, classic riffs, & classic Ozzy of course.  I saw a special on the making of this album and realized that every song was great.  We've all heard Iron Man, but Eletric Funeral is a real gem on this album.  Cop it, you won't be sorry!
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I used this device to boost the output from the 3.5mm headphone jack on an MP3 player so that I could attach additional cables on the other end of the Y-Adapter to create 4 RCA channels of output from the original 2 channels of RCA at the end of the Y-Adapter.  Before this amp... splitting the signal from 2 to 4 halved the voltage... so now wiht this amp'd signal the 2-to-4 channel connections now have enough input voltage to play beautifully out of the car-audio 4-ch amplifier I have it hooked-up to in my motorcycle.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|I purchased Christopher Smith's film `Triangle' on a whim.  The purchase was based on his two previous films, `Creep' and `Severance.'  And I was pleasantly surprised. I cannot fully review the film without spoiling its content for future viewers.  If you want a suspenseful film that keeps you guessing I suggest you watch `Triangle.'  The film comes together in its last twenty minutes and infers a cyclical pattern rather than a triangular pattern that the title suggests.
B000005IU1|4.0|I had not heard much about the Stooges until I bought a compilation which included 1969.  It's a great track with strong, strident vocals and fuzz guitars etc.  Influences are likely to include Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones.  Although I also enjoyed No Fun, overall this is not my particular choice in music, but it's well worth seeking out to make your own decision.
B003EYVXUU|4.0|I say this film with trepidation. Would it do justice to the original \\"Let the Right One In\\"? Would it keep integrity with the source material by John Lindqvist (writer)? Would it pander to American viewers with a sanitized MPAA censored distillation? Fortunately no to all of these. If you loved the original, (which I did) then this remake is a worthy bookend to the first. I highly recommend this film to fans of supernatural horror with a humanist sensibility. There are a few changes that are noteworthy: Abby is not a boy, but a girl; her father is not a pedophile but the previous young boy who fell in love with her; its set in New Mexico. Outside of these fairly major changes the film manages to keep true to the original Swedish movie and should not disappoint purists (like myself).
B003GSLX5Y|1.0|Perhaps my great expectations, that a beamed-in classic tutor would avail my life time anguish in writing, dashes now.  The disappointment comes from the poor quality of the original.  Expecting that a few complex rules, poorly offered will replace what requires years to construct, the logic of recording thoughts, this deserves disappointment.  I applaud the low cost and the form.  Don't buy this if you have not already critically examined the terrible offering in the original.  It provides the most awful examples of digression, unclear formatting and arcane usage found in the 15th Century.  For those who understand the original give 4 stars.  For those in true need of beginning principles, 1 star to provide you with practice in editing unreadable matter.  [[ASIN:9562916464 The Elements of Style (Original Edition)]]
B003ZVJFFM|4.0|There's so many movies about scrooge that were made...and its basically the same<br />story over and over again...some with better actors/actresses than others. This<br />take on Christmas Carol is again the same story /movie that were used to..but with<br />a little twist...its computer animated and the movie has just enough ingredients<br />to keep it interesting. Jim Carrey does a good Scrooge and the reward comes in<br />the end where he captures the spirit of Alester Sim...the best scrooge player there<br />ever was.<br /> The movie and music is a little darker than previous versions...but at least it<br />makes it diffirent enough to be enjoyed again.
B0042MEQVG|4.0|I currently have all three DVD's and I think it's going to be to long for #4.  It's good acting and not to much gore,good watching. I first became interested in the story line because of my daughter had gotten the books,and because I like two of the players I got the movies. I think that the actors/actresses did a good job.
B000683VI4|5.0|my mom had same problem. i had to have this movie. so well acted. sad, breaks my heart. but so real. this is a movie people need to watch. so much of this happening today.  great, great movie.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I'm completely satisfied, and am buying another for my wife's vehicle.  The FM modulator does an acceptable job, and the line out is even better.  Great features for the price and the shuffle play is great.  I only wished it handled DRM MP3's and AAC.    Some reviewers mention their unit does not automatically bookmark where it is in a song when shut off, but mine does.  It also remembers bass/treble/volume/frequency, so it's pretty much fire and forget.  Maybe newer models have updated firmware.      Say goodbye to local commercial radio!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I travel a great deal. When I am on a job site I use my Spyderco knife a lot. The blade, which is half regular and half serrated,gets dull. The pocket pal solves that problem, because it sharpens both edges.     I was recently staying with family. I noticed their knives were dull. In our kitchen I have professional sharpening gear. I took this pupppy out of my bag and I was surprised by not only how sharp an edge it made but how fast it did it. Can't go wrong with this tool
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I wasn't sure that I would enjoy the new series.  The first was awesome and I didn't think Riordan could do it again.  I bought this one just to check it out.  It was just as good as the Percy Jackson books.  I really enjoyed it and the new characters are great.  I look forward to the next one this fall.
B0007OASII|5.0|This is a great record although this is supposed to be part 2 of Epica it can stand on its own quite well I feel this album is far better than Epica in the production department also you can buy this one and not feel as if uou missed out on not having the first one that being said buy with confidence every track on here is great.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|I heard so many good reviews of Freedom that I expected to enjoy it. In my opinion there was not a single likeable character and the plot went on and on and on.....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Ever since the release of Twlight and Harry Potter, I have been so careful when it came to purchasing young adult books just because of the overall lack of talent, but this book definitely broke that spell. It is so rare to find a post-apocalyptic book that really ventures outside of the norm and even more rare to find one for young adults. It shocks me that some individuals actually rated this book 1 star; YOU PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. The plot is fast paced and believable. The characters all have such depth, even the minute ones. The action, dear God, it reads like a movie, and you can picture everything in your head perfectly. The only thing I have to say is: this book is not for younger children (hence the fact that its a young adult book). There is violence. Serious violence. But I'm an adult, so it doesnt bother me. I wouldn't let my 10 year old cousin read it, but give her a few years and I definitely would. Down with terribly written books, like Twilight, bring back well-written, excellently plotted books.
0061733199|4.0|Book is pretty good very detailed and easy to get around. Nice pictures and it was written by a former sas soldier. cant go wrong for the price. Also came a day earlier than expected. kudos.
0307454541|5.0|I usually don't like these types of books, but I couldn't put this one down! Although he's not the best writer, he's an excellent storyteller. You become so pulled in by the lives of Salander and Blomkvist that you can't pull your eyes away from the pages. If you're looking for a book with great characters, and exciting storyline, buy this book.
0385341679|5.0|The title of my review pretty much says it all... I love Karens novels, but I'm a little ashamed to say that I was nervous about Shadowfever. How can one book wrap everything up enough to keep me satisfied about the ending?! Its physically impossible! Well let me tell you something, if its physically impossible, then Karen obviously does not adhere to those rules. Not only was I satisfied with the ending, I got answers to 99.9% of my questions, and the other .1% has hope of being answered later in another one of her amazing books! I'm the type of person that becomes emotionally involved in the characters and Karen definatly took me on an emotional roller coaster with this one! There was never a dull moment in this novel. Needless to say I read it in about 8 hours. (I may be a bit biased however because she could write about Barrons scrubbing a toilet and I would find it entrancing...) When the fourth one ended, I bit off just about every nail I had but then I took a deep breathe and told myself to put that in the back of my head until January 18th 2011, because there was no reason wondering what was going to happen until the book came out. Well that worked up until December 2010. I had reread all the books (including the highlanders) and then Shadowfever became my obsession. No kidding, I about drove my sister crazy talking about it. (she hasnt read them and had no idea what I was talking about). I tried to research ideas about what other people thought might happen, I came up with a few of my own theories, I even joined Karen Monings website to get the newsletters. And then I ran across a blog from KAren saying the first two chapters leaked and I would finally see who died. I am a spoiler queen so  I didnt hesitate to open that link up. And when it said who died, I lost it. Im not going to announce it here for those of you who hasnt read it, but be prepared. I realize now that reading that chapter wasnt my best idea, because that was Jan. 15th and to say I walked around with that on my mind for three solid days was no exaggeration. The second I got my book, I flipped to the end to make sure it really did end happy. Never fear. Karen didnt lie when she said there was a HEA :) I realize I have babbled about my own experience so much so let me cut to the chase. READ THIS BOOK! that is AFTER you read the series lol I cannot make it any plainer than that so here it goes again... READ THIS! it was truely an amazing experience and hey, now that All is said and done I'll prolly reread it again...for the fourth time...lol
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I listen to the cd and view the dvd which is included here, though the image is not real detailed, it is pretty good, and the sound of both, the cd and the dvd are superb. I was in the Paul McCartney concert when he came to Miami, and it was real nice, this set of discs are a good recalling of that concert since this one from New York is actually the same as the one I was, they shouldnt've cut the dialog. McCartney always use to say a few words before performing a song.  Unfortunately the disc I ordered from Amazon came damaged during shipping and the second one was faulty. I take the ooportunity to recommend Amazon to protect better their shipments, mostly when they are delicate things like watches, books or cd's. Thet would save lots of money if they are little more careful inspecting what they send, avoiding that way that the customer have to return an Item.   In my case I like the cd's or whatever I buy to come in new condition, that is why I buy it new, and new means with no single dent on the packaging or scratch. So I suggest a good inspection of the merchandise before mailing it and besides to protect it very good so it doesnt suffer during shipping, mostly that UPS seems to treat their packages with no care. The order I received contained this disc from Mc cartney in New york, Band on the run, and the book of MC cartney Biography. The package arrived in time but it came like a car after an accident, all smashed, of course everything was damaged. I kept the book because although got smashed, it was passable. Amazon replaced me the discs with no further problem. Good service.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Easy to install (watch the Cooler Master video on YouTube first though) and don't overdo the thermal grease layer - metal to metal is always better than metal to grease to metal. Probably a good idea to install your RAM before installing this heat sink. I found I had to tighten the nuts on the back part a bit more again after all rest of the installation steps were completed. Fits in a Cooler Master Elite 341 m-ATX Mini Tower Case (just!).    Now I have nothing else to compare it with but it keeps a non-overclocked i5-2500K in the mid 40s C under 100% 4 core CPU load so it seems to do its job well. Using CPU core temperature monitoring software you can see that on idling the CPU after such a load test the core temperatures go down to just above ambient within seconds, so the heat is being removed very quickly and efficiently and yet the included 4-pin fan is very quiet, even under load. A nice touch is that the fan is attached to the heat sink via some padded brackets (and not the plain metal clips as in the video) to reduce vibration. An extra set of such brackets is included in case you want to add another fan yourself.    Excellent value for money all around.
B000JRYOPG|5.0|WOW, really a great movie, a must see movie if you like real movie that are based on what really going on in life, in other countries and in the U.S. One of definitely my top 5 Gangster movies.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm glad its coming out on Blu-Ray its going to be awsome and this is the new trend in movies and sooner or later all movies will be on Blu-Ray and DVD's will be phased out just like the VHS and I wished it would be realsed sooner than Sept I will defintely buy the comeplete saga and ppl needs to stop starting drama over this and keep their negative comments to themselves if you don't want to but it then stop trying to distray ppl from buying it I know ppl don't pay much attentions to reviews and make up their own minds and I want them to do that bc in the end its the person decision weither or not they want to purchase this on Blu-Ray But as for me I so stoked its coming out.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I thought this book sounded interesting - I've always been interested in the subject. I didn't think it would be as good as it was. I literally could not put it down, only stopping when I realized I'd be working on only about 4 hours' sleep if I didn't stop! Of course there are a few disturbing things (it is after all about the Holocaust), but overall the story is about NOW, and how to move on with life.
1594202842|4.0|I was captivated by this book and couldn't put it down.  While I would not want to be as extreme as Amy Chua she has great information, advice, and things to reflect on in this book.  We are too soft today and our children are getting the short end of that.  Since the author's story is still going - her children are still home - there was no definite conclusion.  I thought the last pages of the book were the only weak spot in the entire thing.  I would recommend that every mother read this.  There is something good for every mother (and father) to take away.
1594202842|1.0|After reading and rereading this book my first comment is Amy why is your book only nine on Publisher's Weekly best seller list.  Only number one is acceptable.  Go out and do more interviews.  Why don't you take piano and violin lessions.  And most of all please read When will I be perfect.  That is where your children are headed.  Not to mention your dog<br />And why did you not mention asking for forgiveness for running over your daughters foot but went balistic over some spilled rice.  Why does your husband allow you to act like that toward children who are also his?<br />I hope for your sake that you stop living through your children.  There may be a lapse of years before they produce grandchildren and maybe they will limit your interaction  with them as you did with your mother in law.<br />Although I feel sorry for your children being micro managed in a way that has not been seen since Mr. Murdstone interacted with David Copperfield I feel even more sorry for you.  You did not have the guts to perform in public so you make your kids do it for you.  What else do you have in mind for them.  Or maybe I don't want to know.

B0013FSXT6|4.0|I'll limit my review to just the blu ray presentation rather than the movie itself, since both have been covered but some confusion remains about the high definition and the aspect ratio issues.<br /><br />To start, some of the scenes in this movie will be grainy no matter what format you watch it on BY INTENT of the director. Kubrick made effective use of grainy shots to imply grit and confusion. So if your view of yourself as a new age cinephile is how sharp the picture is, then this movie will annoy you no matter what format you buy it in. It won't take advantage of 1080p in every scene. And that's completely OK from a creative perspective. If that will bug you (because some scenes will translate better on your HD screen) then go with DVD.<br /><br />Now, as to the aspect ratio and transfer issues.  I have read many of the reviews on here and comments across the web. And though Kubrick was burned by conversions from theatrical ratio to full screen home video ratio in the past (and thus filmed some of his movies in 4:3 full screen ratio to keep control over conversions), he did not PREFER his movies to be played in 4:3 ratio).  He simply filmed with a 4:3 aspect while keeping a theatrical aspect in mind for the theatrical release. SO if you buy and play this blu ray version, you will not feel like content has been cut off on the top and bottom. Kubrick planned for both types of presentation as he composed, which may have weakened his final vision (especially now that home and theatre ratios are closer to each other), but you will still get his \\"original vision\\" when you watch this version.<br /><br />Quick comment on the film: despite some fantastical serendipity of timing and the fact that the main characters are people of means, the theme of seeing a veil pulled off of the security and stability of your relationship is something that will likely hit home for many.
1591391105|4.0|This book offered specific and general advice on conducting an intelligent transition. It gave information to understand the type of transition you are making and suggested plans based on the transition type. My transition does not involve managing personnel or setting large scale direction of the organization so some advice was less useful at this point in my career.  I found the advice on managing expections, making early contributions and developing organizational intelligence to be the most valuable. I would recommend this book to anyone making a transition in a professional career.

B003FSTN52|2.0|Ordered and received the item quickly.  The problem lies inside the DVD case.  When you have more than 1 DVD to any bundle/set you should NEVER - EVER - NOT EVER - attempt to stack DVDs on top of the other.  First, they don't stay...thus causing scratches to happen to the DVD.  SECONDLY you waste your customer's time in constantly trying to make sure they are properly placed so that they don't fall off which causes permanent damage to the DVD.       Why not spend 50 cents more and place them back to back, like the other multi-DVD sets I own.    It's not like your not charging a high price to purchase this product.    This really bites.   Now whenever I want to watch it in the future or lend it out to my DVD buddies, I will have to warn them of the cheaply made packaging and issues with the DVDs constantly slipping off and then verify that they are not scratched after each use.    LOUSY PACKAGING.....
B0015DROBO|1.0|I don't understand the positive reviews of this book.  It was dreadfully boring (I don't mind SLOW but it at least has to be interesting).

B002ZG98UK|5.0|This was a Christmas gift to complete the series. The person I gave it to was very happy with the Blu-ray 3D.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|The Ear Force X41 was a breeze to set up.  This was a gift for my son who had it up and working in record time.  The sound is wonderful and allows you to hear details that are just too fine and definitive to hear through the normal television speakers he was using.  I have also used the system and from my own perspective the sound is amazing.  You can really hear the small details (such as a crackling fire) from all different angles.  The wireless functionality makes it easy to sit back and relax or move around without having to deal with an annoying cord.  One of our biggest reasons for this purchase was to eliminate the noise from our downstairs area when he was playing his games.  This system performs that function perfectly while enhancing the gaming experience, making it a dual-win for our family.  I simply cannot say enough good things about this set and I highly recommend this set for any gamer as you will not be disappointed.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|My last headphones were the AKG K272 HD headphones which were around $250.  They dont come close to matching these headphones.  and for less then half of the cost.  The sound quality is better, the headphones are louder in general, and the bass is louder and clearer.  I use these with my computer and ipod and there perfect.  There pretty portable as well because they fold up. I listen to genres from techno to jazz and classical music and these headphones support all of these genres.
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|Well, I'll say first off that Sex in the City fans probably should see this movie.  As a fan, why not?  Your favorite characters all make an appearance in this film and you've been loyal thus far... For the non-fans, this may not be that interesting for you, and for some a bit upsetting as well.    Let's start off with the good.    New York City baby!!! The film starts and ends where we love it - New York, where Carrie starts her ever expected narration of the going's on in her life and that of her friends (cue awesomely bad 80's fashion - loved it!!).  We then move onto Connecticut where everyone gets together for the wedding of the century - that of Anthony and Stanford (best gay friends of Charlotte and Carrie respectively).  You have to experience the wedding for yourself.  I really feel I'd be robbing you if I went into any real detail about it, though I believe most of you know it's quite extravagant, Liza makes an appearance, and it is indeed fun to watch.    It's there that we see a bit of conflict within the lives the girls had so desired and ultimately got:  Charlotte and her family life, Miranda and her work life, Samantha and her love of herself, and Carrie with the love of her life, Big.  Charlotte is dealing with new mother issues (side note, it kills me how much trouble mothers with nannies have, despite having a nanny!!) and the subsequent guilt, Miranda is dealing with a male chauvinist boss at work, Samantha is fighting the effects of age, one vitamin at a time, and Carrie is coming to terms with compromise and what it means to be married.    That's a lot to take in huh?  Well, thanks to Samantha and her connect with Smith (Jason Lewis) Samantha gets the opportunity of a lifetime, visit one of Abu Dhabi's premiere resorts all expenses paid and bring her best girl friends along!  Given the issues at home, all the ladies (with the exception of Charlotte who is brewing up some nanny issues) jump at the chance to go.    And we're off to Abu Dhabi... Now here's where things get dicey with this movie and where those with strong opinions regarding political correctness will definitely have a problem.  I mean, I had a bit of a problem and I'm not the most politically correct person, at least not when it comes to comedy.  I'm all for fantasy, but I'm still unsure about how I felt about it in this setting.  Flat out, our ladies of New York, do not belong in Abu Dhabi - at least, not as they usually are.  And why do we love them?  Because of who they are!! They do and say what we'd often love to do and say in our lives.  But the kind of freedom they enjoy is not legal in Abu Dhabi!!  Forget about what is considered appropriate and what's not, simple things we do in our normal everyday interactions (hugging, holding hands, etc..) are illegal in Abu Dhabi, man!!! So it just didn't work.  During a conversation I had about the movie, another very relevant fact came out as well.  Samantha was there ultimately for business and as an astute business woman, you think she would have exercised some restraint for a potentially lucrative business deal.  Yet another truth about our girls that wasn't well represented here. And in all honesty, it is really difficult to watch the so-called woman's lib scene in this movie when the reality would have ended so, so differently.  I can't even talk about it without giving away key info on the film (and I hate ruining films for people), aside from the fact that I doubt such disrespect would be shown...    What was good about Abu Dhabi?  The colors, the scenery, the settings, the crazy fashions and Charlotte.  Kristin Davis was given some good moments in this film.    So, see it. If nothing else it will spark great conversation.

B002ZG996I|2.0|Starring Jennifer Lopez and Alex O'Loughlin in what turned out to be a very disappointing film. Zoe (J-Lo) is a strong capable single woman with babies on her mind. However, her efforts to nab a respectable man with whom to make these babies, has been unsuccessful.  Deciding she can do it alone, Zoe gets artificially inseminated.  But wouldn't ya know right after the procedure, she meets Stan (Alex O'Loughlin), the man of her dreams.    Now really, none of this is all that far-fetched. Plenty of women are going it alone, so the premise of the film was fine.  The problem was the execution.  Jennifer was cute and silly, and Alex was handsome and sweet, but together they were not so believably compatible.    I typically look for the good in movies before trashing them for what's bad, only in this case, the bad was so bad, that I couldn't even see passed it to find the good. Sigh~ it's so disappointing because I really wanted to like this movie.  Aside from the lack of chemistry between the two leads, there was the lack of chemistry with her best friend Mona (Michaela Watkins).  In fact, that whole best friend character was horrible.  She was a constant source of negativity-all the time.  I'm sure her snide comments and crude behaviors were supposed to be executed in a funny way, however Michaela's redundant style of comedy was boring and So. Not. Funny.  Everything she did was specifically to get a laugh and got nothing.  Her comedy was too forced, with gags done a million times before, and better.    Which brings me to another problem I had with this film, why was every Mother or mother-to-be in this movie portrayed so horribly?!?  The single mothers are made out to be loopy buffoons with outlandish ideals on motherhood; I already mentioned Mona the best friend and her hateful personality - the only normal female was Zoe - until her \\"symptoms\\" of Pregnancy turned her into an idiot slob with no manners. They were all so unappealing that the attempt to give them redeeming qualities was too little, too late.    The funniest part of this movie (or only funny part) was played by Anthony Anderson as a dad that offers his ideas on the different aspects of parenthood.    Ugh.  See this film if you want to support Jennifer Lopez no matter her mistakes.  Otherwise, I sadly can not recommend it to anyone.

B001M4YZ90|5.0|Wow, I loved this movie!  Just watched it and I want to watch it again.    RockNRolla is about two guys trying to get a loan to buy a building.  Simple enough right?  Problem is they have past criminal records and that forces them to seek funding from somewhere other than the bank.  When \\"planning\\" falls through for their acquisition, they end up in debt and must pay within a month or face all sorts of problems.    I've enjoyed other Guy Richie movies, most recently Sherlock Holmes, but I have never actually sought out his films.  Truthfully, I don't really remember much about Lock, Stock and Two Smokin Barrels except that they were up to no good and... well, that's about it.  But I do remember Revolver.  Did anyone see that film starring Jason Statham, Andre 3000, Ray Liota and that big Italian guy?  Maybe I'll review that too....    Guy Richie has an obvious style, and it really does work, at least for me.  The way he frames people, the snappy dialogue and even the narration - some people don't like narration, but I happen to enjoy it. In fact, in a movie like Like Water for Chocolate, I really would have appreciated some narration. Loved the book, but had I not read it prior to seeing the film I would have been totally lost.  But I'm off topic...    On top of his stylized way of shooting, he does some great casting. I think Rock N Rolla came out after Smokin Aces (it was sooo not as good and stupidly, that's the one I saw), and I think I kind of lumped the two films together in my mind skipping this much better film. Want to know what brought me back?    FAN GIRL ALERT!!!!!    Gerard Butler baby!!  Do you know how unbelievable it is to me that I have been sleeping on the goodness that is Gerard?  The first movie I saw starring him was The Ugly Truth (loved it - All haters of the Heiglmeister zip it. I've loved her since My Father the Hero).  So since I loved that movie and 300 had been sitting in my shelf for close to a year, I figured I should find out what allthe hype was about (apparently 300 is enjoyed by women as much or even more than men...) and Gerard did not disappoint!!!  Yeah, then I looked him up on Netflix to see what other films he's been in and man! He's all over the place!!!  Did you know he starred in the Phantom of the Opera movie? As the Phantom?  Singing?!?  Well anyway, RockNRolla popped up and I decided this was going to be my next Gerard Butler film.  Idris Elba also starred and well, he's quite easy on the eyes as well.    Ok, now that I've gotten that off my chest back to the movie.  Mr. Ritchie loves colorful dialogue and I have to say, those accents, while not nearly as posh as those found in Austen films, are still quite fetching when uttered from the lips of (you guessed it) Gerard Butler.  Ludacris and Jeremy Piven, shut the hell up, you're messin up my movie.  But in all seriousness, the writing was fun and real, though sometimes it got a little to \\"deep\\" for my semi-shallow mind (I don't know what Johnny Quid was talking about at the piano) but that didn't stop my enjoyment of the film.  In terms of action, there really wasn't much, except for the big scene with the Russians  ( a laugh-out-loud moment).   RockNRolla is more of an \\"Oh the terrible webs we weave when we practice to deceive...\\" type of movie.  I think GuyRitchie had lots of fun piecing together these characters and their respective stories.    My two favorite scenes are (And I'm sorry for making this an \\"I love Gerard\\" fest, but he was awesome in this film) Gerard and his scenes with Handsome Bob as well as the \\"Russians\\". Priceless.  Props to Mark Strong (also played the main baddie in Sherlock Holmes), as the connecting thread to all these groups throughout the movie.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|Okay so the song is a little creepy because it tares into the heart and makes one think about their own death. However, it is not at all about suicide, instead the beautiful song \\"If I die Young\\" applies to all of us young and old. We all die young no matter how old we are, there is always going to be loved ones who will morn for us when the times comes to be laid down to rest. We all dream of dying peacefully and remembered, we all want to go out of this world with words of love. That's what I think this song is getting at, not suicide.   The Band Perry is lacking depth in a few of their other songs. However their single \\"If I die Young\\" is a hit with originality, depth, and a classy non-pop country tempo. I'd recommend previewing their other songs before purchasing the album as most of the music is a little grass roots popsie and they could do a little better on their vocals, which I found surprising considering how well sung their single is.

1594481717|5.0|This book is a compilation of research and observations of what has been occurring and is occurring in our society. There is definitely a move from an information society to a conceptual one with an emphasis on design, humanity, and spirituality.

Fail to understand and implement the concepts described in this book will result in losing customers and eventually the business.
B000FZETKC|5.0|Do I really need to tell you all how classically great this movie is? I'd you haven't seen or heard of this movie, you're either too young, too old, or have been living under a rock. Watch it, because they sure don't make teen movies like this anymore.

B0036TGSIK|4.0|Easy A is a cute coming-of-age teen flick but it's not as funny as I thought it would be. I found the premise of the film to be interesting but some of the jokes fall flat. This film is saved by the adorable Emma Stone. Stone is likeable, charming, and a has strong comedic timing for someone so young. She keeps this movie above float, and of course so does the still hilarious Lisa Kudrow. I usually like Amanda Bynes in other movies but I found her performance as a judgemental Christian girl to be rather wooden and annoying. Easy A makes a lot of references to John Hughes films which I liked but without Emma Stone, this film would have been just so-so.

B000067JBN|5.0|Well, I've read some of the negative reviews and cannot agree with them. Granted, some people prefer the original 60's movie to this one, particularly if they were kids and easily impressed. But just because a movie's old, doesn't mean it's THE BEST version.     Concerning the question of intellect, both are geared towards the medium intellect of the general populus. That said, it is still a well done, well acted movie. What would H.G. have thought of the job Simon did? There's no way of knowing.     Folks, there DO exist movies that out-do the original. This is one of those movies...it bests the original in the acting, the script--the whole production. Get both versions and judge for yourselves. They are both reasonably priced.
B00425S1H8|5.0|The adapter works. It works with the 64 bit Windows 7 which is now a standard issue OS. Just plug it in and all the drivers get installed, and one serial port gets added, and that is just what I need. The port can then be set up in the control panel.  Construction of the adapter is fine. Plastic could have been better, but that would have probably driven the cost up. The cable is a reasonably high quality one, properly braided, appropriately long and pleasant to touch.

B000I0QKDS|5.0|This expanded version of \\"Truth\\" a seminal album from The Jeff Beck Group makes this the ultimate edition in terms of covering Beck's singles prior to the album as well as alternate takes of material that ended up on the final album. Beck had just been fired from The Yardbirds and signed with producer Mickie Most as a recording act. Most convinced (against his Beck's better judgment)Jeff Beck to sing lead vocals on his single \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\". Jeff just wanted to play guitar and have another singer front the band.<br /><br />When \\"Truth\\" was released there wasn't quite anything like it--Jeff Beck along with vocalist Rod Stewart (Faces), guitar player turned bassist Ron Wood (The Birds, Faces, The Rolling Stones)and drummer Mick Waller (on the main album although an early member of the band drummer Aynsley Dunbar who achieved fame with the Jefferson Starship and Journey appeared on singles)introduced a heavier rock sound six months before the release of the first Led Zep album.<br /><br />This version of \\"Truth\\" remastered by engineer Peter Mew sounds quite good bringing the full power of the band to CD. I prefer the 2000 remaster by Chris Athens but this remaster is very, very close in terms of tone and dynamic range. If you add in the fact that this has eight bonus tracks NOT on the previous releases, this edition becomes essential.<br /><br />These eight bonus tracks include the \\"Love is Blue\\"/\\"I've Been Drinking\\", \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\"/\\"Beck's Bolero\\" (with a backwards guitar overdub missing from the album version)and \\"Tallyman\\"/\\"Rock My Plimsoul\\" (an earlier take)plus take one of \\"You Shook Me\\" and \\"Blues De Luxe\\" are added on here as well giving us everything that was released or recorded around the time of the album all in one place.<br /><br />The packaging is also quite good--we get a deluxe booklet that discusses the making of the album with interview material from Jeff Beck as well.<br /><br />This is an essential album that paved the way for a major change in rock music providing a blueprint for much of 1970's rock (although the album came out in 1968)and influenced everyone from Jimmy Page to John Lennon.

B00004W50Z|5.0|\\"Stage Fright\\" stands as The Band's most emotionally direct album; \\"Music from Big Pink\\" and \\"The Band\\" are albums about other people and their troubles while \\"Stage Fright\\" features music and lyrics that seem more direct and more largely autobiographical than the first two.<br /><br />Just as fame and fortune began to cause the group to unravel (we'd see the full effect of this on \\"Cahoots\\"), \\"Stage Fright\\" is their third masterpiece. Robbie Robertson wasn't the sole voice as a songwriter yet either and that's for the good--although he was the most prolific songwriter Richard Manuel, Rick Danko and Levon Helm each brought unique qualities to the songs they contributed to/wrote as well.<br /><br />There are two versions of this album each with unique elements. One version (the released one)features 3 mixes done by Glyn Johns with the rest largely done by The Band and John Simon. The second features mixes done by Todd Rundgren. The latter was released as a limited edition gold CD from DCC and fans may want to seek it out as the mixing choices are different and Rundgren's version is less slick sounding to my ears.<br /><br />The reissue sounds quite nice and features some of the Rundgren remixes as bonus tracks. The remastering by Andrew Sandoval doesn't go for the in your face style that is so popular today although it is louder and a bit more compressed than the original CD release. There aren't any previously unreleased \\"new\\" songs on this set. The liner notes are quite informative as well.<br /><br />Recommended.
B004DK5CW4|2.0|Diane Lane is NO Penny Chenery. If you really want to be inspired by this story of Secretariat, watch, Kentucky Derby week, ESN Classic's Sportscentury program made about Secreatariat when he was named in the top 100 athletes in 2000.  It has real footage and people from that time and actual footage of Secretariat's races.  There is at least one glaring historical inaccuracy in the film, and since it's my understanding Chenery Tweedy served as a consultant, I'm surprised she didn't note it.  It's well known to fans of racing that it was NOT Secretariat that first put the Meadow back in the limelight when Penny Chenery took it over for her father. It was his stablemate Riva Ridge that put them back on the thoroughbred racing map. It would be the year AFTER that, that Secretariat won the Triple Crown. And I'm sorry, but I detested the soundtrack. Disney should have hired John Debney (who did Dreamer) or one of the better composers. Listening to \\"Oh Happy Day\\" during the Belmont race sequence until the end of the movie was not an effective soundtrack for that sequence, at least for me.
0345505387|5.0|This was the very first \\"graphic novel\\" I've ever read and it was a real pleasure to read.  It had good flow and I loved the new character and new enhancment to the plot.

B000FC130E|5.0|This is one of my favorite Gaiman books.  He really puts the readers inside this strange alternate world.  Dark, funny and compelling is probably the best way to describe this work.  Loved the Door character and the entire concept he develops through her.  What makes this book even better is that it is not easy to categorize into any of the major genres.  We need more books like Neverwhere that bend fantasy in a completely new and interesting manner.

It's been criticized as a cliche mushy love story disguised as a war movie but it's not true, i believe it has the right ingredients of a successful blockbuster from all three filmmakers and really depicts WWII in a glorious fictional kind of manner. Who cares about accuracy and all that? i think he does a small bit of historical accuracy even on some casting like Cuba Gooding Jr. who made a damn good role of playing the first black American soldier to get the cross-medal and i love Hans Zimmer's brilliant score. The action sequences are well executed by one of the biggest hollywood action maestros Bay and it's a very well made movie that is a must see for everyone as i loved it since i saw it in theaters before my graduation for it's a sad, sometimes uplifting and dark War drama that even has a bit of humor.<br /><br />This 4-Disc DVD set contains the Extended R-rated Director's Cut as intended by Bay but had to tone down some language and graphically gory violent scenes to get a PG-13 rating for everyone to see. There's awesome extras like three audio commentaries, Music video of the hit song \\"There You'll Be\\" by Faith Hill, Preview of National Geographic Beyond The Movie: Pearl Harbor, Journey to the Screen The Making of Pearl Harbor 47 minute featurette, teaser and trailer, super 8 montage, boot camp, video production diary, One Hour Over Tokyo 50 minute documentary, Unsung Heroes of Pearl Harbor 50 minute documentary, Oral History The Recollections of a Pearl Harbor nurse 3:36 minute featurette, interactive attack sequence which is a multi-angel multi-audio presentation at the look of the major sequence, animatic attack, Deconstrucing destruction: a conversation with Michael Bay and Eric Brevig, Photo gallery, Interactive timeline on the clashes of American and Japanese culture and DVD-Rom stuff.sic video of the hit song \\"There You'll Be\\" by Faith Hill, Preview of National Geographic Beyond The Movie: Pearl Harbor, Journey to the Screen The Making of Pearl Harbor 47 minute featurette, teaser and trailer, super 8 montage, boot camp, video production diary, One Hour Over Tokyo 50 minute documentary, Unsung Heroes of Pearl Harbor 50 minute documentary, Oral History The Recollections of a Pearl Harbor nurse 3:36 minute featurette, interactive attack sequence which is a multi-angel multi-audio presentation at the look of the major sequence, animatic attack, Deconstrucing destruction: a conversation with Michael Bay and Eric Brevig, Photo gallery, Interactive timeline on the clashes of American and Japanese culture and DVD-Rom stuff.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|has Perhaps Ben Affleck is not the best actor around (and by far not the worst!) but the two films he has directed \\"Gone baby gone\\" and \\"The town\\" are excellent thrillers and don't forget that he shared an Oscar with Matt Damon for the screanplay of Will Hunting.
0439023513|3.0|Although Mockingjay takes up where [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] should have, it still does not fulfill its potential. Katniss's character is developed and the plot moves forward (unlike in the second book), however, both just fizzle out.<br /><br />The author misses a major opportunity to invite readers to examine their ethics.... well, she does so half-heartedly by telling rather than showing, but it is hard to say more without being snarky. I have no quibbles with the direction of the plot, it is not my story to tell, but I felt that the story suffered from the first person narration.<br /><br />For an excellent book about an unwitting revolutionary leader, read [[ASIN:0765318237 Moving Mars: A Novel]] by Greg Bear.
B004B32532|5.0|If youre looking at this review you know who Jodorowsky is and have probably seen Santa Sangre.  The film is great and the Blu Ray treatment was excellent.  The transfer looked great and its packed with extras.  The real great part of the blu ray for me was the audio commentary track which i found extremely interesting.<br />I hope that El Topo and The Holy Mountain get a quality blu ray release soon as well.

1401322425|5.0|Many recipes in this book pass the very first test of a good recipe....they are delicious. They also pass the 2nd test....they are simple. These are from his show \\"Jamie at Home\\" and sometimes they are hard to follow on the screen especially because he references metric measurements. Watch his show, then if you like what you see. Get the book to make they recipes easy to execute.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|After all the CG c...p, it's good to have one of these 2 hour diversions with proven actors/actresses comfortably going thru their paces with no effort.  Willis and Freeman are reunited after being in a similar type of film (Lucky Slevin, which is also good), although Freeman don't get to do much in this film. Malkovich, whom I enjoy immensely hams it up along with Mirren.  Not much to the story - just relax and watch the pros do their thing.

031606792X|1.0|I LIKED the Twilight series at one point. Then I read the last book. And it was such nonsense, weird, and remarkably anti-climactic that it ruined it for me. This happened to the point where I reread the other books and couldn't even enjoy them anymore. The plot holes and writing style (which I was ignoring in case the plot holes were going to be filled in) were considerably clearer.      When I read it, it just came out, so I was considerably younger. I say, if you are a genuine reader, and your like for the series has declined, don't read this book. It ruins it for you.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Wonderful collection of the entire series all boxed together.  Great gift.  My daughter and her husband love it.
031603438X|5.0|[[ASIN:031603438X Life]] ~  I absolutely loved this book. It was like sitting & talking to Keith, listening to him tell his life story. Brutally honest, no-holds-barred. But the thing that shines through is his kindness; yeah, he's a crazy rock n' roller, but what a big heart. Here you see the side of Keith that is not just a cigarette smoking, partying rock star. Of course, there's a lot of that too, told very forthrightly.     Many have said that there is a lot of Mick Jagger bashing in this book. I didn't think so. There are some negative comments, but they're usually follwed by a remark on how much Keith loves Mick.    I found when I was finished this book that I loved Keith Richards even more, that I wished I could meet him, not because he's a star, but because he's a really nice guy.
0802473156|4.0|Great information that has made a positive change in my life.  I used this book along with The 5 Love Languages for Singles for my very first book club on my radio show.  We loved the content and my listeners joined in with overwhelming insights during our round table discussion of the books.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|I have just watched the Never Let Me Go DVD for the first time today, and I highly recommend it. I had read the novel when it first came out and found myself haunted by the doomed characters and their tragic story. I couldn't wait to see the film, but since it never played in my city, I had to wait for the DVD to be released.    I believe this film brings the novel to life and that those who loved the book will be taken with the movie even though it is not a literal rendering. In some ways, the film is superior. Two brief scenes that showed young donors with missing limbs and eyes underlined the horror of their sacrifice in a way the book glossed over.    The film captures the look and spirit of the novel brilliantly. The actors are magnificent. The wardrobe and settings are all dead on. I don't see how anything about the film could have been improved.     I very much enjoyed the extras included with the disc. The interviews with cast and crew were fascinating -- for them the project was clearly a labor of love. And the short feature on the the fictional National Donor Programme with its medical forms and promotional brochures sent shivers down my spine. So even if you've already seen the film, it would be worth buying the DVD just to watch the extras.    I am sure this movie is destined to become a classic and that I will watch this DVD again and again.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Very interesting book, read Kindle version cover to cover in 4 days.   What if everything you thought you knew about eating fats and having a low-fat low-calorie diet was wrong.  Amazing, interesting, life-changing completely recommended.  Unbelievable to learn that everything in the media, everything we are told about eating low-fat, is completely incorrect.  Wow, what a concept that fats in diet <>  (does not equal) fats in you (an animal fat cell doesn't just become a fat cell in a human).  And we hear that in media every single day, makes you believe its true, only find out, that when you examine the science it doesn't hold up.  Why my low-fat cereal I used to eat every morning had over 45g carbs, and was making me fat -- who would've known!      Its no wonder that even though we've been told to eat a low-cal low-fat diet by every source imaginable, that our American lifestyle is the fattest on the planet.  And imagine all that exercising increases your hunger and makes you eat more -- course we all knew that but just didn't use our common sense.       This book reminds me of that movie \\"Sleeper\\" where the guy wakes up and its now recommended to eat candy bars.  Now, that's still not okay, but finding out that eating meat and fats doesn't contribute to fats in your body is amazing, and just totally flies in face of everything I've ever heard (and I'm over 45).      First four days eating only low/no-carb diet, lost over 1 lb per day.  And my blood pressure went down so fast, that I had to get off my meds (check with your doctor first).  I thought eating fats would clog your arteries and increase your blood pressure -- wrong.   This works!!      Remember this is a long-term lifestyle, not just a temporary diet.  Wow, now I can go back to eating bacon and eggs like I did when I was a teenager and not feel guilty about it, or eat a steak or sausage, oh boy, bring it on.   And I've already been doing that and losing weight -- that's completely opposite of what I'vebeen told all my life.   I just couldn't get any lower on my low-fat lifestyle and feeling starved all the time.  Now I can eat all the meats and fats I want, feel good about it, feel full, and lose even more weight than before.  It's not a hoax or snake oil, but real science that really works, not the false messages and media you've been hearing up to know.
159448385X|5.0|I loved this book, and would strongly recommend it.  After reading Mr. Hosseini's first book, The Kite Runner, I was afraid this book would not be as good.  I was wrong, it's even better.  Besides being a good read overall, it gives an insight to the Afghani culture.
B00000DGUY|4.0|While there is certainly a great hour to be had here, I can think of at least 12 more songs you would want to hear without getting one bit dilutive.  So while this is indeed a great bargain, I suggest you pass it up and go for all six original albums instead.
B00004XMV6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. Very sexy story, although, it does become quite disturbing at the end. I recieved this item in a timely manner and in good condition for a used DVD. I have no complaints and would buy from this seller again.  Thank you.
0596009208|4.0|I bought this book. It is pretty good if you have not programmed before but if you are completely new to programming then I would advised to look somewhere else.  This book does assume you understand a little bit about programming.  Also, I don't like the style of this book. The book tries to be way too entertaining with its language, especially when they have a \\"conversation\\" between the complier and the JVM. You really need to look through the book to see if you like this style. It really depends on the person.     If you are absolutely new to programming then I would highly suggest 'Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach' (2nd Edition).  This book will be better for this.
B004B8DH98|1.0|...Then watch this movie ever again. The movie was so bad that I actually took time to leave a review to spare anyone from the hell that is this movie. I never leave reviews. This movie was more pointless than a nun in a whorehouse, just absolutely senseless. I am not sure what the writers, directors, producers, or actors were thinking. You sit and wait, and wait, and wait, and nothing happens until the end when everyone dies. There were many instances in which things happened that had nothing to do with what was happening and left you clueless as to what the hell was going on. Clooney is his usual self, terrible. He can only act one way, himself, which begs the question as to why he was ever cast in that horrible batman movie.<br /><br />I though new world was a awful movie, but this honestly takes the cake. The main difference between those two horrible movies, both of which could be used to extract information from terrorists, was the acting. The actors in New World seemed to actually care, and earnestly tried to salvage that horrible train wreck of a movie, whereas The American lacks everything that would make a good movie, good. Acting is sub par, the script and everything about it, are stupid and could be written better by a drunken monkey on a few hits of acid. The only nice thing about the movie is some of the scenery, which left me pondering how awesome it would be to go visit that place, which is how I spent my time while being tortured by this agonizing movie.<br /><br />Stay away from this, unless maybe your kid was out all night doing something bad, sit him or her in front of this movie and I guarantee you they will talk and probably never disobey you again for fear of this inhumane punishment.
030746363X|5.0|Worth the few bucks for all the ideas and information.  I'm trying it all now to test it out for myself.   I believe the \\"everything popular is usually wrong\\" notion is usually right. (unless of course Tim makes this notion popular - in which case I don't know what to do.)  Applaud Tim for experiementing and challenging assumptions.  I also filled this out cuz I want Tim to beat George W. Bush with the number of reviews!!!!!
B003UESJH4|5.0|The King-Emperor George VI (of the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, India, et al.) was frequently overshadowed in his life, and he has been mostly overshadowed in history ever since his death, by turns by the memories of his father George V, his brother Edward VIII, and his daughter Elizabeth II, our current sovereign (as well as by his most famous prime minister, Sir Winston Churchill).  He reigned for a tumultous 16 years in the middle of the 20th century, which saw profound changes in Britain, the Commonwealth, and the Empire.  But his fairly low-key personality has kept him mostly unknown to those not interested in the history of the British Crown.  Until this film, that is.  \\"The King's Speech\\" puts George VI front-and-centre in the popcultural eye, and does so with considerable aplomb.  It is a superb entry in the period film genre, which is often negatively termed \\"Oscar bait\\".  Spoilers follow.    Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George, Duke of York (Colin Firth, in a performance that will win him the Oscar, deservedly), is the second of King George V's (Michael Gambon, one of a number of \\"Harry Potter\\" alums putting in an appearance) six children.  He has a serious speech impediment that keeps him from successfully carrying out public speaking engagements, to his considerable consternation.  All attempts to work through this affliction seem to fail, but his wife Elizabeth, the Duchess of York (Helena Bonham Carter, sublime fun in a supporting role), keeps looking.  She eventually comes across Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush, dialling it way down from his normal mode to great effect), an Australian speech therapist (and failed actor) known for being a bit unorthodox in his approach.  As you would expect, what Logue has on offer is just the ticket.  And good thing, too, as Albert's feckless older brother David/Edward VIII (Guy Pearce, having good fun, though it's hard to buy him as Colin Firth's older brother) makes a royal botch of things shortly after ascending the throne.  Now King George VI (due, not to the movie's suggestion of the Germanic connotations of Albert, but an obscure bit of royal naming politics dating back to Victoria's husband Albert), public speaking is a matter of real national importance, particularly with World War II on the horizon.    Colin Firth is superb as George VI.  His performance as George Falconer in last year's \\"A Single Man\\" was justly acclaimed, and here, as a different George, he does himself one better.  He invests the character with incredible physical language; stammers are difficult to portray without crossing into caricature, which would be deadly here (and has in the past created an undeserved sense of humour about a serious psychological problem).  In middle age, Firth is emerging as one of the best dramatic actors currently working.  Geoffrey Rush, acting opposite Firth, is almost as good, and surprisingly shies away from what has become his signature hammy theatricality.  Helena Bonham Carter is, as stated, quite fun, with a few moving moments, though her role is not as substantial as either of the other two.  It's lovely to see her doing some more subtle work compared to what has become her main cinematic type, the psycho woman (not that that's not quite enjoyable too).  The supporting cast is littered with gems, also including Firth's \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" costar Jennifer Ehle as Logue's wife Myrtle and Sir Derek Jacobi (he of the stammering title character of \\"I Claudius\\") as Archbishop Lang.  The lone discordant note is Timothy Spall (Harry Potter alum #3) as Winston Churchill.  Admittedly, it is probably difficult to portray an icon of Churchill's stature without doing a bit of caricature, but Spall's interpretation is way too broad; but he's only in three fairly brief scenes, so it doesn't drag things down.    The film has taken a few knocks on the issue of historical accuracy.  As an historian with considerable interest in the history of appeasement, there are indeed some things altered here, mainly relating to Churchill's involvement in the abdication crisis (he was a staunch supporter of Edward, not George) (the film also gives Stanley Baldwin more credit than he deserved; in fact, he didn't realize he had been wrong when resigning in 1937, he was simply ready to retire).  The film largely skips over the actual appeasement debates of 1938, cutting from the coronation to the outbreak of war.  Much as with Spall's subpar work, this is peripheral to the main story, which is the relationship between George VI and Logue; the bulk of the film is set pre-coronation, and changing the things people object to would not affect the narrative in any substantial way.  In my view, simply call it dramatic license (it worked fine for Shakespeare, after all).  It's completely normal for historical fiction, and the alterations are hardly important to the film anyway.    What the film is about, as previously stated, is the friendship between the King and Logue.  There are a few class and nationality issues at play here, as Logue is both a commoner and the colonial.  The film is expert in depicting a moving male friendship, very welcome at a time when \\"bromance\\" movies are largely concerned with crass and meaningless issues.  \\"The King's Speech\\" is much more like its primary Best Picture rival, \\"The Social Network\\", than most people would notice:  both are about socially awkward individuals dealing with the advent of new communications technologies.  In this case, it's radio.  There are also many thematic similarities with 2006's \\"The Queen\\", to which \\"The King's Speech\\" could be considered an unofficial prequel.  The script by David Seidler is witty and well-structured, and one can see evidence of Seidler's (who also had a stammer as a child) personal interest in his subject.  Director Tom Hooper has been slagged in some quarters as unworthy for consideration as Best Director this year, but he actually does an excellent job of moving beyond the standardMerchant-Ivory template for period films.  It's not revolutionary work by any means, but it's very strong nonetheless.    Oh, and the R-rating is an absolute joke.  A few (okay, more than a few) swear words in two scenes keep out anyone under 17, whereas they can go see any of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films' depictions of massive battlefield slaughter without issue.  There is nothing in this film unsuitable for anyone in junior high school or above.    Highly recommended.
0385341008|5.0|I wish this author and storyteller had lived to tell another tell.  This one was absorbing and innocent, quirky and moving. Definitely one I recommend to others.

I saw no difference tho ans there's no glasses makes no sense.I do like the movie all together jus 3d effects could be better.
0887431453|5.0|This is a perfect book for a 3-4 year old who loves learning.  My daughter spends hours doing page after page- and since it is such a big book, I don't have to stop her and tell her to \\"save\\" some pages for later.  There are plenty of pages to do, and it works well for us to do together to teach shapes, letters, numbers, colors, and sounds.  I would highly recommend this book for an at-home preschool activity book.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I loved this film!!  Thought it was very realistic and a great love story with a lot of sexy HOTTTT steamy moments.  Buy this movie you will not be disappointed.
B00006BTC7|5.0|The vinyl is nice and heavy and sounds great. The packaging blew me away. The plastic \\"shrinkwrap\\" is actually a plastic dust jacket. It is perforated along the edge, and when you tear it off you are left with a dust jacket. Brilliant! The rest of the packaging is great, Matador really did a top notch job on this.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|This book was slow compared to the previous two books in the series. There was too much background on Sapo and the Section on the first half. The second half got better, and the trial at the end was the saving grace. I watched the movie before I finished the book (I would normally not do this), and only for that reason I decided to finish the book (so that I could read the original version of the trial).<br />I was expecting that Camilla, Lisbeth's twin sister, would make an appearance, since she was mentioned on the previous book. I was disappointed to not learn more about her, but maybe this was a planned story for the following books.<br />All in all, the Stieg Larsson series is phenomenal. It opened up the American mindset to foreign fiction, and I hope this trend continues.
0385732554|5.0|I bought this book for my 12 year old daughter for school assignment. She was so into this book. i havent had the chance to read it but was able to here it from her in detail, chapter by chapter. I read reviews on how some parents feel this story wasn't appropriate for their children. I think keeping an open mind, listening, interacting with your childs thoughts and a wonderful teacher to help through the book has made it a positive time with me and my daughter. We have had a difference of opinions throughout this book so now I get to read it and she gets to help me go through the story. I am glad I chose not to read the book first. With a daughter of this age and myself not being able to encourage reading (which she has started to lose interest in) this story has opened her mind and has purchased a book outside the reading outline to read. I am very grateful to Lois Lowry.
B000002B7O|3.0|This is baffling to me in that the original version is usually given 2 stars out of five and occasionally 3.  To believe that a remaster no matter how brilliant can raise the overall appraisal of an album by as much as it seems to have done is hard to fathom.  It almost seems that a different album is being listened to.  Was the original really that poor,i do not believe so.  The same group played on it and Randy played just as brilliantly on the original as did everyone involved.  Each to their own opinion.  I dont mind being shot down in flames over this,but to me the improvement is definitely their sonically speaking but it does not change the fact that the original was a great album that has been along with Blizzard been made to seem as the weakest album in Ozzy's catalogue.

B000FC10MU|1.0|Because I wasted so much time trying to read this book I'm leaving this short.<br /><br />I was told that this was a great book by a hand full of people and they said I would love it. The premise was great, it was nice and long so I figured I was in for a really interesting ride. That ride began a bit slow, but had some promise. Halfway through the book I found myself skipping over pages of useless banter and having to start another book just to finish American Gods. Finally, I just started to speed read through the last hundred so pages until the painful ending.<br /><br />Now I have read plenty of over-hyped books and this one takes first prize. Normally, I'll give books I will NEVER read again to the library, but I felt so cheated and pissed when I finished this garbage that's exactly where it went; the recycle bin.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|I have only read the diet portion of this book.  Pending some contradictions on Ferris' part, it is a pretty awesome diet/lifestyle change.    I have been on the program for 3 weeks and have lost 10 lbs.  I feel better, less tired, my body is in better shape and working order than it's ever been. I actually have motivation and energy to do stuff.    The first week was tough, but after seeing results and feeling a difference, I have stuck with the plan only to be impressed further.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Great movie for the witty fan.  Plenty of fast jokes and quick humor.  I loved the roommate dynamic, the band dynamic, and the way the relationships progressed.  Highly suggested for those who have played videogames from the 80's & 90's.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|My word, an interesting change of direction from the Decemberists.  Very, very country, following and i do mean following, Duke and the King, Monsters of Folk, and all the others who have gone down the 70s singer/songwriter path.  Its lovely but is it cutting edge?  As per normal Decemberists??  I'm giving it 4 because i just love it not love love it.  A fantastic album which has similarities to Mumford and sons, lotsa people will/should get into, regardless of genre, but because it is commercial won't be given the kudos it deserves despite being truly classic.  I guess this means they sold out!  No way!
B000024KZQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of ALL time.  I have watched it so much that I know the entire script by heart.  This is FAMILY entertainment at it's best, and you dont seem much of THAT anymore. DeBorah
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Before I begin I'd like to say that if any of you have read negative reviews dismiss them. This book is spectacular. This is coming from a girl who has read harry potter and the eragon books, both of which I would recommend. I thought I would never again be lost in that world where time and space matter not, where you would stay up till 5am just to keep reading. Where nothing can distract you. But that was before I read the Hunger Games.  I found myself reading every moment I could, during dinner, whilst brushing my teeth, everywhere! Every moment I wasn't reading, felt like a waste. When I wasn't reading I wanted to be reading. I have just finished reading the Hunger Games for the 4th time, and tomorrow I will begin again. I can't stop reading, can't put them down. Mark my words, this story will stay with you forever. Read this story and read it now!!!
B001TH8UUA|5.0|An HDMI has to do only a few things well, but if it fails in any of those tasks, it is worthless.  These cables work well and support the Audio Return Channel built into most newer televisions.  It saves having to use an optical audio or other audio cable and makes installation more elegant.  I have had no problems whatsoever.
0446195529|5.0|I have read and own over a dozen David Baldacci novels, and I keep going back to them for thrilling readers that lead the reader on a journey they will not forget by the end. In HELL'S CORNER, the author once again grabs you on page one and doesn't let go until the end.<br /><br />It's not an easy thing to remain relevant over the years with so much competition, but the skills that David displays keeps him above many who have been in the literary run for years. Like fine wine, it seems that ke just keeps getting better.<br /><br />For those die-hard Baldacci fans, this will be one of those that you will long appreciate. For those reading him for the first time, boy are you in for a treat.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I have judged and ridiculed every single Harry Potter film because I have read the books since I was 8, and now here we are at the end. While book 7 is filled with sooo much information, any things left out comprising the first half I think we were able to do without. Obviously movies will not be as good as books, they never are, but this film did a really good job on sticking with the script. After it was over I was pleased and of course sad about Dobby and all of that. It did happen like I imagined it would and overall I think Yates did an exceptional job. As for the actors, Dan, Emma, and Rupert all did extraordinary, and I loved the added scene of Emma in her 'muggle home,' very sad. I loved new people brought in (Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans) and I thought they did great portraying their characters. Obviously this film lacked some action because a lot of it was tying loose ends together, but all the action we will see in this next installment, which will prove the be the saddest and most heart-wrenching of them all. Coming from someone who has reread this final book 7 times, I found it to be complete and explanatory. If you haven't watched the other films recently or only halfheartedly paid attention you might misunderstand or just not understand some things, but if it was all nicely laid out for us and didn't require any thought whatsoever then...well, we'd just call it Twilight. I give this 5 stars and anxiously await the final film to see how this grand finale turns out.
B000P12LWY|5.0|Love this series! It is well made and will suck you right in! I would sit down to watch one episode but not get back up off the couch each night til i finished a whole disk!
B0042KZJ46|4.0|A wonderful and moving performance.  But does anyone else notice the drastic audio quality change on all of disc 2, or is mine just defective?  Disc 1 is a decent stereo monitor mix with good separation.  But from the first track on disc 2 the sound is way over in the right channel and nearly mono, with only an occasional keyboard or percussive sound in the center. I know the last 2 tracks are from an audience tape but it's as if they made all of disc 2 sound bad so the last 2 tracks don't stand out. I have heard bootleg versions that don't have this problem.
B00006DEFA|5.0|As a lover of music and music history,    this is amazing fiction based on the history of music, inventing a powerful story involving WA Mozart and the resent of another.
B003TML0VO|1.0|I'll be quick. Why would anyone even try to re-record and release these songs commercially?  The original versions of these songs are already great! I thought.    But I bought it out of curiosity and because I'm a fan of Carlos' early material so I thought this would be a unique friends project of recording classic hits with a special touch, but after listening over and over for a few times, I could not find anything worthy of ever loading it again on the CD tray.  Mostly anyone can do a decent cover of little Wing, and I ain't superstitious, so we must forgive Carlos for that, but trying to cover songs like: Whole lotta love, Smoke on the water, and Dance the night away, that is unforgivable.
0307454541|4.0|it took me a little while to get into this book; I'd heard very good things in many and varied places so I picked it up and started.  it's a little slow to start, and it's somewhat unusual, I'm sure the translation from Swedish makes for some unusual phrasing but once you get past that (it's about 1/3 of the way through the book), it took off and I didn't even really notice that I'd stayed up till 0300 reading basically the rest of the book.
B000G0O5N2|2.0|I was always curious about this movie based on all the accolades that it received. After seeing it, I'm truly sorry that I did. Discouraging and hopeless was the way it left me. I watched the \\"once great\\" United States get beaten again - as if going through Vietnam was not enough. This person gets shot, that person gets shot, and on and on. Usual Hollywood, shockingly graphic violence. Pointless. Not worth the least bit of my time after all. Yuck.
1402766785|4.0|I got this as a gift.  It was on my Son's wish list and he should really write the review.  But, as a nurse, I can tell you that I was impressed with the anatomy!
0470876417|2.0|I had high hopes for this book, which is billed as a practical, hands-on guide and an antidote to the clunky writing and inflated word count of most business books. The reality is that this book mostly provides a superficial and somewhat arbitrary tour of business concepts. It may be useful to you if you're encountering many of these concepts for the first time, but otherwise you're likely to be underwhelmed. Here, for example, are the book's final words on the matter of sales channels: \\"The trick is to find the right balance between the different types of Channels, to integrate them in a way to create a great customer experience, and to maximize revenues.\\"<br /><br />That is indeed the trick! Does the book offer any insight into how one might pull off this trick, either in terms of specific strategies or compelling case studies? The answer is pretty much: nope. If you've literally never considered how different sales channels affect your business, then the book might provide a useful spark. Otherwise, don't expect to learn anything.<br /><br />The portions of the book that do focus on specific strategies are in some ways worse, because they tend to be overly selective and fadddish. For example, the book devotes a few pages each to exactly five possible patterns for business models: unbundling, long tail, multi-sided platforms, freemium, and open. Perhaps useful as an extremely abbreviated summary of trendy business ideas in the early 2000s, the list seems more likely to lead entrepreneurs astray than yield any true insight.<br /><br />From a practical standpoint, I think it's useful to have a systematic framework through which to analyze and compare business models, and if this book provides such a framework for you, then great. And at least it's a quick read. But don't expect to learn much from the content itself.
B0045HCJFS|5.0|A deranged Muslim terrorist hijacks an American civilian plane with over four hundred passengers. He has a nerve gas on board that can kill a large population. The plane is heading to Washington, DC. A US military commando unit is sent to board the plane while it is flying, make the nerve gas safe, and neutralize the terrorists. The unit had been sent several months earlier on a mission based on bad intelligence and failed. The Secretary of State sends this intelligence man with the unit.<br /><br /> Several things go wrong. There is turbulence during the boarding resulting in the head of the commando unit being killed, the bomb expert paralyzed, and many weapons lost. The commandoes discover that even if they disable the bomb, there is a sleeper terrorist on board who can detonate it with a remote control. It seems almost impossible to disable the intricate bomb, and if they can disable it, find the sleeper agent.<br /><br /> Since the mission seems to have failed, the US president issues an executive decision to destroy the plane and its hundreds of passengers before the plane reaches the US. What will happen?
0439023513|2.0|All three books are brutal in their violence and psychological injury to the characters, but about half way through the final installment becomes dull in its execution. Far too much of the book is focused on lengthy depictions of the lead character's nightmares and delusions. Ultimately, the reader is left with the sense that the surviving characters are too damaged to ever function again and the vague epilogue does little to resolve the impression. A disappointing ending following two excellent volumes.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|J.J. Abrams' reboot of Star Trek was a critical and commercial success, but it did get some bad reviews. One Star Trek fan claimed that the 2009 reboot was \\"too loud\\" and \\"Chris Pine was an irritating James Kirk\\". There's also plot holes and Nero's motivation for killing people was weak. A lot of people die in this Star Trek movie, but most of the killing is done by bad guys. I've been a big Star Trek fan since I was a teenager. I grew disillusioned when Star Trek Nemesis(2002) failed commercially and critically and TV's Star Trek Enterprise(2001-2004) was cancelled! For a few years, the original Star Trek(1966-1969) survived in TV reruns with enhanced CGI VFX. I thought Star Trek was dead and nothing but a memory. Star Trek(2009) does justice to the original Star Trek and it is palatable to non-Trekkers. The film has enough redeeming values, inspired moments, and production value to save it. I was afraid that it would a downbeat, lifeless, train wreck...just like the Battlestar Galactica remake for the SyFy Channel!    The script for the film was written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. These two also wrote scripts for the Transformers movies. Chris Pine takes the William Shatner role of James Kirk and makes it his own. Pine's mother, actress Gwynne Gilford, was in the 1972 horror-comedy Beware! The Blob. Zachary Quinto was good as a young version of Spock and Karl Urban gives a sincere performance as Dr. McCoy. This film is a prequel, yet it's packed with references to past Star Trek adventures. The scene where Spock is picked on by Vulcan boys is a reference to Filmmation's Star Trek cartoon(1973-1974). Michael Giacchino(Ratatouille, Speed Racer) wrote a solid, epic, sweeping, loud music score.  Star Trek(2009) was like a large cake that was successfully baked and neatly decorated. Are we going to be blessed with more Star Trek adventures on TV and cinema? Time will tell. Live long and prosper!
0891419063|5.0|This is a well written, contemplative review of the personal experiences of a WWII marine who participated in many of the most significant campaigns in the Pacific Theater. It is not the \\"grand strategy\\" of the commanders of large forces on the ground, at sea or in the air. It is a personal account of what an individual marine endured as those plans and strategies were carried out. A great read written by a man who was part of the \\"greatest generation\\" with some clue as to how he and his comrades were irrevocably changed by their experiences.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|This story-loosely based on the memoir of how the  writer: Nicole Conn & Producer: Marina Bader came to know each other is undeniably one of the best narratives of love, soulemetry, taking risks, and being true to thine-self, despite the current vernacular norm.     The lead actress: Traci Dinwiddie is absolutely drop dead gorgeous, and she plays her emotionally charged filled character-Peyton Lombard-a lesbian book writer, with such breadth & depth.     After seeing the film, I was completely astonished to learn that it was shot in 12 days, and the 3:24sec. of kissing between Elena & Peyton is not only the longest cinematic kiss in history-it is the hottest kiss on film! Not to mention, Traci and Necar have hot, sizzling chemistry on screen, and they are both great actresses-nothing \\"corny\\" here.     This is truly a must-see, and a must-see again & again.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book takes hold of you and does NOT let go! You have to know how Jack's story ends... It definitely takes several pages to get used to Jack's \\"vocabulary\\", but you quickly do... I longed to know what happened, and now I am longing for it to continue. I am very sad that it ended. Emma Donoghue is a vary talented woman. I recommend this book to all!
0385335997|3.0|Voyager picks up right where Dragonfly left off, and I won't give any details away, but I will say that the immediate drama and action is still there - it's just not as ... immediate and dramatic.  Blame this on the fact that the main characters still don't seem to have very many flaws and don't ever really do anything wrong - and so nothing really new ever happens to them?  Plus the addition of new characters doesn't help much when they aren't treated with nearly as much character development and description as the 2 main characters are.<br /><br />The main reason I'm still reading the Outlander series is admittedly because Gabaldon did such a bang-up job on the first one.  Unfortunately (for me, at least) the steam of the original romance has already run out, and so has the sense of real danger and the what-would-you-do fantasy that kept us guessing through Outlander and Dragonfly.  I really hope this is just a lull in the scheme of things, and I still plan to pick up Drums of Autumn, in hopes of some real turning points in the story.  Voyager did end with a good cliffhanger, and in some form I do very much care about Claire and Jamie's adventures, mostly because of Outlander, but there's a reason it took me a longer time get through this third one.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Great watch at a great price! Some reviewers may have expressed a dislike for the strap quality. I think its pretty durable and unlikely to cause problems anytime soon.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber has taken advantage of his brilliant success, the enduring PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and has created a sequel LOVE NEVER DIES.  Having never seen the stage production may be a disadvantage to appreciating this CD set of the music - there was so mach magic in the special effects of the original PHANTOM that helped it soar.  This 'sequel' takes place on Coney Island and most of the characters from the Parisian theater story have followed the Phantom across the Atlantic.  The story behind the play sounds interesting but it probably is best seen first.<br /><br />The glory of this music is the continuing fine composing of Andrew Lloyd Webber.  The songs still soar, the comedy still dances, the emotions again are airborne. Much of this is due to the performance of the strikingly handsome Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom, the Iranian-born Canadian singer/actor who has been performing the original Phantom for years now.  He voice is very big, very wide in range and very beautiful.  He makes 'Till I Hear You Sing' the show stopper. The pivotal role of Christine is in the sure hands of the excellent Sierra Boggess, Joseph Millson sings Raoul, Liz Robertson inhabits the role of Madame Giry and Summer Strallen sings Meg Giry.  The orchestra and chorus are first rate and are recorded with a fine sense of presence.  One wonders if LOVE NEVER DIES will become as popular as the PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, but with a cast this fine and with a throng of Phantom lovers, the chances are very good that it will make it to our stages soon.  As a recording of beautiful music this set will satisfy lovers of musical theater.  Grady Harp, February 11
B003UBTX7C|1.0|I want to start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Baldacci. I read (and have read) everything he's released.  However, this book was incredibly awful. It was like I was reading a 4th or 5th draft of the book. I kept getting mad and putting it down because it was so bad. Then picking it back up because I didn't want to waste $12.99(!!).  It never got better.  It was so bad it just didn't make sense. I couldn't imagine that an editor had read this and signed off on it.  Heed the bad reviews and PLEASE don't waste your money. Next time I will read the sample before I purchase any more of his books.
030726999X|5.0|This is the third and last installment of Larsson's Millenium trilogy. It is as good -as great, if I may say- as the previous two pieces. If you've read and enjoyed them, you will not be disappointed. It is important to notice that The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is basically a continuation to The Girl Who Played with Fire. These two books make one story together, whereas The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is more independent (though earlier in the trilogy timeline, and thus, better if you read it first).<br /><br />I emphasize another difference between the 3 books. The first two books have many elements of \\"who killed who\\" mystery stories, where some secrets are revealed by the end of the book. The third one has less of that, and it is more a story that is carefully built to reach its climax at the end, but with less \\"mysteries\\". However, this does not affect at all the readability of the piece. It is as much a page-turner as the first two.<br /><br />Have a good read!
1401323820|5.0|If you love well written murder mystery crime procedurals this is for you. I was pleasantly surprized at the high quality writing of this - as I didn't expect much from a tv series merchandise/tie in novel. For people who aren't Castle fans you can easily follow along with the gripping story. Castle fans, there are scenes and lines that are obviously inspired from Richard Castle's experiences on his ride along with Kate Beckett. I love trying to remember/place which episode of Castle has inspired a particular scene or line. Highly recommended!
B0026NWBY2|4.0|If I only have one complaint about this album is this: it should have included a second disc. One disc does no justice to the music of George.
B000JFXTHC|5.0|By description, the box sounded like something kinda cool for a gift.  When I received it, my mouth fell to the floor!<br /><br />The box is in the shape of a book and with a velvety red cover all over.  I opened it started leafing through the pages of its book and ended up reading the whole thing.  The words and stories are so beautiful.  I truly think Enya is a genius!  I was really awe-struck by this book.  I inserted the CD reviewed the stories that went with each song.  Such a talent!  Her voice really is a gift for us.  Geez, I'm getting some CD's of hers for my own!  I've been missing out!  I've heard celtic music but this is exceptional.<br /><br />Just talked to a friend and she said Amarantine was one of her best, next to Memory of Trees.  She's a musician in an orchestra so I'll take her word for it.<br /><br />You will love this box set.  Gorgeous, elegant, heavenly, and a treat for your soul.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I get excited when I stumble upon an artist who knows music, really knows it and respects the beautiful and powerful possibilities of melody and accompaniment. I glossed over Florence + the Machine for a long time because, well, their name sounded similar of course to other indie groups who had failed me over the years. But they are a true revelation.<br /><br />What is special about this album is that the quality of the songs doesn't deteriorate as we get into the latter tracks. We all can agree that that is just about never the case with the average album. I've always hated the way albums are front-loaded, but there is none of that here. There is phenomenal use of percussion but most especially thumping, tribal-esque drums throughout, in exhilerating, inventive rhythmic patterns. The harpist adds even greater depth to the overall soundscape, and he really does play his fingers off. Its inclusion reminds me of Joanna Newsom, but also Jump, Little Children and how well they utilized their cellist.<br /><br />&#34;Dog Days Are Over&#34; is the perfect way to start an album, with bright but meaningful music, modernized 60s pop in the tradition of Nicole Atkins. The fourth track &#34;Howl&#34; is sonically similar to some songs from the 80s, specifically &#34;Silent Running&#34; by Mike and the Mechanics (the accompaniment in the chorus is actually a pretty awesome approximation of it). &#34;Kiss With a Fist&#34; makes me think of something the Ting Tings might record, and &#34;Girl With One Eye&#34; is a great torch song; when Florence Welch starts wailing toward the end and the drums are pounding, it's thrilling.<br /><br />None of this is to say that F+TM are merely imitators; really, in this day and age, they're the furthest thing from it. But what's exciting about the music is that it is familiar in excellent ways and then is still more unique and compelling. That is an extremely hard feat to pull off.<br /><br />I think &#34;Between Two Lungs&#34; might be the song of the album, and my favorite. This is the other &#34;modern 60s pop&#34; song on the album. It takes its time establishing the groove, with ethereal vocals in the background, and it's here that you really notice what a grasp of melody Florence really has as a songwriter. When the song opens up around the 3:15 mark, it just hits me every time that it is perfect music I am listening to. Her voice is beautifully unbridled and everything just 'makes sense.' I so wish this song were longer.<br /><br />In &#34;Blinding&#34; the percussion in the chorus gives me chills, and the harmonic structure takes an unexpected turn right in the middle. It's like every single song has been constructed a layer at a time, and this is why you listen again and again - your mind wants to grasp it all while still fully enjoying it.<br /><br />I've seen lots of adjectives attached to F+TM's overall sound: epic, huge, majestic. And they are all correct. This is the kind of stuff you want to hear performed in an amphitheater - no, a canyon. You want it to fill every single molecule of air around you; you want it to be your skin. You want it to make you better. People should strive to fill their lives only with things that make them feel this way, and thanks to true artists like Florence + the Machine, it gets a little easier to do.ng of the album, and my favorite.

I'm in my 50's and this woman reminds me of what I was like at her age.  She's going to go far with her talent!  Buy this people, you'll love her voice.  Oh and by the way, I wish I could suspend myself on a rope and do stunts.  You'll love her concerts too!  YOU GO GIRL!

0140620303|4.0|I am on a quest to read classic literature. Frankenstein wasn't at the top of my list, or even near the top probably, but my best friend continued to encourage me to read it as it is one of her very favorite books.<br /><br />Frankenstein: Or, The Modern Prometheus (Penguin Classics)<br /><br />This classic book has inspired no fewer than fifty films. It definitely has a firm place in classic literature and in culture. I had no idea that Mary Shelley was the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley. They married when she was age 18/19 years old, in 1816. It was upon a dare, by Lord Byron, to write a ghost story, that Mary Shelley wrote the novel. I like that she didnt just write a \\"ghost story\\" and developed a plot-line like no other before.<br /><br />The review I am in the midst of writing, here, is going to be a mixed bag. I must say that I was quite surprised that the story was written in such a way that it was not difficult for me to finish; not a drudgery as I read it. I somehow felt compelled to read it. I suppose I would say that her writing style is very agreeable. The story is written in the form of a person retelling the story he has been told, in letter form, to a far-off loved one. Writing a story in this manner required an additional back-story. Shelley gave this story the same attention to depth as she gave the main one. I like that; so many of today's authors just do not write in this manner.<br /><br />Overall, however, I do have issues with the story. The premise of the story is that Dr. Victor Frankenstein is on a quest to create life. I think that in order to indulge the story one must suspend reality and choose to believe that man can create life, even in the late 1700s. Done. I do, however take great issue with the fact that in the story Dr. Frankenstein has finally succeeded in creating life when, all of a sudden, he looks at the creature he has created and, aghast, decides he has created something too hideous to allow it to be. Does he destroy it though? Nope; that would end the story. He allows it to remain \\"alive\\" and falls asleep. This of course, comes back to haunt him. The monster leaves, unhindered.<br /><br />Frankenstein learns language and the ability to read through watching a small family without their knowledge. I enjoyed this part of the story. He views them with great longing. His only wish is for communion. Human communtion? Why, he isn't human. But at the very least, human communion would provide him with some form of relationship, his deepest desire. Even his own creator chose not to commune with him. One of the characters from this portion of the book is blind and that gives the \\"monster\\" an opprotunity to speak with him, hoping that he can gain favor with him and then with the rest of his family. This character quickly recognizes the \\"monster's\\" true circumstances and it is summed up well in his words here:<br /><br />\\"Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.\\" Pg 91<br /><br />The next part of the story with which I take issue is that Frankenstein sets off on a long trek and somehow ends up in Geneva and on the property of the Frankensteins without any stated assistance in finding it. That's a bit neat, isn't it? Pretty unbelieavable; there again, it allows for the progression of the story.<br /><br />When the \\"monster\\" finally has an opportunity to speak with Frankenstein he says this:<br /><br />\\"God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image' but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am slitary and abhorred.\\" Pg 88<br /><br />He pleads with Frankenstein to create a female for him, one as equally hideous as he, as a mate with whom he can share love and life. He wants only to be accepted and have a person whom he can accept. Love...isn't that the desire of all people? And wasn't he created in the image of humanity? He offers that they will go live in the farthest reaches of the north where they will bother and be bothered by no one.<br /><br />\\"It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another.\\" Ppg 98<br /><br />\\"Let me see that I excite the of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!\\" Pg 99<br /><br />Frankenstein's monster is so adamant of his need for a mate that he threatens to take vengeance upon Frankenstein if he does not concede to his request/demand. At once Frankenstein agrees that he will create a mate for him; the story progresses a bit, and, voila, Frankenstein rethinks his impulsive decision and determines he will not create another being. Queue the scary music. The monster vowed vengeance if a mate is not created for him; he followed him from Ingolstadt to Geneva; can engeance not be imagined by Frankenstein at this point?<br /><br />Vengeance...it arrives. There is death, and more death. Eventually, Frankenstein ends up chasing the monster to far reaches of the north. Did I say \\"vengeance\\". It doesn't take a lot to figure out what happens next does it?<br /><br />It's easy for me to pick away at the threads of a story. I am not a writer, am I? And so, I feel it would be unfair for me to do so without also finding praise where it is worthy. As I said, the story was compellingly written. I did not avoid or put off reading it once I began. I am glad I read it.<br /><br />And the premise...the creation of life by man. What a premise! It is one that only has greater implications today; perhaps moreso than Shelley could have ever even imagined. She wrote this stunningly well for it to have been written in the early 1800s.<br /><br />What if man could create life? Just because one can do something it does not mean it is something that should be done. Truly, I only believe that God can create life, eternal life, life with a soul. Science has been used by man, to do many things that have direct connections to life. Transplants are just one of those things; there is also research in the lab, on the cellular level. Scary stuff. Yes, the result of some of these things can be great good; it can also be great devastation, as this novel, in great foresight, warns.<br /><br />My husband and I had an interesting conversation with regard to all of this. Frankenstein initially was only sorry he created the \\"monster\\" because of its hideousness. Really? Isn't that fantastic?! He was sorry he created something so ugly! That begs the question that my husband raised: \\"If you could create aesthetically pleasing, beautiful life, would it then be okay to do so?\\" I hardly think so. And that is wherein lies much of the inherent beauty of this novel; it causes great thought.<br /><br />Some of my favorite lines from the book are:<br /><br />\\"A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a tranistory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not be enslaed, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\\" Pg 32<br /><br />\\"Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live.\\" Pg 133<br /><br />It's only been days since I finished reading the novel. While it was still very fresh in my mind I wished to watch a well acclaimed movie version of it. I watched 1994's release \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\\" starring: Robert DeNiro, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hulce, Helena Bonham Carter. A bit of artistic license was taken with the story but not so much that the essence of the story was changed. In fact, I feel that it played out quite well. I was afriad it would be way too gory for me. It had its moments but I think it was handled well given the subject and necessity of including a certain amount of gore. The cultural significance of Frankenstein does not end with the questions it brings up. Immediately after watching the film our children and I were turned on an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show and who was mentioned? Frankenstein.he lab, on the cellular level. Scary stuff. Yes, the result of some of these things can be great good; it can also be great devastation, as this novel, in great foresight, warns.    My husband and I had an interesting conversation with regard to all of this. Frankenstein initially was only sorry he created the \\"monster\\" because of its hideousness. Really?

I watched 1994's release \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\\" starring: Robert DeNiro, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hulce, Helena Bonham Carter. A bit of artistic license was taken with the story but not so much that the essence of the story was changed. In fact, I feel that it played out quite well. I was afriad it would be way too gory for me. It had its moments but I think it was handled well given the subject and necessity of including a certain amount of gore. The cultural significance of Frankenstein does not end with the questions it brings up. Immediately after watching the film our children and I were turned on an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show and who was mentioned? Frankenstein.
0307454541|5.0|I'm normally not one to jump on the bandwagon of popular fiction. I enjoy a well-written book, but I've been disappointed many times by what has become famous on best-selling lists. Therefore, I was apprehensive about Stieg Larsson's blockbuster \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", but this novel surprised me with how absolutely fantastic it was.<br /><br />The plot of the first of three novels by Larsson revolves around Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist who has recently been sentenced to prison for libel concerning an article he wrote about Swedish business magnate Hans-Erik Wennerstr&ouml;m. With his magazine, \\"Millennium\\", facing ruin and his career and credibility in shambles, Blomkvist receives a phone call from a lawyer named Dirch Frode. Frode works for retired industrialist Henrik Vanger, and the 82-year old businessman has a proposal for Mikael. Thirty-seven years ago, during a family meeting on an island in Hedestad, Vanger's great-niece, Harriet, disappeared mysteriously and has not been heard from since. Due to an accident on the bridge leading to the island, Henrik has narrowed down the possibilities to one: Harriet was murdered. Because of the accident, there are a limited number of suspects, and all of them are members of his family. He wants to hire Blomkvist to write his autobiography, a cover story for investigating Harriet's disappearance.<br /><br />Realistically, Mikael doesn't expect to find much. The disappearance was investigated thoroughly when it occurred in 1966, and both Henrik and the investigating detective have continued their inquiries since. But when one revelation leads to another, Blomkvist realizes that he is onto something. With the help of an asocial investigator named Lisbeth Salander, he may be able to uncover the truth - if he doesn't end up dead first.<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" has all the elements of a great novel - crime, passion, greed, murder, fraud, deception, revenge, jealousy, and hidden secrets. What makes it perfect is that it is woven together into a fantastic story involving protagonists you can't help but root for. In this case, the hype over the novel is well-deserved. I can't wait to delve into the next one.woven together into a fantastic story involving protagonists you can't help but root for. In this case, the hype over the novel is well-deserved.

B0036S4CTS|5.0|This is a book about growing up and how that changes the relationships you have with those around you.  It follows a man and a woman from college up through the rest of their lives in a very intimate way.  Each chapter is one day in their lives and is done so with such fluidness.  You realize just how much one day four years ago matters for this day four years later.  It's an amazing book.  It's interesting too because I found myself rooting for one character in their earlier years and being annoyed by the other and this completely switched halfway through their lives.  A good book, for sure.
B003MOHX8S|3.0|Well, I liked it, I can even recommend it. I believe these guys do a very good job.    However, I felt a lack of art, a lack of subtlety, a lack of equilibrium.   It's too Hollywood, too commercial, too \\"lets stick to the formula that works for us every single time\\".    There were no real risks taken, no edgy creativity, no steps up on all the trailer music we like and already heard a thousand times.     Actually, I have downloaded a couple of trailer music CD's, and I can't tell the difference between them.    I guess that my point is made. The rest is already written in the other many reviews.

Even though I was alive during the time of the incidents, I hadn't realized how primitive medical knowledge and care was compared with today.

B002VUFKG6|5.0|I'm convinced this is a must read for those about to make a big step down the isle.  This was not at all like this first book; however, it was must more introspective in some ways and extremely educational.  You have to walk into it knowing that Elizabeth Gilbert wasn't interested in marriage so if you know where she's coming from you can take some of what she says a little easier.  However, it also opens up your eyes to really and truly getting to know your partner and all the reasons marriages fail.  Gilbert also explores why marriages succeed too.  It's a slow-er read; however, it's really a great read for those who are newly engaged.  (Although, I'm not sure I'd give it as a present unless you're the mom or a very, very close Aunt.)

030746363X|1.0|This book is full of foul language which is completely unnecessary. After many pages of trying to look past the offensive language, I'm done and returning the book. I don't care how good the material is, I expect a professional approach. If this is a researched and professional work, it should be presented in a professional manner. Doesn't have to be formal and dry, but at least not locker room tone.<br /><br />Also, this is a large book with in-depth and diverging topics. I wanted something to the point and clear about diet and exercise. I don't want to read through lots of stories and anecdotes and then go back and review to figure out what I'm supposed to do. I don't have time for a 560 page book about everything.
0811876373|4.0|I was very excited when I discovered this book!  What a great idea, \\"Cake Pops\\".  Since I love to make favors and decorations for showers and parties, I couldn't wait to give these a try.  The book is well written and laid out.  I just love all the different ways to make such cute \\"Pops\\".  However, I've tried to make the cake balls twice and they didn't come out as smoothly coated as the ones in the book.  My coating was to thick to cover cake completely smooth.  It did say to add some crystals to the dipping chocolate, but I was unable to find that in my local Michaels Store, so I used vegetable oil...but still couldn't achieve the same results.  Guess it just takes practice, practice, practice...but my kids ate them up anyway and absolutely loved them.  They thought I was the most creative Mom!    Thanks Bakerella for putting smiles on their faces!
1936594242|4.0|Author of[[ASIN:0473149524 Aztec Dawn: A tale of sacrifical murder, from Manhattan to Mexico]]  and [[ASIN:0473125382 Afinidad: A novel of a serial killer]]<br />This book, together with Eckhart Tolle's 'The Power of Now', has really made me feel as though I now have a complete understanding of where I fit in the grand scheme of things and how I can best live a happy life. That's one hell of a statement to make! And it's not to say that I will be terribly successful at so living, but these two authors have given me the knowledge needed; it's up to me to now put it into practice.<br />Charles F Haanel, writing in the early 1900s, was so utterly convinced of his message that his book is very inspiring. He tells us with complete conviction that we are not separate from the power and the creative energy that gave birth to all that is; we are a part of it. He implores us to recognize this so that we can realize that our lives are truly under our control by virtue of the thoughts we have and the feelings that they generate. This is exactly what Tolle says also, only Haanel is interested in using this knowledge to mould our lives to get what we want in a material sense. Tolle stops short of that, limiting his teaching to how we will achieve peace in life by fully accepting what is. Such total acceptance does, however, dovetail with Haanel's message because, if one is fighting and hating what is actually going on at any given time, you are sending out the energy for more of the same (the law of attraction). We are beings whose link with the creative energy that gave birth to the world is our thoughts. Haanel goes into great detail about how to train our minds so that we will think only constructive thoughts that lead to positive feelings that will lead to favorable outcomes in our lives. He uses the concepts of visualisations and affirmations, and here was I thinking that those were modern ideas! Haanel, who belonged to the American Scientic League, claims that his message is empirically proven and, certainly, his book is the most logical take on this subject that I have ever read. That is why I found it so encouraging. Highly recommended for anyone needing to go a little further in their search for answers to the meaning of life and all that stuff.<br />P.S. I stopped short of giving it 5 stars because Haanel does repeat himself a lot. I didn't mind that personally as I need all the encouragement I can get at this point in my life, but it can get tedious.<br />like  flagrically proven and, certainly, his book is the most logical take on this subject that I have ever read.

B003V5PQ1E|5.0|I bought the clean version (after listening to my sisters copy of the regular album). I understand freedom of expression and although I think 'Robot Boy' should win some kind of award for the catchiest use of the 'F' word is rock song I can't help but wonder if the language is really necessary. One of the things that drew me to Linkin Park was the lack of coarse language on their first two albums. By the way, whoever editted the album missed some language at the end of 'Robot Boy' as the song fades out...<br />Anyway, all that said, the album is amazing, full of art, emotion, intensity and pathos. Pure genius. Long live the 'Park!
B000002N3N|4.0|Enya is distinctive in her genre.  Much perseveration but that seems intrinsic to the style.  Better half is sleeve-pullingly proud of her Irish ancestry and Enya is now integral to all that, but one does not replay Enya's CDs constantly as the perseveration can be mind-numbing.
B001E45XT4|4.0|Had these for a few weeks, and they seem very good for the price.  They are remarkably comfortable, with generous firm padding on the earcups and connecting piece to ensure a comfortable fit.  The padding seems to drown exterior noise pretty well.    The sound quality is adequate, if not mindblowing.  Not much bass, but otherwise okay for basic gaming use.  Some players online have said that the mic sounds really weak to them.  I tested the mic myself and it sounded okay to me, but this may be an issue.  My one real complaint is that the mic/headphone jacks aren't differently colored.  You have to look up close at the logos to tell which jack is which.  Of course you can mark it yourself to make this easier, but how much more expensive would it be to throw in a bit of red plastic?  This should have been a no-brainer.    Overall a good gaming headset for gamers on a budget.
1591840562|5.0|I got interested in this book because of Kawasaki's Apple connection. I heard the audio version.    While Kawasaki pitches this book at aspiring start-ups, I think there are takeaways for just about everyone. For example, everyone--not just start-ups--should follow the 10-20-30 rule at ANY presentation. And why should it take any firm--small or big--longer than 10 seconds to own responsibility for a task? If only the CEOs and managers of larger firms care to listen, they can apply many common-sense principles from this book to presentation, hiring, and operations. And even aspiring job candidates can learn how to pitch themselves better. I thoroughly recommend this book.
0142000671|5.0|I cannot remember the last time, if ever, a story and its characters brought me to tears.  This is what great story-telling is all about.    The narrative get darker and more intense as the story progresses, until you realize that despite your most fervent and desperate hopes, the looming clouds are going to wash away dreams that one almost dare not cherish.  The sad ending does not douse all optimism, however, and ends on a note of giving one's dreams, however amended, another chance.    Also, to echo what may already have been stated already, the audio narration by Gary Sinise is absolutely top notch.
1400064287|5.0|I listened to the audio version of this riveting and entertaining book, and I was sad that the 7th CD came to an end!    What makes this book so great is that there are plenty of examples, making it very practical. Given our jaded ways of thinking as we get entrenched in the daily grind, these examples come as a breath of fresh air. The Nora Ephron anecdote is simply unforgettable.    I'm amazed at the amount of research the Heath brothers have conducted, in order to compile these contextual examples. If I could assign more than 5 stars to this book, I'd do it!
1592332803|5.0|I should say that I am not (yet?) vegan.  I am allergic to eggs, though, and I keep dairy usage to a minimum, so this book has been great for me.    I love this cookbook for exactly the reason that some others hate it--it uses \\"normal\\" ingredients to make vegan goods.  I do have soymilk, flour, and vinegar on hand.  I do not have ground flaxseed or walnut flour just sitting in my kitchen.  I am all for making extremely healthy baked goods with more eccentric ingredients, but that requires planning and sometimes I just want to make my family muffins on Sunday morning without running out to Whole Foods or the market.  This book lets me do that by making vegan cooking easy and familiar.  I also like that the final product tastes familiar to others.  They are amazed at how like \\"normal\\" muffins, or cakes, or whatever these foods are.  This demystifies life without eggs, dairy, etc...  And, that is a good thing for all of us who are working toward being conscious of others' suffering.  I love this book.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|I tried most of the mouse controllers including FragFX and Fragnstein, Eagle Eye is the closest to PC gaming as it can get. Eagle eye has the least lag and with  X, Y, deadzone and sensitivity adjustments it's not really a factor in most games I played, MAG, COD and MGS4. I use wireless set up with G700 and Microsoft Arc keyboard. Make sure you do your research 'cause not all keyboards and mice are compatible and you won't be able to program in Windows 64 bit system. One down side is that it only stores 2 keymaps unlike others whick have X, square, triangle, and circle keys so do not need to program.
0307266303|5.0|Christopher McDougall weaves together many stories, theories, people and events into this text that centers around the Tarahumara people of Mexico and the ultimate ultra running race. I'm personally a runner, so this book was a fantastic read for me.<br /><br />Why So Great:<br />- First of all, I read it the week before I ran a half marathon for some motivation, which was great. I remember thinking somewhere around mile 8 that if ultrarunners can tackle 100 miles I can stick out five more.<br />- It wasn't just about running; it was about people, science, struggles, and how people find unique ways to problem solve.<br />- It explains a lot of the rationale behind this \\"barefoot running\\" craze the industry is currently seeing.<br />- McDougall writes well, doing a great job of staying on track while taking quick, relevant detours.<br /><br />Be Weary<br />- If you're not a runner you may not love it, although you actually may. Heck, it may inspire you to buy some Brooks.<br />- There is a lot of data presented in this book to support barefoot running, but it definitely isn't a guide. I over-pronate, have flat feet and a semi-deformed ankle- there is not way I'm heading out without my shoes. If I had started running barefoot in high school, maybe this would be for me. Just make sure you do other research besides this book if you're considering purchasing some Vibrams.<br />- McDougall does get off track often- I enjoyed his tangents, but if you're reading purely for the final race, be prepared for some side missions.<br /><br />Very interesting and extremely motivating.

B004I65D0O|4.0|Despite all the raves listed previously about how this is Prince's latest (and perhaps last) album, \\"Come\\" fails to qualify as Prince's most recent project to anyone who has followed the Purple One. The album was originally recorded in 1993, at the same time he was working on The Gold Experience. Warner Bros. accepted both albums, but refused to release them both at the same time fearing the market would have too much Prince material in stock. The original version of Come actually contained 4 additional tracks not seen in this version comprising remixes and instrumental versions of some of the previous tracks. Upon release, Come received little support from Prince, who derided the album as \\"old material\\", despite the fact that many of the tracks had been recorded during the same sessions that produced The Gold Experience. Since Prince placed the more up-tempo and commercial material from these sessions on The Gold Experience.     That said, it still represents a brilliant, if darker, representation of the inner workings of this strange musical mind. It will make you wet with it's sultry sexual dirty filthy tantric lyrics.    This album also represents a pivotal period of Prince's history. The original album cover depicted \\"Prince: 1958-1993\\", indicating that Prince had \\"died\\" in 1993 and would soon be reborn under his Love Symbol alias.

Everything was fine until three-quarters of the way through.  Then it was unable to play.  Upon closer inspection, there were holes that went through the case and into the disk.

0385341679|3.0|So, we've reached the end...or have we?  I found Shadowfever to be so convoluted and confusing it left me with more questions than answers.  I was so excited when Shadowfever was published.  I planned to read it cover to cover.  Instead I had to put it down several times and come back to it later because it kept giving me a headache. While I love KMM's other books and I've eagerly awaited Shadowfever, this book is not what I've been waiting for.  I loved the cover and was so excited when I saw the thickness of this book.  I thought, \\"Yay!  We get extra!\\"  Unfortunately I could have done without it.   There was too much endless introspection and not enough action and interaction between the main characters.  3/4 of the book was just Mac, talking to herself in her head, questioning everything and everyone and herself endlessly.  I felt little connection between Mac and the other characters.  Instead of showing us through her actions, Mac just told us how she was feeling most of the time.  She remained very detached.  This was Mac's personal journey to try to discover who and what she was, what she was capable of doing, and how to bring an end to it all.  I wanted more between Mac and Barrons.  Their resolution was rather anticlimactic.  This time they never tugged on my heartstrings.  I never felt like jumping to my feet and cheering for the home team.  The full cast scenes of endless arguments and bickering seemed beneath all who were involved.  I was left with so many questions.  If you have never read a book by KMM, this is not the one to start with.

B00005JLEU|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you are in for a treat. It transports you into a magical world created by world class animators. The story is simple: a little girl is lost in a magical land and it takes courage for her to rescue her parents and return. But that's not the most important part. The strength of the movie is in the breathtaking animation, scenery, and music. If you haven't been to Japan, you'll want to after seeing this movie. If you have children, they will especially enjoy visiting the Studio Ghibli museum near Tokyo. This movie is Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece, in my opinion.

This was the first time I've ever really watched a blu ray disc, and the first time I've done so on my nearly 3 year old LCD TV.  I haven't seen B&TB since it first came out on VHS back in 1992, but it looked and sounded like it was just drawn and recorded yesterday.  The images were so vivid and clear that at times it almost seemed as though it was 3-D.  The sound was also updated with great care (very important for a musical), and with our new 5.1 system, the movie was just as much theatrical experience as it must have been in the theater.  For anyone looking to show just how gorgeous animation looks on blu ray, this is a must-own!

B003Q6D1YW|4.0|Catfish is an interesting documentary that explores the meaning of identity in cyberspace. In Catfish, Manhattan photographer Nev Schulman learns of an 8-year-old from Michigan named Abby who shows prodigious talent for painting. Nev begins to correspond online with Abby and with her 19-year-old sister, Megan. Soon, Nev is in love with Megan.    As the relationships progress, Nev's friends film him as he interacts with Megan and Abby by phone and email. Eventually, however, Nev realizes that Meg is lying to him. To get to the bottom of the mystery, Nev and his friends fly to Chicago and take a road trip to Abby and Megan's homes on Michigan's remote upper peninsula. Once they arrive, the three men are in for many more surprises.    Catfish has several great aspects that \\"hook\\" the viewer. On one level, the film is a mystery that the viewer cannot wait to unravel. On another - more important - level, Catfish makes a subtle point about not judging people until we fully understand their circumstances. The filmmakers deserve credit for not \\"dumbing down\\" a complex story or telling the viewer what to think. Similarly, Catfish explores how truth can be slippery.    I have but one criticism of Catfish - another documentary already explored the ramifications of re-inventing ourselves online. That film - talhotblond - is just a bit better than Catfish because its story is better. In talhotblond the conclusion is much stronger. By contrast, Catfish just sort of meanders to a close.    Catfish is a very good documentary. I recommend it, but I'd watch talhotblond first.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I listen mostly to classical music so quality is essential. These headphines provide excellent quality sound, clarity and even response from low to high notes.<br />The ear pieces also do a good job in cutting out background noise, which is very annoying in the soft or very soft places in the music (especially classical).<br /><br />The ear pieces are a tad small for my large ears. They are soft and smooth, so this is fine for an hour, but after that it becomes a bit uncomfortable.  If you have average-size or small ears, this should not be a problem.<br /><br />For the price, I don't think I could find a better pair of headphones.

0061726826|5.0|Lauren Oliver captured my bookish heart with BEFORE I FALL, and, with DELIRIUM, she's proven that she's more than a one hit wonder and fully capable of slipping from one genre to another without missing a beat.<br /><br />There's something about Oliver's books that pulls me in and makes them near impossible to put down. The writing and plots are always fantastic, but I think it's the characters and their emotion that I find so alluring. There's so much passion in these books, particularly DELIRIUM. There's passion in the carnal sense - the romance is gorgeous - but Lena also possesses a passion for life and love that will speak to any reader.<br /><br />In DELIRIUM, curing deliria, or love, isn't limited to just romantic love, it includes all love. The love between siblings, between a parent and child, and for life itself... What a terribly lonely world Lena is trapped in. There are times when I think  that it would be much easier to not deal with the pain of love, but, after exploring Lena's world, I don't think the benefits of escaping love would ever outweigh the costs. If nothing else, DELIRIUM reminds readers just how lucky they are to know and experience love... even with the heartbreak and pain that travels beside it.<br /><br />Somewhat unsurprisingly, Oliver leaves us hanging at DELIRIUM's close and, at least in my case, guarantees that readers will be scrambling to get their hands on the next installment.

To have been there I can only of course wish, but I came to Marley and his works only later or at just about that time.<br /><br />This is a historical document, and one cannot expect album-release quality in the capture or strategically placed mikes, etc. I see there are complainers amongst the reviews and find it sad that even being given the fortuitous chance, at last, to hear this \\"farewell\\" from Marley and the Wailers, that they cannot overlook the  deficiencies present here. I am a collector of many rare old recordings of live performances (usually classical or opera) and have accustomed myself to \\"not the best sound wise\\" for the sheer thrill and pleasure of being able to hear these old performances by many long gone talents and so I perhaps have an \\"up\\" over these folks. Regardless, this is an amazing night, luckily captured (yes with some problems), but now being passed over to us through the medium that we may in some cases \\"re-live\\" the night (if you were there), or to \\"at last\\" hear this final bow from the greatest Reggae Master of all time and who's influence is still being felt on and in our music today.<br /><br />If you're a Marley fan, you of course must have this album. If not, and you like reggae, you still must at least \\"hear\\" this album...even if you borrow a copy, listen to it....one of the great concerts, and now we all may listen to it, luckily.

B0049OSQ18|5.0|An Exceptional Discovery for me is this knockout album by the Decemberists, discovered by accident here on Amazon!<br /><br />My long background in graphics and photography, etc., has honed my eye to pick up on many things instantly, in this instance the excellent cover photograph and artwork on this album. So, having caught my eye, I went to the page for information on who they are, and what their background was, and discovered there were links to soundbites, and of course, was immediately taken in by these guys, returning many times in the past week to \\"sample again\\"!<br /><br />Yesterday I finally went to my local music shop and bought it and have been listening to it over the course of the day and evening, and am tickled (at the ripe older age of 63) to have found a new group!!! My usual genre for music these days is classical, jazz, or oldies (anything before 1990 all the way back to infinitum for the recording industry), and so this should give you an idea just how good this album, and this group are!<br /><br />Better still, I find no weak entrys here, or ones seemingly out of place in this group of songs that I would define as rural-country-folky-with a serious tip of the hat to U2, R. E. M., etc., and some new age elements thrown in. The songs are moving and substantial, these musicians and singers are first-rate and deserve your attention for the 40 minutes that they are devoting to your brain through your ears. Time well spent, for sure.<br /><br />Apparently from what I read on the album notes, and have found elsewhere about the Decemberists, this is a new direction for them, a departure from their previous efforts, which I will surely, soon, be investigating...if they're THIS good here, they surely cannot be unworthy of further listening!<br /><br />In short, these guys are NOTEWORTHY and I highly recommend them to you. Give them a listen through the clips here, but be warned, you're gonna want \\"more\\" like I did!<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />~operabruin
0061726826|3.0|Delirium by Lauren Oliver<br />Harper, 2011<br />303 pages<br />3.5/5 stars<br /><br />Source: Uncorrected eproof from Netgalley<br /><br />Summary: People used to think that love was a good thing, not realizing that their headaches, knee pains, strokes, etc were usually caused by love.  Now the situation is better because there's a cure, administered at the age of eighteen.  Lena cannot wait for the cure.  Her mother suffered from love all her life before dying and Lena wants the cure in order to become normal, calm, and dignified.  But just weeks before her scheduled treatment, her best friend starts acting oddly and she meets a boy with whom she actually falls in love.<br /><br />Thoughts: There's been a lot of buzz in the blogosphere about this book and it's obvious why.  Oliver's first book Before I Fall was a critical smash and she continues her beautiful writing in Delirium.  However I was much less pleased with this book.<br /><br />First it turns out that it is supposed to serve as the first book in a trilogy; I had thought it would be a standalone like Before I Fall.  Thus Oliver spends a lot of time creating the world and it is boring.  I kept waiting for something to happen and interest me in the story.  Then things do happen but I was pretty annoyed with Lena by that point.  I did not want to read about how good looking she found Alex, how nervous she was about what she was doing, and my personal breaking point was about halfway through when she sneaked out of the house, supposedly to go warn her friend out about regulators seeking the uncured after curfew.  I didn't believe Lena's rationale that she had to leave and I thought she was a complete idiot for doing so.<br /><br />As the story progresses, it unfolds like many dystopians that I've read with the main character slowly coming to the realization that the government is manipulating people, is doing wrong, etc, etc.  I may be a bit tired of dystopians and am plunging into some more mysteries and contemporary in the foreseeable future.<br /><br />However I do still like Oliver's writing as it's absolutely beautiful, and the ending was very shocking to me.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br />1. Super sad part: Lena comes across a dog that was shot by the regulators and is dying in the street-the saddest part of the book as far as I'm concerned.<br />2. Ending: Alex dies and I'm not sure I want to read the sequels without him in them, even though I did get tired of Lena gushing about his stupid eye color.<br />END SPOILERS<br /><br />Overall: A very slow dystopian that some people might find more rewarding than I did.<br /><br />Cover: I don't like this cover very much; I do think the blue is pretty and the basic concept could be used for all three books but it's not attractive to me.  If I hadn't read Before I Fall or hadn't been a part of the YA blogosphere, I probably would not have read it.do still like Oliver's writing as it's absolutely beautiful, and the ending was very shocking to me.

1595141715|5.0|I know people say this a whole lot but for me this is amazing. I am one of those bookwormies( luv all my homies) and this is amazing to have picked a favorite but with the plot and emotional and real way Asher writes this I cried and I laughed and I symathized for Hannah. What happens to her isn't all that hard to see.    Hannah is depressed and feels all alone. this something evryone can relate to. maybe you had lots of friends and were very happy.But, maybe you were like hannah and had friends, though you never knew it.    I know that this book has helped me to keep some of my friends. One had been considering sucicide but after they read this they had realized what they had in life. They then went to get help and now they are better.   This book is all about a boy named Clay who was in love with a girl named Hannah Baker, who had committed suicide. He recives tapes that tell Hannah's story, and the people that recive these are on of the TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY she did it.   You will cry yyour eyes out when you read this book.

B003L77GH4|5.0|A friend who knows that I love the Twilight and True Blood books and films got me hooked on this show, and I just love it.  It's kind of a cross between the two other series:  it doesn't have the persistent longing and heartbreak (part of the \\"cheese factor,\\" which is fun, but which can be overbearing) that are throughout the Twilight series, and yet isn't as graphic as True Blood.  That being said, it's definitely it's own very unique show.<br /><br />The character development is really fantastic on TVD, and each episode really focuses on drawing out intricacies of each personality.  Also, there are a lot of plot lines to follow and characters that appear and then re-appear, which make for an interesting story arc.  Additionally, the central characters also have a complexity to them that is missing from some other series.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, this show definitely appeals to many age groups and both genders.  I'm in my late 30's and love this show, and know many of my diverse friends like it, too.<br /><br />It's a great show that keeps getting better with each new episode!
B000002GF8|5.0|Police- Synchronicity. That big hit, that Song of the Year, \\"Every Breathe You Take.\\" Don't get it twisted. It's not the ONLY highlight on this album.<br /><br />This mostly mellow album took me on a journey to my distaste, initially, but it grew on me.<br /><br />Highlights on this album, in order, are the phenomonal \\"Sychronicity I,\\" the dinosaur-oriented \\"Walking in Your Footsteps,\\" the deity acrimonious melody \\"O My God,\\" the secure \\"Miss Gradenko,\\" the hit \\"Synchronicity II,\\" the mildly poignant \\"King of Pain,\\" \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger,\\" the picturesque \\"Tea in Sahara,\\" and the hidden gem, \\"Murder by Numbers.\\"<br /><br />Now, for the critics. I didn't necessarily agree with the secular lyrics to \\"O My God.\\" \\"Mother\\" exploits this grating voice from Sting and the lyrics show subtle hostility towards the subject. That's all.<br /><br />Mild flaws with \\"Synchronicity,\\" which came out in 1983. Sonically, most of the songs are enjoyable. 8 out of the 11 songs were written by the lead singer. Spectacular finish to the Police's career. They went out with a bang.

1582701709|1.0|We can all agree positive thinking is essential to any successful life and to any business venture. Positive thinking, however, needs to be married to intelligence, experience, knowledge, common sense and realism, resources, advance planning and awareness of risks - and you have to put in the hard work to succeed. Believing you will be successful if you do none of these things except to think positively and believe in the so-called \\"law of attraction\\" is lazy and simplistic, and won't work.<br /><br />So, not to dance delicately around the issue, all the people who point to Rhonda Byrne's \\"The Secret\\" as a shallow, manipulative marketing scam (which moreover utilises several tried and tested con-tricks to fool the gullible into parting with their money) are probably right. No doubt she is laughing all the way to the bank at the successful exploitation of this clever idea to a sufficient number of suckers to make her fortune. If all that was necessary for success in anything was to \\"understand and use the law of attraction\\" then every sports team would win every tournament, every prisoner would break out of jail, there would be no sick or disabled, no obese people; everyone would be rich - and I'd be married to Keira Knightley.<br /><br />Ultimately, dressing-up the scam with misquotes, pseudoscience and outright lies, and supporting ridiculous claims by anecdote makes it no less transparent, no different from a snake-oil salesman or faith healer. Tell the reader unsupported anecdotes that the blind can regain their sight, the deaf can hear, the lame can walk again, those with cancer will be cured: just believe, and your life will be transformed. If it doesn't happen then it's your fault, ye of little faith: you attract disease and misfortune to yourself by bad thoughts.<br /><br />How naïve does someone need to be in order to buy into trash like \\"...food can't cause you to put on weight, unless you think it can\\"? Worse still (far worse), to even suggest that doctors deliberately keep people sick so they can sell them useless medicine is beyond shameful.<br /><br />So, think again before you click on \\"Add to basket\\" for that copy of \\"The Secret\\" you're planning to buy. Desist, and your credit card bill next month will be a little smaller - proving there are simple techniques to increase your wealth with no effort! Be happy!ople sick so they can sell them useless medicine is beyond shameful.    So, think again before you click on \\"Add to basket\\" for that copy of \\"The Secret\\" you're planning to buy.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I've had this headset for 6 months now and wanted to say I'm absolutely impressed with the quality of the sound, while It's simulated surround sound, please understand that people only have 2 ear drums. with the right processing you can distort sounds to fool the brain into thinking they are coming from multiple directions and therefore i have not noticed any difference between the X41 compared to Astros or Trittons except the X41 tends to have more realistic and deeper bass. The only issue I've had is they seem to run on the same frequency as 802.11n WiFi signals. My fix was to simply move the stand at least a yard from any WiFi antennas or change your computer/router to use only b/g frequencies. No problems since. The X41 eats AAA batteries so make sure to get rechargeable ones or you'll go through a pair ever 10 hrs of game-play. The fact that they are wireless and I can listen to music and do housework while wearing them is a big sell point for me. I would recommend these to a friend.    *4 year update*    4 years now I've owned and used this headset!! I primarily use it for PC gaming now, with a wired 360 controller hooked up for voice chat. I had to replace only the chat cable once, ordered the replacement directly form Turtle Beach. Other then that, still pretty much in perfect condition despite thousands of hours of use. Speaker drivers are still just as crisp as the day i bought them, microphone still works perfect!    With occasional cleaning and care I now feel there's no real reason this headset should ever break! one thing I did have to do was YouTube how to remove the ear cups, but that turned out to be quite simple and they are easy to hand clean with a bit of detergent in the sink once a year!    I don't yet have a reason to buy a newer model since these still work so wonderfully!!    I am really impressed with Turtle Beach. This headset has outlived 3 Xbox 360 controllers, 2 keyboards, 2 pair AAA rechargeable batteries, 1 mouse, and 1 TV! Popped itup to 5 ★s
B003XKAZK4|5.0|I have to first start off by saying that I am happy and pleased with the number of hits that are included in this collection of Robbie William's Hits.  The songs that stood out for me the most are:<br />1)She's the One-A great track on what it feels like to be with someone that is like your twin soul. He recently found true love with US model and actress Ayda Field (Robbie married her at his Los Angeles mansion in the summer of 2010) (I saw a picture of them on a bbc website, they are a cute couple).  The point that I am making is that because he has found true love that the title \\"She's the One\\" has come to be the real-life connection to his great musical art.<br />2)Rock DJ- A great song about having fun, and making the best of your life regardless of where in your journey that you are.<br />3)Millenium- A song that symbolizes taking inventory of where a person is in their life while an abundance of time is available.<br />4)Angels- A beautiful song about enjoying the company of kind people (symbolized by the lyrics I'm loving angels instead).<br />5)Do Me Now- A catchy song about the many fascinating things that he is interested in, but that although he has many interest, that in the now moment it is more important to him to seize the moment and have fun.<br />6)Feel- A beautiful song about experiencing passionate and happy love.  His music video has him playing a rodeo star, and Hannah plays as his love interest.  I love both the video and the song to \\"Feel\\". I admit that I thought that Robbie Willliams looked very handsome in the \\"Feel\\" video. However, his quality lyrics and strong singing expressed in \\"Feel\\" proves that he is much more than just an attractive face(and that Robbie truly has the gift of singing great songs).  \\"Feel\\" by Robbie Williams is one of my favorite songs because it expresses how passion can serve as a positive agent for joyful change in a person's life.<br />7)Bodies- A very sexy song that is tastefully done, and appears to be about striving to make sense of the importance of seeing the beauty in one's body even amidst the societal obsession with having \\"perfect\\" and/or \\"thin\\" bodies.<br /><br />  Getting this three cd set by Robbie Williams was so very worth it because of the number of good songs and his excellent voice.  There is something magnetic and powerful about Robbie William's voice that goes wonderfully with many of this songs.  Please consider getting this collection of Robbie's if you like any of his songs and/or you enjoy pop music. In my humble opinion, Robbie has so much talent and creatively expresses his spirit through his music (it beautifully shows through many of the songs on this three cd set).  I would even dare to say that Robbie deserves alot more attention here in America because of the superb music that he creates, and his powerful singing voice).portance of seeing the beauty in one's body even amidst the societal obsession with having \\"perfect\\" and/or \\"thin\\" bodies.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|This is a very strong compilation from Eminem.  I really feel that Eminem put alot of energy in making sure that listeners get a great musical cd. Yes, many of his finest songs on this cds have some strong language. However, the songs that have the most daring lyrics are some of the best songs.  All of the songs on this Recovery collection are very cutting-edge and daring (in a fun and exciting way). The following five songs stood out for me the most:<br />1)W.T.P: A very naughty but exciting song about having a party involving people having fun.<br />2)Space Bound: A very daring but creative love song about being with someone that you truly have.  Eminem sings with such strong conviction that he really excels at singing daring love songs like this with such lyrics as: you take my breath away, you're a supernova. I really enjoyed hearing the side of him of what it feels like through his perspective of what it means to be in love.  The only caveat I had with this song is that he sings about literally choking the person he loves if she ever thought about leaving him, with the following words: I put both hands on your throat. Yes, I understand that it is just entertainment (also I am sure that Eminem himself does not condone abusing your partners in any form). My husband even playfully joked with me about there being nothing wrong with choking the person you love if they leave you (please understand that my husband was just joking and is actually a sweet person who is very laidback, and does not condone physical or verbal abuse). However, hopefully countless other couples that hear this song are also going to understand that this song is only entertainment and is no way endorsing the act of killing someone who leaves you.<br />3)Cinderella Man- A great song about making comebacks in life, and making the most of second chances that you are given. I also like how he subtly drops the concept of time travel with the lyrics \\"music is my time machine\\".<br />4)Love the Way You Lie- This was a great collaboration that Eminem did with Rihanna (I thought that they had strong chemistry together in this song). The video and the song are both a powerful combination and sends a strong message how love can play a strong influence in the challenge threshold that one is willing to endure for someone that means so much to them.<br />5) So Bad- I admit that this was my favorite song by him.  Yes, this musical track can  pretty much be titled a \\"Bad Boy's Anthem\\". He sings about giving his sexual conquests such good sex that he is going to end up being forever embedded in their memories.  The lyrics are very wild but so much fun that you are going to have to listen to the song in order to see for yourself why this song can safely be titled a \\"Bad Boy's Anthem\\" and/or a \\"Player's Anthem\\". However, I confess that this song was one that I enjoyed so much that it has been played multiple times since I had this cd.<br /><br />  There are other songs on this cd that may appeal more to others. However, to sum it up this cd is very good. After listening to this I definitely plan on tuning into this year's Grammy Awards show because I am rooting for him to win some awards.Eminem has definitely put out an enjoyable album to listen to with \\"Recovery\\".as a great collaboration that Eminem did with Rihanna (I thought that they had strong chemistry together in this song).

B00243FQFA|5.0|[[ASIN:B00243FQFA Stargate Atlantis: The Complete Fifth Season]]<br />Loved this show! Wish they would have kept it going. We cannot stand \\"universe\\". So much<br />more they could have done, specially leaving the wraith as an undefeated threat, not to<br />forget the weird machine/beings from the alternate universe.

B000001EAQ|3.0|Cutting through the b.s. here - \\"Pop\\" is not a techno album, and that is not why it is so rudely criticized and held in contempt by U2 fans.  In fact, the trio of techno-infused songs that open the album (\\"Discotheque\\", \\"Do You Feel Loved\\", and the stomping \\"Mofo\\") are the three best tunes on the CD.  All pulsate with energy and sing-along choruses (okay, maybe not so much \\"Mofo\\", but it still rocks) with Edge's guitars charging in and out of the mix to create some truly interesting aural soundscapes.  It doesn't sound like \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", but you really don't want it to either.    What sinks the album is what immediately comes after that hat trick - a 9-song dullfest, mostly ballads, that just falls flat, with zero dancability and zero rockability.  That's not to say the songs are all bad. \\"Staring At The Sun\\" and \\"Gone\\" are soaring ballads cut from the same cloth as previous anthems like \\"All I Want Is You\\" and \\"Bad\\", and both would've been classics on any other U2 record (in fact, both sound much better in the context of their inclusion on \\"The Best Of 1990-2000\\" several years later). \\"If God Would Send His Angels\\" comes close to hitting that mark as well.  But when those three admirable tunes are surrounded by ho-hum material like \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\\" (the most boring song in U2's catalog), and \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" (hands down, the WORST song in U2's catalog - this is their version of Billy Joel's \\"We Didn't Start The Fire\\", rife with awkward dated pop culture references set against elevator music), they're not given a chance to stand out.  \\"Last Night On Earth\\" desperately wants to rock but doesn't, and \\"Miami\\" is sort of a Nine-Inch-Nails-by-way-of-Zeppelin fusion that tries to be both heavy and funky, and accomplishes neither (not a bad tune though). \\"Please\\" is a jazz-rock experiment released as a single many months after the album came out, and was heavily promoted in hopes that it would be the sleeper hit that would revive sales. Instead, it was the sleeper hit that just put everyone to sleep. Album closer \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" is interesting in that it's one of U2's most overtly spiritual tunes, at a time when it seemed they'd long abandoned that angle. The song relies on little more than a slow-moving Edge guitar riff that never really builds, and a heavily processed Bono vocal that finds him pleading to Jesus about the meaning of life. It's not really a classic, not really a clunker, but either way, not enough to save an album that clearly collapsed under its own ambitions.    U2 would wisely retreat to safer, more familiar ground for their next two records - \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" and \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\", and then would find just the right mix of classicism and experimentation on \\"No Line On The Horizon\\", but \\"Pop\\" was just too far off the beaten path for most fans, and now stands mostly as a curio in their vast catalog.
0312370849|3.0|I started off really liking this book. As the chapters flip-flopped between the story taking place in 1942 and the modern-day, 2002 events, was interested in both stories and how they would come together. Not knowing much about the history presented in the book (France's role with the exportation of Jews in WWII), I was intrigued and interested in this aspect.     Once they did come together, I was sorely disappointed. The narrator in the 2002 story, Julia, was entirely too predictable and obsessed in such a way that was beyond ridiculous. I found myself just wanting to tell her to get on with her life. And the author's \\"secrets\\" were well known before revealed in the book...again, so predicable.    Overall, I am not sure I can recommend it. It just fell apart for me too much at the end.
0792838912|5.0|...but I will try.  This movie is exquisite.  Let's put aside the sex (which, by the way, is ALWAYS shown with the characters still wearing most of their clothes!).  Adrian Lyne, the director, is a genius.  His camera work, his use of music to set a mood, his obvious adoration for New York City...that is all part of the genius of this film.  Let's also put aside Mickey Rourke's looks and charm and fantastic acting, which are also beyond words in this film.  The film manages all at once to be about power, love, manipulation, sex, control, ugency, fantasy, anger, electricity, relationship intensity, relationship flameout, letting go, holding back, inner conflict, and mystery.  Whatever you have heard there is no S&M or anything like that.  This is about a woman getting swept up in a very intense relationship, and realizing in the end that she wants and needs more; that you can't sustain that level of passion forever.  I'm not doing a very good job of explaining this, I am sure.  I admit that aside from Kim Basinger doing a striptease (even THAT is done in a genius way) and being (briefly) totally naked, this is gonna appeal more to women than to men (who will be rightfully jealous of Mickey Rourke...LOL); women's emotions will go from, \\"Aaaaw, that was so sweet of him!\\" to \\"Wow, she really had a lot of courage to do that.\\"  See it, see it, see it. If I could give it ten stars I would.
B00008NRL8|5.0|Really well done chillout album that leaves a strong taste of mate in your mouth (or perhaps some malbec).  Some songs are a bit experimental and go beyond the mid-tempo usually associated with chillout music, but still deliver solid lounge music for summer evenings to be enjoyed outside with a great red and some serious charcuterrie.
B004HD2ZIQ|4.0|Lemmy and crew are getting long in the tooth (Mr. Kilmister turned 65 in December), but there is no sign of slowing down on The World is Yours.  This latest collection of songs surges forward with urgency and drive.  There is no question that Motorhead have a distinctive sound and style, but this is not a recycling or rehash of past glory.    The strength of The World is Yours is in the music.  Songs such as \\"Rock 'n' Roll Music,\\" \\"Born to Lose,\\" and \\"I Know How to Die\\" are catchy without sacrificing any power. The kiss-off track \\"Bye Bye B**** Bye Bye\\" has a 50s rock riff on hyperdrive. On \\"Brotherhood of Man\\" (my pick for stand-out track), Lemmy outgrowls the competition.  The lyrics of the songs, when read from the enclosed booklet, seemed cliched, but they are great when combined with the music.    The World is Yours is not innovative, and it doesn't need to be.  It is a straightforward, in-your-face, fist-pumping experience.  Highly recommended.

I am shocked publishers allowed this to be released it was too long and drawn out mediocre and dull and written badly.

B000ULQV0W|4.0|This soundtrack to the film Into The Wild is basically a 30+ minute Eddie Vedder solo album. I'd call it a must for any fan of the book, the movie, or the lighter side of Pearl Jam. I saw the movie and loved it when it was a new release, but am only now currently reading the book. There's no doubt the story has effected alot of people, and the music here is just as moving. I'll say right-off my favorite track is Society, one of the two covers. Ed nails it. Hard Sun is the other cover, and was on radio alot when it came out, great tune too. The majority of the songs here are instrumentals though, maybe some humming and wails in a few spots for a nice touch. I'll admit listening to this makes me wanna plan a roadtrip or go on a hike. Where's my walking stick...
B0044DE906|3.0|The writing style was flowing quite well but i just lost interest in the characters.The story tells you about reality of everyday life for a few characters, their lives of sex politics and spin. There was one too many rants about the world and politics. For a book thats talked about in mainstream media alot packs quite alot of explicit sexual situations which the cover should have a warning to readers.
0375413405|5.0|This is a wonderful book which I was inspired to buy after seeing \\"Julia and Julia.\\"  Most of the recipes are far more difficult, both in skill needed and ingredients on hand, than I am willing to attempt.  But I did love Julia Child and bought this as a memento of her life.
0061205699|5.0|A wonderful piece of literature, written in easy to read style full of emotions growing up and drama. Theirs sadness and happiness, racism and equality, immaturity and maturity, injustice and redemption.  Atticus is a man we could all love and look up to a grounded just and fair man he sees beyond race and finds the goodness in people. His cook Calpurnia Is honest good black lady who you just gotta love in this story, she works for a nice family who are about to go through some obstacles and testing times.  A lot of the story is told through a young girl and is enjoyable to see things from a young perspective for example this excerpt...  \\"There was a man Dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggy island where all these babies were; you could order one-- \\"That's a lie. Aunty said God drops `em down the chimney. At least that's what I think she said.\\" For once, Aunty's diction had not been too clear.    The characters in the story face racism but a lot is put straight for example.....  \\"You know the truth, and the truth is this: some Negroes lie, some Negroes are immoral, some Negro men are not to be trusted around women--black or white. But this is a truth that applies to the human race and to no particular race of men.\\"    \\"Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\"

0439023513|2.0|I loved Katniss in the first book which was the best, the Hunger Games and Katniss is what made it a pageturner without the games this has become page snorer. In the movies most of the time you find sequel is not as great as the first and that theory holds ground with trilogies i find most of the time. The author could have done better maybe take some of the third book and made book 2 longer without this idea of making Harry potter continuations. It was disappointing to see series end in this manner which had something really good working, also alot of readers voted this as best of 2010 by far mine was Full Dark No Stars.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|Boy, ain't technology something!     I downloaded this camera app for my HTC Incredible and it has all these features - like timers (plural!). So I figured somebody must make a tripod to take advantage of such features. A search revealed that to be true - and I ordered this product in anticipation of using it during bicycle touring for those \\"me-Al-Franken\\" moments of vanity on the rides.    It came very quickly, seems well made and cleverly designed. No interference w/ the lens (okay, that's easy to plan for; the lens is tiny), while affording a full view from the flip side of the phone/camera. The legs are adjustable. The clamp system is easy to manipulate and it seems made for the Incredible. The legs are adjustable and the camera can tilt, thanks to a ball socket atop the legs. It's compact and light and just what I need.    One note: initially I had it in the clamp, inadvertently pressing a side button. I knew this because it triggered an app feature where \\"buddies\\" - pictures of the Queen, Obama, a pirate, and a couple women celebs - kept popping, one after the other, into the viewfinder/screen. A quick adjustment relieved the pressure on the button and the buddies went to sleep.
0143034901|5.0|\\"Sometimes we think people are like lottery tickets, that they're there to make our most absurd dreams come true.\\" - from THE SHADOW OF THE WIND<br /><br />\\"... a book is a mirror that offers us only what we already carry inside us ...\\" - from THE SHADOW OF THE WIND<br /><br />Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's THE SHADOW OF THE WIND is illustrative of the difference between a good novel that one can dash through grabbing entertainment value on the run and a good - perhaps great - novel in which one can take the time to luxuriate like immersion in a steamy bath on a cold, rainy day. Zaf&oacute;n's book is of the latter quality.<br /><br />The place is Barcelona and the time is 1945-1955. Ten year-old Daniel Sempere is introduced to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a labyrinthine repository of volumes no longer read much, if they ever were. Invited by his father to pick out a single tome as his own, Daniel selects THE SHADOW OF THE WIND, one of a handful of novels by Juli&aacute;n Carax. Enthralled by the book, young Sempere is puzzled to subsequently discover that the author has not only achieved obscurity but his works are disappearing from circulation, apparently by malicious design. Indeed, the boy himself is approached by a terrifying, disfigured man who scours the world for Carax's novels seeking to burn them. What's that all about, he puzzles.<br /><br />Daniel's ten-year quest for answers compels him into a tangled web of betrayals, cruelties, and the desperate and unrequited love affairs among a cluster of individuals over two generations, past and present. And the boy's own burgeoning hormones don't facilitate matters when it comes to making decisions that require cool judgment.<br /><br />The pleasures I get, or not, from food depend on three elements: taste, aroma, and consistency. Of late, I've come to more deeply appreciate these three components for reasons I gave in my review of [[ASIN:0618861882 Remembering Smell: A Memoir of Losing--and Discovering--the Primal Sense]]. Similarly, my enjoyment of a novel derives from the confluence of a trio of essential developments: plot, character and setting. Some extremely successful thriller writers get by on the first two only. In THE SHADOW OF THE WIND, the author achieves all three, and it's his manipulation of the settings in the mind's eye of the reader that renders the whole a cut above most. Whether he's describing the interior of a decayed mansion, a bleak city apartment in an ancient tenement, or the darkness of streets blacked out by a thunderstorm, the reader will find these locales almost palpable. For example, a hospice for the mad and society's other castoffs:<br /><br />\\"A front door of rotted wood let us into a courtyard guarded by gas lamps that flickered above gargoyles and angels, their features disintegrating on old stone. A staircase led to the first floor, where a rectangle of light marked the main entrance to the hospice. The gaslight radiating from this opening gave an ocher tone to the miasma that emanated from within. An angular, predatory figure observed us coolly from the shadows of the door's archway, her eyes the same color as her habit. She held a steaming wooden bucket that gave off an indescribable stench.\\"<br /><br />Oh my! Zaf&oacute;n's descriptive ability is brilliant. And that's why I'm awarding five stars.

0316098337|5.0|This is one of the most original and compelling novels I have enjoyed in a long time. The novel is narrated by a five year-old boy, Jack, who has spent his whole life in one small room, with his mother. Jack does not even know that life exists outside that room. The only other person he has ever seen is old Nick, their captor, in his nightly visits. Jack's mother works to make his upbringing as \\"normal\\" as possible in spite of their horrific life of captivity. The author does a great job letting us see Jack's mother fight to keep her sanity while caring for her son, all from Jack's naive perspective. The second half of this novel takes a major turn, something that I won't spoil. I will say that the second half was engaging, too, though not as riveting or original as the first half. This story has stayed with me. I listened to the audio-book, which was done amazingly well. The voices are haunting, especially that of Jack's mother. The reader for Jack makes a very believable five year-old. This is horror, beautifully and subtly done.
0385341679|5.0|I am going to start this review with three little words. OH. MY. GOD!  Those three little words sum up my whole experience with not only this book but the whole series!  Before the Fever series, I was never one to venture into the world of Urban Fantasy.  I like my books to have lots of romance and sexiness to them.  Yet, after hearing Smexy Books and Fiction Vixen rave about them, I decided to dive in to the genre I was reluctant to swim in.<br /><br />The book starts out with a grieving Mac who is in disbelief of who she just has killed at the end of Dreamfever.  Even though as the reader, we didn't know who she had killed at the end, we all thought we knew.  When it is revealed who it is, I was at a loss for words.  I was crying and yelling at the author for putting us through this journey to just turn around and kill this person!  I actually wanted to stop reading the series at this point. After complaining about it to my online friends, they kept telling me to read more.  They said it will get better and I needed to start looking past that point in the book and have faith in the author.  I am so glad I listened!<br /><br />I am not going to tell you who it was, but if you have read other reviews and noticed spoilers before, then you already have a clue to who it is.  All I can say is it does turn around and you will have your faith restored in the author.  This also means to be prepared for even more shocks to come.  I felt myself saying on many occasions that the author can't be doing this to me!  She can't do that!  Why must you torture us?  Why can't you quit playing with my emotions?  Yet, as the story progresses, you will find strength in Mac and she has grown into a fierce and vengeful person.  She has her reasons for doing things, and boy do they push her to the limit.<br /><br />For the romance readers out there, be prepared for the sexiness to heat up and you will be looking at different characters through different eyes by the end of the book.  You will see that all of those small players from previous books actually have important and critical roles in the whole scheme of the Fever series.  I was entranced with the Highlanders, in awe of Barrons and his men, captivated by the Fae, and strengthened by Mac's determination.  No one is what you think, and the end was perfect.You will not expect the ending that the author delivers!<br /><br />If you have not read this series yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Fiction Vixen told me before, \\"Best UF series evah!\\"  I agree and will definitely be reading this series over and over again!small players from previous books actually have important and critical roles in the whole scheme of the Fever series.

1594202842|5.0|I would say that this things are real!   There are parents that act like this. Heck I lived through it!   Btw she didn't say her kids were fat! But she did say they were lazy.   In my experience when I was about 7 yrs old I was a very skinny kid with a bulging stomach, I like malnourished for some reason.Back then a chubby kid was considered healthy and cute. My mother had this sense of worry in her face when she looks at me. She felt when I go outside or meet other people that I would look like I was deprived of food. At one point she couldn't take and just blurted out that I look like a Rwandan refuge, she took a Time magazine to illustrate what it looked like.   As Filipino-Chinese who were born and raised in the Philippines it was hard to understand a lick of Chinese! So I had a failing grade and the thing is every report card has to submitted to the parent and had to be signed. Seeing a failing from my overachieving mom was not something that I would consider a cake walk. I literally begged both of my parent to sign or else I won't be in class. It took about an hours worth to get my dad to sign it.   I think the biggest difference between Amy and my mother is that Amy goes to the trenches with her daughter sleepless night of piano or violin rehearsals. And if she ever dished a harsh insult to her kids she balances it out by letting her kids understand and she wants them to be the best. My mom would give insults to me and never once apologize for it or even explain the motivation of such horrid behavior.   Did this affect myself esteem! Yes very much! I guess I never felt that she was on my side anyways, I get petrified of ideas of failure. I personally believe that proper motivation still brings out of kids. I remember having a great chinese tutor when I was in grade school she adjusted for me and she understood me. We would do drills and we would practice but she understood how to make me better. I would remember her asking test question that I did two year after and I would still remember them well. It wasn't fun but she knew how to create tactics by either instilling fear in my mind or motivating me and encouraging instead just dishing insults for no reason.  I guess the book made me understand my mother at least a part of her! If u want fast results out your kids ie make them geniuses and prodigies at the age of 10 then yes this will make them better at specific skills. Do note however that this WILL affect their self esteem! I personally find Sophia a very aloof and unsociable child! Although this was never mentioned in the book I can personally tell base the slight hints that Amy puts out in her book.  I personally believe that this should be a movie. The books says of how horrible the fight between Amy and Lulu but I wanna see it a big screen! The book doesn't detail it well I would expect the movie will portray this very well. I personally will recommend Lucy Liu to be Amy Chua. I think she's the only actress than can bring to life Amy's viper tongue, unforgiving attitude towards her kids lol.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The Logitech G930 headset is a very nice headset. It works very well and connects to my Windows 7 laptop or desktop very well. I am using it and Dragon speak to do this review. Being wireless this is very nice. The range is outstanding at least 40 feet. I even walk outside using them and I like how they are crystal clear until they have no reception at all. And then it would just shut off until you walk back within reception. At what time they come on again. The surround sound is fantastic. The sound is exceptional. And the software that comes with them is also very good. I have had wireless headphones in the past and these are so much better it's unbelievable. I am talking several years back when the technology was not perfect. But I have had absolutely no problem with these headphones and am very satisfied and would recommend them to anyone. I also looked at the F540s but I needed the surround sound. I do wish they would connect up to everything like the F540's do. But for a computer these are fantastic. What I also like about them is that you can use them wirelessly or wired. Wirelessly the battery life is extremely good. The controls are very nice as well, especially the roller volume. The G keys are very limited to which programs they work with. It also has some very fun and unique morphine voices. I must say I love these headphones. The construction of these headphones is top notch quality. The problem with all of the headphones in the past was, the battery would eventually die. On these headphones you can change the battery if you have to.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I thought this was an amazing book. It hooked me right from the start and had me begging for moor. James Dashner did a spectacular job of creating dynamic characters and settings! This fantasy is a must have for your library!
0525423273|5.0|I kept hearing about this book from other people/blogs and they just can't stop raving about it. I feel thought that when a book is hyped so much, it usually doesn't live up to the expectations. Anna and the French Kiss broke the odds, and actually surpassed my expectations.<br /><br />I thought it would be a fun, light, and cute read. And while it was fun and cute, it was a deep and romantic novel. Anna voice was genuine and I could imagine a girl like her really existed out there. She seems like the average girl, funny, nice, good student... but with a little bit of sass. She stands up for what she wants and believes in. I liked how she never saw going to Paris for school as some sort of vacation. She was realistic about it, she missed her friends and family, even after she started making friends there.<br /><br />I also liked how neither Anna nor Etienne are perfect. Its not some fairytale love story. Its about chemistry and friendship and how love can blossom from that. Perkins is a great writer. The characters we so well developed, imperfections and all, and the some of the scenes jut made you smile to yourself while reading. In fact one of the notes I took while reading the book was \\"This scene is too cute.\\" I am usually more descriptive than that, but it really just made me smile.<br /><br />I seriously can't wait for Stephanie's next book Lola and the Boy the Next Door. I have always been a sucker for those type of stories.
3548281249|3.0|Shutter Island was a pretty good book overall but I had problems with the twists. In the book,  it was somewhat hard to keep track of what was going on, that is why this is one of the few time I can say I liked the movie better than the book. The movie was extremely well done and Leonardo DeCaprio really sold his part.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|what i got in the mail was what i ordered. i was a little thrown back that the box was written in japenese but it worked just fine. it has a long cord so i can play it anywhere. over all excelent buy and worth the extra money.
B003L20ICE|4.0|\\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is an entertaining little story about the ups and downs of family life, with the only notable off-the-beaten-track aspect of the movie being that the two parents in the family are both women. The movie's one other somewhat unusual element is the eventual involvement of a third parental figure, the formerly anonymous sperm donor who enabled the two women to start a family years before. But even that wasn't too unusual, as additional parental figures are something that straight families also regularly encounter, in the form of ex-spouses and ex-significant others.<br /><br />There are many reasons to enjoy this smart, engaging movie, but I think it especially helps that the strongest political statement the film makes is not to make a political statement, at least not an overt one. If there's a gay cabal in the shadows trying to use the movie to promote a message, the message seems to be a pretty innocuous one, something along the lines of, \\"Gay parents walk the same path as straight parents. Sometimes we make good decisions, sometimes we make stupid ones, sometimes we treat our partners well, sometimes we hurt them.\\"<br /><br />In any event, my wife and I both enjoyed this breezy little drama, which works especially well in the comfortable intimacy of your living room (or wherever you watch your movies at home). In fact, it wouldn't be bad if the movie's characters and scenarios were expanded into a television series... though of course you wouldn't get Annette Bening and Julianne Moore to reprise their roles. Both are excellent here.<br /><br />The movie looks and sounds fine on standard DVD, though the \\"rental only\\" version of the DVD that we watched didn't allow access to the several extras listed on the bonus features menu.  Accessing the extra features, which look interesting, won't be a problem with the retail version of the DVD available on Amazon and in retail stores.
B004132I20|5.0|As a fan of Jeremy Brett's portrayal of the great detective, I was skeptical about this re-imagined version. In my view, Brett is the gold standard.  How could this new version hope to compete with the excellent '80's series? Well, no, it doesn't compete with it all. Instead, it changes the game entirely.  And on its own merits, this series is wonderful!  What a joy!  The acting is superb and Benedict Cumberbatch is a worthy successor to Brett's mantle.  (I can't say better than that.) Martin Freeman is a delight as Watson; he portrays him with intelligence, gentle humor, and depth. This Watson is a capable colleague to Cumberbatch's Holmes, not merely a comic foil. The plots are intricate and exciting; the new setting (in modern-day London) is inspired.  All in all, it's rollicking good fun for even the most ardent of traditional Sherlockians.
B002ZG999U|4.0|Originally bought movie because Jason Stathem is in it, but was pleasantly surprised at how good it is. Really good paced action movie that keeps your attention. Stallone has outdone himself all the way around. I'd reccommend it to anyone.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|Thought this was a creative and interesting movie.  Best horror movie I saw in 2010, better yet, one of the best movies I saw in 2010.  If you like a horror movie with some bite in the story, rather than on the screen, see this movie!  There is still gore and a lot of blood, but the intelligent story is its biggest asset.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|What can I say, it's the third in the Twilight series, and I think the best movie so far. I read all the books, and saw this movie at the theater, but knew as soon as the DVD came out I would have to have it. Even if you haven't seen the first 2 this would still be a great one to see. I'm now anxiously awaiting number 4.
B0041EVYVK|2.0|I think the title of my review says it all. You just need to look up the black dub videos on youtube or vimeo and compare them with the album. The live videos have a fantastic, fresh, unadulterated feel, especially Trixie's voice sounds fantastic. On the album the voice is sanitized, dumbed down, made almost ordinary. Extremely dissapointing. I still think this band should be fantastic to see live, but this album is not doing them justice. I just wish Lanois would forget he's a producer and just be a musician.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|Law Abiding Citizen gives people a whole new look on justice. A man with nothing to lose goes to the extreme when he exposes all the loop holes in the American justice system. This is a fantastic movie. The cast is amazing and the scence are all crisp with the high definition of blu-ray. A must watch for any one wo loves a good action-thriller.
B000H5U832|3.0|I'm as big a Pixar fan as they come. I grew up with Toy Story, and they really hit their stride with flicks like Finding Nemo and WALL-E. Cars, though? Well, to be honest, I really don't like this film that much, if any at all.    I freely admit that this is just a personal thing, but I found no part of this movie particularly funny, interesting, or entertaining. I really like the concept and the kind of humor that could get out of it, but as far a i could see, their was no reason that the characters were cars. No attempt at any sort of car-related humor was attempted as far as I could see, and I think it was more of an excuse for Pixar to not have to animate people, because their people always look a little... well... scary.    All this aside though, I just found Cars to be very boring. the action was standard, the characters weren't really all that interesting (certainly not as interesting or complex as Finding Nemo's cast was) and I ultimately found myself checking my watch while watching it; never a good sign. The animation was Pixar quality, so nothing bad there, there were just no surprises to this movie. The story was standard with nothing new in the mix, the dialog between the characters was wooden and unnatural, and i think i was the only one who hated Larry the Cable Guy's car Mater. I just wanted to punch him, he was so annoying.    If you like this film, power to you. If you haven't seen this movie, trust me; go watch Finding Nemo again, or go see The Incredibles, that's an okay one too. Just don't waste your time; Cars isn't worth it.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Departures is one of the best films I've seen in years - foreign or otherwise. It is not acutely serious, is quietly humourous, and sweet all the same time. There is no violence, no sex, no innuendo - just a heartwarming story about the importance of family, from the perspective of both loving them while you have them, and making sure you have no regrets when they're gone. It's about honesty, dignity, and respect.<br /><br />Captivating, well-developed performances from all the actors. Not for the viewer who gets bored easily - which in turn is what makes it an excellent film. It takes it's time to tell the story in a non-rushed-yet-not-dragged-out method.<br /><br />One of the rare times I wish I could rate a film more than 5 Stars.
0440243688|4.0|Starts off like a house on fire then explodes into a bloody ending.  Highly implausible but what a corker.  Reacher is the baddest dude in Manhattan.  Like any of this would happen but hey, suspend reality and let the story unfold. Twists and turns from beginning to end.  A rip-snort-in' read but you gotta buy into the pure nonsense.  Incredibly violent too but I couldn't put it down so there!
0307266303|5.0|Since I am not a religious person, I can say that no book has ever influenced my life like this one.  I am currently reading it for the third time.  I am 57 and have run for nearly 30 years, but I was intrigued when I heard about this book and how a different style of running can enable me to run ANOTHER 30 years.  It is absolutely wonderful how McDougall weaves the anthropology and physiology of running around this incredible story of the Taramuhara, Caballo Blanco, and the amazing marathoners and ultramarathoners. What facinating characters!!  This book has recharged my enthusiasm for running and given me a new perspective about footwear and running technique. Now my passion is trail running.  I put this book on my iphone so I can continually keep reading it.
B001F6TXME|5.0|What can be said. Delivery was prompt and the remote works great with my camera (D7000). It plugs into the same port as the external GPS unit so if you use your GPS frequently, this may not be the right remote for you.
B004LQI0HE|2.0|The acting was very believable, however the subject matter was so depressing that it was difficult to watch.  I wanted there to be a happy ending.......
B001FB4W0W|2.0|After finally getting around to reading the books I finally decided to see the television show and oh dear...it was not what I expected.  I get that sometimes the books varry from the television shows; however, I found the show very annoying and boring.  I found Sookie's character to be annoying and I am attributing that to the accent and her whiney big girl attitude.  Bill's character seemed overly stiff.  Jason was just having sex with just about anything with a pulse and doing it at various speeds might I add.  The only character I liked and the only reason I don't completely hate it is due to Eric's character.
B003RKYE5M|3.0|This review of Iron Maiden \\"Final Frontier\\" is for the japanese special metal tin edition. \\"Final Frontier\\" by Iron Maiden is a good cd. But the audio levels are lacking for a new release that came out 2010. I have lots of cds that came out in 2010 that play louder than the new Maiden cd. It is really unfortunate that a record company does not make any good use of today's technology when it comes to recording cds. Considering this is a special edition that comes in a metal tin from Japan, it is also unfortunate that this is not a SHM CD. If it was a shm release the audio levels would be better and the cd would play louder. Overall The new Maiden cd is good but lacks volume because of a record company did not make an effort to use todays technology when it comes to recording cds.
0312370849|3.0|This novel definitely whets my appetite to learn more about the Jews living in France in the 1940s. Sarah's story was heartbreaking. The first half of the novel was thought provoking and tragic. The second half was not worth mentioning. Julia's story was prosaic at best; her obsession with Sarah was bizarre. Her need to insinuate herself into Sarah's life/family was inappropriate and narcissistic. This novel could have been so much more.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|This item was listed as a plug and play. It was purchased as a birthday present for my wife which was coming up.  When given, tried to use, replaced sound card, paid someone to come over to try to make it work (communications expert) and he could not get it working properly.  So upshot is over $100 for item that does not work.  Poor write up for item.  Tried adding new software, etc.  Piece of worthless junk!!!

B003UESJEM|3.0|Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck), the star salesman at a ship builder, arrives at work one day to find he has been laid off. He searches for his boss and mentor, Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones), the number two man and learns he is away at a conference. Returning home, he tells his wife, Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt) the news. She is shocked but puts on a game face and immediately starts making plans; they can sell the house, she can go back to work, Bobby can sell his Porsche. But Bobby is confident he can find another six-figure sale position very quickly. Gene returns to home base and learns of the lay offs. Confronting Salinger (Craig T. Nelson), his long time friend and the head of the company, he learns the lay offs were done in an attempt to boost the company's flagging stock value. Gene doesn't agree with the business plan but stays to try to stem the flow of blood. Soon, his friend Phil (Chris Cooper) is laid off. Both men have great difficulty adjusting. Eventually, Bobby is forced to make his last choice move; he must go to work for his brother-in-law Jack (Kevin Costner), a contractor restoring an old house. Bobby doesn't like him or get along with him, but he needs the work.<br /><br />\\"The Company Men\\", the new film from writer-director John Wells, one of the people behind \\"ER\\", \\"LA Law\\", \\"Shameless\\" and many other television hits, is a timely, prescient film featuring an impressive cast. And it has many good points. But ultimately, I failed to connect with the film to the degree I was expecting.<br /><br />Ben Affleck plays Bobby, the cocky young salesman who is very good at his job. He also enjoys spending the money he earns on a fancy house and all the things his family could need; a Porsche and golf club membership for him, his wife doesn't need to work. Life is good. And it's better because they are living beyond their means. When Bobby gets laid off, he is shocked, but also confident it is a temporary thing. He must not watch the news much.<br /><br />Bobby feels betrayed by Gene, his boss. And as he realizes the job market is a lot scarier that he thought, his frustration becomes almost palpable. We witness an interview he has for a potential job and can identify with his anger with the overworked, supercilious human resources executive. Then, he finally gets a lead and travels to Chicago for an interview.<br /><br />It is difficult to call Bobby the central character of the film, Gene seems to have almost equal screen time, but he is meant to be our guide into this narrative. Because of this, we identify with and have empathy for him. His life is like most of ours. We work, we have families, and we live beyond our means. When something bad happens, the world self-destructs.<br /><br />Affleck is perfectly cast in this role and deftly portrays Bobby. It is interesting to watch the resurgence of Affleck's career. After a string of particularly bad films, he resurfaced a few years ago and directed the well-made and well-praised \\"Gone Baby Gone\\", ending a few year long sabbatical from Hollywood. He proved that \\"Gone\\" was not a fluke with \\"The Town\\", also featuring one of his best performances. Now, he adds another impressive star turn to his IMDB profile.<br /><br />Gene McClarey is meant to be the conscience of the company and he is clearly willing to question and fight every one of Salinger's decisions. They have known each other for decades and worked together for almost as long. When the company decides to lay off \\"thousands\\" and leaves the HR people to come up with a list of possible redundancies, he realizes something is wrong. He certainly enjoys the benefits of his salary and position; he and his wife live in a beautiful house on the water, his wife thinks nothing of spending $16,000 on an antique side table. But Gene also wants to do everything he can do to save the jobs of the employees. They are real people. There has to be an alternative. There must be and he won't stop until he finds it.<br /><br />Tommy LeeJones is also expertly cast. When Gene doesn't get what he wants, he feels betrayed and you can see the pain etched in his face. This helps us understand why he is trying so hard to help so many.<br /><br />Chris Cooper plays Phil, a former shop foreman who has worked long and hard to get to the executive office. Once there, he enjoys the fancy lunches and other aspects of his life too much. When he gets laid off, he has the most difficult time adjusting because people take one look at him and dismiss him.<br /><br />Each of the three men are representative of two different generations and three different types of people hurt by massive lay offs at large corporations. They are meant to illustrate the problems happening everywhere all over the country.<br /><br />Maria Bello plays Sally, the HR person who is in charge of making all of these layoffs happen. You can see a dead quality in her eyes. She doesn't enjoy the job, but she does it because it is her job. Also, Sally must know that at some point she is also going to have to deliver a severance package to herself.<br /><br />And Costner's Jack is meant to be the everyman, the man who is doing everything right. Living modestly, and within his means, he has a large, happy family and helps his employees, guys who also have large happy families.<br /><br />\\"The Company Men\\" is really a lot more subtle than my synopsis of each man's plight might lead you to believe. But it isn't subtle enough. There is a strange disconnect in this film. Yes, it's subtle, but because everyone is so clear-cut, each character has a clear mission in the story. Because Jack is so clearly the one we should be emulating, the narrative almost seems a little preachy. This is what you should have done and because you didn't, you're now in this mess. And this ultimately becomes annoying, rising to the surface, obscuring any of the good, honest performances. I think we understand the problem after watching hours of newscasts and reading hundreds of pages of articles. To have Wells address this issue through Jack and Bobby's performances just seems to be rubbing it in. And this really left a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Which is a shame because each of the actors is very good and their performances seem custom fit for each of their personas.<br /><br />\\"The Company Men\\" is an Oscar worthy film in many ways. All of the performances are very good and each of the actors is very Oscar-friendly. The studio apparently agrees because they released the film for a one-week limited engagement in December. All films must play for at least a week before December 31 in order to qualify for the Academy Awards. I think they expected at least a couple of nominations to help provide them with a marketing tool when the film was ultimately released 'wide' in January. Unfortunately, the film received no nominations for either the Golden Globes or the Oscars. Perhaps the Academy voters felt the same way and recognized the film was not subtle enough to deserve such recognition.<br /><br />Now, if the Academy voters would only agree with me about all films.he wants, he feels betrayed and you can see the pain etched in his face.

B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Listen, I love the content and the science in this book.  It makes total sense that the old way of looking at fat loss is wrong. Mr. Taubes tells us in the introduction that he was compelled to write this book after people that read 'Good Calories, Bad Calories' asked him to make a book that the average Joe could read, one for the laypersons and that doctors could give thier patients.  Please!!! The information in this book is so redundant and convoluted that Mr. Taubes could and should easily shave 500 pages or more out of it to be average Joe friendly. If anyone was given this book by thier doctor to help them understand how to lose fat. They would put it down after the first chapter and that's a shame. Mr. Taubes please write a book that is truly easy to read and understand. The information is urgent, necessary and valuable but it is in no way easily conveyed in its current style. Maybe do a reprint as a 'Why we get fat and what to do about it' for dummies!  We need this information to be simple for people to understand the basics of weight gain and the best methods to counteract this public health disaster. Not everyone out there understands the scentific method nor should they need to in order to benefit from the valuable content in this book.
0312600844|4.0|The first two chapters were wonderful; the rest of the novel was good.  There were some rather abrupt changes in character, but they all made some kind of sense.   I am not sure Franzen did as good a job as he could have in portraying the complex relationship between Walter and Richard, and I wish Franzen liked Walter more, though he certainly respected him. Franzen allows his protagonist to explain her behavior:  if only she had acted on her impulses toward Richard as a young woman, he would not have had the hold on her imagination which he did.       More than anything, Freedom is about characters wrestling with their consciences.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|The theatrical version of the movie (1977) has a very low resolution. How low? Well I made some test... it is noticeable but bearable in a 26\\" hdtv, it is almost unbearable in a 55\\" hdtv and it is a sad torture on the 106\\" image produced by my Full HD 1080p projector. So I do not recommend this unless you have quite small a tv set.
B0008ENHTE|4.0|Rate: 8<br />Viewed: 3/03, 1/06, 11/11, 6/15<br /><br />1/06: The difference between Bullitt and most policiers is the no-frills, no-thrills old fashioned cop work. That's how Steve McQueen wants it done.<br /><br />And of course, the reward for sitting through it is to watch the greatest car chase ever put on film.<br /><br />My favorite part is actually the clash of personalities between Frank Bullitt and Walter Chalmers. What makes Steve's character likeable is his cool persona, and what makes Robert Vaughn's character unlikeable is his forceful insistence.<br /><br />Bullitt would have been a better picture if the sappy romance is downplayed a bit.<br /><br />All in all, Bullitt is slightly dated and slow-paced, but Steve McQueen is still the King of Cool.<br /><br />11/11: Having seen Bullitt again, my opinion hasn't changed a bit.<br /><br />It's still a no-frills, no-thrills policier that would influence the makings of Dirty Harry and The French Connection.<br /><br />Steve McQueen is perfect as Frank Bullitt, and so is Robert Vaughn as Walter Chalmers. On the other hand, Jacqueline Bisset is still distracting and remains the weak link.<br /><br />Obviously, the key scene of Bullitt is the high-speed car chase through the streets of San Francisco which remains the highlight no matter how many times the movie is seen.<br /><br />All in all, Bullitt is among Steve McQueen's greatest hits.<br /><br />6/15: The one that started it all, Bullitt is an influential policier that has created a unique wave of cop pictures such as Dirty Harry and The French Connnection which are more raw in nature.<br /><br />Steve McQueen founded Solar Productions, and the first film for the company was Bullitt. His goal was to make a film that represented his vision; he wanted little dialogue as possible, a simple plot, the San Francisco setting, on-set shooting, high realism in police procedures, and the best car chase ever as the showpiece.<br /><br />While at that, he searched for the right director, and he found one in Peter Yates because of his work with Robbery. What Steve wanted out of him was the understanding and vision of how car chase should go down. And the rest was history.<br /><br />Steve McQueen plays Frank Bullitt, a no-nonsense cop who doesn't mince words, and when he does, it's usually a conversation killer. He follows the letter of the law and gets results.<br /><br />That's why there is nothing flashy about Bullitt. It's all straight-forward police work. Steve is perfect as the eponymous lieutenant as he puts his Method acting to work and makes most of the minimalism with his facial expressions.<br /><br />Frank Keller's award-winning editing coupled with William Fraker's cinematography make Bullitt a stylish policier that's unlike a lot of films. It's really the last fifteen minutes that makes a point of how facial expressions can make for a thriller.<br /><br />Of course, the car chase, one of the best on film, is unforgettable, powerful, and jolting. What's brilliant about it is the over-the-shoulder shot to make me feel like I am on a ride inside of the car.<br /><br />Almost rivaling the car chase is the title sequence by Pablo Ferro. It's one of the very best I've every seen in any film, and once you see that, that's when you know you are going to be in for a ride.<br /><br />Apart from the deathly slow pace, the worst part of the film is Jacqueline Bisset. Although she is not a scene-killer, the high allotment of her screen-time is unnecessary. There are several scenes with her character and Bullitt, especially after the incident at San Mateo Thunderbolt Hotel, that are superfluous. Minimalized shots of her are enough to show their relationship in a subtle way. In fact, the less said, the better.<br /><br />Although Steve McQueen is the star of the show, it's really Robert Vaughn that steals the scene as Walter Chalmers. Every time he appears, I am like, &#34;He doesn't look pleased.&#34; Hence, he is a scary guy because of his political clout. In short, he plays his oily self-aggrandizing politician to perfection.<br /><br />I love Don Gordon as Steve's sidekick, and he has an interesting face. Robert Duvall has a short appearance which enhances Bullitt more. Simon Oakland, who has a brilliant part in Pyscho, is fun to watch. Everybody else is sinister-looking and plays their parts very well.<br /><br />All in all, Bullitt is one of the greatest San Francisco pictures with the one of the most stylish title sequences ever and the best car chase ever filmed.ace. Robert Duvall has a short appearance which enhances Bullitt more. Simon Oakland, who has a brilliant part in Pyscho, is fun to watch.

0385342047|2.0|I have enjoyed most of Sophie Kinsella's novels but this one left me cold.  I simply kept hoping that Becky would either grow up or get her comeuppance and finally learn that \\"stuff\\" does not equal happiness.  There is only so much one can take of the \\"I've got it all and I want still more\\" attitude and while Becky appears warm and affectionate, the fact that she is constantly lying is a decided turn off for me.    I will not be reading any more of this series, if they appear.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|I'm really enjoying Truth of Touch for its uplifting feel and varied melodies & rhythms that traverse this CD.    I'm also very pleased that it contains so many wonderful instrumentals and that Yanni has continued to compose and share his incredible talent with the world.     Definitely a 5+ star rating!!!!!
B00110K62U|5.0|In observing other reviews of this product, I must have received one of the recent editions after the problems had been corrected because I thought the performance, video and sound quality were outstanding.  My equipment is of mid-range quality, so maybe the 2.0 Dolby doesn't get as critically exposed as with state-of-the art equipment.  I often play my CD's on my TV player because the clarity often eclipses my Bose Wave Radio, so unless my hearing in my old age is worse than I thought, the product I received is of reputable quality.  Additionally, I experienced no \\"grainy video\\" as others have reported.  It was sharp and brilliant!  And this cast with Quast and Wilkinson bearing the banner is by far my favorite overall ensemble!
B0029LHX1W|5.0|This story grabs you by the throat and holds on until the very end. I would also recommend the HBO movie Citizen X which is a fact based account of the serial killer featured in Child 44.
B002JVWR0Y|4.0|For all of its dark humor, irony, blood and edginess, Dexter has always been driven by its characters.  Each of the major players in this fantastic series comes complete with richly developed personas, mixed motives and conflicting emotions.  Perhaps none more so than Dexter himself who has evolved (in his own eyes as well as in the audience's) from a souless sociopath to a complex human being with the capability to view the world in shades of grey and to consider the possibility that he may not be as much of a monster as he once thought.  Season 4, which may be the best so far, explores the many facets of Dexter's ever changing personality and also provides some possible foreshadowing as to what fate lies in store for he and his family.<br /><br />Dexter is juggling several different roles as things pick up.  He is newly married and a father to boot.  He quickly finds that carrying out these duties severely interferes with the needs of his dark passenger.  In one subplot, he gets very sloppy following a kill due to sleep deprivation.  He finds himself wondering if it is possible for him to continue having a family while also feeding his bloodlust.  That's where The Trinity Killer comes in to play.  Portrayed by John Lithgow in a superb performance that earned him an Emmy and a Golden Globe, Trinity is a mirror image of Dexter.  He maintains a seemingly picture perfect family and community life as a cover for his heinous murders.  Dexter is fascinated by his ability to maintain his facade so effortlessly.  Instead of doing away with Trinity early on, Dexter incorporates himself into his life in an attempt to gain insights on how he can more effectively maintain his own public and private lives.  Needless to say, some serious cracks are revealed in the picture perfect world that Trinity has built which forces Dexter (and the audience) to accept the reality that it is not going to be possible for Dexter to maintain his own idyllic life forever.<br /><br />Hall and Lithgow are both outstanding as the two men who are mirror images of one another and their cat and mouse game is the heart of season 4.  But the other characters figure prominently into the mix.  Deborah finds herself questioning her relationship with Antoine when FBI agent Frank Lundy returns to Miami, Quinn evolves from a self-absorbed jerk to a more complex individual and Angel and Maria become involved in a serious relationship.  As usaual, everyone is at the top of their game which helps elevate season 4 of this series to a brilliant series to new heights.  Bring on season 5.h outstanding as the two men who are mirror images of one another and their cat and mouse game is the heart of season 4.  But the other characters figure prominently into the mix.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|I bought this HDMI cord knowing nothing about the Amazon Basics brand, but to my surprise it has beaten all other HDMI cords I have used, and that with flying colors. The first thing I noticed was the audio quality. I have a Monster HDMI I bought on black friday and I thought it was good but plugging in the Amazon Basics cord I found a dramatic increase in the quality of audio output from my Xbox 360 next I noticed the colors and the amazing way my TV looked with the new cord versus the old one. a bonus was the length I got an extra 3 feet of cord for roughly the same price as the Monster cable. Overall I think this is a must buy for all HDTV owners.

B002ZG98C8|1.0|A really horrible movie, worst I have ever seen.  The only value in it is showing the typical hypocrisy of a right wing politician who campaigns against the \\"illegals\\" from Mexico while all the time profiting from them.  Goes on every day, by the way.
B004BLTNL6|5.0|I first saw this on vhs back in the 80's and was stunned beyond belief. My brother and I watched it and couldn't believe this film existed. It's quite possibly the most intense, shocking, disturbing movie ever. It's well written, superbly acted and shot just right. This movie set the bar for all so called women's revenge movies. And no ones come close to it so far. Not for the faint of heart, or children. Keep in mind this was made in 1978, so it won't have people your familiar with. Watch it if you dare. I'm getting bot the original and remake.
B0001AP13A|2.0|I've always enjoyed this album as a CD but was very disappointed when I received the Vinyl album and I couldn't even listen to it because it would change speeds and voice tones and would skip around.. Nothing against the music they just need to make a new Master Record or something to correct the problems.. Good Luck with yours Buyers
0143112724|5.0|For over 50 years, William Strunk Jr & E. B. White's \\"The elements of styles\\" has given facts and rules about English language and writing. Half a century later some of these suggestions, so to speak, have been overcame, but, on the other hand, many of them are still quite useful - especially for the wannabe writers and students.  But, if not for those who dared to break some suggested laws the literature could be in a standstill.<br /><br />What is very useful about this book is that it is very sensible when it comes to give advices. \\"Omit needles words\\", \\"use the active voice\\", \\"express coordinate ideas in similar form\\" are some of them. Many are a little out of date, but most of them are still quite useful. In a time when people want to type fast, or use only 140 characters, abbreviations are very common, but very annoying as well. \\"They [abbreviations] distract [the readers'] attention and exhaust his patient\\".<br /><br />In the special edition of \\"The elements of style\\" Maira Kalman's illustrations make reading the book a colorful experience. Her drawings help to highlight and fixate the main points, but what is most beautiful about Strunk & White's book is that the authors know that language is a entity in constant change. \\"The language is perpetually in flux: it is a living stream, shifting, changing, receiving new strength from a thousand tributaries, losing old forms in the backwaters of time\\". It is as if they were inviting us to break the very same rules they have just exposed - after all, rules are made to be broken.
B002ZG9940|5.0|I love this film. It's not for everyone, but what film is? Yes, it's slow, but it's beautiful in the way it slowly builds suspense as to what's going to happen and how Clooney's character is going to accomplish his goals. Also, it's a beautifully shot film, in beautiful locations.
B001PO53IO|4.0|This was a good purchase, the only down fall was that it did not come with the pilot episode.  I finally realized that the Clone Wars Movie was the pilot episode, just a longer version.  Other that that is a great purchase :)
B0021L8V0M|5.0|If you like action-filled spy movies you will love this one.  There is absolutely no reason for anyone to give this less than 5 stars, and I suspect those reviewers who do are teen-age members of a Jennifer Anniston fan club.      \\"Salt\\" is what ALL spy movies, and ALL action/drama movies SHOULD be like.  Angelina Jolie has proven she can do action, drama, comedy and romance, but the role of Evelyn Salt must have been written with her in mind because she is so perfect in it.  She carries the movie, very well, thank you, in virtually every scene and through numerous fight scenes.  It is believable and throughly involving.  It's a mystery/thriller, a spy movie, and a super action-packed roller-coaster ride of great entertainment.  Very watchable, and well worth the money to buy and watch again and again.  My only suggestion is...more, please?
B004132I4S|5.0|First of all, I would sincerely like to know if anyone can tell me of an artist out right now who is as expansively creative and original in their musical endeavors as Sufjan. Please let me know if there is, so  I can then buy their albums and stop playing this one out. Please and Thanks.     If you can listen to the depth in Sufjan's music, the intricacies in his orchestration, his brilliant lyrics & vocal arrangements and not be touched, then I'm just not sure your musical awareness is well developed....Sure, there are many many talented musical artists, but those artists generally follow a formula that works for them and their sound-albeit amazing-is marginal. Said artists may evolve from album to album, but I have never seen a complete rebirth as evidenced by Sufjan in The Age of Adz. Let me also say that I ADORE his classics Illinoise, Seven Swans, & Michigan. I have been entranced by those albums, they touch me very deeply on an emotional level. However, the Age of Adz is probably his best album because it is able to encompass all that Sufjan is capable of. Sort of like a culmination of all of his musical experiments that have somehow been transmuted into a radically new sound. There are new emotions, new ideas and yet you still feel the safety and purity of the old Sufjan.       There are mixed opinions on Sufjans choice to go electronic. Personally I was stoked when I found out, never doubting that this project was going to be spectacular. Calm down folk lovers, and respect the fact that we're dealing with a prodigy. How many instruments does he play? Was it 20?..... Let him evolve. Let that genius mind continue on it's journey and be grateful that we get to partake in it. Listening to The Age of Adz is a soaring cerebral adventure. It is all at once spiritual, haunting, ecstatic, romantic, profound....as far as this album is concerned, I think Sufjan says it best, \\"words are futile devices.\\"        The album is a grower, and that is simply because it is designed that way. It is so complex and so well done that it cannot be grasped in a single listen. Savor it!!    My favourite songs in no particualar order:    1) Futile Devices- (this song made me realize I loved someone. Im not kidding)  2) I walked   3) Bad Communication  4) All for myself  5) Now that Im older  6) Impossible Soul- (at 10:35 Sufjan with autotune. Nearly passed out from excitement on first listen. 10:36-13:00 are easily some of the best 3 mins of music I have ever heard in my life)    I never take the time to review. Ever. This album is worth it. I want to make sure as many people are blessed with the gift of this music. If Ive helped convince you in any way to buy this album, then this review was totally worth my time.     LOVE YOU SUFJAN!!!!!!!

B000X418UO|5.0|Gotta love the cast of this movie.  All big-name people doing what would otherwise most definitely have been a solidly b-list affair.  And maybe it still is, but it's cinematic entertainment at its best as far as I'm concerned.
1936594366|3.0|I'm not sure whose fault it is but I found no less than 15 typos in this short book.  Pretty glaring mistakes that makes me wonder if anyone read this copy before it went to print.  Do yourself a favor and find a different version of this great book.

B004KABG2M|4.0|One main thing I learned from this book is that all  decent approaches work.  What is important is to   find the one that suits you.  Over-diversification  works.  So does little diversification.  Fundamental  Analysis works.  So does Technical Analysis.  So   does Fundamental with Technical Analysis.  Pickign  the middle of a trend works.  So does picking tops  and bottoms.     A commonality in all the interviewed traders seem to  be good money and risk control: Keep your trades   small, especially for new traders.          8 Feb 11

B004KPQK2S|1.0|A 10 year old could have done a better job directing. It's *sort* of about a horse, it's *sort* about an owner, it's *sort* about the comeback of trainer, but only skims all of them while indulging us in none. You can't blame the cast - these people are good, yet completely disengaged while on screen.  Malkovich is hurrying through it as if he's got something better to do (he probably did!) and Ozzy Ozborn would have been more convincing as the owner than Diane Lane.  A complete disservice dealt to the greatest racehorse that ever lived. Watch Seabiscuit instead.  That was excellent and everything this should have been.
044654759X|5.0|So far, this is one of my favorite books Mr. Sparks has written. Its a little different than anything he's done before, in my opinion. From Start to Finish, I literally had to force myself to put it down, just so that i could go to sleep! one of his best yet, total must read for Spark's Fans.
B003L20ICO|4.0|The Kid's are all right, directed by Lisa Cholodenko (Lie With Me), does a good job at executing this film. There is a fair amount of humor, good drama with amazing acting performances, twists and lies that keep you interested, and 3 Academy award nominees all in the same movie. Nonetheless it is impressive. I do personally think the film ended semi-abruptly, but no biggy. I just would've liked maybe another ten minute or so to give a better wrap up, is all. I also like Mrs. Bening the most out of everyone's performance and can see how she got a golden globe for best actress with this flick. On the other hand, many may remember that this movie won a golden globe for best comedy. Nothing against the film, but it definitely more of a dramedy than an actualy comedy. It's like funny people, a drama with funny moments in it, for example. Overall, I'd say 8 out of 10 though soley based on acting purposes. It was just enjoyable. I'm a straight twenty year old guy and enjoyed it. I'm sure many others will, so instead of renting something that'll suck, rent something with  good performances and an interesting story of a set of lesbian parents who wanted to raise a family, and just like any other family...have their issues and feel unappreciated towards one another, and are real people just like you and I.<br /><br />-Cam
0061726826|5.0|What is love? According to the Consortium, love is a disease. Amor deliria nervosa is a terrible sickness that when not treated, can lead to death. Fortunately, a cure has been developed. Lena Holoway cannot wait to be cured. She can't stand the idea of being infected; she just wants to live a calm, painless, safe life. Because for Lena, safety is a good thing. She doesn't want to end up like her mother. But everything changes when Lena meets him. And despite all her warnings to herself and her desire to be the girl everyone expects her to be, Lena can't stop herself, because once you've been infected with the deliria, there's no going back. And Lena doesn't know if she even wants to.    Delirium is a tragically beautiful masterpiece of dystopian fiction. I love reading about dystopias because they are removed but usually not entirely implausible situations of the world gone wrong. Oliver's dystopia in Delirium is just riveting. The thought of love as a legitimate disease is both fascinating and appalling at the same time. And Oliver sets this world up wonderfully by giving adequate background to the development of the cure, the present procedures set in place to prevent an outbreak of the deliria, and the relationship between the deliria and society. In regards to the actual story, it's hard not to be sucked in. A combination of the deliria, Lena's vivid character, and an irresistible plot makes Delirium impossible to set down. Although the general direction of the plot and Lena's change of heart is predictable, this will not lessen the reader's enjoyment in the least. Oliver already proved herself a skilled and creative writer in her debut Before I Fall, and I think that she has outdone herself in Delirium. This powerful and heart wrenching tale will reach out to all readers and make them reconsider the little things they take for granted, like emotions as simple as love.     Delirium is a must read for all fans of dystopian fiction, including Birthmarked by Caragh M. O'Brien, The Giver by Lois Lowry, and Candor by Pam Bachorz. Oliver is an author to watch, and I greatly anticipate her next novel.

B000QFW7UA|5.0|I am totally shocked by those who have attacked this movie. Yes!...it is predictable. Yes!...the kids are annoying at times. But what a fun, escape from reality joy ride. I am what I call a movie snob, and I have loved this movie since the first day I saw it. I am now 47 yrs old and still enjoy it. This will be shown to my grandkids, and I will enjoy it then. For those who do not like this movie for its' content...you have that right...but still, I feel sorry for you. Where is the kid in you? Peace be with you always. THE GOONIES ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|I saw this movie on TV and loved it so much I went out & bought it. it is afun movie that made me laugh when I needed a good laugh! I love the songs, ABBA 's songs are great and this movie put even more meaning into them. As for Pierce Brosnan's singing ...it wasn't very good, just OK, but it actually made the movie a bit more real if you let yourself get caught up in the story. Not everyone can have a great voice, but the point of the movie was to be fun, entertaining and it made me laugh.  So in this movie he was just an ordinary man in the story singing his feelings, but the rest of the cast singing was great, so for his one song...who cares?... he acted out the movie well. I will watch it again & again...I just wish I had gotten it on Amazon as it costs me about $5 more for it locally. I have seen it twice & look forward to seeing it again & again as a fun, feel good musical with an outstanding cast. Whenever, I need a pick me up I will watch this movie as I find myself singing the songs for a few days after seeing it and it makes me feel good...what more can you ask of a movie. Laughter they say is the best medicine and music makes you feel emotion. So if anyone out there is looking to buy this movie & you want something you'll enjoy,and want to get lost in the fun & joy of it and even if you never heard ABBA songs, you'll want to get this movie.

B002TJR5HG|5.0|The vinyl set is completely amazing.  It has 7 180gr vinyls, each in a  cardboard fold that display several  facts taken from old books or newspapers.  All of them are contained in a hard box.  Big booklet with photos and lyrics is  also here.    The sound is by far superior than the CD's  (as usual) and i'd say that this set  is almost a piece of art by per se.  Form and content are just insanely GREAT!!!    Buy it!
B0030E1XJU|5.0|This toy is like a domino effect course. If you have ever played the game mouse trap it is very similar.  It is a chain reaction toy when you set it up right. I got this for my 4 year old for Christmas and he plays with it all the time.

B000FVNX2Q|5.0|As a recent university graduate, I have enrolled in the CFA program. The CFA Institute only allow the HP 12C and the Texas Instruments BAII Plus for the purposes of the level 1 examination. I had heard/read mixed reviews about both calculators, but eventually decided to go with the HP12C Platinum. This was because I had previously worked with a HP 10BII at university real estate finance and investment courses and wanted a familiar key pad and layout.     Although it has taken some adjusting, the 12C Platinum promises to be everything that my previous calculator was and more. Of note is the instruction manual/users guide which can be easily found online and downloaded. It offers numerous worked examples to get you up to speed. I would recommend this calculator to all real estate and finance students and future professionals.

0307269752|4.0|Larsson has a nice way with his writing but you can sometimes get lost with all of the different characters, their names and how they fit into the story.  Characters at time come at you fast and furious.  But I liked the book and am on the second in the series.  The story is a bit predictable but it still kept my interest.  The mystery was solved with about 60 or so pages to go and I hoped there would be a hook thrown in there so something would be left unresolved.  That was not the case and the pages at the end just wind down the story.<br /><br />One thing that snagged the reading was all of the Swedish names (mostly the streets and towns) and trying to figure out how to pronounce them.  With all the names of streets that ended in \\"gatan\\" I'm guessing that is used in place of \\"street\\" or \\"road\\".<br /><br />I still think it's a good read and would recommend it anyone who likes fiction and mysteries.

One in a million  has great guitar work but one thing i hate about it is the lyrics very immature,very ignorant and very racist. I think the lyrics ruined that song.  I hate racism period!!! And i cant believe slash let those lyrics fly i would of quit the band after my band wanted to play dirt like that.  Other than that great guitar album slash and izzy and duff you guys are great musicians.
B001FB5634|4.0|Gritty and honest. Not unlike the book. It did cautiously veer from the more disturbing scenes in the book, but probaby had to, to be allowed to run or be rated at all.<br />It was depressing and sobering. It imagined a similar world I myself imagined while reading the novel by Cormack McCarthy. The difference is in the telling. McCarthy's words were beautiful in describing the world around his characters for all it's horrors. The movie could only offer visuals and hope that they did the authors verse justice.<br />As true to the book as the movie appeared, I knew it couldn't offer me the experience of living the words.<br />Good job, but in the end, the book was a better experience.

B0028RXXFC|4.0|I bought this in order to watch the whole series start-to-end and it was worth it. Now, everybody borrows it so I guess I have to wait to see again.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I love this series. I never watched it on TV and decided to purchase Season 1 after my son saw the show on TV. He raved about how good it was and was upset that he did not watch from the beginning. Needless to say after watching Season 1, I purchased Season 2-5. The show just gets better season after season!!!!
B00004WEJZ|2.0|I was a bit disappointed that none of the official 007 box sets contained this movie.  I know, I know, most Bond fanatics do not count NSNA as a \\"real\\" Bond film (and I wouldn't suggest trying to argue otherwise on the Bond Wiki site) but I do.  It uses the James Bond 007 trademark, it stars Sean Connery who is in most opinions THE Bond and the story is based off the Thunderball novel. It is part of all that is Bond, so every true collector should own Never Say Never Again.    Being aware of how horrible the movie was, I never cared to watch it or to seek it out for that matter until I grieved for not owning every Bond film.  I decided once I got the DVD to give it a chance.  Wow, where do I start?  Quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made and by far the worst of any \\"Bond\\" film.    First of all, Sean Connery just looks too old to be playing this part, sorry Sean but the grey only looked good in Red October. Props for being able to work with what you were given though.   Secondly, this in an adaptation of Thunderball, a mediocre film in itself.  There was nothing truly great about Thunderball so why remake it?  Third, Rowan Atkinson always plays a hell of a part in any movie but this one...nu uh. His potrayal of Nigel is more of an interruption than anything.    I could go on and on, but the is no reason to pick apart this movie.  Bottom line, its boring.  There is no spark or magic in it like other Bond films.  The characters are ill-conceived and the plot is the same old SPECTRE crap.  None of the dark Bond or comic relief Bond no Bondness (haha new word) what so ever.  This movie should strictly be something collectors should pick up just to have that one extra piece of Bond.  As far as being watchable, I use it to put myself to sleep now.
B004HD2ZIQ|5.0|You would think that by age 65, Lemmy would slow down...nope!    This is a solid album and sounds very clean like Motorizer.    Stand out songs - Born to Lose,  Get In Line, Outlaw, Brotherhood of Man, Acoustic version of Ace of Spades, I Know How to Die, and Bye Bye Bitch, Bye, Bye.    Just some good, solid rock n roll to drive a car down the highway.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|After all the defending I have done in the past of the HP movies, I think I deserve better.  The books are highly evolved AND involved, way too much content to try and cram into a cluster of a movie.  I thought movies 1-6 were incredibly done and I fought tooth and nail with \\"real\\" fans who thought they were so cool because they had read the books before the movies even came out and would bash everyone who liked the movies because the \\"movies left too much out\\".  But this movie, I will NOT defend in the same way.    Why?  Because it is garbage made with one purpose and that is this: $$$.  Lets see how we can keep our costs low and our earning high.  I thought the purpose of splitting this story into 2 movies was so that it could be exceptionally detailed and leave it all on the floor for the finale.  This is the closer for freaking Harry Potter, both movies could have been 3-4 hours long and people would have never even blinked the whole time!  Don't say you couldn't do more because you didn't have the right time frame.    The entire story is rushed.  Key events are left out (Krum and Harry's talk at the wedding, Kreature's major role, the insight to the Deathly Hallows) or changed, such as the scene with Wormtail.  That was an incredible part in the book, why did we just simply knock him out?!  It seems like the characters are uncomfortable with their lines and just trying to blurt them out as quickly as possible.  My heart was racing for the chase scene in the beginning but that was the most boring pile of crap I've ever seen!  When I read the Deathly Hallows and Hagrid fell from his broom, I was sure he was dead.  Everything pointed that direction, and when he was found to be alive, it was like the 2nd coming to me. But in this movie?  Oh no, lets cut that out so we can put Bill in here saying \\"Hi, my name's Bill, I was attacked by a werewolf\\", no better way of getting some back story than that huh?    I bet Rowling is pissed.  Sources tell me she has a history of being unhappy with the movies, especially for downplaying the elves and after what they did to Kreature I'm sure she'd like to come down with the hammer of the gods.  Please I beg you before watching this, if you have not read the books READ THEM so people like me aren't having to sit there with a whole group of people and explain every freaking detail because the POS movie left out most every important fact that you need to know!      Someone answer me this question, who was the cool looking snatcher guy with the long hair?  See, I read the book and I don't even know who that is!  Can someone please PLEASE reboot this movie?  Hell we are redoing Spider-Man, why not give a little more forethought into a work of literature that has pretty much been a major history mark for a generation?    Did this movie really not deserve a little more thought and time?  Did we really have to rush it?  I will say that yes, there is a lot of downtime in the book that wouldn't have been interesting enough for movie scenes but come on!!! Part 2 better be the best movie ever made or then I will know for a FACT these movies were made with the all mighty dollar sign in eyes and I will forever lose faith in novel adaptations.    This movie is OK for people who haven't read the books but I think even Potter fans that have never read a book in their life will notice this just isn't up to par.  I'm buying it simply to finish out my collection.  I give this movie 2 fingers WAY WAY up.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great read. mcdougall's writing draws you in the way a good friend with magnetic storytelling skills can captivate an entire room. i felt that i not only learned so much about running, science, and history, I felt myself amused by and drawn into the events and people he wrote about. i will recommend this book to everyone.
B0015UKX7Y|5.0|I love this CD, a nice collab of the arctic monkeys and le strokes. I love both of these artists, and when they are combined to make a new CD, it was genious! It has up-beat lyrics, and will make you want to sing a long. I would reccomend this to people that love either the arctic monkeys, or the strokes :D
B0041EVYVK|4.0|I have not seen the live videos which apparently parse the music and sounds to be more audibly digestible.  Nevertheless I am thoroughly enjoying this album and I do not consider it to be over produced.  I like the intensity of Trixie Whitley's vocals, particularly on the track Surely.  I hope Daniel keeps this group together, tour and that they record again. It is a step away from the slower ambient sounds of previous Lanois albums and a wonderful addition to his catalog.

B000HLDFK4|4.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 'BLU RAY' VERSION ***<br /><br />PRINT/EXTRAS:<br />1080p High Definition Print in 16 x 9 - 2.4:1 Aspect Ratio (will fill your screen without too much stretching)<br />There's \\"Additional Scenes And Outtakes\\" as a bonus and a \\"Theatrical Trailer\\"<br /><br />AUDIO:<br />Dolby Digital English 5.1, French 5.1, German 5.1 and English 2.0 Audio Descriptive Service<br /><br />SUBTITLES:<br />English, French and German<br /><br />I had \\"The Lake House\\" on the now defunct HD-DVD format to have Alejandro Agresti's gently persuasive film in High Definition - and it looked beautiful.<br />This Blu Ray is the exactly the same - right down to how the menus are laid out - and there's a superbly clear print also.<br /><br />Some people have said Keanu can't act for snitz (he plays frustrated architect and suburban home-builder Alex Wyler), but I don't know if that actually matters here, because his quite effortless charm carries it off very nicely indeed. Sandra Bullock is beautifully measured as Kate Forster, the caring, intelligent, but lonely doctor who is new in town and a bit out of sorts with the world (there is a believable chemistry between them).<br /><br />The support roles are nicely fleshed out too - the ever-accomplished Christopher Plummer is superb as Keanu's distant and overly-precise architect dad (who built \\"The Lake House\\") and the deeply beautiful Iranian actress Shoreh Aghdashloo plays Anna the head of ward in Kate's hospital. The boss/doctor relationship between them is deftly handled - both in the work scenes, in the lunch-breaks and in the bars after work...<br /><br />People have also poo-pooed the 'letters across time' storyline of Kate in 2006 and Alex in 2004, but I found it refreshing and a very clever angle in a romantic film that takes its time - and savours the lovely moments rather than squander them.<br /><br />\\"The Lake House\\" is a nice watch - and the Blu Ray print adds hugely to the cityscapes of downtown Chicago and the out-of-state location shots too. It may be a little too pat in places and even sedate for some - but I liked it - and thoroughly enjoyed watching it again.<br /><br />And not a black leather suit, bug coming out of your navel or bendy bullet in sight...<br /><br />Recommended.even sedate for some - but I liked it - and thoroughly enjoyed watching it again.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this DVD so that I can workout at home on the days that I don't go to spinning class.  I needed something that was quick and effective.  I consider myself to be in decent shape. This workout kicked my butt and I only did Level 1.  I couldn't walk for 2 days after my first time.  She works your entire body in a short amount of time.  I love the video and highly recommend this one if you are looking for a good, quick workout to do at home.

B003L77GVK|5.0|I was a fan of both previous Stargate series but SGU has been the best of the three, in my opinion.  I have become totally involved with the characters and storylines.  It is a more mature, realistic program and the writing and acting are a step above the rest(not that there was anything lacking in the others, SGU is just exceptional).  Don't get me wrong, I love aliens and spaceships and there have been fewer on SGU than SG1 and SGA but they were absolutely worth waiting for. Amazing and intense!  So, of course, SGU has been cancelled.  After showing the second half of season 2 this spring it will be over.  What a waste!  To have such a wonderful weekly experience shot out of the sky way before its time is so sad.  I am looking forward to watching the last ten episodes and will order the Series 2 dvd as soon as it is available.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Pros:<br /><br />1. Simple rules<br />2. Colorful design and presentation<br />3. Quality construction<br />4. Good game length (15-20 minutes, in my experience)<br />5. Sufficient complexity to maintain interest<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />None, unless one includes the possibility of losing repeatedly to opponents who don't mind rubbing it in.  Also, it's important to keep track of the little plastic pieces, returning them to their individual storage packets when finished playing.
3822856282|5.0|Posted 02/08/11: Given the camera equipment needed to photograph themselves, the women in this book did just that. They used everything form mirrors to timed exposures to get beautiful photos of themselves. Some are very creative, some not so much but all are interesting and worth looking at. This is worth keeping around as a coffee table book at the least. The female form is on display within the pages in a wonderful way.

0802130208|4.0|The misadventures of Ignatius J. Reilly are humorously detailed in this novel.  Many readers will find Ignatius so repugnant and the black humor of this story so off-putting that they won't enjoy the book.  Why do people need to relate to, or feel some compassion for a main character?  A good villain or entertaining ignoramus can be just as fulfilling to base a book around.  I found Ignatius' smug arrogance and superiority complex so amusingly funny that I read this book rather rapidly.  Ignatius is a pathetic human being who lives with his mom and can't hold down a job.  But to hear him tell it, the world can't handle the genius that is Ignatius.  He is full of excuses about how his delicate sensibilities prevent him from succeeding and besides he wouldn't want to succeed in such a depraved culture.  But Ignatius loves to torture himself by delving in to this indecent society.  One of his favorite past-times is to go to horrible movies and shout, \\"oh my god\\" with disgust at the movie.  But he can't stay away.  The humor of such a pathetic character who feels that he is superior to the world is what keeps this book ticking.
B003FSTN6Q|4.0|This has been my favorite show for some time now, but if they'd only known that this was the last season of the show before the network cancelled it, they could have finalized alot of things and tied things up neatly before the series ended.      I was really hoping for Andrea to come back in Melinda's dreams or visions, watching over Aiden maybe.....or maybe have Professor Payne return...possibly as a ghost (I never could figure out why even though they were such great friends, he takes off on sabbatical and nobody ever sees or hears from him again, let alone mentions his existence).  I also hoped that some of the people Melinda helped in the past (living and dead) would make a reappearance in the final season.  But sadly, they didn't know the show was going to be cancelled.    I did enjoy this season and i do recommend it to any fans of the show.  However, it did take a little while to get used to the \\"skip ahead 5 years\\" thing.  Like suddenly Sam Lukas is back to being called \\"Jim\\", he's a doctor, and other things that were kind of jarring at first.  Still, this was an excellent series, and Season 5 is a must-have for any Ghost Whisperer fan.
0800141660|5.0|I found myself in the mood for both a classic \\"chick flick\\" and a visual introduction to the novels of Jane Austen; so I rented this movie to watch with my fiancee. She enjoyed it, but I think I liked it a lot more. I'm old enough now that I can enjoy movies like this, but I certainly would not have appreciated or enjoyed it 10 years ago when still in my late teens.<br /><br />If you are a man looking for a reason to watch this movie, here's one. It stars 3 people who later became Harry Potter professors: Emma Thompson (amazing actress who played Professor Trelawny and also co-starred with Will Ferrell in [[ASIN:B000LXH0AE Stranger Than Fiction]]), Alan Rickman (Professor Snape who is famous for playing villains in [[ASIN:B000O77SRC Die Hard]] and [[ASIN:B00005LOL0 Quigley Down Under]] - it is weird seeing him in this unusal good guy role), and the woman who plays Professor Delores Umbridge, whom we all love to hate in the Harry Potter movies. Also there is a small role for Dr House before he was [[ASIN:B0009WPM1Q House, M.D.: Season One]], cranky even then because his character was married to Delores Umbridge! And in case you are worried about watching this movie because you hate Hugh Grant from his typical clean-cut British loverboy roles like [[ASIN:B000059HAL Nine Months]], don't worry about it. He still plays a clean-cut British loverboy in this movie, but he is actually sort of likeable here. It also stars Kate Winslet from [[ASIN:B00005JMJG Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (Widescreen Edition)]].<br /><br />I am not going to get into the plot of this movie because you can find that anywhere. Suffice it to say that I enjoyed this movie so much that now I want to read Jane Austen's books.

0307454541|5.0|The purpose of a great fiction book is to take the reader away from the everyday realities of life and immerse them in other people's lives ... and all of this has to be done in a well-paced, interesting, plot-twisting and believeable way. Stieg Larsson does it all. After reading this book in two days, I quickly read his other two books and closed the last page with the sad knowledge that I would never read anything by this talented story-teller again. Great fiction that I would highly reccommend. Kudos to you Stieg, wherever you are right now my friend.

The wrist strap is a nice feature because I can have my camera ready to take pictures without having to hold it in my hand all the time. The included belt loop is also nice because it lets you attach and remove the camera case from your belt quickly and easily. I love the little zippered pocket that's included. I put cash and memory cards in it. The case holds my camera nicely and the padding protects it well.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|This was a surprise, it was like attending the show, and it was a feelgood event, everyone was enjoying themselves and with the camera in and out of the audience, brings me closer to the whole event.  Didn't know some of the songs, but that's fine it was and is great - it's good.  And the other two are on the stage doing the usual..

0802798225|5.0|Words can not describe how much I loved this book. I originally drew back from reading it due to the hype surrounding it, in my own personal experience books like that just tend to be a let down. And that was pretty much what I was expecting when I cracked open \\"Perfect Chemistry\\". Thankfully, I was proven wrong.    It's the good ole' classic \\"bad boy meets good girl = true love\\" story but with a feisty twist. I absolutely fell in love with the leading male, Alex Fuentes. He was tough as nails, surprisingly intelligent, sexy, witty and playful but with a definite dangerous edge. He was believable and untouchable at the same time.     The heroine, Brittany, steps out of the bland cookie cutter YA heroine traits (shy, plain, but with a hidden talent/intelligence that surpasses everyone around her) and offers a refreshing well developed, you know, actually personality. She can at times be a little annoying, but its her fundamentally human flaws that make her so and its done purposefully.     The narrative switches POVs, which can either be genius or disastrous. Fortunately here it is definitely the former. It happens at exactly the right places and as seamlessly as possible.    The secondary characters are equally engaging. From Alex's brave and loyal friends Paco and Isa to Brittany's lovable big sister. And of course, the geeky grand theft auto king, Gary Frankel (who quite honestly I think deserves his own book. I could have done with a lot more of him!)    The gang aspect was a little foreign to me so I can't say if its a realistic portrayal or not but personally I found it very interesting. Likewise with the class/race issues faced between the two. The author handels both very well, they are focused on but not obsessed over. The whole plot was just flawlessly executed, I can honestly say that I wouldn't change a single scene. My only frustration is I now feel the desperate need for a sexy guy to call me 'mamacita'.       I will say that the ending (the epilogue more specifically) is very...well, cheesy. I'm not the type of person who normally has to have my books end in picture perfect tied up little bows BUT for this story I found it surprisingly charming. It fit somehow, however I'm sure it will annoy some people so I felt the need to mention it even thought it didn't both me personally.     This is definitely a book I can see myself re-reading over and over again. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a steamy and sweet teen romance.    Note: There is a \\"sequel\\" about Alex's little brother, Carlos, titled 'Rules of Attraction'. And there is always a third coming out about the youngest Fuentes brother (titled 'Chain Reaction') in May 2011. Obviously I have not yet read the latter but I highly recomment 'Rules of Attraction' to anyone who enjoyed 'Perfect Chemistry'.
0670018651|4.0|This book is a perfume guide with very creative entries. The book \\"Emperor of Scent\\" and \\"The Secret of Scent\\" each set the stage for this guide by Lucas Turin and Tania Sanchez. This is a good guide on its own, but reading the other books will make it great!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Love the knife thickness, durability, and I think it is a better \\"survival\\" knife than the BK9 or any of the Gerbers-Prodigy, Gator or LMFII for these reasons. It certainly is the best KABAR/Becker I have ever had. It is thick enough .250\\" to chop wood, sharp enough to shave hair, heavy enough (1095 Carbon-14.6oz.) to conserve your energy and do some of the work for you, and small enough (5.25\\"/10.95\\") to be carried for long distance hiking without being a pain, literally. The sheath is solid but fits the knife a little too tightly, in my opinion. I just ordered a spare one of these puppies and highly recommend this knife-you will NOT be disappointed.
0307277453|5.0|'Your Inner Fish' is a truly humbling, and yet inspiring book. It details how our body came to be. This book isn't written to defend the Theory of Evolution, though I imagine it could have that effect.     From fish scales to teeth. From segmented worms to spinal cords. Shubin reveals the historical legacy of the human body to anyone who is willing to listen. His work will open your eyes and help you to see your body in a new and illuminating way.     PROS:    -Writing: Shubin takes you with him on a historic fossil hunt for the remnants of our prehistoric ancestors. Through that magnanimous moment when fish began to take to the land, making you and me possibilities. Complicated subjects are made accessible to all through the use of elucidating metaphors.     - Evidence: Fossils and transitional species are well used to guide us along evolutionary paths that, at first seem impossible.    -consciousness raising: After learning from where our bodies came, you'll be able to answer questions like why do we hiccup and have back pain? If you can name a problem with our bodies, you can bet that it'll have an evolutionary root.     CONS:  -Superfluous Diversions: For such a short book, Neil spends a lot of time on things that are not so important to the theme of the book. Examples include a long explanation of how fossil trips are planned and funded. If the book were longer, these diversions would be enjoyable, but for such a short book, he should have stayed more on topic.     RECOMMENDED FOR:     Anyone who wants to know more about from where we came. Seriously, read this book!
0743297334|5.0|So... Hemingway writes good stuff. I like this novel more than A Farewell to Arms, and about the same as Garden of Eden (except that Garden of Eden has an unwritten ending).
B003ZTQN1I|3.0|The CD itself has great music. But the music is NOT that used in the movie. I was excited to get the duet that was performed in the movie and when the CD arrived, went straight to that particular song and was surprised to find that Faith Hill actually sings the \\"duet\\" alone. So while the songs are actually from the movie, they are not the versions that are performed in the movie. And in my opinion, the versions performed in the movie are what make the songs good.
0385341679|5.0|I read the whole Fever series and just had to have the last book (Shadowfever) before it came out in paperback.  I was not disappointed.  I wish there were more to read.  Karen Moning is an excellent author and I applaud her for the Fever series.
0385341008|5.0|This is one of my favorite books I've ever read. I enjoyed the style, written as letters between the characters, because it gave me a real feel for who they were. For being a post-war story, it was also quite witty and entertaining. It taught me a lot about a different place and time, and made me want to look into the subject matter more. I highly recommend this book.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|This is probably the third or fourth different thermal compound I've used and it is BY FAR the best.  It's a thicker consistency than some other brands I've used which is great because it doesn't spill everywhere, and it doesn't come with a \\"spreader\\" to ensure an even distribution.  I suggest using a piece of plastic or something like a library card to spread it.  The actual tube is quite small, maybe 3 inches, so if you have large hands, it may feel awkward.  Great little product, will definitely use again.
0920668372|2.0|This book left me with nothing but fear and sadness as a child. The idea that I would spurn my mother's love throughout my youth, only to bitterly regret my actions as she lay dying was so upsetting to me that my pre-school teacher had to call my mother because I was repeatedly crying during nap time, when the book's images would come back to haunt me.     As an adult, I can now appreciate that the book is trying to illustrate unconditional love in a metaphorical manner (I don't think we are to believe that the mother literally crawls into her adult son's bed), but as a young child, all I could think was how horribly sad it all seemed. I began to actively fear my mother's death, while vowing never to be like the boy in the story.     I do not at all mean to suggest that children need to be sheltered from the reality of death, but I do think that what they should learn about death should be comforting and free from excessive sentimentality. This unabashedly mawkish tale goes about it all wrong, instilling fear where it should instill peace. While some children may not have a problem with the book, others will not be able to shake it. For a gentler take on life and death, I recommend \\"The Fall of Freddie the Leaf,\\" which achieves profundity without the syrup.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|The \\"Big Lebowski\\" is one of our favorite comedies.  We only buy what we consider \\"classic\\" movies; movies that we know we will watch in the future and never grow old.  Jeff Bridges will forever be the Dude!  The Coen Brothers always seem to know how to make great movies.

B003L20ICO|3.0|From my point of view, the most interesting thing about co-writer and director Lisa Cholodenko's film, \\"The Kids Are All Right\\", was not the movie itself, but instead, the commentary track that accompanied it on home video.  To be perfectly candid, I didn't quite \\"get\\" the movie when I finally watched it after months of reading press releases and interviews and critiques, and I was both disappointed and dismayed by my unexpectedly ambivalent reaction.  The insights shared in Cholodenko's commentary track helped me to pinpoint the sources of my reservations.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I discovered that the things I liked most about the film were generally the result of creative choices made by the people in front of the camera, rather than behind it.  Although none of the characters in the film are truly likable as written, the cast (Annette Bening and Mark Ruffalo in particular) manage to invest their performances with a certain measure of vulnerability and warmth.  Interestingly, Cholodenko credits these performers with bringing special contributions to the film that she had never considered or even imagined; thus it would seem that Bening and Ruffalo managed to rise above both Cholodenko's uneven script and her somewhat haphazard direction.  Julianne Moore, a supremely talented actress, was less successful at fleshing out her character than her co-stars, probably because her role - though pivotal - was less flexible.  Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson as the \\"kids\\" of the title, both turned in highly effective performances.<br /><br />In addition to the inadequacies in the script and direction, the film's cinematography was merely  serviceable, often too harshly bright in the outdoor sequences.  At times the editing often detracted from the story and settings, especially near the beginning of the film.  The film's soundtrack and score, also, seemed disjointed with one spectacular exception - the Joni Mitchell number that Annette Bening sang at Ruffalo's table was the perfect song for that crucial scene.<br /><br />Given the intriguing subject matter and the casting, \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" could - and should - have been an extraordinary, even groundbreaking, film.  Instead, it is merely a good one. That it fails to live up to its full potential is, in the final summation, a loss for the audience that has waited for just such a film to be produced.

1600595871|5.0|I was fortunate to WIN this book as part of a giveaway by Lark Books!  I had just added it to my Amazon wish list, so winning it was perfect.  I have very little experience making books, but have had an interest for some time.  Now that I am exploring new directions in my fiber art, the book making bug is alive again and I can't wait to get started.  The biggest challenge for me will be deciding where to start - so many amazing ideas and multiple examples for the same book style are included.  I especially appreciate the examples of other artists' work shown throughout the book.      Though the title of my review says this book is appropriate for beginner and experienced bookmakers alike, I'll clarify that by saying this book may not be as detailed in instruction as what a beginning crafter/artist might require, though for the diligent or adventurous beginner, willing to experiment to try to figure out some of the instructions, this book will be a great tool to get started.  As another reviewer mentioned, there aren't illustrations for every step of the instructions and some folks learn better with visuals, others with words.  So depending on your learning style, you may need to play around a bit.  Fun though, right?      All that said, I wouldn't let this keep anyone from purchasing the book.  There are MANY book styles included that are straightforward and easy to follow and with that experience, the others will be more easily understood.   I love a book with different degrees of difficulty in project making - AND instructional books that give plenty of room to add to and expand on the ideas provided.  This book is excellent in that regard.      Even with the bit of damage my book received in shipping, I still love it!  (That's saying a lot -I happen to really like keeping the books in my art library clean and pristine.  LOL)  The one thing I do wish the book included was the artist's preferred list for suppliers and resources.  Just to make it easier for folks topurchase materials and get started sooner. :-)    p.s.  Lark gives away a lot of books and free projects.  Here's their site [...] and you can also follow them on Facebook.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I'm not sure if most of you saw this movie back in 2005 or even heard about it, I'm fairly younger (22 yrs old) and I can honestly say that I knew the movie existed but didnt even think to watch it until after I saw \\"The Dark Knight\\".  After watching this, I was seriously impressed, I absolutely loved the dark knight and this movie was the one that started it all, though like a good sequel the dark knight is better in my opinion but if your a batman, DC comic fan or just like great movies in general I definately reccommend viewing this movie!!!  Explosions, non-stop action, good story...I mean what else could you want in a movie!??  Unlike some recent movies this one has very little CGI and the computer generated stuff it does have isnt over the top to the point where its completely unbelievable.   CHECK IT OUT!!! 9.5/10

B003TML0VO|5.0|Don't understand why all the bad reviews. This is definately a great addition to my Santana collection. He shouldn't be stereotyped to only his classic music such as his Abraxas album. He can collaborate with anyone and put his special touch in it and it sounds amazing. I loved all the songs on this cd and he picks just the right vocalist for each song. He's a musical genius in my opinion :)
1584282584|5.0|I also have over 30 hand-picked, very selective, books on photography, but I feel that this is the one that made the most difference in my pictures. Flash photos can be dreadful or delightful enhancers to bring out your subjects appearance without overpowering them. Just using a plain old speedlite  Mr. Niekerk shows you a few tips and camera settings that make a tremendous difference in your photos. He is also a good teacher, he explains simply but thoroughly, and he understands why his pictures come out well and exactly explains the technique, and he is very willing to share. For $20 and some reading you can change your indoor photos from a hit and miss, unsure experience with often mediocre results to consistently flattering, exciting images. Considering how many of us take indoor pictures, this can radically enhance your investment in a DSLR, and add considerably to your satisfaction with your efforts. So I think you should really do yourself and everyone you take pictures of a favor and quickly buy it and read it, and make everyone happy!
B000A7DVR2|5.0|The biggest peice of advice I can give if you really want to enjoy this is to watch it more than once.  It's very easy to see it for the first time and decide you never want to see it again... a mistake I almost made.    It may be tough trying to settle on an opinion of this movie based simply on reviews, as it seems that they are seperated into two basic categories: the dedicated cult-fans, and the Coen Brother followers who just plain hated it and didn't find any humor at all.  It sounds strange, but they're both right in a way.    The Big Lebowski can easily fall into my top ten list, but not as a Coen Brothers film.  Don't misinterpret, as it is very much a Coen Brothers creation, but probably their most unique one.  When I first viewed the film in its entirety, I didn't like it at all.  I had been on a Coen Brothers kick and was busy collecting all of their films for viewing, and this happened to be one of the last of their films that I picked up.  Typically, I had been admiring their work specifically because of their excellent screenwriting.  Every one of their stories seems not only to be perfectly written and paced, but also a break from the traditional 3-act mold that virtually every other film follows, so it is understandable that either you like the Coens or you don't.  This movie is great for a very different reason, though.  The script is filled with their usual quirky unpredictability and ironic musings, but I wouldn't say that the script for Big Lebowski, in and of itself, is a particularly decent work.  In fact, the story is actually pretty pointless and stupid, which was most of what I picked up on during my first viewing.  But the movie is not good because of the script, and that, I think, is what makes The Big Lebowski so much different that it's kin.    This movie is a masterpiece because of the characters, and the performances of said characters.  It is also easily the most quotable film ever.  Jeff Bridges plays his quintessential role as TheDude, a character so well done he managed to spawn an actual religion titled \\"Dudeism\\".  The film is very much an overture to the religion because it offers a very laid back point of view on a greedy world obsessed with material possessions and money.  The Dude more or less casually walks in and out of situations involving thugs, millionaires, sex offenders, pornstars, fascists, and antisemites, all of whom are playing tug of war with a briefcase containing one million dollars (and another one full of dirty undies).  The Dude and his adventures are purely about atmosphere rather than story.  It's a fine example of how every part of a picture, even the seemingly pointless ones put in place only to progress from one part of a story to the next, can be taken advantage of.  The best example of this is probably the Gutterballs sequence, which serves no real purpose other than as a treat in between actual scenes, but it's easily the best scene the movie has to offer.    The film's soundtrack really helps develop the Dude's laid back atmosphere, including tracks by Bob Dylan, Kenny Rogers, and of course, some Creedence tapes.  And for those of you who are drinkers, this is one of the best drinking movies ever, whether you are sipping on an actual White Russian, or relaxing with a few burgers and some beers.  Like most Coen Brothers films, it is difficult to narrow this down to one specific genre.  Comedy seems to be where the movie stores keep it, but it is also a suspense mystery as well as a contemporary western.  For me, it's what I watch when I just want to relax and have a good time.
B003Q6D1Z6|4.0|I just finished watching \\"catfish\\" for the second time, and I was just as fascinated this time as the first -- but I understood it better, as I was more attentive to the details.<br /><br />It was probably a good thing that I watched the film without knowing anything about it, nor had I read any of the trailers.  I was just scrolling through the indie films On Demand and happened upon it.  It sounded interesting, so I watched it.  Then I had to watch it again.  That's when I know a movie really grips me.<br /><br />But I wasn't expecting a horror film, nor would I have watched it if I had.  That is a different genre altogether, with a somewhat different audience.  This film was described as a \\"documentary\\" and, indeed, it had that feel to it, as the camera was jumpy and the characters -- Ariel Schulman, Nev Schulman, director Henry Joost, and the Facebook cast of Abby, Angela, and Vince (we never see the real-life internet love-interest of Nev, Megan, because she doesn't exist)talk and look like ordinary people (although Nev is a very handsome young man).  Ariel Schulman (\\"Rel\\") for whatever reason decides to film his brother's Facebook relationship with the family of 8-year-old genius artist Abby. This relationship gets its start when Nev, who is a photographer and dancer,  receives a painting of one of his photographs in the mail.  Ostensibly, this painting was done by the child Abby.  Nev \\"friends\\" Abby on Facebook, and very quickly her entire family become part of his Facebook \\"family\\".  Her beautiful older sister Megan and Nev begin a flirtacious internet correspondence which quickly gets out of control and very soon they are panting to meet and, presumably, hop into bed together.<br /><br />Much has already been written about the somewhat suspicious way things fall together in the film, perhaps a little too neatly for this to really have been a documentary.  I don't feel that is terribly important.  The message of this captivating film is inescapably human, and says something about the lonely void that the internet fills for some people.  The ending is quite poignant, and I have no reason to believe the facts as stated aren't true.  There are many people out there who, if they have the time and the will to do so, can create a hoax and have even intelligent people like Nev fall for it.  On second watching, I was a little surprised that Nev and Rel didn't question the unbelievable attractiveness of Megan and her friends, and even Angela and Vince, as they appeared on Facebook, but people Photoshop their photographs all the time, so that wasn't really a germaine criticism.<br /><br />The fact that Nev was duped is less important than his (and Rel and even Henry's) reaction to it.  Angela was, and is, one of the saddest characters I have ever seen in a movie, sociopath or not.  And what she pulled off isn't that unbelievable, because there are hoaxes out there that make this seem like child's play.

This can be an entertaining movie at first, but it grows to be rather boring. There are lots of gun fights, explosions, action stars, one-liners and tough guy taunts...so many, in fact, that by time you're half way through, you're ready for it to be over.  Or, maybe it's a guy-thing. Most of the guys I know liked or loved it; most of the girls felt like I did...it was ok at first, but had so little actual storyline that it quickly got old.<br /><br />This was ok once...if you're in the mood for a testosterone overload, go for it (and, botox aside, the cast is more-or-less easy on the eyes...Jet Li and Jason Statham were particularly popular with me and my female friends, and the main character girl [don't know her name] was a hit with the guys). 2/5 stars

B003K72YZ4|5.0|*Non-Spoiler*  I'm not going to lie, the first half of the season... has been rather dull(2 stars dull) and it's my opinion that its taken the two actors a while to find their cohesion.  But here in the \\"Silence in the Library\\" Things really take a positive turn in terms of excitement for the series.  I'm not sure if someone raised the writers salary or if the two actors finally found their center together (probably both) but from this point on in the season, the season gets REALLY good again and right to the end of the season they'll have you riveted and on the edge of your seat like the Dr. Who of old.  It took me a while to work through the first half of the season but I think I may have watched the entire 2nd half in one sitting, couldn't stop clicking NEXT. Heh, enjoy!!
B0000067L2|3.0|Looking at the reviews of this album, it's interesting to note that the vast majority of those who rave about it got into it in the 60s, or roughly at the time it came out. There is always a danger in such a case of not rating something objectively, as the emotional connection often overrides the actual quality of the music. I too feel the same way about some of the albums I grew up with. Now I have all the albums from the name bands of the 60s, and a vast amount of psych, blues and 60s/70s rock in my collection, so although I expect some negative comments on my review, please understand this is not the criticism of a novice, newbie or metalhead.<br /><br />If you're expecting the following, you're going to be very disappointed with this album:<br /><br />(1) Mind-blowing guitar-playing: compare the guitar-playing on this to Hendrix' 'Are You Experienced' (1967) and 'Axis:Bold As Love' (1968), to Johnny Winter's first album recorded in 1968, or Jimmy Page's playing on the first Led Zeppelin album (recorded late '68), and there's a vast, vast difference in the level of guitar-playing. It's like comparing someone reciting the alphabet with someone reading Shakespeare. If you're an electric guitar-player, you may spend years with your guitar, the sheet-music to Axis:Bold As Love, and the album itself without being able to duplicate much of what Hendrix does, especially on the rhythm side. But the advantage of being a Cream fan is that Clapton's licks, solos, and rhythm on this album are well within the reach of any amateur who sets his mind to it. Note that I don't say Clapton can't play well, but ability on this album is downplayed in favour of effects and attempts at psychedelia. Which brings me to the next thing not to expect...<br />(2) Mind-blowing psychedelia: One of the best things about Disraeli Gears is no doubt the album cover, and that alone has led to many mistaken purchases of this album in my experience. Some of these songs are borderline psychedelia, but generally it's more like pop-blues with some psych elements coming from the use of fuzz and wah. Finally, don't expect...<br />(3) Excellent blues: listen to Hendrix' 'Red House' (the original version from Oct 1966 found on the newer versions of 'Are You Experienced' or on the 'Blues' album), or Johnny Winter's 'Be Careful With A Fool' from his first album. As I've stated above, to anyone who knows anything about good guitar-playing, who actually plays themselves, or who've tried to work on songs by these guys and Clapton, there's just no comparison. Winter and Hendrix still make the mouth drop with their playing, while Clapton's playing sounds tired and cliched today, and generally relies on effects on this album.<br /><br />I'm not writing this review to irritate Clapton fans, although that is bound to happen, but I'm also not writing it just to collect positive votes. Instead, if I can warn one person away from a mistaken purchase for every ten who give me a negative vote, then I consider my job done. As a consolation to Eric's fans, let me just say that I recently saw that all-star concert from a couple years ago where he plays live with Stevie Winwood, etc, and was pretty much blown away by Eric's playing. The man can play! And better than he ever did in the 60s! While poor old Johnny Winter can't hold a straw to him now...<br /><br />If you absolutely must have some Cream in your music collection rather go for the old Best of Cream compilation. That has most of the best songs on this album, and you're not forced to listen to the weak tracks like World of Pain or Dance the Night Away, or the embarrassing ones like Blue Condition or Mother's Lament.like pop-blues with some psych elements coming from the use of fuzz and wah. Finally, don't expect...  (3) Excellent blues: listen to Hendrix' 'Red House' (the original version from Oct 1966 found on the newer versions of 'Are You Experienced' or on the 'Blues' album), or Johnny Winter's 'Be Careful With A Fool' from his first album. As I've stated above, to anyone who knows anything about good guitar-playing, who actually plays themselves, or who've tried to work on songs by these guys and Clapton, there's just no comparison. Winter and Hendrix still make the mouth drop with their playing, while Clapton's playing sounds tired and cliched today, and generally relies on effects on this album.     I'm not writing this review to irritate Clapton fans, although that is bound to happen, but I'm also not writing it just to collect positive votes. Instead, if I can warn one person away from a mistaken purchase for every ten who give me a negative vote, then I consider my job done. As a consolation to Eric's fans, let me just say that I recently saw that all-star concert from a couple years ago where he plays live with Stevie Winwood, etc, and was pretty much blown away by Eric's playing. The man can play! And better than he ever did in the 60s! While poor old Johnny Winter can't hold a straw to him now...    If you absolutely must have some Cream in your music collection rather go for the old Best of Cream compilation.

030726999X|2.0|Unless you are writing your thesis on the history of Swedish government, you will want to avoid the first 3/4ths of this novel.  I found it very disappointing, as my favorite character, Lisbeth Salander is absent until the last 1/2 of the book.  She is in ICU recovering from surgery to remove a bullet from her brain.  The books takes off where \\"Fire\\" ended, but unfortunately Blomvist's detailed investigation is much too lengthy and rather boring.  Salander finally comes to life when Blomvist smuggles her Palm into ICU and she begins to restart her hacking career with her old buddies, to assist Blomvist in tracking down all of the suspects for several murders from \\"Fire\\".  As usual, the ending is a hoot, as Salander repeats her amazing physical strengths in surviving the last of the bad guys to be arrested when he comes after her.

B000JBWWQ0|1.0|Sorry but I have to disagree with the above reviews.  While I enjoyed the book I found the film to be a turn off.  While the scenery was nice it didn't come anywhere near to being as good as the actually written story.    It seems to race around everywhere and I felt it combined parts from the 1st book and the 2nd book.      And what was the deal with the \\"Obi-wan Kenobi\\" priest at the end???  I don't recall it being like that in the book.    I'm not against new age but this was really wishy washy and turned my friends off even wanting to read the book.    I know it's about co-incidences but the major one here is that co-incidentally my friends hated it.    Try the book.   It's better value for money.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I was disturbed throughout but i liked it. I started watching it with my 14 yr old daughter but had to stop because of the sexual nature. It's a good thing i didn't let her see the rest...but i watched it all. The music of Tchaikovsky added to the the movie's intensity and drama. A must see...though I'll wait awhile before watching again.
0060775858|5.0|This is a fifteen page book of progressive learning for a toddler that provides the rhyme and rhythm for the rhythm of sleep. Each page is a rhyme or leads to one that introduces a new feature (a green room, three little bears in chairs, and mittens, and kittens), and a new word that is in the picture. Every third page is in color where the child can identify the new object that is in the room. A rabbit is tossing and turning trying to sleep before it finally does.<br /><br />This is very short and much beyond the age of a five year old, but it is perfect as words are being learned for the first time at ages 2 and 3. It is being sent to my great nephew, (the one who got the [[ASIN:B001CW7CVK Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Sea Turtle]] for Christmas).<br /><br />I admit it is even better than \\"Barney Swallows a Whiny Kid and is Shot Dead,\\" a book I wrote thirty years ago for a demonic little child that has yet to be published.<br /><br />Pleasant dreams, David Lysander.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000EUHKUE Uncle Milton Moon In My Room]]
B002ZG99N6|5.0|If you know little about what to expect before you see this film, I suggest you will be surprised on the upside. It's about a crime gone right, then wrong, then right, then... and as the criminals get closer to being caught, they take more chances, sometimes causing them to get deeper in trouble.    Affleck actually is superb here, only rarely seen by him. (But I'm one who gives him credit for nailing Matt Murdoch in Daredevil.)
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I have read both The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons and this book is quite sad in comparison.  Its as if Dan Brown enlisted a ghost writer who only skimmed his other works.  I found myself constantly skipping pages ahead just to maintain interest.  Not to mention the ending is pathetic and honestly a little corny.  Don't waste your time or money.

B004F69J2K|5.0|Import Blu-Ray/Region A pressing. An avowed alcoholic, Ben drank away his family, friends and, finally, his job. With deliberate resolve, he burns the remnants of his life and heads for Las Vegas to end it all in one final binge. On the strip, Ben picks up a street-smart hooker named Sera in what might have been another excess in his self-destructive jag. Instead their chance meeting becomes a respite on the road to oblivion as something connects between these two disenfranchised souls.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|When I started to view the end of the Second Season on TV, it brought back hours of reading Terry Goodkinds books many years ago, with more than 10 titles, I never did get to the end.  Hence I was delighted tor order the First Season.  Only a pity the TV network decided against producing further adventures beyond Season Two.  The First Series basically introduces the characters to each other and confirms their quest is to save the human world.  The fight between Good and Evil prevails.  The story line is packed with adventure, it's during season one that we discover and learn about the characteristic, traits and mystical powers of the lead characters.  You will lose a lot of meaningfully information bouncing directly into Season Two without watching Season one first. The film was shot in New Zealand which provides for beautiful backdrops of green rolling hills, pristine beaches and lush forests, just the place to re-create magic.  The actors are wonderful, but definity grew into their roles as the series developed.  So if you a person who likes to escape into a fantasy world of wizards and witches, good against dark forces, then this Series with entice you watch from one episode to the next. Lastly I would like to thank Amazon for trying to outsource both Series one and Series Two for me.   It took a little longer to get them, but Amazon did manage to deliver when my local supplier could not.
B00445JSX2|5.0|The band is awesome! David Gahan, Martin Gore and Andrew Fletcher are at their best and stage presentation is mind blowing.  This concert dvd/cd set is a definite must for any devout Depeche Mode fan! Buy it as soon as you read this! I cannot get enough of it. Second dvd in the set lets you look at the inner workings of the band and the trials and tribulations they have  gone through to make their career a successful journey for all sincere fans to follow. I am still mesmerized by entire set of  songs and concert presentation.  Depeche Mode is my favorite band and thanks to David and Martin, I have developed a unique voice that one day will be noticed. The entire band is definitely a musical wonder to behold!!    Jerod Steele - Singer  2/8/11
B003Q6D2B4|1.0|This is an insult, it really is.  If there was no DVD of Red out there, and no special edition with everything, then ok, maybe they get away with this.  But to deliberately put out this hacked version and not make it PAINFULLY OBVIOUS what you are getting...that is just low.  I have no problem with the idea of having tiered levels of pricing for what you get (though I have to question the wisdom for everybody of having say, 3 different Blu Ray sku's for toy story 3), and even lo-res audio would be ok if it is CLEAR what you are getting...if you were being given an informed choice. And if the ONLY difference was audio, then you'd make an informed decision vs. the special edition, but no, it appears that its the other stuff that differentiates the two versions. It's just obviously and intentionally deceptive.  My goodness, people who opt for Blu-Ray vs DVD want the whole deal for crying out loud...deceptive I tell ya!
B004HAG40O|2.0|To echo another reviewer on Amazon (who gave this album five stars), the \\"King is Dead\\" reminds me why I loved the last two Decemberists releases so much.  Why? Because I love ten minute songs that some would dare call suites.  I love convoluted concept albums about talking deer and evil Queens and the ghost of dead children haunting a rakish villain.  I love 18th century references and eastern myths turned into three part epics and hearing words I would never hear in any other song from any other band.  I love bands that indulge their every whim and deliver the album they want to make, darn the consequences.<br />  Listening to this, I don't hear any of the above.  Yes, the lyrics are still some of the smartest around, but in this case, the intelligence is a by-product of the lyricist's vocabulary, not an intentional swing for the literary bleachers.  If I had to describe this album, I would call it \\"folk country with a slightly mythical tinge\\", which really means nothing other than the fact that it's mostly acoustic, mostly mid-tempo, and mostly about melancholy days and melancholy love.  Even the potentially intriguing \\"Calamity Song\\"- ooh, what calamity?- is about a dream.  Sigh.<br />  This album never comes close to rocking, and I must admit, I love when the Decemberists rock out.  Every time the Queen showed up on \\"Hazards of Love\\"? I got chills; and I get giddy when I hear their King-Crimson slosh stomp on \\"The Island\\".<br />  This album calmed me, soothed me, put me to sleep.  For what it is- acoustic folk pop songs- it is good.  That is not what I wanted from this band at this point, however, so I am disappointed.  You may love it, I don't know.  Be warned, however, if you are expecting anything similar to the last two albums.
B003UBTX7C|1.0|Why is the Kindle price higher than the paperback price? Makes no sense! Starting to sound more like the Nook than the Kindle!
B004132I4S|5.0|I was not initially convinced by this new direction and at first agreed with what others have described as a \\"self-indulgent\\" album. However, upon repeated listening and having just seen him live, I'm compelled to say that this is definitely a five star album and that Sufjan Stevens is an incredible musician, performer and persona.    The problem with a lot of reviews here is that they reveal how expectation coupled with personal taste combine to make people unnecessarily derisive: If you love contemporary folk music and loved his other albums ('Enjoy Your Rabbit' an obvious exception, but a real indication that 'The Age of Adz' was always on the cards) then this album will no doubt disappoint you and you should avoid it. So unfortunately a lot of the negative reviews are from self-described fans who have blindly bought this album expecting lilting folk songs and then found something far too avant-garde for their taste!    However, if you are into a broad range of music (and do like multi-layered electronica) then definitely give this album a listen. There is a mix of funk, dance and electro-pop coupled with Sufjan's patented folk singing (and orchestral highs and lows) that make it quite unique. And that's what makes this such a long-term album: there is a lot that unfolds over many listens... so not an easy quick-fix, lovely-listen like his previous albums. You'll need to give it time if you are prepared to follow his move toward what I now think is an exciting direction.    I would say this is similar to Radiohead putting out 'Kid A' and losing all their so-called 'The Bends' and 'OK Computer' fans. People who were never really open-minded enough to understand that what makes these musicians so good is their desire to progress and experiment rather than churn out the same old, same old. They require their audience to be a little more adventurous and to listen and understand a more broad range of music as they themselves do.    IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO SEE THIS ALBUM PERFORMED LIVE IT WILL MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE! A BRILLIANT SHOW!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Ms. Grandin is a success story for us autistics; I applaud her struggles & ultimate achievements.  The movie seems to hit on key issues without much depth; Claire Danes I think over-acts the autism, which I found embarrassing.  I  still enjoyed the movie very much.    I do find fault with the telling of Ms. Grandin's story on autism as the ONLY story about autistics; we have different issues, mannerisms, phobias....  That should have been made more clear.  That she succeeded in life does not mean all autistics will:  I for one, did not, and it is too late for me.  Still, a very good story about ONE autistic.  I would actually like to see a followup feature on her life, and including other autistics for a rounder portrait.
0545265355|5.0|I purchased this book set for my 14 year old son who was enjoying the first book in school. He expressed an interest in continuing the trilogy on his own and I ordered the set for him to complete. He is enjoying the books very much.

B004DK5CW4|4.0|Gotta love Secretariat!  Whadda horse!  I saw all three races in the 70's and it was awesome first time around.  Awesome watching the movie too.    The characters are stilted & predicatable & pretty forgettable....except for Penney.  The kids in her family don't seem to age very much despite the chronological progression.  How neat is that.    It's too bad the horse's dam doesn't get more kudos for his successes, all I hear is Bold Ruler this, Bold Ruler that, and from what I've read, he wasn't that great.    Phrases like \\"in foal\\" not \\"pregnant.\\"  And it's a \\"boy\\"....no.  It's a stud colt.  That's horseman lingo.  >cringe<    The race at Belmont is thrilling, but then comes this \\"O Happy Day\\" music???  Religious overtones, notching Secreteriat to the level of a deity?  I think not.  Please.  Just a horse who ran incredible races.    Very interesting biopic on this horse, but no need to give him a halo.
B000BB1MI2|1.0|Is anyone else catching on that Freddie Highmore is always playing the role of some poor, down-on-his-luck kid, whose life sucks bigtime, but he is always happy and cheerful? Here is how th intro to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory should have gone:    Charlie goes to school. Out in the courtyard are about 20 bullies waiting for him. When Charlie arrives the bullies say \\"Hey there he is. Let's get 'em\\". A couple of bullies hold his arms back, and spread his legs apart. Then the remainding bullies line up to each give Charlie a swift kick in the jimmie. The camera starts off on the first kicker as his leg goes back, and quickly zooms in and pans up to Charlies face. You don't actually see the kicks, but you hear them, and you see Charlie shake. With each kick Freddie Highmore is making his stupid half-smile, and saying in a soft-British accent \\"That's wonderful\\".    The next scene Charlie comes home from school, walking bow legged through the door. \\"How was school?\\" ask Charlie's mom. \\"It was absolutely marvelous\\" says a resilient Charlie as he shoves an icepack down his pants. Well anyway go clean up for your Birthday party.    The next scene Charlie is blowing out the candles on his cake, when his mom says \\"Oh Charlie, we have a surprise for you.\\" She pulls back a blanket and reveals a piniatta and about 20 baseball bats. \\"We invited some of your friends from school over to play break the piniatta with\\". Walking through the door are the same 20 bullies from school. As they walk in the house, the camera pans in on Charlie as he is silent, but has that same stupid half-smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, as if his face is suggesting that he's thinking \\"This is great\\". \\"We'll just leave you boys alone to have some fun\\" says Charlie's parents as they leave the room.    The bullies now have Charlie held down again, as they are taking turns hitting him in the jimmy with baseball bats. Once again we don't see the hits, as the camera has panned to the outside ofthe house. But every few seconds we hear a thump sound, followed by a \\"That's Scrumdiddlyumtpious\\" and \\" Hit me in my Wonkar Bar one more time\\" from Charlie.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|This film is quite primative, but it still stands up as a very well-made classic. So many people will pigeon-hole any old, crudely-made film as a \\"classic,\\" but this is such a case where a really old film truly is \\"classic.\\"<br /><br />It is one of the best morality tales out there, showing clearly what can happen when you put the almighty dollar above all else. The \\"Eighth Wonder Of The World\\" is captured after being subdued with gas bombs, delivered to New York City, and further degraded by being restrained to what can only be described as a torture rack. If this story were true, people don't realize just how terrified this poor creature was. Yes, life on Skull Island was tough, a daily struggle for survival, but at least he was in his element. Suddenly here he is, in an alien environment, with hordes of people gathered to gawk at him. Flash photography is the same to a wild beast as lightning. If you have ever owned a dog, you know what happens during one of these storms; in this scenario it's a disaster waiting to happen. It's one of the great tragedies. Pretty sad, really.<br /><br />Despite the crude stop-motion animation, paying attention to King Kong's performance in this film, one sees a remarkable job on the part of the special effects crew. His face is more expressive in many scenes than a lot of talented actors. When he first sees Ann (Fay Wray), he is intrigued. She's a very pretty young woman, and he likes what he sees. And despite this giant beast being, in reality, a movie prop, he delivers a quite sensitive performance. He cares for her, he protects her, and will go right through anyone or anything that he thinks will take her from him. He takes her and climbs the Empire State Building to get away from everyone who has been hounding him; he just wants to be left alone. And the planes gun him down as he tries to escape from these people who are actually scaring him to death. People really suck, they just can't leave things alone.<br /><br />I'm sure there are many people who will prefer the Peter Jackson version of this story, and that's fine. But this time-piece from 1933 is every bit of an achievement as that one or any other film.o will prefer the Peter Jackson version of this story, and that's fine.

B00005JXY3|1.0|So the 1st KK is a classic. All about real issues that a teenager can relate too: moving, deceased loved one, relationships, getting picked on, rising up to bullies, being mentored by older person, etc...All very real stuff. It feels like it fits in with all the other classic 80s films. The only thing unrealistic is the fact that Daniel masters the art of karate in about 4 weeks.    Then they made KK2, and I was like \\"WTF\\". The basis for the movie should have been that Daniel and Ally were still together, all of the old Cobra Kai members are now Daniel's friends and train with Mr. Myuigi, and Kreese is out for revenge. It would have shown the rewards of Daniel doing the right thing in the first film, and motivate young people to keep doing the right thing despite oppostion.    But No. Instead Ally, the deap, complex, real character from the first film gets reduced to a dumb bimbo blonde in exactly one line at the begining of the second film, and then they put Daniel in a bunch of situations that NO teenager can relate too.    I highly doubt that any young person has walked away from watching this movie thinking \\"Boy I sure am glad that I have so much in common with Daniel. After all, I too have traveled to a different country with my only friend in life, who ironically is a 70 year old man from Japan, somehow became the key piece right in the middle of a political conflict involving a small town, have had a psychopath threaten to kill me, who coincidentally was the nephew of the psychopath trying to kill my one-and-only 70 year old best friend, and infact fought this psycho in front of a huge crowd at a Japanese Celebration as he tried to kill me. Wow I never knew we had so much in common!\\"    The music is over-the-top big time in this film. It sounds like you are watching an episode of the \\"Young and the Restless\\", with how dramatic the music is trying to be, and it is constantly playing through out the movie.    Also, most of the film is about Danielle and Meeskwogee getting harrased by Sato's hired goons, Jozen and the gang, trying to get Mr.Meyaagee to fight. This film could have been alot shorter had Meeyagee agreed right from the Begining.    What a Stupid Movie.
B00338QENI|5.0|Fascinating and more than a bit maddening at times, this book touches on all sorts of topics--race, medical ethics, patient's rights, scientific research. Don't let the science part scare you. This is really a book about the woman, her family and their struggles not just HeLa cells.
0312945973|5.0|One of the small pleasures of traveling around so much is to find local writers/books/movies that I wouldn't know otherwise.  Wilbur Smith is the name I never noticed before,although I am life-long bookshop browser. Perhaps I was looking in the wrong direction or simply didn't know him,I clearly remember last year in South Africa checking out his novels in bookshops and thinking \\"hm,this sounds interesting\\" but this time I decided to give him a try. Boy,was it worth it.    \\"The River God\\" is his famous first (of many) books set in ancient Egypt and its a beautiful never-ending saga in full MGM splendor,with lots of chariot races,wild beast hunting, royal palace intrigues,travels on the Nile and so on - the main character is eunuch called Taita who is all-knowing force behind the throne and he gradually becomes more and more indispensable to royals with his wisdom and knowledge. The period is very well researched and it gives the reader almost the smell of the places,also noticeable is the author attempt to present the story from ancient Egyptian point of view,for example locals initial mistrust to arrival of new,unknown animals (horses) for whom they believe they are man-eaters. The novel was much better than I expected and it was a perfect escapism,I could hardly wait to finish my work and dive into world of old Egypt.  Luckily this novel was just beginning of several ancient Egypt novels with the same characters so now I know where to follow.
B004EK91LQ|3.0|The story line was over emphasized in this. I could understand it if the plot was original, but it was your basic \\"love, betrayal\\" line with the cookie side kick.    in a lot of places, i felt like the the main character who owned the dance building was screwing over Moose repeatedly just because he only cared for himself. Moose was awesome, as always, but there simply was too much useless dialogue and romance BS you see in every other movie. The end dance was the best, of course. The dance scenes were short though... Step up 2 was and is the best of the step ups, in my opinion.         still: LXD. WATCH the Leasgue of Extraordinary Dancers - now THAT is pure DANCE with just enough story to keep it going and keep it moving and flowing through each episode. They have the LXD movie available on amazon for like, 11.99 dollars : D i can't wait 'till it arrives. (this is relevant because the producer of step up 2 and 3 made LXD -which you can watch the first season for free on hulu.com )
B002JVWR4A|5.0|This fifth season is the saddest of them all because it has to bring the series to an end, though it will have to keep some door open for further reviving. We know from the very first episode that it is going to be so, that we are going to move to a close.<br /><br />The main change is in tone. The various episodes are centered on the personal dimensions of the various characters. Personal remarks and personal details are more important than the crimes under scrutiny and the lab discussions are some kind of permanent interweaving of small talk about personal matters and the real business at hand that is in many ways kept at a respectable distance. It is not even rare that someone has to call the lab back to order, i.e. to work. And the cases are often slightly superficial and the conclusion hasty.<br /><br />Then all current business has to be dealt with. First Angela and Dr Hodgins will finally manage to get married but that will have to be under duress, and I must say that was a good punishment for them two. That poor Angela even created a panic with her pregnancy test. Pregnant? Yes, you'll have to find out and from whom.<br /><br />Then a touch of nostalgia with the first case on which Booth and Bones worked together, a long time ago. That brings Zack back into the picture for a short cameo. A sorry case and yet quite a case that made Dr Brennan punch a federal judge in the nose twice.<br /><br />Then we have to deal with the little personnel, those laboratory people who are only interns and live on precarious scholarships. By the way it reveals how these younger people have it a little difficult in life, getting from one job to another, being an intern for some pittance, etc. This should be a good lesson to those who believe a scientist is at the top two years after his or her PhD. That is absolutely false for one and for two it takes many years of precarious and low-paid jobs while doing their primary research for their PhDs.<br /><br />Then small little bits of business concerning Dr Saroyan who finds a good date in the gynecologist of her own daughter. Daisy Wick will go on a one year mission in Indonesia on Dr Brennan's reference. Dr Sweets will stay behind and will be slightly abandoned.<br /><br />The main changes are of course for Dr Brennan and Special Agent Booth. But that, you will have to find out all by yourselves. You must be big boys and bog girls after all.<br /><br />On the other hand the Gravedigger is finally brought to trial and convicted. The main witnesses and testifying experts are the very victims of that gravedigger, Booth, Hodgins, Montenegro and Brennan, which is a difficult situation in front of a jury: you have to convince the jury that your evidence comes from your expertise and not from your desire of vengeance.<br /><br />Then a little tidbit here and another little tidbit there and we are at the end of the season and the sad departure of everyone to the four corners of the globe, if the globe has four corners. The team is down. What will happen then? We of course know there is a sixth season going on right now, but that will change the general outlook. They may even bring in some fresh air, and the last case was a typical case of a completely locked up hoarder's den or lair with fans to move the air around. Five years is a long time for a series.

B004M3H17Q|5.0|James Blake is a precocious talent and arrived with a large splash following his stunning cover of Feist's beautifully elegiac \\"Limit to your love\\" included here in all its slow burning glory. As an artist he is a disciple of the \\"less is more\\" school with this debut album characterized by a predominant sparsity in certain songs often stripping out layers of instrumentation in favour of voice, bass loops and synth (and in the case of Lindisfarne 1 a straight vocoderised acappella)<br /><br />The album soulful opener \\"Unluck\\" does remind of Bon Iver's \\"Woods\\" from last years \\"Blood Bank EP\\" with its use of vocoder style vocals but ultimately differs with its deep clicks and an minimalist intensity. It is followed by \\"Wilhelm's scream\\" a song that has been distributed freely on music blogs and one that has spent so much time on my PC speakers it could claim squatting rights. The huge debt, which Blake owes to dubstep, is revealed and builds to a digital intensity around the continual refrain of the lines \\"I don't know about my love anymore/all I know is I'm falling\\". This should be the starting point for the curious listener. \\"I never learned to share\\" is again based around a repetitive lyric but with all sort of electronic shenanigans going on in the background almost suggesting a church like ambience.<br /><br />Blake's debut is often an introspective and moody piece of work, which can make The XX look like the Beach Boys in the fun stakes. But this is not a criticism; with some songs drifting along at a snails pace it can lead you to think that they may have finished, yet it gives the album a Sinatra like \\"wee small hours\\" quality. This will mean that Blake's debut will primarily be a late night feast. It is an album, which evolves through its slow revealing beats, and has a deeply intricate core based around sonic landscapes and truly extraordinary songs. The glacial \\"To care (like you)\\" is a duet that feels that Blake is just about keeping the ball rolling. Yet with its beautiful quivering auto tuning and double micro beats it is a stellar highlight.

There are also echoes here of great artists such as Lewis Taylor, David Sylvain, Anthony Hegarty, Burial and Panthu de Prince (the towering \\"I mind\\" would have sat beautifully on his recent \\"Black Noise\\" album\\"). I wager that Blake's debut will be a true Marmite album loved by some despised by others, thus a warning - if you seek music pumped full of adrenalin and sweaty excitement avoid this like the plague. On the other hand if you want an album by an artist taking on board and developing a range of influences, trying to do something different with them and largely succeeding then this if for you. Blake has created a template for new music in 2011 with this startling debut and for once the BBC New Year predictions turn out to bang on.ful quivering auto tuning and double micro beats it is a stellar highlight.

B0046MOVD0|4.0|I have really enjoyed the Resident Evil films even though they deviated from the video games some. I like that they bring the people and the creatures from the games into the movies. This fourth outing things change for Alice. She meets back up with Claire Redfield and later on reunites her with her brother Chris Redfield while trying to find safe haven from the infection of the T-Virus. She faces new enemies in her quest to stop Wesker. Lots of neat fight scenes and really well played action scenes. I look forward to Paul Anderson's next movie when it comes out. One last thing keep watching during the credits for another scene. One of Alice's friend's comes back(Jill Valentine from RE:Apocalypse playerd by Sienna Guillory) but now she works for Wesker. I missed this scene at the theaters by literally 10 seconds when I walked out. Enjoy this film, I really did.
B003SHYVO8|5.0|I'm not a dancer. I'm a kick boxer and a strength-endurance hobbiest, and i can appreciate the concentration required for alot of those moves. The dances they perform, especially at the end in the final dance off is just beyond mind boggling. Entirely inspiring from someone who has trained  minimally compared to them! John Chu keeps making movies with the greatest dancers around - including the least expected people. Moose, for example, is my favorite out of this entire show. He threw off my expectations entirely, tying the group together with his own pulse.    a movie with it's own texture - pure awesome : D
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I bought the DVD, and have had it less than a week, and have viewed the movie 3 times already. I can not count how many times I have viewed the features selections. A truly moving, sensual, chemistry filled, erotic, love story between two women. The Director, Nicole Conn, and Producer, Marina Rice Bader have made one of the best lesbian love stories I have ever seen. The casting of the two main characters could not have been better. The chemistry between the two lead characters is unbelievable, and so real. This movie speaks to all lesbians, who find their true sexuality later in life. Not knowing who they are in their teens, and twenties, do what is expected, and date boys/young men, and marry young. Then something happens, and you meet someone who makes your heart race,  your hands sweat, and you can not catch your breath. It's a feeling you have never experienced with a man. You realize that your in love for the very first time. This movie is of a woman who falls into this category. Married, with a child, and just going through the motions of life. Not really feeling. Then she meets a beautiful lesbian who turns her world up side down. She awakens from this sleep she has been in for so long. Her whole body is awakened, and on fire with feelings she never new she had. This movie is a MUST HAVE, and will remain a top favorite for all lesbians.
0375507256|5.0|Cloud Atlas was shortlisted for the 2004 Man Booker Prize, but lost to Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty, which was a travesty of literary justice.  Fearless, expansive, exuberant, masterful, Mitchell is the Joyce or Pynchon of his generation, and Cloud Atlas is his Ulysses or Gravity's Rainbow.  Compared to the ambition and achievement of Mitchell's novel, The Line of Beauty is a minor work.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is structured as six separate stories, beginning with the nineteenth century voyage of an American lawyer from Australia to Hawaii, and culminating in tribal battles on Hawaii's Big Island in a primitive post apocalyptic future.  In between we participate in the amorous escapades of a rogue musician in 1930s Belgium, the dangers faced by a young female reporter as she tracks down a nuclear scandal in 1970s San Francisco, the late life peccadilloes of a snarky London publisher in the here and now, and the adventures of a rebellious female clone in a futuristic Korean burger chain.  This sounds random, but the stories cohere through a few core themes: humanity's insistence on sorting itself into categories of superior and inferior; how our greatest achievements and deepest shames originate in the same wellspring of human wanting; that the political, economic and aesthetic systems we create end up ensnaring rather than freeing us.<br /><br />All the high concepts are grounded in stories that are sensuous, thrilling, funny and emotionally moving.  There are comic hijinks, tense chases and much evil, some of which triumphs over good.  It's hard to tell whether Mitchell is an optimist or a pessimist about the human condition, but he does encompass the full encyclopedia of human (and post-human) behaviors.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas restores one's faith in the power of literature to awe and inspire.  Among other things, Mitchell is a fierce autodidact, a world-class stylist, a spot-on mimic, a sly satirist, and a Perils of Pauline plotter with a highly evolved pulp fiction sensibility.  Enjoy his other novels too.  Ghost Writer, his first novel, is a warm up for Cloud Atlas.  Number9 Dream is a wild ride though modern Murakami Japan, Black Swan Green is the most hilarious and moving exploration of adolescence since Catcher in the Rye.  His latest, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet is a deep exploration of cultural collision between east and west.  You may come away convinced that Mitchell is the most talented novelist of his generation.ibility.  Enjoy his other novels too.  Ghost Writer, his first novel, is a warm up for Cloud Atlas.

B003BKZW40|3.0|\\"The Long Walk\\" is by far the best novella in this collection, and in my opinion is one of Mr. Kings best. \\"The Running Man\\" is entertaining and bears no resemblance to the Arnold Schwarzenegger film of the same name. \\"Road Work\\" doesn't feel like your typical Stephen King story and is probably not everyones cup of tea, but I found it a welcome departure from his normal stuff. The real reason I'm writing this review is to point out that this edition of The Bachman Books is missing one of the novels that was in the earlier editions. It was called \\"Rage\\" and it was about a psychotic teenager who takes his class hostage and kills his teacher. Stephen King had this book taken out of print after the Columbine shooting back in 1999. I'm disappointed that Mr. King made that decision, as I don't believe his book was at all responsible for that shooting or any other shooting. It is Mr. King's book though and it is certainly his decision whether or not it remains in print. If you are interested in reading the complete version of The Bachman Books I would recommend buying a used copy from another seller on Amazon. Who knows...maybe it will be worth money some day if Mr. King continues to keep \\"Rage\\" out of print.
0060936223|5.0|This book was the most amazing piece of literature I've read in a while.  Non-fiction but read like a fiction piece.  This could be, but is not an auto-biographical work.  Patti's music takes a backseat in this terrific tale of a relationship between two people destined for greatness if only through their sheer will power.  A few times during the book, the dreaminess and over abundant detail may become just a bit monotonous, but if this is a detraction, it is as minor as possible.  I would rate this book 4.5 out of 5.

B00005MP58|4.0|I've seen multiple versions of this classic from the Olivier Darcy to the MacFadyen Darcy. While Matthew MacFadyen is quite the hunky fellow, none can touch Firth for the combination of charm, elegance, animal magnetism and sheer acting genius. The dvd is a bit washed out in appearance and one must play a bit with the TV controls to get it just right but it is a small price to pay for this viewing experience. I am ever so glad the producers took the time to follow the book as closely as they did - to include two of Bingley's sisters, snapshots of Caroline Bingley's designs and hopes for Darcy's affections, Darcy's search for Wickham and Lydia in London, and so on. It lends completeness to the story that would otherwise have been lost. My sister and I both have copies of this particular version of the classic which will be permanent members of our viewing libraries. We even have backup copies in case the first ones wear out. To see this classic at its best, this would be the dvd to have.

B001GQACGE|5.0|This album is all about growth. For the people who say it's not like \\"Dangerously In love\\" and \\"B'Day\\" shut up! You would be compalining if she put out an album that sounded exactly like those. Half of the people who gave this album 1 star did not buy it, but they are jUST HATERS! This album is amazing. The first disc alone destroys, vocally and lyrically, anything that other singers have put out in the past 3 years. Her only competition is the mirror. Not to mention she destroyed the game WITH HER GRAMMY AND VMA PERFORMANCE. SHE DOESN'T NEED A BIG BUDGET ON STAGE, JUST A MIC AND A BEAT! THAT IS TALENT. KERI HILSON AND OTHER HATERS MUST FALL BACK, THE QUEEN IS HERE AND SHE'S COMING BACK... SOONER THAN YOU THINK. I wish the album would never stop. Her voice is amazing and no other singer can compare to her. 15 plus years in the game!!! LEGEND, ICON, SUPERSTAR!     Stand out tracks:    Whole first disc!    Second disc:  Single Ladies,  Radio,  Diva--- she needs to let the haters know why they are hating  Video Phone- so much fun
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I hadn't seen the initial release of this movie in theaters, but was somewhat interested. Recently rented it via N!@#$%x and was BLOWN away.     I don't want to alienate anyone, but if you are a gamer, you will LOVE this movie. BUT PLEASE, if you are not a gamer, you will enjoy the movie based on the acting, the incredible wit of the screenplay and the loveable characters. This movie has enough one liners to become an instant classic. GREAT CHARACTERS....ALL OF THEM. They're all so unique and interesting. No clones in this movie.     And outside of the action, the characters and the script, you have this amazing visual presentation that is just stunning; like nothing I've seen before.     I've already watched this movie four or five times since I laid eyes on it two weeks ago. And I just ordered the bluray for keeps.     I want a sequel, but don't think it will ever happen. This is an instant classic!
0812550706|5.0|This was a very good book and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in science fiction. Also if you like any other science fiction books or movies you would enjoy this book for sure!
0984334904|5.0|I bought these to help practice for my Japanese test and to help expand my vocabulary. I just opened them and I'm so pleased! The quality is really top notch. Since there are lots of pictures of the cards, I won't go into it, but the format is amazing. I find that the lack of romaji to be a positive thing. White Rabbit also included a small katakana/hiragana card in the set if you need to practice. I couldn't ask for more out of a flash card. I am so excited to start practicing with such an awesome product!
B000Z27HLS|4.0|Due to the business portion of making films, one assumes a book won't be followed word for word in transferring it to film. As long as the adjustments made don't detract from the substantance of the story, I can live with that. Such is the case with this interpretation of Northanger Abbey. The essential story is still there while some omissions did take place such as replacing the Japaned armoire with a common trunk when Katherine finds the laundry lists, a shortcutted way of introducing Eleanor's love interest, and so on. I am glad the digressions to Katherine's fantasy worlds were kept brief or it would have been quite distracting. Felicity Jones was great as Katherine but she has such a youthful appearance - played an 18yr old, looked 14 - that it made her look like a kid sitting at the adult's table. Everyone seemed visually more mature than her, it was a tad distracting. Poor girl will be checked for her ID until well into her 30's! I find no fault with her performance; to the contrary, I thought it superb. The show stopper was Carey Mulligan as the unscrupulous Isabella. My one big regret is that they did not bring the story to conclusion with the reconciliation between Tilney and his father, which was included in the book. That was an important piece that shouldn't have been omitted. It only got 4 stars from me because of that omission. In all, I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation, added it to my library and got a copy for my sister.
B003OJBWGK|2.0|I have to admit that I've listened only to the previews, so I can't really comment on the music, which seems pleasant but bland.  But what turns me totally against this CD is the recording.  The band and the music are lost in what sounds like a recording made on a cheap 1950's tape recorder.  You can barely tell what's going on in the music.  It's all fuzzy and tinny.  It sounds like they're playing under water.  Just awful.  I was attracted by an excellent review of one of their concerts but frankly I can't tell whether or not they have any talent.
0446364495|2.0|This book has sparked the imagination of millions of people who have sought the meaning of true love. And what a better setting than a marital affair to ignite the passion of love? Either the author will go down in literary history as the man who destroyed countless marriages or the man who helped countless people find their soulmate. Either way, he knew the rules of romantic novels: there must be some kind of forbidden love, a fantasy to escape from real life, and a longing that can never be had. The only thing that bothers me is the insecurity that many readers will feel about their own marriage. It is not a good feeling. It is a pervasive feeling full of mistrust and jealousy. Perhaps the author was projecting his own insecurity based on a real experience. He may want men and women to suffer as he did, out of pure sadism disguised as a simple love story written by an innocent naivete. In any case, the author has opened the pandora box and we are never the same again. I have to admit, the book is well written and it is often very touching. But I cannot help but wonder how timeless a story this can really be if Robert and Francesca met briefly BEFORE she was in a committed relationship. Circumstances drove them apart and then she married, only to search for Robert in her heart all her life.     Ah well, Mr. Waller was determined to create true love out of a marital affair. So now the search for true soulmates continue to increase as marriages become questionable once the passion of sex dies down. I wonder how Robert and Francesca would have lived their lives together once they marry and have children? Will their true love persists, or will she be thrown into the world of affairs once again? After all, they cannot possibly be devoted entirely to each other and each other alone when the pressure and stress of family and every day life surround their space.     In this way, the story is utterly unrealistic. It is in actuality a book about feelings. Positively speaking, we can search for these feelings within our own marriages with our own partners. It is a fantasy book for couples.
0786956291|4.0|As a nostalgic reminder of pen and paper gaming's bygone years, the red box can't be beat.  A lot of my thirty-something gamer friends all remember the iconic cover, and gravitated to the box as soon as they saw it.  As an intro to role playing and D&D 4th edition it does it's job pretty well, although I have a problem with the quality of some of the materials and the lack of some important info in the books like equipment.  Let me address my likes:    1) It's a boxed set! I loved the old school boxed set feel, with dice and tokens there is plenty of toy value in this set.    2) It is a complete boxed intro to gaming and adventure.  The choose your own adventure is very reminiscent of the old red box, which had a similar gimmick to teach the basic rules. No Bargle to be seen though :(      3) The box itself is five star quality compared to older boxed sets.      Now my dislikes:    1) As mentioned in other reviews, the card quality is complete crap.  I know that they had to keep costs down, but come on.  WotC is known for some the most popular card games in history.  There is no excuse for them to put it these hard to separate, flimsy, el-cheapo cards.    2) The booklet covers are literary just another page in the booklet, not a thicker, more durable material like card stock or something.  The paper isn't even bond weight, it's something thinner.    3) Not enough rules in the box to actually cover independent character generation.  The old red box allowed you to create basic level 1 characters.  With this you are forced to use the choose your own adventure to gen characters.      4) No equipment lists, not even an abbreviated one with the most common items.  You'll have to wing it if the PC's head to town to re-equip.      In short, buy this if you are feeling nostalgic, if your kid is old enough to learn how to play, or are completely green to RPG's.  Don't buy this if you are looking for something to build your own adventures with or run a basic level 1-2 game.  There isn't enough material in it to make it worthwhile.
B00466H3DG|5.0|I just wanted to add to what's been written here already. The blu-ray contains all the bonus features from the 2-Disc Collector's Edition, so if you're upgrading from the more common single disc DVD it's absolutely worth the money. Those extras include:    A Look Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  A Conversation with Jim Carrey and Director Michel Gondry  Feature Commentary with Michel Gondry and Writer Charlie Kaufman  Polyphonic Spree Music Video  Lacuna Commercial  Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry  Anatomy of a Scene: Saratoga Avenue  A Conversation with Kate Winslet and Director Michel Gondry  Deleted & Extended Scenes    The extras are what sold me on an upgrade. The movie itself? I realize it's a polarizing experience, but for me I see something new with every viewing. The blu-ray edition simply supplements the experience.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|Like many other mid-80s babies, I was too young to be able to appreciate Depeche Mode at the peak of their popularity during the Violator days. However, just like Michael Jackson's \\"Black or White\\" and many other songs by different artists, \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" and \\"Personal Jesus\\" constitute the musical background of my childhood and therefore are always with me on almost subconscious level. Depeche Mode that I \\"discovered\\" on my own when I was in my teens is the Depeche Mode of Ultra - brooding, dark, elegant, personal and vulnerable. Recently I embarked on another journey into the Mode's catalog and got a full appreciation of the brilliance of their earlier stuff, while still having a soft spot for their later work, such as Ultra, Exciter and Playing the Angel. And of course, I finally got to listen to Sounds of the Universe, which is why I'm here in the first place  I can see why so many people dislike this album - it certainly does not contain as many instantly recognizable, highly melodic and, for the lack of better word, \\"catchy\\" songs as most of Depeche Mode's albums do. In their previous works they managed to distill and compact the beauty of music and lyrics into 3-4 minute increments. Now, on Sounds of the Universe, the beauty is still there and there is plenty of it, but this time around it is manifested in a much more amorphous form with lots of intro-track space. The album title is actually perfect for the material because it does have a very \\"spacey\\" feel to it.  The only song that fits the traditional DM \\"formula\\" is probably \\"Wrong\\", which makes it a very misleading flagship single. With all that being said, \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" is still 100% recognizable Depeche Mode, it just requires a bit of a specific state of mind (meditative and inquisitive) and some patience to appreciate. Tracks like \\"In Chains\\", \\"Come Back\\", \\"Fragile Tension\\", \\"Perfect\\", \\"Peace\\" do deserve it.   Can I say it's my favorite DM work? Probably not. Is it their worst? I can'treally say so, I think it's just... different. Do I think they are \\"done\\" and need to retire? It's up to them, really, but I sure hope not, because to me the material does not seem \\"dated\\" or \\"tired\\", again, it's just different   P.S. Do yourself a favor and listen to the B-side track \\"Ghost\\".  Not including it on the actual album is an understandable decision, since it doesn't really fit with the rest of the songs. However, just like PTA's \\"Martyr\\", it is an excellent, very DM song that can stand on its own. Listen to it a few times, and Dave will truly become \\"a voice in your head\\"
B003UESJHE|5.0|THE KING'S SPEECH is many things.  It is the story of a man who never wanted to be king.  It is the story of a man who must overcome a debilitating condition.  It is also a story of an unbreakable friendship and belief in yourself.  THE KING'S SPEECH is my choice for Best Picture of the Year.<br /><br />Prince Albert was never supposed to become the king of England.  He was content being a naval officer and a husband.  But when his father, King George V, died and his flamboyant brother, King Edward, scandalously abdicated to marry American divorcee Wallace Simpson, \\"Bertie,\\" as he was known to his family, suddenly found himself thrust on the throne and into the lime light... just when England was on the brink of war and needed a strong king the most.  You see, Bertie had an almost incapacitating stutter; he could barely make himself understood, especially during public speeches.  But his loving wife, Queen Elizabeth (who became the Queen Mother), never gave up hope or her belief in her husband, and eventually introduced him to Lionel Logue, an out of work Australian actor who had some unconventional, yet successful, methods that helped many people overcome their stutters.  Along the way, a very extraordinary friendship is formed, hardships are overcome, and a true king is made.<br /><br />THE KING'S SPEECH is a remarkable film, full of warmth, sentiment, and heart.  Then entire cast is outstanding, most especially Colin Firth as King George VI, Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue, Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth, and Michael Gambon as King George V.  This entire ensemble deserves the highest accolades, including Timothy Spall in a cameo as Winston Churchill.  The chemistry is wonderful, the atmosphere is real and believable, the cinematography is era-perfect, and the story is heartbreaking and uplifting all at the same time.  You will laugh, cry, and care; and these are the things the best films should do.<br /><br />I really didn't know what to expect when I saw THE KING'S SPEECH, but I am so very glad my husband talked me into it.  It is simply wonderful, not to be missed.  And, I hope, the 2011 Oscar Winner!am so very glad my husband talked me into it.  It is simply wonderful, not to be missed.  And, I hope, the 2011 Oscar Winner!

B00008977N|5.0|Got this yesterday. It's the latest widescreen release. Watched it last night first in Dolby 5.1 and thought the sound balance was a bit off. Watched it the second time (yes it was that good) in DTS 5.1 and it made an amazing difference. Maybe it's just my system but I would advise anyone buying this to try it in the DTS setting available on the DVD.<br />Picture quality was good.<br />I had seen this years ago on HBO or Showtime and was hoping this was that concert.<br /><br />The only thing wrong with it is that it ended too soon. I guess that might be why I watched it twice in the same night
B004DK5CYM|2.0|I'm a big fan of Secretariat but this is a movie about Penny Tweedy and Secretariat, how their lives touched. I liked the storyline: that you can make your dream come true but the title isn't true. Secretariat's career wasn't followed to the end, the movie touches on the fact that he was smart and that he had a huge heart but the race footage wasn't real. They only used bits of the original footage for the Preakness. The Wood, the Derby and (worst of all) the Belmont were all fake, not him. For real information about Secretariat, the horse, I'd recomend Bill Nack's book. Let me also say I felt the same way about Seabiscuit.
0312370849|5.0|This is not the book you take on vacation. This is not the easy beach read. It is the two pots of coffee,boxes of tissue, leaves you totally wrung out read. You ask yourself the question; How did I never know this? And more importantly; Now that I do, how do I live with this knowledge.    Paris during the second World War, occupied by the German Army has been written about many times. Never have I heard about Vel'd'Hiv and all it's hell. Reading about children, babies abused, and virtually abandoned by the very people who should protect them makes you weep.    The story within the story about a writer and her discovery of this government cover up brings the reader to modern day. She and you feel compelled to dig deep to find all the facts and eventually discover ugly truths as well confront her own failings.     Highly recommend this book, but be cautioned. It will leave you sleepless and make you want to cancel your trip to France!
0385341679|5.0|This was one fantastically-wicked series!  It wasn't afraid to push the envelope, get down and dirty and at times be utterly depraved and deplorable.  Through this series, Mac has had a gradual metamorphosis.  Starting with the first book, Mac 1.0 was a pure, delicate flower.  However, somewhere along the way, Mac 2.0 adapted and reformed into a matured, butt-kicking woman; whose ferocity was completely unbounded.    This installment was a perfect ending to a creative and exciting series.  I am really going to miss it, but it does help knowing the author is working on another series to be set in the Fever World.  Hopefully we'll get more of Mac and Barrons, however, I'd also be interested to see what becomes of Dani's wild-card character.    For those SF fans who are looking for a bit of a hybrid between DUR and SF, IMO, this book and series could be described as such.  The author offers you descriptions of different types of planets and dimensions in exquisite detail.      [...]
0307592839|5.0|Beautifully written story of the intertwined lives of some not so perfect people. The introspective nature of the dialogue was done so well that I personally identified with some of the conflicts within certain characters. The only real disappoitment for me were the problems regarding the graphic components of the novel that were not rendered readable on the Kindle. Other readers have I identified this problem. Should Kindle resolve this, I would hope Amazon would send another copy to me.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|We grew up watching these sci-fi thrillers at the drive-in and loving them. Some you could (and still can) laugh at just because they were \\"B\\" movies in every sense of the word -hokey sets,phony monsters,terrible dialogue-great fun. But this one is a cut above the rest by quite a lot. The sets make \\"Star Trek\\" look bad-sorry trekies. Obviously a lot of thought, time, and money went into this one and it shows. You can actually watch it and take it seriously (with a grain of salt), or you can just watch it as a great example of it's genre. The great thing about this edition are the extras. We weren't even aware of the other Robbie movie, and the story of Robbie is very interesting and makes the movie even more enjoyable. Highly recommended!

0399536108|5.0|This is easily one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read several thousands, including dozens upon dozens in the area of self-help, personal development, and business. This book should be required reading from about 6th grade on.<br /><br />I had a Physical Education teacher in school who used to say, \\"There are two kinds of people in this world: eagles and sheep. You'd better be figuring out which one you are.\\"<br /><br />This book is for those who would be eagles rather than sheep.<br /><br />As someone who has followed an alternative path similar in some ways to the author, the ideas and experiences presented resonate extremely well with me. I instantly recognized a kindred spirit.<br /><br />The book is about breaking out of our sleepwalking trance, taking responsibility for our own lives, and creating the life we desire as much on our own terms as possible. The author talks about his own life and examples from the lives of others who have made their dreams come true - not by following the same old paths we are taught will do this for us (they won't), but by really deciding to understand what they really want out of life and to overcome the fear of going for the dream.<br /><br />Well, many books and other works these days address that topic, but this book is for those who dare to dream outside the realm of what mainstream thought deems \\"possible.\\" This is not about fast track MBA degrees to get that great corporate job, but about being creative about being self-employed and adjusting one's priorities and lifestyle to make that dream of independence come true.<br /><br />This book is for those who would take as much control over their own experience of life as possible, and live the most satisfying existence they can imagine (or even, better, in fact).<br /><br />It is not just about pumping people up with lots of cool sayings, proverbs, and once-in-a-lifetime stories, but contains hard-earned wisdom about deciding what matters and creating ways to makethat happen. It is also about fear and overcoming the programming which is in place to control people and prevent them from doing just what the author is talking about. The author shares what he has learned in his experiences, all the way from academia to volunteering in war-torn Africa and in-between. He discusses some very basic decisions we all have to make in life and his insights are well worth reading.<br /><br />This book is more about making changes in your thinking and actions than it is a specific plan for a specific kind of life. We can all be far more than we imagine, and the time to start on that journey of discovery is now.<br /><br />This book will help.<br /><br />If you are happy with the status quo and think life is just fine the way it is, then you will find nothing of value here. This is book for people who want to grow, explore, take charge, and make a life that matters.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B003L20IJM|5.0|This DVD was delivered so quickly that we thought it was a mistake.  Imagine our delight to receive it the day after we ordered it.  Impossible but true.     Wonderful film in perfect condition.  Thank you, press_play_connection - through Amazon.com.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|I own both the X31 and X41 headsets, and I was surprised at how much more comfortable the X31 set is compared to this more expensive set.  I purchased the X31 set first and loved them so much I convinced myself to \\"upgrade\\" to this new set for the full 7.1 surround and optical input etc. Unfortunately I must not be enough of an audiophile because I didn't notice a dramatic difference in sound quality with the few games I've played so far, and the noticeable discomfort of this X41 set pretty much negates any \\"bonus\\" I do get in the sound department.  The X31 headphones have a more oval shape to them, and as such they fit very naturally around my ears and feel amazing!  I can wear the X31 set endlessly and forget I even have them on most of the time.  Yet with this X41 series it seems they went with a strict circular design, which does cover my ears but seems to put pressure on points close to my ears that begins to really hurt after a few hours.  I've tried everything I can to adjust them and haven't had much luck.     Now maybe it's just my big head, or head shape, or quirky sensitivity around my ears - not sure. Your mileage may vary, but for me the cheaper X31s not only sound excellent, but are just perfect in the comfort department.     Comfort aside, these X41s sound excellent as well.  You won't be disappointed at all with the sound quality!
0743277708|4.0|When I had a trusted friend tell me that he had a riveting, suspenseful book for me to read I was excited. When he told me that the book was about bunnies, I thought of `Thumper' from Bambi, in some sort of Schwarzenegger movie with grenades and machine guns. However, the trust I have in my friend outweighed the ridiculous images I had in my mind of the Easter bunny as a pirate, or Bugs Bunny driving the van in a heist.    All that being said, `Watership Down' by Richard Adams is an extremely suspenseful book that makes your heart-rate skyrocket while you bite your nails, and pull your hair in anticipation of the unfolding, brilliant plot. The tale is about a group of rabbits, primarily Fiver, a peculiar runt that has prophetic abilities, and Hazel, a good hearted rabbit thrust into a position of leadership. The two decide to leave their warren with a few others due to the odd supernatural feelings Fiver receives concerning the future of their home.    Their departure results    in a compelling page turner that effortlessly engages the reader. At face value, the story really only has events that you would imagine occur in the dull life of rabbits: finding food, mates, and shelter. But Adams has a keen ability to create a sense of desperation within the reader for the rabbits to accomplish this task and does so this through his masterful character development. Each rabbit has their own distinct characteristics: some are eerie, some likable, some hysterical, and some downright frightening. The quirks, speech, and other unique qualities drove me to caring deeply for the outcome of Hazel, Fiver, and all of their peers.    There are also segments blended within the `Watership Down' of the rabbit's mythology and folklore that read as entertaining children's stories. These elements mixed with the `Lapine' glossary in the back of the book to help you decipher rabbit words for things like: tractors, badgers, and droppings, envelop the reader in a fantasy world that is actually a beautiful depiction of a real place seen through the eyes of wonderfully crafted rabbit characters.    Watership Down is a must read that I will proudly place on bookshelf number 4 of 5.    [...]
B00275EHJG|5.0|Being a fan of the Toy Story movies I figured I would like this movie as well.  I actually like it better than the first two, it has a really good story line and is clever.  I laughed quite a few times!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This way by far the best documentary I have seen regarding the 2008 collapse of the housing market and financial industry. I saw this movie 2 times in the theater and both times I left in rage over how corrupt our US government is and even more corrupt Wall Street. This movie is a must see for every person who was affected by the collapse, this was years in the making it could have been avoided but in the end the \\"old boy network\\" and select politicans knew exactly what they were doing and made trillions of dollars while the world sufferd and continues to suffer. See this film and recommend it to every person you know the word must get out on this film so we can punish the people responsible.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I loved the first season of The Big Bang Theory so much I ordered Seasons 2 and 3.  I'm waiting on Season 4 to be released. I've loved every nerdy episode! This group of four nerdy scientists and one ditzy blonde become a very dysfunctional family of friends. Characters are lovable in their own way.  Even Sheldon! See for yourself!
1932100660|1.0|The China study was an observational study. Correlations deduced from an observational study do not - in fact, cannot -- prove causation. As Dr. Eade points out, all you can really do with data from an observational study is to form a hypothesis, which must then be tested in randomized, controlled trials, to ferret out the truth about whether or not x actually causes y.    In many cases, the data (presented in arduous detail in the book Diet, Life-Style and Mortality in China) do not show statistically significant correlations between animal protein consumption and disease such as cancer at all. ****On the contrary. It would seem that sugar and carbohydrates are correlated with cancer - not animal protein**** In addition, the data indicate that fat is negatively correlated with cancer mortality, which again contradicts the claim that meat is harmful.
0670022411|5.0|Have you ever really (you know what I mean by really, not a peck) been kissed or touched by a person just in out of the freezing cold? It's not very pleasant. I never understood the romantic attraction to frigid vampires until now. Harkness, with her own authorial magic, made me believe that if I were a hot-blooded witch, the coolness of the undead's touch would feel welcome.  Here there is more than the standard vampire romance based on the primal attraction of predator/prey. Harkness's witch Diana is a worthy partner for powerful vampire Matthew Clairmont.<br /><br />I just adored this novel.  It has everything you want in a good read: terrific characters; a fast-moving plot filled with the world of academia, science, and the supernatural; and a singular world to explore. There are lots of details for the reader who wants even more, like hidden \\"Easter egg\\" references to other novels/characters; lots of descriptions of wine and tea and food that made me seriously hungry; and equally well-developed secondary characters.<br /><br />The only trouble is, when you reach the end you will throw the book across the room and yell because the sequel is not already in your hot little hands. So then you'll be forced to read it again.
1416594787|3.0|I suspect at least 95% of the people reading this book already are in the \\"evolutionist\\" camp. The other 5% are either on the fence, or looking for ammunition to refute evolution and support ID. (Or as I like to think, perhaps it should be called UID -- Un-Intelligent Design).    I basically fall into the evolutionist camp, but the more I read, the more questions I have. Not really unusual, I find it's common to have more questions the more you learn about something. The questions just get more specific.    In this case the main thing that stuck in my mind after reading the book is the CONSISTENCY of mammalian skeletons -- they're are ALL THE SAME in number and order of bones, while the size and function of each bone varies among different mammals. The same thing is true for crustaceans -- the relative location of various body parts are all the same, while the size & function changes significantly.    I fully \\"get\\" that this can be seen as proof of evolution. However, the thing that bothers me is that the evolution in these examples seem to \\"BEGIN\\" with a basic defined structure that DOES NOT VARY. It seems like there ought to be fossil remains that show the evolution (at least an occasional mammal fossil with fewer bones, for instance) to this basic structure that's in place today. I don't recall the book offering that. Of course maybe they exist, but palaeontologists might \\"fill in the blanks\\" as they EXPECT them to be, as opposed to what they really uncover.     I need to go back to another book I read \\"Shattering the Myths of Darwinism\\" by Richard Milton. I seem to recall he had something to say about this sort of thing.
B001NESPHC|5.0|First time listening to Melody.  Not quite as good as Dianna Krall and Norah Jones but she is a good addition to my collection of sexy singers.  Her voice is very clear and she is singing close to the microphone in this album.  Resembles more Norah Jones style. I highly recommend it and particularly like the first song \\"Baby I'm a Fool!\\". Most of the songs on the album were winners the first time I listened to it.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Yo Amazon, check your sources, these actors (Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde) are not in the original TRON film. Besides Amazons mistake in screen creds, this movie is awesome and I cant wait to get it on blu-ray.

B004M5HB74|5.0|The electronic synth duo of Elly Jackson and Ben Langmaid returns to the music scene with La Roux: Gold Edition. This collection of B-sides, live performances, and remixes is a standby for their new album, currently in production. Here's my track-by-track overview of the hold-over release:    In for the Kill (Remix feat. Kanye West) - An awesome collaboration between La Roux and Mr. West that takes hip-hop to a whole new level. Nice beats and addition of effects create this vintage sounding piece.    Finally My Saviour - A B-side consisting of electronic synth goodness. If you are familiar with the group, it sounds like a sonic fusion of In for the Kill and Growing Pains. A seamless addition to their debut album.    Under My Thumb - Rolling Stones cover. Elly places an electronic vibe over her voice as she sings through the track effortlessly and beautifully. This was originally found on the Sidetracked UK-exclusive compilation, but as a DJ edit that was used to fade the tracks together as one mix. Good to have this track in it's original format!    I'm Not Your Toy (Jack Beats Remix) - A repetitive remix of I'm not Your Toy. The electronic beats get tiresome after awhile, but this release needed a good remix and Jack Beats was the best offering out of the three on the UK exclusive 3-track I'm Not Your Toy EP.    In for the Kill (Skream's Let's Get Ravey Remix) - Already owned from the In for the Kill Remixes EP. It sounds like a singular toned backtrack, but fits perfectly with the vocals in such a way that it cannot be explained. The last minute is filled with beats. I replaced it with Finally (feat. La Roux) off of Skream's [[ASIN:B003U4T40U Outside the Box]] album. Very tribal-sounding with the drums, but very tranquill and a lovely remix of Finally My Saviour.    Quicksand (Boy 8-Bit Remix) - A reggae remix of Quicksand with pounding bass best heard through high-performance headphones or speakers.    Bulletproof (Zinc Remix) - Very repetitive dubstep remix. Previously released on the Bulletproof Remix EP. I replaced it with Bulletproof (Live at Shepherds Bush) found on The Gold EP.    Tigerlily (Demo Version) - The original, much more raw version of Tigerlily. Very nice addition to this release.    Bulletproof (Intimate Session at Abbey Road) - An acoustic version of Bulletproof with piano in the background and live vocals. I love this track and the raw talent that is put forth in Elly's vocals.    In for the Kill (Vevo Lounge Version) - Not my favorite performance. Elly's voice grates on my nerves here, but it's still nice to hear another acoustic session.    I also suggest adding this to the original album in your digital library for the true Gold Edition experience. This is La Roux and they are here to stay in my music library for years to come.
B00142X56Y|5.0|This I would say is the best version of \\"The Magic Flute\\" available on Blu-ray. Sound and video quality are excellent considering this event wasn't recorded on HD. Artistically speaking the performance is amazing, flawless. Diana Damrau is the best Queen of the Night ever, she delivers a powerful in your face performance, no wonder she's the cover of this blu-ray. She sings a perfect F6, like I never heard before. The disc comes with some extras but don't get too excited, they just consist in a short behind the scenes clip and a short interview with conductor Colin Davis. Also you'll find an illustrated synopsis of this beautiful opera. I got my copy a few days ago and I'm totally hooked. If you love \\"The Magic Flute\\" the way I do... this is a big MUST HAVE!!!
B002T9H2MO|5.0|Sam Rockwell was the crazy guy in Green Mile and others and he is very talented. His role in Iron Man 2 is key to it's overall success. This movie shows even more of his abilities and is very interesting and rewarding to watch. I'm becoming a real fan of this actor.
B003YNFAWI|5.0|[[ASIN:B003YNFAWI My Name Is Khan [Blu-Ray] Region Free (Bollywood Hindi Film DVD)]]  One of the best movies I have ever seen. It was my first Blu-ray movie and in addition to an excellent video quality, I was impressed by the enhanced audio. Wow!  Each note from each instrument could be heard with utmost clarity.  At one point I was so moved by the action that tears literally poured down my face  until the very end of the movie.Of course,it helped a great deal that I used   the English sub-titles. So far I have watched this movie twice. I definitely will  watch it again.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Buying products through Amazon is a very positive experience. I received the Robin Hood movie with Russell Crowe in very short order, not even a week after ordering. Great experience and a great movie.
0545123275|5.0|It's been a long time since an author has offered teens something with recognizable substance.  \\"Shiver\\" will settle in your bones and leave with that deliciously heavy feeling in your heart and in your gut that a tightly woven, sad story  gives you.  I love the style of this book and the unconventional way that the chapters are titled.  My only criticism on the negative side would be that the passage of time is a bit unclear.  BUT, the author makes up for that by weaving the beginning of Sam and Grace's relationship flawlessly.
B000Q67876|5.0|If you're reading this review, you probably already love the movie and are considering whether to purchase this specific Blu Ray. To that end, I wholeheartedly recommend that you purchase it.    The special features are numerous and very well done. Don't you hate it when you buy a DVD or Blu Ray, and there are sparse features - or none at all?    For me, a specific problem purchasing movies relates to the subtitle options. Spanish and French seem to always be the only options. Even on some Chinese and Japanese movies, there are no options for Chinese or Japanese subtitles! Fortunately, this Blu Ray has Mandarin Chinese (what I was looking for) in addition to Japanese, Portuguese, and yes...Spanish and French.    With these language options, the vast majority of the planet can now enjoy this fantastic movie.
0312600844|5.0|The book was wonderful! It's the 1st book I've \\"fallen into\\" in a VERY long time and it was such a pleasure for 4 days to be lost with these wonderful human charecters. Bravo! Just wonderful!
0756405890|3.0|Feels black and white where in all honesty, I'd rather read my fantasy in technicolor. One of my least favorite aspects of the book is the dialogue. There wasn't a moment in the novel where it felt authentic to the period or the genre. Instead, much of it felt like the way kids talk today.<br /><br />The story is familiar, the tropes are unoriginal, the plot points rote.<br /><br />Is it a nice story? Sure. You root for Qvothe. You want him to succeed in the face of adversity. But it's hard to really fall for this character or his friends, thinly drawn as they are, when the most traumatic events happen in the first few pages, and the remaining hundreds of pages are merely fall-out. Where's the magic in that? The relationship between Denna and Qvothe grew ever so tedious. If you quoted me dialogue from the book, dialogue that belonged to either Sim or Wilem, would I be able to tell them apart? Absolutely not.<br /><br />The regales of Qvothe's time at university are all too Potter-like, with bat-crazy teachers and secret hallways and mysterious locals.<br /><br />None of this adds up to anything more than a nice story, a way to escape for a while, and I'm quite surprised at the wealth of positive reader reviews found on the internet. If this is what passes for the best of the best, then I'm quite worried for the fantasy genre. Martin's next installment of Ice and Fire couldn't come soon enough (that, even when taking in to consideration his exceedingly mediocre most recent installment).<br /><br />Still, I'll pick up the next book to see where it goes. Any dip in quality from what is merely a passable threshold, and I doubt I'll continue reading.
B002ZG997C|1.0|Quasi-reliqious drivel; derivative post-apocalyptic nonsense, punctuated by entirely unbelievable \\"action\\", no plot, little characterization, and the usual scenery munching performance from Gary Oldman. There's nothing here that hasn't been done before - and should not be done again. The plot is almost non-existent, but there is one twist at the end (and it's pretty good, though entirely unbelievable, so I won't spoil it). As to the \\"mysterious\\" book Eli carries, its identity is obvious from the start, along with the right-wing religious bias of the movie, and, presumably, its makers. The ADD generation'll go for it, though - a lot of things blow up, crash, or get shot to pieces - nothing original. All who oppose the righteousness of the central character are evil, and must die.  Subtleties are absent.  There are vague parallels with the character of Eli in the Bible (the twist is one), but that's about it.  Right-wing God botherers, rent this, you'll love it.  Everyone else, avoid it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|An exciting finish, exhilarating as always. Katniss wrestles with her own nature, love, and the realities of mankind's tendencies. Interesting to see how Collins moved the plot to it's conclusion...with the bizarre twists and thrilling mechanisms in place...while simultaneously effectively communicating a stirring commentary on war and what we sacrifice for power. Will be interesting to see if a movie franchise can be as thrilling as what reader's create in their own minds while reading this. Great read, love the series.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|Why did the critics go orgazmic over this stinker?  Because at one point Natalie Portman's dance instructor grabs her by the crotch and in another scene she has a dream/hallucination about getting...getting..y'know that scene in her bedroom with Mila Kunis?  They're uh...<br />..well, let's just sweep that one under the rug. Okay..bad pun. A totally derivative psychological thriller (I found it psychologically boring).  The only thing good about this movie? Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis. they're quite dreamy in the dance scenes...  The only movie worse than this is The Crying Game.  At least in Black Swan I didn't have to be forced to see some hairy-knuckled guy in a dress show his ...show his...eh...okay I'll stop right there.
B004A79JME|4.0|This is a very enjoyable movie. I loved the lighting and photography in it. The music is also great. In spite of the fact that both actresses are naked most of the time throughout the movie, both actresses deliver their lines beautifully and naturally, and as the story develops you get emotionally involved with the characters. They really seem at ease with themselves and with each other and just flow. They share a moment in life, passion, fantasies, stories, emotions; a room. And the witness for this unusual love story is precisely a room in Rome.

This BN Publishing version of The Little Prince is HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT BUY IT FOR ANYONE, especially if they have never heard the real story before! I own several copies of this book and this is the most AWFUL translation from the original French that I've ever read. The pictures are black and white and awful quality and it completely misses the point and beauty of the original story in EVERY WAY!! It's DREADFUL!!!!
0451191153|4.0|Had to read this book in high school and enjoyed it then.  Read it again just a few months ago for pleasure and had a much greater appreciation for it.  I would recommend this book.
B003WTE886|5.0|As those of you who've read my other country album reviews will know, I generally stear clear of the genre due to the fact that for the most part it's rather depressing in terms of the subject matter and, with few exceptions, a lot of the singers actually sound the same to me. I don't just mean the style of music but the actual voices. Oh I can tell, say TOby Keith from Gary Allan and somesuch and Trace Adkins from the prior two (with that deep voice who couldn't?). But for the most part I'm not able to tell one country singer from another unless I've heard a particular song before.    Taylor swift is another matter. Though at first I was indifferent to her at best when TIm McGraw was new on the radio but that and the rest of the songs on her debut album grew on me. Then came Fearless a few years later and I liked what I heard. Then this last year my wife bought me Taylor's latest album as awedding present. And yet again I like it. One thing I like about Taylor is that while she does do her fair share of tearjerker type balads she does enough of the upbeat stuff to keep you from getting too depressed. I like her more than Carrie Underwood, though I'll acknowledge that Carrie does have a pretty voice. But my wife and my musical tastes rarely coincide since she's very much into hip hop, stuff that uses a lot of synthesizers and vocoders and stuff like that. We share an interest in some rock music but that's about it. So I was glad when we both took a liking to this album. It's refreshing to hear a new musician of any genre who doesn't feel they have to resort to AutoTunes and lots of vocoders to sound good, though I have heard some people claim that Taylor does use those. Usually you can tell though and the telltales aren't present in Taylor's music. But I like the more rock sound in some of the songs on this album, Better than Revenge comes to mind fairly quickly. So if you haven't given this album a listen yet you might just do yourself a favor by giving it a listen.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I believe this will become one of the most beloved of films. George VI was forced into a role he was ill-equiped to fill. Yet \\"Bertie did his best, Bertie always did his best!\\" as his wife declared. A humble man made insecure by his imperious father - King George V: \\"I was afraid of my father and my children will be afraid of me\\" - Bertie was able to take consolation in being a simple naval officer far from the public eye until Edward's abdication.<br />The plot is simple enough; Bertie (Colin Firth) stutters when speaking before an audience, his wife, Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter)seeks the help of a self-taught speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) to remedy his impediment.<br /><br />Yet the courage, vulnerability and humanity of the King and dry Australian humour of Logue in working on Bertie's impediment give the film its charm. George VI's basic decency and approachability endears himself to his people. The cheers and applause of the BBC technicians after the King addresses his Empire in a speech Logue guides him through like an orchestra conductor on the outbreak of WWII would never been extended to the distant George V. The Coronation newsreel was a sweet touch with its follow-on of Hitler's calculated histrionic harangue of his audience.<br />Princess Elizabeth asking, \\"What's he saying, Daddy?\\" and Bertie replying, \\"I don't know, but he seems to be saying rather well.\\"<br /><br />The part that I found most amusing was when Logue's wife returned to the house unexpectly during one the King's therapeutic visits. Logue behaves like a guilty schoolboy caught with his hand in the biscuit jar...to say more would be a spoiler!<br /><br />The film is a great investment for those times when you need a hero to brighten your day. \\"King's\\" is a theraputic addition to anyone's collection.
0451457994|5.0|I read this book decades ago, and of course I've seen the movie numerous times.  But the story remains one of the most compelling and interesting that I have ever read.<br /><br />What's compelling, I think, is its inscrutability.  The featureless, impenetrable black monolith, left on the Moon and on Saturn's moon, Iapetus (\\"Japetus\\" in the book) represent an otherness that confronts us with our own limits.  Although in the book much more is explained about the monolith and its makers than in the movie, it remains mysterious and beyond reach.  Amidst popular images of aliens as just like us, only different, Clarke's unseen aliens are utterly beyond and utterly different.  Their image stimulates humility.<br /><br />2001, the book, does differ in some details from 2001, the movie.  For one, the journey of the Discovery is to the Saturn system, not the Jupiter system. More significantly, Clarke explains what Dave Bowman experiences and learns rather than, as in the movie, allowing images to tease us with hints but no definitive account.  I have to say that I prefer the movie on that score.  Many people complained, and still do, that they can't figure out what is going on in the movie's final sequences.  But that seemed to me to be the point -- we just don't understand.<br /><br />Another point that is explained in the book more definitively than in the movie is Hal's breakdown.  Here it is plain that Hal is unable to cope with keeping his knowledge of the Discovery's true mission from Bowman and Poole, having to lie to them, at the same time as his own mission is to serve them.  Hal begins acting unpredictably, and he begins covering his tracks to keep his secrets and protect himself, for the sake of his own dedication to the mission.<br /><br />All in all, more is explained, and less is left mysterious, and I do prefer the movie although I love the book -- maybe the only time I have ever preferred a movie to a book.  In this case, though, it's not entirely true to say that the movie is based on the book.  Both were written at the same time, and it's not clear that Clarke ever would have written the book if not for the movie project.  For us as readers, it's hard not to read the book with the images of the movie in mind.

Both were written at the same time, and it's not clear that Clarke ever would have written the book if not for the movie project.  For us as readers, it's hard not to read the book with the images of the movie in mind.

0596101996|5.0|The great thing about it being a 5th edition, most of the issues, errors, oversights, and omitted content found in 1st editions are not a problem.  This book is thorough, well written, and filled with examples.  I also greatly appreciate how it ramps up the reader without overwhelming them.  Too many of these types of books go from a useless overview of the language to moderate or advanced concepts with little explanation as to how you got there.  I don't see this in this book.  Personally, I purchased this just as a reference book, and it's great for that.  You can look up almost anything in a few seconds, making it the kind of book you keep on your shelf for a long time.  I highly recommend this book as a way to become familiar with the power of Javascript, and in learning it, you'll also gain a little insight into all of the C based languages for web programming as well.  I'm bummed I ordered version 5 when version 6 is coming out in a month... but it's still a great book.
0394401522|5.0|The second volume of Mastering the Art of French Cooking is not an \\"add-on\\" to the set, it is the essential 2nd piece to what Julia Child and Simone Beck saw as their effort to make French cooking accessible to non-professinal cooks. The book carries on where Vol 1 left off - going into soups, breads, meat and vegetables that were not touched on in Volume 1 - and even extending the desserts that the first volume introduced. Child and Beck had envisioned an encyclopedia of French cooking, this is as close as they were allowed to come. Well worth the price, and a very worthwhile addition to the would-be French chef's home repertoire. Bon Appetit!

0307272702|4.0|This book contained quite a few eye-openers and some very sound analysis and descriptions. Some of the supporting anecdotes got a bit repetitious, but its a point worth repeating - the professionals to whom we trust our health have no clue as to why anybody is fat or lean, and routinely confuse symptoms with causes. After reading this book, you will notice the amazing buy-in our culture has with the idea eating makes you fat and exercise makes you thin. No other part of the way your body works is that simple, why whould the science behind fat retention be any different?    This books calls on the sciences of endocrinology, evolution, and the basic workings of your body to prove that it is not how much you eat or how much you exercise that determines how fat you are, but WHAT you eat.     My only criticism is that he fails to emphasize the importance of balance. The theme I noticed in this book that agrees with most other books that are on target is that balance is important - many things in life are not actually bad for you, until you get them out of balance, carbohydrates, alcohol and dietary fat being prime examples.    If you want to know why you are overweight, and a point in the right direction for what to do about it, this is the book for you.

In other words, anyone who likes action movies will LOVE RED!    The comedy intertwined with the drama makes this a fun watch.

032147404X|2.0|Reason I bought the book: I was just getting into photography and wanted to learn about my camera (D90) and how to use it. This book was rated very highly so I figured it was a no-brainer. Here's my concise review. If I'm lacking detail/explanation, comment on this post and I'll explain further.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Concise. Each \\"topic\\" is explained in about 3/4 of a page. Sometimes less, sometimes more.<br />- Touches on all of the basics, with little if any technical explanation. A good starting point for digital photography if you don't care about learning \\"why\\" things work the way they do.<br />- Easy, quick read.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Touches on all of the basics, with little if any technical explanation. Maybe this is what you're looking for, but it only made me want to put the book down and Google things (aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.) or buy another book to find out more (which I did).<br />- Expensive. This is only the first of three \\"volumes\\". He basically wrote a mediocre-at-best book, chopped it into three cuts, and then added intro and conclusion paragraphs to each. This should have been sold as a single, $25 volume instead. (Disclaimer: I have NOT read the additional two volumes, but I've looked at their tables of contents. Do this yourself and you'll see what I mean.) (Disclaimer 2: I am aware that you can get all three in a single package on Amazon, but you can certainly get better reading material for the $70 retail [$44.09 Amazon] price tag.)<br />- Biased/unclear advertisements within the book's body. At one point he advertises the site \\"WhereTheProsShoot.com\\", ranting and raving about it. Go there right now. What's it say? Under construction? Hmm...seems like a biased review of a not-yet-existent product from one of his buddies. As for being unclear... he never mentions that he gets paid for his recommendations, but flip to the back of the book and you'll see that many of the sites/stores he recommends are sponsors of this very book. This is illegal in television, and generally frowned upon elsewhere.<br />- Sense of humor that is so bad it detracts from the material.<br /><br />What I recommend instead (as a D90 owner):<br />\\"Mastering the Nikon D90\\" by Darrell Young<br />\\"Complete Digital Photography\\" by Ben Longally frowned upon elsewhere.  - Sense of humor that is so bad it detracts from the material.    What I recommend instead (as a D90 owner):  \\"Mastering the Nikon D90\\" by Darrell Young  \\"Complete Digital Photography\\" by Ben Long
B001SS3JS8|4.0|I always enjoy reading Jodi Picoult's books, especially this one. It seems as if each one of her books somehow hits close to home. I could hardly put this book down and I would (and do) recommend this book to avid readers.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|I got this book because I was interested in its plot, which is similar to Lockdown, another favorite series of mine.  A compelling cast, dark secrets, and even a WHOLE OTHER PLOT with a disease known as the Flare.  I lost so much sleep reading this.  Read it now!
1594202842|5.0|Some people criticized this book harshly without even reading it. The controversial newspaper article is NOT the whole story. Putting up extreme opinions on the internet before reading the book does not do anything but underscore your own ignorance. Amy Chua does not intend for the book to become a parenting guide but it is merely a memoir of her experiences and it should be taken as such.     Some misunderstandings that have aggravated me:   1. This is not a Chinese VS White parentings. The \\"Chinese Mom\\" can be a White dad, Korean, Jamaican, Indian or Irish parents. In other words, any parent that has the same parenting style as Chua. The western style is also very loosely labeled. Chua understood that there are multitude of parenting styles in America and just pick on the stereotypical generalization. These are all mentioned in the first couple of pages of the book.     2. Chua did not call her daughter \\"garbage\\" in public. She merely related that story during a dinner conversation.     3. This is supposed to be read as a self-deprecating memoir spiced with humor and honesty. In other words, don't take it so seriously and enjoy it!     On a different note: I don't agree with some of Chua's methods but really as someone who is raised by a \\"Chinese Mom\\", I have a very different perspective than the critics. I find the list of rules to be hilarious, mostly because I was raised with similarly strict rules. Her humorous description of hypothetical reactions of the \\"Chinese Mothers\\" to a B grade described my mom perfectly. Plus, my mom called me \\"stupid, lazy, failure, slow and multitude other insults\\". But the thing about those insults is that they are not supposed to be taken literally, they are just supposed to make you feel bad for misbehaving and behave better. In fact, my brothers and I joke a lot about our mom's rules and explosive temper now. I grew up to have a pretty healthy self-esteem and I doubt Amy Chua's daughters will be any different.     So really justbe a bit more open-minded and have fun reading the book.
B00003CX9E|3.0|I watched Citizen Kane for the first yesterday, and I liked the film and thought it was good, but I would not call it the best movie ever.  The good: Orson Welles is solid in his portrayal of Kane, the story has a great moral to it, and it has aged well overall.    The bad: It drags in some places and the can be boring at times.    Overall Kane is an great movie, but it is not the best.  Many people have already given good reasons why this was so I will just quickly say that innovations and firsts do not make a movie the best.
0061537969|4.0|I really enjoyed this read, something about it makes it very captivating. It was quick one too. Personally the whole car racing thing didn't do it at all for me, so I skipped some of the more elaborate explanations, but overall the story is nice and if you like dogs you'll love this. It also has elements of family, relationships and a bit of fantasy (the dog making conversations etc).    Give it a try, most people obviously like it.
1608201236|5.0|This is the final installment of the series with Adrien and Jake and is a joy to read. One of the best things about this story is that I did not feel sad after reading it; I will definitely miss A&J but Josh has written such a wonderful mystery and final story arc for A&J that everything came together perfectly.  As usual, the secondary characters are all exceptional.    Josh also has a way of bringing history to life, whether it is the 50 year old mystery of the body found, or the hundreds years old mystery of an artifact that ties into the skeleton. Highly recommended!

030746363X|5.0|I'm appalled that so many people have seen fit to write these LONG reviews, screaming \\"Tim Ferriss isn't so smart! He didn't say anything new! He didn't include absolutely everything about diet/exercise/sex! It didn't work for me because 1) I'm superhuman already or 2) I know too much about everything else!\\" He says right away that he/his experiments are not perfect and that we SHOULD be skeptical AND let him know when he's wrong. He gives his readers credit for being intelligent adults with the power of discernment and the ability to question, think and learn for themselves.     Most adults understand that everything is not going to work for everybody; however, I am happily finding that these minimal methods are working for me! As for others, you should simply try what appeals to you. Keep what works and toss what doesn't. Don't misplace the blame if you experience any lack of success. Check out the book from the library if you're averse to spending money on it (but be prepared to wait a few weeks to get it!). Have fun discovering what works for you. Tim Ferriss did, and it makes for an enlightening and entertaining read, even if you don't follow his protocols!

B0042RUMEQ|5.0|This album may not be as \\"hardcore\\" as her mixtapes but I still found it to be a very enjoyable album. It can be very \\"pop\\"-y at times (Check it Out, Right Thru Me, Your Love, Last Chance) however she does throw down quite a few rap verses as well (Roman's Revenge, Muny, Did It On 'Em). The guest stars are just that, guests; they add to the tracks they are on, but Nicki stays the main attraction throughout. My favorite tracks are Super Bass, Roman's Revenge, Moment 4 Life, and I'm the Best.
B0043GXYBO|1.0|While I don't want to compare this book to Twilight, it has some glaringly obvious similarities.    1) the main characters are both a complete Mary Sue and utterly wrapped up in their own world without two seconds thought given to how other people might react to their actions. There is the main character and then there are a bunch of needlessly named blobs of un-described flesh running around in THEIR territory. They are dumb, ditzy, plain jane characters who lack the backbone to stick up for themselves and always opt out for the easier option (ie Damsel in Distress Syndrome, or Let's Just Run Away and Ignore Our Problems Because That's How Things in Life are Solved). They whine and whine and whine when they have not a thing to honestly whine about. Yeah teenagers are annoying and can occasionally be silly and like to toot their own horns, but any sane teenager wouldn't act like Beryl or Chloe. These characters are so unmemorable and boring I can't be bothered remember their names.    2) neither author can write worth a damn. Seriously, if you are going to write in first person at least do it in an interesting way rather than going down the line of checklists for what each character is doing at every moment. We don't need to know what the hell a 16 year old is eating for dinner because it is NOT RELEVANT TO THE STORY. If you can't convey the feelings each character is having in an eloquent, thought provoking way... then don't write, because you are ruining literature for people who don't do it just to make millions off the vulnerable market.    3) both books were written based on a wet dream. Please. Please. If a guy saves his own moneyshot, it's creepy. If a woman gets excited over a dream and decides to write a book about it, it's JUST as creepy.    4) There really isn't a plot. The other books are just as bad with their no-plot, and what plot there is is completely ruined by the selfish, whiny, spoiled teenger we're meant to be experiencing this through.    I only read this book because a friend lent it to me. But it is a horrible book. I'm a quick reader, but this took me almost 2 months to work through because I'd force myself to read a chapter, and then put the thing down for a week just to recuperate and wash my brain out. I literally wanted to gauge my own eyeballs out every time the character used a word like 'boobie' or 'poopie' and then 'hee hee' in her head. Honestly? Whichever gal wrote this needs to go back to 6th grade English class and start over.    To restore my faith in humanity I picked up The Fountainhead 33 pages into reading this. It made me feel much better, though I'm shocked and confused as to how this book ever made it past the pile of rejection papers on various editor's desks. But then I noticed the publishing house, Atom. Just like Twilight, some small publishing house with no reputation decided to publish some $#!&&Y vampire novel to sell to younger girls to boost their own company. Congratulations, you have completely missed the point of individuality and independence and are providing utter trash for girls to read. It's sickening, really.    Moral of the story, I'm too old for this. When I was 14 I was reading Ayn Rand, Ray Bradbury, Philip Pullman and various books of that nature. Nothing especially difficult, and I'm not an overly intelligent person, but I certainly knew the difference between trash and not trash at that age. You would think these editors, who make novels their LIFE, would take literature a little more seriously and choose to publish books with an actual message other than 'pretend to be a vampire, get vitamin D deficiency, date the hottest guy in school even if he's a drunk, win at life.'    If I could give this a 0, I would. The only thing that even redeems vampires at this point is Sunshine by Robin McKinley because everyone else seems to think that they are nice, good looking undead walking around who definitely don't want to step on any human toes. Ooohh... Now, Sunshine... THAT is a well-written 1st person vampire book worth reading and I highly recommend it to all.

B003NHRIVQ|4.0|The Last Song is a story about a troubled teenage girl who is sent to spend the summer with her estranged father. The story centers around forgiveness, first love, and death. The emotions of this story have viewers reflecting on their lives and looking to see if they should take the time the to reach out to someone they have lost touch with that they love.  The location of filming on Tybee Island Georgia is beautiful, you forget you are sitting in your home watching a movie and you are tranformed to the beach front.  The soundtrack is well written and appropriate.  The movie stars Miley Cyrus as Ronnie, Liam Hemsworth as Will, Bobby Coleman as Jonah, and Greg Kinnear as Steve.  Greg Kinnear gives a wonderful emotional performance as Steve the father, you feel the pain on his face and in his words.  Bobby Coleman gives a heartfelt performance beyond his years, when he cries their is not a dry eye.  Liam Hemsworth is very down to earth and relaxed in his role as Will.  Miley Cyrus lacks the drama to pull off such an important role as Ronnie.  Her performance leaves the viewer demanding something more from her character. In the story Ronnie must forgive her father for the divorce from her mother and leaving New York to move to Georgia.  Ronnie has shut out everyone in her life except her brother.  She finds a boy and falls in love forgives her father.  Her life is turning around until she learns her father is dying. Miley Cyrus needs a few more years of acting school before she can make a drama of this magnitude believable. Over all this movie is a wonderful family movie, it is rated PG for some violence, sensuality, and mild language. The lessons taught from this movie can help heal families that are estranged and bring them together.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is a cracker of a movie.  Just the thing after watching very serious movies taking on very worthy and serious subjects.  This was fun, lots and lots of fun.  All I can say is that if you want to take a couple of hours off and enjoy yourself this film is for you.  Every actor carries his or her weight and the storyline is fantastic.  I was looking forward to the DVD as I did not catch it at the movies.  It did not disappoint.  Hope they make another this was a blast.

B003YBNREI|5.0|I saw the Dobbie Brothers in concert this past summer (2010) appearing with Chicago. They previewed 3 songs from this album.  By the way, the concert was fabulous, especially the encore when they and Chicago performed a medley of both groups greatest hits!!

0670022411|5.0|This is not your ordinary story about witches, vampires and daemons!<br /><br />Diana Bishop's famous ancestor was executed for being a witch. As a heart-rending consequence of Diana's parents' mysterious deaths, Diana has vowed she will live totally as a human, denying her identity as a witch with both usual and unusual powers. Dedicating her life to logic and ordinary living, she is now a history scholar doing research on alchemy texts in the Bodleian library at Oxford. Upon receiving a requested text called Ashmole 782, she realizes either the book is spellbound or there is something about this book that connects with her hidden witch powers. Add to that the reactions of suddenly appearing witches, vampires, and daemons whose animosity and threatening looks and words make Diana's wish for normalcy an illusion she can no longer ignore.<br /><br />Into the midst of this reality arrives a handsome, extremely intelligent and old vampire, Matthew Clairmont, who is supposedly pursuing his own research as a geneticist. Initially disliking and avoiding his presence, Diana finally begins to realize he is protecting her from direct attack by the hordes of persons appearing daily in the library who are insisting she recall the text they are desperate to obtain. Then he begins to appear during her running and rowing exercises which seem to be the only way she can stop her natural abilities from emerging with perilous effects on herself as well as others.<br /><br />Why is Matthew so attracted to Diana and what is behind the interest so many have in this mysterious text lost for centuries which has appeared and again disappeared after Diana's innocent unbinding of its pages? Finally, when several close calls with death frighten Diana into realizing her lack of control, she accepts shelter first with Matthew's vampire family in France and then with her own witch family in America.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches is so much more than just a supernatural story! Yes there are adventurous thrills for those who love the proverbial accounts of such creatures. But here is an intelligent consideration of the essence of origins, differences, genetic mating and consequences, shared powers defying definition and classification, versions of history holding secret and amazing phenomena, relationships of enmity forced to unite under common needs - both good and evil, the quintessential realities behind the search for the Philosopher's stone or alchemy, and so much more.<br /><br />Add to that a sweet, dangerous romance all the more real because of what seems to be its doomed end, and herein is the perfect combination, preciously difficult to adequately encompass in any brief review. This tale is a smart, tense, provocative, and enchanting read you will not want to end and will be relishing long after the last page is turned.

B003FNWR6Y|5.0|My son received this game for his 8th birthday. It was the perfect gift as he is both a huge Mario fan and also has just taken to the original game of monopoly. The great thing about Monopoly is the maths practice that the children get while playing and also learning how to play strategically. It's a bit of a shame that they didn't make the playing tokens actual Nintendo characters such as Yoshi, Mario, Peach etc but that is a minor detail. There is only just enough $1 to $20 notes for a game with 4 people. We just grab some extra money from our original Monopoly game if needed. Also a few extra houses (power ups) would also be good. Overall, we love this game and would definitely recommend it.
B004HD2ZIQ|5.0|The World Is Yours is another outstanding effort from Motorhead and one of their best album in the last decade plus IMO. Lemmy, Phil and Mikki once again sticks to their guns and delivers another onslaught of their trademark tough, no hold barred rock and roll. I highly recommend The World Is Yours, whether you`re a hardcore Motorhead fan like myself or just getting into the band. I also recommend that The World Is Yours should be played as loud as hell, which is the best way to listen to it.
1591843162|3.0|No, Linchpin is far from indispensable. There's some good ideas in here,and I give Seth Godin credit for trying to inspire the masses with his free-wheeling style.  The problem I had with it is it seems to lack enough meaty substance to carry a whole book (vs a long article), and the organization is weak. How many times does he have to repeat the same message? Not sure where some of the chapters are going, and again, there's those repeated messages. Yes, we know we're stars, we know we're artists, and it's up to us to live up to full potential,and so on, but tell me once or twice and I get it. Compare this to one of the great books, like The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, where each chapter stand alone with a clear focus, strong, lengthy examples and sharp conclusions--and it all hangs together as a holistic read. I've seen Seth speak and impressed with his knowledge, creativity and energy, and I'm also aware of his cult-like following. But the pithy sound bites that work so well on stage get old fast after 40 or 50 pages, and simply put, the book just falls short starting with the title (does being a \\"Linchpin\\" really inspire you?) On to the garage sale.

B003EY7IRC|3.0|I think this book was OK!  I have read all of Moning's books/series.  (Even a follower online.)  Loved the Highlander series as well.  This was my least favorite.  Maybe I was expecting more... I, like the rest of her followers had waited over a year for this last book to come out, (I had even pre ordered it) and it just wasn't what I wanted it to be.<br /><br /> For starters, Moning built up the characters so well in the other books that we anxiously awaited the unraveling of them in the final book.  I almost put the book down when she killed Barron's.  I hated/loved this part because we find out later that he is alive.  This was to me one of the best parts of the book.  I did feel that this book should have answered more of the questions already out on the table.  Instead Mac has a lot more questioning throughout the book and leaves us questioning at the end.  I was looking for a finale.<br /><br />I had a feeling that Moning changed her angle of writing as well in this book.  I typically like her style of writing and the use of new vocab is a welcome change.  However, Mac almost had more dialogue within herself than with others.  On another note, I wouldn't have minded the unexpected changes in characters if it had been so drawn out!  I kinda got tired of having to visualize the white mansion.  (Some details could have been left out and it would have been better all around.  I think Moning got a little carried away with this part.)  I got bored with it.  Then the romance between Mac and Barron's finally fully develops and it is another one of the best parts.  Neither of the characters change so much as grow into the relationship.  Then in the end nothing is as it seems and some characters are left flat.  Like the Highlanders.  What about Dani?  We understood that Mac wanted to be normal, but in the end she wasn't and seemed to have come to  excepted who she was.  But really to end with Barron's grilling and mom & dad coming to dinner, just didn't do it for me!<br /><br />Overall it seemed \\"over developed\\" and is not the same quality as her other novels.  I was stretched, pulled and pushed through this one.  It was all up and down and kind of all over the place at times.  It was more or less a let down.seemed \\"over developed\\" and is not the same quality as her other novels.  I was stretched, pulled and pushed through this one.

B00007GZR5|5.0|Williams really bring all of his talents to the table in this absolutely gorgeous film. The effects are absolutely brilliant, and the scenery is stunning, but the underlying story is so passionate and amazing, one really can't miss this film.    It may be rather slow at times, and while it might have served better \\"movie-wise\\" for something to be more fast paced, they worked instead at the feeling of hopelessness as Chris (Robin Williams) searches for his soulmate and wife in purgatory after she killed herself, due to the death of Chris, her husband, and her children.     Feelings against these very mature themes might deter one away from the movie, but if swallowed, this movie can be very heartening to many people.     Definitely recommend seeing this movie. It is not to be missed.

0783225482|5.0|The enjoyableness of this product is kind of perverse, but unquestionable.     From the beginning, the premise seems ordinary enough. On one hand we have a beautiful, popular woman (Madeline) who is also a famous star, and on the other we have the rival woman (Helen) who is rather plain, and because of this has had all of her lovers \\"stolen\\" from Madeline.     However, when Madelin steals away Ernest, her fiance, and marries him, this is the final straw and Helen turns murderous and vengeful. The scary way in which she obsesses about Madeline is not even the movie's most wicked point.     An entire society of people who have regained their youth and never age is the underlying plot as both woman partake in this elixer of youth and gain much more than they bargained for.     Definitely worth the watch and the money amazon is offering for. A definite classic comedy.

Yet he falls in love with the star and stays. This is the simple storyline, which Gaiman expands and embellishes. Written in a florid fairytale prose, the book is an easy and nice read. The scenes and wordings are often very magical indeed. Yet one never really gets rid of the thought that Gaiman sat down and constructed this story: \\"Here is a river, but to say 'River' would have been to bland, no, we call it 'A sparkling stream which had run through the dark forests of Elbion and had touched the fair feet of the maiden of Undragil\\".<br />Thus in summary, a nice read, good entertainment, but do not expect more.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I do minor over clocking and I like my cpu to be cool so the stock fan would not be good enough for me, but I didn't want to pay for big prices on the top of the line coolers. This cooler caught my eye so I decided to try it. I works just fine and cools well but it is BIG. I put it on a I7 on a Rampage III mb. It is very tall, I put it in a full size case and it almost touches the outer panel and it covers up one of the memory slots. So if you want to fill all of the memory slots you can't with this cooler. I only used three slots so it worked for me.
1932100660|4.0|I like the fact that the author calls out people that he believes are a hindrance to getting Americans on track from a health perspective -- and he McDonald's isn't the key culprit.  Doctors, big Pharm, and the government all have their hands in the epidemic.      He does go off the deep end on a few ideas.  Most academics do though.  The desire to have government intervention is never the answer and at times the author suggests that it is.      The title is a bit misleading because the entire book is not about the China Study. Plenty of references to peer reviewed articles give the effort credibility.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Premise<br /><br />9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors (999 for short) is essentially a point and click adventure game with heavy text (or a \\"visual novel\\"). The main character, Junpei, wakes up to find himself trapped in what appears to be an extremely large, old ship.  He and eight others discover have been kidnapped by a mysterious figure named Zero and forced to play the \\"Nonary game\\": A game, in which they have 9 hours to escape by solving elaborate puzzles behind numbered doors or they will die.  They must also follow certain rules that, if broken, will also result in death.<br /><br />Gameplay: 4/5<br /><br />As suggested by the genre, you tap on objects in a mostly still-picture screen, looking for items that will help you escape a specific area of the ship.  You must discover how to use or combine these items to solve complex puzzles.  It doesn't sound like much, but if for those who have never played a P&C game, it can be more engrossing than you think, especially when you're checking every crevice in an effort to find some clue that will help you solve a given puzzle.  As in most P&C games, you don't have many options, but there are a few very significant decisions that will involve determining which door (of the \\"9 Doors\\" in title) you wish to pass through.  A typical playthrough will require passing through 3 doors (NOT in any order, so you don't have to worry about 9 Choose 3 = 84 whopping possible playthrough combinations), and this sequence will determine your ending, though you won't have any idea which one it will be without outside help.<br /><br />Speaking of endings: Multiple playthroughs are not only encouraged, but really required to get the full experience of 999 (explained further under \\"Story\\").  After playing through once, the game will allow you to fast-forward through any repeated dialogue, which is handy not only for quickly getting through some of the more text-heavy sequences, but also for keeping you from missing any new information by accident.  This will be true for all subsequent playthroughs.  Unfortunately, the game will force you to solve the exact same puzzles, likely because there are other dialogue options during these sequences.  This is cumbersome, but having solved them once, you should easily be able to speed through them quickly (or consult a FAQ if you're really lazy).  For example, my first playthrough took me about 7 hours, but most of the subsequent ones took only about 2.<br /><br />Story: 5/5<br /><br />Now, it's possible solving puzzles may not be enough to keep your interest, but as luck would have it, this game features an engrossing plot as well.  As a game, the text-heavy exposition may turn you off at first, but it is written and translated well enough (there are quite a few spelling/grammatical errors, but no outright Engrish).  Maybe it's not Shakespeare, but it's also no Stephenie Meyer or Dan Brown.  If you've ever read a book in your life, then you'll know that words (even badly written ones) can be strong enough to ignite your imagination on their own, so it shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />Much of the intrigue involves discovering why you and your companions were specifically kidnapped as well as the motivation and identity of the game's perceived antagonist, Zero.  The narrative is shaped so that when you pass through a specific numbered door (e.g. \\"4\\"), you will be required to take pre-set companions with you.  This is why the complete experience requires multiple playthroughs: With every new path you take, your companions will offer certain details about their own lives or peculiar observations that will allow you piece together a complete picture of the events.  For instance, if you solve the puzzles in one door with a specific companion, then team up with that companion for a different door, he/she will be more susceptible to offering up new information.  And every ending offers a new perspective on each of your companions.  In fact, you are unable to obtain the\\"True Ending\\" without first completing one of the others.<br /><br />As for details on the actual plot itself, there's an interesting element of sci-fi to it.  You're not going to discover anything crazy like aliens, but the game will attempt to take some real-life myths and offer a possible pseudo-scientific explanation for their occurrence.  As different characters offer you similar explanations for different events, you'll begin to get an eerie sense that your perception of what's possible isn't entirely accurate.  You'll also encounter seemingly disparate motifs that will have you wondering what their connections are.  You'll find that not only does the story ingeniously weave all of these plot threads into a brilliantly told and satisfying conclusion, it also ties the plot to the gameplay mechanics, namely the use of multiple endings and the dual-screen.  This creates a unique experience that would be difficult to pull off in another medium, or even a different videogame system.  Even better, the story isn't deliberately confusing, which some authors, filmmakers, and game designers think is equivalent to \\"depth\\"; you will likely be asking questions at the end, but you won't be scratching your head in frustration, and Aksys has even posted a very informative Q&A session with the lead game designer and story's author on the official 999 site to answer any concerns about possible plot holes and more.<br /><br />The bottom line is, the story will engulf you with the who's, why's, and how's, and the (true) ending will not disappoint the build-up, which when you think about, is a tough feat in and of itself.<br /><br />Presentation & Graphics: 3/5<br /><br />As a P&C adventure game, graphics are not a large concern and there's not too much to look at here.  Most of the backgrounds appear to be pre-rendered, though there are some low-texture 3D objects scattered about.  Very little, if any, animation occurs.  For instance, in the beginning of the game, you'll find yourself in a room where the window has cracked and water begins pouring through...only the water is \\"frozen\\" in time, which looks a little strange and deflates the sense of urgency a bit.  However, the game relies on you to find little details in every area, which the graphics are perfectly capable of relaying, and that's good enough.  The game's locales also do a good job of creating a subtle, unsettling atmosphere; you'll find mannequins, dead animals, torture chambers, coffins...absolutely nothing is graphic (the game refrains from showing you the more gruesome death scenes, although it does describe them in detail), but you will be suitably creeped out.<br /><br />The characters themselves are only shown during dialogue and have few animations.  Hence, the game is more inclined to describe events and body language than to show you.  But as mentioned before, once you start reading, you won't care too much about the unspectacular visual component.<br /><br />Sound & Music: 3/5<br /><br />There is no voice-acting, which may be a pro or con.  I'm not so sure a game like this would've so well with voice-acting.  A bad voice actor for Junpei could've ruined the game and may not be worth the effort.<br /><br />The music, composed by the veteran videogame composer Shinji Hosoe (recent efforts include Tekken 6 and 3D Dot Game Heroes), is geared toward an atmospheric and tense aesthetic to fit with the game's premise and settings, so it's not really suited for casual listening, but it gets the job done well and can be very effective, particularly towards the end when things get heavy.<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 (not an average)<br /><br />You can tell that the game developers put a lot of time and thought into crafting a consistent, engaging plot with multi-dimensional characters, something that is rarely seen in videogames.  The puzzles will keep you entertained, but it's the story that's the real gem here, and it's something that should be experienced by anyone who's interested in more than shooting aliens and Nazis as a floating gun and would like (more) definitive evidence that Roger Ebert doesn't know what he's talking about.<br /><br />As of now, the game seems to have sold pretty well, but I'd personally like a sequel, so buy it new (once it comes back in-stock).<br /><br />Other details:<br />- Total game time for me was about 20 hours for all 6 (really 5) endings.  First playthrough was 7 hours.  Each new Door you encounter will likely take 1-2 hours to complete.  The True Ending can only be obtained after completing another specific ending and is fairly lengthy on its own (about 3 hours).<br /><br />- This game is rated Mature, probably for some graphic textual descriptions of violent scenes and an oddly-placed sexual joke that goes on a little long.  There's no actual sex in it though (pictorial or descriptive).  But 17 is kind of an arbitrary age, and the game is so much more than violence and sex jokes.  I would suggest a parent play this game his/herself and then give it to his kid if he thinks it's okay.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the best book in the Harry Potter book series and one of the best books I have ever read.  Likewise, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 is (so far) the best movie in the Harry Potter movie series.  As of this writing, I am confident that Part 2 will finish the saga nicely, and it will join the ranks of Part 1, to be better than all of the other 6 movies.  (Whether Part 1 or Part 2 is better than the other is less important.)  But my main complaint right now is:    Why is the DVD of Part 1 being released before Part 2's theatrical release?  I expected and hoped that Part 1 would not be on DVD until Part 2 was also ready to be on DVD, and that the two would be released in one DVD as \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\\" without it having to bother with a \\"Part 1\\" or \\"Part 2,\\" or maybe with some minor note mentioning \\"Parts 1 & 2 together.\\"  Either way, I will not own any Harry Potter DVD until all seven episodes (all eight movies) are together in one consistent DVD collection (hopefully including both parts of HP7 in one case within the collection).
0142429104|5.0|I LOVED this book and thought it was insightful, hilarious and touching.  People who are giving bad reviews about this book are doing the writer a disservice, as well as other readers who would enjoy it.  I actually listened to this book on CD, which is read in the writer's voice, not by an actor.  This gives the book the proper perspective because Amy Chua reads it with a wink and a nod.  She GETS IT that people are going to be up in arms about her parenting style.  She is brilliant, honest, painfully funny and brave for writing this book.  Though people may not agree with her parenting style, you would be crazy not to agree that this woman does not love and care for her children.  This is just one woman's interesting perspective and journey through parenthood.  Anyone who reads it will learn a thing or two about how they judge other people and about how they judge themselves.  This book is refreshing and revealing.  Don't let the bad reviews deter you.  Happy reading.
0312370849|5.0|I found this book to be extremely emotional. It's one of those books I just couldn't put down. It was like a history lesson and a novel all rolled into one and I absolutely loved it. It certainly brought me to tears and definitely made me hurt for the victims of the Holocaust.    [[ASIN:1456378643 Connected]]
B003U0AHBO|5.0|i loved this movie. when i was first going to see it i was thoroughly unenthusiastic thinking that we didn't need another Robin Hood movie let alone one with an old Robin.  i walked out eating my words.  it was a wonderfully reimagined take on the story i loved.  Russel Crowe and Cate Blanchett's performances were stellar.  and Kevin Durand was right on.  it was a wonderful film.

0451197968|4.0|This was the first and most likely the last Stephen King novel I'll read. I'd always been curious about King as a writer, but didn't want to read anything gory. I was told \\"The Running Man\\" wasn't, which is true. This novel is a great thriller, well-written, and difficult to put down, but the ending is horribly sad and unsatisfying. What can I say? I like a happy ending, and I don't think King does \\"happy.\\"

B000E41MS6|4.0|I'm not a stranger to the original run of Doctor Who. The original series could be cerebral, charming, and witty. The production values were notoriously bad on the original run, but as George Lucas has proved with his prequel Star Wars trilogy, big budgets aren't everything.    Furthermore, I generally hate time travel in stories. In most cases, the use of time travel is a convenient plot device that opens up several cans of worms that makes the plot unbelievable and contradictory. The writers of this Doctor Who are well aware of this problem. They're also aware that the whole franchise is based largely on time travel. Their solution is one that I approve of: namely, indicate to the audience through clever dialogue that they are well aware of how their writing contradicts last week's episode, but \\"kindly ignore it *wink wink, nod nod*\\". Frankly, it's nice to have the writers admit that sometimes they're trapped, rather than just blatantly insulting the audience's intelligence by pretending that no conflict exists.    I would rate this renewal of the franchise as a massive improvement (I've already insulted fans of the Star Wars prequels, why not go for two and invite howling responses from Doctor Who purists?). Sure, some episodes aren't as good as others, but the highlights from the series exhibit witty dialogue, excellent writing, clever plots, and at their best, genuinely engaging emotional entanglement.    For Doctor Who fans of old, I'd say that if you're willing to adapt, this could be a truly rewarding experience. For those that have never heard of Doctor Who (but like well-written science fiction), I think it would be worth a shot. For those that hated Doctor Who in its original run, I think it may be worth a fresh look.    To me, this is the proper way to refresh a decades old cherished science-fiction mainstay. It is completely unlike the lobotomy that J.J. Abrams performed on the Star Trek series with his reboot of the franchise (there, I've insulted theneo-trekkies as well, that's some kind of trifecta, right?).    I may get around to rating series 2-4, in time, but if I don't, this review stands for all of series 1-4. Eccleston is brilliant as The Doctor. While I initially had reservations regarding Tennant as a replacement, I quickly accepted him as equally brilliant, in his own way, as The Doctor.    Fans would do well to check out Torchwood as well. I haven't seen the Sarah Jane Adventures yet, but would welcome any opinions on it.

B0041CGOZS|4.0|i loved the cd but it was a bit predictable. I never heard one of the songs and I found it odd that it was placed as a \\"hit\\".  It was called \\"No Apologies\\".  After going to their concert back in Feb. 2010 at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA, I am a bit disappointed with this album.  Where is the song \\"Bounce\\"?  That was a hit and should be on the new album.  Although I appreciate the song \\"Born to Be My Baby\\" from 1990, I don't understand why \\"Runaway Train didn't make this cut.  It was a hit in '84 and even afterwards was played extensively on the radio!  After the Circle CD I am a bit disappointed in this CD because I am a huge fan of this group.
B000002KE2|2.0|It's almost impossible to overstate how much I liked Paranoid, and still do. That album has so much style and mood and balance and flow, and most off all it Swings. Yeah, that's right, it swings. It's got that subtle time shifting trick that great jazz is built on and the best dance music shoots for. So that's Paranoid - the original classic of black metal rock - a really cool swinging sound.<br /><br />The problem with this album, Vol.4, is it has \\"fallen off\\" the Swing. It just kinda plods, and thumps, and lurches, and lumbers, like a humongous zombie. Dr. Frankenstein's creation sure is scary but I don't think he's a very good rock & roller. Sabbath had now transformed into an almost lifeless monster - drugs and alcohol had rendered them near brain dead. Vol.4 is very heavy, for sure, as if Sabbath could be anything else, but it just doesn't have that secret mysterious ingredient - lightning?! -  to make the sounds they were laboring over come alive. It grunts then fizzles.<br /><br />There's moments here that hearken back to their better days (just 2 years back!!!); flashes and glimpses of that towering sound that somehow managed to boogie. But it just never holds together, it collapses under its own tremendous weight. Some of Vol.4 is grand and powerful, but mostly it's clunky and repetitious and simple. In the end, like that tragic freak-man assembled in a dungeon laboratory, Vol.4 mostly makes me sad.
B00000DP2V|4.0|I was so happy to finaly find this edition of LZ's CODA at a good price.  Not advertised, but as a bonus suprise this edition is also remastered and sounds great. Fav tract is Bonzo's Montreux.  So sad to have lost JHB too soon.  This last studio album of LZ marked the end of an era.  The golden 60's and 70's which i was so very fortunate to have grown up in with great LZ music soaking into my soul.
B000002KET|3.0|If you like their first album, as raw and uneven as it is, and worship at the holy alter of Paranoid like I do, then I don't see how you can celebrate this album. Their first two albums were so heavy but also managed to swing. Not an adjective normally associated with heavy metal, but Paranoid definitely has a strong swinging quality. By their third one the drugs, alcohol and lifestyle were beginning to show their unfortunate effects. They were getting slow and dull. The magic had slipped away, to be replaced by that too familiar drone and grind of a machine that is just too big and fast for its own good. It's as though they just can't hear the sounds that they themselves are making, they're being drowned out by their own rock stardom. How else did that monumental disaster \\"Fluff\\" con its way onto this album?<br /><br />Sabbra Cadabra has a great groove and good dirty energy but it's just a little too repetitive. In fact, that goes for all of the songs here. What do I mean, repetitive? Well, there are very few surprise turns or resolutions to themes and melodies. It all just keeps restating itself, not bothering to introduce variation and counterpoint - a key element of all their previous best stuff. Metal heads may not be known for their lust for refinement and introspection, but those are precisely the qualities that sets Paranoid apart from the Metal herd. This album, however, doesn't seem at all aware of its overgrown, lumbering, plodding weight. It's an inferior version of something that was once mighty. And truth be told, I don't think any later Sabbath band or album ever measured up to that amazing second album. Ozzie as a solo act did so much awesome stuff, so much magical stuff. And Dio brought fresh energy and style to the group, but Sabbath's best days were behind them.<br /><br />I can feel so many of you aiming your cursors for the \\"No\\" button right now, and that's OK. But before you shoot down my opinion just do yourself one favor. Go back and listen to Paranoid another time. Even if you still think I deserve a \\"No\\" at least you will have enjoyed something really good, something really amazing, unlike this heavy metal dud. Ok, it's not a dud, I do give it 3 stars, but it's no atomic bomb. That's all I'm sayin...her time.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|Loved this movie - I hate animated movies but this one had me within the first few minutes of watching it (usually hubby gets the job of watching the cartoons or animated films with the kids)...   I just loved the simplicity of the movie..He wants to shrink the moon. You can't get much more simple yet complicated than shrinking the moon. Before you know it you are in love with the villian who has a kind heart and a warped sense of humour and three little girls who are exactly like how we would like our kids to be !! :).    My favourite line from Gru is where he is reading the kitten book to the girls and says \\"Wow, this is garbage. You actually like this?\\" which I totally agree with (but don't say outloud) when I am reading to or helping my 5 & 1/2 year old read one of his school books.   Just a brilliant movie with one of the best cast voices and influences I have seen in a long time.
1577314808|5.0|Although the wisdom contained in this book is ancient, I'd never been able to benefit from it until I read Eckhart Tolle's interpretation. Perhaps it's because Eastern philosophy didn't translate well to my Western (American) mind. But by absorbing the message of THIS book, all of the \\"classics\\" suddenly made perfect sense.

0451228375|5.0|This sequel to Ken Follett's epic novel \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" which takes place two hundred years later (1327)is spellbinding.  Once I began reading it I couldn't put it down.  Ken takes you through the lives and tribulations of four childhood friends as events in feudal England unfold and are interwoven with Kingsbridge and it's Cathedral of the same name.  Loves and lost loves, land gained and lost, a plague which cleans out entire villages, revenge and kindness, unforgiveness and consequences years later.  It's real and raw and on the edge so similiar to real life it smarts.

B0032Y8XH8|4.0|My kids brought this CD to my attention just before Christmas (2010) and I've been listening to it pretty consistently ever since.    First, don't buy this album if you are looking for the best, new folk release.  There is better folk out there and this CD really isn't folk.  Folk instruments dominate the songs, but composition (especially percussion) and lyrics are much more European.  Think of it as popular music played with folk instruments.  To this end I don't think the band has tried to sell themselves as the next best folk group, either.    The lyrics are very epic with mortality and religion as common themes.  The content smacks more of medieval \\"Everyman\\" tales than modern themes.  The music, itself, is catchy and pleasant to listen to.  People who are used to bluegrass or folk will find the addition of a full brass section and the heavy drums lacking in the subtlety that they are accustomed to (hence the above warning).        The group has a knack for combining melody and lyrics that makes this a good first outing.  They remind me of \\"The Band\\" a great deal.  I am curious if they will be able to maintain the quality in their next album.  With time I think their lyrics will become more subtle and clever as will their composition.  Hopefully, M.&Sons will be able to keep the balance as their style matures.    Finally, I see that this CD has garnered some criticism for being \\"bombastic\\" and \\"overblown.\\"  Again, subltety is certainly not a trait that I would use to describe this disc.  However,the singer IS quite passionate and brings that element into the songs quite well.        Favorite songs:  Dustbowl Dance - Good build up to a story that could have been part of the Grapes of Wrath.  The jam at the very end is a bit disjointed, but the punctuation from the drums to the narrator's angry conclusion is well done.    After the Storm - Probably the best example of the Everyman theme I mention above.  It's a melodic focus on the helplessness of mortality.  Thesinger's remorse is convincing and this song makes a good \\"last song\\" for the album.    edit - made a few grammatical changes, corrected a typo
B004BBDHEK|2.0|1st of all, I need to clarify that I am a HUGE yanni fan. I began listening to his music since I was 13 yrs old (1998) when I accidentally heard his music through one of my friend's cassette player. I've been in love with his music since. And I would have to say, I love 99% of all the music he created. Albums like \\"Yanni live at the acropolis\\", \\"Tribute\\", \\"In the mirror\\", \\"Dare to Dream\\", \\"In my time\\", \\"Reflection of Passion\\" etc were all GOD like. Absolutely awsome. This guy can blend in music from all different cultures and create multiple masterpeices. However, in the recent years I realized his music is losing it's own identity and classic Yanni feel. Ethnicity, his most recent album prior to Truth of Touch, was only OK to me. I don't hate it, but it was far from the classics produced from the early 90s. When I read online last year that Yanni is returning to create an instrumental album once again, I was hyped. The advertising \\"The return of Yanni as you know him\\" just got me more excited.   But when I finally got to listen to it this morning, I was dissapointed. VERY. None of the tracks were memorable. Most importantly, the whole album just didn't sound....Yanni. All the tracks were plain, and sounded like any average new age albums that are flooding the market these days. I'm not sure if it's the Mexico relating tours that affected him too much, but it sure was a bad influence. I mean, Yanni was a master, he gets inspiration from different music all over the world and does a great job incorporating it. His old album \\"Tribute\\" was so beautiful, blending traditional Chinese and Indian music. Nothing stands out in this album like any of his previous, and it has become at most a background music album to me. I refuse to believe this could be his work...especially after 7-8 years of wait.    Update: Ok, so now I've been listening to the CD for over a week, I guess I'll give it a second opinion.   1st, I apoligize if I sounded like a racist commenting his mexico tour. I by no means have anything or any disrespect for mexican music, buy this I simply was saying a few of his new tracks from this album had the mexican style music mixed into it, and oh well, just happened it wasn't good. My biggest complaint is that it isn't ....Yanni. I have EVERY SINGLE CD & Casette tape that Yanni has ever released. Yanni has his signiture style of music and I'm quite positive I can identify it. For example, a few tracks in this album like \\"Truth of Touch\\", etc still have a little bit of Yanni flavor to it, yes I recognize it. However, even those weren't great. Put these tracks in any of his previous albums, and they will be at most the \\"forgettable\\" ones. None of the tracks in this album have a memorable melody. Now that there's a few more reviews out there, you guys can see I'm not the only one saying this album just doesn't sound \\"Yanni\\". Yanni has a history of using his studio albums as base and create true masterpeice concerts using real musical instruments, like Acropolis. I HOPE yanni steps up and really upgrade this album to another level. Also, please don't let this be his new instrumental album release. He was so damn good between late 80s - 2000. Come back Yanni!     Oh, this might be a personal preference, but I would actually prefer him to grow his beard back too. He had that for so long it has become one of his tradmarks too. :)
B000N6U0EC|4.0|Touching movie, with humor and a great father/son duo from the Smith family. The quality of the BluRay is impeccable and I truly enjoyed this movie. I had it on a 60\\" 1080p screen for about 20 people and they all found the story, image and sound enjoyable. Only comment is that it completely eludes the earlier years of the main character's life (Gardner), which were not so glamorous.. But if you are seeking a good San Francisco movie (there aren't that many) this is a great choice!
0670022411|5.0|One of the best vampire novels I have ever read!    Full of lavish descriptions, yet never too verbose or tedious, this book is a history lover's dream. Harkness' scholarly insights and her stunning descriptions of libraries, ancient books and buildings made me wish I could crawl inside this book and live there forever - her vampires only added to that desire. The very first time we meet vampire Matthew Clairmont is hands down the best introduction to any character in any book I have read. No exaggeration. Her vampires are perfectly sexy, lethal and enthralling.    The plot itself is incredibly complex, yet perfectly crafted, so you are always on the edge of your seat excited to find out what happens next. But best of all is that \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" is believable, from the storyline to the relationships (and romances) between characters - nothing is forced or unrealistically fast.    Excellent read! Can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|Chances are everyone reading my pre-release Truth Of Touch album review today is well acquainted with the man we identify simply as Yanni, and if you are like most people you can vividly recall the very first time you viewed a televised Yanni concert.  Now, can't you just remember the exhilaration of watching this charismatic gentleman touch the lives of people of all nationalities with his music ?<br /><br />Truth Of Touch is truly a passionate reflection of what Yanni does best which is create a personal interaction with an audience through his extraordinary music abilities, and just like those powerful memories of yesteryear the close societal bond is shared by virtue of his magnificent studio version of 15 songs with an over hour long symphony of refined harmony.<br /><br />Truth Of Touch is a Contemporary Instrumental & Electronic arrangement likewise creating a genuine fascination for a multitude of people by being an original composition and direct expression from Yanni himself.  This enthusiasm is not surprising since his last original arrangement Ethnicity from 2003 is an excellent and successful album so it may explain why Truth Of Touch is so highly anticipated among his enthusiastic fan base, along with a vast multitude of people searching for outstanding music that greatly surpasses the everyday ordinary.<br /><br />Yanni is conceivably the greatest influential musician of our time, and while his exceptional abilities as a gifted composer and keyboardist by themselves are a valid testament to his universal appeal, when you factor in the remarkable musicians and vocalists by his side and personal \\"One World, One People\\" vision, the collective inspiration pay tribute to a universal and heartfelt music experience.<br /><br />Yanni Live at the Acropolis began his historic rise to stardom and likely the first time you witnessed his grand entrance onto the world stage since 500 million people from 65 countries have viewed this top fundraising program for PBS.  The album sold 7 million copies worldwide and the music video sold over 1 million copies to become a top selling music video, second only to the Thriller Video by the late Michael Jackson.<br /><br />If you regularly watch the Olympic Games then you know his music scores are presented during international television broadcasts of the Olympic Games since 1988.  He has 35 platinum and gold albums internationally and received 2 Grammy Nominations in the Best New Age Album category, for In My Time and then Dare to Dream, but perhaps of greater importance to Yanni himself are his fans, since after a temporary departure Yanni made a celebrated return to concert tours and producing music due in part to the personal letters from his dedicated fan base requesting encore performances.<br /><br />In fact his global presence has remained strong following the earlier days where over 2 million people in over 20 countries attended a Yanni concert, some of which were held in culturally significant locations like the Tribute Concert venues held at the Taj Mahal in India and The Forbidden City in China, where viewership reached a television audience of 250 million people.<br /><br />Truth Of Touch can be defined by the Contemporary Instrumental, Electronic and Cinematic influences, but what makes this new release special like earlier albums are a wide array of influences, crossing over into Popular, New Age and World music domains.  Truth Of Touch ( Title Song ) begins a memorable introduction to a lavish cascade of midrange keyboard and string sequences set in time to energetic orchestration crescendos and intense timpani drum beats, giving you your first positive affirmation this is indeed an authentic composition from Yanni.  The boldly decisive first song is satisfying to the senses by the majestic intonation, and this is true again regarding the reverberation keyboard melody united with higher octave twinkling notes heard in Echo Of A Dream.<br /><br />Seasons has a lighter keyboard sequence at the onset, changing in dramatic fashion during every refrain by articulated electronics, strings and xylophone notes.  Backed by rhythmic heartbeat percussion, Seasons progresses into a heartening song of inspiration.  Voyage is a fine excursion reaching epic qualities at times where the lighter prelude is forerunner to a spectacular sound adventure created by strings and woodwind orchestration.  Suspended by steady percussion beats, the full instrumentation creates a wonderful sensation of depth.<br /><br />The World ethnicity percussion rhythms and accents with ever changing intervals of harp and cello create a beautiful tribal effect in Flash Of Color, and true again by the voice of a child set in instrumental counter time during I'm So.  Pronounced orchestra and percussion rhythms are a bold source of vibrant energy presented in the upbeat melodic theme of Vertigo.  The vocal melodies on Can't Wait and Secret are definitively two of the more serene songs on the album.  Elegant and passionate, the soprano vocalist delivers her romantic lyrics in a graceful emotive voice which is certain to be a popular collection of contemporary songs for many people.  O Luce Che Brilla Nell'Oscurita is exquisitely imaginative given the theatrical piano, light choir and opera concerto in a harmonious adaptation where the tenor vocalist proclaims his warm and moving declaration of sentiment direct from the heart.<br /><br />Long Way Home has an air of sophistication yet the vigorous piano melody has a peaceful atmosphere at times too, changing from light to more dynamic expressions along the way.  Mist Of A Kiss reveals intricate percussion rhythms having a steadfast effect in the timing of piano chord phrasing, like the piano and percussion cadence heard in the song Nine.  Yanni & Arturo begins with a light trumpet and piano prelude while transitioning into exuberant poetry in motion when glorious soprano vocals and intricate percussion rhythms set the progressive tempo for an improvisational style trumpet solo during which the highest octave notes are reached then extended with astounding precision and clarity.<br /><br />Truth Of Touch is a studio composition of pure refinement, giving one a beautiful impression exactly like the inspiring concert recollections of yesteryear.  The prodigious caliber of musicians Yanni enlists for his projects is boldly demonstrated on what I feel is his greatest instrumental music composition yet.  Perhaps you can tell by now his newest release made me reflect on the personal exhilaration I first felt upon my introduction to his music, and it did inspire me today.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|My grandson is high functioning autistic.  Watching this movie reinforced the ideas I have had since he was 6 that he was going to do some really remarkable things.  He doesn't have the genius that Temple has but his creativity and imagination creates some really remarkable stories which I hope to help put to print some day.  Claire Dane was absolutely fantastic in the roll and I saw so many of my grandson's characteristics throughout the movie.  Thanks so much to the writers and producers of this fantastic movie!!!
B0000DFZZC|5.0|Fans of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy were elated as the 3rd entree \\"Return of the King\\" won just about every Academy Award. Overlooked in all the LOTR madness was my pick for best film of 2003, SEABISCUIT. Its superiority as a film was demonstrated in every area--acting, inspirational story, and technical achievements.  The progression from the prosperous 1920s to the Depression era was beautifully done from the production design to the costumes and just to the feel of the film.  The story and screenplay were so inspirational and moving with Maguire, Bridges, and Cooper all at the top of their game.  Special kudos for the camerawork, the great editing, and the sensitive direction of Gary Ross.  Had I been handing out the Oscars that year, The BISCUIT would have gotten Editing, Screenplay, Cinematography, and Music...as well as best picture.  The final quote always moves me to tears: \\"...everyone thinks we found this broken-down horse and fixed him; but he fixed us, and in a way, we fixed each other.\\" and that's the story!  I don't say this about many movies, but this was an absolutely Lovely film...and so much better than the interminable LOTR3 which won that year.  A word about the Special Collector's set -- There is a souvenir booklet, some postcard of the real characters and the Biscuit, and a 2nd disc filled with documentaries and newsreels of the time.  Definitely worth it for fans of the film.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Growing up, I never quite had the change to listen to that much Michael Jackson. My parents would listen to the classics, of course, such as Abba, Boney M, Gipsy Kings, Nat King Cole, etc. and my brothers and sister were more classic rock fans.  I quickly picked up the best of both worlds, and also started expanding my own music horizons with the greatest, such as Depeche Mode.    Being from Bucharest I always knew that Michael had two concerts here, one in 1992 and one in 1996. When I heard, back in 2005, that the one from the Dangerous Tour was released on DVD I knew I had to watch it, even though I was not a fan at the time. This concert is the reason I became a fan.    Make no mistake. If you are a fan of good music, impecable coregraphy and good shows, you will love this one. Michael is at his top form, performing the best of the best in an unimaginable way. You have got to see it.    Back in 1992, this concert was aired all over the world, including on HBO in the US and still is, to this day, the highest audience in the channel's history for a single broadcast.     There are 3-4 lip-synced songs, one or two of them in order to let him catch his breath for more difficult songs that would follow, and another two because of the coregraphy and the fact that he actually is not on stage in those moments, changing outfits and preparing for the next song.    Words would not do this concert justice, you've got to watch it, end to end and see for yourself the magic of Michael Jackson. No matter what the tabloids wrote about him, what is actually true and what isn't, nobody can deny that he was pure genius on stage and that he is the best.    And that is all that matters.

0439813786|5.0|It's more than just a novel. And it's way more than a picture book. Really...the drawings are a narrative themselves. You have to see the book for yourself. But, what's it about? Twelve-year old Hugo Cabret is an orphan secretly living in the walls of an old Parisian train station tending to the clocks. Hugo's convinced that his father, just before he died, reworked an old automaton to write a specific message just for Hugo. Desperate to decipher the message that he feels will save him, Hugo spends his free time scouring his dad's detailed notebook in order to put the mechanical man back together again. But when the notebook is stolen by a mean-old toymaker in the train station, Hugo's quest becomes much bigger than simply fixing the automaton. A series of events so seamlessly woven together lead to some powerful discoveries. And in the end, the automaton does save Hugo, but not in a way he ever would have imagined.<br />-- reviewed by Kerry O'Malley Cerra
B00436GNVC|1.0|I was hooked by the \\"well well well\\" Video, and as the \\"Rockferry\\" debut CD was simply amazing, I bought the CD without checking the new songs out. Big mistake. While \\"Rockferry\\" had not one weak song, \\"Well Well Well\\" is actually the only one worth hearing, some others are mediocre, some are outright cheesy and embarassing (\\"Too hurt to dance\\" - oh my, that was bad). I hope Duffy gets back on track as she is obviously very talented, her voice is still classy, it is just a poor choice of song material this time.
014241543X|5.0|Every once in a while I come across a novel that is so graceful and so gripping, it consumes me.  For books like these, I'll stay up until the wee hours of the morning just to finish them. And when I'm done, they permeate my dreams by night and by day. Like homemade waffles made from scratch, I savor every word; devour every single bite. Because these are the kinds of books that made me want to be a writer in the first place.<br />Gayle Forman's novel, If I Stay, is that kind of book.<br />Consider, for a moment, if we had a choice: A choice of when to die, how to die, and with whom  to die with. Imagine, if you could chose whether to stay or to go.  Seventeen year-old Mia has this kind of choice to make. But because her mother, father, and little brother have all been killed in the same car-crash that now threatens Mia's life, the choice isn't going to be an easy one to make.<br />It's not like she's the kind of girl who hates her parents and secretly wishes they were gone. On the contrary, Mia loves her tough-chick mom and rocker-band dad. Everyone does. They're super hip in this free-spirited-we-love-you-for-you kind of way, and even her best friend and boyfriend envy Mia because of them. And then there's Mia's little brother, who's she's always had this kind of unbreakable bond with since the day he was born. The whole family is practically perfect. So to stay without them would be unbearable.<br /><br />But then there's Mia's boyfriend to consider. He wasn't in the car crash. He took her to see her music idol, Yo-Yo Ma, on their first date, when he doesn't even like that kind of music. And he, more than anything in the entire world including the success of his own music career, wants her to stay here with him. And so does Mia's adoring grandparents, who have simply lost too much already to lose Mia, as well. And lastly, there's Mia's music--Mia's beloved Cello that fills her soul with everything that's good and possible in the world.<br /><br />So should Mia stay, or should she go?<br /><br />Through If I Stay, Gayle Forman examines tough themes such as the unbreakable bonds of family, the magic (and sometimes limitations) of first love, and the impact one's choices have over the ones we cherish. The movie version, starring Dakota Fanning as Mia, will hopefully display this same kind of poignancy, and grace as Forman intended. If I Stay, as well as Mia's heart-wrenching decision, will undoubtedly stay with me forever.<br />-- Reviewed by Jill MacKenzieThrough If I Stay, Gayle Forman examines tough themes such as the unbreakable bonds of family, the magic (and sometimes limitations) of first love, and the impact one's choices have over the ones we cherish.

B003CLVTZ4|4.0|I picked this double album set up at a record store by my house the other day and I found it to be ambitious to say the least, I mean the nerve of these guys to think they could continue without jim morrison, well after hearing this album I am glad they did. First things first, this is far from a perfect album. What you will experience while listening to this cd is high highs and low lows. The album kicks things off with a song called \\"eye of the sun\\". this number has kriegers twangy guitar a tight groove and ray m. trying to sound like morrison. One thing you will notice is ray way over reaching himself in the singing department but at least he tries. \\"Ships with sails comes next, This is the best song on the album! its mostly instrumental and has an awsome latin groove giving it a signature doors sound. \\"Tightrope ride\\" is a descent rocker with a good krieger solo at the end. \\"Down on the farm\\" is a good song I so wish morrison could have sang. \\"Wondering muscision\\" tries to be signifigant but falls short. \\"Get up and dance\\" is very cheesy. \\"Verdiliac\\" is a funky jam with weird lyrics that would problaly worked better as an instrumental. \\"Good rockin sounds like elvis but road house blues this is not. \\"Mosquito\\" is a quirky song but still highly enjoyable. \\"It slipped my mind\\" is kriegers best song with a good guitar solo. \\"Piano bird\\" is another awesome track that has a laid back feel to it. By now you must get the idea by what I mean when I say this cd has peaks and valleys. I will close with a comment made by another reviewer claiming that this is not the doors. Although I agree morrison played a huge part in the sound and sucsess of the doors, I think this album proves that the doors were not just the jim morrison band.

BUT...  this book is so confusing and the names are so ridiculous and there are so many characters that you learn very little about that you just cannot make sense of the thing.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.. Try the first book at a library and then when you see what I am talking about go get \\"They Way of Kings\\" by Brandon Sanderson, or the three Eragon books by Christopher Paolini if you want good reading that gets you interested in the first dew pages of the FIRST book...<br /><br />Maybe what Steven Erikson really needs is a pony tale and a few cats...

B003Q6D2B4|4.0|There are two things you should know before watching \\"Red.\\" The action-packed film is nominated for Golden Globe best picture for comedy/musical category (and this is not definitely a musical). The other thing is that the action comedy has great players including four Oscar winners (Ernest Borgnine, Richard Dreyfuss, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren). With this stellar cast, things just can't go wrong.    The story itself, loosely based on the graphic novel created by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner, is not original. A retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), now living alone, is suddenly attacked by a heavily armed hit squad. To survive and uncover who is pulling the strings, Frank goes to New Orleans, tracking down the clues while being chased by the current CIA agent William Cooper (Karl Urban) bent on killing him.    Bruce Willis is fine as the retired agent who hasn't lost his touch, but it is Mary-Louise Parker as Sarah, an unsuspecting customer service agent for Moses' pension (and possible love interest), and John Malkovich as Marvin Boggs, ex-spy and conspiracy theorist, who steal every scene they are in. Plus, Helen Mirren firing a machine gun is something you shouldn't miss.     Obviously the film greatly benefits from the talents of the players, who seem having fun. The direction of Robert Schwentke (Flightplan, The Time Traveler's Wife) is not particularly inspired, and the wrap-up is too neat and tidy like the Jodie Foster thriller, but the director keeps the ball rolling throughout. \\"Red\\" is a light-footed action comedy that refuses to be taken too seriously, and is enjoyable as such.

Because I still don't get it. And it's not that I don't appreciate Darkness as a very fine record album. In fact it's got to rank in Bruce's top three all-time best. My point is simply this, if you need almost two hours to explain the thing and use lots of metaphors and analogies to make your point, then maybe you haven't done your job as an artist.

B003Q6D2BE|4.0|As much as I love Warren Ellis, his comic RED (with art by Cully Hammer) wasn't one of my favorites from him.  Red the film on the other hand is a surprisingly enjoyable and breezy comedic action flick that boasts an impressive cast and sharp production values; all of which culminates in a surprisingly good comic adaptation.  Bruce Willis stars as retired CIA badass Frank Moses who, along with his would-be prospective girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker) becomes targeted by his former employers.  Soon enough, Frank enlists the help of some old friends and allies (Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and Brian Cox) as he dodges the determined young agent (Karl Urban) who is hot on his tail.  The breezy nature of Red is what makes it so worthwhile, along with the big-name cast of old pros (which also includes Richard Dreyfus and Ernest Borgnine) who are enjoying every moment of their time here.  All in all, Red is a surprisingly fun comic adaptation that is whole-heartedly worth your time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started this workout video close to three months postpartum with my second child, when I was ready to do a more intense workout but one that had to be short. (I had been doing Erin O'Brien's Postpartum Rescue and going on short walks trying to rehabilitate my posture and lose a little of the baby weight). This is it! At only twenty minutes, I can easily fit this in while Baby is sleeping or wiggling on the floor watching me exercise.<br /><br />For beginners (or workout wimps like me :)), Jillian gives some modifications for the exercises. In a tough voice she says there are no modifications for jumping jacks (in the first workout) because she's got \\"400 pound people who can do jumping jacks; so can you.\\" I wanted to say, but what about us postpartum mommas with no belly muscles?? I made up my own modifications to work up to a full jumping jack: do side steps or jumps instead of a jumping jack, do jumping jacks with no arms, do jumping jacks with arms raised half-way, and then do the full-on jumping jack.  Other modifications to try with the exercises in the video: use no arm weights, use soup cans, use 1 lb weights, use 2 lb weights, and so on.<br /><br />After doing the workouts for a month, I wish I could say that I have lost all the baby weight (or 20 lbs like she advertises on the DVD case), but I have not. I have, however, improved my posture, strengthened my abs and arms and legs, and feel more stronger and more energetic overall (despite still being sleep deprived because of the new baby). I like this workout because I don't have to use any mental energy to keep up with the routine, the exercises change enough that I don't get bored with what I'm doing, and best of all, it is intense and short. My body is improving because of this video. Thanks Jillian!!
0385528752|4.0|After dealing with a whole slew of recent bad luck, I needed something to help me get back into the groove of things. I decided to get the help of a few friends who all recommended this book. I'm not all the way through it yet, but so far it's been a great read!
1594202842|1.0|It is quite clear that Amy Chua grew up to be the person her parents wanted her to be. In turn, she insists her girls to grow up to be who she wants them to be. Absolutely no thought is given to what her daughters might want, or that they will grow up in a different world than their mom did.     If you want to break your childrens will, this is the book for you. Just be forwarned; Cowed children grow up to be cowed adults. The book makes an interesting confession piece, (without any remorse) but as a parenting guide it is all wrong.     Brian K.
B001E57SH8|2.0|This lighter does work ok, but as stated it eats up butane and doesn't light all that reliably. I am not a smoker but got this intending it as a dependable camping lighter, but I feel much more confident about using a bic or a book of matches. Also, I was burning through flints, so I ended up just taking apart a dead bic lighter and used that flint, it now works much better, but not as good as a $50 dollar lighter should.
0060899220|5.0|Frankly, I didn't have high hopes for this book because I find Tony Bourdain to be a bit of egotist.  However, I was surprised that he came off sounding very humble, and also very appreciative of chefs with more skill and knowledge than he.  His writing is delightfully entertaining in every way.  I looked forward to picking it up each night and stayed up far later into the night than I ever meant to!
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I love this series and have watched it many times on DVD, but recently ordered it on Blu-ray. It's absolutely stunning! If you don't already own the series, splurge for the Blu-ray if you have the means to play it, and if you already own Pride and Prejudice on DVD, it's well worth the money to add the Blu-ray to your collection.
1596680296|5.0|This is the book to buy.  Never knitted anything but scarfs and hats, ventured into shawls, vests, wanted to knit socks...  read the reviews of this book on Amazon and bought the book.  I have knitted 4 pair of socks to date.  I am very pleased.  I started with basic socks on page 12 going to page 45.  I did one thing different, I did k2p2 ribbing for 7inches as my husband wanted ribbed socks...  I made a pair of red using 2 strands of poly type yarn, great hiking boot socks..  thick..  then white wool, 1 strand for atheletic socks, then blue poly hiking boot socks for me and now I have the confidence to knit with that skinny stretchy sock yarn and finished with a pair of pedicure socks... open toe...  This book lives up to it's 5 star review.  [...].  I love knitting socks... it's a small project to knit a sock..  easy to carry with you..  Seems difficult at first so the first sock takes a week.. the 2nd sock 3 days..  and now I can knit a sock in 1 1/2 days..  so easy to do a pair a week.  Stop putting off knitting socks and buy this book... go for it.. you won't regret it.
030745455X|5.0|WOW This was a fantastic read. In a way, I am glad I could not read it at one sitting.  It was way too intense for that. But drop everything and READ THIS BOOK. I am going to have to wait until my blood pressure gets back to normal before I tackle \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.\\" But after all, anticipation is half the fun.  ENJOY.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|There are few artists that bring me so much that I say that I love them. Listen to, like, maybe even enjoy but love... Florence is one of these artists. Everytyhing about her from her amazing vocals to her personality, fun and life-loving makes you fall in love. She bares her soul on this record and if you let her in, you'll fall in love too.

0345409671|2.0|Of all the Rice books I have read, 'Memnoch The Devil' is my least favourite. I had read up to 'Tale of the Body Thief' and really enjoyed them all. Then somebody lent me 'Pandora', and she mentioned 'Memnoch' and the plight of Lestat. I rushed out and bought it to find out what had happened to him but I couldn't get into the book and skipped on to 'The Vampire Armand' Unfortunately, there are lots of references to Lestat and Memnoch's 'adventure' at the beginning of Armand's book too so I admit to skipping through 'Memnoch' to get the gist and then reading the last couple of chapters to hear Lestat summing up. If this book had not been referred to in both 'Pandora' and 'The Vampire Armand', I would say skip it, but in my case I felt left out so that's why I read the bits I did.   Somehow, 'Memnoch The Devil' just did not have the depth of character of the other vampire chronicles. Even 'Pandora', which everyone here seems to have hated, was a delight to me due to the depth of characters. I felt no affinity with Dora at all and could not understand Lestat's love for her. Also, Lestat seemed to be different in this book, not like himself.   I quite liked the beginning, with the stalking and the tale of the ghost at the bar but once the crazy journey began, I couldn't keep up and was left in the dark feeling like I'd picked up some text book about various beliefs on evolution, god and the devil by accident.  Frankly, this book bored me.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|Got this as a gift for someone who wanted it. Upon receiving it, they said they were surprised to find out that the humor in it is entirely tied to just how serious it takes itself. We were expecting a survival guide that was funny in its content, rather than funny in its sincerity.
B000ZNQEMU|5.0|This was a gift for someone. When I saw it I thought it was very cool.  But later I saw that maybe some pieces had fallen off. It is basically a real lego figure on a chain, so I guess you can't expect it to last forever. I would order it again.
B003Q6D25K|1.0|Im the kind of person that likes just about every movie even if they arent any good.  I own well over 700 dvd's and about 100 blu-rays so when friends invited me out to see this movie in theaters I figured why not?  I love the horror genre and the trailers made it look plenty creepy.    Well I wasted my money.  The movie is basicly an hour of nothing happening then small oddities occur followed by about 10 min of weird \\"scary\\" stuff and then its over.  The movie is just a bore and its sad because it had potential.  I dont really see how anyone could enjoy it.  My description above is accurate.  95% of the movie is NOTHING and the last 5% is suppose to be scary but its just not.  Right as things start to get where they should be the movie just ends.
1405240474|2.0|Insanely overpriced for a bunch of poorly illustrated pamphlets.  The books are small and flimsy, children will tear them apart easily.  A set like this would be an OK deal for $50 at most, but not ~$150.  Nostalgia is the only reason to get these.  You'll get more for your money with regular children's books like Curious George or Dr. Seuss.
031603438X|5.0|It's a must-read for music fans and musicians and anyone interested in the 60s and 70s, the way the world was changing and the way the change was heralded by rock and roll. Keith captures it all, as well as being charming and funny, risque and out there, he was intelligent and paying attention. He marvels at a group of legal types who sit down with the Stones and ask them what they want, for all the world as if they are dangerous revolutionaries. Then he expounds on the benefits of 5-string open G tuning. I only wish this book came with MP3s so we could have examples of all the music and the chords he is playing, and also of his musical inspirations and sources. I can Google them, but I can't find the exact sounds Keith is referencing. There's a lot of personal detail, too, his life and loves, but he never once loses his focus on his music. Inspiring, and amazing, the time he and Mick spent on creating that sound. This book is everything it should be.
B002GDM2UA|4.0|I saw this when it came out and greatly enjoyed it.  It is fantasy with great acting and a fun story, the confrontation of good and bad immortals and what it will mean for humanity.  It is right along the lines of Star Trek scenes, where if you are a bit sentimental and can let yourself get lost in it, it is great while it lasts.  Even after 25 years, I can say that stands the test of time, in particular because of the warm role of Connery, the reluctant hero (Lambert), and the lonely idealist police chick.  The bad guy is also a wonderful evocation of chaos, the other path that humanity could go down.  Now, my kids enjoy it too, though it is a bit gory for them.<br /><br />My criticism is that the blu-ray version that I got - the one with the word in the cover, not the 2-disk edition - is not any better as a print than a normal DVD, with the exception of a few choice panoramic scenes; otherwise, it is surprisingly grainy, truly inferior for blu-ray format.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I will watch this many times, no doubt.  Recommended.
1439133948|5.0|Has it been eight years since Lois McMaster Bujold has visited the Miles Vorkosigan universe? Looking at my review of the last book, Diplomatic Immunity, it seems that it has. Fans have patiently waited as Bujold pursued other, more fantastical interests, always hoping that one day she would come back to the pint-sized cyclone of chaos. Cryoburn is like streaming water from a garden hose onto somebody who's been on fire for years: a true relief. Has she lost her Miles touch? She hasn't. In fact, this one is much better than the last Miles book, which was a good, but not great, send-off.<br /><br />Seven years after the events of Diplomatic Immunity, Miles has a growing family back home on Barrayar. However, his position as Lord Auditor for the Emperor Gregor, galactic problem-solver for Barrayar's interests, has brought him to Kibou-daini, a planet heavily invested in cryogenically freezing the dying. Ostensibly attending a convention on the planet, Miles hopes for a bribe attempt from one of Kibou-daini's massive cryonics companies which may be making a move on Komarr, one of Barrayar's planets. He gets more than he bargained for, however, as he stumbles upon another, far more sinister scheme. With the help of a young boy whose mother was taken away and frozen eighteen months ago, Miles must get to the bottom of what's going on. Corruption, kidnapping, illegal freezing - Miles has to learn quickly and try to stay one step ahead of the scheme, or it will roll right over him.<br /><br />Bujold slips into her Miles glove with ease, this light-hearted (yet fairly serious) adventure showcasing just how flexible her writing style is. Her ability to highlight serious topics while keeping the reader engaged is right up there with Pratchett's, though their styles are much different. Bujold closely examines the details and controversies that might arise when cryonics are common, including things like the voting rights of the frozen and the logistics of when and how they are to be revived. It helps that Miles has been through the very same thing after taking a needle grenade blast to the chest, so he's able to understand some of the intricacies that other laymen might not be able to.<br /><br />Cryoburn is a return to form for Bujold as far as Miles goes. The previous book didn't contain the gentle humor that the series has always been known for - it was pretty light, but it wasn't humorous. This book definitely has the humor touch. The wry observations of Miles' armsman, Roic, regarding the situations Miles is always getting himself into, or the dignified horror of Vorlynkin, the head of the Barrayaran embassy, when he gets his first taste of how Miles does things, add to the general tone of the book.<br /><br />Bujold manages to wring a lot of drama out of the story, too, despite the fact that Miles is never really in any danger, other than of his plans perhaps falling to pieces around him as he desperately tries to improvise. The young boy, Jin, is in more danger; he ran away from his aunt and uncle's house after his mother was taken away and frozen. He's been living in a kind of commune of other unfortunates on Kibou-daini, along with his menagerie of animals.<br /><br />Bujold's world-building is once again top-notch (she's had a lot of practice in that). The society on Kibou-daini is very interesting, with the extensive interest in cryonics and intricate political system of how those who have chosen to be frozen are still not disenfranchised. We see the underbelly of Kibou-daini, those who get by on their wits, but we also see how the cryonic conglomerates work. It's all very neat.<br /><br />But it's the characters that make or break a Miles novel, and that's where Bujold excels. Cryoburn is littered with interesting characters. Miles is his normal, almost-manic self. Roic is picture-perfect as both Miles' servant and confidant. The Barrayaran embassy staff, the cryo-technician Raven who provides Miles with the cryonic expertiseduring his investigation - all are presented without a weak note. Bujold even throws in a couple of twists character-wise that will leave longtime fans giddy.<br /><br />The only strike against Cryoburn is that a major event in the Miles universe is relegated to an aftermath section, literally begging for a follow-up that I hope Bujold will explore. And soon. It seems out of place in this novel, unless an immediate sequel is planned. Yes, one can make the case that it does follow the theme of the novel, but it still comes out of left field.<br /><br />Long-thirsty Miles fans can finally take a much-needed drink. Miles is back. Can we clone Bujold to make sure that she never leaves him again?<br /><br />Originally published on Curled Up With A Good Book. © Dave Roy, 2011hout a weak note.

B0016PM722|5.0|Very Cool Lightsaber! My son, who is 9 loves it. But it is more of a show peice than something that can be played with on a regular basis. Works and looks just like you would imagine a real light saber to. Overall, if you are big into Star Wars it is definately worth the money!
B002VECLVY|5.0|I love this movie. Its just beautiful visually and lovingly. Colin Firth is excellent and he broke my heart ( in a good way ) and Matthew Goode is beyond \\"good\\" and just keeps getting better every time I see him. He is such a pleasant surprise. What a great cast and Tom Ford, WOW! What a promising future in film.
B004HAEGP4|2.0|Any ties to reality that you may remember from original Resident Evil movie have officially been purged from the series with this sequel.  The action is so preposterous and tacky that it's painful to watch, and the plot itself is no better.  Every wording and phrase comes off as pretentious - you can tell that they were trying to get a specific vibe for the series, but it it's impossible to feel any sympathy for Alice and cohorts as characters.  There's no tension, and thus no real horror; it's a superficial action flick with sci-fi elements have have completely fallen off the rails.  It's a train wreck, and I advise that you completely avoid this film.  I gave it two stars because the effects used are decent, and I suppose you'll like it if only for the dash of violence between the utter \\"suck\\" the rest of the film is.
0470449748|5.0|I like this book as it provides me the basic infos I need to know about GMAT. It also has quite many practice problems.
B0025X4P56|5.0|Absolutely love the straightforward lyrics and no messin' approach of the music. It has a directness and emotional honesty right at the heart of what rock music is all about. About not getting the girl or maybe even being on the verge of success....correctly billed as songs of desire from a 'wolf man' LOL This is really encouraging for those who fear the album is dead. Here's an example of one that hangs together from beginning to end. It is short, tuneful and the vocals perfectly suit the material. I'm actually surprised although i have no idea why. surprised i can actaully like an album like this in 2011. surprised and happy to listen.
B0046MOVD0|3.0|This is not an awful movie.........the blu ray version is quite lovely.........but I think this should be the last in the series....it lacks originality, and the characterizations are now somewhat tired.  As the actors go through their paces, I found myself less drawn into the drama than I was on the first three films.  It is a reasonable action adventure, well shot, reasonably well paced...just sort of tired.  Those of us who love the franchise may be somewhat disappointed, but still should buy this movie...if only for closure.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a few years.  No violence, no sex, no hatred, just life as it should be.
B002ZG98CS|5.0|My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this...we are both Robert Rodriguez fans........and really enjoy his usual cast of characters over and over again.  Machete is overblown, and sometimes a bit ridiculous.........but so full of life and fun, that we will watch this video over and over again.  The violence is amazing, but not so graphic that it seems real....after all, this movie really is a sort of fantasy.  Our blu ray version was totally beautiful, and pointed out how well Robert Rodriguez crafts his art.  Danny Trejo is always enjoyable, and we were very glad to see him get starring status in this film
B003UCPEJ2|1.0|I did a search for SACD collection and this was the #1 result of the search. Unfair advertising. I'm even noticing that the tag suggestions for this item include \\"rca living stereo hybrid-sacd\\" Boo Amazon, boo.
B001P06GX4|4.0|I bought this as a late Christmas present.  I played it for the first time 3 years ago and really enjoyed the challenge of piecing the puzzle together.  At first, I thought it was up to chance, but the guys I played with soon figured out that if you start with a certain piece, you will always win!  Good luck figuring that out!
0307472590|4.0|Este es un muy buen libro, yo nunca había leído nada de este autor cuando compré el libro, me pareció muy bueno, al inicio en cierta forma me aburría pero conforme iba avanzando se iba poniendo cada vez más interesante hasta que al final me encantó.    Una muy buena historia!
0385737955|3.0|I was told to read this if I liked \\"The Hunger Games\\".  I enjoyed this book, but found I was looking for a comparison.  There are similarities, but the story line is different.  I wouldn't recommend this reading to children under 12 if you are worried about language (the author uses other words that are easily translatable to curse words/slang) but otherwise it is a fun adventure and an easy read.

B000001GY9|5.0|from this era, my favorite is tchaickovsky, others i consider them secondiers, i have also his serenades & hungarian dances, so i can't tell that i don't like him, but it doesn't lift my back hairs when i listen to him or hum it as i do with any piece by tchaickovsky. even so it deserves 5 stars as a rate because they are masterworks.
0316098337|3.0|I had high hopes for this book, but it fell flat. The second half of the book is when it finally started to get good. It is written from the viewpoint of a child, including the language. It took me quite a while to understand what somethings meant. It was really slow in the first half, which should have been the best half.
B0000DGDOJ|4.0|you have to be a very big fan of silver convention (as i am) to get this album. it has all the misses & B sides that you can expect. the versions are the album lenght, i already have the 12\\" versions of the greatest hits. they are easy to find., but if you're a true fan of silver convention, you have to have heart of stone & old wine in new bottles. oh! when you look in the picture the timing of telegram. is not 2:56, is 5:25, the complete long version in the album. i guess is a misprint.<br />ps.<br />i've done my research & this album has the complete discography of silver convention, les 4 minor songs that come in the golden girls album, the less interesting of all of them
B0027REDK2|3.0|the hard cover book was nice to have. but not the paper sleeve the cd goes into. it could scratch the disc. the uk version on disc 1, the remastering was perfect. but the us version could have had more attention in remastering. it sounded bunched up instead of seperated. then there were 3 versions of hold back the rain. which we get the original uk version and the long lost us version. the one from the 2001 cd is not on this set. i liked that better than the uk version. so i keep both cd's. if you have the 2001. it's best to upgrade to this one for the sound of the uk version. my favorite is rio-uk, my own way-uk, lonely in your nightmare-us, hungry like the wolf-uk and either the 2001 hold back the rain and the us long version.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Product as represented, good shipping time.  This was a Christmas present for my step-mother who loves Celtic music.  I bought it specifically because it had a lovely recording of a version of \\"Isle of Inisfree\\" which she and my father fell in love with after watching the John Wayne film set in Ireland, \\"The Quiet Man.\\"  I've since been told my step-mother enjoys listening to it while in the bath.  Perfect gift for a Celtic music lover.
B000002KDO|5.0|Ozzy is a God. Amazing vocals and very warm feelings by the music. The first five albums with Ozzy are all amazing and will last eternally. It the something that makes this album unique. You can hear this album many times without getting bored. The original Black Sabbath are one of the master bands in the world and in the metal scene. Personally i liked very much the ballad Solitude -> its a unigue ballad (i haven't heard anything like this.)
B004HEXSLI|4.0|I am an undergraduate student taking a course in Clinical Neuropsychology. We read this book as well as a textbook chapter on the organization and function of the brain. In the textbook chapter we learned about the functions, capacities, and responsibilities of structures in the brain. However, this book provided a firsthand account of the importance of these structures, as well as what happens when they are compromised. It truly helped me gain a deeper appreciation for this amazing organ. From the textbook I learned that the left hemisphere is responsible for \\"'linear' processing of sequentially presented stimuli such as verbal statements, mathematical propositions, and the programming of rapid motor sequences\\" (Lezak et al., 55). To all those who can read, this information seems to make enough sense. However, in this book, Jill Taylor explains not only what it feels like to lose the ability to process information linearly, but also she explains the difficulty of regaining these abilities. Her detailed descriptions of the reactions of those around her, her own personal reactions to novel situations, and the new perspective she gained after this whole ordeal were invaluable in educating me about the real-life effects of strokes. It helped me to appreciate the complexity and intricacy of the human mind and its resilience to trauma. After reading this book I realize that understanding what happens physically, psychologically, and neurologically when one experiences a stroke is equally as important as understanding what happens emotionally, spiritually, and cognitively.     It is important to note, however, that no two brain injuries are the same and that what was experienced by Jill Taylor may not be experienced by another brain damaged individual, even one with a similar injury. Taylor's stroke occurred in her left hemisphere and compromised several specific areas of the brain. The areas effected and the order they were effected in, created a unique experience. Whatshe felt (dissociation from reality, coordination malfunctions, auditory problems, and many other effects) indicated the deterioration of her mind and the areas that experienced trauma and the order in which the trauma was experienced created a unique alternate reality for Taylor. Another aspect to consider when comparing Taylor's stroke to similar brain injuries is her unique perception of the situation. As a trained neuroanatomist, Taylor, even while experiencing serious brain trauma, was able to recognize to some extent the severity of the situation. She was able to realize that what she was seeing, feeling, and hearing were possibly a result of damage to her brain. Even short of accepting her scientific interpretation as an argument for the uniqueness of her experience, her interpretation as an individual human being would render her experience much different from anyone else.     However different or similar Jill Taylor's experience is to another stroke victim, it is clear that her explanations, from the trauma itself to the process of recovery, can provide many people with insight as to the struggles and joys of experiencing brain trauma. I know that for myself, this book opened my eyes to the importance of patient care, attitude, and patience when dealing with someone who has experienced brain damage. It also gave me a better idea of how amazing the human brain is and reading this book encourages me to take control of my thoughts and to experience life the way I want to, not the way I feel I have to.
B000000QFV|4.0|This album does not reminds classic Black Sabbath at all. I prefer the classic but i have to say that this album is very good. ITs a metal album with very good music and vocals. All the songs gives a very good ambient and atmospheric mood with excellent vocals . The feeling is amazing. I suggest this album to all metal fans
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Movie is great, no doubt about it. But packaging is really nice. It comes with a 2nd disc full of extras (which I'm not a big fan of).
B004FEFZU2|3.0|I have enjoyed the Saw series for some time but the specialty of the series is definitely worn off. I've felt this way for the last couple of Saw movies but thought I would give this one a buy for the 3D effect since there are so few 3D movies out. The movie was just OK. I will most likely not watch it again but I am not an uber fan. It has it's twists and the scenarios are original and a throwback at the same time.<br /><br />3D- I would rate the 3D effect at a 3. There were times that it was really neat but they were very few and far in between. It lacked the depth I've seen in other live action 3D films. There were times with the lighting that it completely washed the scenes out and I thought it was completely unacceptable.<br /><br />Bottom Line. If your a Saw fan you probably aren't reading this and you probably already have the movie. If you are still interested I would say rent it.
1440503257|5.0|This was a gift for one of my daughters, and i thought there was going to be fight b/c two daughters (grown) wanted it.  They read it cover-to-cover on Christmas day, and the entire family enjoyed hearing many excerpts.  It certainly added to our Christmas fun.
B003Q6D1Z6|1.0|I saw the trailer for Catfish last summer.  Anybody who's watched the preview will tell you that it starts out telling you about some bland online romance that takes a bizarre twist when the two decide to meet in person.  And that's where the trailer leaves you.  It has the unmistakable vibe of a suspense/thriller movie.  Even the movie poster LOOKS like there's going to be suspense; and of course, the tagline:    \\"Don't let anybody tell you what it is.\\"    That tagline is genius for two reasons.  One, it tells you that you're in for a clever twist, which piques your interest.  And two, it insulates you from reviews, and the opinion of anybody who's seen it for fear of blowing the surprise.  They don't want anybody to tell you what it is, because you wouldn't bother seeing it if you knew.    I'm not going to blow the twist, because surely some people will enjoy this movie.  This is assuming that they aren't expecting the movie that was advertised.  This movie was like embarking on a treasure hunt.  It's an incredibly tedious journey, but you stick with it because you're expecting a huge payoff.  But the roundabout journey ends up leading you right back to where you were in the first place, and the treasure is 5 feet away from where you found started.  And the treasure is a $5 gift card for Subway.  And it's only valid for their weird breakfast menu.  And it's expired.

B002VHI8FE|4.0|Just to be clear, this review is specifically for the Kindle edition. Thus, while I thoroughly enjoyed the story, I'm going to concentrate in this review on how it was adapted to the Kindle format.    This is one of the first books I bought for my Kindle, several months ago, and thus it took some time for me to compare it with other Kindle editions and realize how poorly it was adapted to the Kindle format. Every paragraph skips several lines between them, something entirely unnecessary when the first line of each paragraph is indented. Since the chapters are split into sub-chapters by skipping an extra line between paragraphs, it is quite difficult to tell when a new sub-chapter begins, as adding a single line more is nearly impossible to notice when each paragraph already has such wide gaps between them. Sometimes there is an asterisk in these gaps to indicate a new sub-chapter; usually there isn't. The first line of the new sub-chapter isn't indented, but this often evades notice, and thus the reader is left confused by a sudden shift in scene or point-of-view.    In addition, there are numerous typos in the Kindle edition, usually in the form of random characters inserted in the middle of sentences or even words, such as a > mark from out of nowhere, or a capital T in the middle of a word. I doubt very much that these are present in the print editions.    The good news is that the publisher could fix these problems and reissue the Kindle file, allowing those of us who purchased the book to redownload it. I hope they will do so. The second book in the series, Before They Are Hanged, suffers from the same problems. This is too good a series to be adapted to Kindle in such a slipshod manner. Publishers, you can't just take a file, run it through a converter, and send it to Amazon. Adapting a book to the Kindle takes some attention and proofreading at the very least.    So, to sum up:  Story: 5 stars  Kindle adaptation: 2 stars

B0049P1ZZQ|2.0|The Walking Dead is one of my favorite comic books of all time. In an age of \\"event\\" comics where trademark characters are killed only to be retconned (for those of you that aren't comic book nerds, that's retroactive continuity, an intellectually lazy way to explain past events that don't make any sense given the current situation. A good example would be a character coming back to life after being killed only to find out it was his twin brother that died, a character you've never seen nor heard of before) because real death would cost too much money, a world in which \\"no one is safe\\" is appealing. The Walking Dead is as close as you can get to a real world tale of a zombie apocalypse. There is no morality, there is no good, there is only survival for you and your own.    Now, flash forward to the Walking Dead TV series. After an incredibly strong pilot episode, things just go downhill. One of the things the comic does extremely well is the ever-present danger that the dead pose. You can blink your eyes and get attacked. That simply isn't the case in the TV show. The survivors, while not totally safe, rest near the rock quarry like they're on a camping trip. They do laundry, they fish, they talk (ad nauseum), they shout...not counting 1 major event, I can only recollect 1 scene in which a walker is even near the campsite, and it is quickly and silently dispatched by Daryl. Not only is an apocalypse an easy situation to build suspense, but the writers simply seem like they weren't even interested in trying.    Now, I didn't expect a tit-for-tat adaptation, nor did I necessarily want one. However, for a 6 episode season, an inordinate amount of time is spent on inconsequential plot devices. I'm speaking primarily about the final episode. We get this long explanation about how the virus works. Why does it matter? Whether it is an act of God, a biological weapon, or anything in between, it doesn't change the situation one bit: the civilized world, as you know it, is over. The tagline for the comic is \\"In a world ruled by the dead, we are forced to finally begin living.\\" Not \\"in a world ruled by dead, a small group of survivors hunts for the cure to an extinction event\\". The reason the Walking Dead has done so well as an independent creator-owned comic (an INCREDIBLY rare occurrence) is because we see ourselves in the book. How would we deal justice in this world? If someone steals food, a benign crime today that can kill everyone in this world? Do you warn them not to do it again? What if they don't listen? These are the things we never hope to have to decide, let alone see their horrible ramifications. I waited to see these hard decisions, not only for those who were put into them but also to see the impact on the group. What I saw were few decisions, let alone any with negative ramifications for the group, which seemed incredibly passive as those things happened. One can only hope that in season 2 one of the group gets infected and as they waste needed food and medical supplies on a lost cause it turns around and bites them, literally.    Now, I can write off some of this to a show simply getting its bearings. Some of my favorite shows had terrible first seasons. The U.N gang watching their grandmas? A white trash wife beater and his kind-hearted wife that makes every excuse she can think of? A pair of racist, redneck brothers, one of which is named Meryl? A near rape and near execution from a guy that 10 minutes earlier was the just, strong group leader? And T-Dog? T-DOG?!??!?! An \\"Urban\\" character with a fashion sense that looks like he was plucked from a Wayans brothers movie shot in 1992. Who the Hell introduces himself as \\"T-Dog\\" during the zombie apocalypse? This is just lazy, lazy writing.    When I read that they fired the entire writing staff I thought maybe the higher ups saw how in the long-term people will pick up on these ridiculous characters and situations, but it turns out that was a false rumor. I can only hopethat season 1 simply had a ton of growing pains that they can work out and season 2 starts with a massacre of terrible characters that no one gives a damn about.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I just started watching Modern Family this season and had to see more.  The first season is so funny.  I laughed so hard.  My husband is even starting to watch it and he doesn't usually watch t.v. shows.  He loves Phil and can relate to him the more than the other characters.  I love Cam the best he makes the show!
1601251505|4.0|I'm updating an old review of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook. In short, after having played the game, I find it to be just as flawed as the Dungeons and Dragons version it was meant to replace. There are some worthwhile improvements, but Pathfinder feels more like D&D 3.75 rather than a full reboot. This review assumes you are familiar with the D&D 3.x line of products (D&D versions 3, 3.5).<br /><br />Character Creation / Paging Back-and-forth:<br />It's a mess. For example, each race has a one-page rundown and stat box. This looks great, but most of the space is taken up by flavor text, so a lot of necessary statistics get left off. Tables giving you the average height and weight of your race are buried halfway through the book in a miscellaneous-type section and can only be found by referring to the index. This is a general complaint with the book, as you will often find yourself paging back and forth because rules are spread between sections.<br /><br />Skills:<br />Pathfinder leaves some classes with 2/level, which effectively means those classes can choose between spending all their points in a couple of skills necessary for battle, or be weaker for spreading the points around. Pathfinder does attempt to fix some skill issues, such as uniting Listen/Spot/Search skills under one all-encompassing Perception skill. The problem is, this essentially means Perception is worth several times what you spend. There's no good reason why any party wouldn't have at least one character maxing out their perception every level, if not the whole party. If you have two skill points, you put them in Perception.<br /><br />Class Tiers / Balance:<br />With a very few exceptions, the tiers of power in D&D 3.x are unchanged. Spellcasters such as Wizards are absolutely superior to Fighters. A simple proof of is, at almost any level, a Wizard can use a Summon spell to bring forth any variety of monsters that can best the fighter's damage output- and those monsters often have extra bonuses such as their own spellcasting, or flight. The Fighter's Will save is the worst in the game, so the party is only ever one mind control spell away from losing their swordsman. The balance is a little closer at low levels just because Wizards have a limit number of spells they can cast per day, but a smart Wizard can still end an entire battle with one first-level spell. There is absolutely no balance between classes, and the differences grow as levels increase.<br /><br />Capstone Abilities:<br />Each class has a \\"capstone\\" ability, an additional bonus for hitting Level 20. Some classes get ridiculously better capstone abilities than others, and these differences generally only make the tier problem worse. A fighter's capstone ability is that he can never be disarmed by an enemy against his will. Which sounds great, except that an enemy spellcaster can target the Fighter's puny Will save, and command the Fighter to drop his weapon. Or cast a rust spell, that destroys his weapon. Or they could summon a demon that can flatten the fighter in one hit. Or... you get the idea. Compare this to the Bard's capstone ability, in which the Bard puts on a musical performance that can slay his audience.<br /><br />Why is this in here / What's not in here:<br />The Pathfinder Core Rulebook is huge. As an example example, the book includes lists of magic items. There's a whole system in D&D/Pathfinder where magical items are supposed to be found during adventures with little other than their physical description available, then the party has to make rolls to identify and use those items. When players can just flip to the back and pick the item out of a list, a lot of that fun is ruined. Not included, for example, is a list or system for building traps. Traps are common to most dungeon-crawler adventures, yet traps are only thoroughly defined in the Dungeon Master's Guide. So despite having to lug around a massive Core Rulebook, you really cannot play a whole game out of that onebook.<br /><br />The One Really Good Thing:<br />Pathfinder does make combat a much faster affair, in terms of setting up a battle and moving turn-to-turn. A great example is that actions such as tripping or grappling have been unified under a Combat Maneuver system, which is basically just an alterante attack bonus (CMB) and armor class (CMD). Where grappling checks could slow a 3.x game to a standstill, Pathfinder makes them nearly as simple as regular attack rolls. Dungeon Masters like me who got frustrated because of the complexity of high-level battles in 3.x, will find much relief in the Pathfinder system.<br /><br />Overall:<br />It's not that Pathfinder is bad. Pathfinder does include some really nice fixes to the system, such as classes getting something new at every level and slightly more balanced play at low levels. If you like D&D 3.x, Pathfinder is a better version of that game. If you disliked 3.x, you will probably not like Pathfinder.ombat a much faster affair, in terms of setting up a battle and moving turn-to-turn.

B0006Z2LH4|1.0|I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />The film's concept was well-conceived but poorly executed. The acting was beyond horrible, sometimes even unbearable. When the talent faltered in the original Cube, the simplicity and dimension of the film made up for it. That's not the case with this one. Cube 2 was no monumental classic either, however, it was at least mildly entertaining and pleasant to look at even if it does hold so little weight it's not worth remembering.<br /><br />If you like typical Sci-Fi Channel (or SyFy as it now calls itself) fare, complete with cheesiness, overdone special effects, predictibility, actors practically being fed their lines, and an overall feeling that you've just been robbed when you're done watching the film, you will LOVE Cube Zero.
0786956291|1.0|Let's start with the elephant in the room- the original red box was issued in 1983, and is highly prized as a collector's item. The old red box was a standard of the \\"Original D&D\\" (OD&D) era, so when I saw a red box sitting in the D&D section, I almost ran across the comic shop I was in to pick it up. I was checking my pocket for my credit card, thinking here's my chance to own a high-quality red box and I'm taking it. I pick up the product and...<br /><br />Wait, what is this anyway? This is just a 4th edition starter set, packaged in a red box to trick gamers like me who would feel an immediate flair of nostalgia. Any long-time D&D gamers knows about \\"the red box\\", and finding out that Wizards is using that nostalgia to this end feels a little insulting.<br /><br />Finding out what's actually in the box doesn't help, either. Wizards has a problem with trying to force players into purchasing multiple products in order to obtain a \\"complete\\" game, and this product is no exception. The rules of 4th edition, already drastically simplified themselves, are further boiled down in this box. This is a very dumbed-down game, and if you plan on moving up to 4th edition proper after playing this, you'll find that you basically have to throw this box away and start from scratch. The quality of the dice is so-so, the markers for the players and monsters aren't near the quality of the prepainted figurines that you'll see advertised in the main books. There's basically nothing here of lasting quality.<br /><br />So on the whole, if you're going to play 4th edition D&D, there is no need to own this product. 4th edition's rules are so simplified, that even absolute beginners can dive right in to the full game. Plus, you'll save money in the long run going straight to the books. Personally though, I wouldn't recommend that anyone play 4th edition, even the proper game. You can read my reviews on the other 4e products for more, but personally I do not feel that 4th edition is the best edition of D&D.<br /><br />So what would I recommend? If you can find other players who are interested in the game, and if you want to stick to D&D proper, I'd go for D&D 3.5. It's fairly easy to get in to, and a lot more fun than 4e in the long run.<br /><br />Better yet, I'd actually advise you to skip the D&D line completely and pick up Pathfinder. Pathfinder is basically a D&D version 3.75, made by people who were dissatisfied with aspects of all editions of D&D and who decided to create a better system by taking the core of D&D 3.5 and improving on it. At the time of writing, Pathfinder is the best and most complete version of D&D that you can purchase off the shelves. The Pathfinder Core Rulebook is currently quite a bit more expensive than this boxed set, but it's a full game that you can play over and over. That Pathfinder book is also a little more expensive than the basic 4e Player's Handbook, but it's well-known that the 4e Player's Handbook has some key elements hacked out so you really have to purchse the PHBII to complete the product. Overall, Pathfinder may actually be the cheapest way to get properly introduced to D&D. Save money in the long run, and enjoy a superior product as you do so- try Pathfinder. There's even a free beta-edition PDF of the Pathfinder rulebook available online, for anyone to try.what would I recommend?

B001TODCII|5.0|I love the way the dad takes every measure to bring his daughter back, this has good acting and good a good script and it is exciting all the way through the movie as he battles exploitative sociopaths and human smugglers in search of his daughter.     It is good there is a movie about human smuggling since it is on the rise, its a very important thing that is going on and should definately be addressed
088708155X|3.0|Just a heads up that this is the tiniest hardcover book I have ever seen!  It is less than 6 inches tall!  I had purchased it to read to a group of children, but there is no way they will be able to see the illustrations.  The specifications are in the description so it is not false advertising, but I do think that the size being pointed out would be helpful to customers.  I never would have imagined it would be so small and was shocked when I saw the box on my doorstep today.  It is a cute book though so I will keep it to read to my son, but will need something else to read to the class.

B003ZHVJFK|5.0|When a movie based on a video game is announced, the thoughts \\"oh no, not another one\\" or \\"that killed it...\\" come to most peoples' mind. However, some actually turn out decent. Like Tekken. I think it turned out great. A lot of action, great characters, and an okay plot(could have been a little better). You don't really have to be a fan of Tekken to enjoy the movie. It's all a matter of opinions. I personally think that some movies based of video games are really good. Sure some can have bad acting, be really short or not have actors that really look like the ones in the video game, but not all of them are bad(as i have said). I'd recommend Tekken to any Tekken fans, and people who aren't fans.

Demographics [and proximity] is [nearly] destiny;  3. The apple never [rarely] falls very far from the tree [in so many sociological examples];  4. You [just about] can't escape the [your] past.    If you are looking for a book that shows these sentences remain true as ever, Outliers is, then, your book.
B004BJ7RA2|1.0|I just finished reading \\"Just Kids\\" and I'm missing Robert and Patti already.    The book has some drawbacks - page after page of seeming name dropping and apparently some events and/or circumstances that diligent researchers have said just couldn't have happened that way or at that time .... but overall it's a mesmerizing book for many reasons.    There is the nostalgia element - Max's Kansas City when it really was something special, the Chelsea, not quite in its heyday but with enough icons still checking in and out (literally and figuratively), as well as an overall gentler, kinder and more forgiving NYC.    Then there are two people of whom I knew so little about and each of whom I had carelessly pigeon-holed and filed away somewhere outside of things \\"that matter.\\"    Patti Smith, a grunge rocker who never appealed to me and whose music I did not know (and which I assumed I would not like).    Her love, compassion and admiration for Robert is unmistakable in a book where he almost outshines the author, where she bring him more to life than herself.  Hard to know if that was the plan or if it was just something she couldn't avoid doing.  Raising Robert up as an offering the world didn't even know it wanted, or needed.    Robert Mapplethorpe - a pornographic, blasphemous, self-centered \\"artist.\\"  In my mind, he did not eveen really qualify as an artist (I confess, I am not one anyone should discuss art with - I'm still confused as to why Jackson Pollack is considered an artist)....    And am I now ready to defend and claim a great understanding and admiration of his work?  Some, yes.  I've been googling like mad since I finished the book, looking at his work, at the portraits he did for Patti's album covers.  Some, I like and find compelling.  Others ... we'll, we're back to my artistically uneducated question of \\"Why and how is that art?\\"    But I digress ...    More than my simply not considering either Patti or Robert artists, neither was ever in my consiousness long enough for me to even consider them people ... they were controversial individuals to occasionally be read about in both pro and con articles and then forgotten.    I had a slight awareness at some point in my life that Patti co-wrote a song with Bruuuuuuce and that fact did get my musical attention for a while, but then it was only The Boss who I stuck with.    After reading this book, they are so very real to me.  I see them now through the lens of my young adulthood, my \\"just kids\\" phase and I regret so much that I did not have the kind of inner driving forces each had, regardless of the dark sides of many of those forces).    And the dedication.  The  passion!  That's what really gets to me.  The dedication they had for each other and for their drive to find their way.  The passion they had for living, loving, exploring, growing, learning, creating and just being.  It's the passion I envy the most and what will keep these two young, brightly burning (and in one case burning out too soon) individuals in my heart and mind so vividly.    How dare we criticize individuals so dedicated to each other, to themselves, to their dreams, to their visions and to the  moment?  They lived a more fully realized life in one day than most do in a lifetime.    It's hard to believe, but I was living in NYC at the same time they were.  How could I have not have known that, not have felt that, not have been called or driven to that?  What I wouldn't give to have been drawn into their world.  Like a moth to a flame. I would have circled and circled, yearning to really be \\"in\\" their world, but regrettably satisfied to at least be a hanger on, a vicarious voyeur..    The closest our paths may have crossed is that Patti recalls an apartment she had just a block away from the Kettle of Fish, the bar where I smoked my first joint.  Could it be possible that she was in the next stall in the ladies' room where I sat for quite a while wondering if I was high yet?  Or could I have brushed by Robert as he stood at the bar, digging through his pockets to determine if both he and Patti could have a beer or if one would have to do for both of them.      I see no reason why I can't consider each of those scenarios a distinct possibility, and through enough wishful thinking turn them into reality over the coming years as I tell tales of my past.  Let the diligent researchers try to disprove it ... in a few years I'll even be able to tell you exactly what Robert was wearing and what song Patti was humming in the stall next to mine.    I will lift my next glass of wine to the children who found each other in a long-ago, fairy-tale, no-longer-existing NYC, who loved each other in ways most of us will never love, and who kept the dream burning for themselves and for each other.  Sometimes without understanding, but always supporting.    Here's to you, you two \\"just kids.\\"  You did good.

I'm always (extremely moved) by his compassion and passion.  Song's like, \\"Morphine\\" and \\"Is It Scary?,\\" were so intense.....\\"I felt every word\\" and found myself,(in tears). There is a great deal of \\"autobiographical story telling,\\" in his lyrics.  I could truly feel Michael's pain, angst and frustration with \\"those\\" who tried to \\"unjustly\\" hurt him, and \\"wrongfully attack\\" his integrity. Michael is such (a lovely soul), a man of \\"true integrity  and honor, always!\\"  His amazing songwriting ability and lyrics are so inspiring!
1416550550|5.0|If you used to like fairy tales as a kid and adventure stories with mysterious plots and female heroines and you do not mind but even like reading a really lengthy one for adults that plays between Australia and Cornwall, England and stretches over several generations with stories inside the story and a somewhat happy ending this one is for You! I really enjoyed reading it even though I was not too impressed by \\"The House at Riverton\\" which is also by Kate Morton and as a result I was critical approaching \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" but I am glad I did and I did not really wanted it to end! I found it beautiful and enchanting and a very satisfying read! I liked most of the main female characters and also the garden and house descriptions as well as the artistic themes and the short fairy tales. Made me want to travel back to Cornwall which I visited years ago and I liked it then.

0393330435|1.0|I have always been fascinated by the Woz. I am just a few years younger and an electrical and firmware engineer and usually find books about colleagues interesting. Unfortunately, this book is very painful to read. Steve, as sharp a guy as he is, is a horrific writer. This book is written at a 3rd. grade level and is composed of the worst mix of terrible grammar and poor English. After a few chapters, you cannot help but feel that the books was written by a bumbling idiot-savant. But regardless, the Woz is a curious and interesting person and did have a large part in the computer revolution. I was just toying with Trash-80's shortly after he and Jobs did the garage gig. Funny, I always liked the Radio Shack computers more than anything Apple had at the time.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|to D. Vaughn, a reviewer below : What planet have you been living on?? your comment: \\"its about time they made a movie in Pennsylvania\\". Brother, they're making ALL kinds of movies in the Pittsburgh area. More movies being made in Pa right now than anywhere besides NY and California. \\"unstoppable\\", \\"next three days\\" and \\"love and other drugs\\" are all Pittsburgh PA made movies that were in the theater at th exact same time late last year. The economy is just fine there (much better than it is in CA)  Anyways....this has some great scenery and keeps you glued to the screen. Has good replay value too. I thought going in that this may be a \\"cliche\\" type movie that i would hate, but actually i really liked it. Just ordered the Blu-Ray.
B003YUC2FE|4.0|This is just a quick review but I had to say that although the image quality of the movies is great (Toy Story 3 looks fantastic) the packaging, frankly, left a lot to be desired. It's a good idea - to have it literally as a toy box - however it was badly designed for the following reasons:    1) The lid of the \\"box\\" is kinda flimsy. My 4 year old loves the Toy Story movies and he wants to pick up the box and look at it, but I feel like a bad daddy because I'm afraid he'll break that lid. It's just card and the whole thing hangs together like a cheaply produced paperback.    2) There's no insert to describe what's on each disc. Big omission, imho    3) All the discs stand vertically in foam padding that has been specifically designed to allow the discs to slot in and out. Major problem here - you can't get the discs out easily and it's impossible without putting your fingers on the non-printed side of the disc (ie, the side that actually gets read by the player). I can see some playback issues here... some slim cases, slotted into the toy box, would have worked much better... but I guess it's cheaper this way.    4) The codes for the digital copies are in an envelope... stuck to the inside of the box. I can't type what I thought when I saw this because then my review would be rejected. What idiot thought that would be a good idea? You either have to rip the envelope out or very very carefully try to gingerly remove the inserts from the envelope if you don't want to rip anything.    So... five stars for the movies, three stars for the packaging, averaging out at four stars in all. Pixar is amazing - it's a pity the marketing idiots at Disney are not.
0151003084|5.0|This story is a modern day version of a classic Victorian Cautionary tale. While today it is not a story that is typically purchased for a child, unless by a literary relative who wants to expand the soft, overly supportive environment of the modern child, the book is written in the exact style and illustration of the classic types. Cautionary tales of the Victorian Era were stories that did not have the happy endings of today's stories and instead served as tools for parents to teach the more difficult, tedious tasks of growing up. Typically these stories taught morals, manners and behavior by showing what happens to small children when they did not follow protocol. These outcomes were never pretty, and even when illustrated they showed the pretty little girls with their bows meeting unhappy fates, which were designed to reinforce the deterring nature of the story. The Gashlycrumb Tinies takes this style and puts it into the ever-popular format of the alphabet books. The basic premise is one that is easily understood by young children, and by using children as the subjects of the bad behaviors, personalizes the outcomes of bad decisions. Any one example in this book shows how the simple language is fully supported and explained by the illustration. \\"K is for Kate who was struck with an axe.\\" (K) While the writing is simple and to some may seem pointlessly creepy, the illustration accompanying tells the story: clearly Kate was out alone on a dark evening when she was supposed to be home, and something bad happened to her as a result of her misbehaving.

Calories in/calories out isn't valid. I get it. I got it the first of the 100 times you said it and countless chapters you devoted to proving the theory by using detailed examples of ancient peoples or whatever. I understand insulin resistance. I got that the first time you went through the chemisty in excruciating detail. I'm hoping I didn't wear out the 'Next Page' on my Kindle by using it at such a frenetic pace. One chapter devoted to each of these hypotheses would have been sufficient. You don't need to cite every study ever done nor quote anyone who's ever agreed with your theory. Can you make a statement without beginning it with 'According to ABC of XYZ?'  I believe you !!!    I had a glimmer of hope when I got to Chapter 13 and thought you might now be speaking my language and that I might actually get some valid information that I could use in my daily life. Nope. I'm now beginning Chapter 16 and wondering if I've already gleaned all I can from this extremely detailed, way too long explanation of Why We Get Fat and What to Do About It.     Again, I agree with everything in the book (I've agreed ever since I read my first of many books on this subject). I just don't need the information to be repeated over and over and over ad nauseum.  Just make the point, don't bury it in complicated detail and move on.

B002BU0DPE|3.0|I love these headphones, I use them every day.<br /><br />The best part is the bass, it is amazing.  I can hear bleeps and bloops I never knew were there.  Its great for shooters or anything where directional audio helps.  The richness of the sound is very satisfying.<br /><br />The only drawback is they have an audio hiss.  Its overpowered by any sound or audio, but during the quiet moments or before you start playing, you can definitely hear it.  The Mic isn't noise canceling, but is directional and quite nice.<br /><br />I've used on my PC, Xbox, and PS3.  Would recommend to anyone.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />It has been about a year and a half, and I have had a few issues.  Twice now the wires inside the cords have broken and needed to be repaired.  Both times it was in an area near a joint, and both required disassembly and re-soldering.

055299703X|4.0|I had read this book about 7 years ago (lent by a friend) but having just completed a 3 week tour of Australia, I had to read it again.    Bryson really captures the spirit of Australia and the Australian people. Very understated but extremely proud of their country.    A case study of the difference between the USA and the Aussies was something that I read in the paper while there.  A small commuter-type plane had crashed landed because the pilot (no co-pilot) had forgotten to lower the landing gear.  On the plane was an Aussie state head (like a governor in the states).  Fortunately no one was injured but there was serious damage to the plane and embarassment for the pilot and the story line was how badly everyone felt for the pilot who was described as a very good pilot but somehow missed the flashing warning lights that the gear was still up. The story further went on to say that there would be no punishment but \\"maybe\\" he would be asked to go to some remedial pilot training.  Imagine!    Bryson's book is replete with these kinds of stories. The fascinating people he met, the unique history of Australia, and the flora and fauna of this country/continent.    While he is hilarious and hales from Des Moines, one must get used to his time in London as he likes to use British spellings and terms like \\"kerb\\" for curb and adding a lot of extra \\"u's\\"  (e.g. labour, for example) in his words.    This is especially useful book to read if you are thinking of visiting the land down under.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|I received an early copy of this CD 4 days ago and I haven't stopped playing it.  The melodies, sounds and rhythms layered through out each piece bring you in and transport you on a musical journey.  I have my favorites Nine, Vertigo, Truth of Touch and Flash of  Color but I have to say I love them all.  I think this will appeal to a wide range of musical tastes...not just Yanni fans.  So crank up the volume and escape into the music....it just makes you feel good!
0061864153|5.0|Enjoyed every aspect of this book.  Waited with anticipation for it to get to me, and when it did, it surpassed my expectations.  Thoroughly enjoyed it !!!
1407115561|5.0|My toddler loves this book and so do I. It's wonderful for so many reasons: The colorful, beautiful illustrations, the original and engaging story line and an inspiring but subtle message about breaking out of traditional gender roles (the princess wants to be a doctor, not prance around in a frilly dress). It's also written in rhyming verse, so it's fun to read aloud and pleasing to listen to.
1416583432|1.0|I'm very interested in what makes dogs tick, but this book really offered no enlightenment at all. It was an odd mixture of silly, personal anecdotes about the author's own dog, and many lofty and scientific pontifications about an odd assortment of human and animal behavior. The organization was poor, the content rambles, and there is no index, so you can't really use it as a reference tool. This is simply not a very informative book. It's more a brain dump of stuff the author knows something about thrown together quickly to make money off of us dog lovers. I suspect the author has contacts and thus the good and misleading reviews from people who probably didn't read it. Just a guess on my part, but it's hard for me to understand the glowing reviews in any other way. The great thing about this book is the photo of the dog on the cover.

B001ECDVKE|5.0|Yes this is a wild movie.  It is loosely based on the Topps company early 1960's creation \\"Attack from Space\\". Which was later renamed \\"Mars Attack\\".  The Movie was humerous, The cards were heidious. None of the actions in the movie showed the extent of the devastation brought to earth by the Martians.  Giant bugs feeding on people, Live people and dead bodies being scooped up with a bulldoser and crushed into brick walls, innocent people being frozen alive, childrens pets being destroyed before their eyes.  The people of earth reduced to living in caves.    No this is not a gory or sadistic movie as some have accerted but a watered down version of the original horror story, which ended when earth launched a brutal assault on the planet Mars that ended in the destruction of the planet itself.    If you have a problem with Tim Burtons version of \\"Mars Attacks\\", maybe you should avoid all movie titles that include the word \\"attack\\".    This movie was made as a funny adaptation of Topps trading card series and anyone who puts more into it than that is seriously over analyzing it.
B0041T52S6|5.0|If this film were stashed away & brought out of mothballs a hundred years from now, it'd still be a cool movie! Michael Cera--sort of the poster boy for the \\"now\\" generation--plays the somewhat clueless & rather beleaguered title character in this often entertaining & mind-blowing fusion between hip romantic comedies & the world of video games. The logistics of the dazzling CGI alone must've been a nightmare for the filmmakers. But the payback is well worth it as our hero--in order to date the girl of his dreams--must defeat her \\"seven deadly exes\\" amidst visual \\"POWS\\" & \\"WHAMS\\" & comic book panel split screens which underscore all the action. Scott Pilgrim is a foolish but likable slacker who expects sympathy over his often broken heart, yet, doesn't seem to notice the hearts HE breaks! And that is the ongoing lesson which Pilgrim--as he racks up points (shown on the screen)--must realize as his \\"ultimate goal\\".   There's so much going on in this film that trying to dissect it would be like writing a book, so I won't even bother. Suffice to say that its creative energy is so awesome that even when segments don't make much sense, it doesn't matter because the movie's quirky, irresistible energy sweeps the viewer right along for the ride. Cera is lucky that's he supported by a large cast of well-known names (Kieran Culkin, Chris Evans, Brandon Routh, Jason Schwartzman, etc.) as well as little-knowns. They all play their roles expertly to the hilt.   We definitely need more fun, innovative, cutting-edge films like this one!
0553584537|4.0|This book is the first in Lisa Gardner's Detective D. D. Warren Series, as well as the first book I've read by this author.  When I saw this for only $.99 on my NookColor I didn't hesitate to buy it and give it a read. I did a little read up on Lisa Gardner and found it very interesting that she actually sold her first book during her junior year in college.  It was a romance sold to Silhouette Intimate Moments.  She then went on to publish 13 romance novels before she took on a suspense novel.<br /><br />I have never read any of Ms. Gardner's romance novels, but I think she does an excellent job in the suspense genre.  Alone was off and running from the first chapter.  The author does a really great job of keeping the story tight and controlled to the storyline. There are not a bunch of unnecessary characters.  Interestingly enough, Detective D.D. Warren doesn't have a huge role in this story so it is hard to tell what I think of that character.  I guess I'm going to have to read the next book in the series to see what I think of that character

B00304LF0W|2.0|I don't know what everyone in the trailer \\"audience\\" is screaming about. It didn't even make me flinch, and I have PTSD. On a good day I'm extrememly jumpy. If you don't go into it expecting to feel anything that remotely resembles fear you'll be fine. People who like this movie can go on and on about imagination and their theories about others not using it, but whatever. It's just not going to do it for some of us and that's okay...you're not retarded if it doesn't.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|This was the classic that started it all! The Karate Kid(1984) entertained a broad audience and made learning Karate trendy!<br />Movies such as Sidekicks(1993) and Never Back Down(2008) have tried to emulate it. It was followed by The Karate Kid Part II(1986), The Karate Kid Part III(1989) and the semi-sequel The Next Karate Kid(1994). Sadly, it was also followed by the cheesy The Karate Kid: The Animated Series(1989) with Daniel LaRusso and Mr. Miyagi battling supernatural baddies! Daniel LaRusso(Ralph Macchio) is bullied by rich, spoiled teenage boys in California who have a mean, unethical Karate teacher! Mr. Miyagi(Pat Morita) becomes friends with Daniel and teaches him real Karate. Daniel is also befriended by a lovely blonde girl(Elisabeth Shue).<br /> Most of the martial arts movies that come out of Hollywood are not good. Some of the best martial arts movies come from places such as Japan, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Thailand. The Karate Kid movies, so far, are the best martial arts movies to come from Hollywood filmmakers. Ralph Macchio was a household name at the time. In The Parent Trap II(1986), a redheaded girl comments that she \\"saw a cute guy who looked like Ralph Macchio\\". The late Noriyuki \\"Pat\\" Morita, a comic actor, gives a sincere performance as Mr. Miyagi. At one point, Toshiro Mifune and Mako were almost cast as Mr. Miyagi.<br />Elisabeth Shue is lovely, talented, and underrated. Adventures in Babysitting(1987) is one of my favorite comedies.<br />Bill Conti's music score for The Karate Kid is a classic, as well. The Karate Kid was remade in 2010 starring Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan.
B003EYVXTG|2.0|This movie was recommended by a friend of mine.  She told me, not long after watching this movie that I needed to see it so she could have my take on it.  I must confess it took me a while to finally see it.  Notwithstanding, I finally rented the movie and this is review is an ode to her...<br /><br />The plot of this film is rather simple, yet compelling, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 17 year old girl who lives with her younger brother and sister and her catatonic mother.  Her father is supposed to be at trial in a week and since he has bonded the home for his release from jail, it is imperative he appears.  In contrast, Jessup (the father) hasn't been seen in quite some time.  So now it is up to Ree to find her father in order to save her family's home.  Under the assumption that this scenario isn't interesting enough, Jessup is known for being a \\"cooker\\" which is a code word for an alchemist in making methamphetamines.<br /><br />This leads Ree on a rather interesting odyssey through the rural, poverty stricken Ozarks.  During this misadventure \\"we the viewers\\" meet many characters along the way.  Ree is able to form a bittersweet bond with her estranged uncle, her father's brother, who goes by the name Teardrop.  This title is manly due to the fact he has a tattoo under his eye.  I am going to end plot description and details here, for a person who wants to know more, stop reading my review and watch the movie.<br /><br />I believe I missed the boat on this motion picture.  I found it to be almost painful to watch. The film was unbelievably slow, watching Ree walk around and keeps asking people where her father was became very old, very fast.  The first forty minutes or so that is all that happened.  The characters were flat and numb.  I realize that is the filmmakers' intention to exploit, in a manner of speaking, the culture of people living in this part of America.  The methamphetamine angle was really nothing more than a red herring, which is too bad because this area would have been a nice place to explore.<br /><br />\\"Winter's Bone\\" is labeled and promoted as \\"thriller\\".  I would go out on a limb and depict it as an edgy drama at best; there isn't anything thrilling about this movie.  I don't need non-stop action, most of the films I like need time to brew, and this film left me with a flat feeling.  In contrast, I need to give credit to the acting.  Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job.  She is nominated for an Oscar, as is John Hawkes who plays Teardrop.  This leaves me feeling a bit ambivalent, while I didn't really care about any of the characters in the movie; I felt the performances were gritty and realistic. Another positive was some of the principal photography, establishing shots and landscapes of the Ozarks were captured with a haunting beauty.<br /><br />Despite of nice cinematography and good acting, I found this movie to be a let down.  The pace was too languid, the sequences of events was also very tedious, which left me hoping the movie would just end. I reached a point where I honestly didn't care if the story was resolved.  Nevertheless, my opinion appears to be in the minority since this movie has been nominated for an Academy Award and has received a great deal of critical praise.  I am scratching my head, but this is coming from the same guy who is still bemused that Judi Dench won an Oscar for an \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" when she was only on the screen for five minutes.een a nice place to explore.    \\"Winter's Bone\\" is labeled and promoted as \\"thriller\\".

0320070573|3.0|I have the English version of this lovely book, and being a Francophile, I just had to have the French version.  Being unsuccessful in getting it from France, I was ecstatic to finally purchase it through a US company (sans the hefty shipping charge).  There is a wrinkle in the front cover of this hardcover book - a manufacturing defect. Because of its fragility it gets beat up in shipping, even though it is wrapped in it's original plastic.  I guess I'm so picky because I consider it a collector's piece (although this French version is not marked Premier Edition). Overall, this would be a wonderful gift for the Francophile in your life.
1439153663|3.0|The Kathleen Grissom's The Kitchen House breaks your heart from the first page (and every page thereafter).  It's a surprisingly rough read. The novel centers on a seven year old Irish girl, Lavinia, who is coming with her parents to America in the time of Southern Plantations and slavery.  Her parents die on the crossing.  Lavinia is then swiftly separated from her brother the only family she has left.  Lavinia is now a slave forced to work off her debt.  And so she is given to Belle, a half black kitchen slave who is the master's illegitimate daughter. She is implanted with a black family and then is subjected to or witnesses almost every tragedy known to Literature. Although I wasn't expecting a sunshine depiction of slavery, I also wasn't prepared for such an unrelenting onslaught of misery and pain.  For example during the first few chapters; after being orphaned and enslaved--Lavinia witnesses a baby die, the rape of slaves is alluded to, pedophilia is alluded to, a little girl is killed, and a man is almost lynched but instead is only severely beaten and loses an ear.  It doesn't get better.  Instead hate, secrets and misinformation jeopardize all the characters again and again.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the unabated torture of such endearing characters, I probably would have loved this novel.  The story is told in alternating chapters from the perspective of Lavinia and Belle.  All the characters are vibrantly drawn and markedly developed.  The setting feels real.  The affect that Lavinia and Belle feel like people you know and the fictional plantation of Tall Oaks like somewhere you've been.  The story arcs are also deftly constructed, complex and tied together cleanly.  The premise, though not entirely probable, does allow the author to approach the well traversed material in a new way.<br /> So if you're looking for a dark and atmospheric historical novel, The Kitchen House is as good as any I've read. AndiIf you can, choose the audio version.  Both Orlagh Cassidy as Lavinia and Bahni Turpin as Belle bring the novel to life.dy as Lavinia and Bahni Turpin as Belle bring the novel to life.

0783219695|5.0|If you were alive during the Apollo 13 flight, this film will fill in all of the blanks the news media was not allowed to pass along to us.  It is exceedingly well done.  The casting could not have been better.  Of course, anything with Ed Harris, Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, and Kevin Bacon must be well above average.  For those of you who were not alive in the 1960's, you will want to watch this to improve your cultural awareness of major historical events in America.  Not everyone was on drugs, thank goodness.  You might also enjoy \\"Space Cowboys\\" (another all-star cast: Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, and James Garner-still Hunks after all these years.)
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|Please do not show this to children (or mentally healthy adults). It is not a moral guide for children to pattern themselves after, which is the purpose of this genre. It is the opposite. It depicts the hero as a morally confused individual unworthy of children's aspirations and it corrupts or kills the two other lead characters.     It represents standing up for what is right against evil, as useless and even harmful. It promotes the sort of moral confusion and cowardice that allows psychopathic monsters like Hitler, Lenin & Stalin to take power and murder millions of people. They are a focus for a coalition of sociopaths who want to rule and terrorize everyone else into submission. They can gain power ONLY when most people are too morally confused by their propaganda and/or too cowardly to take a stand against them. They have no power unless people give it to them. We need to evolve past this or continue to suffer atrocities on large scales. This movie promotes the wrong response and leaves us vulnerable to allowing monsters to take power.    Destroying children's heroes, and their models for who they decide they would like to emulate, should never be allowed. If the makers of this movie wanted to deal with dark and morally negative stories they do not need to degrade and destroy well known and well loved children's heroes to do so. This movie was reprehensible.
0061245097|5.0|I really like this author. Jeaniene Frost is expressive, fun. light, and her books are a delight to read.  This charater is young, smart and sexy. But thankfully not a high schooler. The book has a different twist in the character which is fun. This is book 2 out of four and I am hoping for more! I really don't want the series to end.
B00280LYIC|3.0|I only wish I knew the writing level when I purchased this book. The plot is fantastic, yet I was unaware that it was written so simplistically. There was so much room for symbolism and deep meaning, yet it seemed to be cut short due to its level. A deep understanding of greek mythology helped enhance the experience, yet it was not enough to overcome the writing style. I would definitely buy another copy that was written more for adults.
1401310400|5.0|Happy to have the book and looking forward to reading it as soon as my classes are done.  Recieved the book in great time and in great condition.  Will order from this seller again.

I'll not recommend this to somebody with little to no PJ experience, you might want to get the rearviewmirror compilation (studio recorded, not live) or if you want to listen to this guys live go and get any other of their bootleg performances, specially the 08 tour since they were not singing lots of songs of the new albums you will find a more balanced set list from the new and the old PJ.

B0040JHNZ2|5.0|From a french perspective, the novel was great! I got bored with world without end but this one is as good as the pillars of the earth. The historical details and fictional melt to give a very interesting perspective on the inner conflicts of the true characters. Thanks to Follet, we see Churchill, Wilson and others as men, with their own conflicts of interest, knowledge and background and how all these factors can interfere with their positions and beliefs. We can understand how nowadays, leaders can be driven to conflict without even knowing it, with the recent developments in Tunis and Egypt, who could have predicted such a fall for the giants that were leading these countries...
1594202842|1.0|I don't know why people assume negative reviews this book gets are from people only reading the excerpt.  I have finished the book in a Powell bookstore today.  Cause I don't want to support the author by buying her book.  There is noting surprised me in the book.  It played out just like the excerpt on WSJ.  For your reference, the author claimed this is not a parenting \\"how to\\" guide, but this book is categorized in the \\"Parenting/child care\\" section of Powell bookstore!    No matter what message the author wants her reader to get from her book, the message I get after finishing the book is \\"A story of an emotionally (may be physically as well) abused daughter tried to escape from her control freak mother in a very confined household with no body to turn to.   Her father and her older sister turned a deaf ear on her.  She finally succeeded when she grew old enough and realize if she cry out in public, she will get enough attention and her abusive mother has no choice but to give in.\\"  The scary part is that it is not written by the abused but the abuser.  For me, the author is self-absurd to the point that she put out such a book to come clean so in the end she can still be seen as a great mother.  Base on so many 5 star reviews this book gets, the author reached her goal.     The mentality of the author is clearly very dictatorial.  She has to be the absolute authority to her daughters.  They have to do what they are told otherwise they will anger their mother.  They endured such treatment as hrs and hrs of piano and violin practice sections under her supervision for years since they were very young in which cases the older daughter left teeth marks on the piano and the younger daughters, in one instance, get no water, food and bathroom break. The tipping point came when the author ask her younger daughter to eat an egg in a restaurant in Russia, she claimed everyone went to Russia has to try the egg if I remember correctly, and her daughter refused.  Her daughter protesting her mother to leave her alone by declaring she would smash a glass.  The author then dared her daughter to smash it, which her daughter did.    In the whole book the author demonstrated a very competitive personality.  Everything was a competition to her, including being a parent.  She had to out parent the \\"westerners\\" as a \\"Chinese mother\\".  She was even competing with her own daughters as she herself put it , the \\"psychological torture\\" rounds she and her 2nd daughter threw at each other.  Of cause her  daughter was not her match when young.  But as soon as she got older, she had enough mental power to refuse complying to her mothers control, the showdown began.      I can go on and on since I have more to say about this book.  You ought to read the book yourself to see how much more metal abuse her daughter endured through out their short lives since they are only teenagers by now.     Oh, one last thing before I go, there is nothing to do about \\"Chinese\\".  She is only using it as an excuse.  Maybe more mother in China behave her way cause they are in a socialist dictatorship environment and they don't know better.  But for the author, I don't think she can use this ploy cause she is an American and a \\"Yale law professor\\".      Added by reviewer:    I forgot one thing. In the book the author mentioned that 2nd generation female often marries white. I wonder why is that.  What gave them the impression that white men are more appealing as husband.  Especially for the author. If she praise the Chinese parenting style so highly when she had her daughters and decided to apply it on her daughters, why she prefer a Jewish man over Chinese?    I think I found an answer to the Author's question \\"why Chinese mother can get away from doing and saying those things to they children\\".  Because they don't care about HUMAN RIGHTS and that's when they are in China. The question now i want to ask is \\"If American should let these kind of mothers get away from parenting this way in American even if they are \\"IVY LEAGUE MATERIAL AND THEIR CHILDREN GO TO IVY LEAGUE\\".      Sorry I came back to add my thoughts again and again makes this review very long.  I am just amused that the author has so many fans.  I can only come to a conclusion that her fans are either westerners misled by her or controlling parents as insensitive as her.   There is a difference between \\"tough love strict parent\\" and \\"control freak mental abuser\\".  People need to know their is a line between \\"tough love strict parent\\" and \\"control freak mental abuser\\". For me, the author crossed the line. As an 1st generation Immigrant mother from Taiwan, the author tried to preach her mental abuse parenting style by stereotyping \\"Chinese mother\\" horrifies and sickens me.  I don't see much of a reflection of the author by the end of the book.  Personally, I have doubt that the conversation between her and her daughters in the last chapter did take place but only in her fantasy.      I don't see her publishing such a book as courage and honest but ignorant and arrogant.    Please don't think all the Chinese students you encounters have these crazy \\"Chinese tiger mothers\\" as the author tried to stereotype. Please give our Chinese students more credit that they know to behave respectfully because their parents are respectful to them and we are respectful ourselves. The author is not respectful even to her own ethnicity for labeling her narcissistic ego driven parenting as \\"Chinese\\". May be more Chinese mothers are \\"tiger mothers\\" but in my eyes it's wrong and the cycle need to break. And many \\"tiger parents\\" had very tragic childhood, survived cultural revolution in China, separated when young from their parents to escape Communist Chines, etc. So their behavior is somewhat understandable. But this author grew up in American, how tragic can her childhood be to explain her irrational behavior but her own personal defect. This happen in all ethnicity. It's wrong to preach and stereotype this kind of parenting style as most us responsible parents (western or Chinese) try to find a balance in parenting.    It's sad that she used \\"Chinese\\". She is not Chinese she is American. She should have used something not so specific. I have no choice to be seen as a \\"Chinese mother\\", but I don't want to be categorized with her and by her as a \\"tiger mother\\".
B003Q6D25K|3.0|After coming home and seeing thier house vandalized the Rey family installs security cameras to catch burglars.  The cameras pick up much more then that.  If you have seen the first one you will know what to expect as far as the camera work and basic feel.  I did not realize going in that this was a prequel, in a way.  If you have seen the first one you will understand more of the aspects of the movie.  It's not really an easy movie to review.  The original scared the crap out of me, and I was tense all through this one too, not because it was really scary on its own, but more of a hangover from the first one.  The original was a better movie overall and this one felt forced, but it is still very much worth watching if you liked the first one.  It didn't scare me nearly as much as the first one, but I really liked the way they tied the two movies together.  Not really sure they need a 3rd one, but they are making one anyway.  I guess horror directors and studios just dont know when to stop.  I give it a B-.<br /><br />Would I watch it again? - I think I would, after re-watching the first one to see stuff I may have missed

B0041KKYCY|3.0|After being brutaly treated, Jennifer (Butler) snaps and begins her quest for revenge.  Writer Jennifer Hills finds a secluded cabin in which to start her new novel.  A group of local lowlifes break in and begin a shockingly brutal torture and rape on her, thinking she is dead they think its over.  She then hunts them down one by one and exacts her own terror upon them.  All I've heard about this movie was how shocking and graphic it is.  The original was banned in many countries.  After watching it I have to say it wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting.  The rape scene was no worse then the one in \\"Last House On The Left\\", it just went on a little longer (the one in \\"Girl With The Dragon Tatoo was worse) and the rest of the killings were actually not as bad as in the \\"Saw\\" movies.  It may be that with all of the \\"Saw\\" and \\"Hostel\\" and other \\"let's see how many people we can cut up in two hour\\" movies I am becoming used to it, but this was not as bad as I expected.  And like most movies with a rape victim you feel no pity for the rapists fates. I give it a C.<br /><br />Would I watch again? Nope

0374290024|4.0|This is a Big Book about a Big Idea. An archaeologist by trade, Morris takes the reader on an epic, lively jaunt through all of human history (and I do mean \\"all\\") in an attempt to answer the question:    Why does the West rule? Why did tiny England conquer a quarter of the world, instead of, say, China putting Victoria to the sword instead?    I don't think he answers it very well, and the predictions he makes about the near future based on his conclusions regarding the past are even less justified, yet... I _did_ enjoy the heck out of this book.    The majority of \\"Why the West Rules\\" is taken up with an excellent retelling of how humanity developed in what he considers the two \\"cores\\"; roughly Europe/Middle East vs. China/Japan/SE Asia. His quest for answers takes him all the way back to BEFORE humanity, to discuss how climate changes during the various Ice Ages affected humanity's predecessors and gene pools in the two core areas might have played in role in those cores' later development (spoiler: it didn't, really). He deftly moves through the ancient era, covering how agriculture and societies developed in the cores, and continues to move through all of history, comparing how West fared against East throughout.    Morris ties all of this review to a statistical scale he created to see which society was \\"winning\\" at each of the major points of history, based on how much energy the average person in each society could capture from the environment and turn into other things, the ability of each to organize, military projection strength, etc... I, and I'm sure many others have, could quibble with his list of criteria, but I actually think it's about as tidy and relevant a list as he makes it out to be, and he trumps the skeptic with his own reservations while also noting that, at some point, one must choose and move on.    More interesting than the east/west argument is the simple fact that, by his scale, humanity has advanced more in the past 300 years than it did in its first 300,000, and by a factor of ridiculous amount. That he suspects (probably rightly) that the East is soon to retake its lead over the West and end our centuries-long dominance over the globe becomes secondary to his final big point: that the human race is either going to come up with some unbelievable new solutions to get us over the current energy extraction/consumption crisis (The Singularity, as he calls it), or we're going to fail to find a solution and, as it has many, many times in our past, humanity is going to shatter and regress for a while (Nightfall).    It's in this latter part of the book where things begin to drag a bit. Well, \\"latter part\\" not counting the solid 30% of the book that is nothing but Appendix and Bibliography and footnotes (all three being very extensive and worth giving a once-over). After spending hundreds of pages arguing East vs. West, the last couple dozen pages are spent telling the reader that it doesn't matter because HEY we're all going to die or live in an unimaginable awesomeness freed from bio-fuels evil addiction, and it's going to happen REALLY BLOODY SOON.    In that sense, I find the book to be good in the same way that I enjoyed Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" (referenced more than once in this work) and other books of that stripe: a large amount of solid archaeological and historical work whiplashed at the end to support an attention-grabbing hypothesis designed to make one's name in the crowded, vicious world of academia.    If you keep that understanding firmly in your head during some of Mr. Morris' wilder flights of prognostication, you'll find that you still have an excellent one-volume read on the development of human society from its very genesis into the near future.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I was a little hesitant to purchase the Alien Anthology Blu-ray as I received the Anthology a few Christmases ago on DVD but I'm sure glad I did. Of course I'm a huge fan of the Alien series and have watched it many many times and it still frightens me BUT the blu-ray experience is unbelievable!! So crystal clear, the sound quality is amazing, and the added footage never before seen is wonderful. If you are a fan of this series, do yourself a favor & purchase this item or request it as a gift from someone. A GREAT HIGH DEF EXPERIENCE!
B001UFQNF0|5.0|Love this product, been a fan of the movies since I was a child. The only problem with it is there are a few scuff marks on the paint job, but other than that a very nice recreation. I highly recommend this for any fan of the BTTF Trilogy.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. Good characters, good plot, incredible images. I did catch things the second time I watched it that I missed the first time. so it stands up to re watching. There are things that confused me but for the most part it was a great movie and deserves all of the praise that it has gotten.
0670022411|5.0|I read about this book in my local newspaper and was immediately interested in the concept.  A witch vowing to live only as a human, despite her unusual and fascinating powers, a vampire who is also a geneticist who finds himself attached to this witch of a girl.  This was such an interesting story because Harkness twisted logic and gene theories with magic and blood sucking.<br /><br />Diana's parents' death affect her greatly, it is due to this that she gives up magic.  Matthew (vamp) can sense an evil lurking/dwelling/moving over the town, he realizes it is centered on one girl.  There is chemistry (both scientific and romantic) there is power... such great and terrifying power, and there is evil.  The two seem to connect, though not instantaneously, at least not on Diana's part. But it is doomed from the beginning.  When Diana's powers unconsciously grow out of her control she realizes that she might need more help than just the stubborn refusal to be a witch.<br /><br />I loved Harkness' novel.  It was so unique and interesting.  As an adult I always love it when young adult authors `smart' up their books and write them so that you have to think.  Not necessarily about the plot or a mystery, but about the genes, the theories behind it, the science in magic and so on.  For a debut novel this was surprisingly well written, and while it started off slow, I attribute that to building the story and characters rather than just trudging.  All in all I cannot wait for the sequel and I think it'll be even better.
1932100660|5.0|One reading of this valuable book isn't enough. The facts revealed about the insidious machinations of the meat producers of the United States to push the consumption of products known by them to be unhealthy are shocking. Learning that my life long belief that milk and dairy products are beneficial was an idea instilled by the dairy producers publicity machine was equally shocking.  I have been a vegetarian for many years, but the facts contained in The China Study have encouraged me change my diet to be almost completely vegan. The comparison between the Chinese diet which is high calorie but low protein and plant food based with the US and European diets of animal based, high protein diets and their effects on heart disease, cancer and diabetes and other auto immune diseases is the book's main point. Once one reads and absorbs the results of this extensive scientific study of large Chinese population groups, one must reconsider almost everything we in the Western world have been conditioned to believe about diet and nutrition.
B00322PKBW|1.0|Guess I was duped by the discription in the title of the watch. I wanted a wind-up watch. Don't know what up-wind means but this watch works on a battery NOT wind-up. I am NOT happy with the word game.
0312330537|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I absolutely LOVED this book more than any book I've ever read- and I real a lot. From the first page I was drawn in by the author's description of Bombay- I literally felt as if I was there myself. The first half of the book was a book about Bombay and its inhabitants. We were introduced to unforgettable characters like Karla, Ulla,Didier, Maurizio and the entire Leopolds crowd  of tourists and 'gora'. I felt as if the loveable slum-dwellers like Prabakar, Johnny Cigar, Qassim Ali, and the rest were my own friends. Their love of fellow humans and their happy demeanors made me love them even more. I do not think I will ever read a book that compares to this one. Nothing will be as satisfying and nothing will ever be able to give me such insight into a different lifestyle in a different country. When I approached the ending of this book I was not ready to put it down and honestly felt sad that 925 pages had gone by so quickly. Make no doubt about this book is truly wonderful and an escape from reality. Do not hesitate this book is truly amazing and should not be missed out on. I do hope that if they make a movie it can be as good as the book.

B0034G4P7G|5.0|I found this movie very interesting, but my husband was lost because he doesn't use Facebook. He felt that the character spoke so fast, he was hard to follow. I, on the other hand, understood that Eisenberg, being the brainiac that he was, probably spoke just like that. It was interesting the way that the movie went back and forth, using a yellow hue when going to the past.

0740797719|5.0|If I could give this book 6 stars I would immediately.    This book by Gurney is the most complete visual compendium of art in practice I have seen by any artist.  He shared everything over the years, he has learned about the practice and discipline of actually doing art.  His works of art show art thinking, the creative process, how an artist learns to master one art medium, then another.  Gurney also shows how all the mastery of the art mediums, attention to life & nature, come together to make great art.      Fans of Gurney's art might be interested in how he prepared & performed his art.  Most of them love seeing the final artwork.      For the professional artist & photographer, who wants to pursue their learning & improve their technique, this book is full of gems lavishly shared.      If you are a realist painter, looking for more inspiration, wanting to learn more about doing art, or just curious about how Gurney achieves his masterpieces, buy this book for your collection.
0385612931|3.0|This is the opening book to The Secrets of the Immortal Nicolas Flamel series. This book was a quick and easy read and I could tell the author did his research. I think he tried to cram too much information from different myths into one book. There were moments when his imagery and imagination drew you in, however in other places it could have used a little more subtlety. I am interested in reading the others I just don't think they are quite good enough to buy so that I can accomplish this task.
B001E52O7M|5.0|BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY:       Authors - W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne, distinguished Fellows of INSEAD, \\"the business school for the world, which brings together people, cultures and ideas from around the world to change lives and to transform organizations\\" [...] Major article contributors to name a few, ie., the Harvard Business Review, Financial Times, Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, etc. Both founders of the Value Innovation Network (VIN) and Value Innovation Action Tank (VIAT) in Singapore.      Summary - How do you create an uncontested market space and make the competition irrelevant?  The content of this book is based on the authors believe that high growth and profits can be generated to produce new demand in uncontested and untapped market space, or \\"Blue Ocean\\" versus \\"Red Ocean\\" strategy, which the competitive rules are known and the industries market space boundaries are defined.  Blue Ocean's proposed strategy is to differentiate between product/service and lower cost.      This book provides career professionals with creative, insightful innovative ideas through consideration of utility placed on value, price and a cost affective strategy approach to gain uncontested market space.  The impact of their strategies will enable a company to position themselves within new market space to sustain profit, growth and maneuver successfully through the worldwide sensitivities, competition and uncertainties affected by the factors and variables of a global economy. The authors provide proven cases, models strategies and examples which substantiate their approach.      What five things gleaned from this book regarding the importance of Blue Ocean Strategies are:            1.  Marketing leaders would be wise to consider the opportunities of redefining and reconstructing buyer value elements and innovation to create new forms of strategy leading to changes and discovery of recombination(s) and find new solutions to subsystem activities, to serve and reinforce an existing strategic position.             2.  Companies would do well to capture the mass of target buyers from the outset and expand the size of the market by offering radically superior value benefits at price points accessible to them.              3.  The focus of Blue Ocean Strategy does not restrict output at a high price but rather on creating new aggregate demand through a leap in buyer value at an accessible price. This creates a strong incentive, not only to reduce costs to the lowest possible level at the start but also to keep it that way over time to discourage potential free-riding imitators.            4.  Firms with monopolistic positions often do not focus on efficiency and cost reduction and hence consume more scarce resources, consumer demand drops and prices artificially increase.  The monopolistic practice, by consuming more of the society's resources, incurs dead weight loss for the society at large and achieved at the expense of consumers and society at large.              5.  Learning to develop a Blue Ocean Strategy approach of non-rival and non-excludable goods, such as knowledge, ideas and entrepreneur ingenuity cannot be reproduced and have potential to increase growth.     Concluding that Blue Ocean Strategy is based on a non-combative approach to a win-win break through in value achieved by innovation to create new forms of strategy leading to changes and discovery of recombination(s) and finding new solutions to subsystem activities, to serve and reinforce existing strategic position.  Buyers win and society at large benefits from improved efficiency.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|Been a while since we had some solid Yanni instrumental music. This album is more electric, more experimental than his \\"classics\\". It's clear he still has that creativeness to put together amazing melodies, but not afraid to combine it with new things and new styles. Yanni Voices was quite a departure to build upon is classic music with talented voices. Truth Of Touch takes that departure and puts it to use on new, original music. It's great to see the voices return with Leslie Mills, Chloe and the amazing and talented Nathan Pacheco.<br /><br />I fear some will not like this album. It might be too much of a departure from his classic orchestra and acoustic sounding music. It took me a few listens through to warm up, and I look at it as refreshing. Plus, we've already seen Yanni can really make his songs rock in concert, Voyage is just unbelievable and due to become a classic. Each song is unique and fresh, though \\"I'm So\\" could have been left out...it kind of drags down the back end of the album.<br /><br />Give this album some time and a few listens through, it's bound to fit right in with what Yanni is.
B004E547D8|5.0|I realize that age is a definite factor in this movie so I suppose I'm biased in its favor simply on the basis of being of \\"a certain age\\" (just slightly younger than Helen Mirren in fact). I'd like to think that's not the only reason I found it a frolicking good film, filled with lots of humor and no graphic violence (just the over-the-top comic book variety). It's smart, well written and has a stellar cast who pull off the whole thing with straight faces! I had a ... well, a blast!

B004DJ1O22|4.0|Had it been posted when I bought this that there were only 4 songs on this album I would probably would have thought twice before I ordered it. Only \\"Call It Stormy Monday\\" 9:00, \\"Pride & Joy\\" 6:01, \\"Ask Me No Questions\\" 5:01 and \\"Blues at Sunrise\\" 15:10 are on this particular version. After the first 3 songs they have included a little banter between Stevie & Albert that brings this to a little over 37 minutes of music & conversation. I should have known better than to expect the entire session to be included on one record and Amazon shows only one disc. This being said I only paid $13.09 for it and that makes it somewhat ok hence the 4 instead of 5 star rating. This is also regular weight vinyl not 180 gram or anything in between. Again not advertised but just to let you know. The sound is very good and the record played flawlessly. All in all the music & sound deserve 5 stars but the lack of more music pulls it down to 4 for me.  Also please note that on the copy I received the words \\"In Session\\" shown in the picture at the bottom are not on the jacket. On the vinyl label it does say \\"In Session\\".
B00005614M|5.0|An early collection of studio recordings from 1950 and 1949, The appropriately titled \\"Birth Of Cool\\" is  one of Jazz's first classic long player records.  Recorded for Capitol Records, Miles Davis leads a group of   virtuosic instrumentalists through a incredible set of free form jazz compositions.  As the title suggests, this record   marked the birth of a new kind of jazz.  The eleven songs presented here use more of a \\"big band\\" arrangement than most   other types of jazz, and they are generally short; most clock in at around three minutes. So unlike most free form jazz   which tends to meander all over the place, most of the solos and breaks here stay in place and, therefore, add a sense of   cohesiveness to the record.  Yet regardless of how short and cohesive the songs are, this is certainly not pop music, as   most of the songs don't follow conventional pop song structure.     This genre of jazz is known as West Coast Jazz or simply \\"cool\\".  And it's easy to see why it's called cool because   regardless of how chaotic or intense the music gets, there is a sense of restraint and mood.  The music is never too hot,  so one can cool off to it if you get my point. This was indeed the birth of a new era of jazz and jazz has never sounded   quite the same since.    This is a great introduction to Miles Davis' body of work not to mention an essential listen for serious jazz fans.  Those   who are more used to his more experiemental work like \\"Kind Of Blue\\" and \\"Bitches Brew\\" might have a harder time getting   into this record, but the effort is worth it.
B000VFGSI2|5.0|I am not a pianist. This review is purely subjective, and not meant to be authoritative. I find Glenn Gould's interpretations to be extremely attractive, perhaps because I was never schooled in piano, although I played other instruments. To me Gould had the ability to elucidate nuances that put more conventional technique on a less accessible basis. While he was famous for his Bach treatments, he seems to have had a similar approach of trying to extract deeper meaning from all composers' works that he performed.    With Beethoven, his liner notes indicate, that meant looking beyond what he thought of as relatively thin thematic material in these three sonatas, the Pathetique, the Moonlight, and the Appassionata. He actually cites what he says is \\"egoistic pomposity\\" on Beethoven's part to describe what Gould implies was an impulse to satisfy the audiences of that day. Incidentally, Gould's irreverence for the deities we have made of some of the great composers is also very refreshing. He seems to occupy a niche where he can see through the music to the person who wrote it.    The point is that even though Gould can seemingly mock Beethoven, he serves him better than almost anybody else. Gould is the most consistent pianist for seizing the listener's attention and emotional response. If anyone thinks he plays \\"too slowly\\" because of inadequate technique, they should listen more carefully. I believe his technique was the equal of anybody's, while his interpretations are uniquely involving.    This recording has excellent sound. Though the works were performed in 1967, in a New York studio, with what sometimes sounds like an upright piano, I believe the sound is very clean and undistorted. Certainly we can detect Gould's self-accompanying sotto voce subtly modulating the keyboard sounds. I am very happy with this CD.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book takes place in Virginia 1793 forward. The characters were wonderfully written and really gives you the feel of what went on during that period.How isolated people were. the 2 main characters tell the story from each perspective. One a young Irish girl raised with the slaves from the age of 7, and the other from a young black girl who takes the role of her care giver. How each is affected during this time of slaves and indeture.  The journey is sad at times and is really well written. I recomend this book highly. It was a very fast read!!!
0439023513|5.0|Wow, what an amazing book in every possible way.    I actually care about these characters, all the way through to the very end.  The author does an excellent job of helping the reader see the other characters through Katniss' eyes.  As a result, those whom she comes to love and need in her life, the reader comes to love as well.  Those she hates, the reader despises right along with her.  When things happen to certain characters, the reader feels the same pain or joy that Katniss feels.  That is the sign of a powerful story-teller, to get the reader to care, deeply, about the people in the story.    As for Katniss herself, she is one of the most fully developed, most complex characters that I have ever seen.  She does not always make good decisions.  Her choices and motivation range from purely selfish to completely noble, sometimes on the same page.  The important thing to remember is that she is a 17-year-old girl in this book.  Before the things that have happened in the last year to her, all she ever wanted was to care for her sister and mother.  In her small world in District 12, she knew the rules and knew whom she could trust.  Now, she is thrust into a world where she has no idea of the rules, and no idea whom to trust.  People she loves deeply are taken from her (as noted before, the story is told so well that the reader feels her pain).  Her reactions, thoughts, and choices always seem completely natural; she does not always choose correctly, but her actions make sense with what she knows and with what she has experienced. This is another example of wonderful story-telling.  Nothing is given to this girl; all events and outcomes are earned naturally, both the good and the horrific.    Along those lines, her final choice between Gale and Peeta is handled with great skill.  There are no forced events or story-telling cheats to help her arrive at her decision; it's just a girl finally deciding whom she can't live without.  After all that has happened, thereis no way that she could choose the other boy because the love and trust that were once there are gone.      The epilogue was beautiful.  I was so concerned about a blissfully happy ending, but Katniss, for all her goodness and power, does not get a \\"happily ever after\\", not in a traditional or contrived sense, at least.  Again, her choices make sense, the life that she is leading makes sense.  The events during the Hunger Games and afterward have changed her.  No one, after experiencing things like that, is going to be at complete peace.  It is clear that everything that has happened in this story is going to stay with her forever.    Which makes sense, because this story is going to stay with me for a long time as well.
0439023491|5.0|I am going to refer to certain events that should be considered plot spoilers.  At least, these events caught me completely off-guard and helped me to realize that the second book was going to be even more powerful and brutal than the first.<br /><br />The first event (plot spoiler warning) that caught me off guard was the announcement at the Quarter Quell that the Capitol is going to use past victors to compete in that year's Games.  Considering the number of victors from District 12, it is obvious who will be going.  What makes this moment so powerful is that by this point, Katniss and Peeta had some of the best literary friends I've had, due largely to the skill with which the author develops them and lets us get to know them.  Even worse, during their tour together, it is obvious that their relationship is becoming more real and not just an attempt to trick the Capitol.  The author delivers this news and follow-up with great imagery and power; I felt sick in my gut that these two kids are going to have to go through all that horror again.  Even worse, there is no way both of them are going to be able to survive again.  In addition the sad prospects for these two beloved characters is the sadness on reflecting on some of the other victors; as Katniss points out, some of them are too old and sick to compete, yet their government is going to force them in again anyway; one of the victors even has children she'll be leaving behind.  All of these people have some kind of life and loved ones they're leaving behind.<br /><br />The second stomach punch (another plot spoiler, if you kept reading after the first one) is when the victors are doing their interviews on stage.  Most of the victors subtly attack the government's decision to force them back.  They play on the audience's sympathies.  Katniss, of course, is the most successful in playing to the crowd, due to the love story angle and the dress she wears.  Peeta drives it even further home with his announcements.  The author notes that the crowd was almost revolting at this point.  Again, since the author had done such a remarkable jog in developing Katniss and Peeta, I was actually cheering and hoping that they would not have to go in again.  This hope was dashed, though, when Haymitch points out the obvious, the show must go on.  I actually felt despair, because one of these kids was going to die and the other would have to carry on with the revolution alone.  What concerned me was that the survivor would be fundamentally changed and damaged by this.<br /><br />There were other powerful moments as well, but these two are perfect examples of what the author was able to do to me as the reader.  She got me to care completely about these characters.  I felt joy, sick, concerned, happiness, and despair as events unfolded.  This takes a great amount of skill.  Most books I read just to get done.  However, this book I kept reading because the author accomplished something that just doesn't happen that often.  She got me to become completely emotionally invested in what happened to these people.  A rare skill, indeed.The author notes that the crowd was almost revolting at this point.

B004H8GM3K|5.0|Black Hawk Down is a masterful telling of the Battle of Mogadishu and the bravery of the Rangers, Special Forces, pilots, and Combat Controllers who fought there. The book does a better job than the movie of explaining the situation around the snatch and grab raid that went south. It details the situation in Somalia in the period leading up to the battle in great detail. It makes the story flow better.<br /><br />The writing is done well. Mark Bowden is an excellent writer who manages to capture the sheer terror of being trapped with nowhere to go and no hope for rescue in the immediate future. It was a fight for their lives, and he catches some of that. He also does a nice job of portraying the extreme bravery that was exhibited in that firefight. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to see a bit of what our fighting men and women experience every day. It's a good book that I couldn't put down any of the times I've read it.
B004BBDHEK|4.0|As a true Yanni's music fan for decades, I should say that this album is good but not great.<br />Yanni is experiencing new styles & sounds for recent years which make his music kind of different compare<br />to his golden years (mid 1980- 2000) with those unique & heavenly melodies we all love.<br /><br />As we know, time changes everything; life, emotions, technology, music,...<br /><br />Yanni became famous in 1993 with Acropolis concert when he colored his great music for first time with real orchestral instruments & world class<br />musicians. and then followed by 'Tribute' project. Those brought his studio music to life & to the world. He raised the bar so high with those soulful<br />songs that some of us now don't get full satisfaction by listening to new ones...<br /><br />I hope this new album 'Truth of touch' be a good framework for Yanni to do it again.<br /><br />He is the best.<br /><br />You'll enjoy this album
B000002VC5|5.0|I bought the cassette in the bargain bin of the grocery store I worked at as a teen in 1978 because I liked the cover art, not really knowing what to expect. Now 33 years and a lot of changes later - lots of music has come and gone but I still listen to this album from start to finish at least once a month while I work. Good investment.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|great book. i had read the percy jackson series and decided to give this book a try. the action and build up constantly surprised me. i had many a sleepless night reading the book. i give it a four because the constant changes for the point of view confused me at most times. overall it is a good book for all ages
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The book was realllly good.  It was a great way to end the series.  I still had a dificult time keeping up with the characters, but that was minor.  I hope everyone is able to read it.<br />This would be a great movie.  I saw the girl with the dragon tattoo, but the subtitles i think takes away from the movie.  it was still good.  i hope they make a movie in america over this book.  it is reallly good.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|When I first saw the The Tudors we had Showtime.  We watched the 1st Season and part of the second. We really enjoyed it but did not get to view the entire series so I decided to purchase the entire series and am very glad we did.  Now we can view the whole series from the beginning to the end at our leasure.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|After hearing so many positive reviews, I was inspired to purchase my own DVD copy. I was not disappointed. This is on the same dramatic level as \\"GONE BABY GONE\\"... Affleck both co-wrote the screenplay and starred in the movie. Jeremy Renner is fabulous to watch! If you like drama and action, this is your movie!

B000002KAT|5.0|\\"Van Morrison's Astral Weeks was released ten years, almost to the day, before this was written. It was particularly important to me because the fall of 1968 was such a terrible time: I was a physical and mental wreck, nerves shredded and ghosts and spiders looming and squatting across the mind. My social contacts had dwindled to almost none; the presence of other people made me nervous and paranoid. I spent endless days and nights sunk in an armchair in my bedroom, reading magazines, watching TV, listening to records, staring into space. I had no idea how to improve the situation and probably wouldn't have done anything about it if I had.     Astral Weeks would be the subject of this piece - i.e., the rock record with the most significance in my life so far - no matter how I'd been feeling when it came out. But in the condition I was in, it assumed at the time the quality of a beacon, a light on the far shores of the murk; what's more, it was proof that there was something left to express artistically besides nihilism and destruction. It sounded like the man who made Astral Weeks was in terrible pain, pain most of Van Morrison's previous works had only suggested; but like the later albums by the Velvet Underground, there was a redemptive element in the blackness, ultimate compassion for the suffering of others, and a swath of pure beauty and mystical awe that cut right through the heart of the work     I don't really know how significant it might be that many others have reported variants on my initial encounter with Astral Weeks. I don't think there's anything guiding it to people enduring dark periods. It did come out at a time when a lot of things that a lot of people cared about passionately were beginning to disintegrate, and when the self-destructive undertow that always accompanied the great sixties party had an awful lot of ankles firmly in it's maw and was pulling straight down. so, as timeless as it finally is, perhaps Astral Weeks was also the product ofan era. Better think that than ask just what sort of Irish churchwebbed haints Van Morrison might be product of\\"     (Lester Bangs)

076115728X|5.0|This is a wonderful book!  I wish I would have had this a few years ago but happy to have found it now.  We have a child with a very controlling personality who, at a very early age, would get so upset if something wasn't perfect.  If paper ripped or something spilled, they would have a meltdown.  We have tried to show them time after time that you can make something creative and new with the situation.  Hearing it from your parents and seeing it in print are two different things!  Our child LOVES to read so this is wonderful!  A wonderful idea that has been put into print!   Highly recommend for everyone.  A great teaching tool to help instill flexibility and positive thinking, and creatively addressing unexpected situations.  Also a great great great book for parents (new and old).  For \\"new\\" parents to find fun instead of frustration, and for \\"established\\" parents to remind them to find the fun in the small stuff!!!!  (Short book though .....wish it were longer because it is so good!)
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I initially caught a 30 second clip of Winter Winds on TV and googled the lyrics because it sounded pretty good. I listened to the clips on Amazon and was impressed enough to purchase the CD (which I rarely do these days). Once I got to listen to the album in it's entirety I was blown away. It's incredible from beginning to end! I listen to it non-stop and even have my wife and daughter into it now. Would love to see them live, hope they come my way soon.
B001P9KR94|2.0|The movie was okay, but I doublt if I will watch it again.    Note that if you plan on watching this movie say after dinner or whatever, be sure to start the movie BEFORE you start to eat.    I have the blu-ray version and you are forced to watch about 20 minutes of movie reviews WITHOUT fast forward or remote control jump to disk menu.    That's crazy. Can you imagine watching half of the movie and you lose power for a minute.  There is no way to restart the movie without sitting thru those first 20 minutes LOCKED OUT of video control.    This is for the blu-ray version ... could be the std version has a way of getting to the main menu using a  remote button.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I loved this movie too, as did my husband, which totally surprised me.  It was glitzy and glamorous and fun.  The costumes were terrific, the songs were great (I bought the soundtrack)as well as the cast.  Who can not like Stanley Tucci too! He always seems to be a fan favorite.  I really learned to appreciate Christina Aguilara's talent.  The little girl with the big voice. That girl can really sing.  And then there's Cher.  She really doesn't age, and still has that unique, great voice. Like someone else said, \\"if you're sick of shoot em up, blow em up movies\\" go and enjoy yourself with this movie.  I liked seeing Julianne Hough in her movie debut too.  She did a nice job, and I know we'll see more of her.  In fact I think she's starring in the remake of Footloose. I'm glad it's coming out, soon, on DVD.  I will buy it.
0395389496|5.0|This book has become part of our Christmas reading, along with Skipping Christmas,A Christmas Dress for Ellen, Twas the Night Before Christmas, and others. My kids love the story and so do I. Just a beautiful story and the pictures are perfect. It helps set the mood for Christmas. After reading the book my children were not pleased with the movie.
0596805888|5.0|Fun to read, some very good information and even some recipes I want to use (duck confit, anyone).  Bought it for my 85 year old dad (who is enjoying it), then another for myself.  Read it straight through, then loaned it to a geek grrl friend.  gotta get it back...
B0048LPRCS|4.0|Why people consider Gasper Noe this amazing director I've yet to figure out. But while I don't consider him great personally, I do believe that he's... different. Different can be good. And Enter the Void perfectly represents his different-ness. From the very beginning of Enter the Void you know you're entering a Gasper Noe creation, and for any who may have seen Irreversible, a small feeling of dread starts to manifest during the flashy, seizure inducing opening credits.<br /><br />Luckily for Enter the Void, it takes a step in its own direction and seperates itself quickly from Irreversible and becomes its own film (that's not saying anything bad about Irreversible). It opens in Japan, in the apartment of our two main characters as they introduce the theme of the story: death and afterlife. Without revealing too much, the lead character Oscar ends up taking a psychodelic trip through the world in which he created for himself, both past, present, and future. We the audience get to the witness all the events that lead to where he now finds himself. It's an uncomfortable journey, but one well-worth watching as Oscar's story is both interesting and terribly heartbreaking.<br /><br />Enter the Void explores a multitude of uncomfortable subjects, including hard drug use, incest (implied), and abortion, to name only a few. And as is Noe's want, you're forced to experience these subjects rather than just view them. It can be quite disturbing at times. Also of note is the strong sexual content throughout the film. All of that shouldn't be surprising for fans of Gasper Noe....<br /><br />Where this movie goes wrong, however, is in its length. Gasper Noe tries way to hard sometimes, and the extended camera transitions and constant flashing lights actually creates a kind of distraction. These moments make the film seem so much longer than what it is (it's already two plus hours long). There are plenty of moments in the film where you can fast-forward is miss nothing beyond dizzying camera movement. This alone was enough to take a star away from this film.<br /><br />Gasper Noe's Enter the Void is no Requiem for a Dream but it has the same effect. It's troubling, disturbing, and warns against the dangers of drug use. Also fans of Gasper Noe will be getting exactly what they expect, a drug-enduced piece of art. Obviously not recommended for the casual viewer, fans of cinema of all kinds will love this movie, at least for the first watch.This alone was enough to take a star away from this film.

0670022411|4.0|Most of the patrons and staff at the Oxford University Bodleian Library are paranormals consisting of three species: witches, daemons and vampires; though there are some humans also.  Visiting American witch Yale professor Diana Bishop is at the library conducting research into ancient alchemy tomes when she uncovers the Ashmole 782 manuscript that may provide insight into the origins of the species.  Using her paranormal skills, as the offspring of two powerful but deceased witches, Diana uses an enchantment to open the tome.<br /><br />Her incantation leads 1,500 years old vampire Matthew Clairmont to Bishop as well as the now, freed by her, undead who want their accidental liberator dead in case she can reverse what she wrought.  Breaking the class taboo, the witch and the vampire team up to keep her safe while they investigate the origin of the species.  As their attraction grows, many of the paranormal want both dead for breaking the laws of nature that forbids cross species relationships.<br /><br />Although over the top of Sir Christopher Wren's Tom Tower, A Discovery of Witches is a great academic fantasy in which readers will feel Deborah Harkness put a spell on us.  Fast-paced with an underlying social theme and a nod to Darwin, a world of four sentient species sharing the famous library and fragile peace makes for a fun start to an engaging tale.  Diana the intellectual witch and her undead protector are a fine team escorting the audience through lethal maize of paranormal who want them dead.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000PC8AFU|2.0|If you are a fan of Stevie Ray Vaughan ?? Well, I guess it depends on how ... \\"Fanatical\\" a fan you are ?  If you think ANYTHING he was ever involved in was Great? You will love this just as well.  If you Loved his talent and skills as an artist, and Really Liked HIS Music ?--- I think your going to be Disappointed.     I didn't believe the Negative Reviews on the page. They all seemed to get lost in a metaphysical \\"Hissy Fit\\" over the Evil Corrupt Record Companies continuing to \\"Milk\\" poor SRV after his death. Their complaints sounded more like comments on society and less about the Music.    I Love SRV's Music, his Talent as a Musician, I could only Pray to ever have as much ability as just one of his fingers. I Love His Music......Sadly, This Is Not His Music.    This \\"Album\\" is really just a collection of studio tracks and some music from other artists albums where SRV was \\"Sitting in\\" and maybe \\"Playing a few licks\\"   This is Stevie helping out Other Artists, Not Stevie \\"Doing his own Thing\\"    Some of these tracks ..... My God, If you didn't TELL ME Stevie played on them, I would NEVER Have Guessed --- and Probably would have argued with you even after you told me. There are a few that are downright Silly Sounding, others are just annoying. The Live version of \\"The Sky is Crying\\" is Great, Good Stevie and the Bright Spot on this otherwise dismal album. a few other tracks didn't make me want to scream for my money back, but I honestly can't say I would have Happily PAID for them, if I had Known what I was in for either.    Overall, Im VERRRRRYYY DISAPOINTED in this. I already have Two version of \\"Sky Crying\\" on other albums. While it is different here and has some other \\"Great's\\" playing on the track, it is not enough to have a 3rd copy of ONE SONG that was great, with a few so, so's and quite a few \\"Turn That Stuff Off's\\" to make this an album worth recommending.    Again, for Hard Core SRV FANATICS anything he touched, looked at, smelled or smiled at, you will love, and that includes this.    For those of us who Really Loved \\"HIS SOUND\\", Be Warned, Your Not Going to Hear His Sound Here.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Got both seasons for so cheap, basically just paid the shipping cost. This is the best sitcom ever made, or at least the best sitcom of the 90s. The best of 2000s is How I Met Your Mother, if you want another sitcom that is insanely funny (with more crude humor but still quality). Fast shipping by the seller. Some older episodes they don't play on TV are on this set so get it!
031603438X|2.0|The first third or so of this book is pretty good reading -- his childhood in the dreariness of postwar England, the perils of the British school system, his enrapturement with the blues, the nuts and bolts of how one of the greatest rock bands ever came to be. But the rest of the book is forgettable, at best, and childish, at worst. Keith may remember it all, as he claims on the dust jacket's front flap, but he's chosen to either skip over or reinterpret a lot of it. There's not much to learn, here. Keith is a pharmacy with feet -- we know, we know. This book corroborates the truth that Keith's legendary status in the world of rock and roll is due more to his opiate-laced persona than his guitar-playing ability.    Long live Mick Taylor!!!
B001HPP2XW|5.0|This is one classic movie and one of my favorites. It's a quirky, kookie, and funny romantic comedy, written by Truman Captoe and directed by Blake Edwards, about a young woman with a small town background who's come to NYC in search of a rich man to marry (hence the name Breakfast at Tiffany's) and instead meets a struggling young (and broke) writer who unwittingly tosses a monkey wrench into her plans. It is Audrey Hepburn at her most beautiful best and George Peppard at his most handsome. I even named my cat after her cat in the movie. I simply call him \\"Cat\\". After all, as Holly Golightly says..Why give a cat a name if he won't come when he's called? (And incidentally, the Oscar winning soundtrack is wonderful.)
0226264211|5.0|This book was written quite a while ago, by current standards, but it contains wisdom that our country needs desperately now. Friedman's analyses of many aspects of our current plight are incisive, and tie in closely with the work of von Mises and Hayek. It should be much more widely read and heeded than it is. Incidentally, it was written by Friedman himself; Rose Friedman only prepared it for postumous  reissue.

B003EYVXTG|4.0|Alternately dangerous, dreary, and tense, \\"Winter's Bone\\" concerns a teenage girl (Jennifer Lawrence) trying to save the few worldly possessions enjoyed by her mother and siblings. Set in the Ozark mountains of Missouri, 17 year old Ree has to find her missing-in-action father and make sure he shows up for a court date; otherwise the bail bonds company will take the modest family house Ree's father put up as his bail collateral.<br /><br />Ree's search for her father puts her in contact with various dangerous types, most outright criminals and most, unfortunately, related to Ree. And everything is set against a social backdrop maybe one or two small steps above outright poverty.<br /><br />Despite the grim story and the grim setting, there are one or two rays of hope, a couple of sympathetic characters, and the small chance that things might just work out. I won't say any more, other than the movie isn't as relentlessly grim as the ads and trailers make it look. But it is mostly grim. Oh, I should also report that the story is well told, sensitively acted, and in its own understated way, elegantly produced. I enjoyed it and can see why it made the cut as one of this year's ten Best Picture nominees.<br /><br />\\"Winter's Bone\\" looks and sounds great on standard DVD and there are a variety of interesting extra features, including about 45 minutes of behind-the-scenes material that really makes you want to hand it to director Debra Granik.  Seeing what little she had to work with (small budget, people's actual houses and yards used as sets, the bulk of the actors picked up via a casting call held in a school gym, etc.), it's amazing that \\"Winter's Bone\\" turned out as well as it did.
0307272702|5.0|Welcome to the future that is our past.     First, a caveat: I already knew, understood, and believed virtually everything that was in this book before I read it due to years of previous study as a nutritionist. I also believe there is another way of knowing: through the body. I eat the way Taubes describes.     Now to my point: I heard an interview with GT where he stated something along the lines that the research required to write this book and his previous \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" would not have been possible in one lifetime without the internet. Taking this into consideration helps us understand how a book can be so incredibly thoroughly researched and come to so many mind-blowing conclusions about the nature of virtually every major chronic and degenerative disease epidemic we are living in, i.e. \\"the diseases of civilization\\".    I really hope this book makes some noise and pisses people off and creates a tide of \\"cognitive dissonance\\" that rumbles through this country. A country where so many people have completely abdicated all responsibility for independent and critical thinking, believing what the whitecoats, or Michelle Obama, say(s) about nutrition. The information Taubes relates is not new. It is both 2.5 million years old, and it is roughly 50-100 years old, meaning the modern science that supports his conclusions had been carried out long ago. A work like this would only be controversial in a society as insane as ours.    In 5 to 10 years, this book will be looked back on as the turning point. If you want to quibble over whether he's right or not, I recommend you first go volunteer in a hospital that treats children with type 2 diabetes. Then see if your are motivated to understand or be open to this perspective with a little more urgency.     The book: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B003V4AK8E|5.0|First off let me say this is by far the best controller for the PS3 out there. I have always been a Xbox owner and will always be loyal to xbox; however, I decided to get a PS3 for the exclusive games (especially The Show). Anyways, the controller works great and I had absolutely no problems functionality wise; however, the player indication light was not working properly. So I contacted customer service at Power A and I immediately recieved an email back asking for my address so they can send me out a new USB Dongle, due to the fact the 3.5 PS3 update bugged the Player Indication light on 3rd Party controllers. Since Sony will not release a new update for this issue, Power A sent out a new USB dongle at no cost to me and I received it in 3 days from the complaint issued date. Now my controller works even better and the Player Indicator works as intended. I highly recommend this product to all!
0307266303|5.0|This was a great book and I definitely recommend it to any runner.  He does go a little too deep, in my opinion, in trying to sell you on barefoot running and the evolution of man but if you can get over that it is great.    Awesome story and you can't deny that the best runners in the world are running barefoot or with small leather shoes.  We have a long way to catch up to them.    Gripping story!  Thanks!
B003UESJIS|5.0|I thought Happy Go Lucky was Mike Leigh's best film and Another Year does not quite match that high standard.  Still, it is a wonderful character study, a slowly unspooling story of how people make themselves -- yes -- happy or unhappy through their actions and, in some cases, their self-deception.  Many scenes from Another Year remain with me a couple weeks after seeing the film -- Tom and Gerri having tea under a makeshift shelter as they are caught in the rain at their community garden patch; the awkward moment when the sad sack Mary brings them a bottle of Argentine wine because she thinks they visited there; the near catatonic mourning of Tom's brother at the loss of his wife; and late in the film Gerri telling Mary that people have to take responsibility for their lives.  None of the events in the movie are hyped beyond what they are -- scenes in lives well or not-so-well lived through one year, and the implication that the year, portrayed so well by all the actors and Leigh's unobtrusive direction, is a microcosm of all the years of the characters's lives.
0316044695|5.0|This book is an excellent recount of the experiences Marcus Luttrell.  It is as entertaining and gripping as any military/super-spy novel except that this one is real!    I'm not sure why the very small minority gets mad because he has a different political view than theirs (very little politics at all in the book).  The events happened regardless of one's belief.    This truly is a great book which makes me proud to be an American and proud of the military that is fighting for our freedom.  Awesome story!
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Many people complained about this season not being written by Amy Sherman-Palladino, but I think the complaints are completely unfounded. Speaking as someone who watched the entire series successively on DVD, there is nothing sub-par, odd, or lacking about this last season. The sixth season, on the other hand, was rather depressing, focused probably too much on Lorelai and Rory's romances, and lost much of the beauty of their mother-daughter relationship. The seventh season, somewhat miraculously, put the show to rights. It fixed the things that were left tangled by the previous season, and it was charming and enjoyable to watch. Of course, it would have been great if the show had continued on, but the finale episode was still beautiful. It didn't explain all the things people may want to know about Rory and Lorelai's futures, but the show was basically always about Rory growing up and her relationship with Lorelai. It ended well and is definitely worth a purchase.
0634049011|5.0|I have played guitar for about 20 years.  I was looking for a book to help a friend who is a beginner as I was struggling with how I would explain 20 years of knowledge.  I went through the exercises myself in order to determine if I wanted to recommend this book.  What I found was that the exercises really helped me have a better understanding of the fretboard.  I can now find specific notes much more quickly and have a complete understanding of how scales are formed.  I have only worked through the first 6 chapters but have already become a much better player.  The exercises are short,concise, and to the point which maintains my interest.  I will continue and complete the entire book.  I would highly recommend this book to any beginner student and to anyone who is self taught and wants to \\"pull everything together\\" with a better understanding of the entire fretboard.

B003N2O5V2|2.0|I was at page 130 or so when I realized that there was still no plot to this book. Nothing had happened. But I got my fill of hetero and lesbian sex and images of violence. When the plot did finally arrive, it was predictable this time, except for the family tree, which then became a little tiresome.  I won't ruin it, but I suppose I know what book 3 will be about already, more of the same, running around Sweden leaving a trail of mayhem. The first book was incredible, if you are able to ignore or brush aside the social engineering, which was pushed at every opportunity. Otherwise, very emotional and a great read.  This second book had none of the compelling aspects the first one did. Almost pointless.<br />Larsson died of heart attack right after finishing, but before writing his will, so only heirs will reap the rewards.  So don't feel bad about not buying this one.

0321200683|4.0|Overall I found this book a worthwhile read, but at times I was really torn.    The pattern catalog is really good and very inspiring. I particularly liked how each pattern was described more as a set of diagrams than through specific code examples. This is a patterns book which is so easy to read that you could give it to a project manager and he or she would be able to understand a lot of it :)    On the other hand I found much of the text to be a tad on the trivial side. I think the text could have been condensed a lot without detracting from the overall picture.    While the patterns catalog is good, the code examples are really bad. Perhaps it was because I was reading the book in the light of CQRS, but I read each pattern described as an autonomous component. Then when you get to the examples, you get a big pile of tightly coupled Spaghetti code that uses inheritance for reuse and seems to be focused on anything other than asynchronous messaging. To add spite to injury, at least the C# code was so far from being idiomatic that it made me wonder whether the authors had ever used it before.    The last chapter that looks ahead at the 'future' (as seen from 2004) is already so dated that it's a waste of time.    I'd still recommend the book, but you can easily skip most of the example chapters, as well as the last chapter.

B002U0KHMY|5.0|Smart writing, strong acting, and super-addictive! _White Collar_ is fast-paced and lots of fun. Matt Bomer commands the screen as he shifts identities and pulls off all kinds of cons ... all the name of the law. There's a strong supporting cast here, lots of tantalizing mystery, and gorgeous shots of New York. You can start anywhere -- each episode is a self-contained caper, but the whole thing adds up to a well-crafted arc.    You can tell the cast and writers are having a blast with this one ... and you will too! Highly recommended.
031603438X|3.0|The hard bound book I received was stamped with the words Queens Library and had a call number on the binding.  When I wrote to the sender about this they told me that sometimes libraries donate books to them that are overstocked.  Seems kind of weird that a public library would donate to a commercial enterprise.
0763628182|4.0|Jan Pienkowski, Haunted House (Candlewick, 2005)<br /><br />Fun pop-up with a few surprising/inventive uses of the technique (though when considering my use of \\"inventive\\", also consider that I'm 42 and thus was most immersed in pop-up culture back in the early seventies). Would have preferred something a little closer to a story, but as a simple piece of art, it does its thing. Check it out of the library before deciding whether to add it to your permanent collection to see if the lack of story affects the kiddies' desire for repeated exposure. *** ½
0385732554|4.0|The Giver is a book that appeals to a wide audience. A wide array of ages can enjoy it because it is an easy read, has a good plot and keeps the reader on their toes, guessing what will come next in the book. I read this book for school when I was 10 and enjoyed it. I recently revisted the book and enjoyed it even more the second time. I think that Lois Lowry is a wonderful author because she writes in a way that intrigues but helps the reader maintain clear comprehension

B001GCUNYO|4.0|Do you like Jason Bourne movies?  If you do, get TAKEN.  You won't be disappointed.  The movie is basically a 50 year old Jason Bourne (played by Liam Neeson) trying to save his daughter.  The movie is intense and action packed.  Plus, it really makes you wonder what kind of world we really live in.
B002ZG980U|2.0|The movie had to much going on. I think I got what the movie was about but, not really sure. Dreams within a dream concept.
B004IFYN2Y|5.0|Fair Game is one of the best politically themed films in quite some time - an equally riveting and well told story of the Bush administration's leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame's identity to the general public. I highly recommend this movie no matter what side of the political spectrum you are on - if for nothing more than two see the two Oscar-worthy performances of Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.  The movie is great, and the final sequence of the film is one of the year's best.
0316098337|5.0|Wonderful book!  The author captured and described emotions with perfection. Story being told through Jack's eyes (little 5 year old being held in the room with his ''Ma') is brilliant idea....
B001EO748M|5.0|Great historical series. Have been interested in history all my life....read lots of books. This series added to my historical knowledge and was fun to watch too.
B004JVXTL8|5.0|This is not really anything new compared to the first one, which is a good thing.  It's EXACTLY what I wanted to see, but had enough surprises to keep me more interested.  Same premise: normal family, something weird starts to happen, all hell breaks loose.  This story takes place two months before the events of the first movie, and ending with the end of the first movie, but that's all I can relay without spoiling anything.  We obviously know something is up because of the relation to Katie Featherstone who makes multiple appearances in the film (her sister is the main subject along with her baby) (oh and Katie is still gorgeous).  Like with the first movie the \\"normal people\\" acting is done really well, which is hard to do, so it gives it sense of a really well filmed \\"family documentary\\".  There's a little more \\"backstory\\" that's introduced to give us an idea of what may be going on.  There are a few flubs with cuts/edits (i.e. missing items from the previous scene), but overall this is a good time.  The ending is pretty sweet.  Very violent and very \\"dude...that's messed up.\\"  So, I'll give it 5 stars to balance out the 1 star it was given.  This is a really good supernatural thriller.  You should watch it in the dark, really loud to get the full \\"OMG\\" effect.  Good times.
0880796863|3.0|not a bad product.  the cards are all well made and look very original, the packaging is very bright and tidy. unfortunatly the \\"instructions\\" leave alot to be desired. the explaination of each card is not detailed nor are a variety of spreads presented to you.  they are also written on a very small book.  if you want a beautiful ( but not original ) tarot deck i would strongly recommend Mystic Dreamer Tarot (Book & Cards) Heidi Darras, Barbara Moore. if u already know how to read the cards and are looking for an original deck thank this is the one for you.

0553381687|1.0|After being told just how great the series is by several people and reading all the glowing reviews, I started reading this book. What a disappointment!  The whole thing was just an endless soap opera of cliched, flat characters in a story that doesn't go anywhere. Now I'm being told that the next book is better, really! I think I'll explore the shelves for something with more varied characterization and a world that isn't an obvious cut-n-paste job.
0452295548|3.0|I am an undergraduate taking a course in Clinical Neuropsychology. We read this book as well as a textbook chapter on the organization and function of the brain. In this book, Jill Bolte Taylor describes a road from the stroke to full recovery in time period of about eight years. Anyone who has met stroke survivors during their lifetime knows that it is truly remarkable. What also seams amazing to me is Jill's attitude towards the changes that her body and personality went through. Her book depicts how she embraces that change; especially the sense of inner peace, Nirvana even, that she claims the stroke brought her.<br /><br />Jill experiences her stroke at age thirty-seven, at first not even identifying the process that brain was going through. Stroke is usually associated with older members of the population. What Jill goes through is not a classic stroke, but rather the AVM hemorrhage. This kind of a stroke is caused by faulty wired vascular system, where arteries go straight to veins, instead of going through capillaries. The hemorrhage covered parts of Jill's motor cortex, sensory cortex, orientation association cortex, Broca's Area, Wernicke's area in her left hemipshere. The left hemisphere is responsible for linear thinking process, such as reading, writing, mathematics etc. During the morning of the stroke, Jill wakes up with a horrible headache. Then she gets up and feels balance leaving her body, as the headache persisted. Eventually when she realizes what is happening to her, and tries to get help her ability to understand and produce speech radically diminishes. In a hospital Jill realizes that shutting down part of her left brain allowed her right brain to flourish and bring her a sense of being one with the world.<br /><br />People going through what Jill did will have quite different experiences that her. People affected by the same kind of stroke, emerge from it with different outcomes, because no two brains are the same. Each brain contains lots of neurons that have established unique connections with other neurons. A stroke damages these connections and/or neurons. Unfortunate for stroke victims, neurons in the brain and spinal cord do not regenerate; however, remaining neurons in the area build new connections, allowing victims to recover. Making new connections requires a lot of hard work from the patient, as well as his or her caregivers, family members, and friends. Jill was lucky that her mother, G.G. took good care of her and supported her recovery, presenting her daughter with a lot of patience and understanding. Other stroke survivors may not be as lucky to have family members coping with their injury well and successfully understanding what a stroke victim needs. Other victims may not be as optimistic as Jill was and instead stall their recovery through lack of trying after repeated failures of completing tasks.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the first half of the book, where Jill talks about her experiences of the stroke, the medical treatment that she has received, as well as her recovery. However, I do think that it is impossible for Jill to remember in such detail what happened to her on the day of her stroke, when her reasoning was clearly impaired. I was disappointed with the second half of the book, when Jill stops talking about her recovery and talks about achieving the feeling of unity with the world through her right hemisphere. I can understand that she embraces her right hemisphere, but I do not think that it is possible to turn your thoughts off.  I also dislike that a trained scientist talks about new age stuff, making angels, and transmitting energy from one human being to another. As scientist Jill should not devote more that one short chapter to such matters, since it is impossible to prove whether they actually work or not.
0061726826|5.0|It would be an understatemant to say this is my new favorite book.  I am in my late 30's and a librarian who has read WAY more books than I could count - especially teen books.  This book is not just a brilliant story, it is written with the kind of writing talent that comes around once or twice in a generation at most. I love teen books and I am partial to dystopian fiction, so I have read everything in this genre and can say, professionally and personally, that this is the finest example of the genre I have read - for teens or adults - and that is saying a lot!  Just absolutely beautiful!
1430300612|5.0|I am an (undergraduate/graduate student) taking a course in Clinical Neuropsychology. We read this book as well as a textbook chapter on the organization and function of the brain. The reason Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor's book is so informative is because Dr. Taylor has managed to incorporate her academia of neuroanatomy into a riveting first hand account of neuropsychological illness. Dr. Taylor spends a few chapters immersing the readers into the basics of brain anatomy and the centers of the brain which correspond to control of certain behaviors and sensations. The book provides a personal cognitive experience which parallels what our class has learned about brain anatomy and dynamics from our textbook. She provides extreme amounts of neurological detail while maintaining the descriptions coherent enough for the general audience.   What sets this book apart from others like it, in my opinion, is the fact that Dr. Taylor has managed to incorporate various perspectives and nuances in her novel. While it provides striking neurological insight into the cognitive experience accompanying the physical symptoms of stroke, it also gives the reader a new perspective on the functioning of the left versus right hemisphere of the brain. The left hemisphere of the brain controls linear thinking concepts including time, mathematics, sequencing of stimuli and the like. Due to an arteriovenous malformation cerebral hemorrhage, many of Jill Taylor's cognitive systems had shut down due to the inflow of blood to the left hemisphere of her brain. The affected areas included her language production and comprehension centers (Wernick's and Broca's), her ability to process visual and auditory stimuli (sensory cortex), her motor cortex which impaired her movement, and the loss of her ability to process sensory and cognitive experiences in a linear and sequential manner (left hemisphere). In addition, Taylor holds that by silencing the internal thought stream governed by our left hemisphere, one can experience complete loss of self and internal peace, otherwise known as the experience of Nirvana. The struggle described in the novel is both arduous and inspiring, and Taylor's process of recovery is extremely well documented with a whole appendix collection of recommended recovery techniques. While Jill's stroke experience was quite unique and perhaps not fully representative of how everyone might perceive an AVM stroke, the insight her observations offer in this novel as a neurological expert are completely relevant and essential to the healing process. Due to Dr. Taylor's amazing system of support, the plasticity of the brain, and her daily struggles to regain her cognitive abilities she managed to make a full recovery and document it with meticulous accuracy. Dr. Taylor's academic background in neuroanatomy makes this novel fascinating because of the ease with which she was capable of connecting biological neuroanatomy with her own observations to describe the cognitive experience which might have ensued.
0060832819|4.0|In this novel, an unnamed, internationally famous author is left by his wife Esther, suddenly and without explanation. He becomes obsessed with Esther's disappearance: she becomes `the Zahir' and haunts him day and night. (According to information in the novel a Zahir is someone or something which, once we have come into contact with them or it, gradually occupies our every thought, until we can think of nothing else. The word, Zahir, is Arabic).<br /><br />It isn't clear where Esther has gone, nor is it clear why she has left, and the narrator is suspected of playing some role in her disappearance. He wonders whether she has been abducted, or has she abandoned their marriage? And, if she has abandoned their marriage, what is his role in this? Even though the narrator forms other relationships once Esther leaves, he is unable to move beyond her. He may (sometimes) be satisfied, but he is incomplete. Eventually, with the help of Mikhail (one of Esther's friends) the narrator comes to realise that he has to find himself in order to find her.<br /><br />And so, the narrator embarks on his own personal odyssey to find Esther. He learns that she is living in a village in the steppes of Kazakhstan weaving carpets, and teaching French. On his journey from Paris to Kazakhstan the narrator explores various different meanings of love and of life. In this odyssey, the narrator becomes a modern somewhat muted version of Ulysses with different heroic attributes. The original Ulysses's physicality is replaced with a newly found sensitivity. The journey and the outcome may be similar in some ways but the process of arriving at the outcome is very different. Likewise, while there are similarities between Esther and Penelope, Esther has established a life which she can live without the narrator. The differences between the odysseys are as important as the similarities.<br /><br />I liked this novel. I especially liked the way the narrator came to realise what mattered in his life, and why.<br /><br />`We humans have two great problems: the first is knowing when to begin, the second is knowing when to stop.'<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smiths have two great problems: the first is knowing when to begin, the second is knowing when to stop.'

B000JLSM00|4.0|Although John Ford's film the Searchers is considered by many to be a classic,and although it is a good film, I don't think it is the best John Wayne movie ever made. It does not surpass John Wayne's film, the Alamo, in any way, shape or form. I personally think the Searchers is an overrated film in the same way the film High Noon is. It's almost as if people in our society have no original opinions of their own. Classic films in our society should be weighted by their emotional impact, and not by what a critic may say.  And that is the case with both the Searchers and High Noon. Films that I consider to be epics are: the Alamo, Braveheart, the Kingdom of Heaven.
B0045ODPKY|4.0|The story is not brand new, but the execution is outstanding.<br /><br />Chuck Palahniuk (author of \\"Fight Club\\") wrote a book called \\"Pygmy\\" about a group of asian kids trained to be sleeper agents to destroy the U.S. in a devious plot. I highly recommended the book.<br /><br />The Manchurian Candidate was an outstanding movie about a dormant sleeper agent who runs for President, and is \\"awoken\\" at a crucial time in the story.<br /><br />Jolie is excellent as an action actress. She's lost some of the hotness she once had (she just looks too bony now - I liked her curves). But she is a true badass in this film. Maybe a steamy scene would have helped. The film was well executed, and Jolie's character is believable when you allow yourself to suspend your disbelief for some of the action scenes. Some of the plot is predictable too soon, and the \\"shocking\\" reveals were not too surprising compared to \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and \\"The Usual Suspects\\" shocking reveals.<br /><br />Sign me up for the sequel! I predict a trilogy.

B003UESJHY|4.0|One of the best boxing movies I've ever seen is Mark Wahlberg's The Fighter (2010). It's right up there with Cinderella Man (2005), Rocky (1976), Rocky II (1979), and Rocky IV (1985). It may even be the best boxing movie I've ever seen...but only time will tell for sure. Right now, I consider Cinderella Man my favorite. I haven't seen Raging Bull (1980) yet, and while I liked Million Dollar Baby (2004), it just didn't pack the same emotional punch for me as a guy. I give The Fighter 3.5 stars out of 5. Which may seem low to some, but I'm comparing it to every other great movie of all time, not just boxing or sports movies. This is a film that definitely deserves consideration for my Top 200 Movies of all time. So it's rating may go up subsequent viewings.<br /><br />What stands out about The Fighter compared to Cinderella Man and the Rocky films is the photography of the actual boxing scenes. The Fighter used the actual 1980s camera crews from HBO who filmed some of the \\"Irish\\" Micky Ward fights that this film is about. They even used the same cameras from that time period to give the same look and feel to some of the footage of the fights, like you're watching them live almost. It's the combination of that incredible cinematography, the awesome sound effects and music, and the stellar \\"acting\\" by Mark Wahlberg and his opponents that make the fights feel so real. I was literally squirming around in my theater seat during every boxing match in the film. It was just such a visceral presentation that made me feel right there in the ring, ducking punches and feeling battered & bruised.<br /><br />Part of what really lends a realism and emotional depth to the boxing in this film,  is that Wahlberg actually trained as a boxer for 5 years leading up to his role on the film. It took that many years and more to get the film made, and while he was fighting to get this movie produced, he was training so that he didn't just look like he was acting. And it handsomely paid off! The best parts of The Fighter are in the ring. But there's an awful lot to love outside of the ring as well. Christian Bale plays Dicky Eklund, half brother of Micky, a former boxer himself, and Micky's trainer. Dicky is most well known for his fight with Sugar Ray Leonard. But Dicky has fallen into a drug habit that keeps him from being effective as a brother, a boxer, or a trainer. He even winds up in jail for a period of time, where he is finally forced to get clean. That forces Micky to get a new trainer, but Dicky comes back as soon as he gets released. The brotherly bonds prevail after all! Bale plays Dicky very well. I can't say that I really liked the Dicky character, although he redeems himself towards the end of the film. But Bale's performance is definitely worthy of his recent Best Supporting Actor nomination. He inhabits the role like no one else could, like it or not.<br /><br />The real out-of-the-ring punches come in The Fighter from two incredible women: Amy Adams as Micky's girlfriend and Melissa Leo as his mother. Both give unbelievable performances that are probably their best to date. They literally fight with their hands and their words. They've both received Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress in honor of these roles, so they will continue their onscreen \\"fighting\\" offscreen at the Academy Awards later this month. I'm personally cheering for Leo to win since I think her performance just edges out Adams, and her body of work for many years has earned her the recognition in my opinion. In addition to Adams and Leo are a gaggle of Micky's sisters, some of whom are actually played by Micky Ward's real sisters. They definitely add some spice to the mix, and help create some incredibly tense family scenes. Actor Jack McGee really shines as well as Melissa Leo's boyfriend, and Micky's stepfather. The beating he takes both emotionally and physically from Melissa Leo's character is one of the most memorable \\"fight\\" scenes I've seen in awhile!It had me laughing and feeling sorry for him at the same time!<br /><br />Director David O. Russell, mostly known for Three Kings (1999), really had his work cut out for him here. And he rose to the occasion beautifully! The Fighter is not nearly as flashy of a film as Three Kings, but it's got this solid, gritty, cinematic realism and incredible emotional depth to the storytelling that makes it engaging. Whereas Three Kings was more unique in terms of filmmaking style, The Fighter is more classic in its style. But it's very effective. I found the pacing at some points to be a little slow and boring, but overall, the film flowed pretty smoothly. I think Russell did the best that he could with the story he was telling.<br /><br />The cinematography, outside of the ring fights, is adequate. This is probably the area I was most disappointed. The film felt a little too gritty, grainy, and gray for my taste. Granted, it's also the 1980's and the feel of the area where the story takes place, so I think the filmmakers chose to lend it that very realistic look and feel. Still, I like to say great camera work, and that just didn't happen in this film for me. I'd be willing to say that it could have just been the theatrical presentation itself. I've noticed some of the theaters have some crappy projectors sometimes. I'll be curious to see if I feel the same way when I watch the film again on Blu-ray at home.<br /><br />The production design on the film is perfectly suited to the story, but like the cinematography, it didn't really stand out for me on a purely artistic level. While the music score by Michael Brook was a bit weak and could've been stronger, the rock songs used throughout the film really worked well, especially the song \\"How You Like Me Now\\" by The Heavy. That song is definitely now the song I hear when I think of The Fighter. It's permanently etched into my brain with this film, and it really works in the movie to build-up energy for a fight.<br /><br />There's a lot to like with The Fighter. I didn't really have any expectations going into the theater for this film. In fact, I was expecting to be less satisfying based on some critics' reviews. But I'm very glad I saw this film in the theater, because that big screen presentation with the loud sound system really helped this film knock me out. If I were you, I'd catch in the theater if you can, but I'm sure it will play well at home as well.eeling sorry for him at the same time!    Director David O.

I could certainly tell that my 7th gen iPod classic wasn't driving my headphones enough to my liking, so I finally decided to try what appeared to be the best headphone amp in the meager, twenty dollar price range.  I was highly impressed with nearly every aspect of this amp.  The body of sound created by my Grado SR-80's was full and lively.  And to think that this was possible all with the aid of a small, rechargeable piece of metal.  Unlike a few other reviewers, I experienced no excess noise or fuzz.  Long review short, you won't have much to lose if you try this.

3832793836|2.0|How unfortunate that these world-class photos are presented in totally the wrong editorial format and more so because the solution would have been simple: a landscape shaped book.<br /><br />The 448 pages are printed on a reasonable matt art paper and this makes it a quite chunky book so that it cannot be opened without the pages curving into the gutter.  The problems start with so many photos a spread wide with any centrally framed detail merging into the spine and basically destroying the photo. A landscape shaped page would avoid all the spread photos from having their centers ruined and allow for a margin round each as well.<br /><br />Another problem is that most of the photos bleed off the page, which eliminates page numbers.  To get round this, every so often, a photo has generous margins allowing for some numbers.  The back of the book has nine pages of thumbnails and page numbers for every page even though throughout the bleed pages there are no numbers.<br /><br />As to the photos, there are many classics here that are frequently shown whenever Erwitt is mentioned in print.  The wonderful one of a mother looking lovingly at her baby on a bed (1953) that was in the Family of Man exhibition, the landscape shot of the a car racing a steam train in Wyoming 1954, two New York dogs, one huge and the other tiny and their owner's legs from 1974.  There are several fun shots like the art class with the painters in the nude and the model fully clothed.  There is another editorial problem here because as far as I can see the 343 photos are shown in no order.  Surely, a book like this would do them in date order or themes: dogs (one of Erwitt's favorites) countries and cities; humor; children; New York; portraits etcetera.<br /><br />The publishers have several Erwitt books in print and it looks like they all have the same editorial problems I've mentioned.  This is so unfortunate because his work is part of the history of photography over several decades and their creativity would really have come across if more thought had been given to their presentation.
0143038419|1.0|I'm quite shocked this book gets so many good reviews. I could barely finish it (I only did because have a hard time putting a book down after starting, and because I kept thinking that it might get better.) The author writes about her experiences while traveling, but amazingly stays so focused on herself that she discloses very little about the culture and places she goes. She can't stop talking about men, starting with her husband and ending with the man she's dating (she at least admits this is a problem), and while even this could be overlooked (relationships are important in life, after all), it is done in a way that is simply uninteresting and self-centered. It is particularly bad when she is in India, where I'm not certain she ever even looked outside the walls of the compound she stayed in!   If you want to be truly spiritual, don't sit around thinking, \\"God loves me, he'll always take care of me...\\" and crying yourself to sleep at night, but take a look at the world and think about how to make it a better place! Or at least make some real observations about what is going on and how it might be made better. While the author does do an act of charity near the end of the book, even this she does poorly and is dramatized in Hollywood-type style.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|To the people who liked this movie and are now calling it a M. Knight Shamalamadingdong come back...stop.  He didn't direct it, and that's an insult to John Erick and Drew Dowdle, who actually did direct it.  M. Knight get's billing for the \\"story\\" and he produced it.  If you're not sure what the difference is between a director and producer?  Google is your best friend.  On to the review...    Devil is the story of a \\"Devil's Meeting\\" that takes place in a highrise in the city.  The \\"Devil's Meeting\\" is an old wive's tale that starts with a suicide and ends with the devil coming in human form to claim souls of wicked/evil people.  The entire plot and set up of the movie are done with a voice over in the beginning and then a quick introduction to the \\"good guys\\" and a brief, omonious flash of the people soon to be trapped in the elevator.    ===SOME MIGHT CONSIDER THIS PART A SPOILER==  Five people, 2 women and 3 men, all who have shady past (the devil only comes for evil people afterall) are trapped in an elevator.  All seem suspicious, rude or crude in some way, and we are led to believe that ONE of these people is the devil in the flesh.  We get to watch as the passengers in the elevator all become suspicious of each other as odd things start to happen when the lights go out.  Outside the elevator the cops, fire dept and security guards rush around the building trying to figure out why people keep dying inside the elevator and which passenger would have motive to kill these supposed strangers they're trapped with.   ===================================================    Surprisingly, I was entertained.  I went in with VERY low expectations because M. Knight was associated with the movie and I'd just watched his latest failure, Avatar: The Last Airbender, so that may be why I enjoyed it as much as I did.  I wasn't bored, I wasn't disappointed when the ending came.  So that in my book was worth the $ to rent it.  The plot isn't complicated and yes, even though it seemed obvious who the devil in diguise was (in fact my 57yr old mom called it within the first 10mins after the characters were trapped in the elevator), it still held my attention.  The mythology was weak, afterall it's only an old wive's tale.  The acting was pretty good, it was fast paced so it didn't really call for anything grandiose.  The fear and tension portrayed by the different characters was believeable enough, and the end gave a nice little wink to M. Knight with a TWIST.  Albeit the TWIST was somewhat obvious if you were looking for one.    All in all, it was enjoyable.  I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a HORROR movie though. Maybe a supernatural suspense thriller?  While there are some scenes with blood and death they're SUPER tame compared to movies like Saw and Hostel.  And even the monster (in this case the devil) wasn't scary at all.  I was more drawn into the story and the creepiness of being trapped in a small space with strangers and being picked off, one by one.  While not terrifying...it was enough to keep my attention.  And as a capper there did seem to be an actual MESSAGE to the movie.  It wasn't just a scary movie for the sake of being a scary movie (albeit it wasn't all that scary) - it was more like a slightly more bloody and flashy Aesop's Fable.    Solid 4 out of 5 stars since I was entertained and am willing to watch it again.
B003EV6DBM|3.0|The title of my review pretty much says it all.  I could not hear what was being said much of the time due to the relentless, blaring background music.  This is an ongoing problem in many movies today (although it is far more common in Hollywood than most things from the UK).  I think the days when music was used to accent what is going on or provide dramatic cues is rapidly becoming a thing of the past.    It's a shame, as I thought this latest Doctor Who incarnation was pretty good otherwise.  However, the music pretty much took me right out of the whole thing.
0061673730|3.0|I had heard a lot about this book and finally had a chance to read it.  Definitely not what I thought it would be; really, with several philosophy classes under my belt from a long-passed undergrad, I found it to be annoyingly extended and rambling.  The Kubric-esque twist the narrator reveals may have been cutting-edge reading in the mid-70s, but has been done many, many times since.  As a bit of a classical-leaning individual myself, as well as being a motorcyle rider, I found the technical deficiencies to be distracting.<br />I would not recommend this book to someone wanting to learn about Zen, Buddhism, or even basic gestalt psychology.  But if you have a general interest in basic philosophy, especially that of romanticism vs rationalism, then definitely give this a read.
B001QTXM5Y|3.0|Great movie, but I am very disappointed that the digital copy feature expired last year (Jul 2010)  I'd love to have had access to it for my Ipod.
159562015X|4.0|Although, it was an assignment for a committee, I enjoyed taking the test and reading the book.  Did I find out something new about myself?  Not really!  But it confirmed what I already thought I knew.  We are hot wired a certain way, rather than try to be what we aren't, it's much better to build on what we are. This book might make it easier to get along with someone who sees things differently or from another perspective.
B0042816YK|3.0|Julia Roberts is a great actress and a beautiful woman. In this movie she acted well and was beautiful but the movie as a whole was not that good. The movie lacked depth and a compelling storyline. It was not entertaining and overly boring and drawn out. On a positive note it was visually stunning at times and the camera work in Bali was outstanding.
0061733199|5.0|I've read MANY survival books, and this is by far one of the best.  It's very similar to the official US Army publication on survival, with a few differences.  This book is a bit thinner, but has more practical applications and details.  The illistrations are amazing.  I've picked up survival books at stores, thumbed through them, and put them back on the shelf due to a lack of illustrations.  How can you know how to make a shelter, trap, etc., without seeing it?  Well, this book makes it very easy to understand with simple written instructions alongside illustrations.
0312360258|3.0|When I started it was interesting but it got kind of boring. I think I have to get used to the writer's style. It seems she is trying too hard to be \\"hip\\" and humorous and it's not funny or amusing it's actually uhm annoying..Anyway, towards the end it picked up and turned out to be pretty good.
B00005V9IL|5.0|The Abyss is a very long movie being only ten minutes short of three hours, being the special edition of the film.  but it is all worth it.  for being a older film the graphic design of the aliens and their city/ mother ship is great.  The effects rival some of cgi effects used in so many movies today.  I will not go into much story plot detail because if you have seen this movie you know what it is about.      BUY THE SPECIAL EDITION OF THE ABYSS YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.    THE ONLY THING I WISH IS THAT THIS MOVIE WOULD BE RELEASED ON BLU RAY.  IT WOULD BE GREAT ON BLU RAY.  HOPEFULLY ONE DAY IT WILL BE RELEASESED ON BLU.
0451228375|2.0|I've been a fan of Ken Follett for many years and thoroughly enjoyed Pillars of the Earth.  I was most interested in the sequel, takes place 200 years after Pillars of the Earth and is in Kingsbridge.  The characters are descendants of those in Pillars and Follett makes it easy to remember who is who.    But I must say I was disappointed.  I don't really know what I expected but reading the same things that happened in Pillars wasn't it.  I read Pillars and hated to put it down for any reason.  I find I can put World Without End down and not be in a big hurry to pick it back up again.  I will finish the book but I doubt very much that I'll recommend it to anyone because it seems to me to be a rehash of Pillars.  If he had waited until some more significant event to update the descendants, I might have enjoyed the sequel more.  The prior was nasty, the women were still raped and nothing happened to the men who raped them, the church was all powerful ... when did things seem to change for the better?  What would happen then?  That I'd read with pleasure, but it seems to me that World Without End was a rewrite of Pillars of the Earth with different names to the people.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Great quality product, fits very comfortably and the sound is amazing.  The best corded headset I have ever used.  You will not be disappointed in this product.
078322947X|3.0|I've been a fan of this movie since I saw it in the theatres back in 1977.  It would be many, many years later before I could watch it again -- this time on DVD in 4:3 aspect ratio.  But it really didn't diminish the experience for me.  The lack of a widescreen presentation was disappointing but you get over that about 5 minutes into the film.<br /><br />Was delighted to learn in 2013 of the upcoming film restoration and eventual Blu-ray release, and I picked it up the day the Blu-ray came out.  Almost immediately it was unsettling to watch.<br /><br />Whoever did the color enhancement went WAY overboard with the greens.  The grass, plants, tree leaves, etc are so vibrantly green that they practically glow.  It is very distracting.  In some cases the \\"greening effect\\" bleeds into other things in the shot and you can detect a slight green hue in things that shouldn't have one.<br /><br />I've watched this DVD on two separate players and on two separate hi-def televisions but the effect is the same.  In their attempt to brighten up the colors they went a bit overboard for my tastes.<br /><br />The setting and story in \\"Sorcerer\\" is meant to be a bit gritty and dirty.  I think it works better when it doesn't look like Ted Turner colorized it.<br /><br />I'm glad I got to see it in widescreen again.  But for future viewings I'll go back to my DVD copy that is a little grainier and less brightly colored.  For me that version just looks right.<br /><br />For the record, here's my initial review from several years ago that I had to delete in order to add the updates above:<br /><br />\\"Sorcerer\\" had the misfortune of being released in the theaters around the same time as \\"Star Wars\\". Woe unto any other film that hoped to find any real press attention during that time. I put \\"Sorcerer\\" up there with \\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"The French Connection\\" as one of William Friedkin's best films.<br /><br />Much has already been written about how and why it wasn't a box-office success, so I will dispense with that discussion here. But don't fall into the trap of believing that because a film wasn't a hit that it wasn't any good. If you do that you will miss out on some of the best films ever made.<br /><br />I can remember going to see \\"Star Wars\\" at the theater back in '77 and seeing the trailer for \\"Sorcerer\\" and the poster in the lobby. I remember thinking at the time that \\"Sorcerer\\" looked rather unappealing but only because it was juxtaposed against \\"Star Wars\\". Timing is everything in the movie business.<br /><br />Of particular interest in this film is the scene where Scheider and company attempt to drive trucks laden with unstable nitroglycerin across a dilapidated rope-supported bridge during a rainstorm and in high wind. Everyone who discusses this movie seems to refer to that scene. It's a good one. It's very tense and exciting. I knew how it ended and I was still on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />I'm not thrilled that the DVD release is in 4:3 asect ratio. But after a few minutes one forgets what aspect ratio the film is in and just settles in to enjoy it.<br /><br />The DVD picture is pretty clean and sharp. There are a few bonus features and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />This is an American movie but it has a European feel to it, especially in the first half. By that I mean we watch the events unfold without a lot of exposition or immediate explanation. The thrust of the film doesn't really begin until the midway point.<br /><br />Roy Scheider plays the lead, but Steve McQueen and Nick Nolte were also considered for the role.I will dispense with that discussion here.

0061537969|5.0|I love this book. Heartfelt story which was true to life.  Yes, it was sad at times but it had a happy ending.  Wonderful characters, beautiful writing, unique story teller in Enzo. Thank you, mom for this Christmas gift. It is now being passed around to friends and co-workers. I love you Enzo, and you remind me of my departed beloved dog \\"Kieger\\". Maybe you are not a fictional dog after all???
B0000062GK|1.0|Just some quick info before my main review. I'm a guitarist myself, and I'm always looking for some good instrumental stuff to listen to and learn to play. I like a wide range of music, including rock, metal, blues, and some jazz.   It's a shame being a great guitar player doesn't make you a great composer and writer of guitar music. This album is so horrifically bad, I don't even know where to begin. The guitar rhythms are painfully generic and forgettable, and so heavily processed it sounds more like a techno album at times, than a guitar album.   Satriani needs to take some lessons from some of his students, or some other instrumental guitarists, in how to compose a good melody and actually have some FEEL to a song. If a robot could play guitar, this album is what it would sound like. Complete and absolute lack of feeling, emotion, or any human character. The only song that had any potential was \\"Love Thing\\" but even that got buried under too many guitar effects, much like the rest of the album. He uses so many effects (tremelo, wah, etc) it actually distracts you from what he's playing. It's ridiculous.   It's a shame I can't recommend something better by Satriani, but I've only heard one song of his I've ever liked (Always With Me, Always With you). If you want some great instrumental guitar, check out some of Marty Friedman's work or Richie Blackmoore etc.
B004G600A4|5.0|I have always loved Disney and now my children do. My children were dying to see this movie in the theater and were mesmerized for the entire duration. Now they cannot wait for this movie to come out on DVD and I find I am getting a little impatient as well. This movie was cute and funny. I will not go into a synopsis as you can find this anywhere but I highly recommend kids and youthful adults see this movie.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|i had to say this was a awsome book. it was cool even if u dont believe in these gods it is still a cool book.he stricks again.i still like  percy jackon better even this was a awsome book.he needs to hurry up and write the next one.same with the heroes of olymips.that also was a good book.cant wait till fall!!!! once again awsome book. i think all teens will like this book like i did.
1416594795|5.0|I admit to going into this book already being a fan of Richard Dawkins' writing. The ability to communicate about science or technology in a persuasive and accessible way is altogether too rare, and it's an art that Professor Dawkins has mastered. While he did not have to persuade me to his viewpoint, I found that it strengthened my ability to discuss this matter, as well as my ability to persuade in general. All around, an enjoyable and enlightening read.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This DVD was reasonably priced and has three levels of workouts. I like the way Jillian has assistants demonstrating different ability levels during the workout. The music is awful though, so I just mute the DVD since it's not rocket science to figure out what you are supposed to do. As to hand weights....I recommend starting with 2lb. ones unless you are already doing some other type of physical activity.  I started with 3lb. weights which was a bit more challenging but seeing results quicker! I love that this is a thorough workout that takes less than half an hour - the workouts are actually more like 25 minutes, and not 20 minutes.     Technical issues with the DVD are: you cannot fast forward to the workouts!  Every time you put the DVD in it has to run through all the garbage at the beginning and it's impossible to get to the menu.  At first I thought it might be our DVD player but it did this on all our DVD players, whereas other DVDs did not have this problem.  So I'm thinking low budget and may have to accommodate this annoying issue in other ways. This is the only reason I didn't give this workout DVD five stars.
B000A5044C|5.0|Set in modern day Tokyo, the movie follows the life of four brothers and sisters in a dismembered family. The father left a long time ago, the mother is an immature woman who is looking for self-fulfillment, no matter what the (family) cost. Without ever knowing what she really does for a living, the audience is led to face and (hopefully) bear her repetitive, largely unjustified and lengthy leaves from home, leaving her kids behind under the supervision of her oldest, teenage son. One day however, she fails to return and the kids are left alone with a handful of bank notes... and nobody to rely on.<br /><br />The movie follows a linear, chronological timeline, the shooting is clean and efficient, actors are top notch: the lead character, Yagira Yuuya, was actually crowned Best Male Actor at the 2004 Cannes ! Youngest ever!<br /><br />A special attention was brought by the director to accurately depicting feelings rather than thoughts in a brilliant attempt to stick to how kids actually live. As a result, the movie is more factual than anything else. Therefore, expect no judgment whatsoever on the mother: it's up to the audience to decide whether to hate or forgive her.<br /><br />Although it quickly becomes clear that a drama is unfolding, the audience is left in awe by the kids' resilience and extraordinary will to survive, building optimism. They simply never, ever give up! Makes grown-ups wonder: would I be able to do the same in their situation? There is nothing to throw away in this movie. Truly a most recommended piece of 7th art production.  What's more, the story's actually based on true facts...
0007294662|5.0|I like the title `Information is Beautiful'best because it says clearly what I love about this book. McCandless has transformed information in the form of number data into beautiful graphics. The information can become instantly more powerful by many orders. (I say can because not all the graphics are equally powerful).<br />There is a wonderful almost recursive aspect to this work- the world we perceive is shaped by `invisible' streams of stuff that can be converted to data and analysed. The abstractive power of numerical analysis allows us to discover lots of exciting new information about the world, but for so many people in the world, numbers and even graphs are a foreign language. Even for those of us who can `speak' numbers will not (cannot!) always put in the effort to work through every set of numbers we come across.<br />What McCandless has succeeded in doing is taking some of the analysis that has gone on (and one can quibble with that analysis behind some graphics, but that is not really the point) and translating it back into the way we like to perceive the world - visually - so that we instantly see the abstractive power of that analysis, most of it really engagingly set out in colors and forms that are clear and bright.<br />An example of this power is the graphic called `Life Times; how will you spend your 77.8 years?'.(See user images) I was already really familiar with the statistics of the time the average person spends watching television but when I SAW the relative size of that circle, I stopped watching television that same day and have hardly watched since.<br />The choice of information that this book works through also functions as a fascinating insight into the author working to make sense of the world he lives in.<br />The cases where the graphics do not work very well are where the information has not been truly `translated' from numbers to visuals; rather picture icons have been stuck onto standard graphs.
B000002HMH|4.0|When i originally heard this album from Metallica back in 96 as a kid, I originally didn't like it too much however it has grown on me slowly throughout the years especially as i began to get a little older and today, I find this album to be Metallica's most misunderstood and overlooked release. While it is true that this is where the members of Metallica originally shaved their hair [Them pictures in the booklet of this album look very un-metal!!] and this is where Metallica started doing unexpected things like performing at festivals like Lollapalooza, Metallica made an album that i think is actually superior to the black album and for one thing, The singles from this album are not played half to death on the radio [which is a good thing]. Moving even further away from their thrash/speed metal roots, Metallica creates an album that is mainly rooted in hard rock with some blues influences but that doesn't stop some of the songs from rocking. The highlights here are Until It Sleeps, Cure, Hero Of The Day [Best song on the album], Poor Twisted Me, Ain't My B*tch, and The House Jack Built. The most obviously different and unexpected song of the bunch Mama Said [which is pretty much a country-rock song!] is alright but would've been FAR better and more powerful had it been all acoustic the way that James Hetfield performed it live in the late-90's. All in all, an underrated album that unfortunately will not appeal much to Metallica fans who like their earlier classics from the 80's. But, If you can accept the fact that this is gonna be a different sound coming from Metallica, Then you should find yourself enjoying this album for the most part. Before you believe the criticism from fans and critics about this album, find out for yourself whether that criticism is truly justified or not.
B00006AW2L|5.0|Like all their early albums from the sixties, this album too had its classics, and here Brian Jones would add a sitar to \\"Paint it Black,\\" another classic of the sixties. Then, of course, \\"Stupid Girl,\\" and \\"Lady Jane,\\" with its allusions to drug use. Like their other albums of the sixties, this one is a must buy.
B00000FCBC|4.0|This double disc covers release from Metallica couldn've come at a better time in their career than the late-90's. Metallica covers a wide variety of bands from The Misfits to Thin Lizzy to even Queen!!!! Disc 1 contains then-new recordings of covers while Disc 2 [The real treat] contains older recordings of covers which includes the classic EP Garage Days Re-visited in its entirety!! Compared to Reload, Disc 1 is certainly not too bad as there are some pretty good covers like Sabbra Cadabra, Die Die My Darling, and It's Electric but it's Disc 2 that steals the show here and makes this collection a definite keeper. Disc 2 has just about no filler from beginning to end and is a good example of how great Metallica can be even when they're performing other band's songs! Had Disc 2 been the only disc of this collection, This would've easily been a 5 star collection. The best songs are Helpless, The Wait [My favorite song on here], Last Caress/Green Hell, Stone Cold Crazy, Overkill, and So What. The best thing about this collection is that it will eventually make you wanna hear the original versions to these songs out of curiosity to see how the original bands performed these songs as i discovered The Misfits, Thin Lizzy, Motorhead, and several other bands off of this release. This is definitely reccomended however due to the unreasonably high price tag this collection carries [It's a double album], Try to order one used instead. Also, Share these discs with today's so-called rock and metal fans as it can enlighten them to some good bands from the past.
B00006AW2S|5.0|Considered by many to be their best single of the sixties, \\"Satisfaction\\" had risque lyrics and a catchy riff. \\"The Last Time,\\" \\"Play With Fire,\\" and \\"The Spider and the Fly\\" would all go on to become hits. Definitely an album to get you out of your head.
B000002H97|3.0|It was with this album that Metallica finally became worldwide superstars for the first time after years of dominating the underground metal scene. And as expected, Things have changed a little. Gone are the 8 and 9 minute songs, Gone are the extended instrumentals, And gone are the thrashy sounds that've shaped all of the previous four Metallica albums. Instead, Metallica opts for a more classic metal/hard rock sound as opposed to their earlier efforts. Alot of Metallica fans tend to have some negative feelings toward this album [and just about every album that followed] as many feel that this is the album where Metallica initially sold out and left their thrash/speed metal roots behind and while i believe that this album is not better than any of the albums that Metallica released during the 80's, It's still a pretty listenable album at the end of the day despite there being some skippable material. Courtesy of producer Bob Rock [Who would produce the next three Metallica albums], Metallica has a more polished sound that's less rugged so you will be dissapointed if you're expecting the epic metalfests of the previous four albums. Other than the still overplayed singles [You should know what songs they are by now] from this album there are a few great songs on this album like My Friend Of Misery, Don't Tread On Me [which has a very catchy blues-like sound], and The God That Failed. Enter Sandman, Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, and yes even the infamous ballad Nothing Else Matters are all good songs in reality however if you've spent anytime listening to any rock station chances are you've already heard all these songs to death for the last 20 years which does play a significant role in me not really listening to this album too much these days since outside of the singles, not much of the rest of this album is too good. While short on moments of greatness, This is a listenable but overrated [and/or underrated] album from Metallica.
B00006AW2O|5.0|The Rolling Stones always tended more toward the bluesy side, as opposed to The Beatles. While The Beatles sang of Good Day Sunshine, The Stones were Confessing The Blues. This, along with all their sixties albums, show the true core of The Rolling Stones's sound. A must have.
B000002H6C|5.0|While the previous album Master Of Puppets is almost universally accepted as the best Metallica album, I think that And Justice For All deserves that title. After the death of their former bassist Cliff Burton 2 years earlier, Metallica hired then-newcomer Jason Newsted as Cliff's replacement and they went to work on what would be 1 of the biggest albums of their career. With the release of this album, Metallica finally broke through to the mainstream metal audience [with help from their classic video for One] and they finally began to gain some popularity above the underground. One common complaint of this particular album is that the songs have gotten too long but i certainly disagree!!!! There is NEVER a dull moment on this entire album and Metallica rocked out like never before on this album. One, this album's best known song, never gets old and has earned its status as a metal classic. Other highlights include The Shortest Straw, Dyers Eve, Eye Of The Beholder, and To Live Is To Die [Another great instrumental]. This breakthrough album is a definite metal classic and to me is the highlight of Metallica's career and i think that this album along with Ride The Lightning and Master Of Puppets should be the albums that Metallica are remembered for.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Now that I've finished \\"World Without End\\" and before that, \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", I'm beginning to see that Ken Follett is my kind of writer. His prose is straightforward and clear. His characters are brought to life in such a way that you are interested in what happens to them. The stories are good and solid.    \\"World Without End\\" continues that tradition. Even the villians are shown to be complete characters, confused about why everyone hates them and seemingly perfectly justified in their own actions. The heroes are flawed people just like all of us, and even as they grow and learn, they remain true to themselves. The environment of the 14th century is realistic and presented in such a way that you learn about that period while it all feels perfectly normal.     It continues the basic setting of \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and is a sequel in that respect, but reading Pillars is not a requirement. The priory of Kingsbridge continues to try to exert its influence over the town, even as the merchants get more and more powerful.The effects of the plague keeps everyone adapting and adjusting as they try to settle into a changing world.    Strongly recommended. Follett says another sequel is planned for the future, and I look forward to it.
B000002HRE|2.0|Seeing as how Load has grown on me a lot through the years i thought that this follow-up would do the same but to this day it has not. Just like Load, Metallica are pretty much done with the thrash metal sound and have moved on to a more hard rock sound. Unlike Load, I find much of this album to be a bore. While the first single and opening track Fuel is a pretty good song, This album soon descends into mediocrity for much of the rest of the album. Outside of Fuel, Devil's Dance, Better Than You [The best song of the album], and maybe The Memory Remains there's not really anything else here that's interesting. The production is more polished than ever and while the band sounds energetic throughout as usual, You really can't help but have a hard time sitting through this album in its entirety. Of course, The extreme Metallica fans will own this album regardless whether or not they like it but everybody else can feel free to skip this one and check out the underrated Load instead or even better yet, Buy any of their pre-black album material.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Tenía originalmente un Phenom II 955 Black edition y he migrado a este micro, la verdad es toda una belleza de rendimiento, aprovechando en descuento del gold box me ha a precio más que apetecible, estoy completamente satisfecho de haberlo comprado. Altamente recomendado si no quieres gastar una fortuna para armar una pc que hace años no te hubieras podido imaginar.
B000002H33|5.0|By the time of this third album, Metallica was already a household name in the american underground metal scene. But, it was with this album that Metallica began to really become a force to be reckoned with. Metallica not only created a thrash metal classic here but they've created an all-time classic album that everybody regardless of musical preference deserves to hear in its entirety at least once!!! From start to finish, There is absolutely no skippable material as every single song is great and once the guitars hit on Battery your immediate first instinct is to headbang with reckless abandon!!!!! Hetfield and company are in top form here and this is definitely Metallica at their prime. Every single song on this album is classic but the must-hear songs are Orion [A captivating 8 minute plus instrumental that MUST be heard to be believed], the classic title track, Leper Messiah, and Damage Inc. If you're new to Metallica, Ignore all of their later albums and start here with this one [you will be glad you did]. And, IF ANYBODY claims they're a Metallica fan but yet they hate this album, They do not really like Metallica seeing as this is easily 1 of Metallica's finest hours. This album is simply essential for anybody who likes music, period. Sadly, This would be the final album to feature bassist Cliff Burton as he would die in a tour bus accident during the tour that Metallica went on to support this album.
1848566190|5.0|Movie buffs are likely familiar with the works of Drew Struzan, as are many casual fans of cinema even if they don't know his name. With an incredible knack for producing detailed, dead-on portraits of a film's actors and capturing the sense of excitement and grandiosity of cinema, he has illustrated and painted some of Hollywood's most famous movie posters. A frequent collaborator of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, he was the official illustrator of posters for the Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Back to the Future film series.       The Art of Drew Struzan chronicles much of his work, beginning with Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981 to his retirement in 2008 and the final, unused image he produced for Hellboy II: The Golden Army at the request of his friend Guillermo del Toro. In between are selected works from an extensive portfolio of images now part of the canon of some of America's most celebrated films. Struzan shares the illustrations produced for Blade Runner: The Final Cut and the anniversary release of The Shawshank Redemption, and offers up interesting glimpses of comp work that was never fully developed into a final form, like his work for the 1992 theatrical version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.     Writing with David J. Schow, Struzan provides a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at designing movie posters by assembling collections of comp artwork (basically the rough drafts) that would eventually lead to the final images. It's a great chance to see the ideas Struzan worked with as he built towards many of his now famous works. It's also intriguing to see the images that could, or should, have been, but for various reasons never quite congealed. Throughout the book Struzan speaks briefly of the commissioned work, the changes that were requested, and how the ideas were formed, shared, and collaborated upon with the filmmakers in order to develop the art that would come to represent and identify the movie itself.     Created with an irreplaceable style and a strong sense of composition his painted illustrations drew in movie-watchers and created a sense of connection between the film and its viewers. By creatively employing the use of direct gaze, filmgoers took part in the experience of a film's world directly, establishing a personal connection with the impeccable portraits of Harry Potter and Indiana Jones, who met their viewer's gaze and invited them into their worlds. His paintings created a cohesive story representative of the movie, showcasing the sense of adventure and excitement of an Indiana Jones movie with perfection, the macho, clueless buffoonery of Big Trouble in Little China's Jack Burton, and the epic space operatics of Star Wars.     As enjoyable as it is to share in the visions of Struzan, it is also a bittersweet journey as it highlights the death of the relationship between Hollywood and illustrative art in the marketing of a film. As the years rolled on and technology progressed, movie studio execs learned how much easier, cheaper, and brainless it was to create a movie poster from publicity stills and promo images in Photoshop. It truly is a shame, and since Struzan's retirement in 2008 there has been a noticeable lack of creative, artistic imagery prior to a film's release. Gone are the days of a collective tingling of spines amongst cinemaphiles when the official poster of a long-awaited film was unveiled, as occurred on March 11, 1999 for Star Wars: Episode I when Struzan's image was introduced as the worldwide promotional piece for George Lucas's widely awaited continuation of the Skywalker saga.     Over the last decade, the spectacle of movie posters has eroded into simplistic images of generic backdrops populated with floating heads staring off into the distance, severing the relationship between the film and its viewers almost immediately. The grandiosity of cinema, the sense of excitement and fun, have been relegated to budget lines. Illustrations that were once sought after by Hollywood's biggest directors were now being scuttled by studio executives who no longer saw the appeal, who simply viewed movies as nothing more than a bottom line in their operating budget, or worse yet, just didn't get it. When asked by a reporter why Struzan's commissioned poster wasn't used for Pan's Labyrinth, a studio representative said, \\"We didn't use it because it looks too much like art.\\"     Struzan's greatest gift, of course, was that he was able to marry the artistic merits of film and painted illustration. Having produced some of the finest images for many of Hollywood's most enjoyable fare, Struzan now offers fans a look at his creative process and showcases the work he is most fond of. Seeing his work collected in The Art of Drew Struzan one is instantly reminded of the glory of film and the emotional and cultural investments we've made in particular favorites. For more than 30 years, his posters have brought to life all the drama, adventure, humor and camaraderie of the movie itself, rising far above a simple marketing gimmick and into the realm of art. They were, and are to this day, a celebration of cinema at its best.    -- Michael Hicks
B000002LCB|5.0|Loved the score for The Princess Bride; it complemented the film perfectly.  Even if you're not a fan of the score, the disc is a must have for the song 'Storybook Love'.  Classic!
B003JSSPSY|5.0|If you thought the first one was good, the second one is better. I was not expecting much, but I was very delighted to find it better.  Infact I'd have to say this is one of the only series out there I had to watch all the way through so fast... and not wait... let it linger, nope, had to see it all!!!
B003J27WFW|5.0|Like the title states, this is an awesome, awesome DVD of RUSH.  My beloved wife bought it for me for Christmas and we have watched it more than once since Christmas
0060935464|5.0|I knew I loved this book when I read it back in school. But I had forgotten the exact story and the fabulous way Harper Lee approached the incidents in this typical Alabama town.  Ms. Harper's writing style is just so welcoming, so easy that you feel a part of Scout's family as soon as she begins to talk.  We should all make a point to read this every couple of years to remind ourselves of how far we have come in the issue of prejudice - and how far we have left to go. We should also read this again and again just to expose ourselves to the quality of storytelling of this book which is found so seldom in today's literature.  An excellent book!
B003Q6D27S|5.0|Wow, what can I say. I absolutely loved all 7 'Saw' films; from the characters, storyline, traps, gore, and the shocking twists. Such clever writing. I'm surprised a lot of people dislike these films (of course you have to be into the horror genre to watch them in the first place). The gore looks so real it's bone-chilling. Makes you imagine yourself in the victims' places and wonder if you could past their tests (-shudder-). What amazes me most is the collaborative effort that went into making all 7 films work (writing, directing, acting, visual effects, etc). I'm sad to see this franchise end... (although hoping they make another!) It's fun to watch the movies in a marathon because it makes it easier to pick up on all the details. I'm a 24 year old female, so the 'Saw' franchise is for anyone who appreciates the things mentioned above.
B0042JH05I|1.0|As a Detroiter, and a musician/engineer/producer, I can tell you that this is a   beautiful video that is ABSOLUTELY DEVOID OF ITS MUSICAL SOUL!    This is no diss on the performers, who are brilliant and giving it their all, but   rather this is a HUGE indictment of the audio mix, which is absolutely HORRIBLE!    The ESSENCE of Motown is the rhythm section interplay, but you can barely hear  Eddie Willis and Ray Monette playing the Motown signature guitar parts!  A Motown song with out a backbeat guitar? UNTHINKABLE!    Phil is SO loud in the mix, there's no room for the background singers,   who are FABULOUS talents, or the horns who are trying their best!    PLEASE - Remix and remaster this disc - with all of the quality and fidelity available on Blu-ray,  this disc is only halfway there - visually great, but sonically WAY BELOW PAR!
0071752854|5.0|As an engineer and economist at heart, I'm skeptical of this type of book.  I've read a bunch and they never actually helped me.  In most cases, I had a hard time imagining them helping anyone.  The advice wasn't specific and actionable.  Pitch Anything is different.  It gives you a method and colorful, engaging examples of that method in action.  It's good enough that I've verbally explained the theory to fellow engineering types before a big pitch and it helped them.  Then they begged to borrow my review copy of the book.
B003UERZ88|4.0|I love Rob Halford. I mean, not physically, although maybe. No, no, what I mean is I think he has one of the most incredible voices in rock history, and his image was so cool for so long (don't much care for that bushy goatee he's had the past few years). I was very excited for a new record that wasn't Christmas music, but it's not on par with something like Crucible, easily one of the best outputs of Rob's career. The music is alright, with some good tunes, but the lyrics are really hit and miss. It almost seems as if they were written to get played in arenas and stadiums. Am I really listening to songs about boxing and NASCAR? I will admit, though, the song about the Torero was an interesting tale. Anyway, it's not a particularly memorable album, but there's enough going for it to make it worthwhile. Plus, it's Rob Halford. Anything new from Rob is welcome.
1843106698|5.0|Read this before setting up any appointment with any psychotherapist.  I am glad I did.  This covers all aspects; physical, emotional, psychological, social, clinical, diagnostic criteria, and more.  Plus, it is easy to read and not full of Latin terms that only medical professionals know.  This will help you decide if any clinical appointment making is even necessary or useful.  I am having second thoughts about doing so myself even though the book convinced me that I am indeed AS.    Mr. Joel M. Wilson
B0044E9LW6|5.0|Any Dio fan should pick this up. No, I don't mean illegally download it (or even legally download it), I mean you should buy the actual compact discs and put them in your CD player and listen to them and be like, \\"thanks internet stranger, this was a good idea.\\" Besides the great songs from the heyday of heavy metal, you also get some Monsters of Rock replica backstage passes, which is a nice bonus. Dio's voice really shines, and you get to hear two classic Dio line-ups supporting the master on the biggest of stages. So, fans, friends, enjoy this quality collection.
B0015DROBO|4.0|These aren't the best books I've ever read, by far.  But Steig Larsson did one amazing thing.  He created a character that I really rooted for.  I wanted to know what happened to her.  So, I read all three books.  Admittedly, I skimmed a few parts.  But, I also did that with the unabridged Le Miserables (how many pages does it take to describe a garden?), which is my favorite book.  So, if the character of Lisbeth grabs you...read them all.  But in paperback...borrow them from the library.  They're really not worth full price.

B0031SCV46|5.0|There are a number of features I looked at when purchasing my first midi controller. Price,proformance,quality,Ease of use,and portability were among my top concerns. Every product in the 150-ish range was throughly reviewed by user feedbacks, you videos and even in some cases going to my local music store. (for some models) Possibly the best thing about this is the DAW (Digital audio workstation) direct link interfaces. This saves alot of time and movement. I run windows 7 64bit, I installed the drivers from the M-Audio website first then plugged it in after a restart. It has worked well.      EDIT: I originally gave this a 4 star. I have been using it for about 6 months and can easily say it deserves 5. This board has been fantastic to me and is one of my favorite instruments in my arsenal now. The keys still feeel nice, they don't: spring back, or very slowly come up. It's perfect and has proven to blow the other brands in it's price range away. Buy with confidence in the product.
B001F12J0C|5.0|This is perhaps the second best trilogy in all of movie land. Jason Bourne (Born homonym) is an assassin who has developed amnesia. He attempts to find out who he is while fighting off people trying to kill him. Eventually he will discover he doesn't like who he is. While he has forgotten who he is, he does remember how to stunt drive a car, shoot all kinds of weapons and knows a heap about technology and is perhaps the only fictional non-super hero who could whoop Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. He is Rambo with an IQ. And like all fictional heroes he is the only person in the world who can kill with one shot, while no one else can shoot straight.<br /><br />What is nice about the trilogy is that the movies mesh very well and get better as they go along. Like LOTR it has one climax scene after another. This is a thinking man's action-drama.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I know many people claim that the album they are reviewing happens to be their favorite album by that artist. I've written reviews before, but this truly IS my favorite release from Madonna.    No Human being has ever seen the true meaning of socialism or communism, nor has anything close been attempted. Neither can be \\"attempted\\" as its a slow natural psychological growth of society. Madonna portrays herself as a \\"Marxist\\" and reflects on her growing up in the United States, the heart of global Capitalism. To those who spend forever studying this philosophy, you can hear the lyrics and know EXACTLY what she is referencing. To the average listener, the meanings of certain songs will never penetrate their brain. Perhaps Madonna made a mistake and forgot that many Americans don't have enough wisdom to understand something complex. This album shows how human we must become, less selfish, less narcissistic or else we are going to literally destroy each other.     The song, I'm So Stupid talks about how she is no longer brainwashed by the Capitalist propaganda, and how she used to live in the bubble of illusion. As for the title track, she clearly is using sarcasm to say she has a butler, nanny, bodyguards, as an example to show how greedy and spoiled people can be and still will never be happy. Hollywood is a song of artificial beauty and the average superficial pathology in our current society. Love Profusion was placed in the album as a sweet break from all the serious concepts contained on the record. (I Own this on Vinyl besides Cd) Though I have no source to support this, but I personally feel Love Profusion was about her stance on gay marriage. She wants a \\"Celebration\\" because one should not have to worry about what others think if love is true. The gay marriage debate was circulating the American media at the time of the album's and single's release. Nobody knows me indicates that in society most people lack a true understanding of their identity, let alone a true understanding of each other as human beings. She doesn't listen to the media, she doesn't watch TV, she wants people to know who she is. In our materialistic society people compete against each other for survival leading to incivility. The meaning to the album is so complex, I'd be typing for hours.     Grab this album, you don't have to be a socialist or agree with the philosophy, but Madonna does speak truth when she confronts MAJOR social problems in today's capitalist world.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|People seemed to miss the point about what Erotica was about. Madonna always expresses her feelings about the past and present and if you follow her, you will see the lyrics have a FAR deeper meaning. The concept of the album is how sex can affect a person who is addicted to sex, the aftermath of unwise choices (In This Life was about a friend who was died of Aids during the 80's,) the struggle to understand true love, romance and intimacy,relationships, and sexual abuse. This album is TRULY a piece of art. \\"Bad Girl\\" was a message about herself being unhappy with her own sexual addiction and lack of self-esteem. \\"Waiting\\" was an excellent song and I play this all the time. Clearly she was in love with someone and she has to deal with getting over the person or wait for time to pass and see if her love is reciprocated. The message of this song is powerful because the song represents someone in denial. Rain is a beautiful love song and this song shows how Intimacy remains an important element throughout the album.    Overtime, Madonna was able to confront her demons after years of several mistakes leading to a broken heart numerous times due to a lack of self-worth.
B003L77GRO|3.0|First of all, I think Michael C. Hall is brilliant as Dexter Morgan. The supporting cast is great too but he really makes the show. Season 4 with guest star John Lithgow was tremendous! No wonder he won the Emmy for Outstanding Guest Star in a Drama Series. They worked so well off each other, I couldn't look away.     When I read that Julia Stiles was going to be the Season 5 guest star, I was dubious, to say the least. I don't think she's a strong enough actor to take on the likes of Michael C. Hall. And I knew she would never top John Lithgow. Boy was I right! She played Luman (Spoiler Alert!), an innocent girl kidnapped and tortured by five very creepy guys. Her acting, as the victim, was always over the top. She just tried too damn hard to be damaged. Once she got over that, she was tolerable but still weak. And then they throw them together romantically??? I found myself missing Rita and I almost hoped she would come through the door and tell Dexter it was all a dream! I don't think that Dexter could get over Rita that fast even if he is a sociopath.    I thought that Johnny Lee Miller was way overlooked and under utilized as Jordan Chase, the main bad guy. I would have liked there to be more interaction between Jordan and Dexter. He was much better than Julia Stiles ever could be and I thought he was wasted in his role.     And the writing was sub-par as well. When the cops find the two men in the warehouse and Masuka ties it up like a nice little package, it was totally implausible. But what really pissed me off was the last episode. Debra is inches away from discovering who the killer is and she just walked away???? Debra Morgan is a great cop! She would never in a million years let a perp go just like that! I was so put off by that, I could hardly watch the rest of the episode. Then they go and ruin even more by having Luman leave Dexter to go back home??? Like she never killed two men in cold blood?     Dexter, you deserve better than this!
1600242405|4.0|In his writing, Keith reveals a man with a heart and a brain as well as a universal love and passion for music. It's a wonderful insight into a character that most of us only know from his performances on stage. Unfortunately, the audiobook does a horrible disservice by using a reader bent on making him sound stoned, drunk, high, and..., well..., goofy for most of the book.   Keith reads a short introduction to the audiobook and it's heartbreaking to hear that short segment and compare it to the remaining hours read by an actor. (Johnny Depp does a few chapters in the beginning but simply 'reads' most of the material as opposed to \\"acting\\" through the chapters.)   It was, for me, a sizable chore to finish listening to this book despite the rich and interesting content it contained. If you have a choice, go with the printed book and leave this hammy version on the shelf.

B004BBDHEK|5.0|\\"Live at the Acropolis\\" has been the gold standard and while later compositions including this one, have been good, none have ever reached close to \\"Live at the Acropolis\\". Remember Acroyali and the Mozart-effect, none of that is back. While he has managed to retain most of his talented musicians, they seem to have a decreasing contribution in his compositions (he is going a bit more electronic than acoustic now). I have been to his concert and will always attend whenever he performs live.   In all fairness, this album deserves 4 stars but the fifth star is an appreciation of the fact that he is back to doing what he does best. Legends like him compete only with themselves and with this album, he did not beat himself. Now, we really hope in a couple of years, he will surprise us with an album that surpasses \\"Live at the Acropolis\\"

Not one tear nor bump in the book itself, though the hard-sleeve the book fits into is a bit chipped.<br />The prints are bright and large, and I was able to comfortably read it.<br /><br />The extras included are definitely for the absolutist, including bits of expanded universe writing, and production sketches.<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy with my purchase.
B004HD2ZHC|4.0|\\"What a beautiful death, to die in the exercise of your passion,\\" remarks Philippe Petit in the excellent 2008 documentary Man on Wire. It's a literal statement as well as philosophical - high-wire artist Petit could literally die if he falls off his balancing wire between the World Trade Centers, but it's also a testament to how committed he is to his craft. ...And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead frontman Conrad Keely would probably be the first to agree, so caught up in his own band's mythology and defiant independence that to compromise his own artistic values would probably kill him (most likely accompanied by a full symphony and a choir of wailing female voices). No, Keely has been more than content to steer his own ship, from 2001's noise-rock master thesis Source Tags & Codes through convoluted orchestral messes like 2006's So Divided, losing much of their fanbase and most of the considerable critical cachet ST&C afforded them in the process. He's been content to exercise his own passion, and it's indeed resulted in a sort of commercial death for the band . . . but wow if Keely isn't plunging full speed ahead anyways. Tao of the Dead is a fearless two-part affair, one split into eleven chapters in the key of D and the second a 16-minute epic in five movements and in the key of F and both resolutely proggy in the vein of your favorite Rush or Yes record, if Rush or Yes had had an upbringing in full-throated punk and feedback-drenched indie rock.<br /><br />Keely has stated in interviews that it's this kind of record that he grew up listening to and wanted to emulate, and maybe that's why Tao of the Dead ends up being the most focused Trail of Dead effort in years rather than a space-rock sham. Sure, there's the instrumental opening track, as routine in the Trail of Dead universe as Keely's fantastical album artwork. There are tracks with names like \\"Weight of the Sun (Or, the Post-Modern Prometheus)\\" or \\"Cover the Days Like a Tidal Wave\\" and pointless changes in time signature. There's Keely taking himself way too seriously, whether it's ranting about ferries of the dead or the utter darkness that will consume us all. But whoa how the songs go! \\"Pure Radio Cosplay\\" is one of the best tracks Trail of Dead have put to record in recent memory, and not only do the guitars punch and the melodies soar, all with X-factor Jason Reece's inimitable drumming anchoring things, but it sets a template for the rest of Tao of the Dead to follow. This is important when considering that prior Trail of Dead efforts were just as likely to indulge in New Pornographers-esque indie pop as they were to sludge forward in forests of multi-tracked guitars. There's a fluidity to this record, one that knows when to slide back into haunting atmospherics (\\"Cover the Days like a Tidal Wave\\") and rise back up to another anthemic track like \\"Weight of the Sun.\\"<br /><br />It's a crucial ebb and flow, and one that Trail of Dead long ago proved they had mastered. The best part about Source Tags & Codes was how it all seemed like one cohesive statement, an album's album. Tao of the Dead has that same sense of togetherness, and in as prog-rockish an album as this one, that's an accomplishment indeed. Few bands could go from Who-influenced space jams to pounding punk assaults as effortlessly as they do here, yet remain nimble enough to throw a ballad like \\"Ebb Away\\" in the mix and still make it sound like the missing link to instrumental closer \\"The Fairlight Pendant.\\" The key is in those transitions, the moment where the feedback that closes \\"The Spiral Jetty\\" eases into \\"Weight of the Sun\\" or where the intro's guitars whine down only to explode forth again on \\"Pure Radio Cosplay.\\" They're insignificant in the greater scheme of things, but it's these carefully crafted shifts that give Tao of the Dead that continuous 52-minute feeling that Keely was aiming for.<br /><br />Nowhere is it more evident how far the band has come then in that last 16-minute track, an exercise that could have been a shining example of where noodling goes wrong but instead comes off so driven, so focused that it's impossible to begrudge the band their five movements with names like \\"Rule By Being Just\\" and \\"The Ship Impossible.\\" There's typically frenetic guitar work, spoken-word samples and vaguely krautrock interludes that seem like they should clash but instead come together as an organic whole. It's Keely's best realization of his version of the classical suite that his ambitious mind could put down, and it's a fitting summation to a record that always seems like it should be flying off the rails but never comes close. Things could always be improved - the production is too same-y, too rock radio, and Keely will never be lauded as a master of lyrical restraint. But for the first time in a while, Trail of Dead have an identity that suits them: loud and blatantly brash, modesty not even an afterthought, but with that style, that sound at their forefront. Keely and company may well die before they see another record with the success of Source Tags & Codes, but Tao of the Dead proves their passion should never be questioned.ould have been a shining example of where noodling goes wrong but instead comes off so driven, so focused that it's impossible to begrudge the band their five movements with names like \\"Rule By Being Just\\" and \\"The Ship Impossible.\\" There's typically frenetic guitar work, spoken-word samples and vaguely krautrock interludes that seem like they should clash but instead come together as an organic whole.

0316170720|5.0|In Alice Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" Susie Salmon is tragically killed and subsequently narrates the story of her own death and the search for her that takes place after.  This novel is heart-wrenching at times and poignant at others.  Sebold has a way of telling the story that really makes you feel for the family and Susie in particular.  Overall, I have to say that I genuinely enjoyed this book and could not put it down after reading Page 1. For those looking for a great story with heart and soul, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a must-read.

It has some kind of encryption which prevents HD out put over component, so I might just as well have bought the DVD instead, which was a bunch cheaper. Very disappointing.

B001HN694K|5.0|I love this movie, I have watched it dozens of times and never get tired of it. There is so much symbolism that I saw something new each time for the first 3 or 4 times. The special effects are great and Johnny Depp is great in whatever he does.
030746363X|5.0|I would agree with some of the views that information in this book, or relatively similar information about diet and exercise, is already out there.  I would argue that while he gives you a lots of basics and lots of things to try, his main point is for you to experiment and discover what works best for you.  The book is also setup for you to pick and choose what you might like to experiment with.  It gives you the option of matching your diet and/or strength training to your lifestyle or personality.  I've only been doing the Slow Carb Diet for about two weeks and I'm pleased with the results so far.  I'm not sure how beneficial the book might be for a professional weight lifter, who's also a nutritionist, and a professional sex therapist, but it's pretty good info for the average Joe!  It's also well written and enjoyable to read!

0877180121|5.0|I'm a piano teacher, and I love this book! I find that students as young as 5 or 6 can understand it, and my 3 and 4 year olds are usually ready for this book after a few months of preparatory \\"games.\\" I use this for all my beginners who are teenagers or younger (teenagers usually don't appreciate the \\"monster\\" characters, but they get over it). I'm also thinking about starting all new adult beginners with this book, since I haven't found an adult book I like as well. Many other books start with \\"pre-reading\\" songs, which use note symbols combined with finger numbers, then move to note symbols with letter names, then finally to notes on a staff. This book uses the \\"begin the way you intend to continue\\" theory, and starts students off reading notes on the staff right away instead of confusing them by making them learn 3 different systems of notation. Other books also teach \\"position playing,\\" where students may learn to read notes in C position, then notes in G position, then F position, and so on. The danger of position playing is that students just learn to recognize patterns, and some of my transfer students who had used this method can't play anything unless they are first told where to put their hands. Part One of this John Thompson series stays in one position, but right away in Part Two they have to start learning new notes and moving their hands around, so if they can't read the notes they can't play the song. I love how Part One introduces one note at a time, and simplifies the first song that uses a new note or concept, so students truly learn all of the notes and concepts but aren't overwhelmed. There are a few things I don't like about this series. Part One is very good, and I can't complain too much about it--the first few songs are very boring without the CD, but I can't find any way to make them more interesting without also making it more difficult. Part Two introduces eighth notes too early for many students, and key signatures are introduced right after sharps and flats, which confuses most students. Part Three introduces new notes early in the book, but then doesn't use them in any of the songs that follow. Overall though, it's a great series and I intend to keep using if for all of my future beginners.

B003F3NDOO|5.0|Cougar Town, despite the unfortunate title, is the best comedy since Everybody Loves Raymond.  The cast is incredible.  Each character has his or her own ineffable charm.  The jokes come out of nowhere.  Each episode is worthy of repeat viewing.  It's like Friends, except sophisticated and about grown-ups.    This is the first show I have ever purchased on DVD!  You really must try it.  But, like a few other reviewers suggested, give it several episodes.  Its quirky, unexpected, so-fast-you-might-miss-it humor takes a little while to get at first, but once you do it's priceless.    Janet (Humming \\"Confident in my sexualitay\\" as I write.)
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|This is a great tv series. It is a mush to have the last season of the show. It is very good and shows you how Jack gets out alive. Not to be missed.
0385341679|5.0|I waited for this book's release for 16 months in between Dreamfever and Shadowfever.  I preordered and Amazon provided quick delivery.  Excellent book!!  A terrific ending to a great series.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|I paid almost nothing for it. It has a good music selection, and I didn't have to wait too much to get it.
1594202842|5.0|This book is a Chinese mother's point of view on raising children the Chinese Way vs the \\"American\\" West Way.  As a caucasian in America I found the book very insightful and interesting.  Although I do not agree with her style, and many of the harsh ways she talked to her children and the expectations she put on her children, it helped me understand a culture that I am not familiar with.  It helps me understand the parenting differences between my children and the other children at school that are of Chinese or Asian descent.  It helps me understand why some children are two grade levels ahead always, but at the same time look at the childhood they are missing out on.  Although I do not believe all \\"Western Parents\\" are as spoiling with their children as she portrays, I do see where we have deep issues with lack of good parenting in the areas of Discipline, Respect, Obesity and Education.  I think we can all learn a thing or two from each other.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|This is the best metal album on the market in many years! Every track is intense and moves you the way metal used to move us... Thank God ACCEPT is back! Mark is intense and the Wolfster is burning hot! ACCEPT is the best metal band not named Judas Priest or Iron Maiden.
0756405890|4.0|Since there are nigh a thousand reviews, I'll keep it concise.    Likes:  -The autobiography type format of the novel.  -The story has a good flow    Dislikes:  -Strong lack of character development.  Though, this is supposed to be the main character remembering his past.  Slightly understandable.  -Quite annoyed that nothing gets resolved in this first novel.  The plot drags on, and when something finally may happen... day one is over.  You really have to be certain of your work to think that people will be forced into purchasing the second novel because the first does not resolve anything.      Other Observations (not necessarily a like or dislike):  -Our brilliant young hero has an ineptitude with women that is only equalled by his will to succeed academically.  -There was very little in the way of action; though I only *noticed* this a few times while reading.  -I wish I was a musician talented with the lute.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Shirley Jackson's short story The Lottery is a classic.  This book was just a waste of money and time
B003ZK58WM|2.0|I enjoy historical novels; as I child I remember reading with great enthusiasm trilogy's such as The Good Earth and North and South.  However Ken Follett's, The Fall of Giants takes away any enjoyment of reading a historical novel.  The sad truth is that Mr. Follett does not do a very good job of weaving a story into the events of the time.  Mr. Follett writes heavily about details surrounding the WWI and does not spend enough time on character and plot development.   This a very unnecessarily long book which could have been more interesting if the reader felt more connected with at least one of the characters.    I fear that this will be my first and last Ken Follett novel.  I continued reading only to try to find some redeemable quality in the book.  Sadly, the book has great potential to be the anchor of an epic and moving trilogy, but his focus on superfluous and (quite boring) details prevents one from taking any further interest in any of the characters.    If a history lesson on the First World War and not an enjoyable leisure reading experience is what you seek, then this is the book for you.
B00275EHJG|4.0|Overall this is a good movie for adults.  For kids you might want tio watch it first and see if they will have a problem with the sad parts, the near deaths and overall tragic tone.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|How can you really enjoy reading a book when the dog lets you know fairly early on that things are going to get really, really sad? Thankfully it gets happy here and there and in the end, but you cry there too.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I loved this headset. I say loved because I rolled over the wires with my chair. The cords are very long so proper placement is key if you own a chair with wheels. If you sit on a couch and only use them for gaming just be wary of people stepping on them. These headphones work with PC and PS3. (Did not test on 360)    The sound    FOR THE BEST SOUND YOU DO HAVE TO PLUG IN THE JACK AND USB.    Personally I loved the sound it gave me for video games. The louder the volume the better the sound. The added bass with the expander is very good. Specifically in MW2 and Battlefield Bad Company 2. You get the feeling of where the sound comes from in the direction it does.    One of my favorite options is being able to mute people without having to actually do so yourself. There is a chat volume to turn off all other people talking. Which is fantastic because in games like MW2/Black Ops you sometimes don't want to listen to morons.    For music they aren't audiophile quality but they were much better than my speakers. I would suggest if you are listening to Rock turn off the expander and adjust the bass, if you listen to Hip/Hop rap turn the bass up and the expander on.    The quality of the microphone sound is just as good. It was better than my old mic which made me sound like a 13yr old boy. If you have a unique voice it seems to capture it well.    The feel    At first they gripped rather tightly around my head and hurt my ears. Partly because I have a piercing on my left ear. They seemed to loosen up after a bit of use. They were a little uncomfortable but once they loosen up they become pretty comfortable.     Depending upon where you place the clip it can be comfortable. I placed it on my shirt and part of the cord got in my face. I would suggest putting on your pants. (Probably was meant for that anyway - didn't realize until i broke them)    Cost and final thoughts    For the cost, these are fantastic headphones. I only wish I didn't murder them myself. I loved the compatibly with PC which to me was the selling point. FOR THE BEST SOUND YOU DO HAVE TO PLUG IN THE JACK AND USB.
B003L7DK74|5.0|I ordered Flight of the Conchords through a different conpany and after six weeks of not being sent I had to cancel my order. With this the DVD set came within nine days and is perfect! I am very satisfied with this product and will be using this service again.
0061998885|2.0|very formulaic. read one you,ve read them all. sloppy writing, e.g. has one character as an army brat who followed his father to a large number of stations including north korea. huh?? uses a disguise for one charcter identical to one used by mankell and chesterton before him. substitutes violence, sadism and sex for creativity.
B0037W68F4|5.0|This album is better in every way than oracular spectacular. good to see mgmt making the music they want to this time.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|would love to read it. But i would not pay 14.99 for it, there are some of us that's on a budget, GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1932100660|5.0|A straight-forward discussion about nutrition and its role in disease genesis.  If you are truly interested in preventive medicine this engaging book will be within reach as you sit with your patients and review their eating habits.  It debunks some commonly held yet misinformed ideas concerning why we eat what we eat.
0740797719|5.0|I saw this book in the bookstore and immediately had to order it from Amazon. It's a great handbook for plein air and indoor oil painting. The reproductions of his oil paintings are excellent and unlike most painting technique books, his ideas are shown exactly on the same page as the paintings themselves. It's a great visual book on its own, but one should take the time to read it all - something I don't do with most art books. There is a lot of knowledge packed into this volume and he reveals all the missing understanding of light and color principles that many artists don't have. Buy it NOW!
B004D7GU3C|5.0|Musica + Alma + Sexo finds Ricky in great voice. I can't think of a time his vocals sounded better. The man can craft a heartfelt gorgeous ballad with the best of em. I was partial to Basta Ta but there are other beauties. Often if a singer has a good enough vocal instrument for a ballad they can't tear lose and do justice to up tempo songs, not a problem for Mr. Martin. MAS is a good example of that ability. He does laid back and bouncy with numerous versions of The Best Thing About Me Is You. I like the version he does solo best. I would rate this his best work since Vuelve. LOVE this album and can't wait to see him in concert.
1592402690|5.0|If you're interested in knowing a lot of the details about how a few of the Beatles' songs were made, you'll like this book. I read it straight through. Emerick especially covers Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, and Abbey Road. Some of the details were a bit more technical than needed and I would have liked to have known more about how and why the songs were written. Emerick was the Engineer so his side of it was putting all the sounds together. Also, he has a tight friendship with McCartney so he probably heaped more praise on him than the others. But it was very interesting and felt like we were right there in the studio (or control booth) with him.
B003X2O6KW|4.0|This is what we have come to discover about Kanye West. Yes we know he's not a singer. Neither is he definitively a rapper. We do know he's arrogant not close to being humble. However, overtime we do know Kanye is indeed an artist. Someone who fully understands the creative process in making music. He's also someone who very much understands the predecessors who created music before himself and gives homage to it on this album. This a rooted album that gives a soulful representation of his genre of hip hop interpreted by Mr. Kanye himself. And he does it very well.<br /><br />The first track Dark fantasy is an ode to RZA production Of Wu Tang Clans songs with its looped piano hook. He rhymes in sync with the songs mood and the other surrounding elements for effect. He makes use of orchestral sounds but still maintains its core hip hop flow.<br /><br />To hear trumpets clearly blaring along in the song \\"All of the Lights\\" is refreshing to hear. Rihanna plays her part in the chorus hook of the song's demanding nature for you to pay attention to the song and what Kanye expresses lyrically. Throughout the entire album Kanye showcases how much of his skills have evolved since his debut album.<br /><br />The album has sounds of hip hop, soul, pop, some classical(and if you watch the 30 minute Runaway video, you can see how ballet hip hop is performed) and his use of the vocoder is now done in parts where it best suits a song. This album overall it captures your ear with interest and appeal of what we do like best about Kanye...his music.
B000002MFQ|1.0|I'm a big Oldfield fan from his early, pre-TB days with Kevin Ayers and others and on to his early solo work. The original TB was amazing and much imitated, but this is a shallow retread. The same format and musical themes appear, but nothing new is added. Avoid it.
B000ZELISO|5.0|When I received my blue ray, it came with a nice, beautiful cover. It is worth a lot more than I paid for it. In fact, I paid for my last DVD a lot more than this.its a great price
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|The quality of this movie is very regular. Don't expect any kind of extra content or any fancy thing; it is just the box with the BD. No book, no more than a couple of languages and no \\"behind the camera\\". My box was broken and it doesn't close. Not a big issue, a BD box is about 50 cents, I´m not going to return the product for that, but in any case it is hard to imagine how you should handle this kind of things to break apart the closure of the case.
1591843162|2.0|Seth Godin is trying to get full-length mileage out of an essay, and we end up with a load of puffed air.  The central kernel is inspired, interesting, and intriguing, but there is only so many ways you can examine the same idea.  This could have been better, and by better I mean shorter.
B00436GNVC|5.0|I honestly think the other reviewers out there are listening to a different recording. Endlessly is very worthy to Rockferry. Lightning rarely strikes twice. The thunder follows. Sophmore albums rarely match the original. This serves up as many \\"tearjerkers\\" as the first. All comparisons to Rockferry aside. This is a great record!     On its own, it is miles ahead of all of its competition. Is there any? Duffy is in a class by herself, with her torch songs. She has an uncanny ability to pay tribute to the classic sounds of the 1960s. There is not one cover anywhere to be found, yet I have a total sense of nostalgia within the tracks. There are some more contemporary sounding tracks. Yes, its more danceable at times. Is that bad? Not at all. Perhaps listeners will listen with a gentle ear and find the beauty of Duffy and Endlessly!
B00006AG5N|5.0|This CD lives up to expectations.  The songs are shortened versions (2-4 minutes each) but I love them all.  It's in my car's CD player and is played every time I'm driving.  Haven't listened to anything else since I received it.
B00479SVBU|3.0|I have previously purchased [[ASIN:B001DDE4VY Soundfly BT Ultimate Bluetooth Car Fm Transmitter]] from the same company for my following needs.  That previous purchase did not have a screen and did not play music through aux out (then what is the point of aux out ?) and several other issues.  When I complained to the customer service, they listened to me while I explained all the improvements that could be made and sent me a test device which had high treble and could not fix my AUX issue.  Then they said they are coming up with a new MP3 device soon and will send me a sample device for all the testing and feedback I gave them.  They did not send it (it has been more than a year I think).  So, I went ahead and purchased this new device myself.  Here is what I found.    My needs:  1. I listen to lot of music, lectures, audio books.  2. Lot of music I listen (Indian Classical) has long tracks (30 minutes or more).  3. I listen to recorded lectures which run easily more than 45 minutes on a single track.  4. I wanted a mp3 player that can sit in the car cigarette adapter (without bothering me about battery charging) and let me use an SD card so that it is easy to add/remove audio files.    GOOD:  - This device looks well built.  I had to use little force to get it into my cigarette light adapter and did not break or come apart.  - Plays MP3 and WMA files.  - Nice volume. FM sounds fine.  But, I use AUX port.    BAD:  - My drive to work is around 15-20 minutes.  Lot of my music tracks are longer than my drive time.  When I get to the destination, I park and turn the engine off (muscle memory).  When I get back to the car, it starts playing the track from the beginning.  THERE IS NO WAY TO FAST FORWARD on the device (it is on the remote, but hard to fast forward reliably.  Not sure if I am doing something wrong).  I have to listen through the same thing again until it gets back to the point where I had stopped.  Read below about bookmarking feature.  But, like most people, when I get to the destination (work, grocery store etc.,) my mind is occupied with something or the other (meetings, kids in backseat etc.,) and hard to remember to bookmark before turning the car off.  It should auto save the current position once every minute or two (on the SD card/USB).    There is a bookmarking feature.  It is kind of painful to use.  Let us say you bookmark after listening 45 minutes into a lecture track.  When you start the car next time, it starts from the bookmark whether you want it or not.  Let us assume that is what you want.  You continue listening from the bookmark, that track finishes, you skip to another folder/track and continue listening.  Now, you park the car, come back later and start the car.  Guess what, it starts from the bookmark again!  You get an opportunity to hit yourself on the head for forgetting to clear the bookmark.  Now you are back to scratching the head about where you were in listening.  :)    - Display, when lit up looks cheap.  It is lighted.  There is a little light bulb towards the top of the screen under the glass display.  So, it is very bright there.  Rest of the screen gradually dulls.    - Scrolling is kind of jerky, hard to read if you have long track names.  Instead of using tall narrow fonts, if they use rounder fonts, it will be easy to read when scrolling.    - AUX cable sticks out straight more than an inch.  I mentioned this to the company before, they probably are not paying attention.  Please ship with L shaped connector on one end.  Now it is protruding towards my leg when driving and can easily get broken.  I can't turn the unit otherway, because, then display will be harder to read.  An L shaped connector would have made it stay inside the center console neatly.  This is something I had mentioned to the company during my testing and they had promised to ship with L connectors for newer products.  I am looking to buy one myself that is not too long, so that I can replace it.    - No way torepeat the whole folder (just repeats a single track). When I am driving with my children, I want to repeat the folder which has their favorite music.  It is annoying to have to press little buttons while driving to get back the same folder.    Update 4/13/2011:  - When using AUX out (which is what I do), it still broadcasts 'silence' on the channel that is preset.  That basically means, it would be blanking out the radio station for all cars in about 300 ft circle around me.  I have tested this with a friend driving about 300 ft behind me while on a vacation trip.  For now, I have set the station to something I think is unused in my area (just to avoid blanking the channel for others).  I would have liked no broadcast on FM while using AUX-out (instead of broadcasting silence).    - SDHC cards inserted in the device gets really hot.  Makes me worry if the cards would become unusable all of a sudden due to that heat.  I have few SDHC cards.  Typically, I would like to have one playing in the car for several days while I am filling the other one with interesting songs/lectures/books etc.,   memory cards are becoming less expensive.  But, still I would not like to keep buying them like consumables.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I ordered the X41s from Amazon to be shipped to Singapore. The package was well padded and arrived in pristine condition. I set it up last night on my Xbox 360, wired the transmitter via optical TOS cable to the Xbox and my Yamaha amp. Took abt 10 mins (wld have been shorter if i remembered to remove the TOS cable tip covers!). Ordered an extra Belkin TOS cable to do the output connection. Overall, all done in 15 mins tops! Now to the game! Fired up the 360 and loaded COD:Black Ops. The game sounds and chat are really good - clear, crisp with loads of treble and bass depending on your taste and how you set the bass expander. The 7.1 surround sound does a fair job but you must use the TOS optical links to get it right. I really love how you can adjust the chat and game sound at your fingertips. Much better compared to my other Steel Series Siberia headband which needed to change the game and Xbox volume settings, hence the disruption. There is only 1 minor issue i found with the X41, is the rare and occasional clicking noise in the background presumably caused by high data sound transfer. This is for example when the Rocket is launching off in Zombies Ascension when a lot of sound is being transmitted. I had positioned the transmitter next to my LCD TV. I may try re-positioning it a little closer or higher to minimise any blockage. Will update at a later time. The other reason cld be the headset batteries either weakening or fluctuating. May want to try Lithium rechargeables vs alkaline. All in all, a good headset and indeed recommended!
B000FC2PKG|4.0|For one dollar, Alone deserves to be a top kindle read. For less than the price of a cup of coffee, you get all the kick and buzz of a super sized latte.  MMMM- it's a caffeine kick on a kindle for a buck! Sure, the story is a bit unwieldy and at times whiny. So, while this may not be a super supreme venti made with the finest ingredients money can buy, this is no luke-warm/gas station offering either. It's a mystery kept percolating with some fine moments and interesting characters. There is a lot going on in Alone- there's the sniper cop (hottie with issues), the beautiful widow (medea-like-mommy), the tragic past (ripped from headlines), the sick child (and mysterious illness), the psycho (familiar and creepy), the judge (never trust a judge), and the secret worth killing for. Lisa Gardner is worth checking out for her pacing and Alone was a fun introduction to her work. Bottom line- like a decent cup of uninspired coffee- this book is cheap and while it many not be that good for you, it is a lot of fun to enjoy.
B000002GYR|4.0|Tonight is my first real experience with Tom Waits.  I tried getting into his music several years ago but it never worked out for one reason or another.  Actually it wasn't a bad experience or anything- I just had OTHER bands that were more important to me at the time, so I focused on them instead.  Now however, it's time to approach Tom Waits output with an open mind.    Closing Time is a pretty good listen, but not *quite* as good as many people would have you believe.  I was told Tom's voice resembles the legendary Captain Beefheart, but I find the good Captain a much better singer as far as striking me on a deep emotional level is concerned.  The good Captain also had a much deeper growling sound to his amazing vocal range in addition to being a better songwriter in my opinion but still... this isn't a complaint against Tom Waits who definitely has his own distinct style we need to consider as well.      I'd say Tom Waits has a voice that sounds pretty similar to Bob Dylan (at least on this particular album) and every so often a Bruce Springsteen similarity wouldn't be out of the question either.      The opener \\"Ol' 55\\" is a slowed down and more emotionally sincere version of a song that would become a small hit for the Eagles, and well... I kind of prefer the Eagles version more, but it's close.  I admire Tom Waits style here though- he's really trying to get an emotional reaction out of the listener, and it works.      My favorite songs would be \\"Old Shoes (and Picture Postcards)\\" and \\"Martha\\".  Tom Waits really floors me with the vocal performance of a lifetime on \\"Martha\\".  Absolutely incredible song THAT one is because of the sincere tone in Waits voice.  As for the former song, well it's just a really nice country-tinged and catchy chug along-type tune.      Other moments are not so spectacular such as \\"Grapefruit Moon\\" which sounds to me like a severely dated and lyrically unsatisfying attempt at combining cheesy orchestral arrangements with pop songwriting.  Blah.  \\"Little Trip to Heaven\\" is a decent attempt at delivering with a smokey late night jazzy atmosphere, and it works.  I like it.    Lyrically this is a collection of songs that probably hits really close to home for many people, but for me, well... not so much.  Still, it's a good album and I have a feeling Tom Waits made better albums in the future.  I'm not really in a big hurry to hear more, however.  This certainly isn't the same kind of diversity and experimentation that made Captain Beefheart so legendary.  However it should be noted that Closing Time is still diverse in its own respectable kind of way.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|I have been searching for a colourized version of this movie for a long time.  I watched with a grin on my face throughout the whole movie.  The colours are exactly as I imagined they would be.  The package includes the black and white version and song CD which are also priceless.
B001SC9G5O|5.0|An eye-opener of a book for those of us who have been pottering around in the stockmarket for years , quietly assuming all is good , all will be well . This book will shake you out of your complacent assumptions . ...........

It was slow progress getting through to the end , because you need to take time every few pages or paragraphs , to contemplate Taleb's thoughts     So my successes in the stockmarket wasn't entirely brilliance on my part ; and the losses weren't totally due to the Norse gods and goat's entrails conspiring against me ? ......

0307592839|3.0|Suicide, drug addiction, overdoses, AIDS, strokes, relapses, psychosis, anorexia, infidelity, intergenerational sex, interracial sex, underage sex, heterosex, homosex, public sex, sexual dysfunction, terrorism, theft, prison time, cults, racism, homophobia, paranoia, drowning, genocidal dictators, Stockholm syndrome, lion attacks and online dating.    Oh, pardon me: spoiler warning.    So yeah, a lot happens in what amounts to a 200-page novel. It happens to a group of people interconnected by family, friendship and chance over the greater part of a century. The main problem I had with this novel is that these lives don't ring true because we mostly observe them only during these moments of extreme, and sometimes extremely implausible, experience.    The \\"Powerpoint\\" section of the book, comprising the other 70 pages (which you can read in just a few minutes) is the only portion that suggests the real truth - that life is won and lost in its small moments.    But too often everything is grandiose and unnecessarily dramatic. Drugs heighten the senses of the characters in almost every story here but they're just a shortcut for the writer to propel us into these moments where everything is momentous and life-changing. By the same token, New York is expanded (reduced) to a juvenile ideal of adventure and potential and magic that seems bloodless if you've ever listened to a Lou Reed album, let alone done drugs or clocked your 30th birthday. 9/11 is invoked several times to no real purpose other than to, once again, announce Serious Emotions.    All that said, this book is fairly well-written. Egan has some stylish turns of phrase and her various first-person voices are reasonably convincing (except the \\"Selling the General\\" section, which is silly and no good). The theme is that time makes fools of us all, and much more than that, as we each may live any number of different lives within our span of years. We'll all have some amazing and terrible things happen to us on the way (stuff you couldn't make up if you tried) but for the most part it won't be anything like the stock melodrama of Egan's characters.    Fictional characters obviously don't need to be \\"realistic\\" to resonate with a truth, but they need to be truthful to feel real instead of being just words on a page. These ones don't make it.
B0042816YK|5.0|i was really surprised with the great quality of the video and its box. I was expecting scratches on the dvd and a damaged box, so i was really happy to find i was wrong in this case. I will probably buy from this seller again.
0439023521|5.0|Tonight I finished reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. In this science fiction novel set in a post-USA North Amerca governed by the despotic Capitol, the 12 regions of the country of Panem send two youths to the annual Hunger Games. These randomly selected kids will fight to the death for the pleasure and amusement of the capitol. The hunger games are the legacy of a treaty that ensued from a rebellion that just didn't work out for the ordinary people.<br /><br />Collins's novel explores the effect of despotism and violence on children. Katniss Everdeen, the main character and narrator, simply lacks the emotional experience and resources to take in all that is expected of her. In short, she doesn't know how to play the game--until she must.<br /><br />In the name of control, the Hunger Games would reduce the 12 youths--called tribugtes--to savages.The Capitol takes some pleasure in treating human decency, compassion, and love as affectations. The plot thickens when Katniss, and her Region 12 compatriot and unlikely parter Peeta Mellarkin refuse to accept the basic premise that they are worthless. By insisting that life is worth something, that love is worth something, by refusing to be manipulated by a system that seems them as a source of entertainment rather than human beings, Katniss complicates the games and the very idea of control.<br /><br />Control is a choice. Just ask the kids who win.
B0021L8V1G|5.0|Great movie - It shows that a movie can be made without extreme violence, profanity or nudity to be good entertainment.
B0041KKYD8|2.0|its a good movie but can NEVER be compared to the original that was banned in the US for extreme rape scenes. This one is calm, not much gore, pretty slow, nothing extreme, i would say this one is a NC-17. Nowadays there are tons of horror/slasher movies with lot more gore and disgusting scenes and the women is physically tortured than this remake! Pretty boring actually.. She falls in the river and shows up a month later with not a single scar.. It doesn't even show how this city girl survived in the woods for a month!!?! She just shows up with new clothes and make-up.. now that is weird..
B00003CXA6|5.0|Movie worked great on my DVD player. Increased size by 25% to fill in on standard TV.  Had to return the first order with full screen viewing.  The full screen DVD came from Great Britain and would not work on my DVD player in the USA.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is an exciting read. I was able to feel the emotion of the characters. I did not want to put my kindle down because it was really exciting. If you want an exciting book where you can feel the emotion of the characters, then I recommend this book.
159448385X|5.0|Getting a glimpse of what it was like to be a woman in Afghanistan made my heart ache for the characters and their daily struggles.  Though A Thousand Splendid Suns was at times hard to finish as I was crying and cringing for these women, I found myself  desperate to see how their stories would end.  After loving The Kite Runner I was unsure that this next book would be able to compete but I loved it even more.  I think this was because it was told through a woman's perspective and the familiarity of emotions.  Hosseini has a true talent for telling the stories of Afghan people where readers are able to really get a new perspective of what life is like in other parts of the world.  He portrays the cruelty in this world that is heartbreaking but enlightening to those of us who have never experienced such brutality.
B0038AUY96|5.0|A superb novel. The Snowman, pacey and gritty with many twists and turns, is the perfect thriller. I thought I figured it all out at least three times but failed completely to spot the killer. In addition to his ability to keep the reader on his toes all the way through, Nesbo is fantastic when it comes to his characters and Harry Hole, the troubled and tortured police inspector, is impossible not to fall in love with. Harry should be tiresome with his alcohol problems, anti-authoritarian personality and messed up relationships, but Nesbo has managed to make him the most compelling fictional detective I have ever come across. I would recommend this novel to anyone with a strong heart and a fondness for suspense.

B0040LGV12|5.0|In my opinion, this is the only way to watch the Lost series!  I admit that I was \\"lost\\" when trying to watch the series on TV some years back because I would miss an episode or a certain portion of one.  This series does not allow for any interruptions because of it's convoluted and often confusing story-line.  With the DVD set, I can go back and review episodes to help make sense of what I'm watching!  Great gift for any stay at home person who has time on their hands to sit and watch hours of TV.

0767903862|5.0|Like all of Bill Bryson's books, In a Sunburned Country is a hilarious look at the people and places of another country.  In this book, Bryson travels to Australia and has a variety of adventures.  He always stumbles finds himself in hilarious and awkward situations.  The book is littered with interesting tidbits about the country, from the history of Australia to the animals that inhabit it.  Another interesting aspect of his journey is the conversations he has with Australian locals, in both the large cities and the small towns in the middle of the desert.  It's interesting to see how they perceive their country and how they view Americans.  Lastly, Bryson makes you realize how similar people are in all parts of the world.  Though everyones home is a different place, they all have the same feelings about why they call it home and why they love it.  I would recommend this book to anyone, especially people interested in travel.    Griffin Mason
0307454541|3.0|For about a year, everywhere I went people were reading this book or one of the sequels. It was getting quite ridiculous. Eventually I realized I was the last white person in America to have not read this book, so there was a little peer pressure, including from my wife. I finally broke down and read it to see what the fuss was all about. For about the first 1/2 of the book, I was really a little bored and kept thinking, \\"What is the big deal? When is this thing finally going to pick up?\\" Finally in the second half things do get more interesting and faster paced. On the whole, it is a pretty good read but doesn't seem worth all the hype. I think the salacious content had something to do with all the attention. By the way, I saw the Swedish version of the movie recently and it too was a little disappointing, especially the bland male lead.
B000YPWDSS|5.0|Just a short note to say that the mastering on this version is much better than the standard edition.  The dynamics are much better, and is not mastered as loud as the standard edition.  Plus, the bonus disk of covers is outstanding!  Very nice book with lyrics also.
B0015AARJI|4.0|An original Sony PlayStation 3 wireless controller, just like the one that comes with the [[ASIN:B003VUO6H4 PlayStation 3 160 GB]]. One feature I like about this is that you can charge it through a USB cable that is connected to the PS3 Console. This way, you can keep using the controller when it is charging (although you will loose the ability to use it from afar on your sofa so you may have to pluck up a chair next to the console if you want to keep playing).     Other Thoughts: I think placing only 1 controller with the gaming system is a marketing strategy by Sony. So far, nearly 85-90% of games on PS3 are multi-player with multi player support (as in more than one player on the same console) and the console itself supports several controllers (I think it was upto 4) at once. So, if you want to play with your friends or brother(s), you will have to get another controller. Of course, you could always tell your friends to bring their own controllers over :P
B004LQI0HE|2.0|I think the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around was the concept that in the 80's and 90's there would be a plausible scenario where people were designated solely for organ donation; and that it was okay.  I was practically screaming, \\"Why don't you just cut off the bracelets and leave?\\"  I mean really?  That is the biggest problem I had with the movie, because all of the characters seemed a little too comfortable and accepting of their circumstances and eventual fate, no one tried to run or fight.  If it had been set in the 50's, like it kind of looked like it was, I would have been slightly more accepting of the premise, but otherwise I just couldn't accept the plot.  The only saving grace of this movie was the actors, they all turned in pretty good performances, and \\"almost\\" made me believe the plot.
B002WCLG48|5.0|This is done in the style of the \\"Animatrix\\" DVD. Short stories about the HALO universe. Two explain the origin, which is great. The others are all action. Only one DBZ style is silly. If your a fan get this DVD !!!
0307266303|5.0|I've attempted to run off and on for fitness for years, but have never stuck with it. Injuries usually weren't the problem as with the author of this book and many others, just boredom and laziness. I admire those who do though and have a much better understanding of their joy of running after reading this. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of the Indians, the history and science of running and running shoes, and the races. Above all, this book has great characters. It is an engrossing read, even for non-runners.
0670022411|3.0|Dr. Diana Bishop has tried her hardest to stay away from her heritage. Diana is one of the last Bishop witches. As try as she might, Diana just can not escape, who she is. Just take Diana's latest research project...Diane ends up checking out an alchemy manuscript known as Ashmole 782. When Diana touches the manuscript, she feels a charge...a magical one.<br /><br />Matthew Clairmont is a professor at Oxford. He is also a vampire. Matthew can sense something evil is descending upon Oxford. Matthew shows an interest in Diana. Though is Matthew getting close to Diana because he likes her or for another reason?<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches is author, Deborah Harkness first novel. While I did enjoy this book. I thought that it moved at a really slow pace. It seemed liked most of the book was just explaining and build up of the story and the characters to help lead into the next book. The problem for me with this book was that every time the story would start to pick up speed, it would slow down for more explanation. It felt like for every one step forward I would take, I would get knocked back two steps. I was not feeling the romantic relationship between Diana and Matthew. In the beginning Diana really hated Matthew and the next moment she was in love with him. There was something mysterious about Matthew that did make him intriguing. So I could possibly see where Diana could like Matthew.<br /><br />While, I did not love this book, the story line was appealing enough to want to make me read the next book. Overall, I do have to applaud Deborah Harkness as she did bring her knowledge and realism to the book and Diana. Being a professor herself, I thought Ms. Harkness did a good job with Diana. A Discovery of Witches delves into a magical, innovative world that will have you wanting some more.
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|This is one of my favorites movies. The storyline is well done, visual and sound effects are very good, even compared with more recent movies.  This blu-ray has an spetacular image and sound, and the extras are very interesting, too.  This is a must have to any blu-ray collection.  In one word: Fascinating!
B0046ZG2VG|3.0|This film is sort of all over the map, which I guess you might expect from a film labeled \\"experimental.\\"      The Bad: You can not in all fairness call this a 600ASA film.  More like 100.  They will come out blank in anything less than about the brightness of dim florescents (night shots are out).  The need to cover them when they come out of the camera can also lead to mishaps.  And at the hefty price of about $3 a shot, those blank shots are really painful.    The Good: When these do come out, they come out amazing.  Like nothing else out there.  If you are looking for a unique artsy look, these are pretty fine.  Also, you can find Poleroid 600 cameras for dirt cheap on Ebay.  My camera cost less than the pack of film.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I saw this movie before purchasing it & knew I had to have it for my collection.I'm so glad I did, I've made everyone I know watch it and everyone has loved it so far. Great cast and just great overall.
0143038419|2.0|This book was quite a bit more boring than I expected. I began reading it a few days before I left for my trip to Italy, hoping to get a surge of energy for the trip ahead. I attempted to read it on the plane but was so uninterested that I could not finish the book. It lacked substance. There was no exciting, high point of the story. I felt that I was being dragged along through this boring trip. A trip to these places is something that many people will never do in their lifetime. I think that is why this book drew the attention of so many people. Books are supposed to be exciting and take you to places you'll never see. But after reading it, I was not impressed. I was hoping for a wild journey of a woman finding herself. I did not expect it to be so shallow and uninteresting. It did not give me the inspiration I was hoping for.
6305754969|5.0|One of Wayne's best. All actors involved were excellent and the story-line was the best of all three scenario films. Robert Mitchum, his deputy and James Caan make this action film comedic at times invoking more than just a serious western but an interesting plot that tops all three makes.
B003GDFQX4|5.0|I read The Day of the Jackal 15 years ago for the first time and haven't picked it up since. After reading two brilliantly satisfying international thrillers, [[ASIN:B004JF4J54 Trojan Horse]] and [[ASIN:0743458060 Single & Single]], I was moved to go back and see if Jackal was really as good as I remembered.  It is.  Some of the politics are now dated, and the technology is quaintly simplistic, but the plot still retains that gripping pace. The pleasant surprise was that the nuances in the characters and their interrelationships were extraordinarily well painted. This was one of the reasons I wanted to go back to Jackal; the characters in [[ASIN:B004JF4J54 Trojan Horse]] and [[ASIN:0684859262 Single & Single]]had impressed me so, that I wanted to confirm my belief in this old master. Well done, Mr Forsyth! Wish you were still around.

B00127RAJY|5.0|My wife and i love Biggest Loser and Jillian Michaels. We also love this DVD. the exercises are awesome and for me personally are the perfect motivator to step it up a notch. the only thing i could possibly say about this DVD has nothing to do with Jillian or the workout rather the DVD itself. why on earth would you create a workout DVD with a 10 minute introduction that you can't skip over. it's a real pain [...]that a 20-minuter workout becomes a 30-minute workout with 10 minutes of sitting on the couch with the remote control in your hand waiting to get to the menu. i make DVDs for a living and it's not that difficult to add a menu function. don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with watching Jillian Michaels for 10 minutes before you workout but after the first couple times you just want to get right into it, like Jillian would. unfortunately you technically can't. however with that said, i am not mr. workout by far but i find myself wanting to do this. c'mon you can spare 20 minutes right!?
B003Y5H51K|5.0|Great entertainment. All the things that can go wrong in a cave. Flooding, hair getting stuck on descender/stuck on a water fall ascent/ rope cut, panic, out of air, last resort radical rescue techniques, equipment failure, fall, rock fall, back up taken for granted, failure to listen to reason, etc. Lights are the lifeline in caving just like air for scuba.  This is as hardcore caving can get. Key there was to evacuate early. Ego and panic kills in this environment. Exlploration push fever is  like having the summit fever. This is a cavers dream without  murphy. Too bad for the tragedy. Great diving movie just like the Abyss and Le Grand Bleu.  Read Beyond the Deep.

B004JVXTL8|1.0|the movie was not worth 4 dollars, nor was it worth the wait. the movie looks cheap, and confuses you. its not till the end that you kinda understand what happens. i dont see how so many people liked this movie. it sucked. there was only one good part which lasted about 4 to 5 minutes our of a hour and a half. it could have been made better. but it was lame... thumbs down from me.
030726999X|5.0|I loved all of Stieg Larson;s three books about Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist. Not living in Sweden, the names and places were rather hard to follow, however, once one gets past that hurdle, the books were very well writen<br />and interesting. Just when you think that you have it all figured out, Larson brings in another twist of events<br />The main character, Lisbeth is truly unique and fascinating, you just  help but love her. I enjoyed the book very much, but I had to read about half of it before I really got into it, but after that I was hooked. I also enjoyed \\" The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo\\" and \\" The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" as well as this book \\" The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest.\\"'
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|Insurrection is well written and investigates the moral question of relocating or destroying cultures and civilizations that are not caught up in technology for the sake of a desired commodity. The Next Generation commands the Enterprise and must decide whether or not to follow orders or \\"Do the right thing.\\" There is some good humor and more romance when the crew begins to experience the effects of planet surface.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie was so sweet and gut wrenching at the same time. No problems at all with the DVD.  I applaud the prompt service I got.  I never even had a chance to consider how long before I get the movie.  Felt like it was almost overnighted.  VERY HAPPY!
B0009SOFFY|5.0|The Stooges at their gutbucket best.They give new meaning to the term\\"Murder City\\"and they define what is great about Motown flavored rock.Detroit is underrated as far as rock bands go but Stooges and MC5 make the case that Detroit truly rocks.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Besides being one of the best films of our generation, The Social Network is one of the best DVDs I've bought in a long time. Both commentaries are great, David Fincher's from a more technical point of veiw and Sorkin/the cast's from a fun one. \\"How Did They Ever Make a Movie out of Facebook?\\" is an interesting and fun documentary on disc 2, and all the other special features are equally entertaining. Did I mention the DVD case itself is rather gorgeous?  Of course, the combination of Eisenberg and Aaron Sorkin should really be all the convincing you need to buy this beautiful movie.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|The second season of Castle is much better than season one (except for the S&M themed episode The Mistress Spanks Twice which I recommend skipping). In season two the plots get more intricate and intriguing.<br /><br />Series one was promising but overall somewhat disappointing. The acting is fair but the main actor, a witty writer, seems content with delivering his lines with a quasi-cheesinsess that borders on campiness. This quality is diminished in season two. And his female counter part, a spunky cop, starts to compliment Castle's role much better.<br /><br />The supporting characters all seem to be rounding out their roles. The mom has lost much her manic campiness and is in much better form this season.
B001VNB54A|2.0|Just FYI... I loved BAND OF BROTHERS.  Just about my favorite war series ever.  However, \\"The Pacific\\" starts off well-intended, but soon turns into a soap-opera & semi-porn drama.  Can't believe this had the same directors and production crew.<br /><br />Great acting, but dives way too far into the personal lives of the soldiers.  There is nudity and a lot of needless sex.  Even if you're okay with that, it's simply distracting and out of place.<br /><br />When it came on I DVR'd and invited my dad over (thinking it was another \\"Band of Brothers\\"-style movie.  Very uncomfortable to watch, especially with a bunch of other \\"dudes\\" around.  You better keep this far away from the kids too, of course.<br /><br />Sorry, gets a 2 star from me.  Very sadly disappointed.  I need more of the inspirational Band of Brothers type of productions.
B004HAG40O|5.0|Somehow I managed to not hear anything about this album until it came out, and let me tell you, it was like Christmas all over again. So, have The Decemberists done it again, or have they choked? If you're in a hurry, I'll clue you in. They've not only done it again, they've outdone themselves.    This album may be indie folk or folk rock or whatever, but it also captures all of the good points of country, the slow melodies, the fiddle, slide guitars, and pedal-steel, that amazingly paradoxical upbeat-melancholy atmosphere; and simultaneously avoids the gaudy big-rigging redneck and proud aspect of modern country that is so unappealing. In many ways it feels like a more refined version of the old country greats, Waylon Jennings, Merle Haggard, Emmylou Harris, and the rest. Not to say that this album sounds old, it incorporates this lovely old feeling while still being fresh and new, putting a whole new facet on their folk sound.    This entire album feels happy. Some of the songs have sad lyrics, and some are definitely more subdued, but the plucky guitar (or fiddle, or banjo, depending on the song) and the almost  hopeful sound of the harmonica keep the whole album on a happy tone. I've already mentioned the Decemberists' talent for finding female vocalists (continued on this album by Gillian Welch, among others), but I think Colin Meloy is even better on this record than he was on the last, his vocals really compliment the tone of the record well.    I can't tell you guys how pleased I am with this album (besides this sickeningly fannish review, that is), it's met every hope I had for The Decemberists' sound, and then some. We're not even a month in and already I've found an album that I'm sure is going to be in my top ten; let's hope that this is a portent of good things to come this year. Even if it isn't, I've got `The King Is Dead' to keep me company.    [...]
B004DK49DW|2.0|First couple tracks are cool then it all goes down hill from there. The music is not that good. I only recommend this to the HARDCORE fans because this is one hard pill to swallow. Listen to it for yourself....very redundant dry Social D album. Personally (my opinion, this album was not worth my money, it was as though Social D barely even tried)
0307389839|5.0|I enjoy Murakami's work in general and knowing this is not his regular fiction, I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. I actually bought this for my brother, who runs marathons, who has to travel to Japan sometimes for work, but who doesn't read much.  I thought it would be a good introduction for him to one of Japan's most important writers. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the book and sigh of all sighs, will have to buy my brother his own copy because I'm not giving this one up.  People who like his fiction will appreciate a bit of insight into his own life, writers will appreciate insight into his methodology and discipline, and runners will appreciate his long term, long distance love of the sport.  I will read it again for sure!
0446672653|5.0|This book is very well written.  It is easy to follow and profoundly resonating.  It shows how our lives are not left to chance but are specific.  It shows you how love lives throught lifetimes and relationships.  It will help compassion grow within you and you won't be able to put it down.  It is a book you should buy for yourself and everyone else you are sharing your lifetime with.  Love IS real and you will know and feel that for certain after reading this book.

B0037KMHRY|5.0|I am a great fan on movie soundtracks, but had never listened to Daft Punk before discovering them via Tron Legacy. The pieces they put together here are a strange (to me, at least) mixture of electronica and classical sounds that create a dynamic and energetic score that works very well for the action and dramatic elements of the film. It's definitely music that you can feel. Also, I find that I enjoy it more and more as I play it louder and louder, and that's always a good sign. Two thumbs up for Daft Punk and Tron Legacy.

B000H2FDTO|5.0|If you expect a shoot em up, consider looking elsewhere. Stephen Gaghan's script is pure genius, but you have to watch carefully; everything significant - and much is - shows up again and again but you must really pay attention in order to see it.

If you're a viewer who likes a movie that leaves you with questions which reach beyond the the film iteslf, Syriana is a good choice. Watch it twice.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|Those who have read earlier Lisa Gardner suspense novels should be warned that her 2005 breakthrough novel \\"Alone\\" is a much leaner and meaner story than they may have come to expect from Gardner, who manages here both to tighten her plot and to create characters of lasting interest.<br /><br />\\"Alone\\" introduces Bobby Dodge, Massachusetts state police sniper, who is called to a domestic hostage situation - a young mother and her small son are being held prisoner by her gun-wielding husband.  As Bobby watches through his rifle scope, the screaming husband moves to pull the trigger and Bobby becomes the only one who can save the woman and child.<br /><br />But did Trooper Dodge read the situation correctly?  Who was the victim?  The distraught wife turns out to be Catherine Gagnon, who survived a childhood  kidnapping and rape, and has learned to use her incredible beauty to manipulate the men in her world.  Also, according to her in-laws, she is an unfit mother who may be responsible for her four-year-old son's frequent trips to the ER.  Was Jimmy Gagnon, Catherine's husband, a loving father attempting to end his marriage and save his son, or a drunken bully?<br /><br />Is Bobby Dodge a hero?  Or a murderer?  As the Boston Police Department team, led by Bobby's former lover, D.D. Warren, investigates the shooting, Bobby faces a civil suit brought by Jimmy's parents.<br /><br />Gardner has written a tight novel filled with memorable characters.  Bobby and Catherine are fully developed, complex characterizations.  D.D. Warren, Gardner's iconic police detective, has a lesser, but important, role to play here.  And for those who have read the later novels, fear not, she's as hungry and irascible as ever.<br /><br />There are no easy answers in this mystery, and the suspense builds with each chapter.<br /><br />Four Stars.  The bottom line?  \\"Alone\\" is a tightly written suspense novel containing interesting and well developed characters.  However, the `shoot out' near the end, as many reviewers have noted, is difficult to follow and clumsy.

B001P9EQH8|4.0|Its inexpensive, its pretty effective for my 30 dollar headphones by sennheiser. I like the heightened clarity in some songs. Not all songs are great but that's probably due to other factors like sound coding within a song or because i haven't equalized all my songs to the same decibels. Its good though if your headphones cost maybe 30-60 dollars. Im betting the E7 is alot better and this amp is probably better with 100-150 marginally (those headphones should sound pretty good anyway). I get my SK Pro's by skullcandy next week so we'll see how much better they sound. Im pretty satisfied for now untill i get enough money to venture out and get other brands/models.

The illustrations of multi-cultural babies allows them to see that kids all look different, and it's got a lovely rhyming verse to accompany the pictures. The board book version is durable and a nice size. It's bigger than typical board books, but still not too big for my 1-year-old to pick up and bring to me. I'd give this one 10 starts if I could.

No. But I will watch it with the family every time they do. Honestly I think it is the best Disney movie since Aladin. Mostly for the zany jokes, songs & the warm & fuzzies. Also Mandy Moore is the best singer out there. She came along with the Britney's & Christina's but I think she can out sing them all and probably unlike other singers ( Christina Algulara) knows the words to the national anthem.

B002ZG98C8|5.0|From the opening scene to the credits, \\"Machete\\" was violent, gritty and action packed. What I will say is that you will either love this movie, or hate it. I am one of those that LOVED it. Ok, you should also know that I appreciate Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), Charlie Huston (Author of Hank Thompson series), Wayne Kramer (Running Scared) and Troy Duffy (Boondock Saints). I enjoy the crime noir or pulp noir genre of crime dramas because they tend to generate heated debates and discussions. No matter how you classify them, or what side you fall on (the love or the hate side), these sort of movies produce strong feelings...either negative or positive, and I think that is what most writers and producers hope for. There were some pretty controversial issues woven throughout the story.....vigilantism, immigration, drug abuse, sex, and violence....all of which set the stage for some pretty extraordinary events.  Although the subject matter and the dialog may seem on the surface to be in poor taste and offensive, I viewed it as a vehicle to tell the story, and a very entertaining story at that.     Synopsis:  Day laborer Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) has been approached and hired by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) to shoot Senator McLaughlin (Robert Deniro). This assassination attempt was meant to endear voters to the Senator who is running on a \\"strict regulations against illegal immigrants\\" platform. What's better than a fallen hero?  Anyway, what Booth does not realize is that Machete's past is a little more complicated than he initially realized. Machete is an ex-Federale (Special Agent) who was presumed dead after being shot in the head following a case that went terribly wrong, and even resulted in his wife being beheaded. Now living the simple life as a day laborer, Machete is associated with some very unique characters, among them Luz, a vigilante/activist whose main goal is to help those who truly need rescuing while running a taco truck. Unbeknownst to them both,they are being watched by the very tenacious, ICE Agent Santana Rivera (played by Jessica Alba) who wants to prove herself and bring in the bad guy(s). Meanwhile, Booth is restless and has his own agenda, not to mention a very unstable drug dependant daughter, April (played by Lindsay Lohan) who he has some very impure thoughts about. To complicate matters, Booth also has a relationship with Von Jackson (Don Johnson) an eager border enforcer; and Drug Lord Torrez (played by Steve Seagal), none of which will result in anything positive. Even Machete's brother, Padre Cortez (Cheech Marin) isn't immune to what is going on and finds himself in a precarious position. As the violence escalates and the story unfolds, you see an underworld that contains gun totting nurses, a patch wearing Rodriquez, hired assassins, and dirty politicians, not to mention seeing the knife wielding Machete kill several dozen people who stand in the way of vengeance or justice.      So before passing judgment on the movie, I suggest you just give it a chance. Challenge yourself to look beyond the stereotypes, violence and other things that on the surface are disturbing, and take it for what it is....a story about wrongs being made right, and good overcoming evil. I highly recommend this movie, and think most will enjoy it.
B000267JQK|5.0|another fine cd by seether.their crunchy guitar sound is so sweet and clean.reminds me of the good old days when thrash metal was king.glad to see somebody is carrying the torch for metal.way too much autotune bubble gum pop plastic music now.i will celebrate when pop music comes crashing down in flames and grunge and thrash rule again.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I got my DVD's in a timely manner, they were in fantastic condition and working well. I'm extremely happy with this order and will go to this seller again if I need anything else.
B0026ICMOG|5.0|Great set at a awesome price. This set of the dvd/blu-ray along with the seven dwarfs plush dolls go for more than double on ebay. For those with a disney movie collection this is simply a great buy.
0385341679|5.0|Finally!  The last installment of the series!  I couldn't put this book down!  Finished it in three days that's how great it is.  I would recommend reading the previous books first so you understand what all is going on.  Great read!
0811869261|5.0|My 4.5 year old son is crazy about this book. The first time I gave it to him, he spent about an hour looking at it by himself. We later read it together and moved the stickers around. My only (very minor) complaint is that it is difficult to remove the vinyl stickers from the sticker sheet, so he had to ask for help with that. My child is a huge Richard Scarry fan. I don't think these illustrations are at the same level as Scarry's, but the level of detail is, so if you have a child who gets absorbed in books with multiple narratives on one page, this is the book for you.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I really like the softer side of SOAD, shown on this album. 'Soldier side intro', is a beautiful track, with excellent harmony vocals. I would have been happy for this to have continued. 'Radio/Video' is a fantastic song with almost Bar Mitzvah like music in the softer sections. It is extremely melodic and, again, noteable for the harmony vocals. 'Question' is a Serj led metal/ballad with acoustic guitar verses with melodic heavy choruses. The last track 'Lost in Hollywood' is a really nice ballad. Very nice harmony vocals and a heartfelt lyric.  Lots of humour and insanity resounds around other tracks 'Cigaro' and 'this cocaine..', which are less melodic.  Highly recommended album.
0670022411|5.0|Saw it on a shelf in a shop, could not leave it.  3 days later, my eyes were screaming, housework abandoned, family unfed, unwashed, I came to the end of one of the finest works of fiction (or is it?) I have ever read.  Immediately I looked for the sequel, hoping it would not be too far off.  I found not a trace, my heart sunk...but at least now I can get some work done!    One question, do we REALLY trust Matthew?
B00338QENI|2.0|I LOVE A GOOD TRUE STORY AND JUST A GOOD READ FOR THAT MATTER.  THIS WAS NEITHER.  I WAS VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW ABOUT THE HELA CELLS AND WHAT THEY WERE USED FOR IN RESEARCH, OTHER THAN THAT...NOT SO MUCH.  I DON'T THINK THE BOOK WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING OR WELL WRITTEN...SORRY GANG, THIS REVIEWER DIDN'T FEEL IT WAS WORTH THE READ.
0140544518|5.0|I originally got on Amazon to look for the book \\"The Stinky Cheese Man\\" because I remembered it from when I was a child. My 7 year old is obsessed with fairy tales and I knew she would love a funny book to add to her collection. Amazon suggested a bundle of books, The Stinky Cheese Man, The Frog Prince Continued, and The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs. We love all three! The illustrations are cute and follow the story nicely. The story is told from the wolf's point of view and, in the words of my daughter, shows that there are two sides to every story. This book would make a great addition to any young reader's library.
0790737345|5.0|I'm so glad i picked Amazon.com  they are so fast in getting my movies to me,I give them  5 stars, for the product are so very good,and they are at a real good price,and i will always get my moves from Amazon.com thanks.
0307346617|3.0|Max Brooks displays a lot of creativity in describing how a protracted worldwide zombie apocalypse might progress and eventually be defeated, and his format of short interviews is interesting for the first few chapters. Unfortunately, the book starts to feel like a collection of 5 page short stories after a pretty short while, and the interviews end up being pretty formulaic and repetitive. I got tired of every single interview ending with a pithy quote to sum up the subject's story. This repeated formula makes the interviews seem artificial and contrived. Although there is a wide variety of interview subjects who come from all across the world and different walks of life, they all sound pretty similar. Those that do manage to differentiate themselves are little more than hackneyed stereotypes of tougher-than-nails soldiers or corrupt politicians. Another disadvantage of the interview style is that there isn't much of a continual narrative to follow and become engaged. The writing is alright, yet I think that a lot of the book's repetitiveness can be attributed to a lack of range on Brooks' part.    I found myself forcing myself to finish it. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was pretty disappointed. That being said, it's not awful by any means. Maybe it would be a bit more entertaining as a bathroom book, so one could consume the bite sized stories one by one and perhaps avoid the feeling of monotony that comes from longer reading sessions.
B001J1O83E|5.0|One of the best action films of all time. While in the process of saving his daughters he takes out some of the trash. He also uses some effective enhanced interrogation procedures on assorted human debris that is well deserved. I love how he describes his former career to his daughter in the beginning \\"I was a preventer of bad things.
044654759X|4.0|I enjoyed the book but about half-way thru I started feeling that I'd seen this book as a movie.  There are parts of it that truly remind me of \\"Sleepy with the Enemy.\\"
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|Kelly Clarkson, in my opinion, is the best female vocalist we have seen since Ann Wilson of Heart.  I would have given this a 5 star rating but there are a couple of songs that are just 'ok' for me.  My favorite song by far is \\"Irvine\\".  I know that song is probably the least fave of some of the reviewers but I find the song absolutely brilliant!  Way to go Kelly!
B004AHNIGM|5.0|fans of gregg allman know his voice is better than ever. and the cd is full of great instrumentation from some pretty salty veterans.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|Loved the movie, lots of adventure,not too intense,    not to gorry.  The kids love it, too.  \\"believable science fiction\\" not too \\"out there\\"  The title pretty much tells the story line.
031236198X|2.0|Our Iceberg Is Melting is a short and cute book discussing a serious adult topic. It was lent to me by one of my employees, which made me interested in reading it. The book by change management experts John Kotter and Holger Rathgeber is a fast and easy read and features several adorable illustrations depicting penguins and their habitat. Our Iceberg Is Melting, likely picking up on the theme of Climate Chaos and the recent penguin-themed films, creates a fable of penguins and habitat change to parlay a story about change, how to manage it, deal with it and get groups to adapt and adopt it.<br /><br />One of the best-known books regarding change is undoubtedly [[ASIN:0399144463 Who Moved My Cheese?: An Amazing Way to Deal with Change in Your Work and in Your Life]] by Spencer Johnson. That book was also a succinct read wrapped in the coat of a fable and so comparisons would be logical - even if Johnson had not penned the introduction to this book. Unfortunately, while understanding and being sensitive to the theme and the importance of the topic, I was not a fan of Who Moved My Cheese and the same could be said regarding Our Iceberg...<br /><br />The author attempts to enamour us and simplify the topic by picking a fable and using lovable penguins to boot, but lost in the shuffle is whether a change was necessary in the first place. No proof is offered. One needs to beware and watch for 'change' being used as a crutch and as an excuse for lack of willingness to address issues or drill into problems and challenges. More honestly in this regard would benefit most corporations and entities. Taking for granted that a change was indeed a necessity it is unclear why moving to another iceberg would mean a move to a better environment. Could the new iceberg be undergoing the same change and, therefore, the same problems? Moreover, could the birds be fleeing their problems in lieu of facing and repairing them?<br /><br />The authors' allegories and paradigm might well stand, yet a blanket pro-change statement, without examining need or necessity in the first place, is partly what ails many an organization and is unfair to the reader who is told to stop resisting change or else... and no justification is required. Indeed, the author insinuates that a resistance to change or demanding empirical evidence make one a \\"NoNo.\\"<br /><br />Nevertheless, Kotter and Rathgeber offer the following process for enacting change. This seems simplistic, but essentially rational, although, never mind the propaganda effect of posters, signs and visual cues, alongside the need to sidestep and replace opposing views, which the authors advocate.<br /><br />The process is:<br /><br />1- Create A Sense Of Urgency (act immediately)<br />2- Pull Together The Guiding Team (leadership skills and credibility required)<br />3- Develop The Change Vision And Strategy (contrast the future with the past)<br />4- Communicate For Understanding (convey the vision)<br />5- Empower Others To Act (help those who are onboard)<br />6- Produce Short-Term Wins (an immediate win, no matter how small, is helpful)<br />7- Don't Let Up (accelerate the momentum and push hard)<br />8- Create A New Culture (the new ways need reinforcement for a while).nge statement, without examining need or necessity in the first place, is partly what ails many an organization and is unfair to the reader who is told to stop resisting change or else... and no justification is required.

0312360258|2.0|After a Vampire Tracker Marks her with a crescent moon on her forehead, 16-year-old Zoey Redbird enters the House of Night and learns that she is no average fledgling. She has been Marked as special by the vampyre Goddess Nyx and has affinities for all five elements: Air, Fire Water, Earth and Spirit. But she is not the only fledgling at the House of Night with special powers. When she discovers that the leader of the Dark Daughters, the school's most elite club, is mis-using her Goddess-given gifts, Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace her destiny-- with a little help from her new vampyre friends (or Nerd Herd, as Aphrodite calls them).  This book isn't full of action, and had somewhat of a slow start. Where I was questioning if I would read the whole series. Had some spooks at the end of the book. In the end though turned out to be a pretty good book, and I will possibly read more just because it has a bit of a love story and Im interesting in where that will go. Not all that I thought it was going to be though.
6305342776|3.0|I saw this movie when it comes out in 79 and at that time, I was impressed. Now 30 years later it's still good but I have tho overcome cheesy dialogue and sloppy acting. The special effect still works and the conclusion is not has bad as i remembered.    ideal to bath in nostalgia
030746363X|5.0|I grew up reading body building magazines and health related materials.  Staying in shape always took effort, so I was constantly learning and I fell for a few scams in my day.  This is the first book I've been telling everybody about.  And it's working for them as well.  I've lost 10 pounds in the past month while eating more, in terms of sheer volume, than before and exercising way less (new job... tough to find time...).  The diet is the easiest to stick to I've ever come across.  Even when I go out to the eat with friends, it's not problem finding something on the menu that adheres.  To me, it's straight up science and truth, what works.  I'm not a big fan of other books that come with very little in way of things that work, but a lot of spiritual and psychological mumbo jumbo.
0140143505|5.0|It's like going through a stranger's old letters, only to realize that they have become as dear to you as your own friends. A must read!
B004LQI0HE|4.0|I thought this movie was great! I read the book and they really left out some key points (and for those of you complaining about how depressing the movie version is, don't read the book. you probably couldn't handle it.) but overall, i think they did a good job creating the story. the acting was great and the cinematography was beautiful.
0756405890|4.0|I really enjoyed this first book - I found myself lost in the plot and I really liked the main characters.  The only complaint, really, is it seems to have copied the beginning of the Wizard of Earthsea.  But even so, it can stand on its own merits - it is written much better and more in depth than earthsea ever was.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|LOVe Love Love it!  A friend recommended and I was skeptical.  WRONG!!! Funny and interesting, my favorite characters are Troy and Abed- you will see why...
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Michael Jackson was a creative genius who lived before his time. He took music and entertainment to such a place of depth, that it touched you personally and moved you to want to be better. Only God knows why we had to lose him so soon. Gone, but NEVER EVER forgotten. At least not by me....
